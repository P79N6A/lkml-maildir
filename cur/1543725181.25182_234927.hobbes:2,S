Hi folks,
I've got a DVD drive, which seems to have some problems.
There is a new firmware available, but (as usual) it requires
Windows to install. An update via DOS is not supported. But
I would like to keep my PC Windows-free.
Before I step on the toes of my vendor: Would it be possible
to do a firmware update (IDE, SCSI, USB) within Linux?
Regards
Harri
