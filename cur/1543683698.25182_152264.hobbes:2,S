Subject: DMA not supported with Intel ICH4 I/O controller?

I just read on an Intel site
(
http://64.143.3.64/downloads/drivers/845/perform/linux/udma.htmthat
) "ICH4
requires kernel 2.5.12 or later to enable any DMA mode".  Can you guys
support or refute this?  No wonder I'm having problems with my DMA device on
the ASUS P4PE (using Intel 845PE and ICH4 chipsets)!  Are there any patches,
by chance, against a 2.4.20-8 that will give our system DMA support?  Or
maybe a patch for 2.4.21?  kernel.org shows that the latest (albeit beta)
kernel is 2.6.0-test2 . . . I hestiate to use that, because we would like
something more stable to ship with our product.
Thanks,
