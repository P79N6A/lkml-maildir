OK, accepted - sorry!

Guess this theory is wrong but lets wait and see to prove who is right!

OK, Andrew,
Problem: I do not have internet at home, I am sitting in a friends flat now.
So you cannot expect me to download all git patches of 2.6.20 to test.
Could you please explain the procedure of bisecting?
Above that I've spent hours to find out the essence of the problem and I am really beat to the bone!
And my linuxtv patches should be ported into kernel please, with or without Abraham, with or without Chehab. I swear you that they are OK and not buggy at all.
It is the wrong policy to execute protectionism on people having lots of administration power but in reality lacking the experience, who are not able to tolerate justified criticism.
I enjoyed Gerd and I enjoyed most of all german guys of the convergence crew. Those were real fine and honest people, especially Gerd himself.
Sincerely
Uwe
