Hi All,
I am working on a company project and as a part of it - I have to
collect and show some network information on the Monitoring utility.
Please help to find out that how can I collect these information from
a Linux Machine.
1. Number of active TCP connection
2. Information of Active connections (Source and Dest IP, Source and Dest Port)
3. Retransmitted packets due to Duplicate ACK and SACK
4. Connection Duration and RTT
5. Transmission Troughput (in KB/Sec)
6. Number of Newly Created TCP Connections
7. Closed TCP Connections
8. Total Data transmitted (in byte)
9. Total Data Retransmitted (in byte)
Also, does anybody have any information on Watchdaog or how to use
watchdog and SOCKS and SNOOP Daemon?
I am using RedHat 9.0 machine.
Any help is apreciated. 
Looking for an answer.
