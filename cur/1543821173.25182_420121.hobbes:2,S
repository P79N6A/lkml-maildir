Hello
I upgraded my kernel from 2.6.12 to 2.6.16.11 using make oldconfig.
My machine is DELL Inspiron 510m laptop. Before everything was OK.
Now the kernel hangs for a minute during bootup between the messages
"input: AlpsPS/2 ALPS GlidePoint as /class/input/input2"
and "Advanced Linux Sound Architecture Driver Version 1.0.11rc2 (Wed Jan
04 08:57:20 2006 U
TC)."
During the bootup nothing is printed during the hang, but dmesg contains
this at that point:

Is it normal that the kernel doesn't print all messages to the screen?
What do these messages mean? What should I do
to get rid of the delay?
