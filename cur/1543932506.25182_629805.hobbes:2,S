It's probably less of a pain if you consider that Casey's

The POSIX mac_set_proc(mac_t label) might work for this interface.
Sets the current process MAC attribute, if appropriate. The Smack
implementation would be pretty easy:
typedef char * mac_t;
int mac_set_proc(mac_t label)
{
        int fd;
        int rc;
        rc = strlen(label);
        if (rc > SMACK_MAX_LABEL_LEN)
                return -1;
        fd = open("/proc/self/attr/current", O_RDWR);
        if (fd < 0)
                return -1;
        rc = write(fd, label, rc);
        close(fd);
        if (rc < 0)
                return -1;
        return 0;
}
