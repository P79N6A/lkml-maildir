Huh? What is that about?
I'm concerned with security issues pertaining to architectures
other than Intel, as it is the most widely tested.  Particularly
I'm looking for information for PPC and MIPS architectures, as
those are the ones at my disposal right now (besides of course
Intel).
I've allready dug up a few resources the good old fashioned way,
but I'd like pointers to other ones, preferably specific to PPC
and MIPS arch's.
I'm going to go check out that URL you mentioned now.  Thanks, I
hope it helps me out.  TTYL
