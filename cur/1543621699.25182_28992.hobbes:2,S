Fortunately, I don't think things are quite that bad.  As David
pointed out, on ia64 the readX/writeX stuff is ordered coming out of
the CPU, so if you're in a spinlock protected region, for example, all
the reads/writes you do will occur in order.  The problem that I'm
trying to solve is that on some platforms, I/O space references won't
necessarily occur in order if they come from different CPUs.  E.g.
after you do some I/O and drop a spinlock, another CPU may pick it up
and start doing some I/O that *may* get intermixed with the I/O from
the previous holder of the spinlock unless you explicity barrier said
I/O.
Any ideas on how to address this issue?  I was thinking of either
introducing an I/O space barrier (currently called mmiob() in the 2.5
ia64 patch) or taking the performance hit in mb, rmb, and wmb, as well
as readX/writeX to ensure proper ordering.  Or, as I mentioned in
another mail, we could have a special io_spin_unlock routine that does
the barrier for you.  Comments?
Thanks,
Jesse
