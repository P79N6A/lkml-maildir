   Dave, if you want to play with this and stick it into the qlogicfc.c
None of this topic matters at all for me.  I
just cvs co -date foo qlogicfc_asm.c and edit
qlogicfc.c to include and use it again :-)
It's more important for others people.
If the firmware you point to is indeed suitably licensed, we should
put it into the tree.  If what you're asking me to do is take care
of this, no problem.
Later,
