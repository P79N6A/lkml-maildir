And it's not needed at all. We can see if the program is
doing sequential reading by simply testing for the presence
of pages in the proximity of the faulting address. If there
are a lot of pages present behind the current address then
we should do read-ahead. With pages in front of us we want
read-behind and with no pages or an 'equal' distribution
we want a little bit of both read-ahead and read-behind...

And nobody has gotten around to coding the above hinting code
for mmap() and swap_in() yet... This is a 2.3 issue -- have
patience or code it yourself :)

And once again everybody seems to forget about read-behind --
which is very useful for excutables where the calling function
is often located at the bottom of the C file and also at the
bottom of the object file and thus in front of the function it
will call almost immediately -- read-behind would help a lot in
a case like this...
You should probably rest assured by the fact that I (and Stephen?)
will be working on this as soon as Stephen has done his other
important stuff and I've chewed through a proper scheduler for SMP...
You probably won't see the code integrated before 2.3, so don't
hold your breath :)
cheers,
