nbd-client -d (disconnect) is the main reason -- this functionality 
would be broken if we didn't allow ioctls anymore

Certain ioctls, yes. There's no harm in NBD_DISCONNECT, though.

I agree, NBD_CLEAR_SOCK from another process while nbd_do_it is running 
would cause problems. But, if the user-level tools are coded properly, 
this is not an issue.
Perhaps your ioctl lock scheme, with an exemption for NBD_DISCONNECT 
would work?
