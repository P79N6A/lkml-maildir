Sorry. I was in Malaysia last week so that email probably drowned in the
1600 other mails I found in my backlog when I returned on Friday. I've
found it now in the archives...

I haven't touched rpc_clnt_sigmask() in many years, so that would have
to be some change to the generic signal handling code.
If kmail really is reporting an ENOSPC, though, then it's hard to see
how a signal could produce that particular error.
