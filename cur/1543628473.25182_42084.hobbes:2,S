hi to all,
i need to compile a small program that i made. WHen i try to do it, it 
compiles all right with the -c option ( that is i get the .o file), but if i 
do even the linking it just keep giving me the undefined reference error to 
some kernel functions that i need to use. In particular are the printk, 
filp_open, generic_file_read....  I have included the header files that 
declare them ( kernel.h and fs.h) and i have compiled the program with the 
-D__KERNEL__ and other option used by the compiler when it wants to compile 
a module in the kernel. I tried in many different ways but the error in the 
linking is always the same.
thank you,
boba
