What I had in mind was not a "push" to flush anything anywhere, but 
rather a watch. As a hypothetical, I open a file and every time a 
write() is done a counter is incremented in the fd. That's the easy 
part. Then every time a physical write is completed the count is 
reduced. To allow for write combining the count could be in bytes rather 
than syscalls and physical operations. That's the hard part, I don't 
think the hardware is telling. In addition obviously writes may be 
combined between i/o related to several fds. But if that could be done, 
then fsync becomes "wait until my buffered byte count drops to zero," 
which could be an ioctl. Just having such a checkpoint would address 
some of the data coherency issues.
AFAIK this isn't possible with common ATA devices, and it clearly 
doesn't address every desirable feature. In spite of that, if someone 
better qualified to assess the problems and benefits cares to comment, 
fine. If not, at least I think I explained what I was thinking more clearly.
