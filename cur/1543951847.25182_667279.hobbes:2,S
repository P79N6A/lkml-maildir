Subject: [GIT PATCH] PCI fix for 2.6.25-rc5 git tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is one PCI fix for your 2.6.25-rc5 git tree.
It fixes the duplicate sysfs entry problem as reported by Guennadi
Liakhovetski, now the machine can be properly shut down :)
The problem is also in 2.6.24 and earlier, but there we only get the
warning of a message saying that a link could not be created.  I'll send
a patch for -stable after this goes in as it will not directly apply
there.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/pci-2.6.git/
thanks,
greg k-h
