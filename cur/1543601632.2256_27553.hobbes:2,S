I recall I wrote such code without copying anything, I certainly copied
the way of doing things (pushl dx,cx and save ax via returning it in the
slow path) as I wrote in the comment, but not the code itself. Infact at
first i was probably also pushing eax, and even now that I use the same
logic the two versions should be slightly different. and I think mine
has a race this is why I'm not using such code and with the unfair thing
such code is scheduled for removal since it's unfixable.  really it
sounds like too me too I cut and pasted the static inline void
__down_read(struct rw_semaphore *sem) declarations, since I tend to left
a space between "*" and the variable name but not always.
