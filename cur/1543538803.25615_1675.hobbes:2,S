Its very simple. If you fclose something which is not a valid fopen handle
your program may and will break. On other platforms you should fix it too
quite possibly you are getting away purely by luck and it may either break
or worse yet corrupt data undetected if you dont
	close(bogusvalue)
	returns -1, EBADF
	fclose(bogusvalue)
	is entitled to do as it pleases
