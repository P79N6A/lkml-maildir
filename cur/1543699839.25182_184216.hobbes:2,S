Since you mentioned it - how would you prefer the asct (we need a
better acronym) to detect recursion depth.  Currently, I have those in
a seperate file that should come with the kernel, maybe in
Documentation/recursions or so.  But how about this:
/**
 * RECURSION:	2
 * NAME:	do_recurse
 */
void do_recurse(int recurse)
{
	if (recurse)
		do_recurse(0);
}
Ok, the format is ugly, feel free to pick anything nicer.  But
explicitly stating the recursion depth right where it happens makes
sense to me, as many human readers would like a similar comment
anyway.
Any opinion?
