Please name names, otherwise this is just rumouring.  Seriously.  We 
have enough cargo-cult programming as it is.
A lot of old ISA systems had an option to put a memory hole at 15-16 MB 
to support ISA video cards with linear frame buffer.  It very rarely got 
used, since VLB took over around the same time.
