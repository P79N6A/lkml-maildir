Give us sg_annulus :)
On a more serious note, having played with SG chaining for a couple
of years in the crypto layer, I must say Rusty's proposal is a great
improvement for me.  The reason is that if the crypto layer gets an
SG list from its user, it is not at liberty to just modify it.  As
such chaining at the end is cumbersome with the current interface
because we have to duplicate the whole list in order to add just a
single block at the end.
While with sg_ring we could just put the original list along with the
new one in a new list.
Cheers,
