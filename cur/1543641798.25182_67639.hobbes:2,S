You are correct.  Making an ext2 filesystem on the floppy is indeed 
broken.  Attempting to read/write from the resulting filesystem results in 
the following type errors:
Sep  1 13:18:23 dad kernel: EXT2-fs error (device fd(2,0)): 
ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #11: unaligned directory entry - 
offset=7168, inode=1431634935, rec_len=50, name_len=0
Sep  1 13:20:20 dad kernel: EXT2-fs error (device fd(2,0)):

Sep  1 13:24:38 dad kernel: EXT2-fs error (device fd(2,0)): 
ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #11: rec_len is smaller than 
minimal - offset=7168, inode=0, rec_len=0, name_len=0
Putting a text file on the floppy shows 512 byte chunks of the file being 
moved around depending on how many times the file is read/written.
