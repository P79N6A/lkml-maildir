Can you add the same extra debug code that I asked Dag Bakke to add for
his problem:
-- snip from another email, because I'm lazy ---
Please add a debug printk() to drivers/pci/setup-res.c to the very end of
pci_assign_bus_resource(), just before the "return -EBUSY", something like
        printk("device %s resource %d size %08lx\n", dev->name, resno, size);
just to see what it wants and why it fails..
Also, it's probably worth printing out what the actual bus resources are,
to possibly explain the failure. So add another line that says
        printk("bus res %d %x %08lx-%08lx\n", i, r->flags, r->start,
r->end);
just after the line that says
        if (!r)
                continue;
in the same function.
