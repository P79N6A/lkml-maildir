Hi all,
I'm having a problem with 2.5.1, namely that I can't seem
to get rpm -qa to run correctly. I've done an strace, and
that shows that rpm times out on a select/read/write somewhere.
Easy enough to reproduce, rpm -qa will stall during the run.
This is on linux 2.5.1, with the kill patch backed out.
Regards,
Bas Vermeulen
