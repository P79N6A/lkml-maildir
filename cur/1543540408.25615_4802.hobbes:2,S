Smaller cache footprint is always a win. E.g. when your user program and
the kernel manage to run both in L2 for a working set you save a lot of time.
The key to that is small overall memory/cache footprint of the kernel 
(2.0 was much better in that than 2.4) 
The dcache hash is of course improved in the same way, I just didn't do
a benchmark for it.
AFAIK the main hard hitter of the inode cache is knfsd when its file handle
cache is trashing and it is walking trees all the time
(although 2.4 should be a much better in that than 2.2 because it does not 
need to regenerate the full path in most cases)

You always need to special case the single pointer, no way around that.
