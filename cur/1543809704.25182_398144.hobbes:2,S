To whom it may concern,
Just updated to 2.6.16rc3 in order to get my cdrw drive working on my
thinkpad and noticed the following issue which may be of interest to 
someone. I am using the ata_piix module with the boot option 
"libata.atapi_enabled=1"
The following message is printed many times in the syslog and the output
of dmesg when burning cdrw's with cdrecord:
localhost kernel: Assertion failed! qc->n_elem >
0,drivers/scsi/libata-core.c,ata_fill_sg,line=2573
I am using debian sarge, cdrecord version Cdrecord-Clone 2.01.01a01.
command issued was
"cdrecord -tao -pad -audio -nofix <filename>"
Thanks for your time.
Sincerely,
Brandon Lewis
