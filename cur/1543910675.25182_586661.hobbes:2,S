Hello All,
I have found the source of the problem for the tree not showing
up at 
http://git.kernel.org
. The tree top dir needs to have the
.git suffix. I fixed that now and you can now browse the code online.
I am sorry about the inconvenience but I was not aware of the
restriction.
Anyway, to get a of copy of the perfmon2 kernel tree:
	git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/eranian/linux-2.6.git
Thanks.
