But in RHEL3 the bug is fixed already (not in a released kernel, but the
fix went into our internal kernel some time back and will be in our next
update kernel).  From my internal bk tree for this stuff:
[dledford@compaq RHEL3-scsi]$ bk changes -r1.23
ChangeSet@1.23, 2003-11-10 17:19:54-05:00, dledford@compaq.xsintricity.com
  drivers/scsi/scsi_error.c
      Don't panic if the eh thread is dead, instead do the same thing that
      scsi_softirq_handler does and just complete the command as a failed
      command.
      Change when we wake the eh thread in scsi_times_out to accomodate
      the changes to the mlqueue operations.
      Clear blocked status on the host and all devices in scsi_restart_operations
->    Don't grab the host_lock in scsi_restart_operations, we aren't doing
      anything that needs it.  Just goose the queues unconditionally,
      scsi_request_fn() will know to not send commands if they shouldn't
      go for some reason.
      Make sure we account SCSI_STATE_MLQUEUE commands as not being failed
      commands in scsi_unjam_host.
But, Jens is right, it's a real bug.  I just fixed it in a different
way.  And my fix is dependent on other changes in our scsi stack as
well.
