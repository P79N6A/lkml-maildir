Unfortunately I have been lumbered with 5 of these (insert rude word 
here) boards and have had problems with pretty much every driver.  SATA 
had to be download from SiS's website, PATA is as my patch (no idea why 
a sis5513 driver wasn't coded to detect a sis5513).  I used rev1.1 of 
the sis190.c driver along with a guy from India, he says it works, I say 
it doesn't (but it may be because my test network is 10Meg Half-Duplex). 
  Thank the heavens I am using this as a headless server, sound and 
video are a nightmare as well apparently.
Many thanks for the link, boss is going on holiday next week so as long 
as none of the servers melt down then I should be able to work on this.
Regards
Andrew
