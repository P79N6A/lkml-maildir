Refcounting may be OK if used consistently. 
It is not OK when some pointers are ref-counted, 
but other (in serial_table) are not (like it is
in the current version).
As for the deeper surgery, what do you think about my
earlier suggestion to start by rewriting
usb_serial_probe
to fully initialize usb_serial before it is added to 
serial_table? 
So, instead of the current:
1. create_serial
...
2. mutex_lock(&table_lock);
3. get_free_serial (which inserts serial to
serial_table)
...
4. initializes serial
5. mutex_unlock(&table_lock);
we will get:
1. create_serial
2. initializes serial
3. add_serial_toserial_table  (with internal mutex
lock if needed)
Similar approach should be used in other places to
minimize the code executed under the mutex.
