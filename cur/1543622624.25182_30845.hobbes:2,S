After looking at this some more, I found that the lower case x
in CONFIG_GAMEPORT_CS461x in the Config.in file caused problems,
and the obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_CS614X)   += cs614x.o in the Makefile
appears to be a case of numeric dyslexia, 
where obj-$(CONFIG_GAMEPORT_CS461X)  += cs461x.o is what is really desired.
If this is correct, please apply.
Here is a set of proposed fixes:
