 I'm pretty sure this part is bogus.  Have you actually verified it either
by using a hardware probe or at least by investigating documentation you
really have IRQ 0 routed to the I/O APIC interrupt #0 (INTIN 0)?  If no,
then you can almost surely see interrupts travelling across the pair of
8259A PICS which are connected to the INTIN 0 input of the first I/O APIC
in every IA32-based PC system providing an I/O APIC seen so far.
