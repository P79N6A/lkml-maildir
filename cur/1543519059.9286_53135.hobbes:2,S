After applying Andrea's patch, I have the following message:
set_blocksize: b_count 1, dev ide0(3,1), block 1191392, from c0143af2 
set_blocksize: b_count 2, dev ide0(3,1), block 198730, from c0143af2 
The closest entry in System.map is
c0143aa0 T fat_put_super
Hope this helps in tracking down the bug.  Please let me know if you
need any more details.
Thanks!
