On a related note, should we encourage the use of spin_lock() and
spin_lock_irq() instead of spin_lock_irqsave() where possible?
On some architectures, accessing the interrupt flag is a heavyweight
operation, especially when running under a hypervisor, so a number
of drivers could benefit from being converted to not save the flags
at all instead of just changing the type of the flags variable.
