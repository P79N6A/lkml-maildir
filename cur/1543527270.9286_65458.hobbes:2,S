Because getcwd doesn't follow the paths backwards, it simply knows the
whole path.  Same for `ls -l /proc/self/fd' and `ls -ld /proc/self/cwd'.
Maybe it should be changed.  Do you have a situation where it matters?

Yes they do:
[jamie@thefinal jamie]$ mkdir fum
[jamie@thefinal jamie]$ > fum/a
[jamie@thefinal jamie]$ > fum/b
[jamie@thefinal jamie]$ ls fum
a  b
[jamie@thefinal jamie]$ chmod 000 fum
[jamie@thefinal jamie]$ ls fum
ls: fum: Permission denied
To be more precise, read permission controls whether you can readdir(),
and execute permission controls whether you can lookup entries e.g. to
stat(), open(), readlink() or follow subdirectory etc.
So by disabling read but enabling execute, you can have directory
containing files that people can read or write, but which they can't
list to find out the file names.
As a special exception, root is not subject to permission restrictions
so perhaps that confused you.
have a nice day,
