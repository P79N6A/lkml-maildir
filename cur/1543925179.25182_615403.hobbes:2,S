Magic number alert. That 1 needs to be #defined
#define BOOTMEM_STRICT_GOAL	1
or something. I know it's semi-obvious from the parameter name what it
means but even so. The #define will make it easier for someone to
convert that parameter into a flags bitmap later like gfp flags if that
ever became necessary.

80 char limit violation there. It's not a hard limit but this doesn't
look like a case where the code is much better looking by breaking it.

Tabs vs spaces there.

Aside, it's not obvious why there is a check that looks like
!limit || (limit ...)
if it's not one, it's the other surely :/

Not clear at all why strict_goal is checked here.

tabs vs spaces again. Consider using checkpatch.pl. Its report is not
something that has to be strictly obeyed in all cases but for simply
styling issues like this, it is almost always right.
That aside, this is pretty ugly lookin and it's not clear why setting no
goal and asking for strict_goal results in NULL being returned. Maybe I
am missing the point and this needs commenting. Minimally, multi-statement
lines are frowned upon. For example
if (condition)
	x++;
is preferred to
if (condition) x++;
While the current code could be nicer looking, I don't see why it needs
to change at all. If goal is specified, preferred should start as a
higher value than goal whether strict_goal is set or not. Even if you
want to avoid last_success, it's easier to read
	/*
	 * Start searching from last_success unless strict_goal is
	 * set or the last allocation was over the upper limit. If
	 * we are being strict about allocating above goal, we will
	 * assume the caller does not mind a more expensive search
	 */
	if (!strict_goal && bdata->last_success >= preferred)
		if (!limit || limit > bdata->last_success)
			preferred = bdata->last_success;
or something.

Magic number alert again - use BOOTMEM_ANY_ADDRESS or something. I suck at
naming but once you select a, someone with better naming taste will complain
and give better suggestions.
