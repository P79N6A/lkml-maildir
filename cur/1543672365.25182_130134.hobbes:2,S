Well, since the memory is already alloc'ed as normal user memory, it

Agree, come to think about it, if you write code in fortran it's broken
by default ;-) 
The thing is of course that pesky customers have fortran code they need
to run, and as long there is no g90, and g77 performance sucks, there is
only commercial fortran compilers in play....
