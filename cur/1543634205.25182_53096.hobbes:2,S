I would also hate to have to make 32 system calls to get the affinity
mask I want.
If anything, I think the interface is not collective _enough_ - further
abstractions like psets seem to be in favor, not dropping down to a
one-CPU-and-task per-call thing.  Not that I am complaining, I am happy
with the interface...
