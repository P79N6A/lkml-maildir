I just got a Creative Ensoniq 128.  I made kernels 2.2.13-pre1[5-7] after
getting the new card.  I compiled the es1371 support as a module.  When
loading the modules in the codec vendor line I get 2 odd symbols which don't
log well (<83><84> in less) which are followed by v revision 9.
The second thing I was wondering about was the OSS behavior.  The only thing
listed in my /dev/sndstat (besides the titles for categories) is 0: System
Clock.  Yet when I use a program like XMMS and use the OSSlib method of output
I can select a seemingly blank audio device and mixer, and they function
perfectly fine.
The last thing I was wondering is, can Soft OSS be told to use the 2nd audio
device with this card and not the 1st one.  Or is there a better recommended
way to get midi support for things like DOOM and LOSER Corp..
