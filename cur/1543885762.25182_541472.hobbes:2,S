I now have a use case for maintaining a per-container task list.
I am trying to build a per-container stats similar to taskstats.
I intend to support container accounting of
1. Tasks running
2. Tasks stopped
3. Tasks un-interruptible
4. Tasks blocked on IO
5. Tasks sleeping
This would provide statistics similar to the patch that Pavel had sent out.
I faced the following problems while trying to implement this feature
1. There is no easy way to get a list of all tasks belonging to a container
   (we need to walk all threads)
2. There is no concept of a container identifier. When a user issues a command
   to extract statistics, the only unique container identifier is the container
   path, which means that we need to do a path lookup to determine the dentry
   for the container (which gets quite ugly with all the string manipulation)
   Adding  a container id, will make it easier to find a container and return
   statistics belonging to the container.
If we get these two features added to the current patches, it will make the
infrastructure more "developer" and eventually more user friendly :-)
