The following lines are pulled out of drivers/video/vesafb.c (2.4.20):
Line 646 onwards..
> if (mtrr) {
>         int temp_size = video_size;

In the first place, the power of two computation computes the largest
power of 2 that is _smaller_ than video_size, so it looks like an
off-by-1 bug.

Secondly, what's the point of requesting a smaller write-combining
segment that won't cover all the video memory being used? If it fails
the first time round, shouldn't we either give up or attempt requesting
several contiguous segments?
