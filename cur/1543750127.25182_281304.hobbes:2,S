Ah, ok. Now at least I know what this messages mean! Indeed, as I wrote
in the first mail, 1.7GB of the 2GB memory of the machine were in use,
and that was "real" usage, i.e., without any buffers. But that was already
three hours after the failure occured. Unfortunately we didn't check what
process was using how much memory because we just rebooted as quick as
possible to get the server processes running again.
Might be a memory leak in some application, because neither the mysql
database nor the tomcat server should take more than a few hundred MB
of memory alltogether. I will ask the user to redo the mysql database
dump, maybe that was it and we can trigger the failure again. But that
will take two weeks until everyone is back in office :-)

Yes, sure! If we can reproduce it, I will send the log and try to figure
out which process takes so much memory. Thanks for your help!
