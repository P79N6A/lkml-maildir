That's a good question, but the BIOS code you're talking about is not 
part of the kernel.  Sure, it's possible that it might still corrupt the 
kernel, but it's not being loaded into it as a module.  The developer of 
the BIOS code never intended for their code to be run by the Linux kernel.
Is it still dangerous?  Yes.  Is it a violation of the GPL?  No.
Also, developers of modules which thunk to BIOS code are aware of the 
potential problems and are typically willing to take responsibility for 
investigating bugs in their own code.  (Bugs in the BIOS means you're 
screwed and need to get new hardware.)  Developers of proprietary 
drivers are notoriously unhelpful when it comes to fixing bugs in their 
code.
