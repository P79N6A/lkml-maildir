what's your primary limitation? physical memory or virtual address
space? if it's physical memory go with 2.6-aa and it'll work fine up to
32G boxes included at full cpu performance.
if it's virtual address space and you've not much more than 4G of ram
3.5:1.5 usually works fine, and againt you'll run at full cpu
performance.
also make sure to move the task_unmapped_base at around 200M, so that
you get 1G more of address space for free.
