  The card is a serial ata controller with what adaptec refers to as 
"hostraid".  (Meaning the raid is done in the driver.)  There are binary 
drivers for it on adptec's site, but no open source drivers.  The binary 
drivers are fairly good, but they are binary drivers.  (Which brings the 
headaches that binary drivers entail.)
