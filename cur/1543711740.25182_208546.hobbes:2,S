Can you explain about the timing?

Well, nobody is going to use anything except reiser4 are they?;-).....
I think that we are able to guarantee that the write is fully atomic 
regardless of what the block layer does, so long as the block layer 
respects our ordering and does not cache it where it should not.
zam, you are watching this thread about flushing the ide cache I hope....
