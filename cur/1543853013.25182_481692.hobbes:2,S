The most important question:
What filesystem is your /boot on? I'd bet quite some money that it is reiser
or some other journaling FS (not ext3).

I am pretty sure that it will also happen if you do "updatedb &", wait a

I am pretty sure that it has nothing to do with the kernel version, just with
the layout of your /boot partition (which of course changes with every kernel
update). In other words: until now, you just have been lucky.
