My basic hdparm timing test shouldn't show much of a difference
with NCQ tests, becase hdparm just does a single request at a time,
and waits for the results before issuing another.  Now, kernel read-ahead
may result in some command overlap and a slight throughput increase, but..
Something like dbench and/or bonnie++ are more appropriate here.
Cheers
