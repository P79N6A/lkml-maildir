Hmmm. I need about 4MB linear memory (kmalloced). If my computer
(a 64MB Cyrix) runs for more than a day, it's over with rmmod/insmod
of the driver. Out of memory! Tracing it back, it seems to originate
from the updatedb which runs each night. Lots of irritating single
parenthensis^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hfragments!
