That is true if it is a uni processor but in smp the initialization,
if happened in two different CPUs, affects performance due to cache
effects.
The problem of object (skb) allocation, usage and deallocation occurring
in multiple CPUs need to be addressed separately. This patch is not
attempting to address that.

You still can do this. I don't see skbinit patch hindering this.
