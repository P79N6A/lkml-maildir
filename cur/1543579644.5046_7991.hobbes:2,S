I took out my can of RAID and went bug hunting.
The kernel was always crashing in this subroutine and the comment near the
list walk clued me in.
I've run this fixed kernel all night and can no longer make it OOPS from a
racy list walk.
It may be overkill to use ppp_lock instead of the finer grained locks but it
works great so far
and I don't believe this routine gets called a lot.
