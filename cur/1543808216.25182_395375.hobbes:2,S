    Exactly, Joerg, why do YOU like to introduce a different naming
scheme? UNIX uses /dev/whatever, Win32 uses <UNIT>:, etc. Why do you
want to break those names, which are familiar to the user?

    I don't know any program, except cdrecord and family, which uses
your naming scheme, but I will more than happy to hear examples, look
at them and change my mind if I finally get convinced that the naming
scheme you're using is finally better. But instead of telling me to
look into the real world, tell me examples, please. I don't have at
home any SCSI bus and so I don't use SCSI related programs.
    Thanks in advance :)
