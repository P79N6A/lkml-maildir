Hi , Len 
Thanks for replying
So:
1 - ACPI w/o CONFIG_PM (is not supported)
2 - If accidentally we configure ACPI w/o CONFIG_PM. I tested and
doesn't power off correctly (at least on one Dell Precision 410). 
3 - It is easy make this error in configuration, especial if we try use
.config from early versions.
4 - The patch doesn't hurt at all, just force to one correct
configuration.

I understand very well your point, and I don't check in kernel 2.6.5
Config.in, neither check in others architectures.
But I vote for apply this patch, because can avoid problems with
power-off machines.
Off-topic: I am testing last acpi-2.4.27 patch and it ok, no complains.
I resend the patch just in case.
thanks,
