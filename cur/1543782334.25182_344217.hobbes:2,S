PS: note that it's not
	depends on PCI
it's
	depends on PCI || BROKEN
which
	a) documents that something is wrong
	b) leaves all setups usable now intact
	c) prevents broken setups from being picked.
I certainly agree that proper fix is to switch to dma_... - no arguments here.
BTW, another dubious thing is use of DECLARE_PCI_UNMAP_ADDR() in infiniband
core - it's fine in PCI drivers (which is how it's used elsewhere), but not
in generic data structures.
