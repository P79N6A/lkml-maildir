Note, however, that the use of flush_dcache_page() on allocations
derived from dma_alloc_coherent() is undefined and unpredictable.
dma_alloc_coherent() may return a remapped virtual address which
would be invalid for things like virt_to_page() to operate on.
So the fact that dma_alloc_coherent() returning something that was
kmalloc'd and then causing flush_dcache_page() to oops is actually
a sign that there's far deeper problems.
