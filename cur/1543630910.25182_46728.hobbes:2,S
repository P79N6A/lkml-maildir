You don't get the rights of the group.  This only allows the
file/directory you could have created anyway to be created with the
gid of the parent.  And you still are the owner so it can be
seen who is responsible for it existing.
The only possible way non-members could do this would be if
the directory has dangerous^Wrisky permissions allowing non-group
members to write in it.
I use sgid directories frequently.  Usually with
user-private-groups and umask of 002. It keeps lusers from
misusing chmod.

_Please_ don't describe it this way.  We don't want any
files any time to be created with suid flag set
automatically.  Describe it as "the suid flag set _on_ the
directory" or "suid directory", etc.

Group quotas are used even less than user quotas so i don't
consider them much of an issue (someone else probably does).
What i do consider an issue is user accountability.  There
are reasons besides quota only root can chown.
You haven't articulated how doing this would be of benefit to
anyone.  Leaving that aside you could work up a patch to
allow this behaviour.
Features would be:
	1 a non-default mount option. 
	2 either incompatible with quota or throwing up
 	  warnings if quota is enabled.
	3 ineffective if the directory is also sticky.
Personally i don't care for the idea but, hey, you can try.
As long as it doesn't become a default it won't affect me.
