One scenario we haven't covered is that we have a VGA card in a box,
which we don't care about being re-initialised after a suspend/resume.
A lot of cluster nodes have vga cards in them just so that they boot,
and you can plug a monitor and keyboard in to change BIOS settings.
The machines are never accessed except over the LAN in normal use, but
it's quite possible that you'd want to suspend the whole cluster
overnight, for example, or at least some nodes which were not in use,
and you wouldn't care about the VGA card being restored.
John.
