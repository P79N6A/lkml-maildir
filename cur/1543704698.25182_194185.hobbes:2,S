The new cluster for directory entries must be initialized by 0x00.
And, when the directory entry is deleted, the name[0] is updated by
0xe5 not 0x00.
So, if the name[0] is 0x00, it after, all bytes in cluster is 0x00.
The fat driver can stop at name[0] == 0x00, but this is just optimization.
The behavior shouldn't change by this.
