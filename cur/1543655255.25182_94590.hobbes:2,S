Subject: POSSIBLE BUG: Debugging Not Automatically Activated in Slab.c
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Before I submit this as an actually bug, I'd like the input of some people
who know a little more about the Slab Allocator and Kernel Debugging.
The Slab Allocator includes this line:
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
in slab.c (line 89) to activate debugging.
However, I couldn't find anywhere in the code where CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB is
linked to CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL.  In other words, setting the kernel as a
debug kernel doesn't automatically set the Slab Allocator to debug too.
1) Am I missing something?
2) Is this intentional or by design?
If this is an actually bug, it can be fixed by inserting the following code
in slab.h immediately following the #include statements:
#ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL
#define CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB
#endif
