Yes, Andrea's do_no_page enforced some tests which I found confusing and
unhelpful, so I didn't propagate them to mainline when porting his rmap.

Well, beware.  That "page_count() != page_mapcount() + 2" check in rmap.c
went away in 2.6.13: the problem it was there to solve being solved
instead by a can_share_swap_page based on page_mapcount instead of
page_count (partly to fix a page migration progress problem).
So, you may still be in trouble?  But how do the pages you're concerned
with come to be on the LRU in the first place?  If they're not on the
LRU, vmscanning will never try to take them away.  Most drivers with
special pages, and ->mapping unset, don't put the pages on the LRU.

Nick's PageReserved/VM_RESERVED changes are not in 2.6.14 so I'd expect
2.6.15 there.  Ah, you're trying to handle this awkward interval before
2.6.15-rc1 brings the numbering up to 2.6.15, okay.
