News to me. There were some Radeon problems with reset breaking VIA
boards but those should be fixed if you are running 2.4.19-ac and
XFree86 4.2. I don't know fi the ALi is showing the same problem.
Another cause of freezes is incorrect AGP settings. Make sure the AGP
setting in the BIOS and XF86Config match. X defaults to 1x which is ok
for most but not all chipsets as a fallback
