Performance of what?  I'm not asking for a cache flush, I'm just
asking for write(/dev/hda1) being identical (would it be working or
non-working) to write(/dev/hda+appropriate sector offset).  Nothing
more, nothing less.  This has nothing to do with whether there is a
mounted filesystem in the given partition.  It is only the presence of
the mounted filesystem shows the difference.
Of course, /dev/md is another problem entirely.
  OG.
