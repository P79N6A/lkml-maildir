Makes sense.  Then something like
	if (old_nd->dentry->d_inode->i_op->copy) {
		ret = old_nd->dentry->d_inode->i_op->copy(old_nd->dentry,
				mode, new_dentry);
		if (ret != -ENOSYS)
			return ret;
	}
Also, would it be possible to do essentially the same with sendfile()?
That should bring roughly the same speedup for disk based filesystems,
and would be a bit more general.
