I haven't overlooked the fact that the pci_read_config_dword will
do the byte swapping.  But it will do the byte_swapping for a
dword (32-bits), not for two words (16-bits), and the byte-swapping
for 32-bits is not the same as for two words.
Specifically:
Little-endian dword:
          3    2      1    0
         80  86    71 11
when read in by the pci_read_config_dword,  will swap it to :
        0    1      2     3
        11 71     86  80
For little endian you get device id (bytes 2,3) as 0x8086,
and vendor id of 0x7111.  For big endian you get device
id of 0x7111 and vendor id of 0x8086.
The pci_read_config_dword works just fine for dword
data types, like the base addresses.  But the fundamental
rule of big-endian/little-endian code is that you have to
know the size of the data type that you are working with,
so that you can byte swap properly.  Reading a dword
(and byte-swapping for a dword) is not the same as
reading two words (and byte-swapping them as words).

Contrast this with replacing the read_config_dword with
reading two words:
Instead of:
if (pci_read_config_dword(temp, PCI_VENDOR_ID, &l))
  return NULL;
     ....
  memcpy(dev, temp, sizeof(*dev));
 dev->vendor = l & 0xffff;
 dev->device = (l >> 16) & 0xffff;
It would seem that we need:
 if (pci_read_config_word(temp, PCI_VENDOR_ID, &vendor))
  return NULL;
 if (pci_read_config_word(temp, PCI_DEVICE_ID, &device))
  return NULL;
