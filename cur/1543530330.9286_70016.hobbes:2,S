That is a perfectly reasonable way to approach the problem.  IMO, the
alternative is a hack:  for each page in the user space buffer, you need
to fault it into RAM, or more likely, fault it into existence.  Then you
need to lock it into RAM and reserve each page.  For the vmalloc'd
solution, you just need to reserve each page.
It also isn't riddled with potential security holes.  Imagine DMA'ing
into the C library.
