Which is a bug, and you want to catch it.

If it is due to a security bug, then the fix is to fix the point
where the kernel starts trusting an untrusted value. Not to hide
the bug like this. Arguably, a BUG_ON is better in the case of a
security hole because you want to halt the process as soon as you
detect a problem.
