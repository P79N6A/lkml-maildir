Subject: 2.6.21-rc3: suspend broken on Thinkpad R60

Hi,
suspend (to RAM and disk) broke on my Thinkpad R60 (Core 2 Duo laptop)
somewhere between 2.6.20 and 2.6.21-rc3 (commit
8ce5e3e45e01ffab38a9f03900181132b9068543), but most likely before -rc2. In
contrast to previous reports I saw on the list, it actually hangs at
suspend, not resume.
On suspend to RAM (either through s2ram or through /sys/power/state) it
hangs after the message "Suspending consoles" with the sleep LED flashing.
Suspend to disk hangs similarly after "Snapshotting system".
Is this a known issue? Should I git-bisect it? I'm running Debian with a
custom-compiled x86_64 SMP kernel.
