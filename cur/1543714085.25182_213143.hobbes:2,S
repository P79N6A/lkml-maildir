The code is different anyway because the glibc routine clobbers
t7 register which must not be touched in the kernel.
Apparently the whole mess started with a typo in the register
renaming patch...
Yes, ideally glibc and kernel stxncpy code can be exactly the same,
but this assumes that the glibc variant is updated to not use the t7.
