This issue just came up yesterday on the RTLinux mailing list.
gcc will generate 'call memset' and 'call memcpy' in several
situations relating to automatic variables.  In particular, the
following code will generate a 'call memset'[1]:
{
	char str[12] = "mystring";
	...
}
There are several ways to solve this problem, including modifying
gcc not to emit such code when it is not appropriate, adding hard
declarations of memset, memcpy, etc. to the kernel, and possibly
just saying that code that causes gcc to generate 'call memset'
is not supported.  I really have no opinion on the matter.

[1] On the RTL list, I made a fool of myself by effectively saying
"bullshit, I don't believe it."  So here is the example:
it.c:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
	char str[12]="mystring";
	printf(str);
	return 0;
}
cc -S it.c
it.s:
	.file	"it.c"
	.version	"01.01"
gcc2_compiled.:
.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"mystring"
.globl memset
.text
	.align 4
.globl main
	.type	 main,@function
main:
	pushl %ebp
	movl %esp,%ebp
	subl $12,%esp
	movl $.LC0,%eax
	movl (%eax),%edx
	movl %edx,-12(%ebp)
	movl 4(%eax),%edx
	movl %edx,-8(%ebp)
	movb 8(%eax),%al
	movb %al,-4(%ebp)
	leal -3(%ebp),%eax
	pushl $3
	pushl $0
	pushl %eax
	call memset
	addl $12,%esp
	leal -12(%ebp),%eax
	pushl %eax
	call printf
	addl $4,%esp
	xorl %eax,%eax
	jmp .L1
	.align 4
.L1:
	leave
	ret
.Lfe1:
	.size	 main,.Lfe1-main
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 2.7.2.3"
