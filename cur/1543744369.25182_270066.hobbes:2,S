Perhaps someone could comment on why the keyboard thread is NOT higher 
priority? The whole functionality of SysReq key combinations would seem 
to depend on actually seeing the strokes. I would cautiously suggest 
that a priority control in /proc/sys might be a useful interface, 
certainly compared to patching the kernel and rebuilding.
Yes, I mean an option in the mainline kernel, so when debugging hangs 
the keyboard could be used.
