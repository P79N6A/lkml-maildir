(For some reasons I haven't got your answer in my mailbox, found it in
archives)
Thank you for these pointers. I was looking at ext4 code and found haven't
found what they do in these cases. I think I need some hints to realize
what's going on there. Our FS is so different from traditional ones
- e.g., we do not use buffer heads, we do not have block device
underneath, etc, so I even doubt I can borrow anything from ext4.
I have impression that I just have to implement my own list of
inodes and my own victim-picking policies. Although I still think it
should better be done on VFS level, because it has all these LRU lists,
and I'd duplicate things.
Nevertheless, I add Teo on CC in a hope he'll give me some pointers.
