I switched cables, checked the switch etc....
nothing helps.
I installed an extra PCI card which came up as eth0, making the internal ones 
eth1 and eth2. No I started pinging with eth0, which was giving me strange 
effects again.
eth0 = 192.168.47.11
eth1 = 192.168.47.12
eth2 = 192.168.47.13
I took a tcpdump on the receiving box. It was kind of interesting.
There were arp packages askin who is 192.168.47.11 and answers coming back 
with two dofferent MAC-Id's One from the eth0 and the other one from the eth2 
which was actually configured on  IP .13
 After I shut down etho1 and 2 and ran the box with "noapic" it preforms 
perfect with the external card.
Either the NIC's are broken, or the driver  or whatever. I hate that !!
