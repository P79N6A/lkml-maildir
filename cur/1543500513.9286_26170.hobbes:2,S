Then move to a distribution with proper install scripts and testing.
The pre-install script from Debian's libc6-dev package:
=== begin script ===
#!/bin/sh
set -e
# Remove old symlinks, if they exist
if [ -L /usr/include/asm ] ; then rm -f /usr/include/asm ; fi
if [ -L /usr/include/linux ] ; then rm -f /usr/include/linux ; fi
if [ -L /usr/include/scsi ] ; then rm -f /usr/include/scsi ; fi
=== end script ===
There's really no excuse for being so sloppy with a distribution as to not 
test that upgrades work irrespective of the version you're coming from.
I guess you should report a bug against the RedHat 6.0 glibc-devel package.
David.
