Just curious, what exactly do you mean by "lots of penguins"?  I assume
you mean processes?  What do penguins have to do with anything. ;)

Actually running?  That would be bad.  It would mean that we'd have to
preempt another processor, which I gather is a very expensive thing to do.
If you mean that when scheduling is already happening, run processes with
a kernel lock before processes without one, I don't know.  It may be worth
benchmarking to decide.
