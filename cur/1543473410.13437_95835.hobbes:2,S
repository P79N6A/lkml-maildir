I'm updating a Slackware 3.2 install (other than our proxy server; this
is a fresh install) with kernel 2.0.36. Read on and see what happened.
menuconfig round 1: nothing as a module, but with kerneld support
included. Compiles and boots ok. Some error messages which I correct
commenting out lines in /etc/rc.modules. Those net-pf-something appear
too. I eliminate them using /etc/conf.modules. No problem. But at the
boot I see messages complaining about char-major-10. I remember that's
caused by nosy clock startup which inquiries the RTC. So...
menuconfig round 2: same as above, but with RTC included. Errors at the
ld phase. Many .o's complain about no block_dev symbol present.
menuconfig round 3: I get p***ed off and take out RTC and even module
support. Won't need 'em anyway. Now when I compile block_dev.c it
complains about errors in include/linux/tty.h in line 209 -- beginning
with a warning about there not being a ";" after a structure definition.
That line reads like this:
struct tty_struct {
    (blah blah)
    struct termios *termios, *termios_locked;   <=== This is the one
    (blah)
};
I change it to
struct tty_struct {
    (blah blah)
    struct termios *termios;
    struct termios *termios_locked;
    (blah)
};
...and everything compiles fine!!! Yikes! Now even the call to depmod is
history. My boot is lean, mean and fast. Everything works. But man is
this weird! Last time I checked there was absolutely no problem in
placing field definitions in a C structure, separated by commas.
Poltergeist? My gcc is 2.7.2.1, libc is 5.4.23.
Cherrs,
