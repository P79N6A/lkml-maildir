As far as MSDOS and Windoze is concerned, the partition table is
ONE sector in length - it consists of offsets 447 to 510 of the
first sector of the disk, with offsets 0 to 446 comprising the
Master Boot Record and offsets 511 to 512 being the boot block
signature.
The reason for the 32 sector offset to the start of the partition
on zip disks is because DOS and Windoze require the partition to
start on a track boundary - zipdisks declare 32 sectors per
track. Software such as PartitionMagic and the like take
advantage of this by storing their boot code in those otherwise
unused sectors.

I don't know HFS so can't comment thereon...

If it is, that'd certainly be the best choice.
Best wishes from Riley.
