Very true, there are a few different workloads to consider.
1) The box really needs ram right now, and we should do the minimum amount
of work to get it done.  This is usually done by kswapd or a process doing
an allocation.  It should help if the FS gives the VM enough details to
skip pages that require extra allocations (like commit blocks) in favor of
less expensive ones.
2) There's lots of dirty pages around, it would be a good idea to flush
some, regardless of how many pages might be freeable afterwards.  This is
where we want most of the i/o to actually happen, and where we want to give
the FS the most freedom in regards to which pages get written.

This probably helps in both situations listed, assuming things like HIGHMEM
bounce buffers don't come into play.
