Any updates on this for us? Or did the kernel start booting magically again
ca. 2.6.23-rc6? ;-)
Anyway, it appears the bug got introduced sometime between 2.6.20 and
2.6.22 so probably bugzilla becomes a better place to track this one. Could
you open up a bug report (similar to your original post) there?
Thanks,
Satyam
