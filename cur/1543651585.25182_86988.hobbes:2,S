I had tried to list these in an earlier mail, added a few more
comments now marked by ">>"
1.Enabling IPI to collect CPU state on all processors in the
  system right when dump is triggered (may not be a normal
  situation, so NMIs where supported are the best option)

2.Ability to quiesce (silence) the system before dumping 
  (and if in non-disruptive mode, then restore it back)

3. Calls into dump from kernel paths (panic, oops, sysrq
   etc).

4. Exports of symbols to help with physical memory 
   traversal and verification
