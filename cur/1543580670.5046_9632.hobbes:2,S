I wrote the initial patch using the info I gathered for my
performance-monitoring counters driver. Petr Vandrovec tested
and debugged it. (Alas, I don't yet have a K7 to play with.)
It seems K7 BIOSen keep the local APIC enabled as opposed to
what P6 BIOSen tend to do (at least, Petr's ASUS A7V did),
so in a sense, yes "it just works". The clock denoted by the
event selector is not perfect (it slows down by a factor of
100 when the CPU is idle), but the NMIs do keep coming in.
I might have been able to whip up something better, if AMD
hadn't required an NDA for the K7 BIOS writer's manual. My
regard for them is pretty low right now.
