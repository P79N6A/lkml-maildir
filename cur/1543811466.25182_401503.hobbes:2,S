Could you be more specific ? Is it the way its coded or the design 
(preallocate, then assign)
itself ?
The function needs to allocate task_delay_info structs for all tasks 
that might
have been forked since the last time delay accounting was turned off.
Either we have to count how many such tasks there are, or preallocate
nr_tasks (as an upper bound) and then use as many as needed.
Thanks for reviewing so quickly.
