Yes.  Intel has defined the LSB of the physical APIC ID to be the 
"hyperthreading" bit.  Even numbered IDs are real CPUs; odd IDs are the 
virtual CPUs.  (Or, as wli calls them, Schwarzenegger and Di Vito. ;^)
This may complicate Rusty's zen scheduler scheme.  It certainly has made life 
complicated for the BIOS folks.  They had to sort all the real CPUs to the 
front of the ACPI table, lest those folks so benighted as to run the crippled 
version of Win2K (which only on-lines 8 CPUs) only get four real CPUs out of 
eight.
Anyway, with Intel's new numbering scheme you only get two real CPUs per 
logical cluster of 4, which is kind of a pain....
