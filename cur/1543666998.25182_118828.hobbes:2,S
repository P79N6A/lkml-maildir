There is a point I'd like to get clear: where should the 16bit<->32bit 
dev_t conversion happen?
I think any software that cares about this should be safe by now. That 
leaves us with on-disk and on-wire formats and IMO only at these places a 
conversion should happen.
The other problem is how can software create nodes for a specific device?
bye, Roman
