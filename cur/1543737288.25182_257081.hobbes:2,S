Hello, Marcelo.
Generic memory defragmentation will be very nice for me to implement
hugetlbpage migration, as allocating a new hugetlbpage is a hard job.

I think it's possible to introduce non-wait mode to the migration code,
as you may expect. Shall I implement it?

I always test it with the zone hotplug emulation patch, which Mr.Iwamoto
has made. I usually run following jobs concurrently while zones are added
and removed repeatedly on a SMP machine.
      - making linux kernel
      - copying file trees.
      - overwriting file trees.
      - removing file trees
      - some pages are swapped out automatically:)
And Mr.Iwamoto has some small programs to check any kind of page
can be migrated. The programs repeat one of following actions:
    - read/write files .
    - use MAP_SHARED and MAP_PRIVATE mmap()'s and read/write there.
    - use Direct I/O.
    - use AIO.
    - fork to have COW pages.
    - use shmem.
    - use sendfile.

Any comments are very welcome.
Thank you,
