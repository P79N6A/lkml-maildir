The real problem is that the symbol (in that case the function) is not
exported if defined static.
e.g.:
$ cat >foobar.c <<EOF
> static void foo(void) {}
> extern void foo(void);
>
> void bar(void) {}
> EOF
$ gcc -c foobar.c
$ nm foobar.o
00000005 T bar
00000000 t foo
from the nm manpage:
The  symbol  type. ... If lowercase, the symbol is local; if
uppercase, the symbol is global (external)
i.e. foo is local
see 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/9/4/495
 for what ANSI C Std has to say
about that and about the proposed change.
But, don't ask my why the void functions with empty function bodies
are exported.

in that case the symbol would not even be local as it is not used with
the translation unit.
$ nm
00000005 T bar
