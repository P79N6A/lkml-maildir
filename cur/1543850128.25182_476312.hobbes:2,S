Hi Oleg,
Yes, it works for me, with the exception of host-generated
files, as you mentioned.  I ran into those with:
IKCONFIG (the one that you mentioned), ATM_FORE200E firmware,
IEEE 1394 OUI database (which I sent a patch for -- it should
not be generated when the config option is not enabled),
RAID456 tables, VIDEO_LOGO files, and CRC32 table.
Thanks for your time and effort.  Maybe Sam will have some ideas.
