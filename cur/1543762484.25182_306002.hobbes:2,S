Unfortunately the celebration was premature.  I compiled 2.6.12-rc1,
noticing the new feature that you can see or alter the swap device 
number in /sys/power/resume.  So I'm able to suspend... but not to
resume, since the driver still isn't loaded at the time of resuming.
I tried some cowboy programming like this: in kernel/power/disk.c I
changed software_resume to be not static (i.e. extern) and not a
late_initcall.  In init/main.c, in init(), just after do_basic_setup(),
I inserted a call to software_resume().  This did not even cause a
kernel panic as I had expected; there was no sign on the console, in
/var/log/boot.msg or anywhere else that software_resume had ever been
called, even with a suspended image in the swap partition.
It was worth a try, but not much more, since I'm sure there are
contingencies that I'm not taking into account.  For example, the real
root filesystem is mounted (readonly), and if that makes a problem
for resuming, how can we squeeze software_resume after the initrd and
before mounting the root disc?
