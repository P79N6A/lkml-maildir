with modern tape drives, when you fall out of streaming mode you are lucky 
to get 1/10 of the rated drive performance (not to mention the extra wear 
and tear on the tape and the drive)
the common thing is to do disk->disk->tape backups. use rsync to pull your 
data from the remote machines to your server, then use tar on the server 
to make the one image you want to put on the tape (frequently onto a 
different drive), then record that image to tape.
note that tar is not nessasarily the best format to use for this in the 
face of tape errors (see backup software companies for details, several 
years ago I read an interesting document from the bru backup folks that 
went into details)
