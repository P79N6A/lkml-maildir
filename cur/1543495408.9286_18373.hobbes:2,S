    16gb is stupidly small?
    Oookay.
    16gb is still an awful lot of data, really, and it's certainly large
    enough to slop comfortably over the edge of however much memory you
    can fit onto a PC box.
    In any case, it appears to be a dataset where NT can win comfortably
    over Linux, so whining about it won't help.  (And isn't whining
    about it traditionally what Microsoft does when faced with a
    benchmark that shows them in a bad light?  Wouldn't it be more
    productive to not whine but instead fix the problem?)
