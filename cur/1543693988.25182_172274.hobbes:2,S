no, testcase is not available :( And it uses functionality
not available in mainstream kernel. But the problem can be hit with
very simple script instead:
1. mount N filesystems.
2. work on them, so that inode cache grows to its maximum
possible size (it was 1,000,000 of inodes in our case).
3. umount these filesystems.
During operation #3 node is very slow and it is quite noticable
on ssh console when typing commands.
