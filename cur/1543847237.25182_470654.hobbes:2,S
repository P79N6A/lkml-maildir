Subject: [PATCH 0 of 23] Unionfs: Stackable Namespace Unification Filesystem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/7/35

This set of patches constitutes Unionfs version 2.0. We are presenting it to
be reviewed and considered for inclusion into the kernel.
Some of the comments addressed since the first submission are:
- unionfs_lookup must pass lookup intents to the lower filesystem (Trond
  Myklebust)
- patches reordered (Stephen Rothwell)
- numerous style comments by Jan Engelhardt
Note that this set of patches contains a considerably trimmed-down version
of Unionfs.  That way it'd be possible to evaluate Unionfs's most basic
functionality, gradually adding features in future patches.
To download tarballs of the full source, along with userspace utilities,

Known Issues and Limitations:
- The NFS server returns -EACCES for read-only exports, instead of -EROFS.
  This means we can't reliably detect a read-only NFS export.
- Modifying a Unionfs branch directly, while the union is mounted, is
  currently unsupported.  Any such change may cause Unionfs to oops and it
  can even result in data loss!
- Unionfs shouldn't use lookup_one_len on the underlying fs as it confuses
  NFS. Currently, unionfs_lookup passes lookup intents to the lower
  filesystem, this eliminates part of the problem. The remaining calls to
  lookup_one_len may need to be changed to pass an intent.
For the initial release we removed support for xattrs, persistent inode
mappings, and mmap operations.
