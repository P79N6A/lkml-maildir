Sockets also were not standardised for the longest time. Doesn't mean you
can just make up your own semantics. Tradition also counts.

Yes, and the second part. Why not give get the same courtesy ?

Yes, it returns the size of some internal implementation detail, while the
fudged value would be good enough to have it roughly mean the traditional
thing, which is an order of magnitude more useful.
The best solution to mee seems to fudge get, and introduce a new sockopt
(LINUX_SNDBUF or something) for that internal buffer (though I cannot 
think of any reason why I would want that internal buffer. Can you ?)
