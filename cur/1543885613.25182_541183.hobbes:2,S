In this case, since the number of blocks to preallocate (eg. N=10GB) is
clear, we could improve the current reservation code, to allow callers
explicitly ask for a new window that have the minimum N free blocks for
the blocks-to-preallocated(rather than just have at least 1 free
blocks).
Before the ext4_fallocate() is called, the right reservation window size
is set with the flag to indicating "please spend time if needed to find
a window covers at least N free blocks".
So for ex4 block mapped files, later when glibc is doing allocation and
zeroing, the ext4 block-mapped allocator will knows to reserve the right
amount of free blocks before allocating and zeroing 10GB space.
I am not sure whether this worth the effort though.
