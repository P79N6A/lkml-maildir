This can be because of another NIC being broken (or just crappy). Most
10Mbps HUBs cannot handle full duplex, and if you enable this anyway, you
get excessive collisions. Check that the other computer does not have full
duplex enabled.
To check if it's the HUB, you can always put a patch cable directly between
the two computers. This way you will get 100Mbps too, if both supports it.
A patch cable is wired in a different way than a standard cable, so be sure
to get the right kind.
