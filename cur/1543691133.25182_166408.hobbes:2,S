The nfsd/nfsctl.c one isn't actually a bug (though I had to think
about it a bit to be sure).
One of the "... DETELED 4 lines ..." is
		file->private_data = ar;
which takes a copy of "ar" into a structure that has a lifetime
greater than the function.
So when the "return -EFAULT" happends (at END -->), at is stored in
file->private_data, and a subsequent call to TA_release will free that
memory.
