I see type of behaviour this with an Orinoco Silver card while trying to
set the mode/essid.  I took the wvlan_cs code from my RH7.2 box and dropped
it into 2.5 - seems to work (although how reliable it is I don't know yet;
I need to get something for this card to talk to.)

Another difference that I noticed was that when no AP is in range, and the
ESSID has never been set, orinoco v0.07 reports "unspecified SSID!!!" as
the ESSID, as does wvlan_cs on the same RH7.2 kernel and with wvlan_cs on
2.5.44.  However, orinoco 0.13a reports an empty string.
Looking at the bytes read off the card, it seems that it returns a zero
length word, followed by the string "unspecified SSID!!!" with orinoco
0.13a.
Also, (iirc) I could make the card happier with the orinoco 0.13a driver
if I made it read excess bytes when reading the BAP (like wvlan_cs does.)
However, this didn't competely solve the problem - I still saw what I
think are firmware crashes.
