My system has found away to bridge distant areas of the universe in such 
a way that i am able to bypass the limitations of natural physics.
My computer can age days in a matter of seconds..
Example: It took me twelve days to download the quake3 demo i started
downloading yesterday, and began playing a half hour later.. compressed
time is funny like that.
The joystick module may hold a candle to all of this:  
Dec 16 18:23:09 fall kernel: js: Measured PIT speed is 43.268 MHz, but should be 1.193 MHz.
Dec 16 18:23:09 fall kernel: js: This is probably caused by wrong BogoMIPS value. It is: 333, should be: 1249.
Dec 16 18:23:09 fall kernel: js: Version 1.2.13 using 333 MHz RDTSC timer.
(btw: my system is a 333mhz celeron)
My uptime, date, usleep, and rtctest (included in
linux/Documentation/rtc.txt) all operate correctly.
Netscape will give me a javascript popup on my bank's website after a few
seconds telling me that my connection has gone idle for more than five
minutes and i will be disconnected.
XFree screen blanks whenever the mouse or keyboard is not in use (very
annoying).  
I think the following may be relevant:

I tried it a second time, and tar (or gzip?) locked up trying to
uncompress/unarchive. (can't even ctrl+c or ctrl+z it)
It is possible that the kernel source archive was corrupted since my
downloaded was continually interrupted because of how long lftp thought 
the download was taking.  But tar crashing? kernel bug? nah...
Any ideas?  $10 says this problem is already resolved and I am just a fool
for not having upgraded sooner. (i won't specify what currency the $10 is
in, needless to say, in real money it is worthless)
