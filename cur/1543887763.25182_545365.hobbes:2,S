Hello,
I have problem with PC card slot in Wyse 3360SE terminal. 
Card insertion or removal is detected, but nothing more. 
I tried two different cards. Same behaviour.
Hardware is:
> Intel ISA PCIC probe:
>   Intel i82365sl A step ISA-to-PCMCIA at port 0x3e0 ofs 0x00, 1 socket
>     host opts [0]: none
>     ISA irqs (default) = 3,4,5,7,9,10,11,12,14,15 polling interval = 1000 ms
Dmesg after inserting card:
> pccard: PCMCIA card inserted into slot 0
I have similar hardware in other machine:
>  Intel i82365sl B step ISA-to-PCMCIA at port 0x3e0 ofs 0x00, 2 sockets
>    host opts [0]: none
>    host opts [1]: none
>    ISA irqs (scanned) = 3,4,7,9,11,12 status change on irq 11
Which is working:
> pccard: PCMCIA card inserted into slot 0
> cs: memory probe 0x0d0000-0x0dffff: excluding 0xd0000-0xd1fff
> cs: memory probe 0x0e0000-0x0effff: clean.
> pcmcia: registering new device pcmcia0.0
I checked 82365 registers. Wyse has 0x82 at offset 0 and 0 at 
offset 6. In working case it is 0x83 at offset 0 and 1 at offset 6. 
Next differences at and above 0x10 offset.
I tried all "pccardctl" options. No change. Please point me direction 
in which I should search for solution. I don't know if it is important: 
after reboot 82365 isn't detected at all on Wyse.
Please CC me.
Thank You
Rafał
