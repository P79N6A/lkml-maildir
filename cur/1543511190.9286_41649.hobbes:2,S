This MIGHT be off-topic for the kernel list.
what would it take to get a proprietary USB device supported in the
kernel? Is it the same procedure as a normal device driver?
I have a toshiba infinia computer with this USB module on the monitor that
controls TV tuner, phone, answering machine, etc..has an infra-red port
too for interface to a remote control.
I'm assuming this would be considered proprietary? or maybe fall under the
HID class of devices??
