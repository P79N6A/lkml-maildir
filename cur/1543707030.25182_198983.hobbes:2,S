modutils <= 2.4 was never designed to run in cross compile mode.  The
modules.dep file created at compile time is a courtesy file, in an
attempt to avoid warning messages (no modules.dep) on the very first
boot of a new kernel version.  Once the kernel has been booted, it ahs
its own modules.dep.
Making it run on the target system but handle cross compiled modules
pulls in all the problems associated with build and target having
different word sizes, different endianess and different object
information.  modutils 2.4 is now in stable mode, it is only taking bug
fixes.  A complete rewrite to handle cross compile is not a bug fix.
Bottom line: when building cross compile use make ... DEPMOD=/bin/true
to avoid using the local depmod.
