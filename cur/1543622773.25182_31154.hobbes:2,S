With 19-pre1-ac1 on a reiserfs partition I cannot patch a kernel. Patch
fails with "Invalid cross-device link" or "Out of disk space".
The partition has around 350 Mb free space (and has plenty of inodes
because it held linux sources + jboss + other sources that I removed).
How to reproduce:
   bunzip2 -c linux-2.4.17.tar.bz2 | tar xf -
   bunzip2 -c patch-2.4.18.bz2 | patch -p0
18-rc2-ac1 works fine on the same partition.
