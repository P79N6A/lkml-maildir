2.6.16-git9 is better, but still fails on this defconfig.  We now
have:
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
kernel/built-in.o:(.data+0xd1c): undefined reference to `uevent_helper'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
make: Leaving directory `/var/tmp/kernel-orig'
which seems to be a reference from sysfs.c for ...proc.../sys/kernel/hotplug.
This brings up an interesting point - if CONFIG_NET is not set and
CONFIG_HOTPLUG is set, don't we want to call /sbin/hotplug?  If
...proc.../sys/kernel/hotplug isn't present then what?
Or are we back in the business of breaking the userspace expectations
in random ways?
