No, it isn't.  OTOH, udev maintains it, so I guess that's good enough.
It makes udev the kernel interface though.  I hope they now care about
compatibility (/dev/.udev.pdb vs. /dev/.udev/db/* anyone?).

Bullshit.  If <x> is the only interface available to a kernel service,
then <x> is part of the kernel whether you like it or not.  Case in
point, the ALSA library.
