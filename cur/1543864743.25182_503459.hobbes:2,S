It really beats the alternative of a forced reboot
due to, say, superblock I/O failing because it happened
to get merged with an unrelated I/O which then failed..
Etc..
Definitely an improvement.
The number of retries is an entirely separate issue.
If we really care about it, then we should fix SD_MAX_RETRIES.
The current value of 5 is *way* too high.  It should be zero or one.
Cheers
