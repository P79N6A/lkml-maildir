Hey all. I just thought of something for this. I have an older Western
Caviar 36400 hard drive that disconnects once the computer goes to
sleep.  Currently, I disallow sleep mode for that very reason. But
anyway,  I'm curious if it's safe to do a reset of  the IDE controller. 
In my case, the drive is currently on primary slave. I moved it from
secondary master.   
Right now, I fear if I hard-reset the IDE controller (a Via 686
UDMA100), I might also disconnect the primary master (Quantum fireball
6.4SE). That will render my box useless until I hit the the reset
button.  But, if I do a soft-reset, the caviar may not wake up. I know
the quantum will wake up fine upon a soft-reset and upon resume of the
system.  I'm going to try putting in interrupt 15 (secondary IDE) as a
primary power event in my bios and see if that can wake up the drive.
Oh, if you're curious, here is my fstab:
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.

/dev/hdb1	/win2k-driveE	ntfs	defaults,ro,user,uid=cappicard	0	0
As you probably see, if my caviar (hdb) disconnects, I'm pretty-much SOL
if  I try to run X or any programs from /usr/*. And I have to resort to
SysRq to reboot the box (I hate finding a pen to hit the reset button). 
I'll let you know what I find out.
