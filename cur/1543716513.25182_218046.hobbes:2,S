oopses in driver, oopses by triggering BUG() or oopses in fs/*?  The last
two would be more interesting - isofs _MUST_ be able to survive any IO
errors, simply because CDs get scratched, etc. and that shouldn't crash
the box.

Free advice: if you want to handle that one, fork off the bits you really
need.  Keeping the drivers for all variants together simply doesn't pay,
and even the excuse of keeping the development in single codebase doesn't
apply anymore for what, 7 years?
