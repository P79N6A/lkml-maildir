Hello,
first of all I apologize for posting here (I have tried many times
to susbribe to video4linux (with email gregoire.favre@urbanet.ch)
without success...).
I have a Miro PCTV (Pro) and I was using bttv as module, but as from
2.2.1-ac4 it works in the kernel, I put it in the kernel (from dmesg):
Sound initialization started
<Sound Blaster 16 (4.13)> at 0x220 irq 5 dma 1,5
<Sound Blaster 16> at 0x330 irq 5 dma 0
<Yamaha OPL3> at 0x388
Sound initialization complete
i2c: initialized
Linux video capture interface: v1.00
bttv0: Brooktree Bt848 (rev 18) bus: 0, devfn: 80, irq: 11, memory: 0xe1000000.
PCI: Increasing latency timer of device 00:50 to 64
bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found.
bttv0: model: BT848(Miro pro)
msp3400: init: chip=MSP3410C-E27, has NICAM support
SAA5249 driver (SAA5249 interface) for VideoText version 1.7
And here is my question:
I can start xawtv, set the right channel, quit xawtv and alevt, and it works,
not with all channels and very very slowly...
And if I don't quit xawtv, I got:alevt: # /dev/vbi: Device or resource busy
Is there a special device for SAA5249?
I was unable to compile videotext-0.6.971023...
Does it mean that there is no need for the SAA5249 (and I am not sure to have
one...) and that it's not possible to look at a channel while reading teletext
(like under Windows...)?
Thanks for your help,
	Greg				mailto:greg@imaux.unil.ch
