Is EEH a PCI-SIG specification? Is EEH specs available in public?

It seems that a PCI-PCI bridge per slot is hardware implementation
specific. The fact that the PCI-PCI Bridge can isolate the slot is
hardware feature specific.

PCI Express AER driver uses similar concept of determining whether the
driver is AER-aware or not except that PCI Express AER is independent
from firmware support.

Where does the platform code reside and where does it log the error?
In PCI Express if the driver is not AER-aware the fatal error message is
reported by its upstream switch, the AER driver obtains comprehensive
error information from the upstream switch (like EEH platform code
obtains error information from the firmware). Since the driver is not
AER-aware, the fatal error is reported to user to make a policy decision
since the PCI Express does not have a hot-plug event for the slot like
EEH platform. 
So it looks like the hot-plug capability of the driver is being used in
lieu of specific callbacks to freeze and thaw IO in the case of a
non-aware driver.  If the driver does not support hot-plug then the
error is just logged.  Do you leave the slot isolated or perform error
recovery anyway?
On a fatal error the interface is down.  No matter what the driver
supports (AER aware, EEH aware, unaware) all IO is likely to fail.
Resetting a bus in a point-to-point environment like PCI Express or EEH
(as you describe) should have little adverse effect.  The risk is the
bus reset will cause a card reset and the driver must understand to
re-initialize the card.  A link reset in PCI Express will not cause a
card reset.  We assume the driver will reset its card if necessary.

In PCI Express the AER driver obtains fatal error information from the
upstream switch driver. We can use the same API with message =
PCIERR_ERROR_RECOVER to notify the endpoint driver, which is maybe
unaware of the fatal error reported by its upstream device. Mostly the
driver will respond with PCIERR_RESULT_NEED_RESET.

Yes the same case applies to PCI Express upstream links.  So halting IO
is desired when other devices are affected.
