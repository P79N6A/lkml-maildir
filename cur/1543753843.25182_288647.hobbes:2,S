OK, but that certainly shouldn't preclude read access.  The way it is 
now, you can't even list append-only directories.  It seems like this 
check should treat append-only files as read-only, only failing to open 
them if write access is requested, rather than failing all the time like 
it does now.
In this particular case, I'm not using append-only files, but rather 
using immutable files and append-only directories to create an archival 
space where things can be added but not changed.  Even if the protocol 
can't deal with append-only regular files, isn't it possible to allow 
mkdir but not rmdir?
