K&R calls them 'members'. 
We've currently got:
sizeof (built-in)
typeof (built-in)
offsetof (standard macro)
container_of (kernel macro) (1800 of these, ugh)
We don't want:
FIELD_SIZE - they're members
MEMBER_SIZE - inconsistent with the above
member_size - all the above have of
member_size_of - inconsistent with sizeof
member_sizeof - inconsistent _ between words
sizeof_member - same, plus other issues
memsizeof - confusion with memory
So my vote would be for:
membersizeof(a, b)
There's also at least two pieces of code that could use:
membertypeof(a, b)
And please kill all the reimplementations of offsetof while you're at it.
