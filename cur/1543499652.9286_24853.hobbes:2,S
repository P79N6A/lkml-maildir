To avoid this problem, I religiously partition fresh factory
drives on a primary master or primary slave *always*.  You only
need to make one partition.  Then the drive can be moved to the
secondary without worry.
If you don't have a free primary, and cannot remove one of the
primary drives to do this, you can either shut the machine down
and boot off a boot floppy containing fdisk, after removing a
primary drive, and replacing it with the one you wish to
partition, or you can use a different computer to do the
partitioning.
It is a good workaround.
