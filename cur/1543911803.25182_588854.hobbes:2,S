Hi,
on request of the people working on 
http://jp.kernelnewbies.org/
I have set up a Japanese language kernelnewbies mailing list:
http://lists.kernelnewbies.org/mailman/listinfo/jp-kernelnewbies
I am sending this out via the general list since obviously the
Japanese developers are not on this new list yet :)
Hopefully having Japanese language resources available will make it
easier for Japanese developers to get started in Linux development.
