Subject: [PATCH] fix UFS superblock alignment issues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

ufs2 fails to mount on x86_64, claiming bad magic.  This is because 
ufs_super_block_third's fs_un1 member is padded out by 4 bytes for
8-byte alignment, pushing down the rest of the struct.
Forcing this to be packed solves it.  I took a quick look over
other on-disk structures and didn't immediately find other problems.
I was able to mount & ls a populated ufs2 filesystem w/ this change.
Thanks,
-Eric
