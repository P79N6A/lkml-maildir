 What do you mean?  If used in an option card, you may want some of the
device's internal address space to be accessible from your host somehow,
e.g. as a way of interfacing the device's firmware, so you need a BAR to
map it somewhere in the PCI address space.

 And BTW, we fix it up for the 82375 as a quirk, by substituting the
"right" class code.  It can be done for others if there's a need.
