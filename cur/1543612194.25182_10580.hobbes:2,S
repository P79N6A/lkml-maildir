Hi all!
Due to a f**ked power shortage (no UPS yet) our server had to reboot:
Hardware:
model name      : AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor
stepping        : 0
cpu MHz         : 350.814
RAM: 128 MB
Aladin5 based Asus board. IDE interface: Acer Laboratories Inc. [ALi] M5229 IDE
(rev 193) and an additional:  Promise Technology, Inc. 20268 (rev 2).
There where 1 (for /) and 3 software RAID 5 IBM-DTLA-305040 each as master
on a single channel connected all using ReiserFS.
The system freezed (no oops - simply freeze) reproduceable during a ReiseFS
check of the / partiotion. (So it doens't even come to the /home md0 one).
I even booted a recsue disc mounted the / (so the transaction-log is clean),
and rebooted. Then it freezes at an ramdon point during the init.d scripts.
I fixed it by removing one IBM disc from the on-board IDE chip's
second channel and adding it to the promisse as slave. Now it works?
The server ran stable for 17 days using a 2.4.14 kernel and using the
2.4.16 since it got out ... I do not know what might be wrong, IDE code,
ALi M5229 IDE code, RAID code (or ReierFS)? - I do not expet it to be fixed
from this lousy bug-report - only that you heared that there might be a problem
somehere in this areas ...
(Oh. I do not like to try this again with our data - and we will have a
UPS in some days ;-) - AND I will never use IDE crapp again :-((( )
Much thanks!
  René
