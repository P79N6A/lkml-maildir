[ BTW, this is the last time I'll try explaining this to you. ]
The one-line patch you're suggesting *would*not*allow* one to use the async
scanning _at_all_. If one really wants to use async scanning reliably (even in
the future, as it can be turned on at boot-time later, like you very well know),
that module *must* be built. Making it user-visible and/or optional would *not*
be a solution but a *problem*. What I have been suggesting is *not* to make
this *dummy module* user-visible and/or optional but to _not_ use this
*dummy module* for this purpose in the first place.

[ This time, I don't see the subject changing, nor a "change in the general
direction of the thread blah blah blah", and still you feel compelled to not
maintain the CC list. Wow. ]
