IBM should rather lobby to mend patent laws to exempt Linux, not the other
way around :)
the generic idea would be to create positive discrimination laws for free
software: to make new laws to protect free software, acknowledging the
fact that free software is in the public interest, thus free software
deserves extra protection like academic research does: eg. patent law does
not apply... (time to call your congressman, it's easy :)
