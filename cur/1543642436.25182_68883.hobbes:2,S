Because it's also needed for non-CLONE_DETACH processes.  I added it
earlier down by the release_task, remember?  I deleted it in this patch
originally, and the change got lost somewhere; my intent is to check
for this only in release_task and nowhere else.  When I have a clear
point to resync with Linus again then I'll make sure this is right.

Oh - when the tracer exits the original parent may be corrupted, you
mean?  I guess you're right.  But I've made so many changes to this bit
of code that I'd like to wait until it settles before we fix this -
it's not a new problem.

I don't understand what you mean.

I should've caught that, I actually use the ptrace flags here.  But the
code that uses them is suffering some other BUG() right now.

Right on both counts; how's this look (on top of the last patch):
