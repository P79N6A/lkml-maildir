Just to be clear, we're talking about this fix:
+	if (scsi_id->workarounds & SBP2_WORKAROUND_FIX_CAPACITY)
+		sdev->fix_capacity = 1;
with patches 1 and 2 consolidating workaround logic, and 4 adding the
command line override.
I'd feel better to let this bit diverge in -stable to have the two-line
patch rather than all 4 patches.  Could you do detection sbp2_probe(),
set a flag in scsi_id_instance_data, and use that in slave_configure?
thanks,
-chris
