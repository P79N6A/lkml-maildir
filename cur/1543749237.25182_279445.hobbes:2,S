Hello,
Here is a patchset to fix a bug of m32r kernel 2.6.9 that a code on
a noexec page can be executed incorrectly.
For good security, stack region should be non-executable. 
This fix is also needed to achieve non-executable stack.
Please apply this to 2.6.10 kernel if possible.
Thank you.

  instead of encoding it into address parameter.
