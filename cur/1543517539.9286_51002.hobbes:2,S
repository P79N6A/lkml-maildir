I seem to be getting these errors while attempting to copy a CD that I Burned
recently and was wondering what the errors exactly meant, and if there was
anyway to get around them.  I've tried the cd on several machines now, and I
know it is the CD that is bad and not the drive.
While copying the entire CD I get the Following Errors: 
----------------
hdb: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: cdrom_decode_status: error=0x30
hdb: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: cdrom_decode_status: error=0x30
hdb: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: cdrom_decode_status: error=0x30
hdb: cdrom_decode_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdb: cdrom_decode_status: error=0x30
hdb: ATAPI reset complete
end_request: I/O error, dev 03:40 (hdb), sector 974320
ATAPI device hdb:
  Error: Unit attention -- (Sense key=0x06)
  Power on, reset or bus device reset occurred -- (asc=0x29, ascq=0x00)
----------------
These errors will repeat indefinately. The "hdb: cdrom_decode..." errors seem
to be the most popular (about 4-5 status/error messages to every "ATAPI reset"
and corresponding errors).
I still seem to be able to copy various different parts of the CD, but a lot of
the CD seems to be bad.
Any Help would be appreciated.
