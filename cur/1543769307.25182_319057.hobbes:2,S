I suggest you visit our project, see the testing result,
http://developer.osdl.jp/projects/doubt/fs-consistency-and-coherency
For each test case, different FS returns different result.

standard which constraints the error type. Otherwise, different fs
can return whatever they want, regardless of the user's need.
