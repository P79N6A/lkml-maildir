Andrea,
since you ask...
I consider myself a not very typical Linux user in that I am a 
programmer too and I (sometimes) write programs for Linux as well. And 
yes, I do compile my own kernels.
I think it is pretty senseless to have a configuation option for the 
default size of that buffer. Especially if I can, in one of the first rc 
scripts, do something like 'echo 128 > /proc/sys/kernel/printkbuffer'.
The only hard requirement for that default size is that all output up 
till that rc script fits into a buffer of that size.
And yes, I do care about that static 64K buffer. I still have an old 
pentium that only has 16M. Every byte counts!
On the other hand there are the really large systems with many CPUs and 
such. Those might have problems with the small default. But, well, those 
really could #ifdef a different default based on some configuration 
options...
