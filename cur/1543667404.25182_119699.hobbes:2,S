Martin,
Thank you for your message and patch which I tested. Firstlye some more background info.
I just started testing 2.5 on all kinds of hw.  This is being done on RH beta 8.094 (phoebe)
This machine is an old 586 w/o ACPI and bootet with acpi=off. I sent messages  and dmesg to your email only.
1) 2.5.65 + acpi20030321, isapnp fails on the _first_ attempt and works on the second and further(rmmod ne and 8390) attempts. There is a kernel message during ifup which may give you a hint
1st attempt:
 kernel: pnp: res: The PnP device '01:01.00' is already active.
 kernel: ne.c: You must supply "io=0xNNN" value(s) for ISA cards.
 ifup: ne device eth0 does not seem to be present, delaying initialization.
 network: Bringing up interface eth0:  failed
2nd (and further after rmmod) attempt:
 kernel: ne.c:v1.10 9/23/94 Donald Becker (becker@scyld.com)
 kernel: Last modified Nov 1, 2000 by Paul Gortmaker
 kernel: NE*000 ethercard probe at 0x2a0: 00 00 ff ff 27 ef
 kernel: eth0: NE2000 found at 0x2a0, using IRQ 15.
 network: Bringing up interface eth0:  succeeded
2) 2.5.65 + acpi20030321 + your patch, pnp does not work at all, but the module can be inserted with modprobe ne io=0x2a0 irq=15. It seems it does not talk to the ne code as Beckers msg missing?
All attempts of ifup eth0 or service network start:
ifup: Cannot find device "eth0"
network: Bringing up loopback interface:  succeeded
kernel: ne.c: You must supply "io=0xNNN" value(s) for ISA cards.
ifup: ne device eth0 does not seem to be present, delaying initialization.
network: Bringing up interface eth0:  failed
modprobe ne io=0x2a0 irq=15:

for me not yet ... :-)
