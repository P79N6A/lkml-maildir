It could be a matter of timing. Some badly designed USB devices have a
dead time between power-up and being ready, but show up on the bus as
if they where. The "Media not present" thing could be a symptom of this.
To verify it, try inserting the device slowly. The power contacts in
the USB connector are longer than the data contacts and the device gets
more time to boot.
