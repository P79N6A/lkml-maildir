Yes.

No.

My guess is that the slab allocator solves this, but I don't know that
much about the MM.

Have a look in include/linux/list.h.
Or install jadetex and the DocBook style sheets and type "make psdocs"
in the kernel tree. That will create the file
Documentation/DocBook/kernel-api.ps in which the linked list API (and
much more) is described.
