Several people reported this problem in 2.5.45.
I don't know how tough it is to check all combinations of config
options for such build problems, and I don't know how much code
and/or options there are in linux/net/ compared to linux/drivers/usb/,
but when I was the USB maintainer, before sending patches to Linus,
I would	use a script to build all of USB in-kernel and then build all
of USB as loadable modules.  This helped me make sure that easy-to-catch
problems didn't happen.
just an idea...

(OK, net/ is about double the size of usb/)
