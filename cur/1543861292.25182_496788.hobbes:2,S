Just a warning. I'm seeing data corruption on this system. I need to try and narrow it down, but on 
transferring 100 files totalling about 80GB from a USB drive to the drives on this controller I'm 
seeing repeatable and apparently random corruption on the data reaching the disks. I don't recall 
seeing this when I used SIL controllers in place of the HPT but I now have an easily repeatable test 
case so I'll keep testing until I peg it.
