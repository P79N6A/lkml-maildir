Yeah, of course. It's actually in the 'plug' branch of the block repo
(and has been for some weeks), so it's public. I'll post the updated
patch soon again.

Yes,

There might, there might not be. Currently it replugs the queue to
prevent a livelock if the same process currently holds a read_lock on
the queue. And I guess that will stay, so that's a yes here as well.

I could not convince myself that it wasn't always needed, so I'd agree.
