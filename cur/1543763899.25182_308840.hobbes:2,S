No, that wouldn't work.  I am saying that there's little to gain by
adding all this complexity for destroying the idle tasks when it's
fairly simple to create num_possible_cpus() - 1 idle tasks* to
accommodate any additional cpus which may come along.  This is what
ppc64 does now, and it should be feasible on any architecture which
supports cpu hotplug.

* num_possible_cpus() - 1 because the idle task for the boot cpu is
  created in sched_init.
