Forgive my typo. The KP error was "Kernel panic: BRKADRINT" and is 
located in the Adaptec aic7xxx/aic79xx driver sources.
Now I just have to figure out why it is occurring. The motherboards have 
Adaptec 7902W onboard, attached to a separate PCI-X bus from the 
Infiniband HCA.
Apologies for the confusion
