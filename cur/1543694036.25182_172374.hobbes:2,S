Depending on the particulars of your distribution, you might need to

Subject: [INFO] gcc versions used to compile a kernel
The last days I had a lot of trouble getting different kernel 
versions to run. Enclosed is a short report of the experience I made.
First I tried to compile all kernels with gcc 3.3.1.
2.4.20 I even couldn't compile.
2.4.22-ac4 compiled well but oopsed immediately after booting.
2.6.0-test4 and test5 compiled well but didn't boot and froze with a 
blank screen.
2.6.0-test6 compiled well but froze after starting /sbin/init.
Then I used gcc 2.95.3 for compiling 2.4.20, 2.4.22-ac4 and 2.6.0-
test7 and all kernels booted smoothly.
It's seems that at least in my configuration gcc 3.3.1 is doing a bad 
job.
Mit freundlichen Gruessen/Best regards,
Sebastian Piecha
