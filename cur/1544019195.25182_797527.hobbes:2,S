The capacity is automatically set to the amount of VRAM out there, based 
on what the PCI subsystem says the resource length is. So if you mount 
your ATI Radeon's VRAM and it has 512MB on it, you'll get a filesystem 
with a capacity of 512MB.
Fdisk is not necessary, the filesystem structures are maintained in 
system memory not VRAM. Like tmpfs/shmemfs the filesystem structures are 
discarded on unmount, though the contents are not cleared from VRAM.
Adding a mount parameter to override the PCI system reported length 
wouldn't be hard either.
