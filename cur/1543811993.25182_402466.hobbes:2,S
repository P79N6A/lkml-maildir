Without the FIXME actually "fixed", this does not make sense. You want to
match always on _all_ aliases. In most cases where you have more than
one, the first one is the vendor specific one which isn't interesting at
all on Linux. If you have more than one entry usually the second one is the
one you are looking for.
So eighter we find a way to encode _all_ id's in one modalias string which can
be matched by a wildcard or keep the current solution which iterates over the
sysfs "id" file and calls modprobe for every entry.
Thanks,
Kay
