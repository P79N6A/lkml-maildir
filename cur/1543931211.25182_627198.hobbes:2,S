I think this just leaves us with deciding on a mechanism for how to do
single-application quirks.  I take Andi's point that adding a flag set to the
quirk data structure is a fine solution, but I'm really ok with static integers
in individual functions.  Do we have consensus on how to handle that?  I'm happy
either way, but I'd rather have agreement on how to handle it before I post
another iteration of this patch.  
Thanks & Regards
