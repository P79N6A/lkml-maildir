In most (all?) cases, the code checks a field that the module fills in.
This field indicates not only that the module was loaded but that it
did its work.  Like this code from drivers/block/md.c.
  if (!pers[pnum]) {
    request_module("md-personality-%d", pnum);
    if (!pers[pnum])
       return -EINVAL;
  }
