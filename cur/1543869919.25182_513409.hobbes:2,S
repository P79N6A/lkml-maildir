Davide,
This is really cool, because the size of epitem would fit now in 128 bytes 
instead of 192 (on x86_64 platforms). So we also reduce memory usage.
I have one comment :

Now that we scan the rdllist list once, it may be usefull to use a prefetch() 
hint. 
list_for_each() has one prefetch(pos->next) automatically included, but not 
your open coded loop.
I suggest adding after epi = list_entry(txlist->next, struct epitem, rdllink);
prefetch(epi->rdllink.next);
Thank you
