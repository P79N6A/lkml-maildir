Subject: [PATCH 6/7] kbuild: add objectify
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/10/145

Use foo := $(call objectify, $(foo)) to prefix $(foo) with $(obj)/ unless
$(foo) is an absolute path.
For now no in-tree users - soon to come.
