Andrew,
I was hoping to get your input on how to handle patches that cross  
maintainers.  I've got a patch that is pretty PPC specific, but  
happens to touch some drivers as well.
Here's the diffstat to get a rough idea:
arch/powerpc/kernel/io.c                |   12 ++++++------
arch/powerpc/mm/hash_native_64.c        |    2 +-
arch/powerpc/mm/stab.c                  |    4 ++--
drivers/ide/pci/scc_pata.c              |    4 ++--
drivers/media/dvb/bt8xx/bt878.h         |    5 ++---
drivers/serial/cpm_uart/cpm_uart_core.c |    2 +-
include/asm-powerpc/system.h            |    2 +-
7 files changed, 15 insertions(+), 16 deletions(-)
Now, I've had this issue before w/o any good sense on how to handle it.
Suggestions?
