Too far apart? Once a retransmit succeeds TCP will go into regular
slow start again and the retransmit backoff is reset.

You should be able to continue the session all the time, assuming it
wasn't disconnected longer than the TCP hard time out.
I was actually bored and implemented KA9Q style kick. Just apply this
patch to 2.2.13 (should apply to most 2.2,2.3 kernels too) and the 
ssh patch to ssh-1.2.27. The kernel patch adds a new setsockopt
TCP_KICK that causes an immediate retransmit, without messing with
the timeouts or the congestion window. When the other end answers
TCP will go into slow start normally and recover.
The ssh patch adds a new escape ~k that calls TCP_KICK on the socket.
It would be also useful if that could be forced for all sockets
that use a particular device (e.g. triggered by pppd on reconnect).
That also wouldn't be very hard to implement, it is a variation of
the existing IFF_DYNAMIC patch, but not tonight.
Problem is that it circumvents the TCP congestion avoidance algorithms, 
so a rogue application calling TCP_KICK in a tight loop could flood the
network (but it could do that anyways with a UDP socket, so it isn't
that bad)
The kernel patch is very simple, because fast path mtu discovery already
needed a way to force retransmits.
Only lightly tested, but seems to work here.  Maybe it is helpful
for someone.
