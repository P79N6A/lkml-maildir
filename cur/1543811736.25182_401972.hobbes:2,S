Except
- There's (presently) no way of making all the messages go away for a
  non-debug build.
- The code is structured as
	if (ata_msg_foo(p))
		printk("something");
  So if we later do
	#define ata_msg_foo(p)	0
  We'll still get copies of "something" in the kernel image (may be fixed
  in later gcc, dunno).
- The new debug stuff isn't documented.  One has funble around in the
  source to work out how to even turn it on.  Can it be altered at runtime?
  Dunno - the changelogs are risible.  What effect do the various flags
  have?
  Having spent (and re-spent) time grovelling through the ALSA source
  working out how to enable their debug stuff during a maintainer snooze
  I'd prefer we didn't have to do that with libata as well.
