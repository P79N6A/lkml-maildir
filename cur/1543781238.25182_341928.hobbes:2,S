Hi,
I continue studying the VFS interface. As I said in previous e-mails,
my goal is to integrate an existing parallel filesystem into the Linux
kernel.
Now, I am looking for a reduced subset of operations to focus on. I
have selected the following:
  struct file_system_type
    get_sb()
  struct super_operations
    read_inode()
    write_inode()
    delete_inode()
    write_super()
  struct inode_operations
    *none*
  struct dentry_operations
    *none*
  struct file_operations
    read()
    write()
Methods that are not in the listing will be replaced by generic
functions. I think that the enumerated methods are what it is needed
to make this network based filesystem work (without taking in account
other requirements of the filesystem).
I would appreciate corrections about this listing in case I have
forget some important method.
Regards,
