Most of the extended attribute systems I have seen have been a set of 
flags.  "If this bit is set, the user can do thus to this object." 
Sometimes it is a named attribute that is attached to the object.
Forks tend to be "this blob of data is attached to this object".
With forks, the choices tend to be a lot more arbitrary.
