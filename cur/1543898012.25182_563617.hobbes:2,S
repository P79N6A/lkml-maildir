With  a properly coded ALSA app, one doesn't need a .asoundrc. You would 
enter "plug:spdif" [or something similar] into the pcm device name entry text 
field.
Or if you want to point all apps to that device you actually could add this to 
your .asoundrc:
pcm.!default {
	type plug
	slace.pcm "spdif"
}
[or something similar. Too lazy to look up the exact syntax now]. And then 
every app using the ALSA API _correctly_ should use that device [if 
configured to use the default device, which should be the _default_ ;)]
Sadly it seems pretty much everyone, especially closed source apps get this 
wrong (but to be fair: loads of open source software gets it wrong, too, 
ekiga for example).
What they do wrong is that they try to present a list of devices to the user 
from which he can choose [which isn't bad in itself] and also do _not_ offer 
any way to specify an arbitrary PCM device name.
Sadly, the ALSA api docs do not stress this point often enough, so it gets 
missed pretty often.
I once posted an [not original, i suppose people before me got that idea, too] 
idea to the alsa-dev list a while back, proposing a way to be able 
to "register" pcm devices defined in .asoundrc/asound.conf, so that apps that 
want to present a list to the user can simply ask ALSA for a list of devices 
nd hav the user defined ones included. Sadly i don't think it ever went 
anywhere..

Well, like i said, the application in question should allow you to enter any 
pcm name you want. If it doesn't it's broken.

I own a ice1712, too, but i only use it for JACK and it works brilliantly 
there. But i know it can be a bitch to configure since it sports a 10/12 
channel device which can be too complicated for some ALSA apps making 
assumptions about the device they get ;)

I don't know of any. But any text editor will do.

The flashplayer has been another one of these badly coded apps ;) Maybe that 
has changed in recent releases.

But skype is a piece of crap anyways. It also doesn't get any sounds out of my 
other [non ice1712] card. Neither in OSS nor in ALSA mode. Not a beep. And 
yeah, the device is available [and even has hardware multiplexing]..

I agree. ALSA is not very userfriendly. Especially the missing proper device 
enumeration support is a problem.
But 99.9% of problems people have with ALSA are due to badly coded apps..
