Andreas's patch is a bit sneaky: it simply sets ->h_sync on the current
transaction then does journal_stop().  I think your patch can do the same
thing?
again:
	handle = ext3_journal_start(...);
	...
	if (err == -ENOSPC && ext3_should_retry_alloc(inode, handle, &retry)) {
		goto again;
	} else {
		err2 = ext3_journal_stop(handle);
		if (!err)
			err = err2;
	}
	return err;
Something like that.
