A change was made to ide-disk.c where it _always_ attempts to do
a READ_NATIVE_MAX call regardless of whether the drive supports
the host protected area feature set in the
init_idedisk_capacity() function.  I submitted a patch to address
this, which is currently being reworked a bit in the 2.6 kernel 
tree and will then be backported again to 2.4.
