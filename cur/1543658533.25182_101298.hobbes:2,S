I was able to reproduce the problem again. I have been using ethereal to
sniff instead of tcpdump and gave out some more info.
basically the icecast server at certain time (but i can't predict
exactly in which situations) just send a FIN, ACK packet to the client.
Basically to close the connection and after a few packets the client of
course answer.What is strange that in the meanwhile there are still 3/4
data packets coming from the server to the client.
Regarding the network side I noticed the following:
an average of 500ms to ping6 the server and 0 pkt loss
few seconds before the FIN, ACK (server->client) and for about 6 pkts the
average jumped to 2000ms
I suspect that this network flap made the server thinking about
<insert_here_whatever_term_is_more_appropriate> and decided to close
the connection.
The full ethereal dump is available at
http://www.fabbione.net/ice-xmms-ipv6.dump.bz2
but PLEASE note that it is a 10MB file and Im on a slow adsl line so be
"nice".
Fabio
PS Im afraid/happy that anyway the problem is not related to the kernel
version we are running.
