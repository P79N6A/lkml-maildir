Renato,
I don't understand how your Toshiba is similar to Knut's Aopen.
You've got a single critical trip point at 105C, but no active or passive
trip points.
Are you reporting some kind of failure?
The only thing wrong with your system is that polling_frequency != 0 --
but that is probably a distro configuration issue rather than
a kernel issue.
thanks,
