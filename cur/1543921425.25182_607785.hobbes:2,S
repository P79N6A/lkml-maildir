This just breaks coherency again like the last patch. That's a
really bad idea especially for stable (even if nothing actually
was to break, we'd likely never know about it anyway).
Christian's patch should go upstream and into stable. For 2.6.25-6,
my rewrite should just replace what's there. Using address spaces
to hold the ramdisk pages just confuses the issue even if they
*aren't* actually wired up to the vfs at all. Saving 20 lines is
not a good reason to use them.
