The patch only affects CDROMREADAUDIO ioctl. cdda2wav (with recent
libscg) will use SG_IO, which works equally well already. cdparanoia
uses CDROMREADAUDIO as well iirc, if it can use /dev/sg* sg v2
interface. I'm not completely sure, if you send me an strace of the
process in question I can tell you for sure :)
