I guess it wasn't using that descriptor. The machine behaved the same way
as before when I tested each patch ("unable to enter requested state", and
system comes back to normal).
While experimenting, I noticed something else: in the cases where a system
suspend failed ('apm -s', closing the lid, or activating IBM's hibernate
mode), a 'system standby' request worked. Trying to transition from
standby to suspend does not work, however-- the laptop wakes up, and
eventually prints the same error message as for a normal suspend.
thanks for the patch,
