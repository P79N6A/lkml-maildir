I'd submitted these patches a while back. Andrew observed that the
problems they fixed did not manifest in file-backed loops, so his
solution (which was merged into -mm but not mainstream) was to cut out
the block-backed code path entirely. THAT is what breaks journaling
filesystems on loops (note: not vice versa).

There's no need to allocate memory for a second copy of the data on
a read. This is a performance improvenment but I'd say it's closely
related to the main point of the patch (i.e. take what pages you can get
and recycle them); I'm making the block-backed code path significantly
more complex and at the same time having reads take a shortcut. But I
could split that into a separate patch if desired.
