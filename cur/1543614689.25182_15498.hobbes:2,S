Subject: [RFC][PATCH] unchecked request_region's in drivers/net
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

drivers/sound is another tree in desperate need of
check_region/request_region cleanup. I'll try cover it and send to
the respective maintainers... Although i reckon the hit/miss ratio will be
a tad on the miss side ;)
