I think it's a valid assumption, if we say that the author
of the patch read the license header of a file and agreed with it.
So the patch is licensed to whatever the fileheader says. And if
there's none, it's licensed with the COPYING terms.
If a patch author likes some other license conditions, he must
explicitely add them with the patch to the file, saying that this
and that part have these and those conditions. Of course they must
be compatible with the original license.
