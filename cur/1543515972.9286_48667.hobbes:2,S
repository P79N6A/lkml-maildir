this patch fixes the problem that i emailed the list a couple
of days ago about.
when i tried to insmod dmasound.o it gave me the following error:
dmasound.o: unresolved symbol machine_is_compatible
i assumed it was because machine_is_compatible was not exported
in the kernel symbol table
the following one line patch fixes the problem, it's against 2.2.13
