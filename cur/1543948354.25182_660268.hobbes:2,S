Hi Nikola,
Please put support@areca.com.tw in the loop.
I am sure Areca support, Kevin, has taken over your case.
If you like, please let him know your configuration and operations to
synchronize both sides.
Thank you for your patience and sorry for your inconvenience,

Maybe memory fragmentation?  Perhaps the driver tries to allocate a
large block of memory and cannot find a continuous block of the right
size.
Maybe the driver developers used different kernel .config options than
you are using.  
Try increasing the value in /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes.
Try switching some things like SLAB or SLUB, try booting with
kernelcore=512M to enable the Movable memory zone, or try 64-bit vs
32-bit kernels.
