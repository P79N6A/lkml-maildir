Ok, we can read()/write() structures.  So someone invents the following
structure:
	struct foo {
		int cmd;
		void *data;
	} foo;
Now they use write(fd, &foo, sizeof(foo)); Haven't they just swapped
the ioctl() interface for write() instead?
Ok, lets hope that humanity isn't that stupid, so lets take another
example:
	struct bar {
		int in_size;
		void *in_data;
		int out_size;
		void *out_data;
	};
	struct foo {
		int cmd;
		struct bar1;
	} foo;
Same write call, but ok, we have a structure of known size.  Its still
the same problem.
What I'm trying to say is that I think that read+write is open to more
or the same abuse that ioctl has been, not less.
However, it does have one good thing going for it - you can support
poll on blocking "ioctls" like TIOCMIWAIT.

I still see read()/write() being a "pass any crap" interface.  The
implementer of the target for read()/write() will probably still be
a driver which will need to decode what its given, whether its in
ASCII or binary.
And driver writers are already used to writing ioctl-like interfaces.
