Unless driverfs is mounted by default or by something other than 
/etc/fstab, no I don't have it on.
w/ Greg's USB driverfs patch : system proves to be stable.
    (though 2.5.3 sometimes looses my keyboard after a time?)
Raw -dj1:  explosion as above. [no ACPI (doesn't compile anyway), no 
preempt this time around, either.]
    (also lost my keyboard.  Odd.  Seems to be about 50% of the time 
with 2.5.3 + anything.)
