The current KNI extensions should make 2.3.x at some time. There is still a lot
to resolve on that one. Hopefully support for using them in user space only
at least will make 2.4
I've done basic Athlon stuff. I've yet to do copy*user and its like the KNI
stuff partly a problem of figuring how to handle the FPU/MMX braindamage
on X86 cpus
