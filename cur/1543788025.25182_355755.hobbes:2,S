Subject: [PATCH 1/2] NTFS: Fix a stupid bug in __ntfs_bitmap_set_bits_in_run()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

NTFS: Fix a stupid bug in __ntfs_bitmap_set_bits_in_run() which caused the
      count to become negative and hence we had a wild memset() scribbling
      all over the system's ram.
