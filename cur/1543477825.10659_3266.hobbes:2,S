Hi xconfig fans,
I have more xconfig bug fixes in progress.  So it's quite possible that
pre7-ac3 may be the xconfig that you see in 2.2.0, but please keep
sending bug reports.  That's what 2.2.1 is for.
It's also quite possible that all the stars and planets will line up
in time for 2.2.0.  I don't know, so I can't say.  So don't ask me any
scheduling questions unless your value is "mec->leader" or
"mec->leader->leader".  :)
