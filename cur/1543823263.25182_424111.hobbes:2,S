I get the exact same behavior, but:
sh-3.00# ls -alh /var/sub/woot/sub
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 40 May 15 18:09 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root root 60 May 15 18:09 ..
sh-3.00#
It does *not* recurse indefinitely here, because the mount tree is  
not recursive.  A bind mount (Or a --move, which is bind and umount - 
l), does not share submounts, so it's impossible to circularly link  
them.  This is why it's possible to do this:
mount --bind /var /apache1/bin
mount --bind /var /apache2/var
mount --bind /www1 /apache1/var/www
mount --bind /www2 /apache2/var/www

There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to  
make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the  
other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious  
deficiencies.  The first method is far more difficult.
