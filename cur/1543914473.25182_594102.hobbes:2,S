Well, ub does that today. And there is a measurable performance differential
with usb-storage when driving rotating discs, or so I heard.

I'm afraid this is valuable. However, a number of devices only return
garbage as residue if the transfer length is greater than 32KB. Limiting
that would trim this blacklist, I think. The vast majority of devices
work correctly in this regard, and ub checks the residue without any
blacklist.

It has something to do with the way our partition detection works. Linux
tends to rely on the reported device size. Windows reads the first block
and then goes further based on its contents. If we exterminate partitioning
code which uses the reported device size for autodetection, then this
problem will fix itself.

This is being worked upon. The recent change for floppies eliminated
a big number of those.
