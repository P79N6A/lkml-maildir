I would suspect that byte writes to the PCI command register (which is
defined as 16 bit word register) end up locking the PCI bus and/or the
device, so the sequence is probably the following: 
pcibios_read_config_byte works
pcibios_write_config_byte is posted/queued/retried/whatever but never
actually performed
then the following read_config_byte can't be performed
Does the following patch (use 16 bit access to the PCI command register
solve your problems), I'm not sure it is the solution but it sounds
as a reasonable workaround (still waiting for my PCI specs).
