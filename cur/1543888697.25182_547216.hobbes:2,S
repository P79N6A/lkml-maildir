Hmmmm.. I wish I was more familiar with PF_MEMALLOC. ccing Nick.

Ok that adds a new field to the page struct. I suggested a page flag in 
slub before.

Right that should work.

So the original issue is still not fixed. A slab alloc may succeed without
watermarks if that particular allocation is restricted to a different set 
of nodes. Then the reserve slab is dropped despite the memory scarcity on
another set of nodes?

No the gfp zone flags are not uniform and placement of page allocator 
allocs through SLUB do not always have the same allocation constraints.
SLUB will check the node of the page that was allocated when the page 
allocator returns and put the page into that nodes slab list. This varies
depending on the allocation context.
Allocations can be particular to uses of a slab in particular situations. 
A kmalloc cache can be used to allocate from various sets of nodes in 
different circumstances. kmalloc will allow serving a limited number of 
objects from the wrong nodes for performance reasons but the next 
allocation from the page allocator (or from the partial lists) will occur 
using the current set of allowed nodes in order to ensure a rough 
obedience to the memory policies and cpusets. kmalloc_node behaves 
differently and will enforce using memory from a particular node.
SLAB is very strict in that area and will not allow serving objects from 
the wrong node even with only kmalloc. Changing policy will immediately 
change the per node queue that SLAB takes its objects from.
