Hi,
I have a server running with RAID5 disks, under debian/stable, kernel
2.6.18-5-686. Yesterday the RAID resync'd for no apparent reason,
without even mdamd sending a mail to warn about that:
Sep  2 01:06:01 awak kernel: md: syncing RAID array md0
Sep  2 01:06:01 awak kernel: md: minimum _guaranteed_ reconstruction speed: 1000 KB/sec/disc.
Sep  2 01:06:01 awak kernel: md: using maximum available idle IO bandwidth (but not more than 200000 KB/sec) for reconstruction.
Sep  2 01:06:01 awak kernel: md: using 128k window, over a total of 48064 blocks.
Sep  2 01:06:01 awak kernel: md: delaying resync of md1 until md0 has finished resync (they share one or more physical units)
Sep  2 01:06:01 awak kernel: md: delaying resync of md2 until md0 has finished resync (they share one or more physical units)
Sep  2 01:06:05 awak kernel: md: md0: sync done.

In itself, this event is already strange. But what's even stranger is
that another guy had the same resync exactely at the same time (all
times are CEST (+0200)):

(reboot)
I'm still gathering informations (no idea what his disks are, etc.), but
does anyone have the same problem ? Does anyone know where it can come
from (debian trouble, md bug, drive firmware problem, rootkit, ..) and
how I can pinpoint that ?
Thanks,
	Xav
