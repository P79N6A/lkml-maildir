I'm not sure that you care but this is completely incompatible with the
direct I/O extension that I did in IRIX's NFS, which was the first
direct I/O NFS implementation anywhere.  The IRIX approach was to use
a different code path, direct I/O went through a TCP socket which was
carefully managed so that page flipping would work.  If you want to 
know the details I can dig them up but unless you are going down the
page flipping route, this looks fine.
