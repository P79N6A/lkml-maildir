Ok. So perhaps it's the branch creation during:
git checkout -b threadirqs origin/rt/threadirqs
Because yeah, that does show what I want. This is weird. Is there some
git expert who can tell me why I'm seeing linus merges in my local
branch? My local branch should be simply the same as the remote one...
