I had the same problem before I fixed the NVidia driver and AMD760MP support was added to agpgart (I have a GeForce 3 card and a Tyan Thunder K7). The NVidia
driver did not work properly with the MP chipset, nor did agpgart unless the module was loaded with agp_try_unsupported=1. When compiled as a module, and not
using the afore mentioned option, agpgart simply fails to load. The NVidia driver, not detecting AGP, drops to PCI mode and everything works fine.
When agpgart was modified to support the AMD760MP chipset, I compiled it into the kernel. At that point the NVidia driver would not load because it couldn't
talk to the AGP controller (it didn't know about it), and X would fail just like you see it. I fixed it by modifying the NVidia driver to recognise the AMD760MP
chipset, and now I have 99% AGP support (Fast Write does not currently work, but I will be working with NVidia next week to get everything 100%).
