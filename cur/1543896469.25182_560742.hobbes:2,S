inconvenient, yes, insecure, no.
I believe AA breaks POSIX, already. rename() is not expected to change
permissions on target, nor is link link. And yes, both of these make
AA insecure.

Possibly.

What demand? SELinux is superior to AA, and there was very little
demand for AA. Compare demand for reiser4 or suspend2 with demand for
AA.

Which are exactly the bits Christoph Hellwig and Al Viro
vetoed.

. I believe it takes more than "2 users want it" to overcome veto of
VFS maintainer.
