I'll explore that.  It may make very good sense.

What's the path to may_open() in that case?  open_namei() should wrap
all callers other than nfs, and it does:
	/* O_TRUNC implies we need access checks for write permissions */
        if (flag & O_TRUNC)
                acc_mode |= MAY_WRITE;
Which should trigger the may_open() code.  
later in open_namei():
...
ok:
        error = may_open(nd, acc_mode, flag);
        if (error)
                goto exit;
        return 0;
