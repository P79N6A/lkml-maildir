Netlink broadcast is multicast actually,
if listener exists, then message will be sent to him, 
if no - skb will be just freed.

Connector can be used to send data from userspace to kernelspace,
so it allows sending controlling messages without ioctl() compatibility 
mess and so on.
One may use cn_netlink_send() to send notification without being
registered 
in connector, if it's second parameter is 0, then appropriate 
connector listener will be searched for.
It is different from netlink messages, 
netlink is a transport layer for connector.

There is a check for listener in netlink_broadcast() - sk_for_each_bound
().
