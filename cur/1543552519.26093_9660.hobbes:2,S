Alpha DP264 UP.
Doing a dump to a SCSI MO disk (aic7xxx, Fujitsu Gigamo, ro ext2 fs), and
simultaneously writing a megabyte to a floppy (tar -cf /dev/fd0, "FDC 0 is
a post-1991 82077") produced a ten second freeze.  I did this twice and
it's reproducible.  The system froze including the mouse and returned to
normal afterwards.  vmstat looked like this:
   procs                      memory    swap          io     system         cpu
 r  b  w   swpd   free   buff  cache  si  so    bi    bo   in    cs  us  sy  id

The 100% sys cpu line is the one (this one only lasted about 6 seconds).
