An unfortunately inflamatory argument that avoids the real issue.  I'm 
not going to argue the security of NT (heaven forbid), but you do 
completely ignore the benefits of ACLs, including things that 
capabilities don't provide.
The fundamental problem is that while there is a many-to-many 
relationship between users and groups, there is only a one-to-many 
relationship between files and groups. This inequity breeds kludgy 
solutions to problems that would be easy with the many-to-many 
group/file relationships that ACLs provide
A simple example would be four non-root users of a system where user A 
would like to provide read and write access to a file with users B and C 
but not D and access to another file with C and D, but not B. Without 
ACLs this is jut not possible without root setting up one group that 
encompasses B and C, and another for C and D. Obviously not a scalable 
or convenient solution.
This trivial example get's magnified when trying to delegate 
administration tasks on a large system. In these cases, groups could 
feasibly be set up to encompass every permutation, but can quickly get 
unwieldy.
I'm not at all opposed to capabilities, but I don't believe they come 
close to obviating ACLs. It also doesn't seem ACLs and capabilities are 
in any kind of conflict. Why could we not have both?
