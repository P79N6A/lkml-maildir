even with ten thousand threads it is still pretty fast. Certainly not 
'10 times slower' as you claimed. And it takes only a single, trivial 
outer event loop to lift it up to the performance levels of a pure event 
based server.
conclusion: currently i dont see a compelling need for the kevents 
subsystem. epoll is a pretty nice API and it covers most of the event 
sources and nicely builds upon our existing poll() infrastructure.
furthermore, i very much contest your claim that a high-performance, 
highly scalable webserver needs a kevent+nonblock design. Even if i 
ignore all the obvious usability and maintainance-cost advantages of 
threadlets.

no. Please read the evserver_threadlet.c code. There's no kevent in 
there. There's no epoll() in there. All that you can see there is the 
natural behavior of pure threadlets. And it's not a workload /I/ picked 
for threadlets - it is a workload, filesize, parallelism level and 
request handling function /you/ picked for "event-servers".
