Are you kidding? Do you really want to use that on device's registers ?

Ok, branch has a penalty but it's certainly != pipeline flush.
Note that this is unconditional branch, and if the branch target address
is computed sufficiently ahead of the branch instruction there will be
no penalty.

Have Intel released docs about some implementation of the architecture ?
OTOH, judging from past experience, I wan't be surprised
if Intel ain't got it Right *again*. (OK, OK, just kidding,
people (and companies) sometimes grow up and learn things :-)
