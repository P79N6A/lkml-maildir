 Note the 8254 timer uses edge-triggered interrupts and is just a square
wave signal.  There's no acking to deassert the interrupt -- it goes away
spontaneously after a predefined time.

 Yep, but the timer is non-shareable by definition.

 This may be possible, but complicated and likely unreliable -- an I/O
APIC may deliver a spurious interrupt at the time a real one would be
probable and you can't check if a period between two consecutive timer
interrupts is appropriate without an additional time reference, which may
be unavailable (like the TSC).
 Note the timer is special -- we don't really do any device handling, but
we want to get periodic interrupts at the right times to have a time
reference.  Coalescing interrupts or discarding spurious ones, which is
normal and acceptable for regular devices, doesn't work here.
