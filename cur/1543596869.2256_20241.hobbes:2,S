There are some machines (like the Compaq Proliant ML770 - 
http://www.compaq.com/products/quickspecs/10698_div/10698_div.html
) that
are actually sold as 32 way systems based on Pentium III Xeon CPU's, so
why not let the cpu array be able to handle that many CPU's by default
(maybe make a config option?)?
