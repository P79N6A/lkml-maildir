I had implemented something along the lines of what you suggested in a
previous email:
  - Add flag to klist_node: n_attached.
  - Use that in klist_node_attached()
  - Check during klist_next(), and skip nodes that have been removed.
  - Reset flag during klist_del().
Based on the deadlock that occurs when using klist_remove() during an
iteration over that the list, and the common indirect usage of it (parents
and buses unregistering devices, drivers unbinding devices), I've just
removed klist_remove() and the embedded completion. I'll post updated
patches soon.
Thanks,
