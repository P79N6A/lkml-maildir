   You can disable syslogd's syncing by prepending a '-' to the filename:
   I have *destroyed* seagate scsi drives by syslog's fsync'ing too much.
   (A syslog server handling 50 syslog lines/sec on average)
Well, the patch I posted won't decrease the number of write requests,
although it might reduce the number of read requests if the system is
tight on memory and there isn't enough space to keep all of the indirect
blocks in core at the same time.  (If the latter is true, though, then
your system is probably *really* badly hurting as a result of the
syslogd's fsync() handling.)
I agree that if you have a syslog server which is separate from the
machine actually doing the logging (and therefore the syslog server is
likely to stay up across whatever problem might cause its clients to
crash and burn), it makes perfectly good sense to disable's syslogd's
behaviour of prepending a '-' to the filename.
