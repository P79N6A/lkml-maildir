Yes, entry.S in Xen is a lot more complicated because of the event 
channel stuff.  I don't think we're adverse to supporting the event 
channel interface, I just think that you can actually get a cleaner and 
simpler implementation without it.

Still required for VMI kernels on native - so the padding of sti doesn't 
affect the holdoff in that case.  We actually do use sysenter.  We've 
done the benchmarks, and found the tradeoffs and benefits are similar 
for both approaches.
