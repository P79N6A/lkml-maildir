So why did you stop including them in the mm patch?
I recall your quality issue and Tom was all in favor
of resolving them. Was it too much work cleaning up the 
patches to meet your needs that lead to the patch being
dropped from the mm series?
kgdb over ethernet is working great, and it looks like there
is plenty of support on the SF mailing list.

I've only read a positive point of view on resolving the issues on the
mailing list.

I agree, it would likely attract many more maintainers and be easier 
to maintain with git than patches.

How about a concrete list of patch quality issues that the group
can address to allow your weekly addition to the mm patch as a 
set toward eventually integration.
Wouldn't getting kgdb back into the mm patch series be a reasonable
first step eventual maintenance in kernel.org? I hadn't even noticed
that it had been dropped until today's discussion in the crash mailing
list.
