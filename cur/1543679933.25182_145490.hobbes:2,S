Note that the issue that started the discussion is somewhat different: the 
performance impact of having to map the pages with sleeping kmap's because 
of the old virtual-address-pointer interfaces.
That won't even show up on most setups, but it can be rather nasty on big 
boxes with lots of ram and several CPU's. Do we care? Possibly not, but I 
think from a design standpoint it would be better to not have the problem.
