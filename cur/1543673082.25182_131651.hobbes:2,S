	By Intense traffic I mean that the traffic on one path through the
switch is a little more than 10mb/s.
	My testing enviroment is an isolated lab environment. I only use
4 ports and the uplink port is not used. Each of the 4 ports is
connected to one ethernet card. That is why I concluded that the
10mb/s traffic is intense since for the first 5 minutes the switch is a
switch and then becomes a hub.
	As I said, I used a little expensive swicth (also auto-sensing
dumb one) and solved the problem. That is why I concluded a very cheap
swicth (<$100) may be not good in some scenarios. Of course for household
use,
it is definitely a good choice.

P.S. I only intend to provide some information and all my testing is for
a rigid academic objective.
