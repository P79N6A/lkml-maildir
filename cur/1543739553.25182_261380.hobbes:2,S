Yes it may. Though this is getting nitpicking; please re-read:
"A descriptor shall be considered ready for reading when a call to an
input function with O_NONBLOCK clear would not block, whether or not the
function would transfer data successfully. (The function might return
data, an end-of-file indication, or an error other than one indicating
that it is blocked, and in each of these cases the descriptor shall be
considered ready for reading.)"
No claim is made for O_NONBLOCK set; so in that case we can do something
sane.

Point taken. For UDP, returning EIO in both cases is just fine (it's
actually also correct, for a checksum error constitutes a "network read
error"...). At least according to the spec.
