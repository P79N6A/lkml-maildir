Thanks - that works, with a slight modification:
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,5)
#include <linux/sched.h>
static inline void __recalc_sigpending(void)
{
	recalc_sigpending(current);
}
#define recalc_sigpending() __recalc_sigpending ()
#endif
The goal is to have code that just works in 2.5 without compat crap like
jffs2_recalc_sigpending, and to fix it up in the headers only for older
kernels. Most of the changes in 2.5 (and indeed 2.4) have been done in a way
that makes such an approach feasible. 
I had been assuming this was intentional good design; perhaps it was just a
fluke.
