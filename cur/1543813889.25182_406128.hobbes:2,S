Do you want all the drivers that just return pci_register_driver(&foo)
to be changed as well?  I haven't heard a compelling argument either way,
but there are certainly many drivers that return 0 when they successfully
register a driver that didn't find any devices, e.g., 
    static int __init serial8250_pci_init(void)
    {
        return pci_register_driver(&serial_pci_driver);
    }
