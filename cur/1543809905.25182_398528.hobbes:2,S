Ok, can a kernel function that is not part of a driver do that? Something 
like: get_task_from_fown(..), or get_inode_of_process_fown(..)?

Since Luke's patch didn't got accepted, I wasn't expecting mine to be.
But I am not giving up this easily. There has to be a way to solve this 
problem. As a last resort, I'll try to maintain this as separate patch to be 
applied to the kernel, but that is something I'd really try to avoid, 
because:
- it would need updating with every kernel version => each kernel version a 
new patch
- fixing bugs would take N times longer (N=kernel version - initial kernel 
version)
- I am no kernel hacker, so I am not the appropiate person to maintain such a 
patch
....
Even if all of it can't be done inside the kernel, I'd like to do as much as I 
can of it, and maybe leave the rest to userspace. (By exporting needed stuff 
via /proc, or /sys, such as socket/inode mappings, socket/process mappings). 
But I believe the proper place to do this is inside the kernel.
Patrick McHardy ([1]) said that SELinux should do this, and it will be ready 
soon. How would SELinux accomplish this?
