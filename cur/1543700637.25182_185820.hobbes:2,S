There are two goals here. Not having a batch process on one siling makes
sense, and I'm going to try Con's patch after I try Nick's latest.
Actually, if they play nicely I would use both, batch would be very
useful for nightly report generation on servers.
But WRT the whole HT scheduling, it would seem that ideally you want to
schedule the two (or N) processes which have the lowest aggregate cache
thrash, if you had a way to determine that. I suspect that a process
which had a small itterative inner loop with a code+data footprint of
2-3k would coexist well with almost anything else. Minimizing the FPU
contention also would improve performance, no doubt. I don't know that
there are the tools at the moment to get this information, but it seems
as though until it's available any scheduling will be working in the
dark to some extent.
Feel free to tell me I misread this problem.

I my experience, on servers it's more important to avoid really bad
behaviour all of the time than to have perfect behaviour most of the
time. All of the recent scheduler work from Nick, Con and Ingo has
avoided "jackpot cases" quite well, for which I thank you and encourage
you to continue. If server response goes from 20ms to 100ms Saturday
night, we discuss it at a status meeting Monday morning and make
suggestions to management. If response goes to 2sec we discuss it with
management at 2am and they make suggestions :-(
So far 2.6.0 has been quite good at "bend but do not break" under load.
Great job!
