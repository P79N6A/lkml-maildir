In general, I'm a bit disappointed at the time it takes new drivers to
reach the upstream kernel.  I grant that a lot of vendor drivers are
unreadable, unmergable shite...  but on the other side of the coin, I
see a lot of decent drivers get stalled simply because they aren't
perfect.
I would rather see a driver get "95% there" -- because once a driver is
merged into the upstream kernel, it has a lot more visibility, and will
inevitably receive the remaining changes and cleanups anyway.
