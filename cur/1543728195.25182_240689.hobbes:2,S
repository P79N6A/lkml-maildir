I agree. But time isn't divided evenly across the year, if you've ever
worked on a project you know there's a crunch time close to release
where you don't have time to do that. You only have time to fix things.
I'm not saying that's a good thing, but it happens. Then later you have
to go and push some of that stuff out, it's the individual package
maintainers duty to do so.

If you had followed this thread at all, you'd know that in this case we
could either add the feature or spend 100% of the time being sucked into
the black hole of email writing that is Joerg.
Maybe you should consider why _every_ distro adds that patch? It's not a
new patch, it's been around for years. It's not one single distro
"forking" the code base, it's basically the same thing we ship.
