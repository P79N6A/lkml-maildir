	I guess you are the one doing most of the work in 2.5.X, and
most outside drivers are only targetting 2.4.X.

	Don't rush, I'm not sure if you are done with USB

	If my driver was static, I would not care. But because I need
to fix and update it, the patching and testing work is multiplied by

	Bah, I'm not really complaining. I was just thinking that it
would be a nice feature, but I can live without it.
