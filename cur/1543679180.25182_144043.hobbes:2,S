Last time I measured it, it had about a 10% overhead in kernel time.
Seems like a good thing to keep as an option to me. Bill said he
had some other code to alleviate the overhead, but I don't think
it's merged ... I'd rather see UKVA (permanently map the pagetables
on a per-process basis) merged before it becomes "not an option" -
that gets rid of all the kmapping.
