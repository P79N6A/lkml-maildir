I tried booting 2.6.14-rc2 on my firewall last Wednesday and it failed
to get its IP address via bootp.  I did not see any packets being
transmitted from the machine.
I was going to do some investigation this weekend until I also found
that it would mean that PCMCIA on the box would be busted, which,
unfortunately, means it's useless to run a later kernel.  Hence the
investigation is shelved until I've sorted out PCMCIA userland.
