I'm very interested how do you account free/dirty space in LogFS:
* When you need to write new data, how do you select the place where to
write?
* When you run out of space, how do select find the segment to
garbage-collect?
For any given segment (or eraseblock), how do you find amount of free
and dirty space in it?
