It tells us neither.  This could be a new kernel bug which only certain old
userspace setups are known to trigger.  Until we know exactly why this is
occurring, we don't know where the bug is.
And once we've worked that thing out, and if we determine that the bug is
in userspace then we might be able to craft the patch in such a fashion
that the old userspace continues to work, which would be a win.
