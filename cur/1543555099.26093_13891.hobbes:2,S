Certainly a good approach. It's also basically the idea behind newlib,
although newlib has more overhead.
Ultimately, I want to be able to compile regular Unix/Linux programs
out of the box. Right now, this works for a bunch of trivial programs,
and it almost works for ash.

Precisely why I went to newlib ... It's really a pity that glibc is
such a monster.

Hmm, this would be tricky. You could do it by implementing a simple
tar file reader in the kernel, which reads from /dev/initrd (well, it's
in-kernel representation), but I'm not sure if this buys you that much
in the end. (How much overhead is in block devices anyway ?)
