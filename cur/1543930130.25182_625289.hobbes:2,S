Thanks, I'll try this, to see if there's a dependency on that. But it's 
not a really solution for a virtualization system to work with less 
memory ;-). I also read that there's maybe a problem with intel graphics 
media accelerator driver in conjunction with more than 4GB RAM and 
kernel will hang on boot, but I think this is fixed, I can boot. So 
securly, I put out i915 series drivers and frame buffer support in 
kernel config. The grahpics adapter onboard works with shared memory 
technology. I configured 128M in BIOS...
