Indeed, if /usr/src/linux/patches was a file, the conflicts would be 
impossible to manage.  But suppose it was a directory and each patch 
created a small description file in that directory.  This would provide the 
desired information without having the big mess :-)
It's been suggested that config info be saved using the following:
         <.config sed -e '/^#/d' -e '/^[    ]*$/d' | gzip -9 >> image
The patch descriptions could be saved in a similar manner:
         cat /usr/src/linux/patches/* | gzip -9 >> image
Alternatively, instead of outputting to image, one could output to 
/boot/patch-$KERNELVERSION, (or wherever)
