These questions were posed to me and I was hoping someone would have 
better knowledge about the works and usage of SATA then I do.  All of 
these questions are around understanding how important the performance 
of PIO mode is.
How often would one run in PIO mode?  Why would one run in PIO mode?
Thanks
