Odd.  When I profile Linux with EMON, I see tons of them.  Anywhere code
does
mov    eax, addr
mov    [addr], ebx
one will get generated.  Even something as simple as:
mov    eax, addr
inc    eax
dec    eax
mov    [addr]. ebx
will avoid an AGI (since the other pipeline has now been allowed a few
clocks to fetch the address and load it).
