I'm assuming this was a paste from before your patch was applied and
that bd->props.brightness has a positive value when these calls were
made afterwards. Since the ibm backlight currently ignores fb_blank, it
shouldn't blink the backlight.
The screen still probably blinks since the framebuffer driver will see
the blank request too.
