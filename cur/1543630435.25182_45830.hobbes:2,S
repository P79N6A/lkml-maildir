Already done. I booted with the rescue system from the installation CD 
and I rewrote /etc/raidtab. The partition table seems OK, the partitions 
  have the correct sizes and the correct types.
The raid array starts fine and /proc/mdstat reports everything OK

Just done that.
It's asked me the fs type and I've entered the one you told me. It 
seemed to work. I ran --rebuild-tree after that and it started replaying 
the journal - which it had not done before - but then it still died with 
"wrong superblock". The exact message is:
init_source_bitmap: bitmap 0 (of 6450048 bits) is wrong - make all 
blocks [0-32768] as used
init_control_bitmap: wrong super block
I guess I made things worse with my initial attempt as rebuilding the 
superblock.
BTW - I tried, as I have nothing to lose at this point :) - to re-do 
--rebuild-sb and now it doesn't ask for the version

Thanks very much for your help
