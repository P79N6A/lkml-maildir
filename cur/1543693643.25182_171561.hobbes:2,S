Subject: IBM Thinkpad A21 BIOS - EDD information wrong
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Anyone here know the IBM Thinkpad A21 BIOS developers?  Their EDD data
is wrong.  They're reporting the disk controller is at PCI device
00:1f.7 when it's really at 00:1f.1, which would confuse any Linux tool
trying to make use of it.
Relevant portions of EDD device data, lspci, and dmidecode appended.  If
you can point me at the proper folks within IBM, I'd appreciate it.
