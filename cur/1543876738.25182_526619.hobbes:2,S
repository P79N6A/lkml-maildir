Won't there be some master (VFS) namespace which can see everything? The
idea would be then to list all containers in that namespace. I am
visualizing that a master namespace listing all containers like that 
will be like a management console, from which you can monitor/control
resource consumption of all containers.
I agree the individual containers themselves should not be able to
mount and view other containers in this container/resource-control
filesystem. I presume existing VFS namespace mechanism would enforce
that restriction.

I don't think they are. From Serge's patches, a new group (or a directory in
container filesystem) is created everytime a new nsproxy is created
(copy_namespaces/sys_unshare).
