Subject: cannot disable INET from (arm-)linux-2.4.17

Hi all,
I was advised to re-post this to your mailing list, instead of       
linux-arm-kernel@lists.arm.linux.org.uk - hopefully this is the right place.
I just completed a build of 2.4.17 patched for ARM (SA11x0), and ran across
this problem: if I disable TCP/IP (INET), some stuff in Networking (NET) fails.
This comes from the reference in net/core/rtnetlink.c to tcp.h, which calls
ecn_tcp.h, and further addresses 'af_inet' in the sock structure, although it
is not defined. As a result, I had to get INET back into my .config , which of
course is an annoyance. Does any of you have experienced this already? Is there
a fix?
Besides, I would very much like your comments on running the SA11x0 with or
without MMU. What other patch(es) are you using on this platform?
Please respond to me personally (in Cc: at least), as I am not (yet) registered
to this mailing list.
Thanks,
Guilhem.
