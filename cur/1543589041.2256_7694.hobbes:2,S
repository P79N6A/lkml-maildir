And sometimes three times, if you count the PAGE_AGE_START bonus
points you get whenever your age is found to be 0 (or less than
PAGE_AGE_START).  I think I see the idea, but seems more voodoo.
If you're looking to _simplify_ in this area, there's a confusing
host (9) of intercoupled age-up-and-down de/activate functions.
Aren't those better decoupled? i.e. the ageing ones ageonly,
the de/activate ones not messing with age at all.
Then I think you're left with just age_page_up() and age_page_down()
(maybe inlines as below, assuming the PAGE_AGE_START voodoo), plus
activate_page(), deactivate_page() and deactivate_page_nolock().
static inline void age_page_up(struct page *page)
{
	page->age += PAGE_AGE_ADV;
	if (page->age > PAGE_AGE_MAX)
		page->age = PAGE_AGE_MAX;
	else if (page->age < PAGE_AGE_START + PAGE_AGE_ADV)
		page->age = PAGE_AGE_START + PAGE_AGE_ADV;
}
static inline void age_page_down(struct page *page)
{
	page->age >>= 1;
}
But this is no more than tidying, don't let me distract you.
