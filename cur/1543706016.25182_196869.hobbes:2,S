Well, I think secure deletion should be an option for everyone. Using 
encryption is a data hiding technique, you prevent people for detemining 
what sort of data is being stored there. Now, admittedly I dont know at 
what level the reiser4 encryption appears, but I would think its safer 
to have complete erasure when a file deleted regardless of how well 
protected its contents were.
just a thought.
