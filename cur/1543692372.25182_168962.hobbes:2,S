note that the compile and build of the kernel finish with NO errors.
note that there are NO modules in this build.
Then note that there is some some silly error about:
    No module aic7xxx found for kernel 2.6.0-test6
during the 'make install' that causes the install to fail.
I have been seeing this error ever since -test1.
Has anyone tracked this thing down???
