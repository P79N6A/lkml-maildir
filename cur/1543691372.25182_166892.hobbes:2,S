No. I can still boot your box, mount your root file-system, and
change the root password, all without you even knowing it.
If I have physical control of a computer, I own it. I can
do anything I want with it. If you could really prevent
somebody from "breaking in", then you can never sell it and
you are screwed if the password file gets corrupt (you would have
to throw everything away).
This patch is not useful.
