Hi...
My 2 ATA cd-roms, drived with libata, are not auto-mounted in gnome.
How can I debug this ?
Can I se if the kernel sends the correct events ?
udevmonitor says this when a zip disk is inserted and ejected:
werewolf:/home/magallon# udevmonitor
udevmonitor prints the received event from the kernel [UEVENT]
and the event which udev sends out after rule processing [UDEV]
UEVENT[1158015418.725812] add@/block/sda/sda1
UDEV  [1158015419.262449] add@/block/sda/sda1
UEVENT[1158015420.057831] mount@/block/sda/sda1
UDEV  [1158015420.058905] mount@/block/sda/sda1
UEVENT[1158015428.923382] umount@/block/sda/sda1
UDEV  [1158015428.924473] umount@/block/sda/sda1
It says nothing when I insert a CD in the readers.
Any idea ?
Should it generate an event for sr0 ?
TIA
