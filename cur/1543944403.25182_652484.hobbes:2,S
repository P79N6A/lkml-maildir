I was trying to avoid holding resize lock for entire duration of
remove_section(), which includes removing sysfs entries etc. Its
needed only to decode and clear out sectionmap. (I am no longer 
passing pfns).
Whats wrong with passing section_nr ? It simply checks if that
section exists and if so removes sysfs entries and corresponding
sectionmap.  What wrong thing can happen ?

I know. It looked like a round about of getting section_nr while
we have that information easily available.
If you are really passionate about passing mem_section*, sure I
can do that :)
