AIX licenses Sun's NFS-server, and Sun's NFS-server is buggy. There are
patches available for Solaris, but not for AIX.

The corruption is caused by the fact that Sun's NFS-server ignores the
packet-size field and uses the actual size of the packet instead.

Hmmmm. It seems to work for us (we're experiencing the same problems here)
if you use 1k or 2k blocksize.
