Actually, the reason this is done is because the per_cpu_offset[] is
designed to be replaced by a register or an expression on archs which
care, and this is simple.  The main problem is that so many archs want
different things, it's a very UN task to build infrastructure.
I have always recommended using the same scheme to implement real
dynamic per-cpu allocation (which would then replace the mini-allocator
inside the module code).  In fact, I had such an implementation which I
reduced to the module case (dynamic per-cpu was too far-out at the
time).
The arch would allocate a virtual memory hole for each CPU, and map
pages as required (this is the simplest of several potential schemes).
This gives the "same space between CPUs" property which is required for
the ptr + per-cpu-offset scheme.  An arch would supply functions like:
	/* Returns address of new memory chunk(s)
         * (add __per_cpu_offset to get virtual addresses). */
	unsigned long alloc_percpu_memory(unsigned long *size);
	/* Set by ia64 to reserve the first chunk for percpu vars
	 * in modules only.
	#define __MODULE_RESERVE_FIRST_CHUNK
And an allocator would work on top of these.
I'm glad someone is looking at this again!
Rusty.
