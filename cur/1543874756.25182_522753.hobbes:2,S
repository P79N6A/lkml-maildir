Hi all
On i386 , 2.6.20 / 2.6.21-rc4 :
# gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore
error
# file /proc/kcore
error
Apparently we can not llseek() anymore on this file (returns -EINVAL)
On x86_64 2.6.20 it's working
# file /proc/kcore
/proc/kcore: ELF 64-bit LSB core file x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), SVR4-style
On i386 2.6.14 it's working too.
Eric
