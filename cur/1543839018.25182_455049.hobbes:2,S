Hi Willy,
first thank you for continuing work for 2.4, our company still relies on it 
for a lot of machines.

Yes, we've already experienced problems with new hw. We could solve most of 
the stuff with some vendor supplied patches. But now we got performance 
problems with ICH7 SATA performance: a disk does only about 11MB/s on 2.4 
with all 2.4 patches from Jeff applied while we get about 40MB/s on 2.6.16. 
Backporting the libata changes done between 2.6.15 (I think that is about the 
same codebase as the current 2.4 stuff) and 2.6.16 seems like a big task.
So my question is: what is your policy on new or enhanced drivers (not just 
new pciids)?
Kind regards,
Gerd
