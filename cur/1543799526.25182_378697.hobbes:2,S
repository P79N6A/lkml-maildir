Yes, but most of my machines have a ! CONFIG_PREEMPT kernel, so 
preempt_enable()/preempt_disable() are empty, thus faster than CLI/STI for sure :)
Then, maybe the patch that moves 'current' in a dedicated x86_64 register may 
help to lower  the cost of preempt_enable()/preempt_disable() on a 
CONFIG_PREEMPT kernel ?
