the reality looks a bit differently (at least on machines overcommited with containers):
1. OOM can be unable to free enough memory for the system to do some
   real progress in some real-life situations. So you can't login and check.
2. People do not tend to monitor the logs and check the issue immeadeately when
   it happened. So having an information collected from the kernel is really helpfull.
   show_mem() does exactly the same on OOM.
So it is up to you, but I would suggest to commit.
Locking introduced here is simple and overhead-free on fast paths.
Thanks,
Kirill
