You are right, of course, but then ASN Stephens is also right for reporting
a problem in the -ac patches.  Or do you expect people to ignore bugs in the
-ac series and let bugs go unreported?  How will the -ac series improve, and
ultimately, how will the official Linux kernel improve?
Granted, in this case, Alan already knew the problem.  :-)
Cheers,
