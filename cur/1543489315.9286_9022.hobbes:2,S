I was reluctant to try 2.2.2 because of reports of scsi lockups due to some
timer error. I've seen the fix floating around and I know it's in the -ac's
and -pre's, but I wanted to stay on the Linus Tree.
What about the "eth0: Too much work in interrupt" coming from 2.0.36 on the
same machine? That can't be a 2.2.1 bug...
