Hiya,
I've catch the problem !
On my config file, I was using CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR but it seems that I haven't this technology.
This option affects the USB and the sound on my system, so my modem was out and the sound buggy.
Now I removed this option and everything works perfectly.
Thanks to everyone and keep up the good work ;)
Best regards,
