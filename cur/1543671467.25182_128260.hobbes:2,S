I have a p4s533 mainboard (ASUS) with a SiS 646 chipset.
Currently, I do use 2.4.21-pre4, but I want to apply some patches that are 
only available for 2.4.20 :(
My question Is : is there any backport of the 646 driver available for the 
2.4.20 kernel?
Regards.
Carlos
P.D: sorry for my ugly english o:-)
