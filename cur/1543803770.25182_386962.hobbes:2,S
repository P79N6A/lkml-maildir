Currently call trace on x86-64 prints offset in decimal.
Do you think it is better to print offset in hex on x86-64 too?
But Andi Kleen said he likes compact call trace in the reply to
my first version of these patches.
And do you have any objection to remove symbolsize output in
print_symbol()? I can't find useful usage about symbolsize in
print_symbol() except to do a double check that the oops is
matching the vmlinux we're looking at. (so I made 4/4)
Do you know any useful usage about symbolsize?
