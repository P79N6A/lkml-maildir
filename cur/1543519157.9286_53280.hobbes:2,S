Hi,
Datapoint, don't have enough time to investigate further. 
- My Maxtor 27G drive ends up in PIO mode (non-SMP system, but likely
an SMP-compiled kernel).
Last time I reported this, I had a WDC31600, as hda, and the maxtor as
hdb. Everyone was convinced that the WD was crap and causing the
interrupt timeouts and the switchback to PIO.
I removed the WD, and forgot to change the jumper on the maxtor. So
the maxtor is now alone as drive hdb. It is still geting timeouts and
then the switchback to PIO.
I have an PIIX IDE controller. The system runs Kernel 2.2.14pre2.
				Roger.
