If you're going to add a new api, you might as well go with the sysctl-by-name 
patch above, which looks reasonably small and simple to me from a very quick 
glance at a 2.6.0-era patch.
The advantage of breaking /proc/sys into a separate filesystem doesn't 
introduce a new API (although possibly a new line in the init scripts), so 
existing software doesn't have to change to use it, which is good.  It 
increases orthogonality and granularity, which embedded guys like me are 
generally in favor of. :)
On the other hand, if you're adding a system call to get a file descriptor to 
an arbitrary superblock you can then openat...  How do you refer to said 
superblock?  (Perhaps invent a "volume" syntax for all the superblocks, ala 
the amiga?  Do the /proc and /sys superblocks exist if nobody's mounted them 
yet?  Yes the open could instantiate them, but I'm wondering about the "list 
available filesystems that aren't in your namespace" and the security fun 
from that.  Presumably this is doable as non-root, because if you're root you 
can just mount /proc and /sys and go from there...)
You could also special case "mount" so that if you try to mount sysfs on /sys 
or proc on /proc (and they're not already mount points) you don't need to be 
root.  Seems a bit evil, though...
