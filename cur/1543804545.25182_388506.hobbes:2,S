Subject: hugetlbfs on ARM / how to mmap() 36-bit PCI memory?

I just went through an experiment trying to mmap a PCI resource via
the /sys/bus/pci/devices/<device name>/resource[n] on a XSC3 platform.
 I discovered, correct me if I am wrong, that remap_pfn_range only
acts on 2nd level (4K) pte's.  On this platform PCI memory is only
available at a 36-bit physical address.
In looking for an answer I found this post from Deepak in the thread:
"clean way to support >32bit addr on 32bit CPU "
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=110540164100006&r=1&w=2

Not doable. I believe PAE allows for normal 4K pages to be used when
mapping > 32-bits. XSC3 and ARMv6 only allow for > 32 bit addresses
when using 16MB pages (supersections), so we need to instead use
the hugetlb approach.

Questions
1) Currently ARM does not appear to have support for hugetlbfs, is
this in the works / any pointers to help get me started with the code?
2) Does the hugetlbfs interface support PCI memory or is it only meant for RAM?
3) Is there a better approach than hugetlb to mmap PCI space in this scenario?
Thanks,
Dan
