Why is only the opinion of an US lawyer important?
E.g. if you distribute something in Germany and a German kernel 
developer thinks the code you distribute violates the licence of a part 
of the kernel he has the copyright on German copyright law applies - and 
German copyright law is quite different from US copyright law.
