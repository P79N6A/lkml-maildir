I'm sending this personally and to the list.  Again I can't keep up with the
list, so if Brett or anyone else has further advice or questions, please
contact me directly.

SuSE 8.1 doesn't seem to have it.

Yeah, that's better than ARCH-VENDOR-OS.  The rpm --rebuild command's
assumed arch of i486 was fine with me, the problem is the assumed cpu of
i686.
Any chance that the rpm --rebuild command's arch-vendor-os might really mean
cpu-vendor-os?  Nah, I guess you would have said so if it were.

Oh, it doesn't need --target=i586-intel-linux  :-?  (By the way, the reason
I come up with snarky questions like this one is that I RTFM.  Sigh.)
