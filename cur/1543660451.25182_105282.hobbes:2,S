Hmm,
that might work, but when when the chipset is not supported we also see the 
the oppereation not permitted messages.
So Santosh, if you run hdparm as root and still get those messages, your 
chipset might not be suppported. Your /var/log/messages should give you more 
information about whats going on, especially the kernel-ide detection lines. 
Without further information about your mainboard and the kernel version you 
are using, all of this is only speculation.
