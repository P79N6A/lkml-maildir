The intermingling of 'flags', 'mode' and 'mode_flags' to refer to the
low bits, the high bits or all the bits of the flags field is handled
fairly carefully in your patch, but can still be a bit difficult to
keep track of which is which when reading.
I'll wager not many readers can immediately say what the 'mode',
'mode_flags' and 'flags' refer to, in the above code snippet, for
example.
Do you have any suggestions on how to further improve the clarity of
this code?
