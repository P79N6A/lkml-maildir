Hi folks,
Find below a new version of mmc_omap.diff patch that includes more 
corrections, all regarding Russel's suggestions:
  - Modification of if statement in mmc_omap_start_command(), because
now it's supplying the command type via cmd->flags.
  - Use of request_irq() with appropriate SA_TRIGGER flag.
  - As IRQs will never be disabled in mmc_omap_suspend() and calling
mmc_suspend_host with IRQs disable might it sleep, the if statement was
removed.
  - Use of helper functions platform_get_irq() and platform_get_resource()
in mmc_omap_probe().
  - As gcc isn't so efficient working out bit patterns from switch
statements, this was re-implemented in mmc_omap_cmd_done() using if
statement, that will be more efficient.
  - As MMCI resources don't contain virtual addresses and casting it
to a virtual addresses is incorrect, this was corrected in mmc_omap_probe().
All suggestions and comments are welcome.
BR,
Carlos
