We really should, but there really are some rare cases where it is 
actually ok.
In particular, you _can_ do math, if you just do the proper
"kernel_fpu_begin()"/"kernel_fpu_end()" around it, and you have reason to 
believe that you can assume a math processor exists. 
Is it needed? I dunno. I'd frown on it in general, but I don't see it 
being fundamentally wrong under the rigth circumstances.
