yes sure, i was relying on the openvz wiki to avoid duplicated efforts on
this topic but i guess email is just the one and only tool for this kind of
development :)

OK. It would be nice to make sure this is still in use before trying to
deal with /proc/sys/kernel/cad_pid.

what do you mean by extending cad_pid ? kill_init() ?

OK. That's what i imagined also but we need a bit more of the pid namespace
to regenerate the numerical value. So, how will you convert this 'struct
pid*' in a pid value using the current pid namespace ?
thinking aloud :
* if the pid namespace of the sending struct pid and current match,
	use nr.
* if they don't,
	if the sending pid namespace is the ancestor of the current pid
	namespace
		use 0
	else
		it's a bug.
struct pid* needs a pid namespace attribute and pid namespace needs to know
its parent.
