If you want to use it for that I would suggest to port the numa emulation
code at least - two or four nodes tends to find more problems than a single
node.
But testing on a 64bit box - even with numa emulation - would be much
better because on 32bit ZONE_NORMAL often is node 0 only and you won't 
get much numaness for kernel objects.

Well it will still increase the bug numbers you care so much about.
Another reason I don't like it is that it's ugly and reimplements
parts of ACPI on its own for no reason.
If people use it regularly for debugging maybe it won't bit rot
as quickly as it used to be, but there is a big difference between
theory and practice so we'll see.

Fine.
