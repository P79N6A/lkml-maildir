One micro issue, Andries help me out, with the bios_disk assignment.
Generally the BIOS defaults to think there is an IDE block device.
Thus the only order issue that I can drag up is the classic IDE<>SCSI
BIOS issue.
I know it is easy to push LILO around and remap 0x80, 0x81, 0x82, and 0x83
back and forth.
Is there a realistic way to define the default block device class to boot
with a "(b)zdisk"?
