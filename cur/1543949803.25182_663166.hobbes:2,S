OK, I've updated his patch. Tejun, can you audit this?

Subject: [PATCH] block: separate out padding from alignment
Block layer alignment was used for two different purposes - memory
alignment and padding.  This causes problems in lower layers because
drivers which only require memory alignment ends up with adjusted
rq->data_len.  Separate out padding such that padding occurs iff
driver explicitly requests it.
Tomo: restorethe code to update bio in blk_rq_map_user
      introduced by the commit 40b01b9bbdf51ae543a04744283bf2d56c4a6afa
      according to padding alignment.
