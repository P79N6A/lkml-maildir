No.  ext2 itself limits file sizes to ~4TB when using a 4KB blocksize.  Of
course on 32 bit platforms you're limited to a max 2TB filesystem size.
The 2GB limitation on 32 bit platforms is due to limitations in the VFS of
kernels prior to 2.4.

Either use a 64 bit machine, a 2.4 kernel, or apply one of the LFS patches
to 2.2.  Several vendors ship LFS enabled 2.2 kernels already (Red Hat in
the Enterprise Edition, and SuSE does as well iirc).
