Agreed.  It isn't an arch detail that they need to be unmasked in
the pci configuration space.
I assume this patch is motivated just to make arch support easier
and not for RTAS compatibility reason.

I don't think this patch really makes sense.  I think we should mask
all possible vectors for msi and msi-x initially in the generic code
and then unmask them.
If we were trying to support Dave Miller's example of hypervisors
that don't let us touch the msi registers I think there would be a
point.  As it is I think this just makes the code more brittle.
