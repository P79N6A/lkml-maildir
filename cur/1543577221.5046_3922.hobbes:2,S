I mark the page as reserved when I call ioremap and then unmark it after
ioremap returns, but iounmap will fail if it's still reserved (the same line of
code also checks the reserved bit):
 	if (!PageReserved(page) && atomic_dec_and_test(&page->count)) {
            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Is this what you're saying?
iounmap just calls vfree, which does all the work.  However, I'm confused at
this code in vfree:
	vmfree_area_pages(VMALLOC_VMADDR(tmp->addr), tmp->size);
	kfree(tmp);
What's the difference between vmfree_area_pages and kfree?
