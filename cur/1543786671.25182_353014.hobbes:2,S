I'm still a bit confused by how the pthread implementation fits
together. Correct me if the following is wrong, please:
Whenever the user wants to cancel a pthread, glibc eventually calls
{sys-}tgkill() upon the given thread, causing the kernel to return EINTR
to the blocking system call, in this case epoll_wait(). It is glibc's
job to catch this return value and realize that the thread is ready to be
killed, which it is not doing in the case of epoll_wait().
Or is the "current thread has been cancelled and should be killed" check
happening elsewhere / in some other way?
By the way, I already brought this up on the glibc mailing list (before
I sent it to LKML), and it seems they couldn't care less.
