It shouldn't change anything for IA64. GFP_DMA32 just becomes
an alias for your GFP_DMA.  On advantage is that drivers can
be now source level compatible between x86-64 and ia64 
for this (although they should be really using pci_alloc_consistent()
instead)

swiotlb is still needed even with GFP_DMA32. Just move it.
2.6.15 won't have it also.
