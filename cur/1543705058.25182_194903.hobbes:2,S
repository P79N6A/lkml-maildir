Hello,
Where is the sparse source? (AKA TSCT - The Silly C Tokenizer) There was
the BK repository at bk://kernel.bkbits.net/torvalds/sparse, now
unavailable and the ml owner-linux-sparse@vger.kernel.org seems dead.
There is other BK rep at bk://linux-dj.bkbits.net/sparse but it is an old
version. And I can't find it on google... Any pointers? TIA.
PS: This info should also be somewhere in the kernel docs...
Regards,
  Rui Saraiva
