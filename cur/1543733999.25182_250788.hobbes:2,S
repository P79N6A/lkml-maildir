 oh i get it.  
 
 is that like someone writing really poor quality code where
 you have two processes reading from the same socket, wot like
 you're not supposed to do?
 or are there real instances / times where you really _do_ want
 that sort of thing to happen (xinetd?)
 [btw the sk_socket->file thing isn't filled in on input packets,
  but you still get the packet.  arg.  how the heck does ip_queue
  get enough info???]
 ta,
 l.

around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
