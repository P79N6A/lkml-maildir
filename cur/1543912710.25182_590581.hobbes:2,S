This "orthogonal" argument is reserved for the cdrecord maintainer;
I cannot figure out what you mean by orthogonal. If A is orthogonal
to B and B is orthogonal to C, then A is parallel to C. If there are
more objects than dimensions, at least one pair of them is not
orthogonal. That is what orthogonal means to me ;-)
