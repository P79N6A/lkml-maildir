 although, nmi_watchdog=1 works well when this crazy module loaded
 may it be a hardware bug?  or maybe a usual thing that the low-level
drivers can put the hardware to such a situation when NMI's are stopped
or the nmi_die message can't get out?   (sorry for this newbie question
and thanks for your replies)
== nofuture.c:
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
int deadlock_init(void)
{
    local_irq_disable();
    while ("I want to loop!")
    ;
    return 0;
}
module_init(deadlock_init);
