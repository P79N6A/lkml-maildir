Yes, the P55T2P4 is a 430HX.
If it's any use to you I've copied down the boot messages that I get
with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX=y in 2.3.6
Configuring the kernel without CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX is fine as are
kernels <= 2.3.3 (I haven't used 2.3.[45]). It takes a power cycle
before the TM3200A(hdd) is even recognised by the BIOS after trying to
boot.
Any minor errors are the result of copying this by hand.
