I'm seeing (hearing?) the same thing with my ES1371 card and the Alsa
driver atop pre7-ac6.  I had to put the mixer at 100% with the master
at about 75% to duplicate what I used to get with everything at 50%.
It is not so much that it is quieter, as that the dropoff is no longer
perceptively linear.  I'd guess it is closer to exponential now.
