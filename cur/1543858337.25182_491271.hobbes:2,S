Exposing the guts of the msr driver like that doesn't seem too clean.
For in-kernel use, why not just add something like this..
(note:not even compile tested)..
void rdmsr_on_cpu(unsigned int cpu, unsigned long msr, unsigned long *lo, unsigned long *hi)
{
    cpumask_t oldmask;
    oldmask = current->cpus_allowed;
    set_cpus_allowed(current, cpumask_of_cpu(cpu));
	rdmsr(msr, &lo, &hi);
    set_cpus_allowed(current, oldmask);
}
