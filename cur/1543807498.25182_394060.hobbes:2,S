Why do you need to catch keypress. Keypress generates interrupts which
are controlled by linux kernel. Then it transmits this character(s) to
the application. Hypothetically it is possible to setup some callback
with kernel so that whenver there is a keypress it handles it & then
invokes the call back. But I doubt if it is done currently.
