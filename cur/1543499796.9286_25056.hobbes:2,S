the currently discussed BSD-based idea is very slick,
but does not seem to deal with more than 2 or three partitions very well,
being oriented as it is around the interrelationships between the primary
and the secondary, not using some consistant model for ALL such
relationships.
The first method is prob easier to code,  however it does lead to some
problems so how about something similar:
		layers.  
(before you yell out "this is the same thing..." wait...)
there is a primary filesystem... by default it is the filesystem that
	owned the directory prior to the mount...
	ie given the first mount to /home, the root partition would be
	primary..
	this is overrideable using
	mount -p device # a new option to est primacy
	this can be switched by the mount-point owner by using programs like
		tune2fs, though a shell-script wrapper with a name like fslayer
	the point of being primary is that new files and dirs are by default
		created into this partition, and that in case of a file or dir
		having the same name, the primary partition one is 
		shown...
the other partitions are added in as a queue, with the order being the
	determinate of which one's files take precedence...
to switch order, one simply types 
	fslayer -l +1 devname to raise it one spot (ie from 4th to 3rd)
	fslayer -l -2 devname to move it in the other direction
	fslayer -l 1 devname to move it to the given position 
		(primary position is 0, -1 is absolute bottom,
		newly mounted drives will take precedence)
	optionally one can refer to the layers by their layer locations,
		rather than the fully qualified device name
	instead of
		fslayer -l +1 /dev/hda1
	one can use
		fslayer -l +1 _L4_
	(if someone, in another context, wants to refer to a file called
	_L4_, (a) they are smoking something
	      (b) they can put it in double quotes
			ie fslayer -whatever "_L4_" )
some may feel that the concept of a stack should be used rather than a
	queue... that the newest mount should by default take precedence...
	the arguement against this is that in this manner we are sure to
	prevent a change in the actions produced by binaries, etc.. unless
	we specifically want the primacy of the new dev... there are other
	security reasons as well
root can prevent the owner of a mount point from fooling around with the
	order by a fslayer -freeze...
optionally the order of partitions can be different for different
	directories... (optional in terms of implementation, this could be
	quite a headache to code...)
to move a given file from one layer to another, one types in
	mv (name of file) ._layerx/
	mv ._layer3/foo . #moves foo from the fs that is fourth from the
	top to the primary partition...
the white space idea extends to this proposal... one can 
	fslayer +ws (name of file/dir/whitespace)
		places a whitespace on the primary layer for the file..
	fslayer +ws (name-of-file) (layerid)
		places the whitespace on the given layer (layerid can be
			the fully qualified device name, or the builtin 
			reference shown earlier)
		placing a whitespace on a layer obscures only the layers
		beneath it.
	note that if the primary layer is given a whitespace and then it
		is moved, the whitespace goes with it, to whatever new 
		location.
	to place a "floating whitespace" that obscures a file if it does
	not exist in the top layer WHATEVER THAT MAY BE AT THE TIME
		fslayer +ws (a
now to say that partitions are ordered in a specific manner, but you want
some files from one part to rise or decend independant of the entire
partition...
	all of these flags, values etc are being kept for partitions... I
have to admit I am not sure where the currently discussed idea plans to
place them, but that same location can have values for files independant
of the partition value (performance for doing this could suck, but it prob
will only be done in circumstances where performance is not the primary
concern - that and implementation can be cleaned up, any ideas?) the
values being x.y notation to establish where exactly they are being
placed, relative to the partitions (and the -0.y is allowed, to allow
files to rise above the primary partition)
thoughts?
