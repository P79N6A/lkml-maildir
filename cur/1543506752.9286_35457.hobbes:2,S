Hmmm, ip_send() has changed since 2.0.xx....this is the sort of
solution I was hoping for!

I noticed this.  I used your ideas, but it oopsed on the udp/500 and
IPIP/0 cases, for which I kept the original code and only called the
ip_route_output() stuff for the changed packet.  It is still oopsing
occasionally.  Perhaps it is my platform?
The headroom issue is a little odd, I had a skb_put() panic without
it.

Right...

Thanks for the ideas...and time to study ipip.c some more.
