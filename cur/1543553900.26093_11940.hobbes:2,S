There is a variation of #2 that is often good enough, based on some research
work done at (among other places) the Oregon Graduate Center.  I don't have
the references handy, but you might want to look for papers on "sandboxing"
authored there.
The basic idea is similar to the one used by many 'recompile on the fly'
systems, and involves marking the code in such a way that even inline pieces
can be replaced on the fly.  Very useful for things like system specific
memcpy implementations.
