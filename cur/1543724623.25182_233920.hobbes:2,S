Your questions would be better addressed to Linux-PowerEdge@dell.com
(subscribe and read archives at 
http://lists.us.dell.com/
) and/or
taroon-list@redhat.com (subscribe and read archives at
http://listman.redhat.com/
).  People on either list will be glad to
assist you, while linux-kernel is for kernel development topics.
Thanks,
Matt
