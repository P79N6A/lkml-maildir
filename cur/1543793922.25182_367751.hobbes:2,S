Whenever I insert my Iomega Mini 1Gb USB key, I get a stream of 
ioctl_internal_command errors. The device works just fine (mounting, 
copying files, unmounting, etc), but the messages are annoying...

And this goes on and on...approx one message per second if hal is 
running, otherwise only the first two ioctl_internal_command messages 
are shown. I assume that hal is doing some kind of polling on the device 
which triggers the error message. What does the error mean and how do I 
fix it? I've seen some other posts on the list with similar error 
messages but found no answers...
