This lets me use a multihead console, which lets me
run two X workstations in one pc. Two (or more)
keyboards, mice and screens.  But only one
expensive mainboard, only one space-consuming case.
Great for home use, possibly at work too.
Those who care about clean code can enjoy
the separation of framebuffer and console too.
