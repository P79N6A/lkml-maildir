Don't worry about it. My concern was that if you used %P for PID
while /bin/ps uses %p, admins would find it harder to remember.

It seems harmless enough, and some people either prefer it or want
compatibility with whatever else they run. We wouldn't have code
for other names already if people didn't want it.
Long term, I think the whole core file idea needs to be tossed in
