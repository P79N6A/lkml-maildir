Great!  I think Matt Dobson said he was going to do something similar, but he 
got sidetracked (and iirc, ak also didn't like the idea).  FWIW, I like it, 
with the caveat that the node returned from pcibus_to_node may not have any 
memory or CPUs associated with it.

I don't know how these two got different names...

Seems like nodes should have a cpumap and PCI busses should have a node.

Yep, this would be nice to have.
