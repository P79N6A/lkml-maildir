Hi,
Imagine this:
1. two modules A and B.
2. B requires some data exported (and initialized!) by A.
3. both A and B can be compiled statically into the kernel if user so
wishes during "make xconfig".
4. both A and B use module_init()/exit() macros.
If both modules are compiled as modules or if A is statically linked then
there are no problems - A always preceedes B and B always has the required
structures ready (if both are modules - via depmod mechanism).
If, however, both A and B are compiled it the monolithic kernel, then it
is a matter of whose module_init() gets called first during do_initcalls()
loop. How deterministics is this? I presume it depends on the link order?
What should one do to the Makefiles to be  guaranteed to have A's init()
function closer to __initcall_start than that of module B? 
regards,
