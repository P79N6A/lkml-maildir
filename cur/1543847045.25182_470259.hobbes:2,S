I doubt that a lot. Eg. Again, if I close the lid I may want my USB
network cards be suspended or not and that decision might change several
times a day. It's a policy decision in many cases. And I'd not be happy
with being required to down the interfaces to do so. Suspension should
be as transparent as possible.
