The driver looks pretty good, for both 2.4 and 2.6.  And the listed
changes above sound OK.  I see the driver is smaller now.
May I respectfully request that you submit your driver update in the
form of multiple patches, one patch per email?  This is the normal
method of submitting changes to the Linux kernel.  For example, create
and send 8 patches to Andrew Morton for inclusion in the 2.6.x kernel.
Each patch is applied after the last one, in succeeding order.  Typical
email subjects would look like
[PATCH 1/8] cmpci: fix s/pdif out
[PATCH 2/8] cmpci: support 8338 4-channel
[PATCH 3/8] cmpci: s/pdif loop
etc.
Splitting up changes in this manner allows for better verification, and
makes it easier to narrow down bugs to a specific change.  Large "one
big patch" updates often solve many bugs, and then add a few new bugs.
Best regards and thanks,
	Jeff
