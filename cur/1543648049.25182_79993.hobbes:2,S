Subject: [PATCH] printk declaration bug

Hi Linus,
The attached patch removes a second, extraneous, and different declaration of
printk() from asm-i386/spinlock.h. The difference is that the main one (in
linux/kernel.h) is declared "asmlinkage" and is thus fixed to regparm(0). The
second one isn't.
