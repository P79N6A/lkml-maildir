James,
I'm working on add amd dual core LinuxBIOS support to our MB. So I can
change the apic id as I want.
When I lift the apic id for CPUS, if the bsp apicid is changed to 0x10, the
jiffies is not changing, So I have to leave to set BSP using apic id 0 in
LinuxBIOS. And lifting others to use 0x11.....
According to Andi, that would be one bug in kernel .....
Regards
YH
