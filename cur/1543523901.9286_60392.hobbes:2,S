More likely the problem in mount where it returned early, before smbmount
had actually mounted (or something like that). Try getting a new mount
from the latest util-linux at:
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/
Something like this should also fail:
% mount -t smbfs -o password=xyzzy //win/f /mnt/f; ls /mnt/f

Between 2 smbfs mounts on the same machine? To reuse your example:
% cp /mnt/d/bigfile /mnt/f/bigfile

The first problem yes, the second no. I tried to repeat it but I can't
(box is 2.2.15pre3).
