and  I wonder why offset 0x53 is set to 0xe2.
according to the PDF data sheet bit 0x20 set seems to indicae `UDMA33 PIO mode'
instead of `UDMA33 DMA mode' which seems to be what I'd like to use ?!
how can I clear this bit ?  it's specified to be `read-only', so how do I
disable PIO and enable DMA ?   or is this the wrong way to go ???
lower nibble of 0x53 seems to force `cycle time' to 4T while your setup example
in ide/via82cxxx.c seems to suggest that this should be 2T (0x0).
I'm using plain standard 33 MHz PCI, so I'd guess that 2T should be correct ?!
I tried to change register 0x53 to 0xe1 and 0xe0 and 0x62..0x60, but this 
didn't make any difference :-(
thanks for hint...
