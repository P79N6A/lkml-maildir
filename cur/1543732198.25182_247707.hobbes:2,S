Subject: f_ops flag to speed up compatible ioctls in linux kernel

Hello!
Currently, on the x86_64 architecture, its quite tricky to make
a char device ioctl work for an x86 executables.
In particular,
   1. there is a requirement that ioctl number is unique -
      which is hard to guarantee especially for out of kernel modules
   2. there's a performance huge overhead for each compat call - there's
      a hash lookup in a global hash inside a lock_kernel -
      and I think compat performance *is* important.
Further, adding a command to the ioctl suddenly requires changing
two places - registration code and ioctl itself.
However, if all ioctl commands for a specific device
are not passing around pointers and long longs,
(relatively common case), and sometimes even
if they are, this ioctl is 64/32 bit compatible -
so why isnt there a simple way to declare this fact?
Here's a patch that simply adds a flag field to f_ops
that will cause all ioctls to get forwarded directly to the
64 bit call.
If all ioctls are compatible for a character device, a flag just
has to be set there, before the device is registered.
