Page migration removes the reverse mapping for the old page and installs 
the mappings to the new page later. This means that the counters are taken 
care of.
try_to_unmap_one removes the mapping and decrements the zone counter.
remove_migration_pte adds the mapping to the new page and increments the 
relevant zone counter.
