The only bad consequence possible is that you possibly cannot create a file with
a given filename if someone else (remote user) could create at least 127 files
with a very special filename within the same directory. Usually, /etc/shadow and
all other important files either are created before any other user has access or
(if they are created later) belong to directories where only root may create
files in it.
