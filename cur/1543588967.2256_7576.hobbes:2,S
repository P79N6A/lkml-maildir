It seems like we need to implement down_timeout (and
down_timeout_interruptible) to fully flesh out the semaphore implementation.
It is difficult and inefficient to emulate this using wrapper functions, as
far as I can see.
Seems like this is a fairly standard interface to have for OS semaphores. We
have a prototype implementation, and could contribute this, if desired.
Thoughts?
