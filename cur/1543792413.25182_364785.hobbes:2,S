No.  The privateness is guaranteed by proc_check_root(), which is
similar, but not the same as check_mnt(), and wich restrict _access_
to other namespaces.
check_mnt() restricts operations on other namespaces if you _already_
have access to said namespace.  For example via a file descriptor sent
between two processes in different namespaces.
Also with ptrace() you can still access other process's namespace, so
proc_check_root() is also too strict (or ptrace() too lax).
