No, as you see from my patch I just change the spinlock implementation
to a queued one. I agree it doesn't make sense to add a new type of lock.

In most cases, no. For the uncontended case they should be about the
same. They have the same spinning behaviour. However there is a little
window where they might be a bit slower I think... actually perhaps I'm
wrong!
Currently if you have 4 CPUs spinning and the lock is released, all 4
CPU cachelines will be invalidated, then they will be loaded again, and
found to be 0, so they all try to atomic_dec_return the counter, each
one invalidating others' cachelines. 1 gets through.
With my queued locks, all 4 cachelines are invalidated and loaded, but
only one will be allowed to proceed, and there are 0 atomic operations
or stores of any kind.
So I take that back: our current spinlocks have a worse thundering herd
behaviour under contention than my queued ones. So I'll definitely
push the patch through.
