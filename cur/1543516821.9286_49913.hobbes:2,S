Ok. The problem was person with two keyboards (Geert?). X worked
nicely for him with PS/2 keyboard but some keys did not work when he
plugged in mac-style keyboard. It was because X did not expect to see
e0 prefixes and similar braindamage.
Notice that medium raw is essentially raw mode with braindamage
removed, and notice that we can not reasonably generate prefixes for
keyboards that are not braindamaged. Therefore raw mode exports things
like differences between PS/2 and USB keyboards to userland
applications. There is _one_ legitimate application of full raw mode
-- showkeys. Other applications really want medium raw.
