The 'patch set' I publish on LKML is artificially created from the perfmon
patch tarball. As such, it does not have the property yuo are talking about here.
There is no independence of each patch. They are all more or less nedeed to get
the kernel to compile.

This modification of oprofile was one to allow the user level oprofile daemon
to determine which kernel "implementation" of oprofile it is running on. This
way tool could transparently run on existing Oprofile and also on systems
with both perfmon and Oprofile.
Andi suggested that during a transition period, we let Oprofile and perfmon
co-exist as opposed to moving Oprofile on top of perfmon right away. I think this
is a good suggestion. As a consequence, I will remove this Oprofile extension.

Yes most likely.
thanks for your feedback.
