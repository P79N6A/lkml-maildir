Unix does not, never has, and never will end a text line with ' ' (a
space character) or with \t (a tab character).  Yet if I begin a shell
script with '#!/bin/sh ' or '#!/bin/sh\t', the training white space is
striped and /bin/sh gets exec'd.  Since \r has no special significance
to Unix, I'd expect it to be treated the same as any other whitespace
character -- it should be striped, and /bin/sh should get exec'd.
