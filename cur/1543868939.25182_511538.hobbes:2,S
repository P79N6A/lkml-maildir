Well, as a reference, the user-space equivalent is defined in SUSv3 as:
"The realloc() function shall change the size of the memory object
pointed to by ptr to the size specified by size."
I think it is reasonable to expect krealloc() to not waste too much
space if I, say, reallocate a 128 byte buffer to 32 bytes.

Not available in the slob allocator AFAIK but yeah, I'll add this
optimization to the slab version. Thanks Christoph.
