As an employee of SourceGear Corporation (also sponsoring the
AbiSource project), I can assure you that CVS is now receiving some 
additional development attention that it had not previously enjoyed.
Being GPLed software, CVS will continue to be available as free
software.  CVS should only get better in the near future as improvements 
and patches (some having been in the queue for more than one year) are 
applied to the tree.  Watch for new releases with improvments.
Not being on the CVS team, I'll take this chance to direct any 
further inquiries to Eric Sink (eric@sourcegear.com), who, I'm sure,
would be glad to answer any other questions you may have about CVS.
