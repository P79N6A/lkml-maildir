Ehh, since there is no proactive maintainer for SCSI, I don't have much
choice, do I?
SCSI has been maintainerless for the last few years. Right now three
people work on it to some degree (Doug Ledford, James Bottomley and you),
but I don't get timely patches, and neither does apparently anybody else.
Case in point: I was debugging some USB storage issues with Matthew Dharm
yesterday, and he sent me patches to the SCSI subsystem that he claims
were supposedly considered valid on the scsi mailing list back in May.
Guess what? I've not seen the patches from any of the three people I
consider closest to being maintainers.
So your "should go through the maintainer" complaint is obviously a bunch
of bull. Feel free to step up to the plate, but before you do, don't throw
rocks in glass houses.
