The problem is that when one CPU crashes in a SMP system and the NMI
watchdog is enabled, the others will continue receiving NMI from the
watchdog and will eventually also receive the NMI from the crashing CPU.
The NMI handler has to be able to process both adequately if we cannot
stop the NMI watchdog atomically. Even if we used such a flag we would
need to figure out the originator of the NMI.
