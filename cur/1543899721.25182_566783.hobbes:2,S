Hi,
ISTR participating in a similar discussion some time back, but ...
anyway, I don't like the change in semantics of smp_call_function()
being proposed here *at* *all* ...

I like the patch being originally proposed here. For the sake of
correctness, it is _compulsory_ to wrap a get_cpu() / put_cpu()
pair around calls to smp_call_function{_single} in any case,
so it makes sense to provide a function that does this wrapping
in itself, to reduce likelihood of bugs and also get rid of open-coding.
[ In fact I don't like the fact that for the UP case you're simply
executing the function locally without even checking that the
cpu argument passed is indeed == 0. We had discussed this
previously and you did mention that cpu == 0 for !SMP is
assumed to be true, but I don't see what we lose by asserting
that "trivial assumption" either. ]

I'm not sure what you mean by "fix" here, but if you're proposing
that we change smp_call_function() semantics to _include_ the
current CPU (and just run the given function locally also along
with the others -- and hence get rid of on_each_cpu) then I'm sorry
but I'll have to *violently* disagree with that. Please remember that
the current CPU _must_ be treated specially in a whole *lot* of
usage scenarios ...
Take smp_send_stop() for instance. We need to send a suicide
function:
for (;;)
        halt();
to all _other_ CPUs *only* -- it would be *insane* to include ourselves
(current CPU, current thread) and just execute this suicide function
_locally_ *in current thread* too.
OTOH, there are plenty of situations where we actually _want_ to
get some function executed on *each* CPU (_including_ the current
local CPU that is executing that thread) -- naturally on_each_cpu()
would make sense for those cases.
Both have their purposes -- both must co-exist.

Take the same example here -- let's say we want to send a
"for (;;) ;" kind of function to a specified CPU. Now let's say
by the time we've called smp_call_function_single() on that
target CPU, we're preempted out and then get rescheduled
on the target CPU itself. There, we begin executing the
smp_call_function_single() (as modified by Avi here with your
proposed changed semantics) and notice that we've landed
on the target CPU itself, execute the suicidal function
_locally_ *in current thread* itself, and ... well, I hope you
get the picture.
So my opinion is to go with the get_cpu() / put_cpu() wrapper
Avi is proposing here and keep smp_call_function{_single}
semantics unchanged. [ Also please remember that for
*correctness*, preemption needs to be disabled by the
_caller_ of smp_call_function{_single} functions, doing so
inside them is insufficient. ]
