Just today we were trying to transfer ~350GB from a shell of a machine
(running knopix, with a very small amount of installed software, and
absolutely no disk space left) holding 4 disks to our raid disks --
the only thing installed was ssh, with even rsh being a symlink to ssh
(I was going to remove a whole bunch of packages to free up some space
so I could install rsh, but they didn't let me - it took them long
enough to get it to "work" in the first place).
Problem was that rsync combined with ssh was reading/writing at about
2MB/sec, given the age of the CPU. That will take a day more than
they have.
To put it bluntly, ssh is a *shit* solution on a secured net where
people care about performance.
