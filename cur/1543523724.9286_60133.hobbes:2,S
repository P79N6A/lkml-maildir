The Sony FireWire chip is not supported.  They don't produce them
anymore however, and current Vaios all have OHCI chips (at least
AFAIK).  In general all current 1394 hardware can be expected to have
OHCI and with less propability PCILynx (for both there are drivers).
To find out if the Vaio in question really has an OHCI chip, take a
look at the inevitable installation of Windows in the store: the device
manager should either directly say OHCI compatible/compliant, at the
very least the driver names should give a clue (look for the string
"ohci" again).
