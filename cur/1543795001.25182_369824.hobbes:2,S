Me too. Plus on most drives a flush cache command on a drive with write
back caching disabled will succeed, not fail. t13 is about to mandate
that behaviour as well, and honestly I think this is the logical way to
implement it in a drive (the flush just becomes a noop).
So Tejun, where do we stand with this patch series? Any changes over
what you posted last week? I'd like to get this merged in the block
tree, get it in -mm and merged for 2.6.16 if things work out.
