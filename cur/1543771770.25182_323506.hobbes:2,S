May I see the DSDT? The Samsung P30 INIT method referenced in
asus_hotk_get_info() is not supposed to return anything, not even an empty
string. I believe the new ACPICA implicit return might be interfering. 
Here's the relevant part of what I based the code on:
Method (INIT, 1, NotSerialized)
{
    Store (One, ATKP)
    If (LNot (LLess (PCBV, 0x02)))
    {
        If (And (WBTF, 0x1F))
        {
            Or (WBTF, 0x20, WBTF)
        }
        And (WBTF, 0xE0, WBTF)
    }
    If (And (WBTF, 0x40))
    {
        If (And (WBTF, 0xBF))
        {
            WLED (0x81)
        }
        Else
        {
            WLED (0x80)
        }
    }
    Else
    {
        WLED (0x80)
    }
}
