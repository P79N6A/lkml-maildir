You had it all then - CONFIG_KEYBOARD_XTKBD isn't needed.

The old stuff and namely laptops is the most crazy where it comes to
compatibility in the keyboard area. So it may be the code fails for some

Can you please enable #define I8042_DEBUG_IO in i8042.h and ATKBD_DEBUG
in atkbd.c, recompile, and send me the relevant 'dmesg' of your boot

I'll try to fix the problem then.
