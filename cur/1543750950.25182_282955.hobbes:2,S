Yes - sorry. The first of these two semi-identical fragments
is from Alan and appeared in patch-2.6.9, two weeks after
the patch under discussion was made. So, the second half
can be dropped. Below a patch.

The use of current->euid comes from the use of current->euid in dummy.c
a few lines higher up in the same routine.
The use of CAP_SYS_ADMIN comes from the use of CAP_SYS_ADMIN in
commoncap.c a few lines higher up in the same routine.
I have no strong opinion about what is best.
