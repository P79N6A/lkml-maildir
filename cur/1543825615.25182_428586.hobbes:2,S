Yes, I was using kgdb to look at the stack audits I stored in
the thread structure.

On Solaris the problem was that the kernel stack was larger because tail
optimization was disabled with optimization disabled. I'm not having
a kgdb problem with i386, it seems that Vladimir is/was and Amit
suspected it being due to the AMD64 requiring largers stacks. Seems
plausible to me. I thought you might have thoughts on that.

What's the conflict with larger kernel stacks and a loadable (kgdb)
module? Like Andy Morton I prefer to avoid using modules when using
kgdb; so I wouldn't have run into a problem. 
I was suggesting larger stack space for the kernel, not kgdb. I agree
this case might be one where kgdb has caused the kernel to trip over 
the edge. I don't feel comfortable running on a kernel that running
that close to running out of stack space. Maybe that's just a personal
preference; I'm paranoid I guess. I like having rock solid systems and
wacking the stack isn't always detected. On SunOS we had a REDZONE but
last I check Linux didn't; has one been added? If it hasn't it might
be good to keep in mind having a CPU specific physical page available
when we grow into the REDZONE. Looked to me like the stack grows right
into the thread structure; might make a nice exploit for a linux root
kit.
Having loadable debuggers seems a bit high hopes, as 'we' haven't even
release linux with kgdb built into the Linux src yet.
