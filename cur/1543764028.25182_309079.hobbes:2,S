Ouch!

Doing so now.

Agreed.  The key here is that the buffer is locked before
journal_unmap_buffer() is called, so we can indeed rely on it being
safely on disk.

Right - the committing transaction can't be doing any more writes, and
the current transaction has explicitly told us to throw away its own
writes if we get here.  Unfiling the buffer should be safe.
