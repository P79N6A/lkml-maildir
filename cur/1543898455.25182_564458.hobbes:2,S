To some extent, I agree. I think the ideal solution would be to simply not 
schedule processes that are supposed to be frozen. But who wants to play with 
scheduler code? Not me!

Fuse depends on !PPC?

I assume you mean STD. The problem there is that Linus doesn't care about STD. 
If he did, I dare say he'd think through the issues more thoroughly than he 
apparently has.

Fully agree. But how do you stop things syncing while you're writing the image 
if you don't have a freezer or equivalent? (scheduler based, kexec.. they're 
all workarounds for this issue).
