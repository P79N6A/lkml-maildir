You cannot do that.  The kernel must be self contained.  The only way
for the kernel to access module code and data is for the module to
register that code and data when the module is loaded and for the
kernel to access the module via the registration list.
See any module that handles a filesystem.  sys_open() does not call the
module directly.  A module registers its file operations on load.  The
kernel (dentry_open) calls the module via f->f_op->open.
