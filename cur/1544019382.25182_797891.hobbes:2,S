Yes we could ... the catch is that the supported TLB page sizes go
up by multiples of 4.  So if 64K is not enough the next stop is
at 256K, then 1M, then 4M, and so on.
That's why I asked when we know what total amount of per-cpu memory
is needed.  CONFIG time or boot time is good, because allocating higher
order pages is easy at boot time.  Arbitrary run time is bad because
we might have difficulty allocating a high order page for every cpu.
