hi,
this is w.r.t. to the ipNetToMediaTable.
i am working on a project which requires me to add an entry to this table
through a UCD SNMP (4.1.2) manager.
i am currently using the foll. command:
snmpset -v 3 -u <my-user-name> -l authnopriv -a MD5 -A <my-key>
<my-agent-ip> .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22.1.2.3.172.16.5.6 x "00 a0 b0 c0 d0 ef" (some
MAC).
however, this is resulting in an error packet which says:
Error in Packet.
Reason: noCreation
i also tried the v2 version and i get a similar error (SNMPv2: creation not
allowed).
could some one please help me out as to where i am going wrong?
TIA,
ravi kiran.
