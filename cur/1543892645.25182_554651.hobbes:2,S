Hi;

First of all sorry for late reply.
For a while İstanbul is not really hot [~26 C] :) and yes fans are/seems 
working without a problem.

According to ACPI output;
[caglar@zangetsu][~]> cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/*
<setting not supported>
cooling mode:   passive
<polling disabled>
state:                   ok
temperature:             56 C
critical (S5):           105 C
passive:                 95 C: tc1=1 tc2=5 tsp=10 devices=0xc20deec8
105 C is critical for that CPU, for a while (this is why i reply late) i'm 
constantly monitoring the temprature under low and high load. 
Its in 50-70 C interval in normal usage/idle and 80-100 C interval under high 
load (compiling some applications, using cpuburn to test etc.), so seems it 
can handle overheating issues
But digging the kern.log shows some strange values also;
May 24 10:39:23 localhost kernel: [    0.000000] Detected 897.748 MHz 
processor. <--- 2.6.21.2-CFS-v14
...
May 30 00:59:11 localhost kernel: [    0.000000] Detected 898.726 MHz 
processor. <--- 2.6.21.2-CFS-v15
...
Jun  1 02:09:44 localhost kernel: [    0.000000] Detected 897.591 MHz 
processor. <--- 2.6.21.3-CFS-v15
...
And according to same log these slowdowns occured after i compiled/installed 
these kernel versions into system(cause these are the first appearence of 
this versions in kern.log). So as you said it seems definetly a overheating 
issue. I'll continue to test/monitor and report back if i can find anything. 
Thanks!
Cheers
