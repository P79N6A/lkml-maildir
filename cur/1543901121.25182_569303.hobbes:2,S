Since only unregister_kprobe() calls arch_remove_kprobe(), and only
after having removed the struct kprobe from the kprobes list (while the
kprobes mutex is held), I wonder if there is any need to hold the
kprobes mutex at all when calling arch_remove_kprobe(). It turns out
that only get_insn_slot()/free_insn_slot() (which is in
kernel/kprobes.c, but called from arch specific code) seems to really
use protection of this mutex.
Would it make sense to protect the kprobe_insn_pages list with a
new kprobe_insn_mutex, nestable in the kprobe_mutex ?
