Right!

Good suggestion.
Actually, I  have a  side issue with  input/i8042 related  things: The
keyboard on  my laptop worked  slightly different: On 2.4.*,  SysRq is
activated using a [Fn] key-combo,  which agrees with the keycap labels
on the  laptop keyboard.   After upgrading to  2.6, that  key-combo no
longer  works.  Instead,  I must  use Alt-PrintScreen  as the  key for
SysRq.  (And unfortunately, PrintScreen is a [Fn] combo on the laptop,
thus requiring press  3 keys at the same time for  SysRq, and a fourth
key to use  the various SysRq features.  Very  inconvenient.)  Is this
again due to some dirty translation processes down in the input layer?
Is  the input  layer always  assuming that  Alt-PrintScreen  == SysRq?
This is not always true.  Can the input layer be so configured that it
never tries  to interpret  the scancodes, but  pass them to  the upper
layers?
