Subject: [patch 00/10] Use struct path in struct nameidata
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This is a respin of the patch series Andreas posted last month. It leaves out
the restructuring of the intent which will be done at a later point in time.
There are three preparing patches that remove unneeded code IMHO. I haven't
got feedback from Takashi since he is on holiday. Please, can somebody else
acknowledge the changes?
Comments?
