Thanks for the review. 
I have a new patchset which will address most of your comments.

OK, I've added a reference to the Documentation/DMA-attributes.txt 
file.

To make the type that carries the attributes opaque, so that it 
could be expanded. It's a bitmap in the latest version.

No, it's gone from the next patchset.

You're right. Done.

OK, I've changed this to CONFIG_HAVE_DMA_ATTRS, selected in Kconfig.

Latest version uses BUG_ON().

I put a stub in, but dma_get_attr() is only used by arch-specific 
code, and only code that has CONFIG_HAVE_DMA_ATTRS set. 
dma_set_attr() is used by arch-independent code, so it has 
to be there whether CONFIG_HAVE_DMA_ATTRS is set or no.
