Subject: How to get around sb sound dependency?

When I try to load the via82cxxx sound driver as a module, the sb module
(a dependency) tries and fails to register generic SoundBlaster
hardware.  My driver never even gets a chance to register itself,
because the sb module fails to load.
What's the best way to work around this?  (output below)  Separate sb
core functions from generic sb driver?
Thanks,
	Jeff
