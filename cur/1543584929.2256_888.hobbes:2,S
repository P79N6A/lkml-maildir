Hello,
           I have a basic question. Can we build a PnP ISA driver in kernel
with ISAPNP kernel option enabled so that kernel PnP does the job of
allocating the resources for the driver. The problem being that the
/etc/isapnp.conf should be executed before the device driver. I tried this
and was unsuccessful but worked fine when the driver was compiled as a
module. I read somewhere that ISAPNP drivers with ISAPNP enabled in kernel
should only be build as modules so that we can keep the order of execution
. Is this true.? Have any one of you tried this .
Thanks & Regards
Shiju
