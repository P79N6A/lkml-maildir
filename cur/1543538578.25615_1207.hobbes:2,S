Hi -
May I ask if the reiserfs patch for the 2.40-test kernels is useable?  I know
the whole spiel about the 2.40-test2 kernels being development kernels but I
find them to be fairly stable for desktop use.   I currenty have a Mandrake 7.1
system with a ReiserFS root partition.  I want to run the newer  2.4.0-test
series of kernels because of the improve support for my IDE chipset but I need
to make sure that the patch won't trash my root file system altogether.  Please
don't take offense at my question since I know I am wading into deep water here.
Thanks.
