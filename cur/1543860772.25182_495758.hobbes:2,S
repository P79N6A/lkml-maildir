pci_request_regions reserves only BAR4/BAR5 in legacy mode because of the
fact the resources are mashed and eventually cleaare by the existing (pre
2.6.20-rc) PCI code. The new code does provide that guarantee which is
(unfortunately) precisely why you get the problem - because the combined
mode hack currently relies on it failing to do so.
