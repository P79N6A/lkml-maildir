Linus, guess I missed this part ... so before touch anything, I did
tried suspend-to-ram, and it works on console and in X.
And suspend-to-disk hangs, but I can still press and hold the power
button to power it off. Then upon powering on and resume, I get the
ugly green "console" screen. I can still type and move around.
Starting X runs fine. Ctrl-Alt-Del or switching back to console will
get back to the green screen.
Thanks,
Jeff.
