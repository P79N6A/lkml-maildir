Initio has been suspected broken even after all the bug fixes (I
actually said that in the last pull request).  We just couldn't get a
tester to confirm the suspicion.  The commits were for known issues but
it proved impossible to get any of the reporters to verify.
Could you direct this poster to linux-scsi and we'll see if we can
finger the root cause (which will be difficult to do without getting a
boot trace).
