hmm, maybe because they expect the output of the
preprocessed assembly code to have the prefix .s
instead of .asm (see gcc man page and play with
gcc -S)
GCC(1)                      GNU Tools                      GCC(1)
       .s    Assembler source; assemble
       .S    Assembler source; preprocess, assemble
