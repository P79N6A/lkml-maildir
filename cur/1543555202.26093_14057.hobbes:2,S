 What is this intended to fix?  Please revert it -- it breaks for i82489DX
APICs configured to the PIC mode upon boot -- local interrupt registers
are hardwired to 0x00010000 and cannot be changed when a local APIC is in
the software-disabled state (i.e. bit 8 of the spurious interrupt vector
register is cleared).  As a result no local interrupts get configured.
