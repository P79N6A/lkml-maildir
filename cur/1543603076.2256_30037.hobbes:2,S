no. Mozilla is a http-client, it sends requests to the Apache http-server
and it receives content produced by the server.
the netconsole-module box is a log-server that sends messages to the
log-client, which log content is produced by the netconsole-module box.
(right now it gets not requests from the client, but it will so in the
future.)
(and yes, occasionally Mozilla is the content server, think cookies ...)
