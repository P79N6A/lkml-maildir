ext3_get_parent() is IMHO the wrong place to fix this bug as it introduces
a lot of internals from htree into that function.  Instead, I think this
should be fixed in ext3_find_entry() as in the below patch.  This has the
added advantage that it works for any callers of ext3_find_entry() and not
just ext3_lookup_parent().
I thought I submitted this patch to l-k at one point, but now I can't find
any mention of that in the archives...
