*Especially* since there are a number of users (including myself) who  
have tendencies to go wandering around sysfs tinkering with the  
available values.  Not having seen this thread, I would have had no  
problem doing "echo -n 0 >enable" on some device thinking that it was  
a fairly standard way to turn off the power to my soundcard when I'm  
not using it, and likely result in a kernel panic because I suddenly  
disabled the BARs on the device out from under the driver.
