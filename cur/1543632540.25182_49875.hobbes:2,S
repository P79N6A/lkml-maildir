So will we soon be seeing a port of RTAI to a linux kernel module
which is implemented as a separate Adeos domain, allowing RTAI
apps to bypass US patent 5995745?  A quick glance over that
patent leaves me uncertain whether this indeed bypasses the
fundamental "invention" of a "process for running a general
purpose computer operating system using a real time operating
system".   It still looks to me like a real time operating system
(Adeos) running real time and non-real time tasks with a general
purpose operating system as one of the non-real time tasks...
Could you summarize (for non-lawyers such as myself) how this
bypasses the claims in the patent?  
Hopeful is,
 -Erik
