Since epoll does not have the concept of priority, that means that you 
have to scan the whole array of returned events anyway. It is sufficient 
that when you notice a POLLHUP, you do a quick handling with a simple 
epoll_ctl(DEL), append the fd to a lazy-handling queue, and take care of 
it when time comes.
