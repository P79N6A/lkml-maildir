Except for the part about a 1 buffer minimum -- otherwise a slow device
will still be able to throttle the system once its queue is full.

Yes and no: think of temporary files or even the bitmaps on a busy
filesystem.  If you order requests before doing LRU on them, these will
get flushed out to disk much more frequently than need under normal
circumstances.  It'll be nice once we have a filesystem that does safe
metadata ordering...
