Subject: [PATCH 01/14] debugfs: remove rmdir() non-empty complaint
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
This patch kills the pointless debugfs rmdir() printk() when called on a
non-empty directory. blktrace will sometimes have to call it a few times
when forcefully ending a trace, which polutes the log with pointless
warnings.
Rationale:
- It's more code to work-around this "problem" in the debugfs users, and
  you would have to add code to check for empty directories to do so (or
  assume that debugfs is using simple_ helpers, but that would be a
  layering violation).
- Other rmdir() implementations don't complain about something this
  silly.
