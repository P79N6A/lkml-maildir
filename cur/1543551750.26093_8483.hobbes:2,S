Not entirely... there's a patented little thing called "BurnProof" that
allows the drive to continue burning after exhausting the buffer.  And
if you look at the error most (some?) CD burners send on buffer underflow,
the error is "correctable". (Nothing ever _does_ correct it, tho')

Umm, doesn't cdrecord know how to address IDE devices directly?
