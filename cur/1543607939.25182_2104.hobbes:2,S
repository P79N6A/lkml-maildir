Davide, nice analysis.
I want to point out that some (not all) of the stuff is already done
in our scalable MQ scheduler (
http://lse.sourceforge.net/scheduling
).
What we have:
-------------
multiple queues, each protected by their own lock to avoid 
the contention.
Automatic Loadbalancing across all queues (yes, that creates overhead)
CPU pooling as configurable mean to get from isolated queues to a fully 
balanced (global scheduling decision) scheduler.
Also have some initial placement to the least loaded runqueue in the least
loaded pool
We look at this as a configurable infrastructure....
What we don't have:
-------------------
The removal of PROC_CHANGE_PENALTY with a time decay cache affinity definition.
At ALS: I will be reporting on our experience with what we have
for a 8-way system and a 4x4-way NUMA system (OSDL)
wrt early placement, choice of best pool size ?
Are you can get an early start at:
	
http://lse.sourceforge.net/scheduling/als2001/pmqs.ps
Are you going to be a ALS ? Maybe we can chat about what the pros and cons
of each approach are and whether we could/should merge things together.
I am very intriged by the "CPU History Weight" that I see as a major
add-on to our stuff. What I am not so keen about is the fact
you seem to only do load-balancing at fork and idle time.
In a loaded system that can lead to load inbalances
We do a periodic (configurable) call, which has also some drawbacks.
Another thing that needs to be thought about is the metric used
to determine <load> on a queue. For simplicity, runqueue length is
one indication, for fairness, maybe the sum of nice-value would be ok.
We experimented with both and didn't see to much of a difference, however
measuring fairness is difficult to do.
