I'm possibly messing things up here, but doesn't it generally make more 
sense to convert tq_immediate users to tasklets instead of work queues?
tq_immediate users do not need process context, and one use I'm familiar 
with is basically doing bottom half interrupt processing, e.g. in lots of 
places in the ISDN code. Introducing a context switch for no obvious gain 
there seems rather pointless to me?
The same may be true for the tq_timer users as well?
