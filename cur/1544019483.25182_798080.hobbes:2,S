Subject: [RFC PATCH 01/10] PCI: don't scan existing devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/407

pci_scan_slot is supposed to add newly discovered devices to
pci_bus->devices, but doesn't check to see if the device has
already been added. This can cause problems if we ever want
to use this interface to rescan the PCI bus.
