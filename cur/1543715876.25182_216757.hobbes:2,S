Let me spell it out.
You deceived users by circumventing a check designed to tell them that
their kernel was tainted.  You deceived maintainers who receive
"untainted" bug reports.  In a way, you lied directly to the kernel
community: the module code is our agent in checking module licenses.
That you've been doing it for a while, or that you didn't spend
significant time investigating alternatives or talking to the maintainer
about your problem only compounds the damage.  That I know and like you
only heightens my disappointment.
Hence I stand by my original comment:
	This shows a lack of integrity that I find personally repulsive.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
