There are some weird cases, like for example get_user_pages(), when
the pte takes a write fault and the page is modified, but the pte
doesn't become dirty, because the page is written through the kernel
mapping.
In the get_user_pages() case the page itself is dirtied, so your patch
probably doesn't break that.  But I'm not sure if there aren't similar
cases like that that the pte_write() check is taking care of.
And anyway if the dirty page tracking works correctly, your patch
won't optimize anything, since the pte will _only_ become writable if
the page was dirtied.
So in fact normally pte_dirty() and pte_write() should be equivalent,
except for some weird cases.
