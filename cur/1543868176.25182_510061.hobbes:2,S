Could you bisect it please?  The patches to suspect are
consolidate-generic_writepages-and-mpage_writepages.patch
consolidate-generic_writepages-and-mpage_writepages-tidy.patch
and
git-block.patch
So just do
	quilt pop factor-outstanding-i-o-error-handling-tidy.patch
and retest.  If that doesn't fail, do
	quilt push
	quilt push
and retest
For git-block, do
	quilt pop scsi-megaraid_sas-return-sync-cache-call-with-success.patch
and retest.  If that doesn't fail, do
	quilt push git-block-xfs-barriers-broke.patch
and retest.
