There are idle tasks per CPU. If there are runnable tasks and the
idle-task of a CPU is running it, it is not fully loaded at this
time.
No idle task is running, if all CPUs are fully loaded AFAIR.

So you suggest only one load balancer task jumping from CPU to
CPU. I misunderstood it. _Only_ chalking up could certainly done by
the idle tasks.
