By the way, this MCE indicates that the CPU integrated northbridge got a 
watchdog error indicating that a bus transaction timed out (presumably 
on the HyperTransport link). This likely indicates that the chipset 
failed to respond to a CPU read of that register. Obviously this is 
something we want to avoid causing..
