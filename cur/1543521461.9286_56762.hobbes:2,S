Actually, my experience is that a tftp client of any sort is MUCH larger
than the equivalent http client!!  (Don't look at wget, it's bloated.)
By the time you reimplement handshaking and flow control in the incredibly
primitive and slow tftp protocol, you have an order of magnitude more code
than if you had done it in tcp.
I made a ram disk setup that has just enough to bring up the network
and my httpget program.  The httpget program is about two pages stripped,
including a usage string.  It then proceeds to download all kinds of
extra stuff including a second ram disk and unpacks it with 
  httpget $NEXTURL | zcat |tar xvf -
I think tftp is the WRONG way to boot systems.  If you look at how the
original diskless Sun systems tftpbooted, you will realize they had
the right idea.  They tftp a teeny bootstrap program (less than 100k)
which has enough in it to NFS mount the root partition.  Then they load
the KERNEL from the nfsroot.
Loading the kernel via nfs is probably a bit overboard, but it does help
boot speed a lot.  On a busy network, loading a couple hundred K via tftp
can be very miserable.  On the same net, transfering a couple of M via
http flies.
