works for me. it isn't rock solid as in 2.4 but most times it resumes
without problems even using dma on ide controller (in 2.4 i should
disable dma before suspend and couldn't enable it later).

i guess it isn't exactly the problem. maybe there's no _developers_ with
time and skills to work on it. i would do it if i have enough skills.
when stock 2.6 comes out we'll have a lot of people complaining
about APM because there a lot of notebooks out there that still needs
it. including mine.
