It is also possible to look into window and count how many times sun
hides and shines... It is quite cloudy in Moscow though.
As Acrypto asynchronous crypto layer author I can use different hardware
crypto accelerators, but it is a topic for another discussion.

Specially for you :)
It does not have artifacts, but it's dispersion is wider than XOR one.
_Much_ wider, which tends to creation of some specially crafted source
distribution which ends up in totally broken fairness.
As usual folded and not folded versions behave exactly the same.

I want to confirm three things and one state:
1. Jenkins hash has some unacceptible artefacts in some source
address/port distributions, no matter if it has some law embedded or it
is (pseudo)-random set. 
If there are bugs, bugs exist.
2. If it does not have artifacts it has unacceptible dispersion.
3. It is 3 times slower than XOR one (28 seconds for XOR for 2^29
iterations vs. 101 seconds jhash nonfolded and 109 jhash folded on my AMD64
3500+ 2.2 Ghz desktop).
4. I believe it can be tuned or has some gaps inside refactoring logic,
which can be fixed, but as is it can not be used for fair hash creation.
