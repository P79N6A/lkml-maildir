Hi:
I am running Redhat Linux Enterprise version 4 update 4 on a dual-core 
4G memory machine.
There are many references on the web talking about increasing default 
user address space
to 3.5 G however lacking specific instrcutions. My questions:
1. What is the specific steps to be done for the kernel to support 3.5 G 
address space?
2. Do I need to re-compile kernel to make this happen? If so, any 
specific instruction?
thanks in advance.
P.S. Please cc to me (mzhao@lizotech-inc.com) to reply.
