Interprocess communication seems a useful abstraction. But I fail to
see by which leap of logic it follows that DSM is then a *necessary*
(in the mathematical sense of "necessary") part of that abstraction.
It might hypothetically be desirable, for implementation reasons, to
consider it a part of that abstraction. But that would be choice, not
necessity.

Is there hard data to back these numbers up, or are they pulled from
the hat? Is it a desire or a fact that DSM is a simple solution?

However, if (for the sake of argument) DSM is the wrong abstraction,
coding to it and then needing to rework the design to make use of DSM
while at the same time trying to factor out the assumption that
memory is really shared and distributed would be a waste of human
time.
