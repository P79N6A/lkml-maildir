Did you mean "nice -20"?  If so, that should have slowed X quite a bit.  
Try "nice 19" instead.
nice(1):
       Run  COMMAND  with an adjusted niceness, which affects process 
scheduling.  With no COMMAND, print the current  niceness.   Nicenesses  
range from -20 (most favorable scheduling) to 19 (least favorable).
