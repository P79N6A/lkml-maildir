Or even better, do it on the disk controller strapped to the
physical disk so you can hide the fact that CRCs add data
overhead for every block making them longer than 2^n and can
use a CRC with optimised for the type of errors most common
on the media.  Wait, that is where it is already being done.
What is apparently missing is better handling of the
uncorrectable errors.  Specifically the ability to pass the
errors and warnings up to the OS for evaluation and for the
OS to be able to request a block remap or to undo a block
remap.
I'd guess that most of Hans' errors are not coming from
spinning media but from tranmission errors on the HD cables
and system busses, and from undetected memory errors.
