For PIDTYPE_PID.  For sessions and process groups we don't always allocate them,
and attach_pid is fine.
There is a bit of oddness in the pid freeing case, in using an unhashed pid,
so cpu hotunplug might be a problem.  But you certainly shouldn't be running
into this.

I don't think so.  I'm pretty certain we aren't passing the necessary
clone flags to make that case work for idle threads, and in fact we aren't
even cloning from the idle task when we create additional idle threads
so I don't see how do_each_pid_thread could work better.
That said do_each_pid_thread appears to be a proper superset of
do_each_pid_task so it should not be harmful.
I am all for figuring out how to remove this special case if we can.
