I can see why he does it, but that doesn't answer the problem that the
code is messing up the sensible interface.

That bit is fine, but put the count in the resource structure. Then you
can pass a resource around as a meaningful self contained object. That
means you can pass them, ref count them and whatever else is needed.
(Remember if you krealloc a pnp resource you have to know *nobody* is
using the existing resource pointer at that moment, so you will need
locks attached to the resource as well - or RCU later)

You don't need to change the names - just the code. 
Lets split the problems I have with it into three areas
1.	Changes the interface to drivers but for no apparent reason in
part.
2.	Hides a lot of stuff in macros so we get peculiar un C like
assignments that hide the actual functionality. I want to *see* what is
going on when I touch the code not hide it, at least within the pnp layer
3.	Object lifetime and internal completeness - dev->res should
point to everything that is neccessary to manage the resource set. It
should be updatable in a consistent locked manner. That matters the
moment you do any dynamic reassignment of resources affecting a live
object, it matters the moment you want to do things like work with
resources cleanly without the device structure.
Now I would suggest that #2 and #3 actually matter right now. We can
argue about whether its called a wombat or banana and rename them any day
of the week.
What I would thus like to see is a patch set which
1.	Switches to krealloc resources internally and moves the
resource count sizes into the resource object but without hiding internal
detail in magic macros (macros for device side are good internal bad
generally). Nothing dynamic after setup *yet*
2.	Update any driver specific assumptions about resource walking
