Yep. I got it to return the correct hard disk size (17Gb) using  
lseek64 and
#define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
Here is what I did
-------------------------------------------------
#define _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
int main()
{
         int f;
         off64_t off=0;
         f = open("/dev/hda", O_RDONLY );
         if(f <= 0){
                 perror("open");
                 exit(0);
         }
         off = lseek64(f, 0, SEEK_SET);
         off = lseek64(f, 0, SEEK_END);
         perror("llseek");
         printf ("Size %lld\n", off);
         close(f);
         return 0;
}

Now this gives me a clue what Ted was referring to as binary search  
in e2fsprogs.
If nothing works this should work portably I guess.
Thanks
