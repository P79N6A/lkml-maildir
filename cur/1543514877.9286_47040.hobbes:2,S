Long ago in a timesharing system far, far away, TOPS-10 PIP would let you
create files with arbitrary bit-patterns for names using a funky octal
notation.  We had some fun speculating on whether anyone in the lab,
confronted with a file named *.*, would be dumb enough to enter DEL *.*
before realizing what he'd done. :-}
I actually needed this feature on one occasion, when something or other
had created a file whose name contained a period.  (Not the period
separating the name from the extension; this period was *in* the name.)

Quick!  What's the SIXBIT for period?
