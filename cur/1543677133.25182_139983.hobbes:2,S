I'm having total freezes with 2.5.69 in both my home laptop with a SiS650
chipset and in my machine at work with Intel Corp. 82845G/GL. Using X with
Gnome (RH9) the system will end up to a completely frozen state after a
random amount of time. This happens with almost no activity on the machine
that makes me thing to be not related to some kind of load. IRQ are
disabled and the IDE drive light remains on. I planned to debug the thing
but I didn't have time yet. I set up the NMI oopser and I need to do
something to get the dump since when the NMI trigger I'm in graphic mode.
I was thinking about LKCD. It has never happened in console mode so it
must be X/Gnome+2.5.69
