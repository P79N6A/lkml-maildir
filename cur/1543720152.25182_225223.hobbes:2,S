You can use selective self-tests on this drive.  You'll need smartmontools
version 5.31 or greater.  This will help you pin down the bad LBAs
quickly.

You have some unreadable disk sectors.

This is a very useful disk feature!

Your disk has already reallocated 15 bad sectors.

There are 13 unreadable disk sectors that the OS has tried to access, and
one additional unreadable disk sector found in an off-line scan.

This is a typical read that failed at LBA 227270007.

See 
http://smartmontools.sourceforge.net/BadBlockHowTo.txt
 for info on how
to locate and force reallocation of the bad sectors.  When you are done
you should be able to run a long self-test (-t long) with no errors found.
You can use selective self-tests (-t select,M-N) to help locate the bad
sectors.
