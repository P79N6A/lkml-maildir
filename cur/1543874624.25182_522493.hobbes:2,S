Not sure what you mean with "trapped casing", I thought we were talking about
the security from the software side, not the physical one?

Our emails crossed eachother, but if you read kernel RAM you can in general
also modify it, in which case the signature checking can be disabled.
The moment someone with advanced hardware cracking knowledge puts his hands
on your stuff you're screwed anyway. If you don't believe me, try getting
hard security guarantees from hardware vendors. ;-)

How do you want to get the thing secure with asymmetric encryption when you
can't protect the kernel? That "other data" is your kernel binary, on flash
or in RAM. So if you can't protect that adequately, then who are you kidding
with signed modules? And the moment you've covered that, you can as well use
symmetric encryption...
