| The patch, as such, is fine - not arguing against it, but as a matter
| of style; don't we usually prefer the "if (!foo)" form over "if (foo
| == NULL)" ??
I just don't wanna mess 'if (!ptr)' and 'if (ptr == NULL)'
in the procedure. Look at the code ;) Some procs in CIFS
_does_ use '!ptr' but others - 'ptr == NULL'. So in the
proc being patched 'if (ptr == NULL)' is assumed.
