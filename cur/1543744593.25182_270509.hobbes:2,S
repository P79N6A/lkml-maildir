You need the core i2c modules loaded.
$ lsmod

Subject: /proc/bus/i2c is missing
Hello
linux 2.6.8.1
I insmoded i2c-parport and pcf8591 modules and i2c-1 appeared in my /dev
(previously, only i2c-0 was there):
	clock@oberon:~$ ls /dev/i2* 
	/dev/i2c-0  /dev/i2c-1
	
	/dev/i2c:
	0  1
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/i2c says "You can
examine /proc/bus/i2c to see what number corresponds to which adapter."
I don't have any /proc/i2c:
	clock@oberon:~$ ls /proc/i2c
	ls: /proc/i2c: No such file or directory
However, I have /proc:
	clock@oberon:~$ ls /proc
	             devices      mtrr
	             diskstats    net
	             dma          partitions
	             driver       pci
	             execdomains  scsi
	             filesystems  self
	             fs           slabinfo
	             ide          stat
	             interrupts   swaps
	  [...]      iomem        sys
	             ioports      sysrq-trigger
	             irq          sysvipc
	             kallsyms     tty
	             kcore        uptime
	             kmsg         version
	             loadavg      vmstat
	             locks
	  buddyinfo  mdstat
	  bus        meminfo
	  cmdline    misc
	  config.gz  modules
	  cpuinfo    mounts
How can I make /proc/i2c appear?
