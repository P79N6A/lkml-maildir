BTW, there's another big issues with LSM:  so far all those hook
have no user in a mergeable shape.  For all other additions
there is a strong need to present something mergable but LSM
doesn't.  IMHO we should require a pointer to a module in mergaable
shape (i.e. certainly not selinux) for each new hook addition.
