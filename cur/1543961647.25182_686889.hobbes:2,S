umm, well,
a) as your machine still needed the ioctl code, we can assume that there
   are others out there.  So it's unclear that we _can_ delete it, or change
   its interfaces.
b) the rate of change in that code is very close to zero.  I'd say just let
   it be.  It's not a good use of one's time?
