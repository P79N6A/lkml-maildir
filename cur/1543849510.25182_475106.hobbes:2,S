The two gcc versions are the 4.1 (miscompiles) and 3.4 (OK) from Debian
unstable.  I had originally compiled it myself with gcc-4.1 because the
Debian libgl1-mesa-dri package didn't build i965_dri.so until I
submitted a build patch to them to have it built.  They released a new
package a few days ago with i965_dri.so included, presumably built with
the same gcc-4.1, the default cc on Debian unstable.
I had exactly the same problems with my own version and theirs.  I
rebuilt it again today with CC=gcc-3.4 and now everything works great.
I saved a copy of the old i965_dri.so, so I can verify in the next few
days that replacing it breaks things again.  Let me know if you want
copies of these files to examine.
