Yeah, I know. That was the easy bit.

Ok, since you're misunderstanding me, where do I find out which is 
which, ie CPUID 660 is an ... and CPUID 670 is an ...
Point me to some good place to find out and I'm happy.
I'll try looking on www.amd.com to see if I can find it myself :)

Right, all I'd need is a way to match these numbers to core names. :)
