Doable with arch. You can rename dirs and remove them, also files, and it 
will detect it generating a much smaller patchset. It all depends on the 
tagging you choose for files be it implicit -tags inside the file-, 
explicit -ci, co- or by name.

You chose what is source code with regular exps. Symlinks sure work, the 
rest not sure, but think so.
