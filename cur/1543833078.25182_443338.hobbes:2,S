With the serialized sequential fsync, is that essentially what I was
talking about earlier with slowly streaming dirty writes to disk when
the HDD is idle?  If that's the case, I don't see the advantage in having
lazy fsyncs except in situations where you want to keep the HDD spun down
as much as possible.  If you keep as much of the writes in RAM as you
would have if you used lazy fsyncs, then you get the same temporal
locality speed up, with the added advantages that you can clear the RAM
under memory pressure immediately and crashes result in lower likelyhood
of data loss than with lazy fsync.  I suppose it isn't a bad idea to give
people more options (unless you're a GNOME UI developer :-P), but at the
very least I think that slow streaming to disk would be a very wise
default option.
My CS focus is Human Interfaces, so I may be way out of my league here
with FSs, but I thought I'd still throw in my two cents.

I've been meaning to hose my laptop (assuming I fix one problem with my
desktop), so I am willing to help write Gentoo install docs (or possibly
Arch Linux).  I can also test exsiting instructions.
