Mounting the same fs many times _is_ perfectly legitimate. However, I really
don't like the fact that you've been able to do it several times on the same
mountpoint...  Ah. I see - Linus, could you please do the following?
vi drivers/usb/inode.c '-c/DECLARE_FSTYPE/s/0/FS_SINGLE/
x'
I.e. replace the last argument in declaration of usbdevfs with FS_SINGLE -
without that we get a new instance every time.
