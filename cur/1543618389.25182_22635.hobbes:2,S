my patch only supports the kt133/kx133 and kt266/kt266a chipset by now ...
maybe it supports the k133a chipset (not tested ... if it has the same
register layout as the kt133 it will work). i have some informations on
the sis735 ... but as far as i know the k7s5a (most common mobo woth
sis735) has some serios problems with the disconnect on STPGNT detect
function ... maybe i will add the sis735 to the patch but it will be a
littlebit risky i think :)
if i get additional informations on the other chipsets, i will add them to
