OK, a silly one in try_to_free_pages(), I think there are some
code paths where we can end up calling the thing, sleeping for
a bit on some lock and then ending up not having to do any work,
because another thread already did this. In that case, 'ret'
will be zero, so I've changed the code below ...
        if (!ret)
                out_of_memory();
... to the following:
        if (!ret && free_low(ALL_ZONES) > 0)
                out_of_memory();
This will be part of rmap-11 ;)
regards,
Rik
