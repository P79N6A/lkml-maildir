Hi
I am working on a device driver software for linux kernel version 2.4.19.
My driver is a loadable module and the size of the module executable is
approximately 1.4MB.
When I tried to load this module on x86, I didn't have any problems while
installing it. On MIPS (R5432) CPU, this is giving the following problems:
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for printk
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for printk
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for printk
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for alloc_etherdev
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for printk
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for printk
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for pci_enable_device
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for pci_set_dma_mask
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for printk
edge_mod.o: Relocation overflow of type 4 for pci_find_capability
.........................
Could anyone tell me what this problem could be? What is relocation
overflow of type 4? Where can I find the list of all the possible
relocation overflow types and their descriptions?
My module is not compiled using the options -fPIC. Would it make any
difference if I enable this option?
I have seen this following comment in modutils-2.4.12/obj/obj_mips.c
/* _gp_disp is a magic symbol for PIC which is not supported for
   the kernel and loadable modules.  */
So, I was thinking that -fPIC wouldn't help much. Am I right?
Any help in this regard would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you in advance.
regards
Madhavi.
