Except though that with kmalloc() it's indeed just a leak while in this 
case things might blow up violently if run_workqueue() later accesses a 
workqueue_struct (or work_struct) which is already gone as part of the 
modules' datasection, for example. That's to say, if I'm reading this 
right...
I have no idea about the module refcounting stuff. Is there a chance 
that create_workqueue() could increase a reference somewhere so that the 
module wouldn't be allowed to unload untill after a destroy_workqueue()?
Rene.
