For many applications, yes - but think about a file server for a moment.
99% of the data read from the RAID (or whatever) is really aimed at the
appropriate NIC - going via main memory would just slow things down.
Take a heavily laden webserver. With a nice intelligent NIC and RAID
controller, you might have the httpd write the header to this NIC, then
have the NIC and RAID controller handle the sendfile operation themselves
- without ever touching the OS with this data.

I'd agree with that, but I would want peripherals to be able to send data
to each other without touching the host memory - think about playing video
files with an accelerator (just pipe the files from disk to the
accelerator), music with an "intelligent" sound card (just pipe the music
to the card), video capture, file servers, CD burning...
Having an Ethernet-style point-to-point "network" (everything connected as
a star, with something intelligent in the middle to direct the data where
it needs to go) makes sense, but don't assume everything is heading for
the host's memory. DMA straight to/from a "switch" would be a nice
solution, though...
