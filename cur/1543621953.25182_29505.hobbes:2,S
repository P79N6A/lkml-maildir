I'm thinking: any decent compiler will inline this on its own, _without_
an inline keyword. So _don't_ use inline here.

Indeed. And handled by the null case of "no inline" used above - the
compiler will get this right if you leave out the inline keywords,
while adding it causes the above issue.

Wasn't that case #2? Inline when func < some small number of bytes?
