Currently sys_security is used to implement open_secure(), mkdir_secure(), etc 
which do this atomically.

SE Linux needs that functionality, but also it needs the ability to support 
file type automatic transition rules, for example when a program in fingerd_t 
domain creates a file in a directory of var_log_t then the file will have 
type var_log_fingerd_t.  But this doesn't require any extra system calls 
either.
What requires more system calls is the logrotate program which has to create 
new log files with the same security context as the log file it renamed.
I suggest that you check the archives for the full thread as it explains all 
this and more in detail.
