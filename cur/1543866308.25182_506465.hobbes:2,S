 So is kexec able to relocate this vmlinux? If kexec and Gujin do approximately
the same thing they should do it the same way. If you cannot get a PT_LOAD
section, maybe we can put a simple system in NOTE, or just create a
PT_LOAD16 if the linker accepts other values.
 I do not really like to relocate after vmlinux has been linked at a fixed address,
because I am not sure you can guess each address to relocate or not:
you can define permanent address in the linker file by simply "symbol = address"
and those should never be relocated. For instance the very high addresses
on ia32 may point to registers or FPU instead of memory, so may or may not
have to be relocated. I also would better like you not to relocate the real-mode
addresses.

  So in some exception handler, you detect something is wrong and then
 jump to a new kernel. Maybe this class of bug (DMA or hardware bit flipped)
 should be detected even without this double kernel environment, by running a
 CRC32 on the kernel text section in this exception handler, displayed that in
 the crash dump.

  IHMO if it is just capturing the memory, I would have a kernel without
 any modules (usb-storage drivers linked-in) and save to USB key the
 core. Automatically loading modules after the crash may be a problem.

 I do not want to break anything for fun. I need either a reason or a bug.

 It may be possible to do some kind of "ld -r -o vmlinux", but delaying
the decision where to run the kernel is just delaying: someone has to
decide, and even if Gujin do not decide It will ask the user who most
of the time will have no clue... and on which basis do you want the
bootloader to decide... maybe this SDRAM is faulty and usually the
SDRAM are 512 Mbytes so run the kernel at 512 + 16 Mbytes, but
only if there is more than 1024 Mbytes of SDRAM?
  Thanks,
  Etienne.
