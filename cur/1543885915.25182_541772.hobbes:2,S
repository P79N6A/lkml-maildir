No, because it seems that your debian scripts hide it (or log it somewhere
else). But if you do "make modules_install" from the kernel tree (as I did),
you get it.

This "sanscrit-like" language is an oops (in fact a kernel panic, but the
dump format is called an oops). It is what developers use to find bugs.
I see that you're using devfs. It is unfortunate for you that you're using
all the parts which are not reputed for their reliability :-/ I'm pretty
sure that initialization order matters here but you cannot interact much
with it, except by forcing some drivers to "=y".
Are you aware of any kernel version on which this config worked ? I'd
like to help you get the minimal working config, ie: the one with the
lower number of hard-linked drivers.

Do not worry about the hardware here. The problem lies in the
initialization path of some sensible drivers. Did you enable DEVFS for a
particular reason, or just because you enabled almost everything ? If the
later, then you should retry with it disabled. It's absolutely not certain
that it will work, but it may.
If you're pretty certain that you need DEVFS, then for a test, please
set a max of IDE options to YES instead of MODULE. At least all the ones
you need to boot on this system.
As I said, it's a tricky area, and it's for this reason that distros
enable IDE to YES as well as some other entries I don't have in mind.

Willy
