No, it's my mistake! :)
We were talking about two different patches. After reading your post, I tried 
a look up on reiser4 and 4KSTACKS got my attention. 
reiser4-parse-options-reduce-stack-usage.patch seems to fix the 4KSTACKS 
issue; perhaps you'll want to revert reiser4-4kstacks-fix.patch and test it.
Best regards,
Norberto
