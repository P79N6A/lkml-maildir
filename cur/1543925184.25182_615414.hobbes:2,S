You never state that you depend on the strict_goal patch either here or in
a leader mail. The usual way of getting peoples attention is to have three
mails. In your case it would be
[PATCH 0/2] Allocate vmemmap from highmem where possible
[PATCH 1/2] Strictly place bootmem allocations when requested
[PATCH 2/2] Allocate sparse vmemmap block above 4G on x86_64
Maybe you have gone through all this already and I'm coming so late that I
missed it all. If that is the case, sorry for the noise.

Wrong markup there I believe. The __meminit markup is for functions
that are needed at runtime when memory is hot-added or hot-removed.
Bootmem functions do not qualify. __init is sufficient.
The name is confusing as well. I don't know what a high node is, but I
think you mean alloc_bootmem_highmem  or alloc_bootmem_highmem_zone.
That in *itself* is confusing on x86_64 because the memory above 4GiB is
ZONE_NORMAL, not ZONE_HIGHMEM. Calling it alloc_bootmem_nondma() makes
it worse.
I think you need to rework this to have an arch-specific function
like arch_alloc_vmemmap_block() that by default allocates with
____alloc_bootmem_node() and otherwise uses an arch-specific function.
In this case, it would know to call __alloc_bootmem_core() with the proper
addressing limits.

More magic values, both the 4GiB address here and the magic "1" at the
end are problems.

Confusing. Your declaration here makes it look like a bootmem API
function but it is an arch-specific function that only exists for
x86-64. I know it gets overridden later when a weak symbol but the more
common approach is to have Kconfig define something like
ARCH_HIGHMEM_VMEMMAP and
#ifdef CONFIG_ARCH_HIGHMEM_VMEMMAP
extern void *alloc_bootmem_high_node(pg_data_t *pgdat,
                unsigned long size,
                unsigned long align);
#else
static inline void *alloc_bootmem_high_node(pg_data_t *pgdat,
		unsigned long size,
		unsigned long align) {
	return NULL;
}
#endif /* CONFIG_ARCH_HIGHMEM_VMEMMAP
It's be similar if you have an arch-specific callback for vmalloc block
allocations instead of extending the bootmem API.

If you had an arch-specific function, I guess this would turn into
	} else {
		return arch_vmemmap_alloc_block(...);
	}
