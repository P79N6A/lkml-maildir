Why?  No-one complained when I first put up my rewrite patches three years ago.

CONFIG_MMU=n.

vm_mm is never set to anything other than NULL if CONFIG_MMU=n and it doesn't
seem to be a problem.  I don't think anything in the mm/ directory is left that
looks at vm_mm once MMU support is disabled (in fact I've just checked, and I
can compile with vm_mm #ifdef'd out)

If you're worryied that you can't compile anything for NOMMU, an FRV compiler
is available, and a suitable NOMMU default config can be provided.
Alternatively, you can pick ARM, M68K, ...

I can if it makes you happier.  It's not strictly necessary, but it does make
the struct smaller which is good.
