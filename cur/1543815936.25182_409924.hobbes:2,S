It doesn't support LVDS or DVI yet but I'm hoping to make it go in
that direction, I've no LVDS h/w, and some chipsets have it integrated
and some don't, but this is a better basis for future work, and I'll
have no problems keeping it updated with fixes as they come from the
X.org driver... I'd like to get at least LVDS support working for
laptop users with these chipsets, getting DVI working is a bit more
work as there are external chips that need to be driven over i2c, so
I'll need to at least add i2c support to the i8xx driver. (I noticed
Sylvain has done some of this work before)..... I'd like to expose i2c
buses to userspace anyways....

I'd like to keep the git history if possible, so maybe we can pull
this tree into -mm and I can get it pulled by Linus later.
