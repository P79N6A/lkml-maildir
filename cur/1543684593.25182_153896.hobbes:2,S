What is the problematic workload?  Please describe it in great detail.

That comment has thus far proved to be wrong.

oh, is that the workload?
Send a copy of /proc/meminfo, captured when the badness is happening.  Also
/proc/slabinfo.
Probably you will find that all of the low memory is consumed by inodes and
dentries.  ext2 is particularly prone to this because its directory pages
are placed in highmem, and those pages can pin down the dentries (and hence
the inodes).  
So sigh.  It is a problem which has been solved for a year at least.  Try
running one of Andrea's kernels, from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4
The most important patch for you is 10_inode-highmem-2.
