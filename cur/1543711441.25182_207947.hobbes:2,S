Yeah, mainly the difference is communicating in the description of each 
word.
Anyway, what I described is how things work :)  For example, features 
that are always enabled in the drive are listed with both support and 
enabled bits set.  The driver sees that, and does not issue a 
set-features command, because it does not need to.

Well...  If you don't check the proper feature bits found in the spec, I 
blame the driver for ignoring the spec...  :)

?  When it was optional, there was a feature bit to test.  When it 
became mandantory, the feature bit to test stayed in there.  The feature 
bit is zero, otherwise.  Makes it possible to use "just test the bit" 
and have things Just Work(tm).  :)
