I think Evgeniy - you are right! For times of research _changing_ a lot
of things is almost a low. syslets are in test area and why should we
bound ourself in survey of best. If something in syslets is sucks so
lets change it as early as possible. Of course I mean no more interface
changing after some _commit_ point (and that should be Linus decision).
