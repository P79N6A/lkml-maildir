Hi,
I just installed the new 2.2.6 kernel ( i use 2.2.5 now )
But my system is not booting with the new kernel.
My environment:
Alpha Ruffian UX
RedHat 5.2 for Alpha
egcs-1.1.2
It stops right after the
"mounting disk in read-write mode"
I noticed that there is a new NCR SCSI driver (3.2. vs 3.1h)
can this be the problem ?
Regards
Max
