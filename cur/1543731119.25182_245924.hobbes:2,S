That's what the pci driver model forces you to do.  If you go around
behind the back of it, you get what you deserve :)
For stuff like this, the IDE drivers need to be changed to use the (what
is it, 4 years old now?) pci driver model.  There's no reason technical
why such a conversion hasn't happened yet, right?
