   Agreed. I also don't like the HZ/50 fixed thing. Better to enter
   quickack mode unconditionally when we get a tiny packet with PSH
   set. I am doing that here.
There is no way I will allow this change, because it only trades one
bug for another.  If you do quickack mode instead of HZ/50 you will
get performance problems when talking to SunOS and many other bsd4.3
derived stacks.
Now if you suggest to retain the quickack bit, but still use HZ/50
if it is not set, that is an acceptable change.
Later,
