There is so much SELinux code in here, it's really not making sense to
do this as separate work.

That sounds like a problem.  Ptrace can undermine that really easily.
Also bind mounts will give you a different sid for same exectuable, with
a possible way to get into interesting 'group' situation.

How do you keep from joining the group?

what do you do about ptrace, /proc/[pid]/mem, fd passing, bind mounts, /proc/self/mem, etc.

Sounds like the best solution.
