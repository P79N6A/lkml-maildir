I hesitated for a moment. These conditions are not entirely
equivalent and neither implies the other. But Manfreds
version is better. Many drivers have a write_room() that
only counts characters and the corresponding write() will fill
the buffer and only check tty->stopped before actually transmitting.
So write_room() is a better predictor.
