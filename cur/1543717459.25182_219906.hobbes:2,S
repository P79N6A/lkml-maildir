The easiest would be to update the ./configure script, and
have the syscall number as a parameter.  Quite possibly it
could just point to an appropriate file that would grep for 
__NR_kexec_load.  This does not prevent the recompile problem
but it does help a little.
On the issue of needing $BIGNUM testers, I see a small challenge.
kexec is near useless on an unstable kernel.  So it really needs
to get into a stable series or people will be fighting kernel
bugs so much that they won't be able to see kexec specific issues.
Possibly the sanest route is 2.7.early and then 2.6 at about
the same time.  At any point that kexec makes it into a mainline
kernel though the syscall number will be frozen and things will
get easier.
