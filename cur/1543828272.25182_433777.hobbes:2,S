No you misunderstand why I use it here. I am not doing priority inheritance at 
all; that comes with all sorts of risks and complexities. This is done purely 
to prevent SCHED_IDLEPRIO tasks from grabbing a mutex and then never getting 
scheduled due to IDLEPRIO semantics while another task is effectively starved 
waiting on that mutex. It is used in -ck only to convert SCHED_IDLEPRIO tasks 
to nice 19 SCHED_NORMAL tasks while they're holding mutexes to do this.
