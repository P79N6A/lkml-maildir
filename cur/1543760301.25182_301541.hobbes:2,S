people can and do have >2T filesystems now.  some people on x86 have
hit the 16TB limit and others are large still with 64-bit CPUs

for 32-bit CPUs

LBD is in 2.6.x and is required for >2TB but sometimes that means >1TB
or even smaller depending on the drivers
many drivers simply won't go above 2T even with CONFIG_LBD so you need
