Let's change that slightly:
# cat /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory 
0
# grep -A10 overcommit Documentation/proc.txt
overcommit_memory
   This file contains one value. The following algorithm is used to
   decide if there's enough memory: if the value of overcommit_memory
   is positive, then there's always enough memory. This is a useful
   feature, since programs often malloc() huge amounts of memory 'just
   in case', while they only use a small part of it. Leaving this
   value at 0 will lead to the failure of such a huge malloc(), when
   in fact the system has enough memory for the program to run.
   On the other hand, enabling this feature can cause you to run out
   of memory and thrash the system to death, so large and/or important
   servers will want to set this value to 0.
As you can see, overcommit defaults to off. Under such conditions, malloc
is supposed to fail gracefully if enough memory cannot be allocated.
However, you can quite happily allocate 1GB, so long as you allocate it in
chunks of memory smaller than your physical limit. I've included a short
demonstration program for this. On an empeg (8MB ram, no swap) this results
in:
# ./killmem
Allocating 256 amounts of 4MB == 1024MB                                         
Successful                                                                      
Filling block 0                                                                 
Filling block 1                                                                 
killmem: memory violation at pc=0x0200047c, lr=0x4005f7d8 (bad address=0x4065d000, code 1)
Bus error
Which is kind of not very graceful. On my PC, 128MB ram, ~133MB swap, it
gets as far as block 34 (136MB) before causes a complete lockup (not even
magic sysrq works) - which is also not very graceful. The empeg runs
2.2.12, the PC runs 2.3.30. A solution I've thought of would be to have
vm_enough_memory() (in mm/mmap.c) also take into account anonymous mmap
pages that are yet to be paged, which requires another global count such as
nr_pending_anon_pages.
Has anyone got any other solutions to this?
