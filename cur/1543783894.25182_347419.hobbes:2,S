Do I get it right, that, say, if I tell grub to load a kernel and specify 
"vga=xxx" on the kernel command line, grub will interpret it, issue some 
VESA BIOS calls and fill in the screen_info struct? If so, the card often 
supports several modes (VGA, SVGA, VESA, different resolutions, colour 
depths, etc.), right? So, which one will be chosen? Does it depend on the 
specific value I give to "vga="? How do I force VIDEO_TYPE_VLFB (VESA VGA 
in graphic mode) mopde then?
BTW, I didn't find any code in grub that sets up screen_info, or it's very 
well hidden:-)
Thanks
