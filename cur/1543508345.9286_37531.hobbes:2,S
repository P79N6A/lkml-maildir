Sending abort message to a device. 
For expamle, you would want to stop a scanner when it does unwanted and 
long operation without fail. (recent scanner is fast, though)
Adding message sending handle to SHT would not affect performance,
but it make mid-layer bigger...

I appreciate good advise. Thanks.

Oh, sorry, I wanted to picture :

(Imagine wrapped old low has limited functionality but enough for sd.)
Ok, I am going to investigate CAM3 and FreeBSD CAM.
Thanks for advise!
