Storage of the capability bits isn't the hard part; that is especially
easy these days given the extensible security namespace for extended
attributes that was introduced for SELinux (but not limited to it).
# touch foo
# setfattr -n security.capability.effcap -v 0xdeadbeef foo
# getfattr -e hex -n security.capability.effcap foo
# file: foo
security.capability.effcap=0xdeadbeef
