Hi,
ext3-0.9.18 is now available for 2.4.19-pre8.  Some of the fixes in
this release are already in the 2.4.19-pre8, but there are some
important new fixes in the patch and users are encouraged to upgrade.
This release fixes all known outstanding bug reports.
The full patch against linux-2.4.19-pre8, and a tarball of the
individual fixes in this patch set, is now propagating to
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/sct/ext3/v2.4/
The full list of changes is included below.
Cheers,
 Stephen
