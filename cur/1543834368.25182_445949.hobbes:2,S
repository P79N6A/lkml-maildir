Hi,

My test build; standard kernel during bisection.

git bisect.

Applied.

Sure. The diff says:
 checking TSC synchronization across 4 CPUs:
+CPU#0 had 748437 usecs TSC skew, fixed it up.
+CPU#1 had 748437 usecs TSC skew, fixed it up.
+CPU#2 had -748437 usecs TSC skew, fixed it up.
+CPU#3 had -748437 usecs TSC skew, fixed it up.
 Brought up 4 CPUs
-migration_cost=4000,8000
+migration_cost=85,1724
... but apparently, that skew is not corrected.
These numbers do match the difference in observed "date" outputs.
