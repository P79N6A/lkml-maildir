perform the write after the failed read, that way the drive knows it is 
a bad block at the time you write.

I think I discussed with Vitaly offering users the option of writing, 
reading, and then writing again, every block before mkreiserfs.  I 
forget what happened to that idea, Vitaly?

I am not going to worry about such suspicions without evidence or drive 
manufacturer comment, as it has not been our experience so far.

There is a general problem with reporting urgent kernel messages to 
users thanks to GUIs covering over the console.
