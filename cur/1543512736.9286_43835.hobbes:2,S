Been there have done it already. However I would like to preffer just to
change
the note about the needed binutils, since this is what allmost all other 
platforms are really needing (ASM comes first to mind if I read the
ChangeLog's 
from binutils correctly). And anyway newer binutils are a real win
apparently
for everybody not just hacking on the kernel but writing user space code
too... (In esp C++)
