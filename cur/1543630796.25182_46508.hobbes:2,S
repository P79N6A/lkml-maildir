I tried sending this to linux-laptop and got no response, so I thought I try a
larger audience:
I am using 2.4.18 and have a Dell I8100 with 2 batteries.  If combined charge
of the batteries is less than 50% (according to the bios), then /proc/apm
shows the battery power level X 2.  If the combined charge of the batteries is
greater than 50%, then /proc/apm shows:
    1.16 1.2 0x03 0x01 0xff 0x10 -1% -1 ?
I think this is because the bogus calculation it would make would result in a
percentage > 100.
I took a quick look at arch/i386/kernel/apm.c but it wasn't obvious what to
do.
Does anyone else have any experience with this?
