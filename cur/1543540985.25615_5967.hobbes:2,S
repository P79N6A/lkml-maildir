The idea is that the memory_pressure variable indicates how
much page stealing is going on (on average) so every time
kswapd wakes up it knows how much pages to steal. That way
it should (if we're "lucky") free enough pages to get us
along until the next time kswapd wakes up.

The memory_pressure variable is there to ease this. If the load
is more or less bursty, but constant on a somewhat longer timescale
(say one minute), then we'll average the inactive_target to
somewhere between one and two seconds worth of page steals.

The algorithm we're using (dynamic inactive target w/
agressively trying to meet that target) will eat disk
bandwidth in the case of one application filling memory
really fast but not swapping, but since the data is
kept in memory, it shouldn't be a very big performance
penalty in most cases.
About NUMA scalability: we'll have different memory pools
per NUMA node. So if you have a 32-node, 64GB NUMA machine,
it'll partly function like 32 independant 2GB machines.
We'll have to find a solution for the pagecache_lock (how do
we make this more scalable?), but the pagecache_lru_lock, the
memory queues/lists and kswapd will be per _node_.
regards,
Rik
