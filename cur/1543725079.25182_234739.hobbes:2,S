Ok, but I wouldn't want to hurt the performance of small machines at all.  If 
possible, I'd rather just add another level to the hierarchy if MAX_NUMNODES

Would simply creating a 'supernode' scheduling domain work with the existing 
scheduler?  My thought was that in the ia64 code we'd create them for every N 
regular nodes; its children would be the regular nodes with the existing 
defaults.
