SMP kernel, non preempt, on a uniprocessor hyperthreaded CPU.

One idea was to just cache the file references over multiple syscalls and only
free them using a timer or when some thread calls close().
This would also avoid taking the spinlocks to set up the wait queues.
Then a new select or poll would just check if the input set matches
the caches and only fix up what changed.
But i didn't implement this because I would be quite a bit more complicated
instead of this simple patch.

Yes, epoll should have a similar effect.
