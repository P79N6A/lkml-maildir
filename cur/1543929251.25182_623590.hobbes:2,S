Delay accounting (or the /proc/<PID>/sched fields that i added recently) 
only get updated once a task has finished its unreasonably long delay 
and has scheduled. So lockups or extremely long delays _wont be 
detected_ this way. This is a debugging facility that clearly belongs 
into the kernel. Your arguments just make no objective sense.
