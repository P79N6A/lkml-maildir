It didn't make use of this value, it merely provided it for _drivers_ to
use. Driver passes in a max dma address, block layer translates that
into a page address. As for 4GB, see below.

Ok, I see where we are not seeing eye to eye. Really, I meant for the
PCI_MAX_DMA32 value to be 'Max address below 4GB' and not 'Max address
we can DMA to with 32-bit PCI'. Does that make sense? Maybe my
explanations weren't quite clear, and of course it didn't really help
that I shoved it in pci.h :-)

That's why I need you to sanity check the cross-platform stuff like
that :-). I see what you mean, point taken. Clearly I need to change the
blk_queue_bounce_limit stuff to check with the PCI capabilities.
