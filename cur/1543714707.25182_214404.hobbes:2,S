| yes. I'd like to see it this way:
| 
| Changes from version 2:
| 1.  Early Printk should not depend on EMBEDDED
| 2.  change "if foobar" to "depend on"
These mean the same thing to the config software, so I don't
care which way it's done.
| 3.  remove endif's superfluous because of 2.
| 4.  Move KALLSYMS some places lower
Then let's move KALLSYMS to the very end of the menu.
At the very least it should be after the last "depends on
DEBUG_KERNEL" entry, but it still interferes with that
dependency chain as either of us has it.
| 5.  Add some more "depend on DEBUG_KERNEL" to indent the menu
| 6.  Remove trailing new lines in some arch specific Kconfig.debug
| 7.  move depends on DEBUG_KERNEL for arch/m68k/Kconfig.debug to
|     the menu so you only see that menu if you select DEBUG_KERNEL
|     You can't select anything there if DEBUG_KERNEL is N.
Maybe do the same for parisc and s390, so that they don't show up
at all?
sparc is the same way:  only entry(s) depend on DEBUG_KERNEL.
Same for x86_64.
However, I did it that way for "future-proofing".  Makes it
easy for someone to add an entry without having to think about
higher-level parameters/values etc.
| 8.  Whitespace cleanups
| 
| Comments?
Yes... and you?
| Everything else is fine with me.
