Dear Sir or Madam,
We are trying to port a third party hardware driver into Linux kernel and 
this third party vendor does not allow us to publish the source code. Is 
there any approach that we can avoid publicizing the third party code while 
porting to Linux? Do we need to write some shim layer code in Linux kernel 
to interface the third party code? How can we do that? Is there any document 
or samples?
Thank you very much in advance,
GC
