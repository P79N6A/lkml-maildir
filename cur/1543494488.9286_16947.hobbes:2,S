Hi,
just some of my thoughts on the subject...

I think he have very well earned much respect by creating UNIX;
I would say he is one of the giants whose work made many nice things

While I have not read the interview in IEEE Computer yet, please let me
quote a fragment of earlier post:
"Thompson: I view Linux as something that's not Microsoft -- a backlash
against Microsoft, no more and no less.  I don't think it will be very
successful in the long run.  I've looked at the source, and there are
pieces that are good and pieces that are not.  A whole bunch of random
people have contributed to this source, and the quality varies
drastically.
"
So my understanding is that his opinions are based on reading Linux source
code, rather than looking at any badly configured Linux system.
And I would believe he knows what he is talking about, being one of the
principal authors of UNIX, no matter how much we could dislike
those opinions.
Maybe it would be much better for the Linux and its users we try to hear
and understand what he has to say (assuming he would want to talk with 
the Linux community;)
