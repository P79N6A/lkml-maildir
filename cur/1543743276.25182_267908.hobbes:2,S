Ok, this makes sense.
It's not, probably, a *bug* in the strict sense, but rather a missing feature. 
I've checked that to support sendfile on 2.6 kernels special help is needed 
from the FS (i.e., it must implement a special sendfile() function).
So, if you want to use httpd, either don't use in on hostfs, or use it on 2.4, 
or recompile apache disabling the usage of sendfile(). This is a new notice I 
get, however.
That said, there is a possibility the patch is just a one-liner. It seems 
there is generic support for this. Try the attached one. Report what happens, 
please, so I know what to do with it. If it works, it will be included in 
next release.

Ok, nothing new here.

Yes, this is exactly what happens.
