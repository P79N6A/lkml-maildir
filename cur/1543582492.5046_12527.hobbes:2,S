Subject: 2.4: maximum process size on i386?

 hello list,
   i apologize if this is way off-topic but noone i asked in my
 whereabounds would help: what is the maximum task size for 2.4.x on a
 i386 box and how do i change it (if possible)?
   i have processes that have to be really over 1gb (database engines) but
 unfortnately, when one reaches over 900mb kswapd starts eating 50+% of 1
 cpu and the whole thing gets slower.
   so i tried to decrease __PAGE_OFFSET in include/asm-i386/page.h to
 0x80000000 which as i learned should increase the task limit to ~2gb, but
 the kernel _won't even boot_ (halts right after lilo loads it, no output
 is written).
   the machine is 8xp3 xeon, 4gb ram, kernel 2.4.1-ac10, CONFIG_HIGHMEM
 and CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G are set.
    thank you for any help on this,
