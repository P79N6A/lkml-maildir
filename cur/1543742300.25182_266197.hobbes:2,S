Sorry, i386 is really a pool of Pentium, Athlon, and Opteron chips, with 
a witches brew of HT, 64bit extensions to 32 bit chips, and the like. 
Connected by a constantly changing set of Intel, SiS, VIA and other 
shipsets, and getting storage from IDE and SATA drives.
Not to mention using a vast array of CD and DVD drives and several major 
flavors of USB methods with minor variations of each, and driving their 
consoles with at least a half-dozen popular video chipsets with drivers 
of various shades of openness.
You don't even reach 99.99% with small-endian, there are more assorted 
RISC chips in use than that. I guess you're safe with twos complement 
arithmetic, although I cringed at Linus' recent "find a power of two" 
code which depends on it.  Diversity, thy name is Linux!
