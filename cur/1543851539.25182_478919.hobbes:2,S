that's for the 32 bit boundary. THe problem is that there are 31, 30, 28
and 26 bit devices as well, and those are in more trouble, and will
eventually fall back to GFP_DMA (inside the x86 PCI code; the driver
just uses the pci dma allocation routines) if they can't get suitable
memory otherwise....
It's all nice in theory. But then there is the reality that not all
devices are nice pci device that implement the entire spec;)
