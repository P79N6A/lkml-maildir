What I think what we should do is audit flush_icache_page coverage, and
convert ia64 to use that (because it needs this to happen _before_ the
pte is set).
All we should need to do is add a pte argument to flush_icache, and it
should be possible to do what ia64 wants, and we can remove
lazy_mmu_prot_update (or at least rename it to something like
flush_icache_page_chprot and move it to the normal flush_icache_page
position above set_pte if not all architectures want their
flush_icache_page called at protection change time).
