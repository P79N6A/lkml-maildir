I just built a simple 2.4.19 with gcc 3.0, and am writing from a warm boot
to it. The bletcherization of the kernel still hasn't completely killed
cLIeNUX. I do now have to run my pathname mungler on the kernel sources
themselves, which I didn't used to have to do, and make dep doesn't work
anyway, but make bzImage is almost hitch-free. 
You get a lot of questions about modules in make config after telling it
no modules. 
As usual I have a lot of drivers for things not on this box and all seems
rosy. It's big though. 900k without my usual "everything that doesn't kill
it", and of course, I boot an image with the System.map and .config
appended to the bzImage itself.
