Subject: [PATCH] nbd: Abort request on data reception failure
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/16/45

When reading from nbd device, we need to receive all the data after
receiving reply packet from the server - otherwise such request will
never be ended.
If socket is closed right after accepting reply control packet and in
the middle of waiting for read data, nbd_read_stat() returns NULL and
nbd_end_request() is not called.
This patch fixes it.
