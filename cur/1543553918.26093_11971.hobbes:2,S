Just to clarify.
The ONLY message from the IrDA people I've gotten during the last few
weeks has been a SINGLE email from Dag Brattli, with a 330kB patch.
The whole, full, unabridged explanation for those 330kB of patches:

That's it.
ONE message during the last month. ONE huge patch. From people who should
have known about 2.4.x being pending for some time. 
10,000+ lines of diff, with _no_ effort to split it up, or explain it with
anything but
	"o Fixes IrDA in 2.4"
and these people expect me to reply, sending long explanations of why I
don't like them? After they did nothing of the sort for the code they
claim should have been applied? Nada.
Get a grip.
