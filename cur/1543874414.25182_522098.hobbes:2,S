Of course, you have to first delete the corrupted file with this command:
	rm init/.missing_syscalls.h.cmd
The command :
	rm init/missing_syscalls.h
works only once, and you have to redo it at each compile.

This one is not necessary.

unlink the good file (init/.missing_syscalls.h.cmd), not the .h file,
and you won't need to redo it again :-)
I admit I should have said that earlier ;-)
The fact that whole init/ is not compiled again when init/Makefile is
perhaps a bug, but it is unrelated to this bug/patch.
Thanks.
