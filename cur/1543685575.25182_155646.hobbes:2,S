Couldn't each config option simply have a flags byte, thus:
00000000
||||||||
|||||||\ Not applicable to servers
||||||\- Not applicable to desktops
|||||\-- Not applicable to embedded systems
||||\--- Not extensively tested by developers
|||\---- Not extensively tested by end users
||\----- Obsolete
|\------ Appears to compile, but known to be broken in a subtle way
\------- Does not copmile
Then we could just have a menu with:
[X] Exclude options not applicable to servers
[X] Exclude options not applicable to desktops
[X] Exclude options not applicable to embedded systems
[X] Exclude options not extensively tested by developers
[X] Exclude options not extensively tested by endusers *
[X] Exclude options marked as obsolete
[X] Exclude options which compile, but are actually broken
[X] Exclude non-compiling options
* I.E. what is currently CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL
The flags byte could be optional, with a default value of 0.
Seems more practical than using config options, and it would make some
interesting statistics easily available.
