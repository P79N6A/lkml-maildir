I would also be in favour of having a more generic interface for
something like this (as opposed to each architecture rolling their own).
For example, sh currently has a very simplistic framework in place where
LED manipulation is done via a heartbeat callback in the machvec for each
timer tick, so it would be nice to have things somewhat more flexible in
this regard (especially for boards with multi-coloured LEDs, and for
userspace input).
