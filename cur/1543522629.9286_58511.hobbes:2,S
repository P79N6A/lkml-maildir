environment to any other user, under *all* circumstances. 
it's about time you guys acknowledged that app programmers cannot be 
trusted to do the right thing, and that security needs to be enforced at 
the kernel level, as far as is possible. I don't believe this will add 
great complexity to the kernel.
in fact, /etc/initscript can be used to accomplish adequate limit control, 
but there is no way to specify individual users with it....it affects 
all processes.
to say that the kernel is "enforcing" limits, when the *app* must initiate
the setrlimit  call is totally bogus.
