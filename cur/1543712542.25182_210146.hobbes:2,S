Ok, I got it. However, maybe this can be better solved by introducing a
feature, that enables to create snapshots in the form of pairs: 
 (name, version). After one has such snapshot info retrieved, one can
unlock the tree and read the rest without locks, only by specifying the
version of the resource (i.e., file in this case) in addition to its name.
Or, without such snapshot feature, after reading the entire tree unlocked,
check the versions of retrieved files and search for new/newer files, and
repeat pulling only for them. And so on.
But I think snapshot-info is more elegant and less error prone solution.
The second way is more resource demanding, imho.
