Onto my unwritten todo list with them.  The next lazy afternoon will
come for sure.
Etiennes code sounds promising as well.  Will have a closer look one
of those afternoons.  If it does fit the description, it might be a
good alternative for those platforms it happens to run on.
On a whole, I think it is better to leave most changes out of
mainline until 2.7 is opened.  At least, unless someone comes up with
an extensive test suite for correctness, throughput and interactivity.
Volunteers? ;)
