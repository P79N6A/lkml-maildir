Not me, a MTA 4 hops away on the way to me.
And not on _every_ message, it is more like "randomly one out of 
100 messages gets an 451 4.3.2 system not accepting network messages".
That's a perfectly legal behaviour considering that RFC 3463 gives 
"immanent shutdown, excessive load, or system maintenance" (which are 
for the sending MTA equal to "random") as example causes for this 
response.
The problem is really that Zmailer on vger under some circumstances 
never retries to send these emails for days, on one occasion the emails 
bounced after 5 days without any retry.
