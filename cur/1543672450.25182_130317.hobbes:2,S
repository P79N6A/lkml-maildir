I had this error right today for the first time, but I can't be sure if it's 
the same error/reason. The error happenned with 2.5.68-mm4. The steps were:
1) I booted with 2.5.69, changed the lilo.conf to add an option, and "lilo 
- -c". Rebooted, but the LILO remained the same
2) I booted again into 2.5.69, "lilo -c", and the same as in 1)
3) I booted in 2.5.68-mm4, lilo -c... and I got the error message saying L 99 
99 99..
This has never happenned before with kernels up to 2.5.67 nor 2.4.x
