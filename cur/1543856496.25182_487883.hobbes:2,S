I'm a bit reluctant to go adding more tricky infrastructure (especially
100% undocumented infrastructure) on behalf of a single usage site in a
place as creepy as the VT ioctl code.
If we envisage future users of this infrastructure (and if it gets
documented) then OK.  Otherwise I'd rather just stick another bandaid into
the vt code.  Can we add some locking there, or change it to use a
task_struct* or something?
