If you consider firmware to be "part of the hardware", then it's no 
different from having a table of register values to write to a 
peripheral whose meaning just isn't documented anywhere.
Remember the big up-roar about how Sun would not release information to 
one of the BSD teams so that they could port to UltraSparc III?  Well, 
they'd given that information to a Linux developer, and you can look at 
the source code if you like, but it isn't MEANINGFUL in a way that lets 
someone examine it to understand it to be able to reimplement it for a 
different OS.
With the case of the firmware, since the code there is only meaningful 
to the hardware you load it into, and that code doesn't execute on the 
host processor, this may create a sort of conceptual barrier which 
insulates the firmware code from NEEDING to be "open source".
Or to put it another way, you might consider a hex representation of the 
firmware that is embedded in the kernel to be the "preferred form", and 
its license is no more relevant than the license applied to the Verilog 
source to an ASIC for which you DON'T have to load firmware.
Lawyers could have a great fun time with this.  :)
