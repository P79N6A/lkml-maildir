well, 2.5's scheduler bits were pretty much in flux in the past two months
or so, partly due to the preemption feature going in. And there are a
number of other changes in the pipeline as well. So what makes sense for
2.4 is Robert's plan: to backport O(1)+preempt once 2.5 is slowing down,
that way we get the proper testing of both components, instead of a
separated scheduler patch that doesnt even exist in that form in 2.5.
