I've played with it and rebuilt all of Ark Linux (around 5000 packages) with 
glibc-kernheaders replaced with make headerinstall-ed headers, no problems at 
all (except some stupid apps thinking BITS_PER_LONG is supposed to be 
defined, but they were probably broken with the last couple of 
glibc-kernheaders releases as well).
So from a user's perspective, it's ready.
