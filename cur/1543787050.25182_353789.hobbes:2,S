Eh?!!!
Do systems with Local APIC still have IRQ lines going to the CPU?
How does PCI IRQ line otherwise generate an interrupt?

Ok - That sounds right for x86 and is true for ia64.
parisc has IO SAPICs but no local APIC.
parisc and (IIRC) alpha has the functional equivalent of Local APIC
but the implementation details are different. ie they can't share
code with x86/ia64.
thanks,
