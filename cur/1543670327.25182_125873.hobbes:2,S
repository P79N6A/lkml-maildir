I suspect there are better solutions; namely another host running 
something like passlogd with the xmit wires cut and the hosts sending 
udp broadcast messages (or plug it into the monitor port of the switch). 
  Also, since the poster was running Woody, apt-cron'ing security might 
also lend itself to usefulness, along with apt-listchanges and maybe a 
little expect script.
