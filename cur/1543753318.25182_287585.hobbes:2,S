It is rather unlikely that (flags | MS_RDONLY) == 0 ...
I don't like the 20 - so arbitrary.
And since we are going to panic anyway, why not wait indefinitely?
Suppose we have kernel command line options
	rootdev=, rootpttype=, root=, rootfstype=, rootwait=
telling the kernel what device is the root device,
what type of partition table it has,
on which partition the root filesystem lives,
what type of filesystem it has,
and whether we want to wait until it becomes available instead of panicking.
If we wait, possibly after the first failure to mount, do a printk
to tell the user: waiting for device to become available.
rootwait can have several values: for example, with a boot/root floppy combo,
we want the user to hit enter or so before accessing the device.
