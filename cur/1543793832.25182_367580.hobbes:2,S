Sorry but it has been always like that,
other requests also pass through ide_end_request()
(which of course needs fixing).

Agreed.

This is a very good idea.

We should get rid of ide_preempt later.
This will also allow us to remove ide_do_drive_cmd()
and use blk_execute_rq() exclusively.

Sounds good.
