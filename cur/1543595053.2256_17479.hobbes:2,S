Actually, what will happen is that when the symbol goes active and I know 
about it, I'll add a declaration to the symbols table.  Then, if I've
forgotten that I had the symbol on my ignore list, I'll get a compilation
error the next time I try to builsd a rulebase.

A ``decay in the social contract'' is detectable; there is a growing
feeling, particularly among middle-income taxpayers, that they are not
getting back, from society and government, their money's worth for
taxes paid. The tendency is for taxpayers to try to take more control
