such an interface should be defined with source visibility of both sides
though. At least of one user. Can XEN or any of the other open
hypervisors use this? What does it look like? And if not, why not,
wouldn't that make VMA a VMwareInterface instead ? ;)
Why can't vmware use the Xen interface instead?
