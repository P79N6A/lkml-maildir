We are pleased to announce the 2.6.23.9-rt12 tree, which can be
downloaded from the location:
 
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/
Changes since 2.6.23.1-rt11
  - Ported to 2.6.23.9
  - Backported the RT balance code from our submissions to upstream
  - Now missing Gregory's CPU Prio patch (those that are interested
                in testing that, should contact Gregory (email above)
                and come back with numbers to convince us that this
                is worth it).
to build a 2.6.23.9-rt12 tree, the following patches should be applied:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.23.9.tar.bz2
 
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/projects/rt/patch-2.6.23.9-rt12.bz2
And like always, my RT version of Matt Mackall's ketchup will get this
for you nicely:
  
http://people.redhat.com/srostedt/rt/tools/ketchup-0.9.8-rt2
  Note: the "-rt2".  Michal Schmidt help point out and fix the fact
    that "ketchup -s 2.6-rt" and "ketchup 2.6-rt" were broken.
    I never used that feature, but now I will.
The broken out patches are also available.
