Thanks for the quick response.  I took your suggestion (a) and created
/etc/binfmt_misc, and set up a test in my rc.local to mount it and register my
usual entries there if /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc doesn't exist.  So now it works
with both 2.4.3-pre4 and 2.4.2-ac20.

Grr... OK, I've been an overoptimistic idiot and missed that ugliness.
Solutions:
     a) mount it on some real place. And write there to register
entries instead of the bogus /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
     b) add a couple of proc_mkdir() into fs/proc/root.c
That is, add
     proc_mkdir("sys/fs", 0):
     proc_mkdir("sys/fs/binfmt_misc", 0);
after the line that says
     proc_mkdir("sys", 0);
I would strongly recommend (a). In the long run we'll need to go that
way.
