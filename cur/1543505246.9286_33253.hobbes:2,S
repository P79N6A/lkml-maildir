I am wondering if it is possible to have a laptop computer with
some form of 10Mbit ethernet connection or faster that is
wireless and free of any form of line of sight connection as
well.
Example:  A person has a home LAN, and a laptop.  They would like
to wander around the house with the LAPTOP, and possibly outside,
but not far.  However, they'd like the LAPTOP to be connected to
the LAN all the time without wires and without line of sight with
infrared or whatnot.
Is this possible?  If so, does Linux support it?  Where can I get
the info?
Thanks in advance!
TTYL
