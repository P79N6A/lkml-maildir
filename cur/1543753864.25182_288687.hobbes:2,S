Pavel does your test system have a Local APIC? If so that may also explain 
why you didn't see a difference.
Tony, something like the following for oneshot should work, untested of 
course. Perhaps you could use that for the wakeup interrupt instead?
void setup_oneshot_apic_timer(unsigned int count)
{
	unsigned int lvtt, tmp_value;
	unsigned long flags;
	count *= calibration_result;
	local_irq_save(flags);
	lvtt = ~APIC_LVT_TIMER_PERIODIC | LOCAL_TIMER_VECTOR;
	apic_write_around(APIC_LVTT, lvtt);
	tmp_value = apic_read(APIC_TDCR);
	apic_write_around(APIC_TDCR, (tmp_value
			& ~(APIC_TDR_DIV_1 | APIC_TDR_DIV_TMBASE))
			| APIC_TDR_DIV_16);
	apic_write_around(APIC_TMICT, count/APIC_DIVISOR);
	local_irq_restore(flags);
}
