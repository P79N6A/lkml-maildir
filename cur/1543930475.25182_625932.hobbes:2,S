This is correct behaviour. It checks the port is in legacy mode. If the
port is in legacy mode the BAR value is undefined and in some cases
completely random.

Then your quirk is faulty (for the general case). The BAR values are
undefined at that point, they may not even be writable.

Improbable unless its willing to rely on entirely undefined behaviour.
If you kick the device out of legacy mode (itself very very board
dependant) then you must find a suitable new resource allocation for the
controller.
