If the essence of using virtual machines is precisely that the machine
acts just as if it was a real hardware one, then we should not need
any modifications to the kernel. So, it would be much better if the
hypervirsor was completely transparent and just emulated a native cpu
and a common native set of hardware, which would then work 100% with
the native code in the kernel. This keeps the smarts of virtual
machine management on the hypervisor.
For example, TBL and pagetable handling can be done with 2 interfaces,
one standard via intercepting normal cpu instructions, and a batched
one via a hardware driver with a FIFO on shared memory just like many
graphics card do to send commands and data to the GPU. I recall this
design was the one used in the mac-on-linux hypervisor for ppc
architecture. Why not for x86 with vt/pacifica extensions? What about
using the same design than on the Sparc T1 port?
