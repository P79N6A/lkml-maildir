Subject: [PATCH][2.5] kbuild-2.5 4/12: defkeymaps (2nd resend)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

kbuild-2.5 - defkeymap files (acorn, character devices, tc)
Here we have several files that were created by loadkeys.
You will need this patch in generic for kbuild-2.5.
You will need most other kbuild-2.5 patches, too!
The mailing list rejected this patch twice, I think it's due
to filter rules paranoia.
