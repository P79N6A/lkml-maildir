This is a good explanation of why Linux may fail as a project, but it is
pure fantasy as to how it has so far succeded as a project. 
The tiny part of system I wrote directly and the larger part that
I got to see up close involved a great deal of design, old fashioned 
careful engineering, and even aesthetic principles of what wasgood
design. 
Don't drink the cool aid. Go back and look in the kernel archives and 
you will see extensive design discussions among all the core developers.
Linus has a point about the development of Linux not being in
accord with some master plan (at least not one anyone admits to) , but 
that's about as far as it goes.
