Looks nice, I know, but it may mean file handles are indirect, in that you
have:
  struct file->struct dentry->struct inode->struct winefile->struct file->...
if you can't store all the extra wine attributes on the struct file. It also
means that the inode or the dentry has to maintain a list of attached file's,
which I don't think it does at the moment.

Hmmm... worth investigating. I take it that this was only done for IRIX, not
Linux.

Probably do...

66%... Don't forget LockFile/UnlockFile. These work very similarly to fcntl,
I think, but demand mandatory locking.

I agree, but does Linus?

Probably, but unless the code goes into the kernel proper, patch maintainance
can be a real nightmare. The greater the amount of kernel actually changed by
a patch, the worse it is.

Not necessarily. For file handles, you probably should (unless you want
drive-letter mappings to occur in the kernel - yuk), but the other things are
effectively in separate namespaces.

You misunderstand me... _Using_ this API will not be mandatory, whether or not
it exists in the kernel proper.

knfsd? But I agree, really. But what is the likelyhood?

True... that smacks of MS policy:-)

Also true. You should be able to compile the module I currently have on all
Linux systems. Unfortunately, I can't test this at the moment.
