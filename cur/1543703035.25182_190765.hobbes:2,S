Indeed, enterprise class products based on 2.4.x kernels will need
some form of solution here too.

Ideally in 2.6 one can use device mapper, but DM hasn't been
incorporated into 2.4 stock, I know it's not in RHEL 3, and I don't
believe it's included in SLES8.  Can anyone share thoughts on if a DDF
solution were built on top of DM, that DM could be included in 2.4
stock, RHEL3, or SLES8?  Otherwise, Adaptec will be stuck with two
different solutions anyhow, one for 2.4 (they're proposing enhancing
MD), and DM for 2.6.
Thanks,
Matt
