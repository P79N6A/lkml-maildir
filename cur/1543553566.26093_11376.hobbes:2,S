We don't need to backport of the full exclusive wait queues: we could do
the equivalent of the semaphore inside the kernel around just accept(). It
wouldn't be a generic thing, but it would fix the specific case of
accept().
Otherwise we're going to have old binaries of apache lying around forever
that do the wrong thing..
