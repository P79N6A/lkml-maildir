For AHCI, if you've enabled link power management then you've already 
disabled hotplug. We might as well power down unused phys in that case. 
Note that laptop bays still seem to tend to use platform-specific 
hotplug notification, even when they're sata - we'll get the hotplug 
notify for them even if the phy's powered down, so that case also needs 
to be handled.
