Plugging. Emphasis on task.

It isn't exactly that. I'm thinking per-task rather than per-queue might
be a better idea because a) you don't know what else is putting requests
on the queue, and b) the point where you wait is not always the best place
to unplug.

Yes, and I'm talking about per-task vs per-queue plugging (because I want
to get rid of the implicit unplug, because I want to make lock_page & co
nicer).

I don't see what the problem is. Locks also suck if you forget to unlock
them.

Example?

Yes, you already said that, and I showed cases where that isn't optimal.
I don't know why you think this way of doing plugging is fundamentally
right and anything else must be wrong... it is always heuristic, isn't
it?
