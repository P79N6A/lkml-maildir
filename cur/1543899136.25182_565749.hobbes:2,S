Good idea.
I sometimes think we could have avoided _much_ trouble
if that had been always default for processes running 
in kernel space.

It seems strange to have a new interface for this. We already 
have get_cpu()/put_cpu(). So why not use that?

Can you turn preempt_count into a short first and use a short? That should be enough
and cache line usage wouldn't be increased. That's ok on x86; on RISCs 
int might be faster
