I want to use the performance-monitoring counter overflow interrupt on
P6-family processors so I need a vector for it.  Looking at hw_irq.h there
doesn't appear to be space for a new vector without breaking the '2 vectors
per level' rule.  I am tempted to use the 0x40-0x4F level because there's
only one frequently used vector in that range.  Any other suggestions how to
assign this new vector?
