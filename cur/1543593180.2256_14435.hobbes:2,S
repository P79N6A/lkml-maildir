To answer one of your questions:  /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc is a directory, not a
file.  If you mean that this directory is present but empty, try this:
     mount -t binfmt_misc none /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc
and see if the register and status files appear in it.  If the directory isn't
there at all, make certain you have CONFIG_BINFMT_MISC=y in your .config file.
