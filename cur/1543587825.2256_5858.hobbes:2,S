Hello,
I have study the code in ip_masq.c, and
I found that icmp packet use 
source address, destination address, source port and
destination port to hash into masquerade table.
Do icmp packets have port information?
I have print the port information with printk,
but I can't find out the answer to this question.
Could you give me a hint? Thanks a lot.
Cheers,
Tom
