It's basically the same way that the init code uses it.  When
initialized, a struct page has it set.  In theory, an architecture could
decide to keep the bit set when it is doing online_pages().  However, I
don't think any do that today.  Nobody would really notice if we killed
that.  That check could probably instead be something like
page_is_ram().
