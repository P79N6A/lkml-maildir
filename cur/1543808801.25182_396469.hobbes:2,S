Let's assume a get_time() which simply returns xtime and so has a 
resolution of around TICK_NSEC. This means the real time when one calls 
get_time() is somewhere between xtime and xtime+TICK_NSEC. Assuming the 
real time is xtime+TICK_NSEC-1, get_time() will return xtime and a 
relative timer with TICK_NSEC-1 will expire immediately.
The old code did this correctly. For most hardware this is not a real 
issue, as the delivery time is larger than the clock resolution, but 
unless you can guarantee it's not an issue on _any_ supported hardware, 
this fix is needed. As I already said this can be better fixed as soon as 
we have a better clock abstraction, until then this is only restores the 
old behaviour.
bye, Roman
