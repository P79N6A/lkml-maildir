Hardly pretty and definately not perfect, but that's mostly because we
haven't solved the other problems yet.

That was not why we did it that way. We used ioctl's because there is no
way to apply USB semantics to file streams.

That was the plan, but unfortunately USB pipes aren't what you or I
would consider a pipe normally.
Take isochronous pipe's for instance. How would we apply that to a
normal file stream? Or an interrupt pipe?
Even bulk has issues because USB pipe's aren't necessarily streams, they
can packetized in the psuedo weird way that USB does things.
I'm all for seperating out each endpoint into a seperate file in your
/structured/name way since it's necessary for multi interface devices,
but we still have problems with sharing the default control pipe for
instance.

I don't like socket's since we do have a well bound set of endpoints. We
don't have 4 billion IP's with 64k ports to choose from. We have x
endpoints that the device tells us about ahead of time.

sendto() is the only reason I can think that socket's would be useful.
bulk pipes are more like a sequenced datagram transport than anything.
However, it still doesn't seem to apply cleanly to the other 3 types of
pipe type's.
Perhaps we can create some new families specifically for USB?

I think this is an excellent idea as well. Just USB is poor example
since the real problem with USB is not the naming, it's applying USB
semantics to file streams or sockets.
