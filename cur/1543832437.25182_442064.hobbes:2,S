The kernel version is a debian kernel source version 2.4.27-3 and it was
recompiled to support SMP, High Memory, etc. The application is SpamAssassin
version 3.1.1. It is possible there may be an app bug, however I do not know
this for certain. We have manipulated the configuration of the daemon to try and
aleviate the symptoms to no avail. We experience the issues if we use a mysql
backend for the bayes db or not. We are experiencing misbehavior in the
application in the sense of the time it takes for messages to be processed. It
normally takes tenths of a second to process incoming mail, however we notice
the processing time jump to over 10 seconds each time the run queue drops to 0
and then drops back down to tenths of a second when the queue fills back up.
