Incomplete dump, what it really means.. 
(davej@deviant:davej)$ ./a.out -b 2 -e 0xba -s 940040000000017a -a 0
Status: (186) Error IP valid
Restart IP invalid.
parsebank(2): 940040000000017a @ 0
	External tag parity error
	Correctable ECC error
	Address in addr register valid
	Error enabled in control register
	Memory heirarchy error
	Request: Generic error
	Transaction type : Generic
	Memory/IO : I/O
Looks like the L2 cache ECC checking spotted something going wrong,
and fixed it up. This can happen in cases where there is inadequate
cooling, power, or overclocking (or in rare circumstances, flaky CPUs)
