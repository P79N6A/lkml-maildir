In this particular case, I think a semaphore is unnecessary because
we just want out_of_memory() to return to its caller if an OOM kill
is already in progress (as opposed to waiting in out_of_memory() and
then starting a new OOM kill operation).  What I want to avoid is the
the following type of behavior:
    1.  Two processes (A and B) call out_of_memory() at roughly the
        same time and race for oom_kill_lock.  Let's say A wins and B
        is delayed.
    2.  Process A shoots some process and releases oom_kill_lock.
    3.  Process B now acquires oom_kill_lock and shoots another
        process.  However this isn't really what we want to do if
        the OOM kill done by A above freed enough memory to resolve
        the OOM condition.

Ok, I'll drop the wrappers.

Ok, I'll add a ->flags member to mm_struct and just use one bit for
the oom_notify value.  Then if other users of mm_struct need flag
bits for other things in the future they can all share ->flags.  I'll
rework my patches and repost shortly...
