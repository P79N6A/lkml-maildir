Once again it was very jerky come run-around-the-map time, though it
improved over time.
For me, still not as smooth as CFS was (especially the initial player
movement, which was the worst by far of any test so far)
I want to get some better numbers than plain fps though, the graph of
the numbers is more staircase-like in this test but what it doesn't
show is exactly what's going on.  I can assure you the framerates may
be similar but the gameplay isn't - and in this test 5fps difference
is meaningless since it jumps around a lot (especially during the
run-around) as you would expect with the different stuff needing to be
rendered.
