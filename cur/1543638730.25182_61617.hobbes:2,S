how about putting the onus on userspace to tell the kernel if/when it uses 
extensions that require FP state to be saved/restored?
if/when glibc starts using SSE2, it could then use these extensions.
could be as simple as user-space setting some bit somewhere.

it probably isn't worthwhile penalising all users of signal just for those 
few userspace apps that actually do use SSE2.
cheers,
