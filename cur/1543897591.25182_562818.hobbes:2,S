We did the many test with the new version driver and didn't encounter
that problem, but in certain cases, DMASETUP command packets from drive
to the controller are corrupted, and the controller issues an R_ERR to
the drive. Drives that comply with SATA spec will re-transmit the
corrupted packet and normal operation continues. However, some Maxtor
NCQ drives do not re-transmit the DMASETUP command packet, resulting in
software timeout for this command. So if you are using the Maxtor HD and
meet this problem,please don't enable the NCQ function.

Haven't reviewed in detail, but does look cleaner than the previous
version. Some people reported seeing some unrecognized FIS, etc. errors
with the previous version, have those been looked into/fixed?
