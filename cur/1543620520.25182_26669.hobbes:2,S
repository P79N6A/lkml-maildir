Here's the context: the preemption patch puts pressure on Linux to move
from BKL to semaphores and then it will be seen that semaphores need
to have dynamic priority inherit to sort-of-work, and then it will be seen
that read/write lock is a problem!

this is absolutely correct. However, once the decision has been made or
fallen into to go to a priority inherit scheme, Linux will find itself
in the same bind as Solaris.

Seem like the lock is simply grabbed way to far up.
