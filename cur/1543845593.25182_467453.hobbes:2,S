Yes, the idea of generic code and sysfs things can
remove the supportable issues as to complete different
user interface exposed in /proc/acpi/ by different
platform specific drivers such as ibm_acpi.c,
asus_acpi.c, and toshiba_acpi.c,....

Please take a look at drivers/video/backlight..
And here is a example to use backlight class for acpi video driver:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-acpi&m=115574087203605&w=2
Please let me know if you have any other ideas to consolidate the
platform specific drivers such as ibm_acpi.c ,asus_acpi.c, toshiba_acpi.c
panasonic_acpi.c, sony_acpi.c , msi s270.c .....
Thanks,
