I am getting a kernel oops with both these kernels as soon as it the
kernel loads the ide drivers (hd*)
I am using ALI1542 chipset, K6/2 500 cpu
I have tried progressively disabling various ide options (cramfs,
acls tcq etc) to no effect
I run ext3 compiled in
This is on a base of RH9 with updated modutils from rawhide.
The kernel apparrently compiles fine (no errors)
Anyone any ideas what could be the cause of this (2.5.66 worked on
this machine and runs 2.4.21 fine)
If its not a simple fix I will bugzilla it
