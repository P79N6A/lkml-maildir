Subject: Update for IBM Thinkpad X31 and T40 users wishing to use miniPCI wifi cards

IBM has a newish Atheros-based 802.11a/b/g card, model number 31P9701,
which works with the Thinkpad X31.  I received mine last night and got
the infamous error 1802 (card not authorized).
I unplugged the miniPCI card and updated the X31's BIOS to revision
2.04, version 1QET66WW, dated 2003/12/02.  (I believe you must still
have Windows available to do this.)  The system now boots happily, and
the madwifi driver drives the card OK for me under both 2.4 and 2.6.
I assume that the PCI whitelist of infamy is still in place in the
latest BIOS, but at least it now supports a modern wifi card model.
