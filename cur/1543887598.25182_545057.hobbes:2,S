Doesn't that make hrtimer_get_res() and its callers buggy since they
return this 1ns value which is not reflecting the correct clock event
capability ?
Another question about the output of '/proc/timer_list':
[...]
active timers:
 #0: <c03fde10>, tick_sched_timer, S:01
 # expires at 64696546875000 nsecs [in 2514469 nsecs]
 .expires_next   : 64696546875000 nsecs
[...]
Doesn't the 2 expire time lines give the same information ? If so,
couldn't we merge them into : ".expires_next   : 64696546875000 nsecs
[in 2514469 nsecs]" ?
Thanks
