At the moment, a host outside of kernel.org is actually better for
gitweb lurkers. (But I trust that kernel.org will get up to speed again
soon.)

IMO: Posting patches to linux1394-devel is a must for anything that is
meant to go to -mm or ultimately to mainline. In some cases, patches
should also be Cc'd to linux-kernel or specialized lists like linux-scsi
or linuxppc-dev etc. depending on the issue. I think linux1394-devel can
bear the additional traffic from this new development.
The question is whether you will post what you wrote, or if I will post
what I pulled from you...
