How about keeping track of the rate of thread creation and switching to the
above behaviour only after the rate exceeds a certain limit? After falling
below a second (lower) limit, the old behaviour may be re-established again.
Essentially, the choice of the limits would make it possible then to
distinguish between "letigimate" thread creation, e.g. to handle an incoming
burst of requests on some server, and the "too quick" case.
