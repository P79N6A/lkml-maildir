Overuse of anything is harmful.
So is underuse.

Slower is the wrong argument. Often threads make for a *much* cleaner  
design. I've actually implemented thread-like libraries for DOS just  
because of this.

Umm, Unix has more advanced IPC than exactly *which* other system? DOS?
I've yet to discover any advanced IPC in Unix. Old and clunky is a better  
description. (Of course, that doesn't mean certain other systems can't  
manage to do advanced and clunky.)
I wouldn't point to Win32 IPC as a shining example, but Unix could  
certainly learn a number of things from it.
If you thing Unix IPC is so great, then try to count the cases of *real*  
IPC (that is, more than just starting another process with output  
redirection) in your system. I'll be astonished if you need two digits.  
Let's see, there's X, there's the resolver, maybe there's a database like  
Postgresql, maybe you want to count POP3 or NNTP (incidentally, each of  
those uses *networking* to do IPC) - oh yes, screen or xterm or similar if  
you use it, at least that's using ptys. And there's device lockfiles and  
daemon pid files. That's about it.
Unix is great, but IPC is not why.
I've thought about what would be involved in writing something like the  
AppleEvent/AppleScript stuff - somewhat more reasonable, IMHO, than doing  
ORB stuff, with ILU or IDL. The first question is, what IPC mechanism do  
you base it on? How do programs find each other's communications ports  
(whatever those are implemented like)? There's not even a portable  
mechanism for enumerating processes, and there's nothing you can do with a  
pid except send a signal (which is lousy for IPC). So programs need to  
register somewhere. Either in some directory or with some server. Sure,  
that's all *possible* - but compare it with MacOS or Win32 (or, I'm sure,  
plenty of other systems), where of course you have a mechanism for  
enumerating processes, and where there's a standard event mechanism you  
can use for doing your IPC.
