Actually, I have just seen that cmpxchg64 and cmpxchg64_local are
doing exactly this and they are already implemented in asm-i386/system.h.
A quick test: I am doing clflush in a loop (substracting its time from the
following loops) to have a memory hit when I do cmpxchg. This is the
result of just the cmpxchg8b:
non locked cmpxchg8b: 583.37 cycles
locked cmpxchg8b: 650.48 cycles
rmw in 3 operations: 581.43 cycles
So the locked cmpxchg is 67 cycles slower than the non locked cmpxchg,
which fits with my 30 vs 90 cycles. rmw is a tiny bit faster than
cmpxchg8b (2 cycles), but nothing to call home about.
