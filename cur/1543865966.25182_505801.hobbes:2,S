Well, if you enable dynticks you should expect the number of timer irqs 
to go down. There's no problem here.

it's quite easy to explain: because of the new dynticks feature. Both 
'timer' and 'LOC' counts go way down.

they are already listed in /proc/interrupts, depending on how they use 
interrupts. For a more complete list of in-use clockevent drivers see 
/proc/timer_info. But it would be wrong to touch /proc/interrupts to 
create some special-case for clockevents.
