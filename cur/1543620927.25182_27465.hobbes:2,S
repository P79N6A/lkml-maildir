We cross-compile all the time and don't have to parse assembler-files,
just compile a c-file and include the resulting asm into entry.S:
/* linux/arch/cris/entryoffsets.c

 * Copyright (C) 2001 Axis Communications AB

 * Generate structure offsets for use in entry.S.  No extra processing
 * needed more than compiling this file to assembly code.  Horrendous
 * assembly code will be generated, so don't look at that.
