I plan to commit the largest chunk of memory in the quickest way. This
operation may be slowed down by swapping - that's why I don't want to
get there. If swapping is not the right metric, what is then? 
According to my humble experiments with 2.4 and 2.6 kernels, some cashed
memory reported in /proc/meminfo is reused and some is swapped. The real
problem here is that I couldn't find the right way to "predict" how much
cached memory will be discarded before starting to swap when system is
low on available RAM.
Thanks
