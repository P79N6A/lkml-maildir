OK, so as strange as it sounds, that's really the string as stored in
the DMI table. How odd... You have to understand that I'm a bit
reluctant to adding it officially to the hdaps driver, given that it
clearly looks like a bogus table in your laptop. I guess that you only
have one laptop with this string?
Can you please check for a BIOS update for your laptop? Maybe that will
fix the string.
Thanks,
