Hi,
I am working on a larger kernel module.
This module will be based on a lot of
portable code, for which I have to implement
the OS depended code.
At the moment I can compile the complete
code into a module. Some of OS depended
code is still missing, but I do not get
any warnings from kbuild.
When I try to load the module, I can a really
strange error message:
 insmod: error inserting 'foo.o': -795847932 Function not implemented
What does that mean? How can I get a list
of missing symbols?
cu, Marco
