Carefull.... The ATA host controller patches showed that mindless fixing
would just hide the fact that, well let me  guess, 50% of cli() sti()
are remnants from the days we didn't even have spin locks or
are simple used becouse somone feeled like he needs "kind of safety"
and wanted to make some thing "bullet proof".. And it's easier to see 
this kind of aplication on cli() then on "carefully" added spinlocking. 
Becouse in the case of spinlocks there is always a chance that they 
interact with some code you don't see when looking at a particular place 
of usage of course...
