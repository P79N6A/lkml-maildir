I've made a small update to the "Mako" driver (my attempt to port the Wave
Artist driver to the PC so it may be used with the Shark Multimedia Mako
III sound card, or possibly others using the Rockwell RWA010, if there are
any). It's available at 
http://jpj.net/~trevor/linux/mako-2-2.3.3.diff.bz2
.
This version doesn't introduce hardware.h, and it's marked as experimental
when one configures it.
