Which is not really a good reason for why the SiS DRM module is still 
missing in 2.6...
The SiS _DRI_ driver has not been ported to Mesa 4 and later (which is 
why it is disabled in XFree 4.3), but for users of XFree 4.2 and 
earlier, the _DRM_ module could be of good use. (And at least on Debian, 
one could install the xlibsmesa3 packages over a 4.3 installation to get 
DRI working as before.)
