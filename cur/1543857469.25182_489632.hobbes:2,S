I could understand that, even if some people did agree with my desire
to increase legibility by decreasing visual clutter.  I think it also 
provides
some protection against typos in argument lists.
I'm (naively) curious as to why it's being flagged now as opposed to
two years ago when I submitted the original additions.
Have reviewers or review methods changed?
Have standards changed?
Did it just slip under someone's radar two years ago?
