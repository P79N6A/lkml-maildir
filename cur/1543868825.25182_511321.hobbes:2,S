Thanks.
Don't be worried.  They are both warning about perfectly acceptable
(though uncommon) behaviour.  These warnings have since been removed.
A process was interrupted while trying to get a lock, so the NFS
client didn't know if it actually had the lock or not.
When the process exited, the tried to cancel the lock just to be on
the safe side and was told that it didn't own any such lock.
