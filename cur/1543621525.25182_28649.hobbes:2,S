Global dependencies...  CML1 doesn't have this now, and it needs never
to have it.  This is no point in merging a design change of that
magnitude only to take it away later on.  Further, merging a rulebase
which contains such dependencies would be a huge mistake that might take
years to undo.  drivers/net/rules.cml doesn't need S/390 stuff in it,
AFAICT, and that is a simple example of a bug found in many of the
rules.cml files.
