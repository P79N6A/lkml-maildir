Hi,
I'm trying to copy over some 700Mb of data from one hfs-disk-image to
another. Both are mounted through the "loop" device. (Using -o loop on
the mount command)
By now I've seen several lockups due to trying to copy that data. 
Using "tar" or "cp -r" causes the lockup, using "rsync" takes much
longer to trigger it.
I'm running:
Linux version 2.2.15pre3 (wolff@cave) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66
  19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)) #3 Fri Feb 4 15:59:32 MET 2000
When the lockup occurs, one of the processes ends up in "disk wait" 
and stays that way. The first "sync" issued also hangs. Subsequent
"sync" commands return after a few seconds. 
I switched to using "rsync" to be able to restart after a crash, but I
seem to be able to copy most of the data without crashing. (But I now
have one hang using rsync). 
root       727  6.6  4.0  2404  1240  ?  D    13:19   0:58 rsync -avvcT /tmp ...
root       728  1.2  0.0     0     0  ?  Z    13:21   0:08 (rsync <zombie>)
				Roger.
P.S. I'm not in a hurry to have this fixed. I'll manage with the
current state of affairs. Just an item for someone's TODO list. ;-)
