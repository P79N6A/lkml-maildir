git-lost-found turns up some of the missing stuff that was applied
earliest in the rebase but the other stuff is apparently neither visible
anywhere in the tree or missing (the tree I was rebasing "^^^..." never
shows it nor does the log). The changes are in the objects if you dump
every object and investigate them by hand.
Beats me but a mix of a restore and reapplying some stuff from archived
email along with rescued objects seems to have recovered all lost
changesets.
