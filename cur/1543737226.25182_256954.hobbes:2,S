I've come late to this discussion. Not sure what the scope of this
cleanup is, but I'd like to see the flip buffers done away with
entirely, to be replaced by a single buffer with proper r/w locking.
Or keep the flip arrangement, but move it out of tty_struct so that it
can be made larger. Some of our high speed products find the rx buffer
to be less than sufficient.
