Subject: Supermount added to performance patches (-ck) for stable kernel

As my merged performance patches [O(1)+batch,Preempt,Low latency,-AA vm] are
aimed at the desktop user I've found many people have requested supermount as an
option. I have now added supermount support. Otherwise, ck7 is unchanged from
ck6, so unless you want supermount there is no point upgrading.
Get it here as 2.4.19-ck7:
