After several trials, with CONFIG_PROFILING=y and profile=1 nmi_watchdog=2
as boot parameters, I'm almost convinced I'm doing something wrong :)
- `readprofile` always just outputs one line:
     0 total                                    0.0000
- `readprofile -a` gives the whole kernel symbol list, all with zero times.
Is there anything else I can check around here?
