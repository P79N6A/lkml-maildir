Thats pure noise
On a 256Mb machine you have 65536 page map entries. Those are 64 bytes but
its not hard to get it down to 56 bytes (.5Mb saved) and probably to 48
bytes. We can probably also shave 8 bytes off each cached inode if not
more (the nfs changes in -ac are a big help there already) - thats typically
another 200K on a reasonable size box - and the new bootmem code can save a
chunk too
Im not sure how much the code change for function call patterns would be
but I doubt its so big for such little effort
