Ok, I see. Have you seen the timer actually coming in late, resulting
in hrtimer_forward returning non-zero? I guess it's not a big problem
for statistic data collection if that happens, but you might still want
to be able to see it.

You should not rely on user space tools to do the right thing in the kernel.
Moreover, if the exact frequency is not that important, as you mentioned
above, you can probably just hardcode a compile-time constant here.

My point was that it's not an array of lists, but an array of pointers
to lists. The way that include/list.h works is by having a struct list_head
as the anchor and then add nodes to it. By simply pointing to a list_head,
you won't be able to use the list_for_each_entry() macro the way it is meant.

That's not what I meant. If you have an embedded spu ELF file in a shared
library object, you end up recording the file of the main PPE binary, and
the offset of the SPU ELF inside of the .so file, but not the name of the
.so file itself.
You also say that the you record the name of the application on purpose for
separate SPU ELF files. My assumption was that this is not necessary, but
I don't know much about that aspect of oprofile. My feeling is that the
samples for an external SPU ELF file should be handled the same way that
oprofile handles events in shared libraries on the PPU (e.g. in libc.so).
