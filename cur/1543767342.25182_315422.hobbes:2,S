I'm also seeing a (small) problem with ACPI for a few -mm kernels
(at least since -rc2-mm2, IIRC).
I don't have a /proc/acpi/button/ anymore.
My computer is a Compaq Evo N600c laptop.
ACPI is generally working great here.
In 2.6.12-rc3, I have:
/proc/acpi/button/lid/C1A4/info
/proc/acpi/button/lid/C1A4/state
/proc/acpi/button/power/PWRF/info
/proc/acpi/button/sleep/C1A3/info
Nothing in rc3-mm1 (even no /proc/acpi/button/ directory).
I didn't find any interesting difference between dmesg from rc3 and
rc3-mm1. Both show these lines:
ACPI: Power Button (FF) [PWRF]
ACPI: Sleep Button (CM) [C1A3]
ACPI: Lid Switch [C1A4]
Any idea ?
Thanks
Brice
