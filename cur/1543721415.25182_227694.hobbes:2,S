Hi Community!
Could anybody please answer the question about kernel semaphore up() 
routine. I use kernel 2.6.6 on i386 but the question is about arch 
independent part.
Arch dependent up() implementation leads to try_to_wake_up () which 
calls resched_task() if the task been woken up  preempts the current task.
The question is - when the context switch  actually occures?
(resched_task only sets the bit but doesn't switch anything)
Thanks,
		Eugeny
