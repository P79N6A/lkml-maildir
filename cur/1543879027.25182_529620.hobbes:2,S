Subject: evdev* devices change major/minors after suspend/resume (udev?)

Dear all,
I wonder how one (from the userspace side) should deal with the case
that evdev devices disappear after resume and reappear under a different
name/different major/minor (i.e. evdev1 can become evdev4).
The application in mind scans all evdev devices, opens the ones matching
certain properties and then processes events on them.
Now the problem is that after resume devices disappear, so the
application rescans+reopens the evdev's BUT some of the evdevs are just
not available right after resume but appear at some point later in time.
Is there a way to wait till all evdev's are recreated / ask for udev to
settle ? Or what is the proposed way of dealing with that ?
Very concrete it is this evdev that may be missing... and just FYI this
also seems to cause trouble in Xorg - sometimes the appletouch mouse is
not yet back...
/dev/input/by-id/usb-Apple_Computer_Apple_Internal_Keyboard_._Trackpad-event-kbd -> ../event5
Any hints welcome,
Soeren
