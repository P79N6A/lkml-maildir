Hmm bad. Is it that hard to fix ?

Can't you just take out the timings in that case? 
My (not very informed) understanding is: 
everything should work with the BIOS timings and generic IDE,
having own timings is just an optimization to squeeze out a bit
more speed.

Hardly a release show stopper I guess
(ISA support in general being rather broken, but I doubt many people care
still)

I guess the kobject/sysfs stuff could be ripped out if it doesn't
work - it is probably not a "must have" feature.

Can't you just disable module unloading for the release ?
(not nice, but has worked for other subsystems like IPv6 too in the past)
Also 2.4 didn't have much problems without modular IDE, 2.6 will
be probably able to tolerate it too.

Then 2.0/2.2/2.4 would have been racy too :-) Apparently they worked though.
High level tty code doesn't touch any ttys as far as I can see.
It is done in n_tty.c, which apparently needs a bit of work
(found some races together with Rik there)

I was thinking about races with tty_release (= own tty_struct suddenly
going away). VFS would prevent that.
