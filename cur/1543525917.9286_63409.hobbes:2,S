I am using 2.3.46-1 and the have the RTL8139 network card.  The recent
changes to the driver cause the compilation to error.  I am using gcc
2.7.2.3.  The problem is the global param[][] that is
located in both rtl8129.c and 8139too.c.  These two conflict with one
another.  I don't have the source in front of me (it is at home) so I cannot
quote exact lines.  This problem occurred with the drives compiled into the
kernel.
My fix was to just make these static within each file.  This allows the
compile to complete successfully and the driver also worked.  I did not even
look to see if this constant data is the same between the two files.  I am
not sure who owns this issue or who to report it to.
Thanks
