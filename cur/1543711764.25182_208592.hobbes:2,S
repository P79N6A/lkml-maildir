Hi.
Thanks for the report; The end of your log shows us that it was
saslauthd that was causing the freezing failure. I'll look at what
adjustments would fix that issue.
Regarding getting more debugging info, you need to use debug_sections as
well as the default_console_level; the console level says how much
information you want. debug_sections says what information you want.
(Suspend it capable of printing an awful lot of debugging info; usually
we're only interested in one particular area).
Regards,
Nigel
