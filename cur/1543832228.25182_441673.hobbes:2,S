No, we shouldn't expand the use of system_state.  Code continues to be
merged which uses it.  If we also merge code which enhances its semantics
then we're getting into quadratically-increasing nastiness rather than
linearly-increasing.
Callers should tell callees what to do.  Callees shouldn't be peeking at
globals to work out what to do.
Lacking any other caller-passed indication, it would be much better for
acpi to look at irqs_disabled().  That's effectively a task-local,
cpu-local argument which was passed down to callees.  It's hacky - it's
like the PF_foo flags.  But it's heaps better than having all the kernel
fight over the state of a global.
