I believe that, being the director of a company that will be subject to
potential lawsuits in countries that signed up to the copyright treaty,
I'll stop buying parts from countries that will not guarantee my company
about copyright infringement. Looking their economy to lose huge parts of
its business, maybe it'll suggest those countries to join the copyright
treaty. Yes those parts might be dirt cheap, but if I have to spend big
bucks for lawsuits and if I have to see my company image to lose
sharpness, I'd better go picking up parts where at least I can sue back my
suppliers in case they'll break copyright in what they did license to me.
