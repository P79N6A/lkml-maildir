I think there is a misunderstanding here.
FUTEX_WAKE_OP is implemented to handle simultaneously more than one 
futex in some specific situations (such as pthread_cond_signal).
The scenario I've described occurred in futex_wake, futex_wake_op and 
futex_requeue and is _independent_ of the userlevel code.
All these functions call wake_futex, and then wake_up_all, with the 
futex_hash_bucket lock still held.
If the woken thread is immediately scheduled (in wake_up_all), and only 
in this case (because of a higher priority, etc), it will try to take 
this lock too (because of the "if (lock_ptr != 0)" statement in 
unqueue_me), causing two task-switches to take this lock for nothing.
Otherwise, it will not: lock_ptr is set to NULL just after the 
wake_up_all call)
This scenario happens at least in pthread_cond_signal, 
pthread_cond_broadcast and probably all pthread_*_unlock functions.
The patch I've proposed should, at least in theory, solve this. But I'm 
not sure of the correctness...
