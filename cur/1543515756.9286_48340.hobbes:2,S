Not yet, I'm still working on this.

Since the smp support it's not simple anymore anyway. The current ide
problems show that.

I don't want that drivers know about interrupt levels, I want it even
simpler, they should basically assume nothing about specific interrupt
behavivour and interrupt tuning shouldn't happen within the driver,
except of hints to the interrupt system.
