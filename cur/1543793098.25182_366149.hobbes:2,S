I didn't see Andi's comment to that effect.  I may have originally 
argued that when I made CR4 reads depend on CPU family.  But I think it 
is useful to know if PSE is enabled, especially on 486s that do support it.
Agree nested exceptions are evil.  But where is this called from 
execption context? 
1) softlockup_tick appears to be perfectly safe call site to handle 
exceptions
2) sysrq-p is also a fine site.
I tested this by assembling a hacked safe_read_cr1() macro, and dumped 
the contents of my non-existant CR1 regsiter in show_regs to prove the 
fault handling correct (although the code already _looks_ correct, I 
thought someone might ask the question you just did. :)
