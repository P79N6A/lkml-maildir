Hmm, I never experienced this problem, but when I copy lerga files from 
a slow fast media to a slower one (HD --> MO), the system becoms very 
slow to load programs. I suppose the cause is that all available memory 
gets filled with buffers and there is no space left to load something. 
This, combined with the bug|feature that causes memory being swapped 
even if there still is free memory, results in temporary freeze of some 
processes. Anyway, CPU usage remains normal.
