Did you even bother to read my first mail?  Quoting myself:
    "The patch does also trigger an EPERM when someone tries
    to chown/chgrp an entry (which is currently silently ignored)."
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
and
    "... it is currently possible for the owner of a process to
    temporarily chmod the entries."
Those are the problems that my patch fixes!  And NO, chmod is NOT
persistent.  It just appears to be.  The permissions are dropped
when the dentry for a file is released (and with it, the reference
to the temporary inode).  (You might have understood this.
I don't know what you mean by "for the moment".)
It's a very Bad Thing that the chmod succeeds for a while, because
it gives users the impression that the files can be protected
(e.g. /proc/<pid>/cmdline).  As it is now, you'll have to look
at the kernel source to figure out which files will preserve
their permissions...

Not any file exists under /proc, so I'll rather take a file that
is there for my examples.
