I really don't see how this is going to make it easier to debug
anything.  Remember, when a kref goes to 0, it is automatically freed.
So any code that tries to use it afterward just dies a horrible death,
if CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB is enabled.
And please be careful, you can't replace all usages of atomic_t counters
in the kernel with krefs...
