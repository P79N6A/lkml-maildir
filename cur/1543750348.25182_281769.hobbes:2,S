Hiya... Known feature :-( See
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=118165
 for details.
"See last paragraph of comment #66. The problem is that the driver
needs about 750k of memory that has to be located under 1GB physically
to not trigger the hardware bug that causes crashes and other fun. The
driver tries to allocate that kind of memory
(pci_set_consistent_dma_mask(pdev, 0x3fffffff) ). There should be
plenty, right?
Unfortunately the way it's implemented right now in the generic x86
pci code is that if you ask for some memory with a dma mask of < 4GB,
it falls back to giving you memory from the first 16MB. Now that's a
pretty limited resource :-(. There seems to be 3 drivers that need
similar workarounds (wanxl, aacraid and b44)"
Quickest "fix" is to use a B44_DMA_MASK of 0xffffffff . Which is the
pre-2.6.9 behaviour and is fine if you have <= 1GB of memory or use the
standard 1:3 kernel:user split.
