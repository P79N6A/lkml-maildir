Well, even without FLUSH CACHE, you can expect that sector being
writen during powerfail either contains old data *or* new data.
If sector can become unreadable after powerfail, I guess journaling
people would like to know, and if powerfail may mean adjacent (or even
unrelated?) sectors to be damaged, everyone needs to know...
