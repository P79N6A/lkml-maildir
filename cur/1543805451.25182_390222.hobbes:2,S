I screwed up the From line, so Al got it and Jakub didn't. Fixed.

It's everything that transitively calls glibc's vfprintf() call, which
is almost the whole printf() family. That is to say, vfprintf(),
printf(), vprintf(), vfwprintf()... and more, but the inclusion
of printf() is enough.

It's only called for i18ned stuff using the positional parameter
specifiers, like %.2$s... it's to stop people passing something like
%.500000$s; glibc, of course, can't tell where the parameter list ends
without GCC support, and even *with* that support it can't tell for
every case (e.g. for direct calls to vfprintf()); so the heuristic
that's used is that valid values of those parameters must necessarily
fall into space which is not writable (as you can't write to a code
segment that you're currently executing). This stops format string
attacks from being *too* devastating, one hopes; attackers can't spy on
the program's data that way.
It does handle failure cases, viz
  if (fp == NULL)
    {
      /* It is the system administrator's choice to not have /proc
         available to this process (e.g., because it runs in a chroot
         environment.  Don't fail in this case.  */
      if (errno == ENOENT
          /* The kernel has a bug in that a process is denied access
             to the /proc filesystem if it is set[ug]id.  There has
             been no willingness to change this in the kernel so
             far.  */
          || errno == EACCES)
        return 1;
      return -1;
    }
but of course it would be better if that latter failure case wasn't
needed in future.
