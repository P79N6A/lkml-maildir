Subject: Promise ATA/133 TX2 IDE Card - Linux 2.4.x driver problem.

It may be too early to speculate, however, I have received no spurious
kernel messages with the first generation Promise ATA/100 board (so far).
I have another motherboard (MSI), with another Promise ATA/133 board
(TX2), which also gives this spurious interrupts.
root@l1:/var/log# grep -i spurious *
syslog.1:Jun 19 10:08:48 l1 kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
syslog.2:Jun 12 09:33:07 l1 kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
syslog.2:Jun 12 20:03:55 l1 kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
syslog.2:Jun 14 06:42:23 l1 kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
syslog.2:Jun 14 16:12:37 l1 kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
syslog.3:Jun  3 09:27:44 l1 kernel: spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
Is there a particular problem with the ATA/133 TX2 boards, this
error/problem seems to appear with box (that I've used) with this board
(ATA/133 TX2).
Also, I've used the ATA/100 in another box for about a 2 year period
without a single spurious interrupt message.
This leads me to believe there may be something wrong with the Promise
ATA/133 TX2 driver for Linux?
