I've managed to have cat /proc/cpuinfo
read correctly. somewhere somehow
when compiling xserver I Installed
some package that messed up libpowersaved11
and liblazy1. reinstalling those packages as well
as the other powersaved packages seems to have resolved this
issue for me.(as well as haveing  cpufreq running correctly);
I just can't remember what might the package be that
caused this to go crazy.(oh-well);
as long as the fans aren't screaming/or stuck I'm happy...
