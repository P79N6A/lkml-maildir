Then shouldn't you also avoid unprepping and reprepping a command that is
deferred because the host isn't ready?
And isn't it necessary to make sure that req->special is NULL when
submitting a special request with no scsi_request, and that
cmd->sc_request is NULL when associating a command block to a special
request with no scsi_request?
In short, is this patch needed?
