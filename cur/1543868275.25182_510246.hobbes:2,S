Well, I didn't know about it either before I was told about how hwinfo
was able to retrieve the information.

OK, it makes sense, thanks for clarifying this point.
Would it be acceptable to add some code in the kernel to read the
settings from the BIOS where possible, and have the kernel write these
settings rather than the default "all LEDs disabled"?
The problem is that I don't know how we can know for sure whether there
is BIOS RAM to read from, or not. Now that some x86-based system use
EFI instead of a traditional BIOS, I guess we can't just assume that
x86 or x86-64 implies there's a BIOS.
