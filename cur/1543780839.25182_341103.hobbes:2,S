Hi Bart !
That seem to be a new problem though I can't tell for sure when it
started. I've had reports from users for some time now of
"occasional" (once in a while, maybe once a day) lost interrupts on the
mac hard disk. I have about 30 days uptime and just saw a similar one in
my log. It happen during a disk access storm (apt-get upgrade :).
The problem when this happen is that I just lost DMA which is fairly
annoying. Users are not supposed to understand the magic of hdparm
-d1 /dev/hda and that shouldn't happen anyways...
Do you have any clue of what can be going on ? The IDE pmac driver has
not changed for a long time and I think that problem is fairly new
(maybe 2.6.12 ? not sure, first time I actually see it unless it's
unrelated and my disk is actually dying).
Shouldn't we have some more retry before giving up on DMA ?
Regards,
Ben.
