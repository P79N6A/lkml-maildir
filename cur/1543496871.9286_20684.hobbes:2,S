Such "cleaning" is the bane of LFSes.  Or one of them, at least: read
performance fragmentation is another.
Have a browse around 
http://www.netapps.com/technology/
 for a _really_
good alternative.  Netapp's write-anywhere filesystem allows the same
write streaming performance that LFS gives, without restricting the
allocater in the way that LFS does.
