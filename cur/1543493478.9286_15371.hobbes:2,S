Thank you for your comments. We are looking forward to your full patch.
Let me explain again. All interrupts are delivered to the first CPU only.
Our machine has two IO APICs. Current 2.2.6 SMP kernel does not support
multiple IO APICs yet, so our machine is running with non SMP mode. In 
this case that second CPU did not receive interrupts and the secound CPU
will never be rescheduled. We accordingly sent this bug report.
By the way, we will finish soon to create the patch for kernel 2.2.6
which support multiple IO APICs. Now we are testing it on our system. We
will contribute patch to this mailing list, after our testing is completed.
