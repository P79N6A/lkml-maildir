Let's put it this way: for me, 2005-10-10 doesn't work and anything earlier doesn't build.  I've tried building against 2.6.15-rc3, 2.6.14 and 2.6.13.  The card doesn't
work against the built-in 2.6.13 code, but the tuner is sending bizarre stuff
to it (channel 2 is *not* at 97.25 MHz).  2.6.14 kept spewing:
CORE IOCTL: 0xc054561d
cx88[0]: ioctl 0xc054561d (v4l2, rw, VIDIOC_G_TUNER)
all over the syslog.
Build issues include broken Makefiles (around 10-08) and missing header files.
