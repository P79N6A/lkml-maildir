Wait a minute...
Do I understand you and your patch right?
Dell sells a machine with a Pentium III Mobile CPU with Speedstep
technology, and now you tell us that it won't work?  Ever?
Does this mean that a lot of people (including me) bought a very
advanced and expensive piece of trash?  Then it's about time that
I contact Dell, because they screwed me.
Does Speedstep work on this machine with Windows/XP?
(I never checked, removed it first thing after unpacking the machine.)
Regards,
Toon.
