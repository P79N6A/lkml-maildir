Ingo, did you take a look at my alternative?  It postpones the unmasking
of the interrupt till the enable_irq is done.  It also doesn't have the
need to update 300+ calls to disable/enable_irq.
Also, the disable_irq_handler doesn't solve the case if the misrouted
irq came from the device that its driver called the disable_irq_handler.
This doesn't affect irqpoll, but for those cases that have broken irq
setups needing irqfixup this can still allow an irq storm.
