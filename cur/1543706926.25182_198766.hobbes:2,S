Unfortunately not much, I was hot, tired, not at my best - should have
grabbed it when I had the chance. All I grabbed was a partial code string
at the bottom of the  Oops which I doubt is of any benefit without the rest.

Oh yeah, it killed init too. 
System defaults to not logging to permanent storage, flash would die over
time from writes and info would be meaningless to customer on their removable
hard drive. Note to self - must change that - I'm sure customer could spare some
space. 
I assumed I could reproduce the fault today if but it wouldn't fault.
First misbehaved Friday 13th, reproduced Sat 14th.
Self cured??? Sunday 15th. Doh!!!

I note memfree stabilises at around 4Mb when running OK, given it only wanted
an extra 1Mb cache swap, can I cat something to /proc/sys/vm/????? to force
it to stabilise at around 10Mb or 20Mb? Otherwise can I change a constant
and recompile kernel to achieve same? It might help give more headroom when
the event occurs.

I admit it, I since tried the 'add more RAM' but a couple of capture card devices
did not like more than about 800Mb so I pulled the stick back out. It ran quite
well in 256Mb with the old kernel for about a year so it is puzzling.
