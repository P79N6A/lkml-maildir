This is from a work queue, so in fact from a process context, but from
a process that is running with PF_NOFREEZE.
And I don't think we can forbid filesystems to use work queues.  IMO it's
a legitimate thing to do for an fs.
_But_.
Alasdair, do I think correctly that if there's a suspended device-mapper
device below an non-frozen filesystem, then sys_sync() would block just
as well as freeze_bdev() on this filesystem?
