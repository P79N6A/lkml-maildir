Oh.  Please pardon my ignorance, as this is my first oops report. 
Well, I have run insmod_ksymoops_clean and this is what I get now:
ksymoops 0.7c on i686 2.2.13.  Options used
     -V (default)
     -k /var/log/ksymoops/19991122104940.ksyms (specified)
     -l /var/log/ksymoops/19991122104940.modules (specified)
     -o /lib/modules/2.2.13/ (default)
     -m /boot/System.map-2.2.13 (specified)

Note that I did not specify -v.  This is because I only have vmlinuz,
not vmlinux.  Apparently Debian's make-kpkg cleans up vmlinux after
itself, and it does not include it in the kernel-image_*.deb package
that it creates, either. :(  Is this why the call trace and code lines
are missing?
