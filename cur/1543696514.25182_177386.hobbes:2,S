Subject: loop device lockup bugs in 2.4.18? (hangs with multiCD --noburn=1)

Are there any known or suspected bugs with loop devices in 2.4.18?
Running multiCD with CD-burning disabled ("multiCD --noburn=1"),
my system frequently hangs (e.g., Caps Lock key doesn't even toggle
the Caps Lock LED).
The main thing that multiCD does (when not actually burning CDs)
seems to be manipulating CD-size ext2 filesystem files via loopback.
Thanks,
Daniel
