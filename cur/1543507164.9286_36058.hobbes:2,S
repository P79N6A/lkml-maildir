I assume that your onboard chipset is disabled then?
Does it come up as hda or hde?
If it was that simple, it would have made the statement.
Enable the onboard controllers and attach any device and see the fun.
It is harmless, since it can not find the root partition the drive is not
accessed.  Do expect a kernel barf.

It is "idex=ata66" for possible generic support of known chipsets.
