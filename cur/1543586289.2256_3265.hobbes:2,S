Hi,
I solved it for now using the SmartStart-CD as described and I'll flash the,
ROM as soon as possible - thanks for all answers.
The only thing that isn't working yet is the FibreChannel controller.
Has anybody dealed with this internal controller and an external
COMPAQ Raid Array 4100, connected via an external FC-AL Switch?  
Thx,
Frank
