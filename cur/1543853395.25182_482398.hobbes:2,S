Yes, if i make radeon_pci_resume a nop, the machine resumes if i do a return 0 
immediately.
I think I tracked it down to the call to acquire_console_sem() as the 
following code makes the machine hang again:
int radeonfb_pci_resume(struct pci_dev *pdev)
{
        struct fb_info *info = pci_get_drvdata(pdev);
        struct radeonfb_info *rinfo = info->par;
        int rc = 0;
        if (pdev->dev.power.power_state.event == PM_EVENT_ON)
                return 0;
        if (rinfo->no_schedule) {
        /*      if (try_acquire_console_sem())*/
                        return 0;
        } else
                acquire_console_sem();
        return 0;
...
