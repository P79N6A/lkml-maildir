I read you found the real cause so that may be bogus, but I have got two
messages while booting. The first showed up while doing the fsck of a 6
GB file systems and killed the process (fscks of smaller partitions
completed successfully), the second occured while initializing
/dev/random and left an unkillable dd process and a stuck boot process
(I gathered this info with sysrq).
Being -test12 unstable for me, if you don't need more data I'll go back
to -test9 until the next release.
