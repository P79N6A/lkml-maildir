hmm, there is a joke in Austria, where some
obviously polyglot person asks two natives in
several languages for directions ... and gets
no answer at all, when he has left, one of
the natives says to the other: "have you
heard how many languages he spoke?", and the
other replies: "yeah sure, but did it do him
any good?"
so not everybody capable of speaking english
will do so ...
best,
Herbert
