On x86, yes. Practically any instruction will clobber cc anyway, so it's 
the default.
Although the gcc guys have occasionally been suggesting we should set it 
in our asms.

We should just do this natively. There's been several tests over the years 
saying that it's much more efficient to do sti/cli as a simple store, and 
handling the "oops, we got an interrupt while interrupts were disabled" as 
a special case.
I have this dim memory that ARM has done it that way for a long time 
because it's so expensive to do a "real" cli/sti.
And I think -rt does it for other reasons. It's just more flexible.
