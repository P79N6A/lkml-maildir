The rt-overload mechanism is distinct from load balancing.  RT overload 
attempts to make sure the NR_CPUS highest priority runnable tasks are running 
on each of the available CPUs.  This isn't load balancing, this is "system 
wide strict realtime priority scheduling" (SWSRPS).  This scheduling should 
take place even if there are 1000 non RT tasks on CPU 0 and none on all the 
others.  The load balancer would be responsible for distributing those 1000 
non rt tasks to all the CPUs.

I don't feel that SWSRPS in anyway interferes with realtime applications.  If 
an application does not explicitly set a cpu affinity, then the kernel should 
assume the task can run on any CPU and should make SWSRPS decisions 
accordingly.  In fact, in my experience, applications expect this type of 
scheduling - and don't consider it an interference.

Actually the SWSRPS is what makes the scheduling deterministic.  That 
determinism comes at a cost, but without it it doesn't exist at all on an SMP 
machine.  So saying it "adds to the maximum deterministic response time" 
doesn't really make any sense.

It's my impression (RT folks please pipe up if it's wrong) that if you don't 
care about priority scheduling (i.e. it's OK for a lower priority task to run 
while one with a higher priority sits waiting on another queue), then you 
don't use SCHED_FIFO.  So I don't think case 2 is really valid.

You've made a lot of references to binding tasks to CPUs (or forbidding them, 
which is essentially a bind to non-forbidden CPUs).  While application 
developers can certainly take this approach, the linux kernel should schedule 
realtime tasks globally according to priority in the generic case.
