Here's FAQ node about bug:
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/faq.html#dir2
You can find fixes in .17 stable git tree.
If it was really just sparse annotations, they were obviously
fixed, i think. If not, meybe there are some new bugs.

As in faq:
,--
.....
|   Update: a fixed xfs_repair is now available; version 2.8.10 or later
|   of the xfsprogs package contains the fixed version.
.....      
|   The xfs_check tool, or xfs_repair -n, should be able to detect any
|   directory corruption.
