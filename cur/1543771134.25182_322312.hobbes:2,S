i'd have expected you to say "oops, i was wrong, thanks for the 
explanation", but now you come up with a completely nontechnical topic 
instead?

yes, and everything works just fine, if it's deadlock-free under normal 
SMP Linux. The key to that is that the whole execution flow is 'flat'.  
I.e. _all_ driver code (except a few notable exceptions that dont count) 
runs in a thread context. So spinlocks are _never_ recursively taken by 
the same thread under PREEMPT_RT - and the scheduler sorts out all the 
inter-thread blocking.
This is the basic concept of PREEMPT_RT. [ I have to say that I'm happy 
that while you have already written 12 emails into this thread with a 
seemingly firm and competent opinion - arguing against various aspects 
of PREEMPT_RT - today you finally seem to have gotten closer to 
understanding its basics ;-) ]
