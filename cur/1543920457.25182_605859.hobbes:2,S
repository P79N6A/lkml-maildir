The fact is that we were not used to anything using the keyboard controller
as a message-passing device, but nowadays that is (unfortunately) happening.
It still doesn't mean it belongs inside the stream of data for the keyboard,
maskerading as a key press.

I don't think it is excessive at all, actually.  But I am known to take the
longer and harder road if I think the end result will be neater and more
organized.

IMO we might as well go to the clean road, deploy a generic interface that
CAN do it properly (might as well be input, but Dmitry has some good reasons
not to want it there), and move to it.

Am I the only one seeing the irony on that comment over the idea of sending
such events through the input layer?  ACPI is not just a way to talk to AML
crap in the BIOS.  Is a (somewhat obtuse, very limited) generic interface to
model the hardware.  But for backlight, it certianly is powerful enough.
If you want an even more generic interface, I am fine with it too (just make
sure to move ACPI over to that interface as well).
