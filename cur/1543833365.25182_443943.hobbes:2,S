   Bottom half of your driver code is the were you can take advantage of
the SMP feature.You can use either workqueue(which is a simpler
interface which will create number threads based on the cpu count ),but
if U want finer control you can use Kthread(which does'nt inherits
parents sigmask and VM) or kernel_thread, depending on your need.

NO!
You should just use a normal KBuild makefile, and not ever add any extra
cflags....
(but you failed to provide a URL to even your Makefile but also to your
code so it's hard to give you a detailed recommendation)
