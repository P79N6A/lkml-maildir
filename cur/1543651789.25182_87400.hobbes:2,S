You know, I hope, that you can kmalloc(GFP_KERNEL) something in
init_module() and it will always be resident in the kernel until
you kfree() it in cleanup_module(). You do not have to
allocate/deallocate every time your module does something.
If you need a physical location, mmap() and ioremap() take care
of that. With these capabilities, I don't think you need "holes"
even if you are trying to map-out bad RAM. I think you need to
re-think your requirements.
