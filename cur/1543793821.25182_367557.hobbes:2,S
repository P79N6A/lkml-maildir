I like it but:
* "we know it's either an FS or PC request" assumption in
  ide_softirq_done() is really wrong
* same with "uptodate = rq->errors"
* blk_complete_request() is called with ide_lock hold but
  ide_softirq_done() also takes ide_lock - is this correct?
"There's still room for improvement, as __ide_end_request() really
could drop the lock after getting HWGROUP->rq (why does it need to
hold it in the first place? If ->rq access isn't serialized, we are
screwed anyways)."
ide_preempt?  and yes we are screwed...
