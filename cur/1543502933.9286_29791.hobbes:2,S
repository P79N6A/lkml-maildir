That's fine.  The one thing it will _not_ do is clear out cached pages
which are still referenced by the virtual memory system.  Flushing
memory by trying to allocate lots will try to swap that memory out too.
Remember, any running binaries or in-use libraries will have pages
mapped into some process's address space, so just going through the
cache won't get rid of those pages: you'll have to unmap them first by
passing through the swapper too.
