He was talking about locally generated packets. If the packets have 
different source addresses that is no problem of course. For forwarded
packets they probably have. For locally generally packets when the
application does not do an explicit bind(2) the kernel automagically choses 
an appropiate interface, which is usually the first that makes sense.
Thus if you want to always answer on the same interface you would need
multiple sockets, each bound to one interface using SO_BINDTODEVICE [if you
have multiple ones with the same IP] or bind(2) [if they have at least
different IPs]. Using IP_PKTINFO is a more lightweight alternative.
As for the difference between TCP and UDP: TCP is connection oriented 
and always uses the destination address of the first SYN packet as source
address. In case of having multiple interfaces with the same IP it uses
the first as usual (except when you have load balancing active of course)
