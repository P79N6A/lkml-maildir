Why not?  That is exactly what happens if you suspend and swap floppies. 
  Just don't do that and you're fine.  It is nice if you can handle the 
swapped case more gracefully, but not at the cost of data loss in the 
_normal_ case.

This is a very good argument for _correctly_ detecting device removal. 
I am not arguing against that.  The problem is with _incorrectly_ 
detecting device removal.

Some distros do.  Some do not.  I side with those who do not because 
doing so promotes stupid users ( they won't learn until it bites them 
twice ) and because it burns out the flash memory 10 times faster and 
slows down access.

There is currently no such method of reconnecting a filesystem to a 
device once the device has been broken by an eject, is there?  Also that 
amounts to much the same thing as I have been saying all along: the 
system should check to see if the device that is there now is the same 
as the one that was there before, and if so, resume using it.

That seems rather complex with little benefit.  The only advantage that 
would have over not breaking the mount in the first place is in the 
pedantic case where the user screws with the media during suspend. 
Seems like a high price to pay to cleanly deal with a pedantic error 
condition.
