No, that shouldn't happen.  The 'check' should notice any other disk
activity and slow down if anything else is happening on the device.
Did the check run to completion?  And if so, did the 'lftp' start
working normally again?
Did you look at "cat /proc/mdstat" ?? What sort of speed was the check
running at?
