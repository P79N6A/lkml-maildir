Another error message is the following one:
EXT3-fs error (device md0): ext3_readdir: bad entry in directory #12812298: directory entry across blocks - offset=0, inode=1308, rec_len=38720, name_len=225
Hmm.

I see the following messages with dmesg, but they appear to be
non-critical:
init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (67)
init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (177766)
init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (5)
init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (65)
init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (53664)
init_special_inode: bogus i_mode (5)
Are they related?  They didn't appear with ext3.
