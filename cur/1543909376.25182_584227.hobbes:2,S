handle_level_irq() does not set the PENDING bit on delayed disable.

No. Let me explain:
Before delayed disable:
	irq_disable(); /* Mask in hardware */
	....
	-> Interrupt line is asserted. No interrupt due to hardware mask
	....
	irq_enable();  /* Unmask */
	
	-> When interrupt line is still active, then the interrupt is
	   invoked. Otherwise nothing happens
Delayed disable (with level fix):
	irq_disable(); /* Do not mask in hardware */
	....
	-> Interrupt line is asserted.
	---> interrupt handler is invoked: interrupt is masked in
	     hardware
	....
	irq_enable();  /* Unmask */
	
	-> When interrupt line is still active, then the interrupt is
	   invoked. Otherwise nothing happens
Can we agree, that this is the same ?

Level type interrupts _are_ active as long as the hardware pin of the
interrupt line is driven by a device to the active level. 
When the hardware pin is kept at the active level by a device, the ACK
of the interrupt controller does not change the interrupt line of the
device. The interrupt comes back again immediately.
Edge type interrupts are different:
The interrupt is only triggered on the transition of the hardware pin
from inactive to active level. So the above scheme looks like:
Before delayed disable:
	irq_disable(); /* Mask in hardware */
	....
	-> Interrupt line is asserted. No interrupt due to hardware mask
	....
	irq_enable();  /* Unmask */
	
	-> The now unmasked interrupt becomes active and the interrupt
	   handler is invoked.
Delayed disable:
	irq_disable(); /* Do not mask in hardware */
	....
	-> Interrupt line is asserted.
	---> interrupt handler is invoked: interrupt is masked in
	     hardware, acknowledged and marked PENDING
	....
	irq_enable();  /* Unmask */
	
	-> On unmask the hardware does not invoke the interrupt, because
	   we acknowledged it above. Here we need to use the
	   hard-/soft-ware resend mechanism, otherwise the interrupt
	   would be lost

Well, there is nothing legacy. level type interrupts do not need the
resend mechanism at all. This misfeature was introduced with the delayed
disable and went unnoticed until now.
