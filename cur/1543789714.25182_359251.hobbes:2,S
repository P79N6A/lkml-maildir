Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Generic Timeofday Subsystem (v B8) (cumulative: i386, x86_86)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

All,
	Attached is the cumulative patch (for i386 and x86_64) for my generic
timekeeping rework (v. B8). Since this is mainly a fixup patch for
testers and for syncing with upstream users (ktimers/rt) I'm not
including the broken out patch set. I'll resume doing full patch set for
B9 (when I have a few more moments free). This patch provides the NTP
changes, the timesource abstraction, the core timekeeping code as well
as the code to convert the i386 and x86-64 archs.
Basically a few bug fixes and re-arranging code to aid upstream users of
my patch. Most of these changes were at the suggestion of Thomas
Gleixner. 
New in this release:
o Minor whitespace fixups
o Move generic code to kernel/time/*
o Move some of the clocksource drivers into the arch specific hardware
files
o Fixed time inconsistency bug when changing clocksources.
o i386 sched_clock optimizations
o fixed c3tsc drift problem
Still on the TODO list:
o Optimize out the clocksource_read switch statement & vsyscall rework
o Bigger cleanup arch specific bits
o Further reorganizing of the driver/clocksource/ files to be closer to
the hardware support code.
This patch should apply against Linus' git tree from today.
I'd like to thank the following people who have contributed ideas,
criticism, testing and code that has helped shape this work:
	George Anzinger, Nish Aravamudan, Max Asbock, Dominik Brodowski, Thomas
Gleixner, Darren Hart, Christoph Lameter, Matt Mackal, Keith Mannthey,
Ingo Molnar, Martin Schwidefsky, Frank Sorenson, Ulrich Windl, Darrick
Wong, Roman Zippel and any others whom I've accidentally forgotten.
Please let me know if you have any comments or feedback.
thanks
