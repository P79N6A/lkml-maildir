It would be nice to fix this in a single place, for all filesystems,
for all time.  But how to do that?

Perhaps nd_set_link() is a suitable place?  Change that function so
that it is passed a third argument (max_len) and then check that within
nd_set_link().  Change nd_set_link() to return a __must_check-marked
errno, change callers to handle errors appropriately.
Or something totally different ;)  But along those lines?
