To me, this looks like it would make more sense to set this to 1 _before_
the switch statement, and set to 0 as necessary, as most of the cases
look removable to me. Should cut out a few lines of code, and also mark
things like ide-tape as removable in the process too. Or is this not
desired behaviour for some reason ?
