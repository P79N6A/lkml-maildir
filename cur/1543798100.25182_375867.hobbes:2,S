Hi Ashutosh, Jasper,

More importantly:
	const char *name = NULL; /* GCC 4.0 warns */
(I assume that's why you have the useless initialization).

I would discard the unlikely() here; it's a completely wasted
micro-optimization in this context

I agree, KERN_ERR is appropriate here.

We already do this to resolve (more) symbols, so I don't see it as a
problem.  However, I believe that lock is redundant here: we need both
locks to write the list, but either is sufficient for reading, and we
already hold the sem.
Cheers,
