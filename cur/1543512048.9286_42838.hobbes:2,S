Now *STOP* being collectively stupid, and cross-posting all possible
lists what some moron has used in the beginning of this thread.
For that matter, discussion continuation about "Microsoft FUD" will
result immediate expellation of person posting an item...
(beginning friday evening)
If you have something to write about ON TOPIC issues on some of the
lists receiving this email, by all means post it, but lets declare
a week of 'NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY OFF-TOPIC ITEMS' on VGER's lists.
Thank you.
