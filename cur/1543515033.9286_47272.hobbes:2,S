Ah, thanks for the explanation.  In that case, why was this shifting
done elsewhere in patch-2.3.25?  Ie. in linux/drivers/char/mem.c,
linux/fs/ncpfs/mmap.c, and others?  linux/drivers/char/mem.c involves
an unsigned long, linux/fs/ncpfs/mmap.c involves an int.  Is this a
bug in those places, or is there some reason why this was not a
problem over there?
