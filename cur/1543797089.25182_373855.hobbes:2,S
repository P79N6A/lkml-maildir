Well if you look at the other uses vserver and bsd style jail
mechanisms the concept is not nearly so ridiculous.
The funny thing though is that this is a trivial thing to continue
to make be sensible.  Run the process in a chroot or a private

The way you describe it I bet that tmpfs will likely be a small
fraction of the size of the processes that you are thinking
about checkpointing.
