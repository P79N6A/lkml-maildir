I am willing to bet that perl can tree iterate with one line of code....
Please read the Hideous Name by Rob Pike.  You are making it more hideous.

Try v4.

Well, if you had an obsessive desire to not use V4, you could fix this
in V3 instead.

Might be easier to use V4...  so many bugs got added to an otherwise
stable V3.....

Hmm, maybe it was all perfectly predictable to an architect....

What quality architect does not?  Users are to be listened to with great
care.  Users are to be listened to with great discretion.

It is more stable than V3 was when it went in, and surely it is more
stable than ext4....
It is getting there.  Recent get ready for mainline changes added bugs. 
We need to get some patches out the door tomorrow, and then we should be
back to being stable again.

not my doing;-)  we wasted a lot of time shuffling code from one side of
the room to the other for no measurable benefit.  If only that time
could have been spent on the things I know deserve work.

so why did you take their stable branch away from them by working on
more than bugfixes for V3?
Jeff, working on v3 at this point is nuts.  V4 blows it away....
