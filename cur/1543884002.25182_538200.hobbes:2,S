The intent of the vague wording was to have the copyright notice and 
Compaq disclaimer of warranties preserved in the source code, not in 
binaries, but it is definitely ambiguous. As I understand it, copyright 
law says the copyright notices need to be preserved in source code, so 
that part of the statement is redundant, and GPL has its own warrantee 
disclaimer, so I think the standard wording is just fine. I approve 
changing to the more standard GPL wording used in the kernel sources in 
order to make this acceptable into the kernel.org tree.
