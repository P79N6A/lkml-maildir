I guess this is okay for now, but we probably want to make it more
elaborate in future.
Console switch is there to make sure kernel (not X) owns the graphical
hardware.
That is unneccessary for gxfb since X never owns graphics hardware,
good. (I do not see why it is optional, then. Do you really want to
see tty1?)
Now, question is what happens with two graphics cards, one of them
driven by X. Fortunately that is uncommon.
Also, it would be nice to make the logic the other way around. Move vt
switching to the drivers that need it because X can be expected to own
the hardware.
