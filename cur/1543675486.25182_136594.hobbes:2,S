One problem is found: I enabled ACPI and disabled APM.
On poweroff, I got an oops after every service stopped.
I was able to read some lines vaguely, it wrote something about
"acpi_poweroff called", "IRQ#20 disabled", but I was not able to
write the oops down because the machine switched itself off.
Here are some info I was able to gather:
