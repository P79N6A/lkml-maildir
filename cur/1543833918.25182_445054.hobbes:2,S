Hans,
I appreciate your vision and willingness to work to that vision.
The above though, is pure and simple PR. Please do not confuse PR with 
maintenance, or design maintenance.
I run pretty recent kernels on some of my servers and or workstations 
(2.6.17.4 at the moment). Some others are still using 2.4. All of them 
are using reiserfs3. I use reiser3 for most all, except video 
application partitions where XFS is used. For the past 2 yr i have been 
really pressed for time, and as a result have needed to scale back on 
pet projects, like testing new filesystems which are not yet into 
mainline. Once Reiserfs4 gets into mainline, i will test on a 
workstation. Till that time (and after) any work done on reiserfs3 is 
very much appreciated by me. It is keeping v3 up with changing 
requirements and expectations.
You cannot start developing a new version and then quit supporting the 
previous version. I consider the work Jeff and others have been doing a 
very good maintenance job. YES, a maintenance job. Addition of 
relatively minor features is part of normal maintenance.
I expect you to disagree here, i am used to that (having followed 
reiserfs list for many years).
Cheers,
Rudy Zijlstra
P.S. reducing maintenance to pure bug-fixing is tentamount to announcing 
EOL.
