Gidday,
I just released man-pages-2.43.
This release is now available for download at:
    
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
    or mirrors: 
ftp://ftp.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/docs/manpages
and soon at:
    
ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/manpages
Changes in this release that may be of interest to readers
of this list include the following:
Changes to individual pages
---------------------------
rtc.4
    David Brownell
        Update the RTC man page to reflect the new RTC class framework:
        - Generalize ... it's not just for PC/AT style RTCs, and there
          may be more than one RTC per system.
        - Not all RTCs expose the same feature set as PC/AT ones; most
          of these ioctls will be rejected by some RTCs.
        - Be explicit about when {A,P}IE_{ON,OFF} calls are needed.
        - Describe the parameter to the get/set epoch request; correct
          the description of the get/set frequency parameter.
        - Document RTC_WKALM_{RD,SET}, which don't need AIE_{ON,OFF} and
          which support longer alarm periods.
        - Hey, not all system clock implementations count timer irqs any
          more now that the new RT-derived clock support is merging.
raw.7
udp.7
    Andi Kleen
        Describe the correct default for UDP/RAW path MTU discovery.

Cheers,
Michael
