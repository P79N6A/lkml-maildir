Well, I would have liked to see the ACPI poweroff fix I sent a few days ago,
but Len said he doesn't have time to review it this week. It's a shame since
at least two of my machines which powered off correctly with very older ACPI
versions now need it, so I don't think I'm the only one in this case :-(
Other than that, I'm fairly happy with at least -rc2 (not tested latest
releases yet).
Cheers,
Willy
