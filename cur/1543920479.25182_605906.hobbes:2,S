But it *is* a key press!

I think Dmitry is wrong here. Input is the right layer for sending 
keypress information to userland.

Well, yes, we could have a layer in the kernel to turn the key events 
into ACPI events and then let the video module turn them back into input 
events, but that still wouldn't deal with the fact that legacy Dell 
backlight control isn't going to happen in the kernel.
Anyway. My point was that saying we shouldn't put notification events 
through the input layer is at odds with reality - we already do, and 
they already arrive with EV_KEY. Userspace copes. Who benefits from 
doing it in any other way? Userspace doesn't - we'd need to rewrite 
parts of it to deal with the new setup. The kernel doesn't, because it 
doesn't consume these events itself. Coming up with a "cleaner" 
interface just results in more work for everyone. We should just go with 
the defacto standard, especially since it's one that's been implemented 
by various hardware vendors.
