Hmm, interesting idea. The one thing is: There are 23 fields in struct 
net_device_stats right now; if each of them is 64bits (=8 bytes), the whole 
structure would be 184 bytes (with u_int64.) Now if I have two of each, the 
size would grow to 368 bytes (plus the 4 bytes for counter_bounce). Now, the 
question: would it be acceptable to have something that size?
Jeff.
