I understand that the answer is No. (first from the Schimmel's book and
then from Andi's email).
Well, it turns out that for read_maps() it does not really matter as it
tries to get a GFP_KERNEL page *before* getting the lock so we never sleep
holding a lock.
Therefore, I shall redo my previous fs/proc/array.c 
"tasklist_lock FIXMEs fixed" patch with one major
difference - this time I *know* exactly what I am doing :)
Regards,
Tigran.
