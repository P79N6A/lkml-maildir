As I see it, basically if I send mail to linux-kernel@vgerxxx, it should
be "refused", not simply received and ignored, if I haven't subscribed
to the list. This should stop automatic mail senders from sending again.
If I run a mail-sender, sex.porno.org, I of course could subscribe to
the list. However, a periodic review of the subscribers by a person
could uncover this kind of abuse. Since the list is huge, this would
require work to be spread out over a period of time so the reviewer(s)
would have to keep track of the last email addresses reviewed.
This is a lot of work. However, certain helpers could be emailed
sections of the list periodically by the moderator. They could edit
the section at their leisure, and send the edited section back to the
moderator.
If I were to get a copy of a section weekly, I could certainly
review/edit it and send it back. I'm sure there are a few hundred
others who would volunteer also.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
