Dmitry,
   See the patch I just posted to acpi-devel and lkml (Subject:
[PATCH/RFC] exposing ACPI objects in sysfs).  It exposes acpi objects as
you describe.   Something simple like:
 # cat /sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/LSB0/_EJ0
Will call the _EJ0 method on the ACPI device.  You can evaluate eject
dependencies using the _EJD method.
