trustix.co.id?  hehehe.
If you don't want to login with user/password, then change your
password to "".  Don't want to even do that?  Then just change
/etc/inittab to invoke "login -f username" instead of mingetty or
whatever.  No need at all to hack the kernel up.
Dunno why you sent the patch here or to Linus though..  The
chance of it even being looked at are about 1/2^infinity  ;o)
I've got a hacked up version of mingetty that allows you to
configure autologins on tty's if you like.  You're welcome to my
packages if you like just email me privately. It is useful if you
are in an environment where physical security is not a concern at
all, but network security is still a concern.  I use it so I can
boot up, login once, and it fires up tty's on all consoles for
me.  It can also bypass any login if you like.
