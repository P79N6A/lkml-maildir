x86-64 does it in a different way. It just handles the 
possible exception on FXRSTOR with an __ex_table handler.
With that all the mxcsr masking can be dropped.
It was already this way for 64bit programs, but the 32bit emulation
still masks. I'm not sure I can change that - in theory it could
break existing programs.
