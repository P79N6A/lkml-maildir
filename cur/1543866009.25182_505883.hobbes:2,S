I don't think you've ever showed any such example.
And if you did, it would all boil down to *exactly* what 'select' does: 
config options that get set automatically based on other choices.
So care to give a real example? Start with USB automatically selecting 
SCSI support without the user having to even know it uses SCSI. Tell me 
how it's supposed to work sanely without 'select'.
Put up, or shut up.
