Hi, 
I tried to compile linux-2.5.38 with Frame-buffer support enabled.
I chose the "nVidia Riva support" in "Frame-buffer support" section.
Making "make dep clean" works OK. But, when I began "make bzImage",
I got the following error message, which is attached to this mail via
"error.log". I, also attached my ".config" file and "ver_linux" output.
I hope, these help to resolve this problem. If need more info, please
mail me.
