Practically, the information can go through subsystem maintainers to
specific person (you) in such a case, as the tree is still more or
less maintained by subsystem maintainers.
But in general, it would be nice to have an easy way to find a
maintainer (not author) from a module binary, and I agree
MODULE_MAINTAINER can work well for such a purpose.  It's no mandatory
field, but could be some help.
