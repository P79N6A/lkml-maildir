Hi all,
Here's a work in progress series whcih does a partial revert of the
previous swiotlb changes, and does a partial replacement with Becky
Bruce's series.
The most important difference is Becky's use of phys_addr_t rather
than page+offset to represent arbitrary pages.  This turns out to be
simpler.
I didn't replicate the map_single_page changes, since I'm not exactly
sure of ppc's requirements here, and it seemed like something that
could be easily added.
Quick testing showed no problems, but I haven't had the chance to do
anything extensive.
I've made some small changes to Becky's patches to make them apply,
but I've separated any functional changes into separate patches with
appropriate authorship.
