It is _not_ a POSIX rule, as I and others have shown.  You claimed it
was required by POSIX, but you are quite clearly incorrect.  It has
never worked that way with Unix systems, and POSIX was always designed
to codify existing practice.  On Unix systems fixed disks would and
did have their devices numbering schemes move around under a number of
conditions.

_Needs to happen_?  According to whom?
And by your definition, if it _needs_ to happen "in all cases", then
clearly since Solaris can be confused in this particular way, your
favorite operating system is also "broken", yes?  And if you still
claim that it is a "Posix rule", then by your reasoning Solaris must
not be Posix compliant either.  Go ahead and tell your OpenSolaris
friends that, and see what they say.  :-)
