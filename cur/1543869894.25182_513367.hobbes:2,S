It seems you like to repeate that white is white and it is not black :)
Did you see what I wrote in previous e-mail to you?
No, you do not.
I wrote that both model should co-exist, and boundary between the two is
not clear, but for described workloads IMO event driven model provides
way too higher performance.
That is it, Linus, no one wants to say that you say something stupid -
just read what others write for you.
Thanks.
