Then how are you supposed to access all 64GB of RAM in your machine?  The
kernel must be able to access all 64GB of RAM at once, otherwise it can't do
proper memory management.
I've been reading on the PAE in Intel's manuals.  I admit, some of it is over
my head.  I was under the impression that it was 16:32->64->36 with PAE enabled.
