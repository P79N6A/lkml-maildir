That lets you control who can use the interface at all, but not what
operations they can invoke on it.

Do any of the interfaces allow a task to act on a cache other than one
it has created?  How does the task identify the desired cache?  What if
there is a conflict between multiple tasks asking for the same cache?

Not necessarily.
secid is being applied as the acting context for the cachefiles kernel
module, so the above makes sense, even though there isn't really any
"object" in view here.  Abstractly, the question we are asking above is:
Can this task set the context of the cachefiles kernel module to this
value?
