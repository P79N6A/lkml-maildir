Subject: How to compile x86 kernels on Opteron (Fedora core 3)?

Hello!
I am trying to compile a 2.4.27 kernel for pentium-2 on an x86_64 Opteron
system (Fedora Core 3).  I tried editing the Makefile to add -m32 to the gcc
argument, and I added ARCH=i386 to all of the 'make' commands.
The first problem I see is that /sbin/genksyms does not exist on FC3.  I am
not sure where this is supposed to come from, but I coppied a version
from an different machine and it seems to work OK...
After that, the build still fails, complaining about conflicting types for
various things:
home/greear/kernel/2.4/linux-2.4.27.p2/include/asm/unistd.h:375: warning: conflicting types for built-in function '_exit'
...
sched.c:213: error: conflicting types for 'reschedule_idle'
sched.c:210: error: previous declaration of 'reschedule_idle' was here
sched.c:213: error: conflicting types for 'reschedule_idle'
sched.c:210: error: previous declaration of 'reschedule_idle' was here
I also tried building in a debian chroot (the binaries there is regular i386).
This mostly worked but it failed to build something down in the aic scsi code...
So, has anyone got a recipe for cross-compiling regular x86 2.4 and/or 2.6 kernels on an
x86_64 system?
Thanks,
Ben
