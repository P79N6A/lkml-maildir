No this is no longer true. For example last night I displayed the 16 color 
logo perfectly fine on a 16 bpp display!!!! The mono display still has 
bugs tho. The new logo tries to pick the best image to display. Say for 
example we have two video cards. One running VESA fbdev at 16 bpp and a 
another at vga 4 planar via vga16fb. This way we can have the both the 16 
color and 224 color logo compiled in.  The correct logo will be displayed 
then on the correct display. Now say we only have a mono display but all 
the cards support 8 bpp or better. That logo still gets displayed.
