Subject: [RFC][TRIVIAL] Print a KERN_INFO after a module gets loaded
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi all,
After some thinking (nothing serious) I came up with the idea of print a 
KERN_INFO after a module got loaded, why? Think about this, some guy 
inserts a LKM rootkit, obviously that module (think adore or knark) 
doesn't say anything when it gets loaded. In this cases is useful to have 
this feature, another example can be simply now the order of a group of 
pre-requisite modules when you load something using modprobe(8).
Before doing this I searched the web, readed some docs and asked on 
#kernelnewbies, it seems there's no standard way to log the insertion of a 
module.
I'm not sure if this is the right way to do this, I'm just adding a printk 
after the module gets initialized, perhaps it must be done somewhere else, 
comments/flames are welcome.
This is pretty useful, at least for me 8) (the printk, not the flames)
Best Regards 
PS: Oops, I forgot, this applies happily against 2.4.18 and 2.5.21
