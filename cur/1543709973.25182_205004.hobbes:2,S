So you can tell them apart.  See ohci_endpoint_disable().
You seem to think small races are OK.  I disagree.  The smaller the
race, the harder it is to debug (and yes, it _will_ bite you
eventually).  With my patch, you're _guaranteed_ that ED_IDLE means
the HC doesn't refer to the ED anymore so you can free the memory and
do whatever you want without worry about potentially causing the HC to
do something bad.

With my patch, the only reason you enter ED_UNLINK state is
ohci_endpoint_disable().  If you try to ohci_urb_enqueue() on an ED in
this state, it will fail, so I don't there is a problem (I see now
that I forgot to set the error-code for this case, that's obviously
something that needs to be fixed).  But perhaps you had different
semantics in mind for ED_UNLINK?

Meaning what?  Please explain what sequence of events would cause
problems that could be solved by flushing the posted writes.  AFAICT,
the flushes are just expensive NO-OPs in this particular case.
