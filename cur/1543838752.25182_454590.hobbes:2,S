At first, Thanks.
question:
	task = get_pid_task(find_next_pid(tgid), PIDTYPE_PID);
Does this return only "task/process" ? and never return "thread" ?
My another concern is that newly-created-process while ps running cannot be catched
by this kind of "table walking" approach (as my previous work)
But if people say O.K, I have no complaint.
I(we)'ll post another list-based one in the next week, anyway.
(I can't go-ahead this week...)
