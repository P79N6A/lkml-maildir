As recommended elsewhere in this thread, I'm not using any sort of framebuffer 
driver, but vesafb IS compiled in (but no vga= option is present). Does it 
need to be compiled out completely?
I have acpi_sleep=s3_bios on cmdline. I am not using swsusp2 (and I can't see 
how this is at all related to software suspend).
Perhaps it is the machine BIOS. Which version do you have?
