I agree, but please note that the child_reaper is not the only issue. Think
about sub-thread which auto-reaps itself. I'd suggest to add the comment in
do_exit() after exit_notify() to remind that the task is really dead now, it
has no ->signal, it can't be seen in /proc/, we can't send a signal to it, etc.
