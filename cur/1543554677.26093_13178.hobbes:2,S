This brings another question. Has there been any work done to force linux 
to reboot on all panics? Linux's propensity to crash drivers (say the 
network card driver) and leave the system running make linux unusable in 
unattended environments as the machine is functionally dead.
a simple switch that forces reboot on panic would do much to alleviate the 
problem.
