If there is no compile error, it is probably mismatched modules, because
preempt_schedule is properly exported.
Make sure your kernel tree is fully patched and CONFIG_PREEMPT is
enabled.  Rerun `make dep' and then recompile (including your modules). 
Make sure your modules are properly installed.
Either your running kernel doesn't have preemption enabled or your
kernel does but your modules don't (i.e. they are old modules).
