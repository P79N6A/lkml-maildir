Does it always generate a 64bit .config or randomly a 32bit or 64bit 
.config?
As far as I see it's the latter.
If the unified x86 architecture should be presented as one 
architecture in kconfig that's expected - and it might even reduce the 
amount of 32bit compile errors that recently occured in the git-x86 
tree...
