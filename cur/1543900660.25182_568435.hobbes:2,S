Don't you want assemble rather than create if it already exists?
How did two drives fail at the same time?  Are you running PATA drives
with two drives on a single cable?  That is a no no for raid.  PATA
drive failures often take out the bus and you never want two drives in a
single raid to share an IDE bus.
You probably want to try and assemble the non failed drives, and then
add in the new replacement drive afterwards, since after all it is NOT
clean.  Hopefully the raid will accept back sda even though it appeared
failed.  Then you can add the new sdc to resync the raid.
