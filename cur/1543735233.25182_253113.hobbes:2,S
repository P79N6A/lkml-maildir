I don't see the order mattering as far as breaking things,
but might matter a little for performance.
(depending on the particular ldisc implementation)
wake_up_interruptible(&tty->write_wait) should
come after the ldisc write_wakeup (as is done in tty_io.c)
so that send data buffered by the ldisc
can be sent to the driver before trying to process
more send data from a sleeping user context.
The various serial drivers make the two calls for
the same reason: the driver has become capable of
accepting more data. That the drivers make the
calls in different order points back to the
order not mattering for strictly functional purposes.
*BUT*
You made a statement about reworking tty locking
one step at a time, and concentrating on the ldisc
locking first.
In that light, it might be better to factor out the
wake_up_interruptible(&tty->write_wait) calls
after the ldisc locking is complete and integrated.
