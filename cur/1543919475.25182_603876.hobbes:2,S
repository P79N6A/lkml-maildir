That *is* the SELinux policy which does what Smack does.  I keep  
having bugs in the perl-script I'm writing on account of not having  
the time to really get around to fixing it, but that is exactly the  
procedure for generating an SELinux policy from a SMACK policy.

I'd love to have time to finish the script but unfortunately real  
life keeps interfering and I'm going to have to go back to lurking on  
this thread.
