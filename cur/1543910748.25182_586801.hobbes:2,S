Some thoughts ,
In the -mm kernel there is some debugging that gets injected into the
likely/unlikely macros .. If they get called from userspace it causes a
hang .. We might want to add some new set of macros to specifically
denote that they are called from userspace, not just likely/unlikely but
all the macros so we don't get mixed usage ..
