   As I pointed out earlier the kernel will fail to compile if you select
a joystick and don't select usb/input support. I submitted a patch before
but it wasn't accepted. So I made a much more watered down patch to fix
the problem. The plan is to submit a bunch of smaller patches instead of
one big one.
   This patch creates a input directory which allows you to select input
support without having to compile usb support in. This patch then only
allows you to select a joystick you want when you have selected to use
the input drivers. Right now only usb drivers are in the input directory. 
Even watered down its a good size. The files in the usb directory are a
good size.
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
