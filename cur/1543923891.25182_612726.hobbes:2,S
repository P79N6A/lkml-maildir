Hi Domen,
I'd like to see what Sam says also.
Using a separate Kconfig probably won't help much since this construct:
if PPC_52xx
source "Kconfig.fec"
endif
will still be read/parsed by kconfig software.  I.e., the "if" line
just adds a dependency to the config symbols in Kconfig.fec.  It does
not keep the file from being read/parsed.
