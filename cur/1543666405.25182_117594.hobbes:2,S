It's incorrect like I told you last time. arg 4 is in r10. Linus please don't
apply.
The clone prototype is 
	int clone(int flags, unsigned long newsp, void *parent_tid, void *child_tid) ;
	rax: __NR_clone
	rdi: flags
	rsi: newsp 
	rdx: parent_tid
	r10: child_tid
See appendix A of the x86-64 ABI for details.	 The kernel ABI 
is different from the user space ABI because of the SYSCALL clobbers.
For exit_group please wait for my next merge.
