Hi all!
I've read the thread here and the kernel-traffic about the Promise
Fasttrack PDC20376 (or known as Fasttrack S150 TX2plus) driver.
Well, I've got an ASUS A7V8X maindboard with this on-board SATA
controller and I've heard, that there's support for this in the FreeBSD
kernel.
I've tried it and this information was true. The controller works, I can
mount partitions on this controller without any mistake.
But!
I doesn't know the C language, so I can't port into the kernel.
So. Can anyone port the driver from FreeBSD?
Thanx for the answer.
