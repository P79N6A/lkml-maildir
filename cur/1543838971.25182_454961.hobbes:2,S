Good point. I've not spent enough time looking at the RTC code, and it
looks like it has potential to resolve some of the issues I'm looking
at. Although, how common is it really? Could we currently replace all
arches xtime initialization code with it? I suspect that would require
it to be built at all times. Would that be acceptable?

Yea. Although late initialization isn't that much of an issue in my
mind.

SOC?

That's fair. While the patch I just sent didn't consider these cases, I
don't think these scenarios break the intent of what I'm wanting to do.

Agreed.
Basically what I'm trying to provide w/ read_persistent_clock() is:
1) A method for generic timekeeping to access a battery backed clock to
avoid potential suspend/resume ordering problems.
2) A generic interface to a low-res hardware driven clock for the
hangcheck-timer and other watchdog timers.
3) To cleanup the arch time initialization code and encapsulate xtime
Do you think the RTC interface is sufficient for this?
Thanks, I appreciate the feedback!
