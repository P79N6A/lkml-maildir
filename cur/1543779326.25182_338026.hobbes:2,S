Pavel picked up that (incomplete) list up from my email, and I was just 
assuming defconfig to be the desktop config.  If that feature were done 
cleanly though, we could have any number of blah-configs, and maybe even 
split desktops into low-latency or low-resources options.  It'd be neat 
to get preempt and everything on just by saying:
   make desktop-lowlatency-config
Then again, maybe that idea will fly like pigs; we'll see.
