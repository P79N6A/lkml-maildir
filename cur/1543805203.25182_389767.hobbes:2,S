I think when we are able to demonstrate that it allows us to do more than
the current built-in swsusp in terms of performance, security etc.  Of course
we'll need some userland utilities for this purpose.

Yes.

I think they'll find the interface useful.  I've been using it for a couple of
weeks now and it really allowed me to do some tricks that are just impossible
with the current implementation.

Well, actually I've taken this stuff verbatim from LDD3.

I thought about it, but this would increase the complexity of
snapshot_read_next() by two orders of magnitude, and this function is also
called by the built-in code which doesn't use the read-less-than-one-page-at-a-time
functionality anyway, so I decided against it.

Pavel should know. ;-)

Because we use __put_user() down the road?
The problem is if the address is wrong we should not try to call
alloc_swap_page() at all.  If we did, we wouldn't be able to return the result
and we would leak a swap page.

Yes, it should.
I'll post a small fix on top of this patch if you don't mind.
