Note that even active defrag won't be able to handle the case where you 
want have lots of big pages, consituting a large percentage of available 
memory.
Not unless you think I am crazy enough to do garbage collection on kernel

Also, I think the jury (ie Andrew) is still out on whether rmap is worth 
it.
