I file that under "hiding bugs", since it will not be immediately 
obvious to a bug hunter or maintainer what the real problem is.
If a driver is broken on 64-bit, please add "&& !64BIT" to the Kconfig.
As you yourself just explained, your wish is to use CONFIG_ISA, but your 
intent is only coincedentally related to ISA.
