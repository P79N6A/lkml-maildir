Subject: [PATCH] Another one ISA PnP modem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch adds the USR Courier INT (one of them?) into the list of
the PnP devices IDs in 8250_pnp.  Before the patch this modem hasn't
been activated by 8250_pnp.
For the description inside a comment I used what the modem tells about
itself literally - 'USRobotics' vs. 'U.S. Robotics' used elsewhere in
the file.  May be it is undesirably?
Please, apply the patch.
