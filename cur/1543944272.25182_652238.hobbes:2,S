I think that part is actually mostly ok now (old kgdb stubs were
much worse in this regard) 
I still think the ultimative proof for this would be working
"modprobe kgdb" though.

While agreed in theory there are some exceptions: any time an oops
happens or a crash dump would happen automatically kgdb should definitely
do something very visible. Unfortunately that's not always the case
currently (see earlier comments on the notifier priority)

The problem here is that the timeout we were talking about 
is not integrated into the kgdb event loop, it is rather the loop
that protects the event loop. If you hang there all input
from the outside will be ignored.

If you want areally simple kgdb the best option would be re-porting
the really simple (tm) 2.4 era x86-64 kgdb stub I did long ago.
It had a small fraction of the code size of the current code, but
was also missing a lot of features of course.
