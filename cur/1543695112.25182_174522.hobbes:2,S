Hi,
2.4.23-pre7 doesn't recognize the second processor on a supermicro
board with Intel E7505 dual Xeon. (It runs fine on a dual P3 machine)
The 2.4.22-AC4 kernel recognizes both (even 4 of hyperthreading is
enabled)
Since we are still looking for a remedy to a kernel freeze (here on at
least two different SMP machines) when using a GL-application with and
WITHOUT the Nvidia video kernel module, we were hoping that the
recent fix for a race condition in mmap could help.
Any hints are appreciated,
