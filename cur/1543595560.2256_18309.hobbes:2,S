the "more worse" part is the only thing which is wrong. The fact cache
also grows to 110M is expected and it won't change. With the
blkdev-pagecache patch the cache will grow to 220M and it will shrink to
110M if you are low on memory (buffer cache will only be allocated for
the superblock and inode metadata with ext2).
use ramfs if you want zero ram duplication and you don't care about the
physical representation on disk of your data in cache.

Try this patch to fix the "more worst part"  (beware totally untested).
