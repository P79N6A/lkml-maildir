You will want to start a new thread (change the subject line) since
this post is completely unrelated to the patch it references.
As for your question I'm probably not the best person to ask, about
those topics, but if you are looking for a kernel reference
http://lxr.linux.no/
 is invaluable. Linux Device Drivers 3 looks like
a good reference for driver coding too, I just bought it. Greg KH
would certainly recommend it to you since he is a co-author ;-).
Good luck,
Yani
