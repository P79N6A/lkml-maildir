Hi guys,
I hibernated without BT donle (CSR based 16.1.1 fw)  plugged into USB port and 
started with it plugged in and kernel after successfully loaded image from 
hdd freezes saying USB device plugged in and info about usb port...
After press reset kernel started recovering ext3 fs, but all my data are 
lost...
PLS fix it in future releases
Thanks
Michal
