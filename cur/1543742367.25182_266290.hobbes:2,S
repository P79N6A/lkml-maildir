Having the source file in same directory as the result file is a
pattern used all over the kernel. Moving the .c file to include/asm-xxx
just made this true for offsets.h.
In this process a renaming took place so the name of the source file
and the result file match except for the extension.
Some architectures had: asm_offsets.c => offsets.h
A non-logical renaming.
As for the idea of having source file located in a separate
directory. It's not supported by kbuild today, and I'm reluctant
to support it - since it usually triggers misuse.
kbuild is about making the trivial stuff easy, but not about full
flexibility. If we wanted full flexibility we would not have used
so much effort to define a simple syntax.
