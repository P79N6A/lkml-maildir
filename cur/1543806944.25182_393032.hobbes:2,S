But Avi is still correct about false positives.  For example, if
something stomps on the slab poison and leaves it as
    e0 08 03 00
then that will add up to eb and still trigger your message, even
though it's far from a single bit error.
Maybe making the loop be something like
	unsigned char total = 0, bad_count = 0;
	printk(KERN_ERR "%03x:", offset);
	for (i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
		if (data[offset+i] != POISON_FREE) {
			total += data[offset+i];
			++bad_count;
		}
		printk(" %02x", (unsigned char)data[offset + i]);
	}
and then you can put
	if (bad_count == 1)
before the switch statement.
I have to admit that Avi's code seems clearer to me too, though.
