I don't understand what you mean, sorry.
Userspace programs must open with O_LARGEFILE to go over 2G. This is true
regardless of the underlying FS. You can find the details in the specs.
On the server side nfsd must open files with O_LARGEFILE as well if it wants to
return data over 2G to the nfsv2/3 clients that are asking for that (see it as
a kernel internals implementation detail: we for sure want to re-use the common
routines inside nfsd even if it's in kenrel space). The |O_LARGEFILE at line
472 and 476 of linux/fs/nfsd/vfs.c of 2.4.0-test10-pre4 are strictly necessary
(they're present in 2.2.18pre17aa1 as well indeed).
