I'd suggest not having a lock at all, but instead add two functions: one
to read a 64-bit value atomically, the other to write it atomically (and
they'd be atomic only wrt each other, no memory barriers etc implied).
On 64-bit architectures that's just a direct dereference, and even on x86
it's just a "cmpxchg8b".
