Hi,
I was I trouble with my 3c940 gigabit NIC on my Debian Sid this latest 
kernel 2.6.15 self-compiled...
I wondered why ethtool was not able to get/set WoL status while the 
readme available on the sysKonnect website says sk98lin supports WoL :
http://www.syskonnect.com/syskonnect/support/driver/readme/linux/sk98lin.
html
So I looked at Documentation/networking/sk98lin.txt on my 2.6.15 tree :
sk98lin.txt created 13-Feb-2004
Readme File for sk98lin v6.23
And on drivers/net/sk98lin/h/skdrv1st.h :
 * Name:        skdrv1st.h
 * Project:     GEnesis, PCI Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
 * Version:     $Revision: 1.4 $
 * Date:        $Date: 2003/11/12 14:28:14 $
 * Purpose:     First header file for driver and all other modules
But on the syskonnect website, I downloaded a really more recent revision 
(Version: 8.28.1.3, Date: 29:09:2005) at this url :
http://www.skd.de/e_en/support/driver_searchresults.html?navid=13
&action=search&configurationId=e_en.downloads_support&term=typ.treiber+Li
nux+SK-9521&searchTerm=&produkt=SK-9521&typ=typ.treiber&system=Linux
A look on drivers/net/sk98lin/h/skdrv1st.h from this archive :
 * Name:	skdrv1st.h
 * Project:	GEnesis, PCI Gigabit Ethernet Adapter
 * Version:	$Revision: 1.5.2.6 $
 * Date:	$Date: 2005/08/09 07:14:29 $
 * Purpose:	First header file for driver and all other modules 
So this archive is more recent than sources included in stock kernel, but 
older than 2.6.14 kernel, so I wonder why this revision of sk98lin is not 
included in kernel ?
I firstly thinked about some GNU license violation, but header files 
still refer to GNU license... So what's the matter with this driver ?
Thanks for your attention,
