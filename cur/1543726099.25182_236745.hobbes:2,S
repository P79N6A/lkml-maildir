Con Kolivas' 2.6.8-rc1-ck6 snapshot patch seems fix the problem.  Not 
only is my audio not corrupted when i write a disk but I get no mem leak 
situation and thus no OOM.  I did 5 dummy burns with no swap being used 
and stable vm statistics, final real burn resulted in successful disc.
2.6.8-rc1 2.6.8-rc1-mm both flipped out.  ck touches all relevent files 
so something the patch does fixed whatever was wrong.
