So I do a 'make silentoldconfig', and I get:
*
* Generic Driver Options
*
path to uevent helper (UEVENT_HELPER_PATH) [/sbin/hotplug] (NEW)
(Hey wow - the patch has a 'help' section, but no '?' listed because it's not a
bool or tristate. You can apparently get help during 'make menuconfig' but not
'make *oldconfig'. That rocks. ;)
Yeeh. Hah. I don't *have* a /sbin/hotplug on this udev-based Fedora box.  But
wait, reading the patch says that's usually during early boot. Now to figure
out what /sbin/nash does with its onboard 'hotplug' command... ;)
(In other words, this *really* needs some better help documentation, to explain
who needs this, and who doesn't need it, and what happens if you select it
and you shouldn't have, and what happens if you leave it out when you should
have set it....)
