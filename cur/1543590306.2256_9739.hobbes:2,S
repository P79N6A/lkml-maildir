Hi,
Sorry for breaking the thread, but I only read l-k through www archives,
so...
This problem is fixed in CVS.  Apply:
http://vger.samba.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/linux/net/ipv6/ndisc.c.diff?r1=1.49&r2=1.50&cvsroot=vger
And you'll be fine.
Please Cc: if follow-ups.

I have just reproduced that on 2.4.5pre-1. It was only one ping (ping6)
(from the other side of ipv6 over ipv4 tunnel.

My configuration is without any ipv6/netfilter modules - all build in
kernel.
