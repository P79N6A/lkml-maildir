I pulled down the git tree, compiled and installed it.  I tested it
against the OProfile testsuite, which includes SPU event profiling
tests.  Everything passed.  The patch I submitted was against a 2.6.26
tree.  You are now on a 2.6.28 tree so perhaps that is why the patch did
not apply cleanly.  The patch has been out there for some time.
