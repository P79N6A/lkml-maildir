Hallo kernel developers.
Praparing new include file for strace, I have found following trouble-making
dependencies in includes (2.1.132):
linux/serial167.h and linux/cyclades.h are not includable at once (many redundancies)
linux/lp_m68k.h and linux/lp.h if loaded in this order, some lp.h defines are not accepted.
linux/joystick.h is broken by scsi/scsi.h (BUSY)
Needed for linux/fb.h:
#include <linux/tty.h>
Needed for linux/isdn_ppp.h
#include <linux/ppp_defs.h>
Needed for linux/nfsd/export.h:
#include <linux/sunrpc/svc.h>
#include <linux/nfsd/nfsfh.h>
Needed for scsi/scsi_ioctl.h (defined in drivers/scsi/scsi.h, but no include)
typedef struct scsi_device Scsi_Device;
Probably more files depends on linux/types.h, but not includes it.
