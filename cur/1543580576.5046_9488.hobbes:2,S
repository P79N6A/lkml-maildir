It wouldn't do any good.  Many months ago, Ted Ts'o pleaded with
Richard Gooch (devfs author, from Australia) to switch to the American
spelling of the word, for consistency with the rest of the kernel, and
nothing came of it.  At this point you may as well consider
'/dev/discs' an "interface set in stone".  (Come on, do *you* want to
explain to thousands of people why their /etc/fstab suddenly broke?)
