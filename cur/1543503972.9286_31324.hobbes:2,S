   The PCI specs require all devices to decode 32 bits of I/O address, but
they allow upper 16 bits to be hard-wired to zero. It's possible there
really are devices ignoring this part of specs, but probably only an experiment
can prove it.
   Due to ISA address decoding brain-damages, everyone has to assign PCI
I/O regions addresses which modulo 0x400 give less than 0x100 or addresses
above 64K which are not forwarded to ISA at all. This is problematic when
a region has more than 256 bytes of I/O ports -- the PCI specs explicitly
forbid such large regions, but I know some such devices anyway.
				Have a nice fortnight
