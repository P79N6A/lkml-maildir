# Here's a patch that attempt to support the same functionality without
# inserting hooks into filesystem-specific code.  This patch permits the
# security module to perform initialization of the inode security state
# based on the superblock information, enabling SELinux to initialize
# pipe, devpts, and shm inodes without relying on inode_precondition to
# catch them on first use.
# 
# This is achieved simply by moving the initialization of inode->i_sb
# before the call to inode_alloc_security, enabling the
# inode_alloc_security hook function to perform the allocation and
# initialization for such inodes.  No new hooks are required.
