P2B-DS is a great, robust mainboard. This mail is written on one, and we 
have some more in production. Never had any problems with them.
Try deleting the OSS sound drivers under /lib/modules/*/kernel/sound/oss/ .
While I don't run fedora, I had similar problems with SuSE 9.1 and 9.2.
These boiled down to a problem with the el cheapo fm801 soundcard I 
plugged into the board.
The default installation installed an OSS driver that is not SMP-safe. 
After removing the driver, the correct ALSA driver got selected and 
everything was fine.
Hope this helps
Tim
