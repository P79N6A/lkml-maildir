Some may be able to reduce memory usage by reducing the number of running
processes (apache), or the size of memory caches (squid, netscape).
No programming magic required. I do agree it's quite useless.
It helps only if you reach OOS for a very transient cause. A runaway
process will thankfully eat up every newly freed space in a short time.
OOM / OOS should be avoided. Keep your critical system under control.
You have good reasons to do that anyway. Running a critical server
unattended just because 'it does not overcommit' is nonsense.
