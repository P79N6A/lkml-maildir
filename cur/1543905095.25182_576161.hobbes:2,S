	Once again linus blows a nut getting off about this and that. The fact
of the matter linus is a one sided. The fact is linus says what he wants
and people think he is god. The fact is noone get code in unless they
are a major player in a linux distro. Ingo had much advantage by using
fedora users. The fact Con did not take all bugs serious yes that is a
player of the game but linus is GOD so all bow before him before he
blows his back out while jacking off to his rants about how the kernel
and other projects should run.
