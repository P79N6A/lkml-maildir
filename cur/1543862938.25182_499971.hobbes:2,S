Still, edit all places and perhaps forget one and make sure all new code
doesn't forget about it, or pick a solution that covers everything.

I need full data traffic during OOM, not just a single ACK.

Jumbo frames are fine if the hardware can do SG-DMA..

SGI does networking too, right?

The kernel is special, right? It has priority over whatever user-land
does.

I'm not seeing that, with your approach nobody stops the kernel from
filling up the memory with user-space network traffic.
swapping is not some random user process, its a fundamental kernel task,
if this fails the machine is history.
