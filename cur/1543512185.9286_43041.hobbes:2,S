No, no, no. No one seems to understand the issues at stake here.
I have 2 modems, I plug modem A in first, it becomes (hypothetical)
device /dev/modem1. I plug in modem B second, it becomes /dev/modem2.
Now, I unplug both and plug modem B in first, it becomes modem1 now with
the current naming system.
This is completely unacceptable.
Does devfs solve this problem right now? No. Will it be easy to solve
this problem with devfs when an appropriate algorithm to name PnP
devices is created. Yes.

Please solve the above problem with an rc script. I have yet to see one
created and if you could do so, you would greatly advance adoption of
PnP in Linux.
