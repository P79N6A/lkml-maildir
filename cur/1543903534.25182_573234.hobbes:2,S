That's not needed for review. The final submission can then be
in a single patch. It's just impossible to read a really large
single patch. Ideally you space the posting also out over time.to not
tax the review resources too much.
Another standard trick for compileable patch series is to only add the 
Kconfig at the end.

No, you can ignore it then.

Probably not.

Yes smaller functions are better in general.
