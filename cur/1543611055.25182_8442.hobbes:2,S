OK. So there hasn't been much response for this BUG report. So I did a little 
investigating myself.
By use of objdump I get the impression that the Oops shows up when 
ip_dont_fragment is called (expanded). To be more specific: sk seems to be 
NULL.
This is rather weird. ip_queue_xmit2 is also the caller of nf_hook_slow (via 
ip_queue_xmit) at which time skb->sk must be OK. After nf_hook_slow things 
suddenly are wrong.
For the interrested I can send a disassembly listing with matching C lines.

Haven't had much response from either list. So I just report this to both.
