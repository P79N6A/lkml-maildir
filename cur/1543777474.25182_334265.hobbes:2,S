While reading this thread it occoured to me that perhaps what we
really want (besides sub HZ timers) might be for the kernel to
auto-tune HZ?
Would it make sense to introduce a new config option (say
CONFIG_HZ_AUTO) that when selected does something like this at boot:
if (running_on_a_laptop()) {
    set_HZ_to(250);
} else if (running_on_large_NUMA_box()) {
    set_HZ_to_100();
} else if (running_on_multimedia_box() {
    set_HZ_to_1000();
} else {
    set_HZ_to_some_other_sane_default();
}
and if user wants to not use the auto detection they can select a
certain HZ in their .config instead of CONFIG_HZ_AUTO.
Just wanted to throw the idea up in the air in case it made sense.
Feel free to pick it apart or simply ignore it. :-)
