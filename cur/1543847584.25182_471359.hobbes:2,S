What CPU is this? Pentium M?
What driver was getting used in 2.6.16 kernel to change freqency? Acpi-cpufreq?
Can you please make sure you have configured in both speedstep-centrino and acpi-cpufreq drivers. Things should work with both these drivers so that the best one will be used based on your BIOS support.
Thanks,
Venki
