You're wrong.
Exactly because "char" *by*definition* is "indeterminate sign" as far as 
something like "strlen()" is concerned.
"char" is _special_. Char is _different_. Char is *not* "int".

You're arguing some strange semantic difference in the English language.
I'm not really interested.
THE FACT IS, THAT "strlen()" IS DEFINED UNIVERSALLY AS TAKING "char *".
That BY DEFINITION means that "strlen()" cannot care about the sign, 
because the sign IS NOT DEFINED UNIVERSALLY!
And if you cannot accept that fact, it's your problem. Not mine.
The warning is CRAP. End of story.
