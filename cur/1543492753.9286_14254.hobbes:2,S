One way to avoid this would be to duplicate the (copy > (tp->max_window>>1))
check when the flags are set up (and hope that gcse won't find it). Because 
copy and *tp are likely in registers and the L1 cache redoing it is cheap.
Another crazy idea would be to declare psh volatile (=unregister @), but of
course this would need to be conditionalized to not hurt machines with 
enough registers (like the Merced).
