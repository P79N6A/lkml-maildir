I'm generally nervous about the idea of letting signalfd dequeue
somebody else private signals... even if we filter out SEGV's and
friends but I'll let Linus decide there.
Regarding the notifier, it's dodgy in most cases I'd say but I suppose
it should be allright to only worry about "current" and not the target
task there.
