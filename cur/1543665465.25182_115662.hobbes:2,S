That's a good start, but why not change that to a simple,
HOW_MANY_MINORS_I_WANT, which will work the same way now, but allow us
to change to a pure dynamic major/minor allocation scheme in the future
by only modifying the register_chr_device() code.  Same thing for
register_blkdev().
Although if we increase the width of dev_t then a need for dynamic
major/minors is pretty much gone...
