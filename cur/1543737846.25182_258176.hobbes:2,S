Might there be a similar effect for packets with bad IP or TCP checksums?
(

)
And as Bert says, Stevens mentions that with TCP accepts,
the other side might close before you call accept.
BTW this is why I insisted in JSR-51 that Java's NIO not allow
the use of Selector with blocking sockets:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SelectableChannel.html
"A channel must be placed into non-blocking mode before being
registered with a selector, and may not be returned to blocking mode until it has been deregistered."
So at least Java programs that use NIO are immune to this
particular user error (unless your implementation of NIO
relaxes this sanity check, tsk).
