I don't buy it.  What happens when there aren't enough clean pages in the 
system to achieve the high water mark?  I'm guessing we'd get a quick OOM (as 
observed by Peter).

You're assuming the system is static and won't allocate new pages behind your 
back.  We could be back to critically low memory before the write happens.
More broadly, we need to be proactive about getting dirty pages cleaned before 
they consume the system.  Deferring the write just makes it harder to keep 
up.
