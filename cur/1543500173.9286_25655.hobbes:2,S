Smbfs in 2.2.10 seems to still have a bug in it... I had mounted 
a directory from a Samba 2.0.2 server, and I was playing an mp3 file
from the directory with xmms. When I seeked 5 secs forward, xmms
hung (supposedly waiting i/o to complete), and smbf left in busyloop
writing the below lines to log. 
smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
smb_lookup: find //eniac failed, error=-5
smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
smb_lookup: find //eniac failed, error=-5
smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
smb_lookup: find //eniac failed, error=-5
smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
smb_lookup: find //eniac failed, error=-5
After I umounted the dir (it umounted just fine, that's good!), the below
lines were written to the log.
smb_retry: no connection process
smb_lookup: find //eniac failed, error=-5
smb_lookup: find //eniac failed, error=-5
This is fairly reproducible. If anybody is interested, I can tried to
reduce the problem to a simple test code.
As a side note: the dropping mounts in 2.2.9 seem now fixed.
