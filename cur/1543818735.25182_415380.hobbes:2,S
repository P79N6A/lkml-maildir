Because avoiding doing need_resched and reassessing priority at less regular 
intervals means less overhead, and there is always something else running on 
a pc. At low loads the longer timeslices and delayed preemption contribute 
considerably to cache warmth and throughput. Comparing staircase's 
sched_compute mode on kernbench at "optimal loads" (make -j4 x num_cpus) 
showed the best throughput of all the schedulers tested.

Installed and tested here just now. They run smoothly concurrently here. Are 
you testing on staircase15?

Only unblocked processes/threads where one depends on the other don't get 
equal share, which is as broken a testcase as relying on sched_yield. I have 
not seen a testcase demonstrating unfairness on current staircase. top shows 
me fair cpu usage.

Where do you stop calling something saturation and start calling it absurd? By 
your reckoning staircase is stable to loads of 300 on one cpu. spa being 
stable to higher loads is hardly comparable given the interactivity disparity 
between it and staircase. A compromise is one that does both very well; not 
one perfectly and the other poorly.

Have to think about that one. I'm not seeing a smoothness issue.

There is no problem with fairness that I am aware of.
Thanks!
