Yes it does.  If the variable is small, then the compiler may
expect the variable to be placed in the .sdata section, and so
be reachable by, say, a 16-bit gp-relative relocation.
Now, this variable in particular may not be small enough for
that, but the fact remains that the general rule should be that
variables should be declared with their section attributes.
