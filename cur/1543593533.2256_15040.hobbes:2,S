Maybe Joe's TCP slows things down by 200% for the average user, so it
will never go into the kernel proper.  However, it has one vital
feature that Bob needs that the faster (normal) stack can't offer.
Bob gains if he can make the choice.  If the 200% slower  and - some sum of $$
makes him choose Joes TCP, so be it.  Joes TCP could be open source, or
written by the devil himself, and the technical decision can still be made
by Bob.
Now, if there are legal issues with a proprietary loadable module, that may
be another topic of discussion altogether.  Is there any restriction
on what kind of module you can load?  For instance, suppose I write an ethernet
driver that has a built in TCP/IP stack in it somehow?  This may not be smart,
but it is technically possible...

Don't spite potential users just in the hope that you might be
able to spite a few companies too.  There is no need for Joe's
TCP to be non-open-source...a modular TCP stack might be a really
good option for making $$ though support fees...  If there is a
need to keep certain (proprietary) code out of the kernel, let
lawyers & public pressure do it, not overly broad technical restrictions.

Agreed.
