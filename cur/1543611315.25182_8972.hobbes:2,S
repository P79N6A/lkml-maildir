What would want want the down/up to do?  The reason I ask is that there is
an MII-DIAG option to reset the transceiver, if that's all you want to do.
If you want to remove/re-install the driver, then you have to clean up
all the links pointing to it (ie the routes associated with the
device), or you will have all kinds of nasty dangling pointers (logical
or otherwise) to clean up...
