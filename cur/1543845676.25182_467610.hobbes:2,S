Was a bit mystified by this as your patch matches what I've got
in my userspace test harness from 2003.
Here's what I submitted, which is almost the same as yours:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.11-rc4/2.6.11-rc4-mm1/broken-out/lib-sort-heapsort-implementation-of-sort.patch
Then Zou Nan hai sent Andrew a fix for an off-by-one bug here (merged
with my patch):
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.11/2.6.11-mm1/broken-out/lib-sort-heapsort-implementation-of-sort.patch
..which introduced the performance regression.
And then I subsequently tweaked my local copy for use in another
project, coming up with your version.
So this passes my test harness just fine (for both even and odd array
sizes).
