Yes. It is possible.
The funny observation is that it is legal.
If host does not know its address and send requests with zero address,
they look exaclty as DAD messages and, if target host is really present
on wire, it should answer with another arp request, containing the same
adresses and correct MAC address. Hence addressless peer updates its
ARP cache correctly. Nobody is offended, all are happy 8)8)
Certainly, dhcp should be fixed to avoid this, but it is not a big bug. 8)
