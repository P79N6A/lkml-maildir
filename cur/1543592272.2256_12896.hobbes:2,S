That is currently true, and the re-assignment of SRpnt is superfluous but
harmless. It is not a design constraint though that SRpnt cannot change
(except it can't change to NULL), so I prefer to leave the code as is.

The pointer aSRpnt is not useless, it's used to communicate the current
value of SRpnt throughout the driver.
