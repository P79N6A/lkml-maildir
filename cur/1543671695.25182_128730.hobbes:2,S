Well, I would really like to try this - but it seems that this laptop needs a 
special keyboard driver. It has a german keyboard layout and there is no way 
to get some special characters, especially "/".
Normally with german keyboards, "/" is mapped on the "-" key, but not on this 
one - some keys are simply dead, I can also not get the "[" and "\" etc. In 
"grub" there seems to be no way cut&paste the "/" from "root=/dev/hda3"
I will try to generate a bootdisk and append it with "rdev".
		Best Regards,
		Hermann
