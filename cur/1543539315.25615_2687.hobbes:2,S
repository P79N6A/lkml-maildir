Hi!
I'm going to install the 2.4 (test4) kernel for a raid-smp-machine  using a
mylex card (DAC960). 
The Mylex-driver can be compiled without troubles, however on restarting the
machine the DAC960 seems
to have a null-pointer (message from the driver)  and the kernel stops with
a panic message which seems to be a follow-up error. 
It seems that this pointer-mismatch is a heavy one, because I really must
switch off the machine. A normal reset loses e.g  the information about the
2nd processor.
I tried also the latest version from the author
(
http://www.dandelion.com/Linux
) for the 2.4-kernel - but it didn't help.
The former version for the 2.2.15-kernel is working well.

If you have a secure box and will bet your life on it, this is a non-issue
and I will go to sleep.
