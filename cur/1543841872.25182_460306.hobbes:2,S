Or every not-on-external-bus (usb/firewire/cardbus) device in laptop.
IMHO it's very good addition to everything-plug device driver model.
It must have its place in Documentation/driver-model/.

 It is important that drivers register their driver structure as early as
 possible. Registration with the core initializes several fields in the
 struct device_driver object, including the reference count and the
 lock. These fields are assumed to be valid at all times and may be
 used by the device model core or the bus driver.

 Transition Bus Drivers
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
 By defining wrapper functions, the transition to the new model can be
 made easier. Drivers can ignore the generic structure altogether and
 let the bus wrapper fill in the fields. For the callbacks, the bus can
