Interrupt service overhead varies a bit between architectures, but your
observation isn't too surprising.  While the 1000Hz Linux 2.6 default
is just bad craziness for embedded cores and FPGA prototypes, I've
only seen 100Hz be truly unusable for sub-megahertz hardware simulators,
and then only when running virtual SMP kernels, where multiple virtual
"CPUs" on the same core all had to perform timer interrupt service
every clock interval, which multiplies the proportion of available cycles
consumed.  But even if the system boots and runs, it's pretty scary
to look at the proportion of time that a 20MHz core spends in interrupt
service with a HZ value of 100 or more.
So on one hand I agree with Ralf that on slow systems, especially
FPGA systems, one wants to keep the clock interrupt frequency
down to no more than 100Hz as a general rule (less than 100
wouldn't compile on 2.6.9 without some minor patches, which
took the minimum down to HZ=48, below which the various macros
that depend on HZ start generating divide-by-zero problems),
while on the other hand I agree with Jan that it's by no means certain
that Satesh's problem is really one of too many clock interrupts.
