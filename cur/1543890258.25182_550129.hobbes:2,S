I tested this with my 2.6.22-rc3 kernel, here are the results:
without any special boot parameters: problem does appear
highres=off nohz=off: problem does not appear
highres=off: problem does not appear
nohz=off: problem does appear
I additionally built my 2.6.22-rc2-mm1 kernel without High Resolution Timer, 
but the high ping problem is still there.
