You should put aliases in /etc/conf.modules like:
alias scsi_hostadapter aic7xxx 
alias scsi_hostadapter sd_mod 
alias eth0 eepro100 
alias ppp-compress-21 ppp_deflate  <------------
alias ppp-compress-24 bsd_comp     <--------- Whatever modules you like
alias ppp-compress-26 equ          <------------
