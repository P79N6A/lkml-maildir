For keyboard.c, the test is :
        if (value < SIZE(func_table)) {
so it's reassuring that any value is contained in the table. We could hide
the warning with a cast of value to (int).
for vt.c, it's the same concept, some bounds are enforced on some values, and
in the event they would be violated, -EINVAL would be returned. So the check,
even if useless here, has some sense. Here again, a cast could hide the
warnings, but may generate useless code.
Cheers,
Willy
