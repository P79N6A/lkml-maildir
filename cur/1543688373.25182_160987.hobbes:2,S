Here we have it! In my opintion, the line
	clear_bit(TASKLET_STATE_SCHED, &t->state);
is just a _BUG_. The programmer _wanted_ to write
	set_bit(TASKLET_STATE_SCHED, &t->state);
In this case the function tasklet_kill _makes sense_ (beside
the problem of not working with recursive taskets)!
It will mostly be called in the cleanup function of a module 
and - yes - it would be useful.
So in my opintion
1. we should fix the bug (very easy)
2. we should find some means to make it usable for recursive tasklets.
