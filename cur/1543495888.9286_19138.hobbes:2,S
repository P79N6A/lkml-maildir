After spending the afternoon changing from a monolithic kernel to a modular one
I had an idea for an addition to the make process.
When an item is selected for an inline compile - if it has compile time options
they can be set.  Such as the soundblaster module.  Atleast in menuconfig when
you select it, you get a drop down under it with the compile time options, and
they can be set.
My suggestion is to have that same drop down if the item is a module.  In this
case it would be writing the module options to /etc/conf.modules
Same thing for ethernet cards that you can set paramiters for.
All in all it would seem a better way to do things then having to delv trough
the kernel module docs each time and find the options for that module, pop open
another xterm or toggle VTs, and edit conf.modules by hand.
With perhaps an toggle entry for this behavior in the kernel modules sub menu.
( yes, I'm expecting a little old lady to pipe up with "where's the patch?" )
