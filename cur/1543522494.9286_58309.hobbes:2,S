which is why (amongst other reasons) you will notice lock/unlock_kernel()
in sys_open() around call to filp_open(). (I just grabbed misc_open() as a
random example of calling request_module() and was satisfied that the code
is safe)
A good exercise would be to go through all calls and see if each case
provides such mutex against itself. Have you done that? :)
