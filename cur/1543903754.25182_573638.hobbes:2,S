on a PC you don't need to do that.

the cpu at full load.

even if the rest of the PC is unchanging (which it's not), it is just an
offset to both sides of the equation, and the same on both sides at
that.

on servers and such, there is a huge offset, sure, but still the effect
is there. And it really isn't 50%.

the same basic math holds for just 1 frame at a fixed rate. At some
point transition costs will get you (and that's where things like
ondemand delayed speedup will save us); but to get back to your
interface, the interface doesnt nearly give the info needed to make
these decisions...
