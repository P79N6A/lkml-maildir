Now, and it's VERY interesting at least for me (and is off-topic in
this thread) -- which drive(s) are good at NCQ?  I tried numerous SATA
(NCQ is about sata, right? :) drives, but NCQ either does nothing in
terms of performance or hurts.  Yesterday we ordered another drive
from Hitachi (their "raid edition" thing), -- will try it tomorrow,
but I've no hope here as it's some 5th or 6th model/brand already.
(Ol'good SCSI drives, even 10 years old, shows large difference when
TCQ is enabled...)
Thanks!
