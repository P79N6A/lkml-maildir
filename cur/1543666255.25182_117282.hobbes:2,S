Hi Justin,
Thanks for the info.
We were using these drivers as:
1. The 1.0.0 driver is as used in the Stock Redhat 7.3 release (updated
	to current updates).
2. The 1.1.0 driver is on the Adaptec web site for Linux and is I 		 
believe the one shipped on there CDROM for the on-board 7902
	controller.
We were not aware of a later driver.
For future reference, where should we go to find the latest drivers
for any device for the linux 2.4.x kernel ?
Do you know if the latest driver at 
http://people.FreeBSD.org/~gibbs/linux/RPM/aic79xx/
might fix this problem ?
Cheers
Terry
