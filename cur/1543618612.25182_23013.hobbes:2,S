Is there any way to stop the console scrolling during boot? My reason
for this is I am trying to troubleshoot a boot problem with
2.4.18-pre7 and I would like to give a more useful report than "it
won't boot" but the screen outputs information every few seconds and I
can't "freeze" the display so I can copy down the initial error(s).
This is an Intel unit using the standard console (not serial console).
pre7 will not boot but pre6 boots every time.
