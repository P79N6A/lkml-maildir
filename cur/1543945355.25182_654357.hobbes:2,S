Maybe you could try with some other debugging options? E.g. since lockdep
doesn't help - turn this off. Instead try some others, like these:
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP is not set
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCKING_API_SELFTESTS is not set
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT is not set
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_HIGHMEM is not set
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is not set
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is not set
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_SG is not set
> # CONFIG_BOOT_PRINTK_DELAY is not set
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW is not set
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE is not set
> # CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA is not set
