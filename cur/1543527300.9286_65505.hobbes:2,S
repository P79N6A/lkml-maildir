Who?  I'd like to see their code/ideas, etc..  Perhaps test out
existing effort...

The fb console is very slow, at least for me, and it causes many
apps on my system to not work anymore - like VMware,
etc...  There are other issues with it for me right now too.
I'd also like to have a separate scrollback buffer on each
console, and perhaps be able to configure what consoles have
scrollback, which don't and how big they are all at runtime, and
independant of any textmode changes that occur during runtime.
I've looked at the code and vc_resize() in console.c appears to
resize every single VC simultaneously.  I'd like to make it not
do that, but I assume it does for a good reason.  Anyone care to
explain why?  If no great reason exists, I'd like to hack it up
to work just for me...  I don't want to shoot myself in the foot
though in the mean time.
Any URL's to current efforts on this would be greatly
appreciated, as would comments from people working on such.
Thanks in advance!
