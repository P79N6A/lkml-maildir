Actually, as long as you have your system set up to route based on source
address (which you probably should if you care about strict arp replies)
arp_filter seems to work properly.  I just tested with a 2.4.18 box, with the
following address configuration:
[root@pcary1k5 /]# ip add
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP> mtu 16436 qdisc noqueue
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
    inet 127.0.0.1/8 brd 127.255.255.255 scope host lo
2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100
    link/ether 00:30:65:bf:46:ba brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 47.129.82.58/24 brd 47.129.82.255 scope global eth0
3: eth1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast qlen 100
    link/ether 00:50:ff:90:04:44 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 47.129.82.107/24 brd 47.129.82.255 scope global eth1
[root@pcary1k5 /]# ip ru
0:      from all lookup local
32764:  from 47.129.82.107 lookup 101
32765:  from 47.129.82.58 lookup 100
32766:  from all lookup main
32767:  from all lookup 253
[root@pcary1k5 /]# ip ro
47.129.82.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 47.129.82.58
47.129.82.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 47.129.82.107
127.0.0.0/8 dev lo  scope link
default via 47.129.82.1 dev eth0
[root@pcary1k5 /]# ip ro li table 100
47.129.82.0/24 dev eth0  scope link
default via 47.129.82.1 dev eth0
[root@pcary1k5 /]# ip ro li table 101
47.129.82.0/24 dev eth1  scope link
default via 47.129.82.1 dev eth1
With this setup, arp requests for 47.129.82.58 will only be answered by eth0,
and similarly for 47.129.82.107 and eth1.
