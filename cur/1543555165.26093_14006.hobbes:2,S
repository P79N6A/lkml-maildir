Werner,
Thanks for fix. Applied the patch and it's working now.
Linus, please add this patch to the kernel source codes for 2.4.0.
Under 2.2.18, it's working fine without the patch.
Thanks,
Jeff

Subject: [PATCH,RFC] initrd vs. BLKFLSBUF
Hi Al,
Jeff Chua reported a while ago that BLKFLSBUF returns EBUSY on a RAM disk
that was obtained via initrd. I think the problem is that the effect of
the blkdev_open(out_inode, ...) in drivers/block/rd.c:rd_load_image is
not undone at the end. I've attached a patch for 2.4.0-test11-pre7 that
seems to solve the problem. Since I'm not quite sure I understand the
reference counting rules there, I would appreciate your comment.
Thanks,
- Werner
