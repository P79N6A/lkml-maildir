Assignments (especially with things like &=) inside of conditionals
always make my head hurt for some reason.  So maybe something like the
below?
Although I'd be happier if we could get a comment from someone with a
better understanding of why this hack was added in the first place.
Thanks for the bug report!  (And, by the way, how did you run across
this?)

    nfsd: allow root to set uid and gid on create
    
    The server silently ignores attempts to set the uid and gid on create.
    Based on the comment, this appears to have been done to prevent some
    overly-clever IRIX client from causing itself problems.
    
    Perhaps we should remove that hack completely.  For now, at least, it
    makes sense to allow root (when no_root_squash is set) to set uid and
    gid.
    
    Thanks to Roger Willcocks <roger@filmlight.ltd.uk> for the bug report
    and original patch on which this is based.
