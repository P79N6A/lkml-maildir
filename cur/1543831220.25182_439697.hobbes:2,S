Hmm, good question - it's impossible to have a valid rec_len of 0 bytes.
There would need to be some special casing in the directory handling code.
Also, it breaks some of the directory sanity checking, and since "0" is
a common corruption pattern it isn't great to use.  We could instead use
0xfffc to mean 0x10000 since they are virtually the same value and the
error checking is safe.  It isn't possible to have this as a valid value.
Cheers, Andreas
