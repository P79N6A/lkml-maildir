Hello,
sometimes at boot I get the following from the logs:
ACPI: write EC, IB not empty
ACPI Exception (evregion-0409): AE_TIME, Returned by Handler for 
[EmbeddedControl] [20060127]
ACPI Error (psparse-0517): Method parse/execution failed 
[\_SB_.PCI0.ISA_.EC0_.SMRD] (Node c13ecd40), AE_TIME

ACPI Error (psparse-0517): Method parse/execution failed [\_SB_.BAT1.CHBP]

ACPI Error (psparse-0517): Method parse/execution failed

ACPI Error (psparse-0517): Method parse/execution failed 
[\_SB_.PCI0.ISA_.EC0_._Q09] (Node c13ecc40), AE_TIME
And after that the battery is reported as absent (even if it is physically 
present). I get the impression that this happens when rebooting, not 
from "cold powerons".
This did not happen in 2.6.15, it appeared somewhere in 2.6.16-rc series.
Regards,
  Francesco
