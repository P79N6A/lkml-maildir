I'm not clear on your point here.
If I stat a path and it exists then all is good and I'm done.
If I stat a path and I get something other than ENOENT then all is bad
and I return fail.
Otherwise I can just attempt to create the directory and fail if all is
bad with that.
This approach works in the current situation and would work for the
other situations in which that same process is used, not just for NFS
filesystems.
