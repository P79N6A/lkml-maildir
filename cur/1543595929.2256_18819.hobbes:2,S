That what I would like to try but It seems impossible without an
IP-enhanced firmware. I could try with the old firmware but I believe that
the new code from QLogic use some features that are only in recent
firmware.

This driver is already buggy under kernel 2.2. This driver is a well known
source of problems in the GFS mailing lists.
I believe that the better thing to do is to use the qlogic driver. If we
manage to get a recent IP-enhanced firmware we could rewrite the missing IP
code. Half of the job is already done in the source of this driver.
I didn't manage to reach the good person from qlogic. Perhaps someone would
have better results.
