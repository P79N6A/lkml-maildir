Ok Ross. Well, Gentoo's 2.6 is out now so whenever you want me to test
your new patch I can try it. Ive been looking back through the list for
the updated patches but things seemed to have changed here and there
even for the v2 patches so I think I'll wait for the next round of
patchesas things seem a little confusing.
2.6test11 is still running happily.. 6d15h now.
