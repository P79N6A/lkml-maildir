		Hello,
first of all, sorry for my English. I've found your email address in the source code of module for CX2388X based cards. I bought Leadtek WinFast DTV2000H, but it didn't work. I found, that there are two types of this card. Type I (older), and type J (latest) ... and only type I is supported by the module.
Type J is not autodetected, and if you force card type (card = 51), DVB-T works, but there is no sound in analogue television. I know why (multiplexer, which is switching between the radio, TV, and external sound is driven by GPIO pins ... and setting of this pins is wrong), and I wrote a patch, which makes this card (DTV2000H type J) works. 
With this patch, card is autodetected, I'm having sound in analogue television, I can switch between antenna, and cable signal input, and I can see video from external S-video and composite video input.
So ... do you want me to send this patch to you ? I think it will be good to add support for this card to the cx88xx module.
Bye,
