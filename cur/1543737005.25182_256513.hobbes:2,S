I profiled the 2.6.7 kernel, running a postgres load, on a 8p 4 node
NUMA machine, logging occurances of timer deletions before they expired
and timer deletions after they expired.
The results show that the ratio of timers being deleted after expiry to
timers being deleted before expiry was 10:1.
This profiling was only done for schedule_timeout since it is the most
frequent caller to del_timer_singleshot_sync.
There were 10000 occurance of timers being deleted after expiry from
schedule_timeout and 997 occurances of timers being deleted before
expiry from schedule_timout while the postgress workload ran.
The ratio was always 10:1 from the start of the workload to end as the
number of deletions climbed.
The del_timer_singleshot_sync improves performance for the case where
timers are deleted before expiry but not for the case of timers being
deleted after expiry.
The profiling data shows that the most frequesnt occurance, is that of
timers being deleted after expiry, to the ratio of 10:1. In such a case
del_timer_singleshot_sync may not provide the needed performance gain.
