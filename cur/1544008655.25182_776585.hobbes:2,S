    [WATCHDOG] iTCO_wdt : problem with rebooting on new ICH9 based motherboards
    Bugzilla #9868: On Intel motherboards with the ICH9 based I/O controllers
    (Like DP35DP and DG33FB) the iTCO timer counts but it doesn't reboot the
    system after the counter expires.
    This patch fixes this by moving the enabling & disabling of the TCO_EN bit
    in the SMI_EN register into the start and stop code.
    Signed-off-by: Wim Van Sebroeck <wim@iguana.be>
makes CPU fan spin with full speed and causes hald-addon-acpi to take 100% of
CPU time on Toshiba Portege R500 with openSUSE 11.0 user space.  This starts as
soon as hal starts or thereabouts and never ends, which makes the current
mainline unusable on that box.
Thanks,
Rafael
