Yes, that sounds fine, if there is just some sane way to indicate that 
(normally the fixup eip is close to the faulting eip, so there should be 
tons of bits available, but it would need to be something clean? For iret, 
I guess we could just set fixup-eip to zero, which would mean "return to 
eip+1 and set error", but that sounds pretty hacky too)

Page-ins etc in kernel mode are normal, and they shouldn't set the thread 
state. So I think the "turn it into a trap" thing is nicer.
