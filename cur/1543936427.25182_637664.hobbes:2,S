... the patch replaces 'test_bit(PC_WRITING, &pc->flags)' check with
'rq_data_dir(rq) == WRITE' one.  While this may look as "trivial" change it
is not such.  It should be done only after auditing the driver and making
sure that we are not introducing subtle regressions (=> I see that some
commands are setting PC_WRITING but are not setting REQ_RW bit), especially
given that these changes were not tested with the real hardware.
Please separate this change to another (post-)patch.
PS It would also be nice to remove IDEFLOPPY_DEBUG_BUGS define in a pre-patch.
