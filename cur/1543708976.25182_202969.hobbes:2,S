Why not? The only difference between `normal' and `byteswapped' disks is that
the bytes in a 16-bit word are swapped (sic :-), so you can convert in both
directions by swapping the bytes. Normal disks have been used on Atari before,
so it should (still) work.
BTW, the generic tree misses this patch, which was deemed inappropriate before,
but is needed to make sure the drive identification block is correct on those
machines:

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
