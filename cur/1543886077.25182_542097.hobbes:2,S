Thanks!  I like this one a lot.
There is one workload that is still handled a bit strange, though.  Try 
running '# ping 10.1 -A > /dev/null' x3000.  Thread creation is great until 
it hits a wall around 950, bringing system response to a screaching halt.  
Setting sched_load_smoothing from 7/8 to 1, moves the wall to around 2100, 
which is great, but where do these walls come from?
Thanks!
