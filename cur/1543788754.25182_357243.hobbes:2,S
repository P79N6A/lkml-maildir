The dprintk() macro (in mantis_common.h ) was looking very badly with 
wrap, which Andrew also commented on (about the col's) (the macro being 
the same, eventhough i was using it elsewhere) it being more than 80 
cols, but wrapping the macro made it look like hell.

My editor uses 8 columns only as a tab, Thunderbird does really handle 
things a bit different though.

i think will pass (pdev) it as a function argument. Looks a bit more cleaner
But what i fail to understand is , if you can pass it as an argument, 
why can't you save the pointer in the struct ?
