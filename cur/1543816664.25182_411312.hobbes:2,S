I have a destroyed card here.  And I tried doing that.  A rep from
sandisk told me, that yes that model/generation of sandisk could
encounter that situation where the device was simply impossible to
access because of corruption during a write.  He also said the card
would have to be sent back to the factory to have the table reset.
Newer generations were going to fix that so it didn't happen again.

Yeah, I load cards by partitioning, mkfs'ing, and extracting data.
Different manufacturers almost never have the same excact size.
