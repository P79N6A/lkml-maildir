When I wrote that I didn't realize you were referring to a different
thread about ifonfig up/down instead of my long-standing bug.
My reference to the 'disastrous effects' does refer to the problem
described in the 'ifconfig up/down' thread elsewhere in the lkml
today.  Sorry for the confusion.  That problem seems to be fixed
by this patch.  I'll keep hoping for a fix for my other tg3 bug.
