That's the main limitation on request size right now...  libata limits 
S/G table entries to 128[1], so a perfectly aligned, fully merged 
transfer will top out at 8MB.  You don't see that unless you're on a 
totally quiet machine with tons of free, contiguous pages.  So in 
practice it winds up being much smaller, the more loaded the system gets 
(and pagecache gets fragmented).
Latency definitely changes for the default case, but remember that a lot 
of that is writeback, or streaming writes.  Latency-sensitive 
applications already know how to send small or no-wait I/Os, because 
standard pagecache writeback latency is highly variable at best :)
