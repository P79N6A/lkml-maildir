Hi,
I have read back in the kernel-archives, and found this messages, about the

In this case, this modification is only for the *dirty* memory buffer.
I want to use more buffer *cache*! :-)
The unwritten dirty memory ratio is good enough for me.
Anybody has an idea?

looks like you're barely using any of your high memory.  maybe NBD doesn't
have highmem support.  what file system are you using?
NATE
I cannot understant this.
NBD need to support highmem for buffering?
If know right, the kernel does buffering, not NBD!
But the kernel only use ~830MB for buffer cache instead of dinamically use
all free memory like page cache.
This is one raw disk node, independent from file system.

Janos
