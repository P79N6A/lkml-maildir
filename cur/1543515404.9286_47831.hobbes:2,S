Thanks Doug,
Your information suggests me to investigate USB devices.

Because a USB mouse is attached and detected by the system, but no
mouse motion or button events are tracked so far,
It doesn't get any interrupts, inserting printk() into the
corresponding handler produces nothing.
I'm not at the machine site, so I'll report the result later.
