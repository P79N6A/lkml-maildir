This part interests me. It would seem that either 
1. The AS scheduler should not bother waiting at all if the process is not 
going to wake up in that time
2. The process should be woken in that time to ensure the AS scheduler is not 
wasting it's time waiting.
or a combination of 1 and 2 depending on some heuristic deciding on how 
important it is for 2 instead of 1.
No, I'm not planning on trying to implement either of these <insert usual 
complaint about time and knowledge here>, but I thought I should at least 
contribute my thoughts.
