Subject: [PATCH] pci-sysfs: backport fix for 2.6.11.12
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greg, before 2.6.12, pci_write_config in pci-sysfs.c was broken, causing
incorrect data being written to the configuration register,
which in the case of my userspace driver results in system failure.
This has been fixed in 2.6.12-rc5:

%2Fpub%2Flinux%2Fkernel%2Fv2.6%2Ftesting%2Fpatch-2.6.12-rc5.bz2;z=2656
Would you please consider merging the fix for 2.6.11.12 as well?
Alternatively (since there were multiple other changes in pci-sysfs.c), here's
a small patch to fix just this issue.
Thanks,
MST
cast from (signed) char to unsigned int in pci_write_config
causes the result to be sign extended, clobbering high bits in the result.
Thus:
# setpci -s 07:00.0 14.L=E4
# setpci -s 07:00.0 14.L
