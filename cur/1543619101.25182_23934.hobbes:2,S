I like the suggestion (most recently, of Daniel?  pardon if I
miscredit) of having patches-2.[45]@vger.kernel.org type addresses,
which would archive patches, and have a high noise-to-signal ratio.
Maybe even filter out all non-patches.
The big issue I cannot decide upon is whether standard e-mails should be
	To: torvalds@
	CC: patches-2.4@
or just
	To: patches-2.4@
(I'm guessing Linus would prefer the first, but who knows)
Also, something noone has mentioned is out-of-band patches.  Security fixes and other
patches which for various reasons go straight to Linus.
