Subject: [patch 098/104] ext4: add checksum calculation when clearing UNINIT flag in ext4_new_inode

2.6.27-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Frederic Bohe <frederic.bohe@bull.net>
(cherry picked from commit 23712a9c28b9f80a8cf70c8490358d5f562d2465)
When initializing an uninitialized block group in ext4_new_inode(),
its block group checksum must be re-calculated.  This fixes a race
when several threads try to allocate a new inode in an UNINIT'd group.
There is some question whether we need to be initializing the block
bitmap in ext4_new_inode() at all, but for now, if we are going to
init the block group, let's eliminate the race.
