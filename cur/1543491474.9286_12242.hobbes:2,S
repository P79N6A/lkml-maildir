Hello,
When compiling the kernel 2.2.5 I've got the following warning
(using ggc-2.7.2.3):
	dnsdomainname: Erreur de repérage du nom de l'hôte cible.
	sound_core.c:135: warning: `sound_loader_lock' defined but not used
	apm.c: In function `apm_get_info':
	apm.c:1187: warning: unused variable `nbat'
	apm.c: At top level:
	apm.c:607: warning: `apm_get_battery_status' defined but not used 
Is this normal ? Is my source corrupted ?
I am interested to know more about the apm errors because 
my battery status is _alwyas_  "100%" (AC on/off-line works well).
However I suspect an hardware problem: since apm works well with
2.2.x with x<4 and at some point with 2.2.4, I think, do not work
any more for the % (I reboot on a 2.2.1, same problem).
More precisely, I have remarked the problem after the installation 
of Gnome and Kde and trying the "kdeapm" and "gnomeapm".
Using this kind of soft can do damage ? (as xapm they can
interfere with my PS/2 touch pad). 
Sorry for my curious english,
Olivier
My configuration of the apm:
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
# CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK is not set
CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF=y
CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_MULTIPLE_SUSPEND=y
CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE=y
# CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS=y
