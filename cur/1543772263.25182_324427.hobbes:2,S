I, for one, fine the attachment better.  Especially as he has a signature mark 
at the end of his comments.  On my mailer (Mozilla) the attachment is inlined 
after the message and comes up in the reply window.  If it is inlined after the 
signature mark it is both half bright in the original message and does NOT come 
up in the reply.  So confusing as to how and which mailer to use...
