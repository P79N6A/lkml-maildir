	Yes, I have low_latency set for kernels lower than 2.6.17. I'm currently 
testing using 2.6.15. When you mention 'write method for flow control' do you 
mean for software XON/XOFF etc?
	On a more generic note, is the spinlock debug output read as a stack and what 
do the '=======' line breaks signify, looping?
Thanks
Andrew
