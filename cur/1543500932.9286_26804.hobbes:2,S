No it doesn't.  A popular misconception.
Individual sections retain their original license, it is stated clearly
in section 2 of the GPL.  They can be extracted under their original
licenses.
However if the non-GPL section is _modified_, the result may or may not
be under the GPL.  That would depend on the license applied to the
modifications -- often this is not dealt with clearly.
