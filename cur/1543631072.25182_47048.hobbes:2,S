        As for the second problem, which just happened: my web browser (Opera 
6.0 final, and 6.0B2) just crashed on me. Fine, no problem. But in crashing, 
should it lock up any shell running any program accessing /proc? This is 
reproducible with any kernel >= 2.5.7. After the crash, I get the following 
from ps:
bradl@bellicha:~> ps
        Hangs.
        'strace ps' shows:

        Then hangs. ctrl-c quits out of this.
        Even more so, any command accessing /proc hangs. this including w, ps, 
pstree, top, shutdown, kill, killall, and probably others I haven't tested 
yet. ps x will run, all the way up to the process which caused this, which is 
the crashed browser. But when a browser crashes, it shouldn't take out any 
other program accessing proc.
        So far, my only way around it, is a reboot. I can issue shutdown -r, 
and let it run through rc.K and rc.6. But.. it hangs in rc.K, which calls 
killall. I have to go into the box remotely (yep, even when runlevel6 has been 
called), manually remount all filesystems readonly, and issue a hard reboot 
command. it isn't pretty, but I get the system rebooted in a semi-clean way.
        The guys at Opera are saying that it's a kernel bug, since a process 
that has crashed shouldn't block accesses to /proc. But do concede that there 
could be a bug in Opera that triggers the bug in the kernel.
        Any ideas or insights into this?
                                                        BL.
