I experienced a similar problem with another National Geode board and traced the
problem back to the place where the kernel reads the BIOS memory map. I fixed it
by disabling the newer BIOS memory routines by adding '#define
STANDARD_MEMORY_BIOS_CALL' to linux/arch/i386/boot/setup.S. Alternatively try
adding it to the flags in linux/arch/boot/Makefile, since the compressed/misc.c
has similar #ifdef's.
If that fails try upgrading the BIOS or check out the ZFLinux web site
