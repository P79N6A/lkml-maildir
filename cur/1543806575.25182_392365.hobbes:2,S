ping is ICMP/IP, therefore is not relevant to the question ;)
`nmap -sT` would probably do more TCP.

It's shorter than /dev/c0t0d0s0? Well, I think it's because people think 
in terms of connectors (my drive is IDE therefore it must be hdc) rather 
than protocol (my drive does ATAPI therefore it must be 
/dev/scsi/c0t0d0s0).
