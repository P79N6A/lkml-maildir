It's a config option in 2.6 and recent 2.5 kernels if DEBUG_KERNEL
is enabled:
config LOG_BUF_SHIFT
  int "Kernel log buffer size (16 => 64KB, 17 => 128KB)" if DEBUG_KERNEL
In 2.4, edit kernel/printk.c and change the appropriate line:
#if defined(CONFIG_MULTIQUAD) || defined(CONFIG_IA64)
#define LOG_BUF_LEN     (65536)
#elif defined(CONFIG_ARCH_S390)
#define LOG_BUF_LEN     (131072)
#elif defined(CONFIG_SMP)
#define LOG_BUF_LEN     (32768)
#else
#define LOG_BUF_LEN     (16384)                 /* This must be a power of two */
#endif
