Other than the standard IA-32 differences (eg. HT, SSE3, Intel Enhanced
SpeedStep, etc.), there are few differences between the implementations
of 
IA-32e and AMD64. The software visible ones are:
Fast system calls:
  Syscall/sysret is supported only in 64-bit mode (not in compatibility 
  mode). Sysenter/Sysexit is supported in both 64-bit and compatible
mode.
CPUID:
  If you look at Table 2-8 of Volume 1, you will find IA-32e specific
things,
  including, GenuineIntel, HT, SSE3, monitor/mwait, Intel Enhanced
SpeedStep, 
  and cmpxchg16b.
  The function 8000_0001h doesn't duplicate standard-feature bits from 
  function 1 in EDX. It sets only the new features that are implemented.
MSRs:
  Not all MSRs are architectural, and IA-32e does not implement SYSCFG, 
  TOP_MEM, TOP_MEM2, for example. MSR usage should be vendor specific
and 
  be guarded with CPUID.Model
Fast-FXSAVE/FXRSTOR:
  IA-32e always saves all of the FP state on FXSAVE/FXRSTOR. Does not 
  support FXSAVE/FXRSTOR with reduced FP state.
Microcode Update:
  IA-32e supports microcode update as the 32-bit mode does, as you
already 
  found the discussions in the mailing list.
NX (No-Execute) bit:
  Initial implementation will not support the NX bit.
BSF/BSR when source is 0 & operand size is 32:
  In 64-bit mode, the processor sets ZF, and the upper 32 bits of 
  the destination are undefined. Should always check the ZF or do not
use 
  32-bit operand size.
Near branch with 66H prefix:
  As documented in PRM the behavior is implementation specific and
should 
  avoid using 66H prefix on near branches.
Not supported in IA-32e
=======================
  3DNow instructions (including prefecthw or prefetch with the opcode 0f
0d)
Thanks,
