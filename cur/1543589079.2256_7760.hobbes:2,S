Release 1.2.8: Thu Apr 26 15:18:38 EDT 2001
	* Major internal speedup; symbol evaluation is much faster now.
Symbol evaluation was the speed bottleneck in the configurator for quite a
while.  Thanks to a reorganization of one of the central data structures,
it's now down in the profiler noise.  As a result, many operations like 
commits and file loading are now so fast that I've removed their twirly-baton
progress indicators.
The new slowdown king is the algebraic-simplification code for constraints.
Greg Banks and I have been kicking around some ideas about common-subexpression
elimination that might lead to big speedups here as well, but it's a complex
change that might take a while. 
It's beginning to look like I might be able to remove the fastmode crock
after the next round of tuning.

Militias, when properly formed, are in fact the people themselves and
include all men capable of bearing arms. [...] To preserve liberty it is
essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms and be
taught alike, especially when young, how to use them.
        -- Senator Richard Henry Lee, 1788, on "militia" in the 2nd Amendment
