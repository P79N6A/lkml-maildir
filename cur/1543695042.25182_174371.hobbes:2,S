Yes, I know you can select Pentium III, Pentium 4, Athlon, etc, under 
processor type when doing a 'make xconfig', but those selections do not 
translate into the appropriate -mcpu and -march flags.
While the kernel on x86 architecture can be optimized in terms of generic 
processor specifications (i.e. i386, i486, i586, i686), the kernel can't be 
optimized beyond a i686.
If you select Pentium III, the -march flag is set to i686.
If you select Pentium 4, the -march flag is set to i686.
If you select Athlon 4, the -march flag is set to i686.
If you select Athlon XP, the -march flag is set to i686.
It should be that...
If you select Pentium III, the -march flag is set to pentium3.
If you select Pentium 4, the -march flag is set to pentium4.
If you select Athlon 4, the -march flag is set to athlon-4.
If you select Athlon XP, the -march flag is set to athlon-xp.
I don't want to have to hand edit the makefiles just to optimize my kernel.  
I think this change is simple enough to do, and would allow kernel 
developers the option of processor-specific optimizations in the future.
TIA.
