Hey, I can do this...
Just yesterday evening, when I was debugging smp_send_message()
in arch/i386/kernel/smp.c I decided to uncomment the debugging
statement.
Now once in a while the debugging statement should be printed
and handed to syslogd -- but low and behold, passing it to
syslogd can trigger the next smp_send_message(), which will
fail because the CPU is already busy sending a message...
This, in turn, will trigger an error message that keeps
the APIC so busy that even <sysrq> can't get through. Out
of the 15 crashes I made that way, only one allowed <sysrq>
and even then it only was a partial one :))
To Linus, DaveM and Ingo:  I didn't complete debugging the
SMP message passing stuff, but I guess you've already gathered
that by now :)
cheers,
