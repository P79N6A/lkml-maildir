Scratch, scratch. Well, the mutexes (fulocks) are implemented
using spinlocks; I mean, the spinlock protects the fulock
structure that describes the mutex (wait list, owner, etc),
so I am afraid we'd be chasing our tail.
What's special about the prioritized spinlocks? I don't remember
having read about that in the article.
