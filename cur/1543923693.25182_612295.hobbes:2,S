yes, it seems that was the case, but not sure if still applies. the
moment of the freezes are rather random, sometimes in the (tainted)
desktop one it takes a while too before it starts to hiccup.

most of the time, yes, it's on X applications. if I get into a tty (eg.
via Alt-Ctrl-F1) it seems to eventually recover from the intermitent
frozen state easier, but its just a matter of time to have it also dead
on the console, sooner or later. once it starts freezing the first time
  I know the whole system is, how should i say? doomed ...
never saw a bug, oops or panik message. it just drops dead, until
SysRq-B gets hit in despair :)
cheers
