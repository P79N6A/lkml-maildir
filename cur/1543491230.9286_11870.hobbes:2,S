For purposes of both learning more about the Intel architecture and
the Linux kernel, and doing something useful for my Toshiba 410CDT
laptop, I am attempting to write some simple(I hope) suspend to disk
code for Linux.  I remember seeing a similar thread discussed a while
ago, but I plan on using a different method.  I am taking the approach
of dumping an entire snapshot of memory to a partition, and then when
I get that working, a file.
Thinking this out though, I seem to have run into a logical error:
Where do I put the restore code?  There needs to be a location in
memory that doesn't need restoring, for the restore code to run from
so that it doesn't clobber itself.  First I considered video
memory(ever tried, in DOS, copying code to video memory, jumping
there, and then enabling the mouse cursor? :), but that doesn't work
if the box doesn't have a video card.
My current plan is to load the kernel, and then once the hardware has
been initialized, restore the memory image.  Is there some place in
the Intel architecture, or even in the Linux kernel, where I could
'hide' my code, or will I have to not let the kernel use all available
memory?
Thanks
