Just got bit by this little code in /etc/rc.sysinit  on RH 8.0.92:
if ! grep -iq nomodules /proc/cmdline 2>/dev/null && [ -f /proc/ksyms ]; then
    USEMODULES=y
fi
...
if [ -f /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe ]; then
   if [ -n "$USEMODULES" ]; then
       sysctl -w kernel.modprobe="/sbin/modprobe" >/dev/null 2>&1
       sysctl -w kernel.hotplug="/sbin/hotplug" >/dev/null 2>&1
   else
       # We used to set this to NULL, but that causes 'failed to exec' messages"
       sysctl -w kernel.modprobe="/bin/true" >/dev/null 2>&1
       sysctl -w kernel.hotplug="/bin/true" >/dev/null 2>&1
   fi
fi
Easy enough to work around, once you know about it. I noticed this trying to
figure out why iptables was working when the filters were built into the
kernel, but not as modules.
Hopefully this will save somebody else debugging time and/or eventually
produce a patch for rc.sysinit....
