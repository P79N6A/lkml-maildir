Hi ,
 just to give some feedback on 2.6.24-rc1. For some time I am tracking IO/writeback problems that hurt system responsiveness big-time. I tested Peters stuff together with Fenguangs additions and it looked promising. Therefore I was very happy to see Peters stuff going into 2.6.24 and waited eagerly for rc1. In short, I am impressed. This really looks good. IO throughput is great and I could not reproduce the responsiveness problems so far.
 Below are a some numbers of my brute-force I/O tests that I can use to bring responsiveness down. My platform is a HP/DL380g4, dual CPUs, HT-enabled, 8 GB Memory, SmartaArray6i controller with 4x72GB SCSI disks as RAID5 (battery protected writeback cahe enabled) and gigabit networking (tg3). User space is 64-bit RHEL4.3
 I am basically doing copies using "dd" with 1MB blocksize. Local Filesystem ist ext2 (noatime). IO-Scheduler is dealine, as it tends to give best results. NFS3 Server is a Sun/T2000/Solaris10. The tests are:
dd1 - copy 16 GB from /dev/zero to local FS
dd1-dir - same, but using O_DIRECT for output
dd2/dd2-dir - copy 2x7.6 GB in parallel from /dev/zero to local FS
dd3/dd3-dir - copy 3x5.2 GB in parallel from /dev/zero lo local FS
net1 - copy 5.2 GB from NFS3 share to local FS
mix3 - copy 3x5.2 GB from /dev/zero to local disk and two NFS3 shares
 I did the numbers for 2.6.19.2, 2.6.22.6 and 2.6.24-rc1. All units are MB/sec.
test           2.6.19.2     2.6.22.6    2.6.24.-rc1
----------------------------------------------------------------
dd1           28            50                96
dd1-dir     88                88                86
dd2          2x16.5       2x11            2x44.5
dd2-dir      2x44          2x44            2x43
dd3            3x9.8        3x8.7         3x30
dd3-dir      3x29.5      3x29.5        3x28.5
net1            30-33         50-55         37-52
mix3           17/32         25/50        96/35 (disk/combined-network)
 Some observations:
- single threaded disk speed really went up wit 2.6.24-rc1. It is now even better than O_DIRECT
- O_DIRECT took a slight hit compared to the older kernels. Not an issue for me, but maybe others care
- multi threaded non O_DIRECT scales for the first time ever !!!! Almost no loss compared to single threaded !!!!!!
- network throughput took a hit from 2.6.22.6 and is not as repeatable. Still better than 2.6.19.2 though
 What actually surprises me most is the big performance win on the single threaded non O_DIRECT dd test. I did not expect that :-) What I had hoped for was of course the scalability.
 So, this looks great and most likely I will push 2.6.24 (maybe .X) into my environment.
Happy weekend
Martin
