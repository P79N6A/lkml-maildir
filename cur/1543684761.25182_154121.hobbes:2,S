I got one of those in my office running 2.4.21-ac.  It runs well. Do you want 
to try my kernel?  Those boards are real sensitive to ESD and constantly 
loose their BIOS values if you swap a board out or pull a cable. I had one 
that refused to boot on me today and I just pulled and reseated the PCI cards 
and it came back to life.
