Could we try to focus on the issue here, please. Larry was suggesting
an FTP test, not a multi purpose do whatever you feel like in a LAN
setup.
The multi NIC issue is a totally different issue, it needs to be dealt
with (if it has not been done yet) but it is a different issue.
Talking about multi NIC setups, I was experiencing some really strange
things with 2.2.10 yesterday when I was hacking on the AceNIC Gigabit
driver. It seems to me that 2.2.10 at least sometimes has problems
deciding what interface to use for traffic.  I have two PCs each with
two NICs in them, a GigE and a 100BaseT (with the GigE's being on
192.168.8.x and the 100BaseT's on 192.168.9.x), all connected through
the same switch. Now if I run traffic through the Gig cards over
192.168.8.x and shut down the GigE driver because I want to update it,
I sometime have problems talk to the other end at 192.168.9.x,
basically nothing seems to get through (guess it is time for tcpdump
at both ends).
I was wondering if Linux sometimes decides to send out all traffic on
one interface because it detects everybody's on the same switch or
whether it is something else fishy going on.
