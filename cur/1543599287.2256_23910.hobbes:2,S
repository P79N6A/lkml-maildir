I managed to catch one of these crash the system messages:
Aug 28 14:07:51 hoppa kernel: hda: timeout waiting for DMA
Aug 28 14:07:51 hoppa kernel: hda: ide_dma_timeout: Lets do it again!stat = 0xd0, dma_stat = 0x20
Aug 28 14:07:51 hoppa kernel: hda: DMA disabled
Aug 28 14:07:51 hoppa kernel: hda: irq timeout: status=0x80 { Busy }
Aug 28 14:07:51 hoppa kernel: hda: DMA disabled
Aug 28 14:07:51 hoppa kernel: hda: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=c018f67c, new=c018f67c
Aug 28 14:07:51 hoppa kernel: bug: kernel timer added twice at c018f526.
Aug 28 14:07:53 hoppa kernel: ide0: reset: success
Note the second the last line: "bug: kernel timer added twice at
c018f526"
This occured 4 mintues after a system reboot and some rsync activity. 
It occured this time when I was in the shell doing a cd [tab].
Other times the HDD might have just crashed again.
Note: this box is also acting as a router between three interfaces at
the same time with IPSec on one of these interfaces.   
Is this likely to make the situation worse?
