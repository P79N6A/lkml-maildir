Ahhh. Spec'd by standard means that each -S unit is worth 5 seconds (for 
values up to 240 = 20 minutes), and the second part means that there is 
a minimum (which is not specified in this report, unfortunately). 
Perhaps you can get a hold of the full drive manual, the exact minimum 
value is probably specified there.

Just to be sure: you did use -S 60 to get 5 minutes, right?

Yes, that seems correct. Nothing too weird there: it simply seems that 
the drive doesn't support the power management knob. (AFAIK you should 
be able to confirm this using the feature sets listed in the output of 
hdparm -I.)
> Perhaps -S is failing too, just without the diagnostic?
Perhaps, but I'd expect it to print a diagnostic if it fails. I do seem 
to remember that (at least for some drives that I've seen) there isn't a 
diagnostic if you go below the device specific minimum, the value is 
simply ignored.
Cheers,
