man amixer
(the native ALSA-Mixer)

       set or sset <SCONTROL> <PARAMETER> ...
              Sets the simple mixer control contents. The parameter can be the volume either as a percentage from 0% to 100% or an exact hardware  value.
              The  parameters cap, nocap, mute, unmute, toggle are used to change capture (recording) and muting for the group specified.  The parameters
              front, rear, center, woofer are used to specify channels to be changed. When plus(+) or minus(-) letter is appended after volume value, the
              volume is incremented or decremented from the current value, respectively.
              A simple mixer control must be specified. Only one device can be controlled at a time.

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as 
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
