The core circuits of Trident 4D come from an China IP company 
call T^2 (T square) which is basically the same as our SiS 7018
so I am working on imporving the driver.
I have no idea how the quality of Trident 4D is, but our SiS 7018
audio core embedded in SiS 540/630 works great with the most updated
develpoment driver. I have some bug reported from users of DX boards
which can not be reproduced on my chip ;-).
Trident 4D and SiS 7018 are AC97 controllers which send DIGITAL bit
streams to AC97 codecs for further D/A conversion. If there is any
background noise heard, you should blame your AC97 codec not the
controller.
