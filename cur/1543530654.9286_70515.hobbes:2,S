So you have 1 process hogging all the memory and all the others in a rather
peacefull state. You go OOM and SIGNMEM that process, which obviously ignore
it. Now you have a system that a) OOM b) with not chance in hell of
recovering memory, except in the case where a good program frees some
memory, which wakes up the hog for more hogging.
Congrats. You now have a program with no runnable processes.
