  The attached text is an extract from an error report about several
subscribers, as those people ISPs/corporations run rather simple-minded
message content filters.
  No doubt you have received your share of triple alphabet denoted
messages about "services" some purvouers want to draw your attention
into.  Unfortunately (for the Adaptec driver config symbol name)
the  AIC7NNN (lets use "wrong" character here to avoid scanners)
is considered by weak quality scanners to be the very same as "NNN",
which usually is a signature feature in such messages.
To understand this, you need to consider how you would detect when the
"NNN" is stand-alone, and when it is just part of some other string.
See  "man perlre"  for "\w" and "\W" patterns.
Similar kind of content scanner pattern mistakes creep up weekly,
if not daily.  Sometimes forbidden words lie inside other longer
words, sometimes I can't figure out why systems complain about some
messages.
Some people have asked us (me and DaveM) of why we don't run fully
automatic list management (instead of ancient Majordomo 1.x), e.g.
a bounce leads into immediate unsubscription.  Think about that..
