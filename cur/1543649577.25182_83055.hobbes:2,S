Ordinary DUAL Pentium 400 MHz machine does this...
Calculating CPU speed...done
Testing checksum speed...done
Testing RAM copy...done
Testing I/O port speed...done
                     CPU Clock = 400  MHz
                checksum speed = 685  Mb/s
                      RAM copy = 1549 Mb/s
                I/O port speed = 654  kb/s
This is 685 megaBYTES per second.
                checksum speed = 685  Mb/s
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
