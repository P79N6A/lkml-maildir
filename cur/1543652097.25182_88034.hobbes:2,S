Michael,
thanks for the results, they look really good!
There's a problem with your script for Schedbench: the column labels
are permuted! Instead of
>                              Elapsed   TotalUser    TotalSys     AvgUser
you should have
>                              AvgUser   Elapsed      TotalUser    TotalSys
The numbers make more sense like that ;-)
Could you please send me your script for schedbench?
BTW: the bk repository has now two distinct changesets, one for the
"core" the other one for the initial balancing. Larry McVoy showed me
how to do things right with the names assigned to the changesets.
Thanks!
Regards,
Erich
