I believe this interruption is for the sound module. The /proc/interrupts I 
sent you for the 2.6 kernel had been taken with a system that had been 
running X11 (with nice sounds ;-) for a while, where the /proc/interrupts I 
sent you for the 2.4 kernel had been taken just after having booted in 
runlevel 3 for a short while, without having produced any sound. This might 
explain this difference.

I'm not sure that the 2.4 series kernel logged the IRQ fixups the same way 2.6 
does... I'm no kernel specialist.
But I remember that long ago (with early 2.4 kernels) I had had interrupts 
problems with the VIA chipset, until some specific VIA fixes were integrated 
into the 2.4 kernel, and since this day everything was OK -- until I tried 
2.6 kernels...

Yes, and I'm really afraid of breaking my storage, as the EVMS snapshots I use 
to perform backups seems to be severely broke with the 2.6 kernel and my 
system -- which means I don't have recent and reliable backups until this 
gets fixed, but this is another issue.

Please tell me how you would like me to boot ;-)
Another little issue is that, with kernel 2.4, the activation of EVMS and RAID 
sets from my initrd produces very verbose output, so verbose that the very 
beginning of the dmesg messages gets lost before true loggin is started and 
they have a chance to get copied to /var/log/messages... It has never been an 
issue to me as 2.4 is running fine... But if you want my 2.4 kernel to 
produce yet more verbose output, it might be difficult ;-)
I don't have this problem in 2.6 as the EVMS/RAID startup is far less verbose.
Cheers.
