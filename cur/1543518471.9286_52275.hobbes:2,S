But only if A is correctly aligned.  If A starts at address n*8+7 then
at least one arch (i370) can generate 0x1122 for the above code.  Most
variables are correctly aligned but if you are doing something nasty
like mapping shorts or ints over unaligned storage like this
char buf[16];   /* Assume starts at address n*8 */
CPU 0                            CPU 1
*((__u16 *)(buf+7)) = 0x1111;    *((__u16 *)(buf+7)) = 0x2222;
then the results are undefined.
