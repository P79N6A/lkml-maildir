yeah - it does the trick: i just booted the .config in question and your 
patch works fine and the bootup does not hang in slgt_init() anymore:
 Calling initcall 0xc1e78d86: slgt_init+0x0/0x1ee()
 SyncLink GT $Revision: 4.36 $
 SyncLink GT no devices found
 initcall 0xc1e78d86: slgt_init+0x0/0x1ee() returned -19
 Calling initcall 0xc1e78f74: n_hdlc_init+0x0/0x9c()
 HDLC line discipline: version $Revision: 4.8 $, maxframe=4096
 N_HDLC line discipline registered.
 initcall 0xc1e78f74: n_hdlc_init+0x0/0x9c() returned 0
thanks! Find below the full patch with metadata filled in (no other 
changes).

From: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>
built-in drivers suffered bootup hangs with certain driver unregistry
sequences, due to sysfs breakage.
do the minimal fix for v2.6.21: only wait if the driver is a module.
