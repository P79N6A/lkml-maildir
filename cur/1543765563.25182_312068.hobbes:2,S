Hello,
Does anyone happen to know how the upcoming multi-core CPU will be handled
by the kernel?  Does it see each core as a physical or logical CPU or ?
Vanderpool is a hardware support for OS virtualization (running multiple OS
"at the same time"), how does Linux kernel make use of this, particularly
which part of the kernel code? 
I poke around the source (2.6.10) some but haven't figured both issues out
yet.
Many thanks!
Linda
