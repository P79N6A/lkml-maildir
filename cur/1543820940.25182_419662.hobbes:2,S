Subject: [PATCH 0/9] CPU controller
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Andrew,
This patchset adds a CPU resource controller on top of Resource Groups. 
The CPU resource controller manages CPU resources by scaling timeslice
allocated for each task without changing the algorithm of the O(1)
scheduler.
Please consider these for inclusion in -mm tree.
