    Hi
   I've installed a Red Hat 6.0 machine and recompile the kernel (2.2.5   
supplied, by Red Hat on the CDROM) increasing file_max and NR_OPEN (as    
described in the proc.txt under Documentation). Now whenever I try to
start portmapper service it dies immidietly withe error:
Sep  1 19:47:20 gamedev portmap[8179]: run_svc returned unexpectedly
Any of the hackers (in the right sense of the word) can help me solve
this? 
	Paolo
