Please stop breaking things in /proc. The pmap command relys
on the old behavior. It's time to revert. Put back the segment ID
where it belongs, and leave the key where it belongs too.
Containers are NOT worth breaking our ABIs left and right.
We don't need to leap off that bridge just because Solaris did,
unless you can explain why complexity and bloat are desirable.
We already have SE Linux, chroot, KVM, and several more!
