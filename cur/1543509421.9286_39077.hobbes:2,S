In case of swapping over network [I'm talking about nbd, not about
nfs!], it will be interrupt handler of network card which will try to
kmalloc(..., GFP_ATOMIC) and fail. Therefore, kswapd will be blocked
because it is waiting for ACK, because ACK was dropped because
kmalloc(..., GFP_ATOMIC) failed. I really don't think PF_MEMALLOC flag
will help deliver memory to network card's interrupt handler.
