Should have checked myself before posting my previous reply -- but
this doesn't seem to work.  /proc/NNN/root is represented as a
symlink, but when you CLONE_NS and then try to look at another one of
your process' /proc/NNN/root the link doesn't seem to have a target
and you get permission denied on all accesses.  I haven't looked at
the underlying procfs code, but adapting procfs for this sort of
purpose feels wrong.
