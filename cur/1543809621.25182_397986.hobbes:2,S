On i386 and x86_64, the edd module reports the 2 types of C/H/S values
as BIOS knows them, in /sys/firmware/edd/int13_dev*/
legacy_max_cylinder, legacy_max_head, and legacy_max_sectors_per_track
are int13 AH=08h values.
default_cylinders, default_heads, and default_sectors_per_track are
int13 AH=48h values.
Files not in that directory mean the value reported by BIOS was zero.
