Ok, I will make open a bug in a moment.

A have tested 7 differents vanilla kernel on the same suspect hardware:
                2.6.8  : ntpd working : drift from    -77ppm to   -144ppm
                2.6.9  : ntpd working : drift from    -99ppm to   -231ppm
                2.6.10 : ntpd failed  : drift from -37825ppm to -29912ppm
                2.6.12 : ntpd failed  : drift from -43429ppm to -45251ppm
CONFIG_HZ=100  2.6.14 : ntpd failed  : drift from  -7598ppm to  -4410ppm
CONFIG_HZ=250  2.6.14 : ntpd failed  : drift from -13519ppm to -12538ppm
CONFIG_HZ=1000 2.6.14 : ntpd failed  : drift from -14497ppm to -19543ppm
So it seems that the problem start from the kernel 2.6.10. While testing 
I feel that the 2.6.14 kernel behave a little different than the others 
kernels. The drift don't increase alway in the same direction as for the 
others kernels, but oscillate around a central (too high) value. I also 
tested differents values of CONFIG_HZ with the 2.6.14 like suggested by 
Roman Zippel, but this don't make the ntpd working. Interresting, with 
CONFIG_HZ=100 the drift is halfed and ntpd reset his stats after each 5 
pools! Something I didn't notice with any others kernels.

I have 2 others machines with kernel >=2.6.10: one with kernel 2.6.12 
and one with kernel 2.6.13 and theres don't have any problem with ntpd. 
So this seems to be specific to the hardware. The two machines without 
problem are based on VIA chipset, one with a K7 and one with a K8. The 
machine with the ntp problem is based on a nForce2 with a K7. I see an 
other post saying that there exists the same problem with a other 
nForce2 based board.
Hope this help,
