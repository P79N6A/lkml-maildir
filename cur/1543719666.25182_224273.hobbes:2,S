hm it looks like all this would gain is that instead of 2 or 3 function calls
you need to do one which then calls those 3. The *driver* already knows if
it needs busmaster or not etc, so when I wrote this code I felt that the
driver could do a better job really. But well if you think it's worth it to
save those 3 lines into 1 ?

I made the PCI layer save PCI config space always, and the generic resume callback
conditional, so saving PCI config state is not something that explicitly
needs to be done in the suspend hook. I don't know what else a suspend
standard function needs to do.
