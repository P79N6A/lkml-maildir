Dan, I'd be willing to join in with some of the hacking.  I helped
develop STP so am familiar with how it works and how to apply it to
this.  I've used/compiled/cursed at gcc for years but am not super
familiar with its internals, so would welcome some advice and help
there.
Would anyone else be interested in joining in on doing this?  I think
providing this testing service for gcc would be invaluable for the
community.  Basically we need a couple folks with perl scripting and
html form creation skills.
Anyway, if I get a few positive responses and it's okay by Tim, I'll go
ahead and get a mailing list, etc. set up for everyone interested in
joining in on this.
