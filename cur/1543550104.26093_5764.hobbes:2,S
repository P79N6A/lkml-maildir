Hi,
   As far as I know, and Alan can correct me if I'm wrong, 2.2.x doesn't
support e820h bios call, only the e801h call.  The problem is that a lot of
these newer bioses dropped the e801h from the bios, and only have 88h and
e820h.  As a result, 2.2.x will report 64Mb, since the only call that works
is 88h.  2.4.0test on the other hand supports e820h, which is why 2.4.0test
gets the memory size correct.
