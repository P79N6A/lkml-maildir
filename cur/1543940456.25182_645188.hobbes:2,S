That's correct.  The only other change to cciss.c in my tree is where
the BUG() call was replaced with a call to blk_dump_rq_flags():
	@@ -1257,7 +1257,8 @@ static void cciss_softirq_done(struct request *rq)
	 #endif                         /* CCISS_DEBUG */
		if (blk_end_request(rq, (rq->errors == 0) ? 0 : -EIO, blk_rq_bytes(rq)))
	-               BUG();
	+               blk_dump_rq_flags(rq, "cciss rq");
	+//             BUG();
		spin_lock_irqsave(&h->lock, flags);
		cmd_free(h, cmd, 1);
