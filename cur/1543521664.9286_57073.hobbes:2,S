I think so - look at /usr/src/linux/vmlinux. I think this is the uncompressed
boot image. Also - when building the kernel there is a line that gives the
sizes (using the size command). I'm using 2.0.33 on a print server ant I get
the following:
bash$ cd /usr/src/linux
bash$ size vmlinux
text    data    bss     dec     hex     filename
592030  64732   109293  766055  bb067   vmlinux
bash$ ls -l vmlinux
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root       763072 Mar  6  1998 vmlinux
and the compressed image (in the root directory) is:
bash$ ls -l /vmlinuz
-rw-r--r--   1 root     root       318878 Mar  6  1998 /vmlinuz
