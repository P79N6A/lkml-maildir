I looked through __vmalloc implementation and the call tree. Nowhere
do I see a problem with calling __vmalloc in atomic context (with
GFP_ATOMIC flags, of course). Except for a few architectures (arm,
m68k, sparc and xtensa), flusch_cache_all is a nop. I didn't look into
all architectures, but at least for m68k, flush_cache_all seems to
safe in atomic context. Please correct me if I am wrong.
To reiterate, __get_vm_area_node allocates space for 'struct
vm_struct' with GFP_KERNEL irrespective of how its caller was called -
if __vmalloc was called with GFP_ATOMIC, the node for that allocation
should be allocated with the same flags. So the patch I suggested
simply passes the flags from __vmalloc down to __get_vm_area_node.
If indeed it is not safe to call __vmalloc in atomic context (even
with GFP_ATOMIC flags), perhaps we can add BUG_ON(in_atomic()) to
__vmalloc?
Thanks,
Giri
