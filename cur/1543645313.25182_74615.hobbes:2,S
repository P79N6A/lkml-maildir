   -	if (hwdev == NULL || ((u32)hwdev->dma_mask != 0xffffffff))
   +	if (hwdev == NULL || (u32)hwdev->dma_mask <= 0x00ffffff)
    		gfp |= GFP_DMA;
So alan, why is this really broken?
EISA/ISA DMA is defined as using a hwdev of NULL or requiring
<16MB address, he is preserving GFP_DMA in those cases.
The only problem I have with the patch is that it probably isn't
that hard to let the page allocator take some MASK arg (defaults
to all 1's) to implement this in 2.5.x
