Stable != backwards compatible to the year dot.  ppp-2.4.0 has been
out for over 5 months now.  Adding the compatibility stuff back in
would make the PPP subsystem much more complicated and less robust.
And pppd is not the only thing you would have to upgrade if you are
using a 2.4.0 with Red Hat 7.0 - I would expect that you would also at
least have to upgrade modutils, and switch over from ipchains to
iptables if you use the netfilter stuff.
