LILO assumes that names in /proc/partitions correspond one-to-one with
names in /dev. This assumption isn't true under LVM (and need not be
true in any circumstances: you can rearrange disks in any way you
like with udev, and a number of distributions do).
> Should I do anything to avoid the message?
As far as I know, it's harmless.
