And one of those corner cases in fact came around and bit us on the ass.
If we had handled the transition the smooth way I wanted to, and was
prepared to, we'd still have a maintainable help database spanning 2.4
as well as 2.5.  As it is, Linus blew my system into flinders and 
obsoleted all my tools (I'm not talking CML2 itself now but the machinery I
wrote for tracking help changes).
As a result, I had to tell Marcelo I had no choice but to drop maintaining
the 2.4 help file.  The divergence, and the damage, is probably not
recoverable.
