Did not see this warning, it applies cleanly 8-)

It looks like it, it compiles in one go! (did not run it (yet))
I was only wondering about this:
# make KBUILD_VERBOSE= KBUILD_MODULES=1 bzImage
<snip>
  CP     drivers/char/defkeymap.c
<snip>
  LD     drivers/char/built-in.o
rm defkeymap.c
^^^^^^^^^
<snip>
why is it first copied to this dir and later on, after linking all char 
drivers together, it is removed again... isn't it simpler to just leave the 
file in place??
I also like the complete silence of the final linking:
  BUILD  arch/i386/boot/bzImage
Root device is (3, 2)
Boot sector 512 bytes.
Setup is 2636 bytes.
System is 847 kB
This is very nice!
I have a minor 'fix' included
