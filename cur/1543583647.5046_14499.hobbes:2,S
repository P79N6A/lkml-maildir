2 possibilities: you misconfigured kernel or didn't
make  an initial ramdisk to load scsi modules.
to make a good configuration, you may wish to use the config
files that redhat used to build the kernel you say works,
and then just tweak a few things like processor type.
they're installed (i think) in /usr/src/linux/configs
if you install kernel-source package.
try command 'man mkinitrd' under redhat
for hints about initial ramdisk.
