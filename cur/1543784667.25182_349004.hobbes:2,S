Subject: [patch 5/7] uml: fix fault handler on write
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/9/10/116

The UML fault handler was recently changed to enforce PROT_NONE protections,
by requiring VM_READ or VM_EXEC on VMA's.
However, by mistake, things were changed such that VM_READ is always checked,
also on write faults; so a VMA mapped with only PROT_WRITE is not readable
(unless it's prefaulted with MAP_POPULATE or with a write), which is different
from i386.
Discovered while testing remap_file_pages protection support.
