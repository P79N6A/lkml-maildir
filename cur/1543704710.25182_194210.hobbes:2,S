btime in /proc/stat does not stay constant but decreases at a rate of 15
secs/day. (So I thought that that's why there is that four minute error in
ps output after uptime of a couple of weeks.) Maybe this has something to do
with the fact that the 'timer' line in /proc/interrupts does not seem to
increase at an exact rate of 1000 steps per second but about 1000.18 steps
per second, instead. (The relative error is the same: 0.18 divided by 1000
is equal to 15 seconds divided by 24 hours).
I made an experiment shown below. I know nothing about kernel programming,
so this is probably not correct, but at least btime seemed to stay constant.
(I don't believe this fixes procps, though. If HZ if off by 180 ppm then I
guess ps can't possibly get its calculations involving HZ right. But at
least the bootup time reported by procinfo stays constant.)
