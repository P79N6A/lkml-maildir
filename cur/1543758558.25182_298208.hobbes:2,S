This is still showing the same 'cs: unable to map card memory!' issue on my
Dell laptop.  Backing out bk-pci.patch makes it work again.
For what it's worth, the hotplug system wasn't able to initialize the wireless
card (TrueMobile 1150) at boot - still needed cardmgr to get it started up.
But that might just me being an idiot...
