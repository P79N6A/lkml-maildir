No, only in strace.

If regs->rax is unsigned long, then I would think the compiler would
be allowed to convert
   switch (regs->rax) {
	case -514 : whatever;
   }
to a no-op, as regs->rax will never have a negative value.
However it appears that the current compiler doesn't make that
optimisation so I guess I was too hasty.
Still, I think it would be safer to have the cast, in case the compiler
decided to be clever.... or does the C standard ensure against that?
Sorry for the noise,
