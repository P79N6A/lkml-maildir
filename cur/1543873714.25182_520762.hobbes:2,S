what do you think about the idea i suggested: to do an x32_/x64_ prefix 
(or _32/_64 postfix), in a brute-force way, _right away_. I.e. do not 
have any overlap of having both arch/i386/ and arch/x86_64/ and 
arch/x86/ - move everything to arch/x86/ right now.
in the initial step we dont even have to attempt to share anything - we 
just want to make sure everything still works fine. Just create a 
'unified' layout with the prefix/postfix solution, and make sure that 
the build architecture can compile existing .configs just fine, which 
results in a functionally identical vmlinux that would be built if these 
files were still in arch/i386/ (and arch/x86_64/).
i dont think we want to have a too long 'overlap' period. Lets just 
unify them, that would be the only large-scale intrusive move.
From that point on, the unification decisions would be largely per-file: 
"do we want to unify process_32.c and process_64.c into the same file?".
