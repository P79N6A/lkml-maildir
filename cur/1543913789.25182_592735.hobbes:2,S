After inspecting arch/*, I cannot agree with you.
Otherwise almost all major architectures use
"conceptually buggy busy-waiting":
arch/alpha
arch/i386
arch/ia64
arch/m32r
arch/mips
arch/parisc
arch/powerpc
arch/sh
arch/sparc64
arch/um
arch/x86_64
All of the above contain busy-waiting on atomic_read.
Including these loops without barriers:
arch/mips/kernel/smtc.c
			while (atomic_read(&idle_hook_initialized) < 1000)
				;
arch/mips/sgi-ip27/ip27-nmi.c
	while (atomic_read(&nmied_cpus) != num_online_cpus());
[Well maybe num_online_cpus() is a barrier, I didn't check]
arch/sh/kernel/smp.c
	if (wait)
		while (atomic_read(&smp_fn_call.finished) != (nr_cpus - 1));
Bugs?
