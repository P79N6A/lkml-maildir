Just a few comments on the CONFIG_X86_TSC changes:

I'm fine w/ the X86_TSC change, but I'd drop the X86_PIT for now. 
Then make the arch/i386/timers/Makefile change to be something like:
obj-y := timer.o timer_tsc.o timer_pit.o
obj-$(CONFIG_X86_TSC)		-= timer_pit.o #does this(-=) work?
obj-$(CONFIG_X86_CYCYLONE)	+= timer_cyclone.o
Then when you boot, boot w/ notsc and you should be fine. 
I do want to add some sort of TSC blacklisting so one doesn't always
have to boot w/ notsc if your machine is
detectable/compiled-exclusively= for. But I've got a few other issues in
the queue first. 
thanks
