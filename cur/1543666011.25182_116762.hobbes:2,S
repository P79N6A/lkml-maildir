Larry, this brings up something I was meaning to ask you before this
thread exploded.  What happens to those "logical change" numbers over
time?
My understanding (since you mentioned ~ 3 minute latency on BK pushes,
not five hour latency) was that future changes would go into CVS
incrementally.  As far as I understand the "revision numbers" that BK
uses, they're subject to change.  Based on what trees Linus merges
from, a revision number in his repository may not always have the same
number.  So the comments will become out-of-date and inaccurate.
Or am I wrong about the potential for change within a single
repository?
