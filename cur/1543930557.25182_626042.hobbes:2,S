I just happen to have a Windows Vista installation on this box as
well, and I just thought to check. Sorry, I wish I'd have thought of
it sooner but I don't go there often. You folks might be interested
to know that Windows appears to have the same silly problem with the
i/o resources (from Device Manager):
[000000290 - 000000294]  Motherboard resources
[000000290 - 00000029F]  Motherboard resources
I don't have anything that reads sensors in Windows though, so I
couldn't tell you if it could access that it87 chip or not.
So this pretty much confirms that it's a motherboard/bios issue.
