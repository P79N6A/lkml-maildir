Yes, it was introduced so that drivers could view the state in 
an interrupt context. (how this flag is set is platform dependent.)
struct pci_dev {
         pci_channel_state error_state;
 };
enum pci_channel_state {
   /* I/O channel is in normal state */
   pci_channel_io_normal,
   /* I/O to channel is blocked */
   pci_channel_io_frozen,
   /* PCI card is dead */
   pci_channel_io_perm_failure,
};
Unless I get distracted, I'll provide an e1000 patch shortly ?
