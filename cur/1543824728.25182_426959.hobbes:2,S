Hi all,
I have a Dell Inspiron 5150 laptop with a Broadcom BCM4401 network card which 
uses the b44 driver.
With recent kernels (I've tested with Ubuntu's 2.6.15,  vanilla 2.6.16.18 and 
2.6.17-rc5) the driver loads without error but the interface isn't 
registered.
In dmesg:
b44.c:v1.00 (Apr 7, 2006)
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:02:01.0[A] -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 177
eth0: Broadcom 4400 10/100BaseT Ethernet 00:11:43:7b:69:ae
# ifconfig eth0
eth0: error fetching interface information: Device not found
With Ubuntu's 2.6.12 kernel everything works as expected. I've not tried any 
kernels between 2.6.12 and 2.6.15, but can do so if it'd be helpful.
Anybody else having problems?
Thanks in advance,
David.
