I agree 100% with your diagnostic. Its directly as if your /var/spool volume
hung and the mylex stopped responding on that channel. I take it there is
nothing in dmesg ?
Another thing to try is
touch /foo &
hit return
(should report it finished)
touch /var/spool/foo &
(if this never returns you know you /var/spool choked for some reason)
