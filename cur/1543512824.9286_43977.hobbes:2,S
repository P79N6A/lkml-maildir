It seems more difficult to code an iBCS-like module which will run
64-bit Monterey apps on a 32-bit Linux kernel, rather than vice versa.
Though perhaps, as one person mentioned, the article is merely talking
about a common 64-bit ABI which will run transparently across IA64 and
other Monterey-compatible OS's.
