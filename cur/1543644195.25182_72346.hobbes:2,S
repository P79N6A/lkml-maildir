This patch get a number of rejects against 2.4.20-BK-current :(
Also, posting the patch's real URL would be useful :)  I can't stand 
SourceForge's multiple levels of indirection, just to get to a file. 
For other's, here's the 2.4.20-pre7 patch, without indirection:
http://unc.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/acpi/acpi-20020918-2.4.20-pre7.diff.gz
Is there a BK repo I can pull from to get these changes?
