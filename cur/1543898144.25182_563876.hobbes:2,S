Sorry for coming in that late, but using syscalls for something as
periphal sounds like a very bad idea to me, and the syscalls aren't
defined nicely either (e.g. you have an ioctl lookalike).  I'd say
back to the drawingboard.
And yes, even ioctls are nicer than badly designed syscalls :)
Also code seems to be odd at least in a few places, e.g. all the access_oks
and double checks of the ioctl-lookalike commands should go.
