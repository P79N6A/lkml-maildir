   Sometimes it is needed to let one PCI device do DMA to another part
   of itself or another PCI device.  For this, you need the bus
   addresses of the PCI memory resources.  If
   pci_resource_start(dev,x) doesn't give you that, where else could
   it be found?  By doing configure space reads I guess, but is that
   really necessary?
I just remembered that there is a problem with this, not all PCI
implementations can DMA across different bus segments.  For example,
if the two busses are behind different PCI controllers on sparc64,
you cannot do peer-to-peer DMA between them.
So besides putting the resource->pci_bus_address translation interface
into asm/pci.h, we'd need to provide an interface which a driver can
use to ask "pci_peer_to_peer_possible(pci_dev1, pci_dev2)".
