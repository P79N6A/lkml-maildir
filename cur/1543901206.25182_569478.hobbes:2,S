There could be another thing, of course. The kernel sources (or .config)
needn't be the only variable here -- if you're using the "old" kernel image
for the 2.6.20 kernel that works, it could be the case that perhaps you've
upgraded userspace packages (compiler/toolchain) in the meanwhile
that's causing this breakage ... so to test, try compiling the 2.6.20 on
your system again (with same .config) and see if it works now ...
