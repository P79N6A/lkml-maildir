Subject: [PATCH 2.6.21.3] ppp_mppe: account for osize too small errors in mppe_decompress()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/5/93

Prevent mppe_decompress() from generating "osize too small" errors when checking
for output buffer size. When receiving a packet of mru size the output buffer
for decrypted data is 1 byte too small since mppe_decompress() tries to account
for possible PFC, however later in code it is assumed no PFC.
Adjusting the check prevented there errors from occurring.
