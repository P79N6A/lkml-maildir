I had the same problem;  the DUL people said there had been people spamming
from my ISP, so they blocked _every_ user from that ISP (which is quite big)
I found very annoying that it just took a Joe Spammer to rip me from my
right to run sendmail on my PC.  Funny, huh?
So I switched ISPs and hope it takes a while to happen again.  :|
