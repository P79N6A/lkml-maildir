What are the files called and what command do you use?
I can only see 3 filenames it complains about ...
Is "Ne03:" a valid filename on ntfs/vfat? I guess it must be since it
creates the files. Or is that output garbage?

The following change should make the directory cache work with NT (and
also make it almost disappear).
dir.c:smb_readdir
-       if (!cachep->valid ||
-           (cachep->mtime != dentry->d_inode->i_mtime &&
-            filp->f_pos == 2))
+       if (!cachep->valid || filp->f_pos == 2)
I don't have a patch for 2.2.16, if you are not afraid of testing
pre-versions I have this patch vs 2.2.17-pre11 (pre12&pre13 should be ok
with this too).

Let me know if this fixes your problem.
