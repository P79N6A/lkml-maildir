Yes that's right.  [Note that I erroneously wrote thread_struct when I
meant task_struct].
On closer inspection I see it is the *parent* task_struct that is the
problem here.  The task has indeed exited and the memory for the
task_struct is correctly held.  However, the /proc code will grab
tasklist_lock and dereference the parent task_struct to get the parent
pid.  Grabbing tasklist_lock is good, of course, when the task is live
because the parent could be switched at any time.  But in this case the
child is already done.  And so is the parent.  So the child's parent
task_struct is gone, but the stale held task_struct still points to
where it once was.
Does this sound like a possible scenerio?
