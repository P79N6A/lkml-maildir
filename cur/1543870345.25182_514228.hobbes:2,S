Dan has a point here. Now I clearly can't comment on how bad 8 is
needed, but since this has been like this for a while, I'll have to
assume 4 is covering most cases.
Moving things to a different range _will_ be much worse for distro
maintainers than driver developers. And I bet the latter is going to be
minor work as things has been like this for a while.
But we can still allocate 4 more at a different minor that distro's can
_choose_ to use. Consider it an enhancement to the 4 we have had in the
past.
