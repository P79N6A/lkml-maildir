  Something strange is going on here: after I cleaned up the bisect kernels,
  I booted 2.6.23-rc7 using something like:
  "vga=normal nohz=on root=/dev/sda7 libata.noacpi=0 pci=assing-busses"
  and explicitly selecting "Enable Video Mode Handling Helpers" (which normally
  gets automatically selected once I choose "ATI Radeon display support" but I
  - suffering from intense paranoia - selected it by hand prior to selecting ATI
  Radeon ...).
  I works! X is no longer acting weird. I can't use "vga=791" anymore (the screen
  goes blank until X loads => timings definitely changed) but it *works* and I don't
  know why _and_ I can't seem to be able to make it go back to being bad :)
  I did a diff between the .config used in bisect and the current .config. I don't
  see anything suspicious.
  I'll to do a full cleanup and start all over. I'm going to nail this thing down if
  it's the last thing I do! (so help me God) :)
