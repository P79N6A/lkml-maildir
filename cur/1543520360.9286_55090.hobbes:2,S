For the mathematics and theoretical computer science enthusiasts here on this
list:
I have taken a look at the source code of the Linux Kernel floating point
emulation engine for i386 (as of 2.2.12, don't know if it changed in 2.3.x). I
noticed that it uses Taylor/Maclaurin polynomials to approximate the sine,
cosine, tangent, and inverse tangent functions. Wouldn't CORDIC be a better
algorithm for computing trigonometric and exponential functions instead? CORDIC
is a method for calculating mathematical functions using only addition,
shifting, and looking up entries in a table. More details can be found at
