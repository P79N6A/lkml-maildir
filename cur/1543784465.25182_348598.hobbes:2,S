I have such a device myself (send me an email in private if you want to 
confirm it is the same model et al). The HID driver worked just fine. I 
also found that there was almost zero information about this on the net. 
I just use USB, USB HID, USB HID input support, Input support, and the 
Input joystick interface driver. Works just fine, check it with the 
joystick calibrator program of your choice. If your PSX -> USB converter 
doesn't support the joystick HID (which most seem to do) you may need a 
driver of some kind. Or better yet go buy one that does support it, you 
should be able to pick one up for less than $20 USD.
