When /proc was introduced, the "boringly stable probed way" involved opening 
/dev/kmem and grotting around pulling out binary structures from arbitrary 
addresses in kernel-space, which structures had an annoying tendency to 
change with every change to the kernel.  It was anything *but* stable.
sysctl came much later.
