Hi !
I compiled some different kernel and tried - no success without module, 
module=fujitsu, module=laptop, model=asus. I went through the alsa doc and 
found the section about Conexant 5047. I tried it and got some sound when 
using module=laptop-hp.
So I suppose some pins are different here.
So let's summarize: I get sound on a 2.6.23 with module=laptop-hp. Laptop is a 
fujitsu-siemens v5505 as mentioned.
Best regards
Jan-Simon
