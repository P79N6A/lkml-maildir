Sorry, was a little busy.
I tested the patches and they work. Couple of comments:
- register_lock_class is marked as inline but now has 2 call sites and
is relatively big - might want to remove "inline"
- how about adding lockdep_set_subclass() to avoid littering source
with struct lock_class_key when we only want to tweak subclass? For
that we might want export register_lock_class and hide it behind a
#define...
