Maybe the card just overheated? Do those LEDs normally ever go dim?
These cards draw a considerate amount of power, so it is conceivable
that either the card, or the CardBus power switch decided to take a
vacation elsewhere... Looking at the log, it seems that the card just
disappeared - which would be consistent with hardware failure, and power
failure in particular.
