The gcc optimized code for sure much better than I do, but gcc's
optimization captabilities is for sure a joke compared to the guy how wrote
2fish_86.asm (just have a look at the source). The assembler implementation
is twice as fast as the C implemention we have in the kernel. Same is true
for AES (although just 50% faster instead of 100%:

 . That's gas
btw. )

The Twofish code is C but has hooks to use an asm backend in special cases
(keysetup, en/decrypt). But a plain C version of twofish is already present
in the kernel.

That's certainly nice to hear. At least some cut/pasting can be done :)
