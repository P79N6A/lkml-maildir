Oh my.  This isn't clear to the part-time kernel hacker; to install
[...]linux/include/linux in /usr/include/linux implies that those headers
can and should be used in user-space.  I've already done this several
times, in order to use kernel structures from user space.  Whoops :-)
Perhaps the header files that are intended to be used only within the
kernel tree could be moved to a seperate directory, and then not installed
in /usr/include.  Obviously 2.5 material, if Linus is so inclined.
I would rather a build break when what's defined in a kernel header file
gets changed (such as a critical structure, or the like) and further
maintenance of the user-space utilities is needed; a "heads-up" to the
maintainer if nothing else.  The recent episode with klogd is a fine
example of how well that would work.  If klogd had its own copies of
headers and built fine, we all would quite possibly still not know about
the inconsistency.
