Hi Jon, this approach seems mistaken to me.  If I understand it right, 
your mental model is that the driver has a list of file names for firmware
files, and calls user-space with the right file-name for the device in
question.  Given that model, having drivers tell the world about their
firmware file list is reasonable; but I think the model is a bad one.
Much better would be to have drivers work at a higher level of abstraction,
and have user-space map the driver's abstract firmware request to a
particular firmware file.  The kernel should say: I am the x driver,
I want firmware for the y device, my version is v, the device version
is r, etc etc.  Userspace should work out that the appropriate file
is ql2322_fw.bin and upload it.  This is similar to the way the kernel
handles other requests for services, such as loading modules (the kernel
can ask for a particular module, but it can also ask for a module which
provides a certain functionality).  Of course this requires making udev
firmware handling more intelligent.
I gave the example of the speedtouch driver to show how complicated
things can be.  I didn't mean to suggest that the scheme it uses is
a good one - it is a bad one, in that the real solution is to make
userspace smarter.  In any case, I don't see how your suggested patch
could reasonably work with the speedtouch driver - after all, the
driver doesn't have a list of possible firmware files, and can't
have one because no-one knows exactly which files exist or may be
needed; and even if I had a decent list, I think it would be a mistake
to hardwire it into the kernel.
Ciao,
D.
