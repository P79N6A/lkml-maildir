Same problem for me, but unfortunately, I don't know how to fix this. I've
seen that KM_IRQ* are not defined on x86. I don't know if I can use other
ones, not what would be the consequences. Would you please enlighten me a
bit on this, I'm willing to test it but don't know how to build it first.
Thanks in advance,
Willy
