I agree -- completely, on all counts, and I'm trying to take that up
with Osamu Tomita, but he hasn't replied to my emails.
BTW, I have fixes for about 95% of all of the PC-9800 modules
and can successfully build a PC-9800 kernel, with IDE, SCSI,
speaker, etc.  However, I can't test it.  So I think that it is
fixable, but if it's been abandoned, it can also be removed.
