Subject: ES1869 audio plays too fast

On my laptop (a Compaq Presario 1260), which has integrated ES1869 audio, 
any sounds that are not played via KDE's artsd daemon are played at many 
times their correct speeds.  Sounds played through artsd are OK.
Examples of non-artsd applications would be RealAudio and mplayer.  In 
these applications (at least) human voices sound like chipmonks.  Music 
sounds like, well, very fast music.
This is on a RedHat v7.2 system with all RH-released updates applied, and 
with kernel v2.4.17.  Below is what I hope is pertinent info.
Can anyone advise me on how to fix this problem?  Thanks.

This is the audio-related output that I get at boot time:

My audio-related kernel config looks like this:
CONFIG_SOUND=m
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS=m
CONFIG_SOUND_TRACEINIT=y
CONFIG_SOUND_DMAP=y
CONFIG_SOUND_SB=m
CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812=m
And then we have the modules loaded:
# lsmod

This is the relevant portion of my /etc/modules.conf:
