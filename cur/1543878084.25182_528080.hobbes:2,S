My two cents.
cpu hotplug up/down semantics with respect to irqs do not appear to be
implementable in a race free way on x86, with the current generation
of hardware.
The suspend/resume semantics for disabling irqs seem perfect
reasonable. (We tell the drivers to shut off the irqs before we even
consider migrating or turning them off).
We already have suspend/resume callbacks for everything else, why
not some of the core subsystems.
Because of the global disable nature of suspend/resume I suspect it is
actually easier to implement a suspend/resume callback.
If we are only talking core subsystems here there is much less of
problem for duplicating functions then if this was at the driver level
because core subsystems everyone uses, so there are more eyse on the
code.
cpu hotplug is still CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL suspend/resume is not.
