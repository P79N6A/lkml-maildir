found a bug that causes !PREEMPT boot failures. The seqlock type was
wrong for the !RT case, resulting in a subtle bug:
write_seqlock_irqsave() didnt actually disable interrupts. This results
in a deadlock scenario in where the timer interrupt interrupts
update_times (which runs in softirq context). I've uploaded the -31-1
patch with this fix included to the usual place:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
i'm cycling through the various options, but it's looking good so far,
PREEMPT_NONE, PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY and PREEMPT_DESKTOP all booted up fine.
