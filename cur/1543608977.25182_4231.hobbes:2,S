None of these patches make any significant difference
to throughput of anything, really.
If you have a particular latency-sensitive application then
that's the thing which you should be testing with.
There's a modified version of Mark Hahn's `realfeel' app in 
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/amlat.tar.gz
which I find to be a convenient way of quantitatively
determining latencies.  There are some grubby scripts
in there which create graphical output too.

J Sloan was the first to send me an updated patch this time.
Thanks!
It needs a bit of maintenance at present - last time I gave it
a good beating (a couple of weeks ago) there were a couple of
ten millisecond blips.
