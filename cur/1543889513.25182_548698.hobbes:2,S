I just tried this on an Altix from the test lab, and ia32 bash just
started.
native 64 bit gave this:
$ ls `find / -xdev -type f` | wc
      1   89847 4200288
but the 32 bit bash kept complaining about his arg list being too long.
This might be a 32->64 issue (/bin/ls is 64 bit after all - and I
couldn't find a 32 bit ls in the compat packages), but I really don't
know. Will look into this.
The difference I had with what I posted last is below; these changes
were just me cleaning up. (and fixing one bug on STACK_GROWS_UP
introduced by the previous patches - but AFAIK that is not relevant to
ia64)
