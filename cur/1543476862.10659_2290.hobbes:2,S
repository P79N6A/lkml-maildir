Subject: autofs stuck at down() in mkdir/rmdir

This is on a Sparc 4m/690 running vger 2.2.0-pre4 and autofs 0.3.14. We
are using autofs to handle /home with many NFS mounts. After some use,
automount locks up as such:
# ps axl | grep automount
40     0   328     1   0   0   1388   220 pipe_read   S   ?   2:13 automount
40     0 21506   328   0   0   1392   284 rmdir       D   ?   0:00 automount
140    0 21512   328   0   0   1388   492 mkdir       D   ?   0:00 automount
Are there any known problems with the semaphore locking code in 
sys_mkdir/sys_rmdir?
Thanks,
Anton
