nope. Stupid question, i just tried it and got this:
 EXT3-fs: Unrecognized mount option "relatime" or missing value
i've got util-linux-2.13-0.46.fc6 and 2.6.22 on that box, shouldnt that 
be recent enough? As far as i can see it from the kernel-side code, this 
works on the general VFS level and hence should be supported by ext3 
already.
even relatime means one extra write IO after a file has been created, 
but at least for read-mostly files it avoids the continuous atime 
update.
