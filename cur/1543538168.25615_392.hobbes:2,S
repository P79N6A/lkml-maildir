I have a Digital UNIX box on my desk and admin several Digital UNIX
boxes in my job.  It is not too horrible, but I would not hold it up as
a shining example of a system that can do realtime work.  It wasn't
until recently that I didn't have to wait through multi-second freezeups
on my box whenever I did large amounts of file I/O.  I'm not sure they
really fixed the problem as much as painted it over in more recent
Digital UNIX versions.
I don't think any sane person would want to maintain whatever
self-modifying code tricks that Digital UNIX might use to accomplish
this fabled feat.  And did I mention that the Digital UNIX kernel is a
massive 8 megabytes _after_ you prune out most of the optional features?
