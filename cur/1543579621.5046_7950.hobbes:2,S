I absolutely and totally agree.  I strongly recommend this to
anyone at all.  If someone MUST share between NT and Linux,
install NT on partition 1 first, and make sure to grab ATAPI.SYS
update from MS first if you value any data on the drive and it
is >8Gb.  ;o)

All my new machines are getting straight Linux installs, no dual
boot anything except perhaps multiple boots of different versions
of Red Hat.  Only one machine shall have Windows on it, and only
until the remaining uses of it are available in Linux.  I
suspect it wont be too long.  ;o)
