IMO yes. If vfs_permission() works for a piece of code it's the obvious 
preference. If on the other hand you really need to check permissions on a 
file, then why not use this function?

I didn't use initializers because they initialize the entire data structure. 
In case of struct vfs_lookup, unless the LOOKUP_OPEN flag is set, then the 
open_intent doesn't need initialization. We could use a DEFINE_... macro; not 
sure this would improve anything though.
