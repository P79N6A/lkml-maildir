Subject: [PATCH] pre-2.3.9-1 compilation problems
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On x86 SMP:
drivers/block/block.a(ll_rw_blk.o): In function `make_request':
ll_rw_blk.o(.text+0x933): undefined reference to `lock_kernel'
ll_rw_blk.o(.text+0x93e): undefined reference to `unlock_kernel'
ll_rw_blk.c should #include <linux/smp_lock.h> on SMP systems. The patch
I've attached does that.
Also, PIIX support currently fails to compile (ide_dmaproc undefined).
Haven't had the time to fix this, but PIIX works with just the Generic IDE
support enabled.
