For a desktop or server machine, yes.

Agreed, for standard desktops and servers.

There is no reason why the boot data can't go to a secondary display,
or a serial terminal, or a printer, or a speaker as a bleep code, etc.

There are applications where it is not appropriate to have it, though,
what if you were using Linux in an embedded device such as a set top
box?
It's perfectly possible that somebody might want to make a television
set top box out of a standard x86 motherboard and VGA card, and not
have anything displayed until X starts, because the television would
not accept the standard VGA scanrate, but X can easily re-program that
to around 15 Khz.
In this case, boot data could be sent to a serial port, and the
graphics card initialised by the boot loader to display a "Please
wait, set top box booting up" screen, using a scan rate, which would
be acceptable to the television.  In this case, we do not want the
kernel to change the video card setup at all.
