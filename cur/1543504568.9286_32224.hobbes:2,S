Why an expression, and not a statement? (Yes, I know this is C,
but...). Besides, the first version will return "true" always (either expr
is zero, in which case you get what printk() returns, or expr is true). The
second one will return "false" always. So the instrumented code will do
different things according to KERNEL_ASSERT...
Better take a look at the way assertions are handled in glibc (assert(3))

Do wrap this kind of stuff into "do { ... } while(0)"! If not, it _will_
screw up if's.

A bit too cute code, IMHO.

... but result in massive bloat, and hang the system when an failed
assertion is hit (printk() can't be called everywhere!)

AFAIU, Linus doesn't want this kind of stuff in the kernel, for good
reason: It is bloat when enabled, and useless when disabled.

Ditto.
