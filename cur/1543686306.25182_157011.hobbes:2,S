OK.. that's what I *thought* the code was doing.. ;)

Can be reset with remount: rdonly, sync, mandlock, atime, diratime.
Can't be reset: nosuid, nodev, noexec, dirsync, and a few others.  Of those,
nosuid and noexec seem pointless for a root file system (though they may make
sense if you have a *really* minimal / and separate /bin /sbin /etc filesystems
- I seem to remember one minimalist config trying to get a r/o / so /etc was a
separate mount...), so at least for my current application, nodev is the only
thing I can't get with remounting....
If there's a consensus that a 'rootopts=' would be a Good Thing, I'll write a
patch.  If not, I'll just fix the initial value of root_mountflags in init/do_mount.c ;)
