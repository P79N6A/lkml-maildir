Yes.  
Except when under tight time constraints this is clearly possible.
When under time constraints things are more dicy. I expect that
with a tuned kernel you can be back in user space in about 1 second.
Detecting a failure is hard and slow.  Unless the condition that
triggers the panic is the initial source of the panic it is quite
likely a time window less than 1 second has already elapsed.
So I am certainly willing to discuss this but until I see a clear
model where a new kernel will not meet the time constraints for
some fairly fundamental reasons, and that a crash notifier
will almost always meet those same time constraints, I can't imagine
a persuasive case.
The panic notifier itself is barely used and it seems to exist
only because we didn't have a general purpose policy mechanism.
