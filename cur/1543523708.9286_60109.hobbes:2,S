There is a 2gb file size limit, depedning on
the way your database is designed, this could be a factor.
(ie Mysql saves tables as files, so in effect each table has
a 2gig limit, but not the entire database)

Hi!
I need to setup a machine with 256MB RAM (maybe 512MB) for a database
server. I will have a database with size more than 2GB. Can I do it with
kernel 2.2.x? What is the limit? Do you recommand another type of hardware
(Alpha etc.)?
Thanks!
