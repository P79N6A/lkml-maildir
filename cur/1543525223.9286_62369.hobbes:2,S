(IIRC) none of my recent fixes cure oopses thus if something oopses you
probably have a race in the lowlatency patch (I would guess you are
sleeping a place were you can't sleep). Or maybe the patches trigger a
real bug where some copy_user is called in a racy place or similar
stuff. I have not checked it yet.
You are welcome to try out 2.2.14aa7, only be careful to _not_ compare
2.2.14 with 2.2.14aa7+lowlatency patch because I just have performance
stuff in 2.2.14aa7.
Comparing 2.2.14aa7 and 2.2.14aa7+lowlatency is certainly ok instead.
