Hi,
What I mean is that:
There are some bridge devices to be supported by a driver for various
device types and vendors. In the long run PCI drivers will have power
dependency one another in the long run. It is natual that PCI bridge driver
reports its child devices and their dependency to PCI core because PCI core
driver needs to know power up/down sequence at suspend/resume time. So I
think callbacks from bridge-to-core is useful. Especially it is more useful
for the core to get exact timing to power up the next driver if some
devices have certain latency to power up.
