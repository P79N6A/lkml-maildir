The scheduler can be optimized for that, so far at the cost of
pessimizing
the common case with few threads.  The bigger problem here is that
your cpu (particularly TLB's and caches) aren't optimized for switching
between a lot of threads either.  This will always be a problem as long
as cpu's have level 1 caches much smaller than the combined working
set of your threads.  So run one thread per cpu, perhaps two if you
expect
io stalls.  The task at hand may easily be divided into many more parts,
but serializing those extra parts will be better for performance.
