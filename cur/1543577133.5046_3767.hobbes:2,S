It seems to change the problem, but fixes it in most ways.  I can
give you a dmesg output if you want one.  That fixed the "confused
drive" errors and lets me boot, but now hdc and hdd are timing out
because of the reasons that they timed out in 2.2.
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 14
is what I get now.  I haven't tried this yet, but I'm assuming a simple
re-addition of 'ide1=0x170,0x376,15' to the kernel options should put
ide1 back on irq 15 where it belongs (I haven't rebooted yet because I
was just so excited that this works.  Geez your smart, Linus!)

I've attached the output I got from doing cat /proc/pci from
2.4.0-prerelease.  Because of a subtle configuration difference between
the two, there is a few I/O differences and output differences (because
of the jump in kernel versions) from 2.2.18pre21 (I really should
upgrade to 2.2.18).
Thanks,
