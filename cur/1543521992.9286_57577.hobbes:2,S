   Ok, moving the check inside the tcp_send_delayed_ack it's fine for me.
   But there's to say that the only other way the delack timer could be
   posted is via __tcp_ack_snd_check. And if __tcp_ack_snd_check is using
   tcp_send_delayed_ack instead of tcp_send_ack before in order packets with
   data are arrived (so before the ato is been initalized to something
   different than zero) it probably means there's a genuine bug in tcp.
True; but my paranoia says that even if there isn't a problem *now*,
there may be later.  Which is why why I'll suggest one more change to
your patch:
	if (!timeout) {
		timeout = tp->rto;
		if (!timeout) 
			panic("Bugcheck: tcp_send_delayed_ack ato and rto are 0");
	}
It adds one conditional inside a rare 'if' case, so it's not a
performance issue, and it means that the next time something like this
happens, the machine will cleanly panic, and leave a very easy to
understand indication of what went wrong.
