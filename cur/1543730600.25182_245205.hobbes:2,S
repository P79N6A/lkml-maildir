Actually this is only FUD spread by Joerg. He is definitely not the only man on
this planet knowing how to program CD/DVD burning equipment.
Generally cdrecord has one big deficiency, which obviously was intended:
it does not allow medium skilled programmers from drive _vendors_ to add
support for their latest hardware easily. Everyone has to beg Joerg, which
obviously increased his ego dramatically over the years.
It would be a lot better to start off a new project where vendors (or anybody
with skill and will) can contribute more easily, i.e. something that is truely
_open_.
