Very true.

To download firmware into the CPU is conceptually redefining the CPU, so
this should happen (and intel says so!) _before_ the OS starts. In any
case, the whole CPU detection and bug workaround habilitation should be
done afterwards in all cases. That is why I advocate doing this f.ex. from
lilo, not from the OS.
