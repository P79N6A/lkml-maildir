Subject: [PATCH] General race condition with init thread may prematurely free start_kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

(Please CC replies to me, I'm not subscribed to lkml.)
I think I've found a bug, local to linux/init/main.c, related to
freeing init pages, which seems to be present in 2.4.5.
Executive summary: After start_kernel has created the init
thread, it needs to proceed to cpu_idle before init pages are
free:d, since it's __init-marked.  But if the init thread is
scheduled to run before the parent thread, and in turn its call
to do_basic_setup returns quickly, start_kernel will be
free_initmem:d before that thread has proceeded to cpu_idle.
Boom.  Patch at end.
Somewhat lengthier description and analysis: I found this out
the hard way when fixing free_initmem (and the linker script) in
Linux/CRIS.  In linux/init/main.c it looks as follows at a
conceptual level:
void __init start_kernel()
{
  foo_init();
  blah_init();
  ...
  kernel_thread (init, NULL, CLONE_FS | CLONE_FILES | CLONE_SIGNAL);
  current->need_resched = 1;
  cpu_idle();
}
Correspondingly, the function init looks as follows:
static int init(void * unused)
{
	do_basic_setup();
	free_initmem();
        ... start up /bin/init or whatever ...
}
And do_basic_setup looks like this:
static void __init do_basic_setup(void)
{
    baz_init ();
    ... more *_init() calls ...
    ... mount root fs ...
}
If nothing in do_basic_setup causes rescheduling, it might
(depending on e.g. timing) return before the parent has
proceeded to call cpu_idle, from which it never returns.  If so,
free_initmem will be called, freeing among others start_kernel.
Later, when the parent thread is scheduled to run and returns
from the kernel_thread call, it will execute in unmapped memory.
Bad: will crash, perhaps depending on that memory being recycled
and modified.
Normally, mounting the root fs involves mechanical disks or
network activity or other stuff that causes I/O or takes time.
Then rescheduling will cause the parent thread to resume to
safety before do_basic_setup returns.  You're most likely to see
the race problem on platforms with a solid-state root fs.
Analysis sanity-checked with bjornw@axis.com.  Repeatable on an
"Axis Developer Board LX" (with patches to fix the linker script
and remove the #if 0:s from linux/arch/cris/mm/init.c; contact
me if you actually need to do this).
One solution is to break out the last piece of start_kernel to a
non-__init function as follows.  The patch is against 2.4.5.
