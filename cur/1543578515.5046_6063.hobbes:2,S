Thanks for the report.
But with so tiny information, it gives about no usefulness to me.

A single ruined CD is probably too weak a symptom for stating any serious
sickness in the driver. FYI, I cannot even personnaly try to ruin a single
CDR, for the reason I don't have CDR.
If you can retrieve information related to the failure, you may send me
them (syslog messages, cdrecord output messages, etc...). Thanks in
advance. You may also give a try with stable kernel and related stuff and 
let me know the result.
Regards,
  Gérard.
