Subject: 2.2.17pre9 VM still broken

2.2.17pre9 has died on me again. Now I don't get "do_try_to_free_pages
failed" messages every time INN's expire runs, but only about every
other day, and it isn't _always_ fatal, but the VM seems still unstable.
Don't discard the mmap test as non-practical load, there are
applications out there which seem to have similar access patterns.
