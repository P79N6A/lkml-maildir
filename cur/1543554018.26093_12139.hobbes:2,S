It's probably a program called 'sa' that anacron starts up right after boot
(on RH 7.0). It's a system accounting program that starts up and scans the
entire drive looking for stuff, which fills up cache in RAM.
I generally disable all anacron stuff and remove /etc/cron.??* and the
daily/weekly/monthly entries in /etc/crontab, then I run 
'/etc/rc.d/init.d/crond restart'. That oughta fix it, but you might want to
look into the cron scripts individually and selectively remove the lines you
don't want. :-)
