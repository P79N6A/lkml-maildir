http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl-faq.html#WritingFSWithNFLibs
 offers some
    insight on linking free software with non-free libraries.
    However, I'm not sure I agree with your interpretation of the relationship
    between kernel and driver.
    The kernel is fully functional (excluding use of the hardware for which
    the driver provides an interface) without the driver code - however, the
    driver requires the kernel to be usable. Still using your analogy, it would
    seem the driver is the application, and the kernel is the library.
    The facilities that the driver provides to the kernel don't seem to be
    much more than callbacks used in traditional library schemes to implement
    application specific behavior as part of a larger library framework.
    My 2c.
