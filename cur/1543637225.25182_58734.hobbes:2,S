agreed, this is much nicer.
i removed the spin_unlock_no_resched() define, and modified the slab.c fix
(and the other spin_unlock_no_resched() places) to be more verbose about
what they do.
we still have preempt_enable_no_resched() - that is legitimately needed in
a number of cases - i've added comments to make its usage clear.
these cleanups are in the -G5 patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/remove-irqlock-patches/remove-irqlock-2.5.27-G5
i've test-booted BK-curr + G5, CONFIG_SMP, CONFIG_PREEMPT and
CONFIG_DEBUG_IRQ_SCHEDULE kernel on an SMP box, it works fine.

Changes in -G3:
 - slab.c needs to spin_unlock_no_resched(), instead of spin_unlock(). (It
   also has to check for preemption in the right spot.) This should fix
   the memory corruption.
 - irq_exit() needs to run softirqs if interrupts not active - in the 
   previous patch it ran them when preempt_count() was 0, which is
   incorrect.
 - spinlock macros are updated to enable preemption after enabling 
   interrupts. Besides avoiding false positive warnings, this also 
 - fork.c has to call scheduler_tick() with preemption disabled - 
   otherwise scheduler_tick()'s spin_unlock can preempt!
 - irqs_disabled() macro introduced.
 - [ all other local_irq_enable() or sti instances conditional on
     CONFIG_DEBUG_IRQ_SCHEDULE are to fix false positive warnings. ]
Changes in -G0:
 - fix buggy in_softirq(). Fortunately the bug made the test broader,
   which didnt result in algorithmical breakage, just suboptimal
   performance.
 - move do_softirq() processing into irq_exit() => this also fixes the
   softirq processing bugs present in apic.c IRQ handlers that did not
   test for softirqs after irq_exit().
 - simplify local_bh_enable().
Changes in -F9:
 - replace all instances of:
	local_save_flags(flags);
	local_irq_disable();
   with the shorter form of:
	local_irq_save(flags);
  about 30 files are affected by this change.
Changes in -F8:
 - preempt/hardirq/softirq count separation, cleanups.
 - skbuff.c fix.
 - use irq_count() in scheduler_tick()
Changes in -F3:
 - the entry.S cleanups/speedups by Oleg Nesterov.
 - a rather critical synchronize_irq() bugfix: if a driver frees an 
   interrupt that is still being probed then synchronize_irq() locks up.
   This bug has caused a spurious boot-lockup on one of my testsystems,
   ifconfig would lock up trying to close eth0.
 - remove duplicate definitions from asm-i386/system.h, this fixes 
   compiler warnings.
