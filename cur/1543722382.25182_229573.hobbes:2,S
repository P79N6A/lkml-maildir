My patch posted on 22 Jun had a bug!
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=108791355225806&w=2
In the __run_timers, I missed spin_unlock_irq before fn(data). Your
patch correct rightly. Thanks!

No. There is one thing I need correct. I need replace proc interface
with sysfs, as Christoph and Arjan commented.
After fix this, I'll release stable version 1.0.
Best Regards,
Takao Indoh
