That would indeed be a wild guess, I guess I've done somewhere inbetween 
50 and 200 so far, and I guess there's probably somewhere around 1-2000 
left... but, I'm guessing.

I don't think it matters much really. The way I read the numbers they seem 
to indicate that the performance impact is very small in any case, and I'm 
not even entirely sure my way of trying to measure is accurate, so I don't 
know how much should be read into those numbers...
