It's not a problem, see below.  The 2.5 code is better, since only one
body of code is managing the TD queues for async (control, bulk) and
interrupt queue heads.

Slightly different in 2.5.48 since it uses a dummy TD (so certain race
conditions can't happen), and it won't line-wrap that qh_update() call.

That code runs under a spinlock_irqsave(&ehci->lock,...), so no
other task can preempt.  And list_splice() doesn't modify qtd_list,
so the qtd_list->next pointer stays valid ... it's like list_del(),
not list_del_init(), read <linux/list.h> to see.
