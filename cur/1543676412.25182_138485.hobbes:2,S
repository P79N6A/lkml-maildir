Hi Linus!
This one is pure magic, really.  No comment and inspection of the code
doesn't show much either.  But judging from the other changes, this
should also fix a real problem, at least a theoretical one.
The only code that could be bitten by this change is ppp, so I changed
that as well.  Paulus, could you have a quick look at it?
Jörn
