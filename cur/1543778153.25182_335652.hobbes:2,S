Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.13rc3: RLIMIT_RTPRIO broken
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

RLIMIT_RTPRIO is supposed to grant non privileged users the right to use
SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR scheduling policies with priorites bounded by the
RLIMIT_RTPRIO value via sched_setscheduler(). This is usually used by
audio users.
Unfortunately this is broken in 2.6.13rc3 as you can see in the excerpt
from sched_setscheduler below:
        /*
         * Allow unprivileged RT tasks to decrease priority:
         */
        if (!capable(CAP_SYS_NICE)) {
                /* can't change policy */
                if (policy != p->policy)
                        return -EPERM;
After the above unconditional test which causes sched_setscheduler to
fail with no regard to the RLIMIT_RTPRIO value the following check is made:
               /* can't increase priority */
                if (policy != SCHED_NORMAL &&
                    param->sched_priority > p->rt_priority &&
                    param->sched_priority >
                                p->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_RTPRIO].rlim_cur)
                        return -EPERM;
Thus I do believe that the RLIMIT_RTPRIO value must be taken into
account for the policy check, especially as the RLIMIT_RTPRIO limit is
of no use without this change.
The attached patch fixes this problem. I would appreciate it if the fix
would make it into 2.6.13.
