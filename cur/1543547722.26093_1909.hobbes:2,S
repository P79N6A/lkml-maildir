Ok, hopefully this will make sense...
__block_commit_write calls balance_dirty, which might wait on bdflush, 
running all the io on the page.  The async_end_io handlers will unlock the 
page once io on all the buffer heads is done.
So, by the time generic_file_write (or the new truncate code) calls 
UnlockPage, the page could have been unlocked by i/o, and relocked by 
another process.
Or am I missing something?
