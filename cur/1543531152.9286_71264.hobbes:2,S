Which user. The current structures do not allow the determination of the
process responsible for going out of its limits, since there are no limits.

True.

The penalty is to the user going over the alloted limits. Not to the system.
Not to the other users of the system. and they don't add that much overhead.
We are still only talking about decrementing a quota counter.

No, but they can be estimated.

Sure, we would. People will always expand to use whatever resources they
feel they can get.

Yes and no. In any given time period yes. Over a longer term view from a
user, no. IF N were 10,000 definitely. And it doesn't matter what time period.
We are actually below the level that a statistic average really applies for.
This is the area the "period processing" takes place. That area of operations
that allows for very large process capability by reducing the total number
of users. And prevents interference with that policy.

I've optimized to protect the common case against the worst-case. WE are
NOT talking about single user workstations.
