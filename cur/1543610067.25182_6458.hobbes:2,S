Umm...  In principle doable, but then we are losing anything resembling
sane behaviour on seek to remembered position.  OTOH, it's weak anyway
and saying that it's FIFO and trying to squeeze something from lseek()
is not too attractive.
I'll do that variant - it will be local to file/seq_file.c.  I'll give it
some beating and send it - hopefully in an hour or two.
