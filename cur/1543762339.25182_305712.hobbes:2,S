We put it in /proc primarily because what we wanted was 
similar in many ways to /proc/iomem and so we (re)use a bit 
of the code. Also, we were wondering if it is appropriate to 
put in multiple values in a single file in sysfs.

Looks like. And the tweaks could be handled by the user 
space kexec-tools.

This does not have the sysfs related code. Is there a 
separate patch for adding the sysfs entries?

This value is per memoryXXXX directory, right?
