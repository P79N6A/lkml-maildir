As a pro-devfs person I felt the same and hate to say it but "read the
archives".  Someone gave a good writeup on the problems with devfs and
how udev will (eventually) solve them.
I just hope udev can give a look/feel similar to devfs as I have quite a
few machines already in production configured for devfs and really like
the manageablility.
