Yes.. well given every iteration on that kind of primitive touches _all_
architectures supported by Linux, I think it's good to think a bit about
the design in advance to minimize the amout of wasted effort. Especially
because it requires some coordination between many architecture
maintainers.

I had this patch applying over Christoph Lameter's vm tree last
February. It did accelerate the slub fastpath allocator by using
cmpxchg_local rather than disabling interrupts. cmpxchg_local is not
using the local_t type, but behaves similarly to local_cmpxchg.

Look for LWSYNC_ON_SMP and ISYNC_ON_SMP in 
arch/powerpc/include/asm/atomic.h
They map to the lwsync and isync instruction, which are more or less
memory ops and instruction execution order barriers. They become both
unneeded when modifying per-cpu data from a single CPU.

The penality is only space and wasted cache-lines whenever the data fits
in smaller data types, but I think we can start with a single data type
(long) and add more if needed. I agree with you on renaming, it's bad.
People trying to forward port their code will have a hard time managing
the type behavior change, especially if the compiler does not complain.
local_counter_t and local_atomic_t seems good to me, except the fact
that atomic_t maps to "int" and local_atomic_t would map to "long",
which might be unexpected. If possible, I'd try to follow the current
semantics of "atomic_t" for int and "atomic_long_t" for long, because I
think those types should offer a similar interface. I know that
local_counter_long_t and local_atomic_long_t are painful to write, but
that would follow the current atomic_t vs atomic_long_t semantics. Hm ?
