Can you fix that?  If so, try that.  Would be the best.

I think you can't.  What is "anywhere else"?  Does that include
userspace addresses?

Not sure how portable that is, but comparing the vaddr against
the vmalloc address space could work.  There are macros for
that, VMALLOC_START & VMALLOC_END IIRC.
