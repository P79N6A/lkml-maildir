The stuff about EINVAL was in P1003.1a (Circa 1995):
5.5.2.4 Remove a Directry -- Errors (POSIX.1 Line 538) Add new errors
and descriptions following [EEXIST] or [ENOTEMPTY]
   [EINVAL]    The _path_ argument contains a last component that is dot
or dot-dot.
I don't know if this was ever formally adopted. Last I knew, it was
still just a draft (I have the D12 version)...
