It's your choice :-) You HAVE rights to do it. If you made THAT choice I want
to add you in my blacklist. I can avoid touble though: ORBS already done that
for me :-)

They not even asking :-) You are blocked them. It's enough.

Then I (and every other ORBS user including l-k; especially l-k: here ORBS
was added not just since "it's good thing to do" but after some thinking on
subject as Matti Aarnio showed) blacklist you :-) Seems fair to me.

Perhaps. Blocking will not change that though.

You understood that it's not possible, right ? The only way to make someone
pay here (in Russia) is come to him with big gun - it's almost impossible to
do via court even in FAR more obvious situations. And Russia is not the only
such place in the world.
In ideal world ORBS is not needed and perhaps even amoral. Unfortunatelly we
do not live in ideal world :-(
