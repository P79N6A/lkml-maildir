You can only unmount a file system if there are no references to the vfsmount
object anymore. Since shrink_dcache*() is called after checking the refcount of
vfsmount while unmounting the file system, it isn't possible to hold a
reference to a dentry (and therefore call dput()) after this point in
time. Therefore your reference counting on the vfsmount is wrong which is the
root case for your problem of busy inodes.
