I can confirm that there is a problem in test10. I have a Treo600 and
plugging it in (and/or pressing the hotsync button) results in no
autoloading of the visor module. If I manually modprobe the visor
module, then when I connect/disconnect and/or press hotsync there is no
activity viewable via "dmesg".
Greg, how can I troubleshoot this better for you?
