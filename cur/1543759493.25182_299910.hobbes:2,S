I'd rather not just apply this patch - there's rather a lot there to
just apply on top of what's already merged.
Is there any chance you can split it up into a smaller set of changes

We'll also need to run this by Linus first, explaining why you believe
it's now ok to merge this.  (Added Linus...)
