This seems the case.  SuS v3 says:
setrlimit
RLIMIT_NOFILE
    This is a number one greater than the maximum value that the system
    may assign to a newly-created descriptor. If this limit is exceeded,
    functions that allocate a file descriptor shall fail with errno set
    to [EMFILE]. This limit constrains the number of file descriptors
    that a process may allocate.
open
[EMFILE]
    {OPEN_MAX} file descriptors are currently open in the calling process.
 
limits.h
{OPEN_MAX}
    Maximum number of files that one process can have open at any one time.
    Minimum Acceptable Value: {_POSIX_OPEN_MAX}
So, one view says your test program is within the spec, since the new fd
is still one less than the current rlimit.
Anyway, here's a simple patch that would fail the second setrlimit, as you
suggested.
thanks,
