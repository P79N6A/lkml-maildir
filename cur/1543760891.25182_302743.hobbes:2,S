I've been running kernels with:
+       if (old->child) {
+               printk("Resource %p still has children: %s\n", old, old->name);
+               return -EINVAL;
+       }
+
here and it hasn't triggered once.  I suspect the reason it hasn't is
because no one does release a resource with children, but I suspect
that's just by mere luck than design.
The only thing I'd question is whether we really need to BUG_ON() here.
ISTR Linus' policy for BUG()/BUG_ON() was only if the condition lead
directly to a filesystem-corrupting bug.
