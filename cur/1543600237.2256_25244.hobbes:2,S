As it turned out, the oopses are not correlated with the bank 
interleaving. I can turn the feature on and off and system stability 
remains the same (which is good enough to write this mail under X and 
compile a kernel).
The other features that this BIOS upgrade (Award v. 2.9) includes are 
(from the MSI site):
-Add Bank Interleave item in the BIOS Chipset setup
-Adjust Vcore Voltage Sensitivity on Hardware Monitor
-Show CPU L1 and L2 cache size
-Don't Display Ghz for AMD K7 CPU
-Fixed that WD WD400BB-00AUA1 HDD fail in FDISK with nVidia Geforce2 AGP Card
In fact I do have a nVidia Geforce2 card. Another hypothesis is that the 
last fix, also fixes the oopses.
Tomorrow I will flash the BIOS back to 2.7 and see if I get the system 
back to the previous, unstable state.
