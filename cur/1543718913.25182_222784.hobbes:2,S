That might get you all the major maintainers.  You'll probably want to also
look at the release Changelogs, and possibly the BitKeeper logs as well - I
think the Changelogs show part of the #if/#ifdef cleanup I did as coming from
me, and part as coming from somebody else (Dave Jones?), since he forwarded
part to Linus. I never did bother checking what the BitKeeper notations were...
