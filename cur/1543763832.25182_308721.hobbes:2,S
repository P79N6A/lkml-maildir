Nope, they were simply moved to non-free, as it should. I believe the package
is waiting for NEW processing, but i also believe that the dubious copyright
assignement will not allow the ftp-masters to let it pass into the archive,
since it *IS* a GPL violation, and thus i am doing this in order to solve that
problem.

Not really. Once the, post-sarge, transition is done, you just will have to
load the non-free .udeb from the non-free d-i archive, or install the module
package from non-free, and you won't even notice.
Sarge kernels are messed beyond recognition in this anyway, but they are
freezed so ...
