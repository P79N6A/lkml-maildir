I'm quite happy to test that my header cleanups don't break things --
but there are many things which don't currently compile anyway.  I try
to enable the things I think my changes will break, but I didn't spot
the isapnp one my pci_dev changes broke.  Could I ask that you update
defconfig with your .config again so we can be sure things don't break
_your_ build?
