Here X freezes (Sysrq-b works) with DRI enabled (debian sid, x4.3.0.1,
kernel 2.6.11-rc3-mm2, radeon, drm as modules)

YOu are right. I only have to stop the mysql server and everything is
working. Thanks.
Only one thing (maybe covered somewhere else): After resuming (without
having stopped the usb system) my external mouse (USB) stopped working.
Is there a way to reactive the external mouse?

Great idea! I was really searching for something like this. I will check
as soon as you have something online wether I have to add something!
Best wishes

CORRIEVORRIE (n.)
Corridor etiquette demands that one a corriedoo (q.v.) has been
declared, corrievorrie must be employed. Both protagonists must now
embellish their approach with an embarrassing combination of waving,
grinning, making idiot faces, doing pirate impressions, and waggling
the head from side to side while holding the other person's eyes as
the smile drips off their face, until with great relief, they pass
each other.
