Larry, thank you for your post.  This is exactly the post I was looking
for to seed conversation on this subject.  Thank you for your testimony
into the value of regression testing.  Regression testing isn't a
panacea, but it can have great value if leveraged correctly.
In regard to your framework, this is very similar to some ideas we had
for our project.  We (SGI) have a regression testing framework in use
internally that is very similar in basis to your framework.  The major
difference is that it has been in use and development for years now. 
Its quite grandiose and complete -- I think we might open source it if
LTP came to need it.  For now, your framework is more along the line of
what we had in mind for LTP.
The exit status method is probably the simplest way of reporting test
results.  It makes it relatively easy for anyone to write tests (take
note you lkml lurkers).  Basically, writing a simple test goes something
like this:
Setup - get the proc environment ready to perform the test operation
Test - perform the test operation
Analysis - determine the success/failure of the operation
Cleanup - get ready to go away, cleanup scratch space, make sure system
is in a clean state
Exit - report results via exit status 0-PASS,!0-FAIL
Larry, I may hit you up for your test harness.  It may be a great place
for us to start.  We already have 90+ tests, and managing them is
already a problem.
Again, anyone interested in helping us with our project is encouraged to
participate:
