I've just looked at the i386 time.c source and can see no obvious way for -1
to be returned by do_gettimeoffset(). I note that this error is fixed in the
next time() call, so I would instead expect the error to be one involving the 
conversion of tv_secs/tv_usecs into the seconds return from time().
One possible way to check this out would be to change the test program from
using the time() call to using gettimeofday(), and to ignore tv_usecs.
Hope this helps,
Ruth
