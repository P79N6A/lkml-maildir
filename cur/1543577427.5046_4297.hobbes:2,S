Humm, I'm just curious,
Regarding in_interrupt(). How do you deal with soft interrupts?
Guys calling cpu_bh_disable() or even incrementing the count on
their own. I don't know if this acceptable but definitely can be done,
I prefer to rely on fact than on API.
Regarding local_irq_enabled(). How do you handle the code that
call local_irq_disable(), then spin_lock(), spin_unlock() and only
re-enable the interruptions ? In this case, you preempt code that
is supposed to run interruptions disabled.
Finally, regarding the test on the task state, there may be a cache issue
but calling schedule() has also some overhead.
