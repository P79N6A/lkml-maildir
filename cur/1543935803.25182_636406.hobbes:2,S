And the only way that user level CQs work on Altix now is 
that we apply our own patches to allocate them in the 
kernel (with dma_alloc_coherent()) them mmap() them back 
to user space. A bug in one of these patches recently led  
to considerable drama with several customers - I'd love 
to get a fix in mainline so we can drop our patches and 
avoid the possibility such theatrics in the future ;-)
