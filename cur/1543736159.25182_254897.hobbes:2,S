On the Pentium4 core, this is not a big deal because it runs out of the
trace cache (i.e. decoded in advance). However, on the Pentium III/M
(aka P6) core (i.e. Penitum III, Banias, Dothan, Yonah, etc.),
especially when an operand size prefix (0x66) changes the # of bytes in
an instruction (usually by impacting the size of an immediate in the
instruction), the P6 core pays unnegligible penalty, slowing down
decoding.
