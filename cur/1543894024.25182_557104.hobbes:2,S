Right, thanks.  This should repair it:
From: Paul Fulghum <paulkf@microgate.com>
Restore tty locked ioctl handler which was replaced with
an unlocked ioctl handler in hung_up_tty_fops by the patch:
commit e10cc1df1d2014f68a4bdcf73f6dd122c4561f94
Author: Paul Fulghum <paulkf@microgate.com>

    tty: add compat_ioctl
This was reported in:
[Bug 8473] New: Oops: 0010 [1] SMP
The bug is caused by switching to hung_up_tty_fops in do_tty_hangup.  An
ioctl call can be waiting on BLK after testing for existence of the locked
ioctl handler in the normal tty fops, but before calling the locked ioctl
handler.  If a hangup occurs at that point, the locked ioctl fop is NULL
and an oops occurs.
(akpm: we can remove my debugging code from do_ioctl() now, but it'll be OK to
do that for 2.6.23)
