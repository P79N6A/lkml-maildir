Another problem with skip lists is that they require variable sized nodes,
so you either need to keep free chunk lists and lose some space in deleted
nodes kept in these lists, or you choose to shift remaining nodes which is
slow and complicated as you need to keep the inter-node links right. With
hashing, you can separate the control part of the structure and the actual
data and shift data while leaving most of the control part intact.

I don't understand this complexity estimate -- it cannot be the same for
whatever number of entries as the complexity function depends on the number
of entries.
				Have a nice fortnight
