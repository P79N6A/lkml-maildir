Well the code appears simple enough, but I've not previously heard anyone
express a need for this feature.  But I know how to cc people who might
have heard this.
Minor coding-style observations:

The fields of this struct need a leading tab.
The name "suspremount" might be unpopular.  suspend_remount_state would be
more kernely.

The typecast is unneeded, and the compounded assign-and-test is not
preferred style.  So here, please use
	struct suspremount *remountp;
	remountp = kmalloc(sizeof(*remountp), GFP_KERNEL);
	if (remountp != NULL) {

Why is this exported to modules?

newline needed here.
super_block_operations.remount_fs() is supposed to be called under lock_super().
Some filesystems might go BUG over this, or something.   Was there a reason to
not do this?

Why the export?
All this code is singly-threaded at a much higher level (I hope), hence
that list doesn't need locking.  However a comment explaining this might be
good.

We try to avoid putting ifdefs in C files.  So in a header file, do
struct super_block;
#ifdef CONFIG_SUSPEND_REMOUNTFS
extern void suspend_remount_log_fs(struct super_block *sb);
#else
static inline void suspend_remount_log_fs(struct super_block *sb) {}
#endif

Ditto here.

And here.
