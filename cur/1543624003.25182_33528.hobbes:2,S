Unfortunately my Athlon based system on 2.5.6 boots,
but I get tons of messages about unresolved symbols from
particular modules during X startup - which is a sign
for the fact that the recent memmory management changes
found between pre2 and pre3 are still hossed.
My intel based notebook however appears to be working.
(Im of course choosing the processor type on both systems...)
