A new current ide/sata disk should do around 60mb/second, check the
min/max bps rate listed on the disk companies site, and divide by 8, and
take maybe 80% of that
Also you may consider using the -l option on the scp command to limit
its total usage.
This feature has been around at least 8 years (from 2.2) that high
levels of writes would significantly starve out reads, mainly because
you can queue up 1000's of writes, and a read, when the read
finishes there are another 1000's writes for the next read to
get in line behind, and wait, and this continues until the
writes stop.
