   I think it is more than a little unfair to let the ext2 folks rewrite
   VFS and ext2 in parallel, and then announce an impending code freeze
   right after VFS has been radically changed.  
For the record, it wasn't the "ext2 folks" that rewrote VFS, and most of
the changes happened fairly early in the 2.3 kernel series.  If you had
been following the 2.3 kernel development, you should have had plenty of
time to deal with the VFS changes.  It wasn't like the VFS changes went
in just before the code freeze.
