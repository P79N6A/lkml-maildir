That shouldn't be a problem at all.  Since each architecture is responsible for 
defining the 5 main topology functions, you could do this:
#define _cpu_to_node(cpu)	(cpu)
#define _memblk_to_node(memblk)	(memblk)
#define _node_to_node(node)	(node)
#define _node_to_cpu(node)	(node)
#define _node_to_memblk(node)	(node)

For that, you need to look at the Memory Binding API that I sent out moments 
after this patch...  It builds on top of this infrastructure to allow binding 
processes to individual memory blocks or groups of memory blocks.
