I think is ok to use such XXX_CONFIG_COMPAT and #ifdef the register_ioctl calls 
around it in the driver. Acceptable for 2.4. Comments?  
I think you are right about checking for IA32_EMULATION too. 
Does SPARC also define it?
The MPT fusion driver currently does:
#if (defined(__sparc__) && defined(__sparc_v9__)) || defined(__x86_64__)
#define MPT_CONFIG_COMPAT
#endif
