Hi all,
     When I compiled 2.4.1 kernel  on a 2.2.14-5.0 installation (redhat
6.2) ,the following error occurred . But errno.h is there in
/usr/src/linux2.4.1/include/linux/   directory. Have anyone experienced
this problem.
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -o
scripts/split-include
scripts/split-include.c
In file included from /usr/include/errno.h:36,
                 from scripts/split-include.c:26:
/usr/include/bits/errno.h:25: linux/errno.h: No such file or directory
make: *** [scripts/split-include] Error 1
Thanks & Regards
Shiju
