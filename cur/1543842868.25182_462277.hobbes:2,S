This can't be right.  Together 1 and 2 would obviate the need for wmb().  
The CPU doing "STORE A; STORE B" will always see the operations occuring
in program order by 1, and hence every other CPU would always see them
occurring in the same order by 2 -- even without wmb().
Either 2 is too strong, or else what you mean by "perceived" isn't 
sufficiently clear.
