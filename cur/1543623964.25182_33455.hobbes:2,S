I just mean the kernel shouldn't panic if I don't have it.

Yup, though I suppose we could shave off a couple of nanoseconds by 
surrounding my little check with #ifdef CONFIG_NUMA.

With the #ifdef, I won't really do this either (at least for the code generated).
The SGI patch is probably a good thing, and I'll pick it up and try it 
sometime soon. The only real problem is that it's not in the mainline
already. Until such time as it gets there, the fix I posted is trivial,
and easily seen to be correct (well, I'm biased ;-) ), and should get
shoved into the mainline much easier.
