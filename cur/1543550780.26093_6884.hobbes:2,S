ok.

yes, it's just what I've discovered yesterday evening.
I'll attach the complete bonding.txt here, and rebuild
the patch later.

ok, very interesting. IMHO, the only way to get into
this trouble is a problem when setting a link up. I'll
try to investigate, perhaps I'll have access to a
dual-ppro today.

so the MII in the interfaces drivers works correctly.

I believe the eepro driver can reset itself under
certain conditions (it includes its own timer for
this). I don't know exactly why, but if this happens,
I can imagine the trunk seeing the interface go down.

this tends to validate the last possibility.

ok, the problem checking for no active interface
came again.

you should have had only one CPU completely stuck in
the xmit loop, and the other one processing your
keyboard inputs.

nope, the problem should come from my code (very few
experience in SMP code, only multi-threading you
see:-)

So Thomas was right.

very interesting bug. This may explain the activation
problem at start time on SMP.

your switches are very interesting. My alteon AD3 take
between 1 and 40 seconds to understand that the MAC
address changed its port.

I've written a little about thus problem in the doc.
It
was in the TODO to add two timers : one for link down,
one for link up. My alteon take about 10 seconds to
reboot.

when compiled as a module, you're not limited anymore.
Thanks very very much for all your tests. I'll try to
investigate on the bugs (SMP and link loss). I'll
think
about adding an "up delay" and "down delay" per slave,
to avoid hurry detection.
will try SMP today and others bug this week-end.
Cheers,
Willy
