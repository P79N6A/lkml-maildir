hi
 i am try to set aside some memory so i can do some dma
so i put this in the kernel 2.3.38 init/main.c
        dma.BufferKernAdd = vmalloc( dma.BufferSize )       ;
        dma.BufferPhysAdd = virt_to_phys(dma.BufferKernAdd) ;
        and then filled the space with nnnnnnnnn
    so i got the memory fine and then in my user program
    i use mmap
    ( NULL , dma.BufferSize , PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE , MAP_SHARED,
        /dev/mem , dma.BufferPhysAdd ) ;
    this worked ok but i can not read the mem
so can some one please help me on this and also
Thank you
    David <sector2@ihug.co.nz>
what if i used change_protection(....) can this let the memory be readed
from user space (i just dont know the pgprot flags)
