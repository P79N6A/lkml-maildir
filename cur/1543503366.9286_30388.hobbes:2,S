There is a project going on at the University of Michigan to get Linux
to support large uids.  U of M is one of the few institutions that
actually requires large uids to accomodate all of its users, so such a
patch is very integral in getting the University to start offering Linux
on some of its machines.  Alot of work has been put into this effort
and I believe they have a patch which is mostly fuctional.  I think
the only things they have to work out deal with some versions of
glibc, but the web page should tell you more. You can find information
about the project at
