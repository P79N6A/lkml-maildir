The higher orders can fail and will then result in the allocator doing
order 0 allocs. It is not a failure condition. Higher orders are an
advantage because they localize variables of the same type and therefore
reduce TLB pressure.

Queues require maintenance which introduces variability because queue
cleaning has to be done periodically and the queues grow in number if NUMA
scenarios have to be handled effectively. This is a big problem for low
latency applications (like in HPC). Spending far too much time optimizing
queue cleaning in SLAB lead to the SLUB idea.
