On ftp.kernel.org under kernel/people/aeb two files
03-2.4.6pre3-remove-real_devices and 04-2.4.6pre3-remove-max_p
that remove the fields real_devices and max_p from a struct gendisk
(and initialize such structs with the field: syntax).
The patches could be applied today, except that probably the
definition of the struct itself should stay unchanged in case
it is used in modules that live outside the kernel.
