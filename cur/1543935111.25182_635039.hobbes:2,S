Hi All,
Please CC me on your responses
I am working on Kernel 2.6.22.1 mmc host  drivers. I recently found that
mmc driver in kernel 2.6.23.1 supports bounce buffers. I wanted to use
bounce buffer feature.
I do not  want to go to Kernel 2.6.23.1. I want to be at 2.6.22.1, but
I need mmc driver in 2.6.23.1.
Can I replace drivers/mmc directory in 2.6.22.1 with drivers/mmc
directory in 2.6.23.1.   Does this cause any issues. Is there any code
in drivers/mmc in 2.6.23.1 which depends on other features in kernel
2.6.23.1.
Thanks in advance for your help
