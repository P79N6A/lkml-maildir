Well, let's not get too hung up on the disk thing (yeah,
I started it...).
Ben's intent here is to *demonstrate* how argv-style
info can be passed into device nodes.  It seems neat,
and nice.
We can also make use of a strong argument parsing library
in the kernel - there are a great number of open-coded
string bashing functions which could be rationalised
and regularised.
So.  When am I going to be able to:
	open("/bin/ls,-l,/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY);
?
