The market for secondary heads is too small.  You can get an ATI Mach 64 
PCI card for pennies and add it as a second head for what you're describing.
For an open-source graphics card to be marketable, it would have to be 
attractive as a primary head used in Linux workstations and servers, and 
it would have to be so in a PC market.

The irony is too much.  Seriously.

Adding extra heads is relatively easy, and you can keep the memory 
unified and do it all in one chip.
