I've got kernel 2.2.1 running on x86. With the atyfb framebuffer driver
enabled, if I run an X server while the console is already displaying
another X, the machine locks solid.
i.e. X :1 from inside an xterm running on display 0 causes the machine to
freeze. This also works if the X :1 is done via a remote login, if my console
is set to display 0.
The X server starts properly if the framebuffer driver is disabled. It also
starts properly if the console is displaying a text vt rather than display 0.
