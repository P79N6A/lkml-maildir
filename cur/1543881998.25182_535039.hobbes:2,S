Nice 0 as a default for X, but if renicing, nice -10 as the lower limit for X 
on SD. The reason for that on SD is that the priority of freshly woken up 
tasks (ie not fully cpu bound) for both nice 0 and nice -10 will still be the 
same at PRIO 1 (see the prio_matrix). Therefore, there will _not_ be 
preemption of the nice 0 task and a context switch _unless_ it is already cpu 
bound and has consumed a certain number of cycles and has been demoted. 
Contrary to popular belief, it is not universal that a less niced task will 
preempt its more niced counterpart and depends entirely on implementation of 
nice. Yes it is true that context switch rate will go up with a reniced X 
because the conditions that lead to preemption are more likely to be met, but 
it is definitely not every single wakeup of the reniced X.
Alas, again, I am forced to spend as little time as possible at the pc for my 
health, so expect _very few_ responses via email from me. Luckily SD is in 
pretty fine shape with version 0.46.
