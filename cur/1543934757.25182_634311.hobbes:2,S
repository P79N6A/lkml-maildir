Andi, this behaviour is obviously silly. 
I know that you do not care about white space and consistent coding
style, but others do.
The kernel process request that _all_ contributors run their patches
through checkpath.pl and fix the problems. The review process is the
same for _all_ contributors and I'm not going to add an extra Andi
attitude mode to it.

It's not a question of what you think. It's a question of what the
code does and what the meaning of the command line parameter is:
/*
 * Setup routine for controlling SMP activation
 *
 * Command-line option of "nosmp" or "maxcpus=0" will disable SMP
 * activation entirely (the MPS table probe still happens, though).
 *
 * Command-line option of "maxcpus=<NUM>", where <NUM> is an integer
 * greater than 0, limits the maximum number of CPUs activated in
 * SMP mode to <NUM>.
 */
There is no "one off" use in smp_init():
	for_each_present_cpu(cpu) {
		if (num_online_cpus() >= max_cpus)
			break;
so the above check needs to be "max_cpus <= 1".

It's not about warnings. It's about name spaces and it makes the
purpose of the global variable clear to the reader.
