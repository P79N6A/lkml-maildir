Understand something here. If 2.2.14 or 2.2.15 builds perfectly with gcc 2.95.1
I will be happy. I want it to build and work with all the new compilers. Equally
from a production perspective right now we know it doesnt work, right now
it hasn't had sufficient testing with the patches.
All Im trying to say is - if you are building a kernel to go out on CD, to
run on a web server, professionally for a client etc - be aware that 2.95*
is the wrong thing to build it with. If you want to build with 2.95.1 on
non critical machines and help change this then great, 
Alan
