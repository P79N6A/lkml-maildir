You can get this info by implementing inode_operations.setattr().  See the
callsite in fs/attr.c:notify_change().  You'd do something like:
ufs_setattr()
{
	loff_t old_i_size = inode->i_size;
	/* Stuff copied from notify_change(): */
	inode_change_ok()
	security_inode_setattr()
	inode_setattr()
	new_i_size = inode->i_size;
	....
}
