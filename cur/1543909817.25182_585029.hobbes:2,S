The latest maintenance release GIT 1.5.2.5 is available at the
usual places:
  
http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/
  git-1.5.2.5.tar.{gz,bz2}			(tarball)
  git-htmldocs-1.5.2.5.tar.{gz,bz2}		(preformatted docs)

  RPMS/$arch/git-*-1.5.2.5-1.$arch.rpm	(RPM)
Although 1.5.3 has been in -rc cycle for quite some time, there
was a rather nasty data corruption bug discovered, so here is
primarily to push that fix out.
When "git add -u $paths" records ONLY removes in a directory,
your next "git write-tree" will write out a bogus tree object
and cause your commit not to match the reality.
GIT v1.5.2.5 Release Notes
==========================
Fixes since v1.5.2.4
--------------------
 * Bugfixes
   - "git add -u" had a serious data corruption problem in one
     special case (when the changes to a subdirectory's files
     consist only deletion of files).
   - "git add -u <path>" did not work from a subdirectory.
   - "git apply" left an empty directory after all its files are
     renamed away.
   - "git $anycmd foo/bar", when there is a file 'foo' in the
     working tree, complained that "git $anycmd foo/bar --" form
     should be used to disambiguate between revs and files,
     which was completely bogus.
   - "git checkout-index" and other commands that checks out
     files to the work tree tried unlink(2) on directories,
     which is a sane thing to do on sane systems, but not on
     Solaris when you are root.
 * Documentation Fixes and Updates
   - A handful documentation fixes.
----------------------------------------------------------------
