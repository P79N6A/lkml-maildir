It also ignores the fact that tasks need things like page
tables, VMAs, etc...  The total kernel memory demand of
the maximum number of tasks the kernel allows by default
is way higher than physical memory.
I submitted a patch a while ago to set the number way lower,
which was accepted by Alan and in the -ac kernels. A few months
later Linus followed and changed the limit in his kernels, too.

Rik
