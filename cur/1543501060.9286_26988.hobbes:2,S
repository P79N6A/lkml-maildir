All proposals so far don't _prevent_ the users, even normal ones, from
messing around with the internals.  Frankly any reliable application is
going to have to deal with unexpected data in the file anyway.

These points merely argue for something that behaves like a directory
but doesn't look like one in an `ls' listing.
The only compelling reason I can see is:
  (1) Ordinary users wish to copy/move compound files as a single unit,
      attach them to emails and put them on web sites.
Which argues for automatic conversion to/from flat form on demand.
It could be done in user space, and a kernel hook could make it
transparent for all programs.
