Zeroing the entire swsusp region is a big job, especially if you want to
do it in a FIPS-conformant manner.  Hard to test that you've done it
right and not missed any bits.
Much much easier to securely erase just the key storage.
And unless I'm missing something, you meant to say "it will have been
zeroed" (after the patch under discussion is merged), right?  The
current state of the art (as of 2.6.12-rc2) is that mlocked regions are
written to the swsusp region and may linger there indefinitely after
resume.
(I haven't read the code, that's just my understanding of the
discussion.)

Ooof, that sounds complicated and error-prone, and likely to break
silently (a la input entropy gathering).
