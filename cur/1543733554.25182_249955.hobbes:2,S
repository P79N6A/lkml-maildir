Hello,
drivers/input/serio/serport.c can lead to kernel panic in serio code
followed by jbd's panic (probably due to random memory write, I don't
now) and/or system lockup.
Another drivers with the same desing (are there any?) can be vulnerable too.
Steps to exploit it:
process 1:
 open() a tty device;
 TIOCSETD it to N_MOUSE;
 read() it. it will block.
after that, process 2:
 open() the same device;
 TIOCSETD it to 0;
 TIOCSETD it to N_MOUSE; (not sure if it's necessary)
 kill() process 1;
If some code or more info is needed, please contact me, I'm not
at the list.
