Actually, that's not possible, because no difference is permitted.
When the initiator drives an address, there are 4 cycles during which
a targer can assert DEVSEL# to indicate that it will claim the bus
cycle.  The first three are known as "fast", "medium", and "slow", and
are for normal devices.
The fourth cycle us reserved for subtractive decode.  A subtractive decode
devices must assert DEVSEL# on this cycle and no other.  (If and only if
no other device has claimed it by asserting DEVSEL# already.)
On the fifth cycle, the initiator is permitted to perform a master abort
and fail the operation.  Because the initator could be any random bus master
card, cards are going to be installed in a system, you can't rely on it
giving a bridge any longer to assert DEVSEL#.
