Title provides the same amount of information the system is providing me
<g>.  No log messages, no fanfare.  Just absolute, solid lock when logging
into X via XDM.  Doesn't even respond to magic sysreq!
Machine is a dual-PII SMP using Intel DK440LX motherboard, 128MB ram,
built-in Adaptec UW SCSI.  I've been running this box hard for two months,
and it most assuredly doesn't happen on other kernels (e.g. 2.2.7-ac2 or
2.2.9).
Wish I had more information to provide.
Steve
