Are there? Nevertheless the synthetic UP probably wouldn't hurt much,
because it will only happen some 270 ms after the press at which time
the user did probably already release the key, and if he did not, we
just ignore the real release event.
I have that logic running on my computer and so far it doesn't cause any
trouble.

It's not perfect, but it's the best what we can do if we don't want to
move translated mode support to atkbd, which I definitely don't.
The problem is that only data below 0x7f is translated, by a mostly 1:1
table (there are two exceptions, 0x83 and 0x84). Data above 0x80
inclusive is not translated.
So, if you get a 0x9f code, you need to decide whether it really was
0x9f coming from the wire, or if it was actually 0xf0 0x27 coming from
the wire.
The code has a slight problem with multiple key releases for a single
key without a press event inbetween (which is what the toshiba does, and
I've got another keyboard which does it, too). I already have a fix for
that.
