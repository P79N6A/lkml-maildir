I'm speaking about scheduling times that, as You can see inside the
IBM guys ( Ray Bryant and Bill Hartner ) article
http://www-4.ibm.com/software/developer/library/java2/index.html
waste a great percent of CPU time under high workload, due to the fact that
the actual scheduler linear scan the runqueue to find the best task to run.
My approach gives a logarithmic response versus the linear of the current.
My test suite is poor and is for this reason that I like if someone having a
best
testing console ( like IBM guys and others I hope ) gives a test to the
patch.
My Jun99 patch also includes a semaphore wake_up() rewrite that instead
releasing all the N processes waiting in the queue for reschedule N-1 of
them,
it find the best task to release inside the wake_up() function.
This patch avoid the peak of N processes flushed into the scheduler.
Think about processes waiting for a connection into a socket for example.
This patch is for 2.3.5.
Cheers,
    Davide.
