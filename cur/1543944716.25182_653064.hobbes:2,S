Thanks.  At this moment I'm not sure whether it's a problem of
multi-cards or of HDMI.  Could you check the following?
- check "aplay -vv -Dplughw:1 foo.wav" to whether you get oops as
  well.
- add enable=1,0 option to snd-hda-intel driver.  This will load only
  the first card (onboard).  Check whether the problem occurs.
- add enable=0,1 to snd-hda-intel.  This will enable only the graphic
  card device.  Check again.
