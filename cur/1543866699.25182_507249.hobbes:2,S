Wow, great news on this rainy saturday! ;-)
The driver works perfectly, I'm writing this mail via wireless link. However 
there are two things to note:
The driver generates two network devices. The second one is for promicious 
mode? Is there any chance to disable the interface? ifrename renamed the 
wrong one to wlan0 and I had to tell my system to use eth1 for the wireless 
connection.
Second problem is that I can't unload the module. I get the message "FATAL: 
Module iwlwifi is in use." even if both interfaces are down.
