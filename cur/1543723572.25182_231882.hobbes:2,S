Paul,
Please review and forward upstream the following PCI EEH patch.
This patch allows ppc64 to boot on the Power5 architecture.  The 
new Power5 PCI bridge design requires EEH to be enabled for all PCI
devices, not just some PCI devices.  In addition, this patch moves
the check for PCI to ISA bridges out of perf critical code, and into
initialization code.   This also avoids race conditions where the 
device type might not have been set.  Also, some whitespace fixes, 
and some error-message-printing beautification.
