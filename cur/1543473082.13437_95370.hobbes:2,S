#1 Serial console? edit /etc/inittab and put a getty on /dev/ttyS0
#2 /dev/nvram?  userlandable
#3 intird? FS on the HD, or floppy. A custom 'init' will let you compress it.
#4 romfs? Minix is already there. Use read only mode.
NONE of these NEED to be in the kernel. They are in there because they work
BETTER, and offer greater flexablity.

THE POINT IS IT IS MUCH MORE FLEXABLE THEN THAT. Get it through your skull.
