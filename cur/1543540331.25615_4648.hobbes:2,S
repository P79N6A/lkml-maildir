Just a coding style change:
#ifdef __KERNEL__
#define HZ CONFIG_HZ
#else
/* Exported API has HZ equal to 100. This is a constant, and not going to
   change the next millennium. */
#define HZ 100
#endif
Note that a Certain mr. Linus B. Torvalds is going to prefer:
#define HZ CONFIG_HZ
without the #ifdef around it.
