I have had private patches for that myself, using the MSRs on AMD
and Intel.
The problem is that you have to insert hooks early into the exception
handlers to read the branch history MSRs, and that gets fairly ugly
and a little slow and we can't really enable it by default.
But using BTS with a long in memory buffer would be fine. It would
just be slower so it couldn't be enabled by default. But as a debugging
feature it would be nice.
