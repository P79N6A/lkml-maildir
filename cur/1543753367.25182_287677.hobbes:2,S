This patch probably should probably use atomic_inc in case we ever
have non-serialized probe functions.
But the real question is whether we really need class devices have
unique names or we could do with inputX thus leaving individual
drivers intact and only modifying the input core. As far as I
understand userspace should be concerned only with device
capabilities, not particular name, besides, it gets PRODUCT string
which has all needed data encoded.
What do you think?
