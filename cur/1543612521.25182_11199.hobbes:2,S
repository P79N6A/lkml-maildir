That is what I said ....
2.5.1           Semi-stable kernel, after bio is working.
2.5.2-pre1      Add the kbuild 2.5 and CML2 code, still using
                Makefile-2.5, supporting both CML1 and CML2.
2.5.2-pre2      Remove kbuild 2.4 code, rename Makefile-2.5 to Makefile.
		Still supporting both CML1 and CML2.
2.5.2-pre3      Remove CML1 support.
Is that timetable acceptable?
