Dave,
It depends on what you mean by killed off.  I submitted a patch to Linus back
at 2.5.3 to clean up the way the completion code called the wait queue
interface.  This interface got added then.  You picked up those changes at
that time (and still have them in your kernel tree) but the changes have
never made it into Linus' tree.
So, Linus has never had the code to 'kill' and you've never dropped it
after picking it up.
