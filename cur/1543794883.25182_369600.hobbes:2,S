Of _course_ "irq0" is a valid irq. On PC's, it's usually the timer 
interrupt.
It's the "dev->irq" _cookie_ zero that means it is does not have an irq.
If you have a physical "irq 0" that is bound to a device, it needs a 
cookie, and that cookie can't be 0, because that means the device has no 
interrupt.
How hard is that to understand? Why do people mix these up?
