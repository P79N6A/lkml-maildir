	INAL.  Observable facts (such as absolute numbers) aren't
derivative (in the U.S.) because there's no "creativity"***.  See the
famous court decision (... web search ...)  "Feist Publications
v. Rural Telephone Serv. Co.", for example.  Of course, the DCMA (or
other fell beasts) may have superseded that legal doctrine.
