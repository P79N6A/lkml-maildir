Agreed.  I also like the change that you initialize jiffies to a pre-wrap
value, so the jiffies wrap bugs can more easily be found/fixed.

I would say that the race is so rare that it should not be handled, especially
since it adds extra code in the timer interrupt.

Maybe this could be condensed into a macro/inline, so that people don't
screw it up (and it looks cleaner).  Like get_jiffies64() or so, for
those few places that really care about the full value and can't stand
a miniscule chance of a race (i.e. uptime output is not a candidate).
Cheers, Andreas
