I asked adaptec about a month anda half ago and got the usual blah, blah
and Win + Novell praise and they were unable to answer anything about support
under linux, solaris and BSD.
After that I asked this question on linux-network on Oct 13 and the
answer from Donald Becker was yes. Check the linux-network archive for the full
thread... (I am not subscribed to linux-net). 
The driver for the new ones is not tulip (as per the old web page instructions
on what google returns for you) it is the starfire:
ftp://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/linux/drivers/test/starfire.c
Good luck with the board and best regards,
