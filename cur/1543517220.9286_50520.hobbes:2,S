Loooooong time => Few monthes.
Yes, but unfortunatly, one of your distributions went with that *BUG*, and people using it suffered from it.
I have more than twenty customers which I've install Linux, I cannot afford such a bug for anyone of them.
I even don't have enought time to upgrade each of them for problems not *mentionned*. A distribution *shouldn't*
include such a bug, or it's not a professional distribution. Fulldot. Definitly, Mandrake is not a profesionnal
distribution. Just for kids. I'll resume my story and I'll post to slashdot. Mandrake is *not* serious enough for
professional business. Fulldot.
I'm furious against MandrakeSoft, as I had to admit to my bosses Linux's perfect but distributions aren't.
