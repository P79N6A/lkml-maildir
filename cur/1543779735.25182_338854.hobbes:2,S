   Ok, I can see the scenario where that could produce jitter.  However,
that implies than any exit through that path could produce jitter as it
is.  For instance:
CPU0				CPU1
read lcycle
read itc
				read lcycle
				read itc
cmpxchg
				oops, lcycle is stale
So the window already exists for this...
