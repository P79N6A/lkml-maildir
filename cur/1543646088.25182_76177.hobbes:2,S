The limit in the number of messages was added a few years ago, older 
linux kernels [2.0, early 2.2] contain no limit at all :-(
The implementation was choosen to avoid breaking apps that relied on the 
old behaviour: by default send x-byte messages, but if the queue is 
full, send a 0-byte, msgtype > 0 message that notifies a supervisor 
process that the queue is full.
SUS permits a global system imposed limit on the number of messages, but 
IMHO 9 MB is not excessive [actually, 16*9MB, once for each queue] - 
root can reduce the limit further, if users abuse it.
