Subject: I discussed reading directories as files with jra, Stallman, and loic

It was two separate conversations, but they both go together.  I ask
that they correct me if I unfairly summarize their words.
Jeremy wants in the FS what he can get with Microsoft streams and
Macintosh forks.  That is, he wants to be able to name an object, and
read it, and get something, and he wants to be able to add something
that goes into that object, and stays with it when the object gets moved.
He wants this because he is a Samba author, and it will make his life a
lot easier to have it when Windows 2000 comes out.
I convinced him that directories can do this, and do it cleaner than
that MS crud they use as an FS model.  The directories need a few
features added though.
First, they need to be able to have a file that when you read them they
resolve to.  That is, inside the directory there is one file that when
you open (dirname) you get a file descriptor pointing to
dirname/default.  Now please note that dirname/default can be a symlink,
a hard link (presumably to a file within the same directory), it can be
all sorts of things.  It can also be called something like "....", or
even "".  I have to think some about which I like.
Next files need to be able to inherit stat data, so that a file can
share its modification time with its parent directory, so that modifying 
the file changes the mod time on the directory.
Finally, you need a new file type flag indicating that it is both a file 
and a directory.
Now let's skip ahead to my conversation with rms and loic@ceic.com which 
came after talking with Jeremy..
This time we discussed how you might read and edit the contents of a
directory as an aggregation within one buffer.  The examples were
editing /etc/passwd and /etc/services within emacs, with passwd and
services converted into directories.  Imagine that passwd is converted
into a directory, with each line being a separate file, and each file
(line) having a separate modification time.  Clearly something useful.
Reading it is easy, you have a read on the directory return the
concatenation of the files.
How do you edit it?
Proposed answer: have the concatenation contain separators.  rdf (not
rich document format, but some XML replacement also called rdf) was
suggested by Loic@ceic.com as the standard for the separators.  I don't
know anything about rdf, but I am willing to believe it might work for
this since loic@ceic.com thought so.  This way emacs needs not a single
modification to be able to effectively edit it.  (emacs already has a
"narrowing" feature....)
How do you order it?  It's important for the /etc/services
file-directory that it be ordered.
Proposed answer: implement file content inheritance.  That is, allow one
file to inherit the contents of another file.  Then you can implement
the dirname/default file as a file which inherits the various members of
the directory in a specified order.  That file would not need to inherit
any of them, it could inherit none of them, in which case it would do
what Jeremy needs it to do for Samba.
In summary, implement the following:
* stat data inheritance
* file content inheritance
* resolve open/read(dirname) as open/read(dirname/default)
* implement a write which when done to a file with an inheritance flag
  set on it will look for and parse an rdf style syntax to determine how
  to perform the write.
rms is Bcc'd in case he doesn't want a lot of emails.
Thanks to a lot of suggestions, I think this is finally reaching the
point where it will be really rather useful....  Comments?
