I don't see any reason you cannot include the line 'MODULE_LICENSE("GPL")'
in the source code for your module so long as that source code is not a
derivative work of the binary. Whether or not you can distribute the
resulting binary is, however, a complex legal question.

No. The "additional right" to use the binary library file is not a right
under which your driver is licensed, so there are no additional rights to
your driver. The binary library itself is offered under rights much less
than the GPL.
What exactly is the license under which the binary is offered? If it's "may
be used with your driver" then you may have some interesting GPL issues when
people want to modify your driver and continue to use the binary firmware
with it.
Does this "binary library" actually run on the host computer? Or is it
firmware that runs on the modem only? Does it actually link in to the
driver?
