Stephen is correct here. Getting the capability
settings correct on all setuid programs is a
tough nut. Training people out of the root
model isn't easy, either.

The work underway for SELinux is different
from that of capabilities. POSIX capabilities
offer substantial benefits without the high
cost of SELinux.

This is not the experiance of Irix, which
has supported POSIX capabilities for years.

Yes. There is work to be done.

That's a matter of taste in policy. There
is certainly no Common Criteria requirement
for that.
Sure, SELinux and POSIX capabilities are
different. No arguement. POSIX capabilities
predate SELinux in the community and in the
Linux kernel. To date they have been limited
by the lack of xattr support, but now that 
that is available there is every reason to
complete the implementation.
