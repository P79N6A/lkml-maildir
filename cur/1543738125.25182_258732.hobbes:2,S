Please note that I said "into the higher levels" and not "into line
disciplines" - I completely agree with you.  For the general case,
line disciplines do not need to know that the CTS signal has been
deasserted, or that DCD has deasserted - these are all meaningless
to the vast majority.
There are special cases though, such as the one being discussed in
this thread, where it does make sense for the line discipline to
override the default behaviour.
