Dear Kernel Coders,
Kernel 2.0.x used the 'securelevel' variable to set or unset security
restrictions in the kernel. Now kernel 2.2.x uses 'securebits'. I read
securebits.h, but didn't understand the different possible settings for
this variable.
Can anyone tell me what settings are possible for this variable, how to
set them, and what the different settings mean ?
