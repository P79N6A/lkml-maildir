Ah, right, that stuff.
IIRC that VIA on-board off-board on-again thing has still been rearing
its ugly head after 2.6.17, with a longish recent discussion on LKML
(~3 weeks ago?) where people were annoyed that it still had so many different
ways of breaking no matter how hard you tried to find a generic mechanism
that successfully applies to all devices out there.
As such I'm not surprised in the least that it's still not working for you.
Of course I don't know the thread by heart right now, but if you don't
manage to find it, then I'll try to dig it up.
