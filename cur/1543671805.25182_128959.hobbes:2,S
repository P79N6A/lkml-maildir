Got it. I patched sound_core.c and I have sound now. I'm assuming that 
was the only file that needed to be patched. Correct? Also, should the 
OSS soundcore option in menuconfig always be 'Y'? It seems to not want 
to be anything else.
I get this warning on almost every file during the compile.

Another trivial patch perhaps?
Thanks for the patch!
