Thanks again.  I've rewritten the patch to use __get_free_pages().

nilfs2: fix problems of memory allocation in ioctl 3
This is another patch for fixing the following problems of a memory
copy function in nilfs2 ioctl:
(1) It tries to allocate 128KB size of memory even for small objects.
(2) Though the function repeatedly tries large memory allocations
    while reducing the size, GFP_NOWAIT flag is not specified.
    This increases the possibility of system memory shortage.
(3) During the retries of (2), verbose warnings are printed
    because _GFP_NOWARN flag is not used for the kmalloc calls.
The first patch was still doing large allocations by kmalloc which are
repeatedly tried while reducing the size.
Andi Kleen told me that using copy_from_user for large memory is not
good from the viewpoint of preempt latency:

He also advised me that:

For the function in question, the size of buffer memory can be reduced
since the buffer is repeatedly used for a number of small objects.  On
the other hand, it may incur large preempt latencies for larger buffer
because a copy_from_user (and a copy_to_user) was applied only once
each cycle.
With that, this revision uses the order 0 allocations with
__get_free_pages() to fix the original problems.
