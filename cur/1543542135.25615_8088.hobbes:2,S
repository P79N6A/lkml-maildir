This whole idea is flawed. The "top" program used to make a
similar error in %CPU handling. You simply must not attempt
to sum up the resources of multiple processes.
Consider processes that are created and killed before they
are seen. They will not count towards the total resource usage.

Note that this isn't a proper way to detect threads.
Consider two tasks that share everything but address space.
They share all file descriptors, the current working directory,
signal handlers, and parent. Are these tasks distinct processes?
I certainly think not; they are non-POSIX threads of a single
process.
BTW, lots of other people need a solution to this problem.
