Hi...
I have a Canon Powershot A70 and it used to work nicely with linux and
gnome. But now it has stopped working.
When I plug the camera, gthumb pops and try to import photos. But I get a
window with this message:
An error occurred in the io-library ('Error updating the port settings'): Could not set config 0/1 (Device or resource busy)
syslog shows this:
Jun  6 23:43:04 werewolf kernel: usb 5-2: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 6
Jun  6 23:45:38 werewolf kernel: usb 5-2: usbfs: interface 0 claimed by usbfs while 'gthumb' sets config #1
I have now 2.6.12-rc6-mm1. My USB pendrive works nicely.
Are you aware of any strange behaviour of USB in this kernel ?
What means the syslog message ? The kernel grabs the device to show in usbfs
and nobody can open it ?
TIA
