I'm confused as to which question Alan is asking, so I'll answer several :-)
    * "What is the licensing on the LSM module?" Crispin's pedantic
      response: there is no "the" LSM module. LSM is a patch to enrich
      the existing Linux loadable kernel module interface to allow
      access control modules. These modules do exist:
          * There is a dummy module (useful as a template) which just
            does the superuser check ("UID==0" and access is granted)
            and it is GPL'd.
          * There is a module that embodies the guts of POSIX
            capabilities, and it is GPL'd.
          * There is a port of SELinux to LSM (produced by the SELinux
            team) and it is GPL'd.
    * "Can you use the LSM interface with a non-GPL module, if you
      eschew GPL'd .h files?" Crispin's opinion: I dunnow, but the
      answer is the same as the answer for current Linux loadble kernel
      modules. If loading a module is "linking", then all modules &
      device drivers must be GPL'd.
    * "Can a non-GPL LSM module #include a GPL'd .h?" Crispin's opinion:
      I dunnow, but the answer is the same as the answer for many
      current Linux applications.  I know, this is the question Alan did
      not ask :-)
Crispin is not a lawyer/judge, so his opinion doesn't matter anyway :-)
