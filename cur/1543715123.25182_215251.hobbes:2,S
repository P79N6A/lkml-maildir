I got an unexpected response to this from someone.  They thought I was 
complaining about Linux.  On the contrary.  I was complaining about how 
hardware vendors suck because they have lousy support for Linux.
Some day, when Windows is a minor player, we'll have vindication, and 
vendors will have to provide open source drivers just to get business.  :)
