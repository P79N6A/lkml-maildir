Well, "noacpi" seems to be a synonym for "pci=noacpi".
Anyway, it causes acpi_disable_pci() to be executed, which according to
Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt means "Do not use ACPI for IRQ routing or
for PCI scanning" (it works like this on x86_64 too, although the doc says it's
x86_32-specific).
And yes, it matches "noacpiwhatever" in the command line with "noacpi".  Sigh.

earlyprintk=vga doesn't display anything (ie. black screen) and there are no
serial ports in the box.
