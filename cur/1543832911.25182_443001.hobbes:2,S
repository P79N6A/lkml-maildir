this patch (about to be merged in mainline) should fix it

Subject: fix false positives by giving sysfs inodes their own lock class
sysfs has a different i_mutex lock order behavior for i_mutex than the other
filesystems; sysfs i_mutex is called in many places with subsystem locks
held. At the same time, many of the VFS locking rules do not apply to sysfs
at all (cross directory rename for example). To untangle this mess (which
gives false positives in lockdep), we're giving sysfs inodes their own class
for i_mutex.
