I actually agree to some degree here. The main reason I agree is that
meta-data often is (a) known to be physically contiguous (so pre-fecthing
is easy and cheap on most hardwate) and (b) meta-data _is_ small, so you
don't have to prefetch very much (so pre-fetching is not all that
expensive).
Trying to read two or more pages of inode data whenever we fetch an inode
might not be a bad idea, for example. Either we fetch a _lot_ of inodes
(in which case the prefetching is very likely to get a hit anyway), or we
don't (in which case the prefetching is unlikely to hurt all that much
either). You don't easily get into a situation where you prefetch a lot
without gaining anything.
We might do other kinds of opportunistic pre-fetching, like have "readdir"
start prefetching for the inode data it finds. That miht be a win for many
loads (and it might be a loss too - there _are_ loads that really only
care about the filename, although I suspect they are fairly rare).
