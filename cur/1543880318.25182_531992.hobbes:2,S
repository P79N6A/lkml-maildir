hm. I've reviewed all uses of demux_lock. ./src/xine-engine/demux.c does 
this:
        pthread_mutex_unlock( &stream->demux_lock );
        lprintf ("sched_yield\n");
        sched_yield();
        pthread_mutex_lock( &stream->demux_lock );
why is this done? CFS has definitely changed the yield implementation so 
there could be some connection.
OTOH, in the 'hung' state none of the straces suggests any yield() call.
