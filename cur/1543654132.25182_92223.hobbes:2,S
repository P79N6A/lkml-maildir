Ah, see other thread (weren't you at the kernel summit?).  There's
currently no way to abort if you've exposed interfaces and then
something fails ("don't do that" is great except noone knows that, and
it's not always possible or nice)
The old module code used to just ignore it.  My code tries to catch it
and leaves the module stuck (except if !CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD, in which
case it can't really detect it).
Since we have a way of isolating modules for the symmetric race on
exit, it makes sense to use it on entry (of course, try_inc_mod_count
would have to keep violating the rule during the transition).
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
