You are correct that it only matters if we are interested in 8 byte
alignment. So it should be a non-issue for the 4-byte aligment case.

Yes, fs/binfmt_elf.c is one of the files that my patch modifies. There
are several elf note implementations in the kernel, all seem to use
4-byte aligment.
Implementations that use 8-byte alignment:
binutils-2.16.1/bfd/elf.c: elf_core_write_note() is using
log_file_align which is set to 3 on some 64-bit platforms.  8-byte
alignment in some cases.
binutils-2.16.1/binutils/readelf.c: process_corefile_note_segment() is
always using 4-byte alignment though.

Most applications probably expect 4-byte aligned data. OTOH, I just
came across HP's ELF-64 Object File Format document. It says that
8-byte alignment should be used:
http://devresource.hp.com/drc/STK/docs/refs/elf-64-hp.pdf
So now we have two documents that say 8-byte alignment should be used.

Ok. Vivek, Dave, anyone? Comments?
