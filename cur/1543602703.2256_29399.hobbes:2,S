Often there's kernel state which needs to be kept consistent, and locks
which need to be released - just bailing out (as if you got an oops) isn't
sufficient.
What's wrong with the plan of just implementing the appropriate cleanup code
in each buggy or lazy piece of code which sleeps in state
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE, and letting each be interruptible instead?
