Based on the e1000 documentation I have, the only thing required for
the e1000 to use MSI is to set the MSI enable bit in the PCI header.
Of course there may be some e1000 erratum involving MSI but I have not
been able to find any indication that this is the case.
It seems possible that there could be some problem in the core Linux
interrupt code even though some interrupts work -- for example there
could be a race condition triggered when a second interrupt is
delivered while handling the first interrupt.  However I couldn't find
any such bug, although I am not at all an expert about low-level
interrupt handling/APIC programming.
