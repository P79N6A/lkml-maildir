I'm wondering if it tries to use the MMX/XMM stuff for memcpy and friends. 
I'm also wondering why you'd be doing what you seem to try to be doing in 
the first place ;)
Basically, "no387" doesn't seem to disable any of the fancier FPU 
features, even though it obviously should. If you ask for math emulation, 
you'll get emulation faults for _all_ of the modern MMX stuff too (which 
we don't do). 
It's entirely possible that nobody has ever tested this combination.
