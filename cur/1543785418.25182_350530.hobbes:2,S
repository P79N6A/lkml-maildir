What business has userspace got of telling whether cmpxchg works on
an architecture by looking at kernel headers?
Even if an architecture provides an implementation of it, it might
rely on turning IRQs off, which may not be possible in userspace,
leading to the userspace version actually being non-atomic.
*Forget* kernel includes telling userspace what architecture
features are available.  It's extremely buggy by design.
If you want to remove HAVE_ARCH_CMPXCHG that's fine.  If userspace
complains, you've found a bug for them. 8)
