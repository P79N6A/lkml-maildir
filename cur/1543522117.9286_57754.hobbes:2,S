It should be moved from ide.c to ide-probe.c, for modules I think.
grep -in "ide_geninit" *
ide-probe.c:643: * init_gendisk() (as opposed to ide_geninit) is called for each major device,
ide-probe.c:645: * structures needed for the routines in genhd.c. ide_geninit() gets called
ide-probe.c:692:        gd->init        = &ide_geninit;         /* initialization function */
ide.c:551: * ide_geninit() is called exactly *once* for each major, from genhd.c,
ide.c:554:void ide_geninit (struct gendisk *gd)
ide.c:3402:EXPORT_SYMBOL(ide_geninit);
grep: paride: Is a directory
There is no reason to export, if we move it to "ide-probe.c" where it is
called.  I will test this move and it has to be harmless.
Will rip a patch against linux-2.3.40-4 and get it out tonight if every
thing is cool........

ide-probe.c:692:        gd->init        = &ide_geninit;         /*initialization function */
include/linux/ide.h:760:void ide_geninit (struct gendisk *gd);

Andries,
Where are all the callbacks to "dev->init(dev)" located for block?
