Could that be because there _is no_ maintainer for the config.in files?
Therefore, splitting up the MAINTAINERS file achieves nothing.
However, for the specific times that you've unfortunately come across
the problem, and one of the times it was to do with the ARM config.in
file, I can definitely say that the information _has_ been in the
maintainers file, and it _is_ up to date.  Here, let me give an
example:
ARM PORT
P:      Russell King
M:      linux@arm.linux.org.uk
L:      linux-arm-kernel@lists.arm.linux.org.uk
W:      
http://www.arm.linux.org.uk/
S:      Maintained
I don't think that you can say that the MAINTAINERS file has failed in
this case, and cutting it up into little pieces solves precisely
nothing.
