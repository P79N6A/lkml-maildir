Hi Stuart.

 > short description of each? Hope someone can help.
A list of the valid kernel parameters as of the 2.2.9 kernel is
included with the 2.2.10 kernel in...
	Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
...but this is just a list of the parameters and the subsystems they
refer to. I didn't have the time to document them all when I wrote
that list.
Best wishes from Riley.
