   NIPQUAD() is nice, but it still doesn't solve the problem I was
speaking about as you still need to have non-trivial things in
the format string which I would like to avoid.
   Also, for IP addresses you cannot cache the strings :))
   pci_dev->slot_name still looks like the best solution to me.
				Have a nice fortnight
