Ted, this is Ryan's root filesystem, so it _has_ to be mounted read-only
and have the kernel do journal recovery on it.  That said, there must
have been an error from the previous boot which caused it to have an
error recorded in the journal.
Rather than Ryan running dir-indexing on his root filesystem, I would
suggest that he instead test with a loopback filesystem to see if he
can reproduce the errors without destroying his data.  Ryan - you
should run "tune2fs -O ^dir_index /dev/hda2" to turn off indexing on
your root filesystem, and run a full e2fsck on it (e2fsck -f /dev/hda2).
After that, we'd be happy if you could test with a loopback filesystem:
touch /tmp/foo
mke2fs -j -F /tmp/foo 100000
mkdir /mnt/tmp
mount -o loop /tmp/foo /mnt/tmp
and run tests on /mnt/tmp instead of your root filesystem.
Cheers, Andreas
