Test code for this version (take 4) of the minimized LZO1X (from the liblzo 
v2) is complete. 
I don't see a significant slow-down comparing the complete liblzo2 to this 
minimized code on my system (Pentium M 1.73GHz, 1GB Ram, Kubuntu Feisty 
(stock Kubuntu kernel)). Rather, I see the opposite. This *might* have been 
caused by the dynamic linking (or similar) so rather than rely on simply 
doing "time xxx" I actually put checks around the calls to the 
compress/decompress functions themselves.
('Tiny LZO' is what I call Nitins extremely small implementation of 
lzo1x_[de]compress)
Output of the provided "test" script:
10 run averages:
'Tiny LZO':
        Combined: 113.2 usec
        Compression: 77.4 usec
        Decompression: 35.8 usec
'liblzo2':
        Combined: 140.7 usec
        Compression: 94 usec
        Decompression: 46.7 usec
(The "Combined" average is the average time taken for a compress+decompress)
TODO: 
-Implement userspace version of likely/unlikely
-Implement cpu_to_le16 so code functions on BE systems
