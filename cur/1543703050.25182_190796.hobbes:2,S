Hi,
Merging "straight" _bugfixes_ (I think all we agree that merging
performance enhancements at this point in 2.4 is not interesting) which,
as you said, get reviewed by Jens/James/others is OK.
What is this mlqueue patchset fixing ? To tell you the truth, I'm not
aware of the SCSI stack problems.
