  Bus  0, device  16, function  0:
    PCI bridge: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] AMD-768 [??] PCI (rev 4).
      Master Capable.  No bursts.  Min Gnt=12.
Sounds like a PCI bridge, the machine works just fine. What's "not
supported" about it?
I'm still running the 2.4.16, patched with an Andre-ide-patch.
