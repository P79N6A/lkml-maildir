if you enable APIC (and not ACPI) then you start using a different BIOS
table for IRQ routing. Several BIOSes have bugs in this table since it's
not a table that is generally used by Windows on UP boxes. Saying that
it's the kernel's fault is rather unfair; most (if not all) distros for
example ship with APIC disabled for this reason. It's nice if it works
for you but there's quite a few boxes out there that just can't work....
Don't configure it if you have such a box.
