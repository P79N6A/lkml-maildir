Using 0x80000000 is probably better anyway, no?  Just how many megs less
than 2GB does that give us - something like (2048-30) total?  Possibly
better than using 0x70000000, since the way I figure it, that robs us of
256 megs of process address space.  If you want a single process to use
as much RAM as possible (like nearly 2GB, and this isn't a silly case in
numerical codes) then it seems like you're actually better off
sacrificing the 30megs (or 50 or whatever) and using 0x8...

ps: who volunteers to remove the man-trap in page.h?
