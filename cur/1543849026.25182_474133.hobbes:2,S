I forgot to report how I've tested it.  Using the 'test' patch from
yesterday, I have two processes running lspci in an infinite loop.  When
I write a 1 to /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.0/block, they both
halt.  When I write a 0, they both resume.
Then I tried doing echo 0 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.0/block a
second time, and I got the WARNing I expected.
animal:~# echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.0/block                     
animal:~# echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.0/block                     
animal:~# echo 0 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.0/block                     
They both resumed (as expected; we don't support nesting).
animal:~# echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.0/block                     
animal:~# echo 1 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.1/block                     
animal:~# echo 0 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.0/block                     
animal:~# echo 0 >/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:01.1/block                     
Both resumed only after the second echo 0 (as lspci reads all devices
before printing anything).
It's not exactly rigorous testing, but I couldn't think of any other
cases to try.
