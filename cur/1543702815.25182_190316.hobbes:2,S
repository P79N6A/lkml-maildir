Nope. It does not. Tested on three versions of binutils:
[davide@bigblue davide]$ as << EOF

[davide@bigblue davide]$ objdump -D a.out 
a.out:     file format elf32-i386
Disassembly of section .text:

   6:   ff 37                   pushl  (%edi)
Disassembly of section .data:
Also, most important, the `make bzImage` does not give any warnings.
