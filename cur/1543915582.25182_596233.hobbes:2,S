sorry didn't check, what's the license of the firmware?

well thanks that would help us a lot,
we have to strip the firmware for Debian for the upcoming Lenny release.
as the shipping exception for the previous 2 releases will not be granted
again. so a separate firmware would be great. also afaik only some boards
need it. it is a pressing need for us as tg3 with stripped firmware of
course doesn't build.
