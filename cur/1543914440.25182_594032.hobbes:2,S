Subject: [patch 0/7] Add extended crashkernel command line syntax
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch adds a extended crashkernel syntax that makes the value of reserved
system RAM dependent on the system RAM itself:
    crashkernel=<range1>:<size1>[,<range2>:<size2>,...][@offset]
    range=start-[end]
For example:
    crashkernel=512M-2G:64M,2G-:128M
The motivation comes from distributors that configure their crashkernel command
line automatically with some configuration tool (YaST, you know ;)). Of course
that tool knows the value of System RAM, but if the user removes RAM, then
the system becomes unbootable or at least unusable and error handling
is very difficult.
This series implements this change for i386, x86_64, ia64, ppc64 and sh. That
should be all platforms that support kdump in current mainline. I tested all
platforms except sh due to the lack of a sh processor.
The patch series is against 2.6.23-rc4-mm1.
