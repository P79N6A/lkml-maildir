I agree for synchronous futexes, the inherent race conditions do
make it "user error".
For async futexes (FUTEX_FD), I think it has a well-defined and
potentially useful meaning to move futexes on remapping, if that's
what the program wants to do.
It's well-defined for shared mappings, and then it's even useful
(think database with locks distributed in an 8GB file).  So it's a
little odd for it to fail for private mappings.
I'm not wedded to the idea.  Just so long as it's mentioned in "man
futex" under "don't do this".
