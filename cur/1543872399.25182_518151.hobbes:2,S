Not necessarily.  Depending on the resource we are managing, and on how
all encompassing one chooses to make the virtualization, this might be
an overly Draconian permission model.
Certainly in cpusets, any task can see the the whole system view, if
there are fairly typical permissions on some /dev/cpuset files.  A task
might even be able to change those limits for any task on the system,
if it has stronger priviledge.
Whether or not to really virtualize something, so that the contained
task can't tell it is in side a cacoon, is a somewhat separate question
from whether or not to limit a tasks use of a particular precious
resource.
