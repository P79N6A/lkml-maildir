It's not going to happen for 2.4, that's pretty much given. 2.6 works
just fine, and I sure as hell don't want to risk breaking anything in
2.4 just to get a speed increase. Not at this point.
You also seem to forget that someone needs to do the actual work to make
it happen. It's not likely someone will, when they haven't already.
