Do you have framebuffer console enabled but with no framebuffer device
enabled at boot time?  This will always fail with James' current patch.
The diff I submitted in one of my replies in this thread (fbcon.diff)
might fix that (not sure).

I get this also. Seems to occur only with colored terms.  When I do 
set TERM=vt100
the problem disappears, so I thought this was an isolated case with my
