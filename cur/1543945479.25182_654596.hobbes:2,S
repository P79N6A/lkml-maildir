i'm not sure if it is possible to integrate this into the common code
(be great if we could), but we should codify the expected behavior for
the suspend/resume functions.  from looking at the 8 that implement
the pm functions, they seem to all do:
suspend(): turn off the watchdog
resume(): turn on the watchdog if it was running
some other issues raised:
 - this device should not be able to be selective suspended ... in
other words, you only want to "suspend" the watchdog if the whole
system is going to be suspend
 - should the nowayout option be checked at all ?
