It's 1 kobject == 1 sysfs directory. I recommend putting a kobject into 
the ID structure and registering it (by the PCI core) once the driver has 
been registered. Then, create files for each of the static IDs. 
When new IDs are added, I don't see why you need to differentiate between 
them in userspace. Couldn't you have e.g.:
/sys/bus/pci/drivers/3c59x/
`-- id
    |-- 0
    |-- 1
    `-- new_id
Then, when someone writes a new ID, have:
/sys/bus/pci/drivers/3c59x/
`-- id
    |-- 0
    |-- 1
    |-- 2
    `-- new_id
Internally, we of course need to treat them differently, but to the user, 
they're just IDs the driver supports..
