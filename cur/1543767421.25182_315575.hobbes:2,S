This can be redefined at any moment, fortunately, so there's no need to
agonize over this number. There is no backward or forward compatibility
problem. The sole purpose of that limit is to make a probe loop bound,
for initial testing.
Why would you want more though? I have a 12-in-1 reader which only
exports 4 LUNs. If someone attached enterprise storage arrays to USB,
it might be a good idea to remove the limit completely.
