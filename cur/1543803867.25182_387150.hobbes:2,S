Yes, this could be useful for this task (and looking what files are
created/deleted aswell), but it won't catch everything under the sun - 
adding support for a new device in a already existing driver, for 
example, or subtle changes in the semantics of a syscall, or adding
yet another sockopt() option; there're many small changes that are
"important".
For now, I just look at the subject line of every mail sent to the 
git-commits-head mailing list and decide from a quick look if
the change is important or not. It's a very fast operation so 
looking at a couple of hundreds of emails each day doesn't take
more than a couple of minutes; I waste most of the time trying
to understand what the change does to write a comprehensible
description and format everything to put it in the "·$%&/( crappy
HTML forms that wikis use. I agree that asking developers to "mark"
important changes wouldn't work well, so I guess this is the only
100% reliable method. Well, kernel releases are taking two months to
be released, so i guess I should not try to do everything as soon
as it is merged in the first two weeks but do the work in small 
chunks.
