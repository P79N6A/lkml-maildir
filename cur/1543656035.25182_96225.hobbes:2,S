Something seems odd about the athlon MP time, I've got a celeron 533
with slow disks that does a pretty standard make dep ; make of 2.4.20 in
7m05, which is not that much different considering it's a third the speed,
and one cpu instead of two.
The single P4/2.53 in another machine can haul down in 3m17s
Guess our kernel .config's or version must vary greatly.
