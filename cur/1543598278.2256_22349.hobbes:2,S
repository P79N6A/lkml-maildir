Can I propose an add_untrusted_randomness()? This would work identically
to add_timer_randomness but would pass batch_entropy_store() 0 as the
entropy estimate. The store would then be made to drop 0-entropy elements
on the floor if the queue was more than, say, half full. This would let us
take advantage of 'potential' entropy sources like network interrupts and
strengthen /dev/urandom without weakening /dev/random.
(Yes, I see dont_count_entropy, but it doesn't appear to be used, and
doesn't address flooding the queue with 0-entropy entries. I'd take it
out.)
