Don't be silly Pekka ... We have plenty oprofiles results if you dont trust 
Andrew.
CPU: AMD64 processors, speed 1992.52 MHz (estimated)
Counted CPU_CLK_UNHALTED events (Cycles outside of halt state) with a unit 
mask of 0x00 (No unit mask) count 100000
samples  %        symbol name
1861563   4.7882  tg3_start_xmit_dma_bug
1375727   3.5386  memcpy_c
1166438   3.0002  tcp_v4_rcv
1157334   2.9768  kmem_cache_free
In this workload (real server), you can see kmem_cache_free() is number four.
Adding one test and conditional branch in this super-hot function just to 
correct a bug in a SCSI driver (or whatever) is not *SANE*.
Numbers talk.
