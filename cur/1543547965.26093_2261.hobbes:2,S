Ehh? And exactly _how_ would a debugger help it.
Especially as Alan quoted an example of a driver bug that didn't get fixed
for several months because the maintainer didn't have the hardware.
What would a debugger have done? 
Are you _seriously_ expecting that non-programmers start using kernel
debuggers to send in good bug-reports? Grow up, get a clue, and smell the
roses. Not going to happen. Especially as a kernel debugger tends to
require a second machine, and even then you only get to break
automatically on events that would have caused a kernel oops anyway.
Otherwise you need to know a hell of a lot more, like setting breakpoints
etc.
Testing is important for device drivers. Debuggers are not.
