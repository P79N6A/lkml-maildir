If I type ^C after "this | that | other" I expect it to kill all the
threads in all the processes...  not just all the threads in one of the
processes.
Looks like an argument for another kind of process group, rather than
eliminating process ids for individual threads.
Larry's given a very nice set of reasons why different ids for different
threads is useful.
