grep:ing for the function-name using ^fname is a common use. Easily
solvable anyway, but...
I don't think Lindent does everything 100% correct; at least its
formatting of switch/case does look a little fishy:
	switch (option) {
	case 1: 
		/* blaha */
That feels kind of odd compared to the rest of the codingstyle.
