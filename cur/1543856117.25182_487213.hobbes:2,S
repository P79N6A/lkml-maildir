The previous I/O from cache hit and the later I/O for cache
replacement should be queued in order on the cache block device - is
this a safe assumption?

The current hash algorithm does clustering to some extent by mapping
consecutive blocks from the source device to consecutive blocks on the
cache device. But I agree that more sophisticated algorithms can be
studied.
Thanks a lot for the suggestions. I will try to incorporate them in
the next patch.
