The Makefiles do not regenerate kernel symbols correctly and IMHO the
code is beyond repair, i.e. the Makefile rules need a complete rewrite.
At the moment the only way to ensure that genksyms is run correctly is
mv .config ..
make mrproper
mv ../.config .
make oldconfig
make dep clean && make -j2 bzImage modules
-j2 assumes you have a dual cpu, remove -j2 for uniprocessor.
