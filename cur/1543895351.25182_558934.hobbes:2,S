No, i don't agree at all.
In this case, "no config needed" == "not possible to debug suspend problems".
IMO this is the same as issue as with "sysrq-C". You can crash the machine by
other means, but it sometimes is just handy to have a mechanism to do it.
I do not understand what's the problem with this option. If you want to avoid
that people use it for something else than debugging, i can add a patch that
crashes the machine ten seconds after resume if this option is set.
