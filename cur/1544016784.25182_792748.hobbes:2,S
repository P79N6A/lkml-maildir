CONFIG_* is not visible to userspace.  Furthermore, there is (almost) no
point in putting a structure definition under #ifdef unless it uses data
types that somehow depend on the configuration (and those data
structures would be fundamentally ineligible to be exported to
userspace!!) -- if the feature isn't configured the structure definition
just doesn't get used.

No, no, no, no, no.
We're not exporting CONFIG_* to userspace.
The point was that if we were using #if instead of #ifdef, then -Wundef
could be used to complain instead of silently ignoring sections.
