Would this work, or will it just create more confusion for the API user?
I mean, all sleeps can only guarantee "no less than".
Would it be enough for a binary (exact as possible / relaxed if needed)
flag? Or perhaps ternary (exact/relaxed/batched), where relaxed could
add an extra jiffy or so, and batched is really relaxed that may delay
up to double the value of the timeout.

But given that we know most userspace API timeouts are broadly just an
"equal to or greater", then we could add another timeout flag to specify
it is a userspace timeout, and make that controllable by sysctl.
Sure it isn't ideal, but for those who really want power / hypervisor
savings, it could be useful.
BTW. my futex man page says timeout's contents "describe the maximum duration
of the wait". Surely that should be *minimum*? Michael cc'ed.
