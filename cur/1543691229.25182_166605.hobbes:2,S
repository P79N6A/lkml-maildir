As Andrew showed me, this manifested itself like:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKC] (IRQs 3 4 *6 7 10 11 12)
...
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKC] enabled at IRQ 10
whereas the patch does:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKC] (IRQs 3 4 *6 7 10 11 12)
...
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKC] enabled at IRQ 6

Thanks for the patch Andrew ;-)  I tested this patch (or applicable
variation) on test3-bk3 (where the original breakage ocurred) up through
test5-mm2, all worked fine.  This patch doesn't actually apply to current
test5-bk (inline patch and url below) or test5-mm2 (inline patch and
url below) for those who'd like to test.
thanks,
