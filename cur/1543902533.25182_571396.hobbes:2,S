Put another way, once you enable VLAN header stripping, you
won't see the headers for *any* VLAN, not only for those you're
actually running locally. This is also a problem for devices
like macvlan, where it would be desirable to make use of
hardware VLAN accerlation. I was thinking about storing the
information somewhere in the packets meta-data on both RX and
TX paths, that would also allow tcpdump to properly display
packets.
I have planned to look into this when I find some time.
Your suggestion of disabling VLAN acceleration in promiscous
mode sounds like a reasonable solution until then ..
