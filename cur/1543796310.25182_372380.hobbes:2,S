Yeah, right.  I forgot to count them twice and I didn't take the kmalloc()s
into account.  I'll do my best to produce a patch for it ASAP.
BTW, every kmalloc() in there seems to take 32 bytes (ie. the smallest generic
slab object size), which is a bit wasteful.  The Andy's numbers indicate it
can take more than 700 pages just for that, and they have to be taken twice,
which gives more than 1400 pages total.  It could be as little as about 300
pages _total_ if we did it more carefully.  I think I'll place this on my todo
list for after 2.6.15.
Greetings,
Rafael
