Am I? what's with the *_limit() function called before the printk?

Not at the times when these occurred.

I don't mind having fun developing or placing funny error messages, and
I hadn't taken that as "serious problem" message but rather as "someone
in the wild tries to cheat on us" but how do I know?  I'm a bit more
cautious with network related stuff, particular with packet filtering
and things like that. I'd suggest that the fun be put in the comments,
or that funny error messages are accompanied by a plain text explanation
in parentheses, or there is at least a "dictionary" of error messages in
the comments of the *.c files that a geek could find...
