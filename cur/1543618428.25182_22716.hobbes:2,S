In the compilation of kernel 2.4.17, while creating the bzip'd image of
the kernel, gcc complains the lack of pcmcia_char.o and so the entire "Make"
operation stops with this error. Actually, I made a mistake by choosing
this driver to compile but if anybody need it... :-)))
PS: The kernel was not patched from previous versions, it was entirely downloaded
from a mirror of ftp.kernel.org
Yours Faithfully
