Hm, that's wierd.  I thought I got something, until I realized that you
are doing a lot of logic before you ever even determine that your
hardware is present in the system.  Why are you calling
calgary_locate_bbars() and doing all of that work?  Or am I mising
something in the code flow here?
Also, it looks like you use the pci_get_device() to find the pci device,
then you do somethings, and then drop the device, never to use it again.
So, a traditional "probe" might not work as well, but it could be used
if you want to.
