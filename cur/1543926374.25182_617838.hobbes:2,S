Just FYI:
It has been reported that while this patch fixes old LILO, and possibly 
some other boot loaders (unknown), it has also broken older versions of 
SYSLINUX: they still boot, but the command line is truncated (exactly 
how much depends on the BIOS, but typical values are around 130 bytes.)
This is definitely traceable to a bug in SYSLINUX that was already fixed 
in release 3.50 (the current version of SYSLINUX is 3.52).
I have chosen to leave the patch in mainline, rather than trying yet 
another recipe and hope it doesn't break on some other random 
combination of bootloaders, since:
a) SYSLINUX is generally easily updated, compared to other bootloaders;
b) The failure mode is less severe (it still boots.)
... however, you may choose to call differently.
