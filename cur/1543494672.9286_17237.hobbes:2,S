They can't. Many of the driver cards that NT uses use PIO. This, in
anybody's book, is a copy operation. There is one Intel board,
it has an i960 on it (don't remember the name), plus the regular
Intel chipset, that was designed for 'zero-copy' operation. There
is a NT driver for it. Even this is not 'zero-copy' although the
i960 does the copy instead of the ix86.
In the 'real world' about the only zero-copy that could work is
for datagrams, i.e., connectionless. If you are going to assemble
out-of-sequence and missing packets in 'user-land' I don't see
the advantage of zero-copy at all.
