It looks like someone found a work around for vmware.
As for proprietary VPN software, the one case that came of David Miller
said we had sufficient alternatives in the kernel that he didn't care.
We have to make a lot of changes to get the network namespaces
complete.  I don't have pity on any external code that breaks because
they won't let me at their code.
If it turns out the code that was broken was an unacknowledged
derivative work and it can't be fixed I have even less pity on
them.
