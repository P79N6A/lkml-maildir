 Think about extending hotplug to cover all device bindings.  It will
kick in very early in the booting process (maybe in the initrd image)
and names/binds every device on the device with appropriate arguments
as user requested.  I was thinking about usages like that when I was
making the sysctl node.  Maybe I was going too far. :-)

 How about making the command format "CMD ARGS" rather than
"{CMD|DRIVERNAME}"  i.e.
 not
 # echo e100 > drvctl
 # echo detach > drvctl
 but
 # echo attach e100 > drvctl
 # echo detach > drvctl
 But, I don't know.  It now just seems too much like a proc node.

 I kind of agree with you but I think either way is fine.
 Thanks.
