Actually measuring time through the network is extremely doable given
enough samples as is communication through delay perturbation. A good
viterbi encoder/decoder will fish a signal out of very high noise. Yes
you pay a lot in data rate at that point but it works.
Anyway at the point you pass the bytecode through a processing filter
you don't need SECCOMP because your filter can remove any syscall
attempts.
