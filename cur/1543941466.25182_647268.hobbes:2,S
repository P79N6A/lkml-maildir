I think i found issue, but not able to understand how to fix it.
I did small patch to make sure, that code able to change TCO_EN(bit 13) to 0. 
It cannot change it, because TCO_LOCK bit is set. I
For example i did patch to see that:

and i got in dmesg

[  589.913360] iTCO_wdt: TCO_EN after set 0000203B
So this function will not work in some conditions, for example in my 
situation. It is a bit dangerous, because as i understand function is 
supposed to disable unexpected reboots during watchdog setup, so maybe must 
be added check for TCO_LOCK bit, or just to check if value really has been 
changed.
Also i dont understand code:
TCO1_STS for example, to clear bit's needs to write 1 to each one (it is not 
WRITE, it is WRITECLEAR almost all of them, except Bit 0 on TCO1_STS which is 
Read Only) (i read that in ICH9 datasheet). So outb(0, TCO1_STS), just will 
not do anything.
TCO2_STS, bit 0 is responsible Intruder Detect on ICH8 and ICH9!!! Probably 
it is not good to reset this bit.
Code:
       /* Clear out the (probably old) status */
        outb(0, TCO1_STS);
        outb(3, TCO2_STS);
But that all small issues, and doesn't explain why it doesn't work. I did 
small patch, and instead of resetting timer, i am getting current value of 
timer.

Which means timer reaching 0... and, nothing happen! It goes again 2 and then 
again 0. I check even STS registers, they are still zero! Register just set 
back to default value 0004h.
Probably someone can help me with this? Or it is hardware bug of chipset?
I will try to look more docs, maybe i will be able to find whats wrong there.
