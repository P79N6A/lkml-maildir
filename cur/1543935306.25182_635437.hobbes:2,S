Subject: [RFC/PARTIAL PATCH 0/3] dma: passing "attributes" to dma_map_* routines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/7/393

The following patchset allows additional "attributes" to be 
passed to dma_map_*/dma_unmap_* implementations. (The reason 
why this is useful/necessary has been mentioned several times, 
most recently here:
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119258541412724&w=2.
)
This is incomplete in that only ia64 and x86_64 are supported - 
the purpose is mainly to give us something specific to discuss. 
The approach here is to change the dma_map_* interface so 
that the last argument is an u32 which encodes the direction 
of the dma and, optionally, other attributes. Changing the 
interface is a bit intrusive, but callers of dma_map_* don't 
need to be modified.
There are 3 patches:
[1/3] dma: create linux/dma-direction.h 
[2/3] dma: ia64/sn2 allow "attributes" to be used by dma_map_*
[2/3] dma: x86_64 allow "attributes" to be used by dma_map_*
