I had the same problem with my ASUS A7V and Soundblaster PCI64, 
and I know someone who had the same problem with a Gigabyte 7KX. 
Only link between us was the chip set and the sound driver (and 
the knowledge that it worked flawlessly under Windows and with
other chip sets on slower CPUs). 
So all claims linking this to CPU hungry programs or bad onboard 
hardware are simply wrong. Which Kernel version do you run? 2.2.17?
All I can tell you is that it is gone now. I wrote a wrapper
script around xmms to stop seti when xmms start and continue seti
when xmms exits. Not very nice but it worked.
Then one day I started mpg123 without stoping seti first. The
problem was gone. What had changed? The kernel version from 
2.2.17 to 2.2.18+VM-global. I don't know if it's 2.2.18 or the 
VM-global patch the made the problem disappear. I never digged
into this.
Try them, I hope it works for you.
