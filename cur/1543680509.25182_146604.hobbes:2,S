For me performance is good.
I don't use it in a RAID configuration but with 4 seperate WD 100GB
HDDs.
Linear througput is 40MB/s (=maximum of this HDD). And when i copy a
file from one of the HDDs to another, the total thoughput is 70MB/s.
I used the same HDDs with a Promise Ultra 100 TX2 before and the
throughput is a bit (i'd say about 5%) better now.

The Highpoint is the only connected device to the 66MHz PCI-Bus.

Real Programmers consider "what you see is what you get" to be just as 
bad a concept in Text Editors as it is in women. No, the Real Programmer
wants a "you asked for it, you got it" text editor -- complicated, 
cryptic, powerful, unforgiving, dangerous.
