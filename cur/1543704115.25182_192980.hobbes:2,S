Seems that way. :)

But can it really not be level triggered? 
My dmesg output tells me explicitly that it switched to level
triggered successfully when APIC is disabled.
So is that message wrong or is there a problem between APIC/ACPI?
Should we not be able to resolve that problem anytime soon, I would
suggest to add some information about this to the Kernel help for both
ACPI and APIC, like:
"
 CAUTION: 
 On some laptops, enabling both local APIC and ACPI can cause
 problems.  Should your system hang during boot with a message like
  'ACPI: IRQ X was Edge Triggered, setting to Level Triggerd'
 you should disable either local APIC (recommended) or ACPI. 
 See 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1774
 for details.
"
that could save people a lot of time in the future hunting down that
bug again -- also it should limit the amount of mails sent around on
the topic. :)
Regards,
Georg
