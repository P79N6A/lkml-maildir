Hmm, it looks like I'll have to do this, in that case:
diff --git a/fs/gfs2/ops_file.c b/fs/gfs2/ops_file.c
index 99d726f..4580335 100644
--- a/fs/gfs2/ops_file.c
+++ b/fs/gfs2/ops_file.c
@@ -743,7 +743,9 @@ const struct file_operations *gfs2_file_fops_nolock = &(const struct file_operat
 	.fsync		= gfs2_fsync,
 	.splice_read	= generic_file_splice_read,
 	.splice_write	= generic_file_splice_write,
+#ifdef CONFIG_FILE_LOCKING
 	.setlease	= generic_setlease,
+#endif /* CONFIG_FILE_LOCKING */
 };
 
 const struct file_operations *gfs2_dir_fops_nolock = &(const struct file_operations){
which is not ideal, but I don't see any easy way to avoid the #ifdef,
Steve.
