Hm, "not ideally" is a real friendly word for describing the mess ;-)
Isn't there a possibility to flag this part of the memory as nonDMA-able, kind
of "do whatever you want with it, but don't expect any dma-driven i/o"...
I know this gets a problem when swap jumps in, though.
But really it is far better for the box to flag it more or less unusable
compared to a DoS done by user-space "find" ...
I know this is a real corner case of life. It looks more like taking a
different decision than current to improve the situation and not so much a real
development topic. Probably a note in kernel docs reading "DON'T DO THIS" is
either sufficient...

Stephan
