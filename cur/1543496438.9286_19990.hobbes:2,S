I've often wondered if it wouldn't be a good idea to do this on Intel
boxes sometimes, especially as many machines routinely have 512MB of
ram, so we could probably get away with merge 4 pages into one and
having pseudo-16k pages.
Presumably this might/will break existing stuff though... I think
many of these could be worked around though.
