Aarrgghh.  Yes, I see your point; it just seems like a shame to tack this
extra set on all cap-enabled binaries just to support your odd C++
cap-enabled.  Since a set is 128 bits, and I hope we never use them all,
maybe we could steal a high-order bit to say raise/lower all effective?

OK, yes... this is only for buffer overflows; still the program _will_
have to be cap-aware to manipulate it's pE properly and avoid other
exploits.

Exactly.  Now ask yourself; if the attacker decides to 'exec /sbin/sh', do
you want pI=(mostly full)=='root shell' or pI=(only what the program
needed)=rather crippled. One useful bit of information from the POSIX
spec: a process cannot raise a bit in the inheritable set that is not
already set in permitted.  So, my extension would allow, in many cases,
pI=pP=(one or two caps) - still dangerous, but much less than before.

Yes, in which case they are constrained to pP.  If pI is full, though,
they are much better exec'ing something that will inherit a lot of power,
like 'cp /etc/shadow /home/ftp/pub/ua412'.  Note I'm not referring to the
uid fs rights, but the capability to read any file which a 'root shell'
would have in pI, and cp might have in fI (so admin can do admin things).
If pI is constrained with a mask, this sort of thing can be mostly
prevented.

But I am, because with pI mostly full, that's where the attacker can gain
priviledge!  I'm trying to say that, if pI is _full_ and a script kiddie
downloads a standard /bin/sh exec'ing buffer overflow exploit, then the
shell they get will be the current equivalent of a root shell!  I'm trying
to avoid that, as well as provide the sysadmin a general means of
constricting the passage of pI.

Read again.  pI is what I was referring to.

I'm just not willing to entertain extensions to prevent a measly DoS
attack (which I grant can be bad, but less catastrophic that root shells)
that adds extra space and calculation overhead for everbody when we
currently can't think of a good example.  And if you _do_ think of one or
two examples, we'll have to decide whether they are general enough to
warrant the extension, or whether the code should just be patched.
