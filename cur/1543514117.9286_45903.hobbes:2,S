Hello,
I was worried about fs corruption so I rebooted quick but, if it gives any
pointers to anyone - on 2.3.23 after a bit of activity (compiling the
kernel) it started swapping and /proc/meminfo showed 2G of swapspace and
generally system became almost unuseable.
So, I reverted back to 2.3.18 which works beautifully (ok, with some minor
tweaks to PCI for the issues which I know Martin already fixed in 2.3.23)
and hope that there are no VFS changes between 2.3.18-2.3.latest so when
things stabilize I will just port my stuff to 2.3.latest=stable...
Regards,
Tigran.
PS. No, I am not a coward - it is just unreasonable to debug a fs
corruption when you don't know whether it is your fs that corrupted it or
some random pagecache/swap cache thingy that has done it... :(
