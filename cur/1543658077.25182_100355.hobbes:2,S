Already drafted the model for secure supporting such a beast.
Additional the day will come when there is mobile internet radio
everywhere with good data rates.  The age of corporate security as it
relates to content on laptops is just over the hill.
No longer will people/corporations need to worry about security of laptops
and that which is stored on them.  Using iSCSI with ACLs, one can shutdown
data access in an instant.  Now this requires or suggests the need for
Diskless Bootable iSCSI without suffering the extra cost associated with,
what is known as "iBOOT" from IBM.  This is another issue, but we (the 
community) have LinBIOS, and I have a full working version of DBiSCSI
today.
Well I will follow up on this later, and yes what you are asking about can
be done.
Cheers,
