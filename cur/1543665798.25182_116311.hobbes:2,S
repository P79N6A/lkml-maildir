I'm wondering about performance in terms of number of system calls.
If I do not completely read from a pipe or socket fd and then decide
to service some other fds (to avoid starvation when one fd is flooded
with data), with LT epoll I will need to issue an extra two
epoll_ctl() system calls.  These are to (a) unregister my interest in
the first fd because it's moved out of my "live" set in userspace,
while I spend a timeslice or so servicing other fdss; (b) reregister
my interest when it is time to reactivate that fd's handler.  These
are not required with ET epoll.
That is a con.
On the other hand, with LT poll I do not have to keep trying to read()
until I see an EAGAIN: I can "pause" a userspace handler when it sees
a short read(), guessing that there is no more data right now.  If
therre actually is more data, I can be confident the event loop will
report it.  With UDP-style fds, I can simply read one packet.  In both
scenarios, LT epoll saves one read() system call.
I am not sure; perhaps there is a similar saving of one accept() call
per event on a listening socket?
This is a pro.
So there you go.  I was about to complain that LT epoll would increase
the number of system calls in some cases, but I correct myself
already.  I think it will decrease the number of system calls on
average due to the removal of extraneous read() and maybe accept() calls.

?? Is this poorly worded?  EPOLLIN and EPOLLOUT are independent events,
aren't they?

Is it not better to (4) select the behaviour when an fd interest is
registered?  I think this is cleanest, if the code is not too
horrible.
Actually I think _this_ is cleanest: A three-way flag per registered
fd interest saying whether to:
	1. Report 0->1 edges for this interest.  (Initial 1 counts as an event).
	2. Continually report 1 levels for this interest.
	3. One-shot, report the first time 1 is noted and unregister.
ET poll is equivalent to 1.  LT poll is equivalent to 2.  dnotify's
one-shot mode is equivalent to 3.
I don't know whether it would make the epoll code messy to do this.  I
suspect it would be quite clean.
