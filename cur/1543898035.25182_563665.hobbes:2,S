  i actually asked about this on either the janitors or newbies list
the other day -- one of the early examples from the LDD3 device
drivers book which built fine all this time suddenly stopped building,
until i explicitly included <linux/sched.h> to be able to dereference
a pointer to "task_struct":
/home/rpjday/AMD/k/topics/0_hi/hi1.c:15: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
/home/rpjday/AMD/k/topics/0_hi/hi1.c:16: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type
  clearly, until now, that header file was being picked up
*somewhere*, but not now.  so i'm guessing there's going to be code
all over the place that suddenly needs to add that inclusion of
sched.h.
