Ok, that said, If we had RT signalling, that would have been a quantum leap.

Usually in the typical application we have (where latency is an issue),
most probably many of the people have a saturated PCI bus. In most
cases, the IPTV guys have such a scenario. Say > 6 or 7 DVB adapters and
the latency goes very high. What i have seen is that when the bus gets
saturated, the CPU usage shoots of rather abnormally. When the latency
goes higher, the resultant stream is useless and packets needs to be
dropped, eventually that results in Transport Stream discontinuities.
Currently we already have a latency issue, based on the loud cries from
some people.
