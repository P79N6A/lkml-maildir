	Hello All,  But I thought I heard some very long time ago
	that the sparc CVS-vger tree was compiling corectly .
	What's been the trouble with Syncing between vger & kernel.org ?
	I just got done yesterday compiling up 2.2.0-pre5 vger-cvs
	on a super sparc 600 mp ie: a vme single board system .
	It has been running quite well since .   JimL
