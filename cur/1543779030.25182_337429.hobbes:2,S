Subject: [patch 10/29] I2C: missing new lines in i2c-core messages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/29/250

From: Jean Delvare <khali@linux-fr.org>
Two log messages lack their trailing new line in i2c-core. I'd swear I had
fixed them already, but it seems not. Bonus: improved coding style.
