Hi and sorry for the late reply. IMHO, this solution is the most concise and still
clear enough a macro to understand what it does after a quick scan (unlike
uglies like IO_COND() in lib/iomap.c¹, :)) And, as a next step, we probably
should do
perl -pi -e 's/DMA_(..)BIT_MASK/DMA_BIT_MASK($1)/g' *
after removing the #define DMA_..BIT_MASK defines in /include/linux/dma-mapping.h
and the other two headers in the original patch after the x86 merge.
Current git (9f34073b4e54ad58541e0e2b4a87f4f6c1460e21) contains about 394
instances of usage of those macros, including the #definitions.
¹ this is not a flame!
