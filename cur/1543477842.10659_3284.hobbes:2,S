 VESA 3.0 Kernel BIOS Support
 ----------------------------
http://pepsi.visus.com/~jmcc/vesa3/
The short story:
	Kernel helper module (like 8390.o). Provides access to 
VESA 3.0 bios services. See the README and vesa3.h for info.
The long story:
	Many moons ago I wanted to use VESA 2.0 services to 
run graphcis cards. Unfortunately (for the Linux kernel) VESA 2.0
didn't support setting graphics modes. Nasty. So, when VESA 3.0
came out with their new protected mode interface, I was quite happy.
	Luke Bishop further got me involved by providing me a pointer
to the VESA 3.0 specs. With a little bit of work and some expert advice
from Luke, I am pround to release Version 0.1 of the Linux VESA 3.0
helper.
	This module _is_not_ a ``full-featured graphics solution'', a la
FBcon, KGI, or X11. All it does it provide the necessary kernel services
such that FBcon (or KGI, or whatever) can call VESA 3.0 functions and
set the graphics mode, palette, get info on a mode, or what have you.
Someone (maybe me ;^) will have to provide the hooks into vesa3.o 
forthose console subsystems.
	Anyway, enough of my chatter. Get the package, try it out, and
drop your jaw in wonder. 
-------------
	Note to kernel hackers: Is there a better way to allocate 
selectors that what I use in my package? (yes, I know that I'm
allocating 2 selectors for every one I return - I want to fix that)

  I can't wait until the point where free Linux CD's or other paraphenalia is 
included in cereal boxes.  That truly will be the cherry ontop of our madness!
