			NO.
GCC already went this way, i.e. it aligns functions and loops by
ridiculous (IMHO) amounts like 16 bytes. That's 7,5 bytes per alignment
on average. Now count lk functions and loops and mourn for lost icache.
Or just disassemble any .o module and read the damn code.
This is the primary reason why people report larger kernels for GCC 3.x
I am damn sure that if you compile with less sadistic alignment
you will get smaller *and* faster kernel.
