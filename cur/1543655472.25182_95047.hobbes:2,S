Subject: [PATCHES] (4/4) stack updates for x86
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

The kernel currently uses an 8k stack, per task.  Here is the
infrastructure needed to allow us to halve that.
D-4k-stack-2.5.50+bk-5.patch
	make a config option to turn on 4k stacks.  (there appears to
	be a problem with this right now).

+	help
+	  This option will shrink the kernel's per-task stack from 8k to
+	  4k.  This will greatly increase your chance of overflowing it.
+	  But, if you use the per-cpu interrupt stacks as well, your chances
+	  go way down.  Also try the CONFIG_X86_STACK_CHECK overflow
