True.  When one or more of these appear at the top (and _only_
the top) of a patch e-mail,
	From:		the person who wrote the patch
        Date:		the date of the authorship
        Subject:	the title of the patch
we override the corresponding values we obtain from the mail
header.  Documenting them is probably a good idea but they
should be described separately from S-o-b: and friends to avoid
confusion.
