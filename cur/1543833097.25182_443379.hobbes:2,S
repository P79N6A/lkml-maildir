Well, _irq would be no good, because we might want to call idr stuff
with interrupts disabled.  But making idr internally _irqsave seems
like the right fix to me.
I think the real issue here is that the sa_query.c stuff wants to use
the idr mechanism to assign "query ids", and other modules want to be
able to start queries from any context.  So if idr uses bare spin_lock
internally, then sa_query.c has no choice but to wrap all idr calls
inside spin_lock_irqsave and do all allocation with GFP_ATOMIC, which
doesn't seem very nice.
