I only have that one ASUS board and there's data on the disks that I do 
not want to loose.
The current patch worked well for me (performance is pretty decent), so 
I went with it.
I can modify the VIA driver code, but looking at the various 
exceptions/quirks for the various VIA chip sets, I'm a bit hesitant to 
test it on my box.
