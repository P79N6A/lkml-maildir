If you consider mainline a technology and distributions your main users,
what is the use of a stable release every months or two months? No
distribution is going to updates its release that often. Looking at the
Debian kernel packages it took at least a month just to get a single
release ready for distro use. Needless to say, Debian (or any other
distro) is not going to go through that for every release.
We already saw that with 2.0, 2.2 and 2.4 kernels: distributions rarely
used the last mainline release but older released with (a sometimes
huge amount of) patches.
So continueing that thought pattern; why not go for something like 6
month release cycles? That seems to fit with a distro release cycles.

same for latitude keyboards after a resume I just discovered :(
