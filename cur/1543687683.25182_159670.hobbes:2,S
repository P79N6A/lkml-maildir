Subject: [PATCH] Fix cdrom error handling in 2.6
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/8/22/218

In both 2.4 and in 2.6, error handling for bad cdrom media is
wrong.  And it is my fault I'm afraid, since I botched an earlier
fix for the problem by putting the fix in the wrong spot.
My kids have a "Jumpstart Toddlers" cd they have long since
completely killed, which makes a great test disc.  Without this
fix, the best time projection I can get for completing a dd type
sector copy is about 2 years...  Most of that is spent thrashing
about in kernel space trying to re-read sectors we already know
are not correctable....  After the fix, I was able to rip a copy
the CD (or rather muddle through it getting lots of EIO errors)
in about 15 minutes.
Attached is the fix for 2.6.x,
 -Erik
