The buffers shouldn't be unmapped.  They are accounted for and doing
the delalloc conversion is easier than really allocating blocks for
truely unmapped blocks.  You should probably reuse BH_Delay for that
as it has all the right handling in buffer.c in place due to XFS.
Also on any filesystem with ->page_mkwrite implemented unmapped buffers
should be entirely gone because we now have the proper early
reservation / allocation infrastructure in place.
