I think the CONFIG_X86_TSC option is most confusing (bad naming, at
best).
Without CONFIG_X86_TSC:
You get the ability to have a TSC or not, both code paths are compiled
in, and it dynamically detects at boot time. You can override this with the
"notsc" option, or overriding the tsc_disable variable, as we did here.
With CONFIG_X86_TSC:
You remove all the code which supports non-TSC systems.
Perhaps I'm just mentally slow, but I think my little brain would find this
area easier of it was called CONFIG_X86_ONLY_TSC or some such.
So if John's patch was rewritten to leave the CPU type switching on
CONFIG_X86_TSC, then have the multiquad switch turn that into 
CONFIG_X86_ONLY_TSC (and change the in code #ifdefs to that)
would that be more palletable? Would make things more readable in
the main code to my mind ....
