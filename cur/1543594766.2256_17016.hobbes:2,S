I'll be more than happy to have IO completion only at socket level.
Something like :
struct iocompletion ioc;
fcntl(sfd, F_SETFL, fcntl(sfd, F_GETFL, 0) | O_NONBLOCK);
ioc.event = IOC_READ;
ioc.callback = data_ready;
ioc.data = session_data;
fcntl(sfd, F_ADDIOC, (long) &ioc);
This would be pretty nice.
