Why generate noise ?
Query bugs.
Find something interesting.
Fix it.
THEN email person (or better yet, add to bugzilla entry).
Flooding the database with "I'm working on this" reports
buys absolutely nothing.

I think you're misunderstanding how things work.
The view you seem to have is to use bugzilla to find bugs,
and get a list of people who to email. This shuts out the
rest of the world who are watching that bug in bugzilla.
If you want to add to a bug reported in bugzilla, forget email,
just _use the tool_.
