 The Linux Test Project test suite <
http://www.linuxtestproject.org
> has
 been released. The latest version of the testsuite contains 2000+ tests
for
 the Linux OS. Our web site also contains other information such as: test
 results, a Linux test tools matrix, an area for keeping up with fixes for
 known blocking problems in the 2.5/2.6 kernel releases, technical papers
 and HowTos on Linux testing, and a code coverage analysis tool.
 Highlights:
 * Updated the test coverage "galaxy map" to include all testcases
   for 32bit Intel and PowerPC architectures.
 * Created a device driver framework tool to allow kernel
   level testing of device driver code.
 * Released first version of the SLES 8 EAL 2+ Certification Test Suite.
 * Made improvements that allow for a quicker overall build and install.
 * Applied more bug fixes, patches, and code cleanups.
 We encourage the community to post results, patches or new tests on our
 mailing list and use the CVS bug tracking facility to report problems that
 you might encounter with the test suite.
