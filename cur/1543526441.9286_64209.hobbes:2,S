The person who ejected the media manually may not be logged in. There is no
way to know who did that - especially when some environments put the host
in one room, and all displays/audio signals in another.

>( by turning the motor on and off , and moving the head around )
ONLY if the media is fully extracted... Partially removed media could
destroy the heads (especially floppys - did that once...) Moving heads
can make it difficult to insert the media too.
