another question - any objections against me rebasing the VP patch to
the current -mm tree and keeping it there exclusively until all possible
merges are done? It would probably quite some work to create a complete
patch for the upstream or BK tree during that process, as small patches
start to flow in the VP => -mm => BK direction. Would any of the regular
VP users/testers be wary to use the -mm tree?
