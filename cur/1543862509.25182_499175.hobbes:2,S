 Update: it doesn't seem to relate to using/not using APIC.
 Last Thursday it twice failed during booting (from cold), with
messages all over the screen.  Again, nothing reached the logs
despite my best attempts.  The second time, I scrolled back to try
to copy it by hand, but there were several sets of messages and I'm
not sure if I'd managed to get to the first of them, or if that had
dropped out.  It seemed to be something to do with highmem (also
noticed highmem in the screen messages the first time).  I tried to
copy it by hand, but it all scrolled out before I'd copied anything
useful as a load of 'atkbd.c Spurious ACK on isa0060/serio' messages
appeared. 
 Today, I've built 2.6.19.2 without highmem (the box only has 1GB,
dunno why I'd included that in the original config) and I will
continue to wait patiently for either a week without problems, or
something that I can manage to note - although I think at the moment
that the second coming of the great prophet Zarquon is more likely.
