Dear linux-smp@vger.rutgers.edu,
As instructed by your code, I'm sending you my /var/log/dmesg file with
some IOAPIC error messages (as an attachment) I'm running a kernel
2.2.16-3smp with dual Pentium III with SuperMicro PIIIDME motherboard.
Please let me know if I can provide any additional information you might
need.
Thanks.
Andrei Mushinski.
