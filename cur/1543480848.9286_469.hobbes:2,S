I've put out an arca-vm-26. The differences between arca-vm-25 and -26 are
that I don't do aging on the swap cache anymore (this should allow
shrink_mmap to decrease the size of the cache at least more easily also on
low memory systems), and a modifyed mem trashing heuristic. It fix also a
potential swap deadlock (triggerable only by the shm memory I think).
The patch can be downloaded from:
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/kernel-patches/2.2.0-pre8testing-arca-VM-26.gz
If you try it please feedback as usual ;). thanks.
