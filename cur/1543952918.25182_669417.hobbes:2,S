When used setpci to tweak the setting, my hdparm -t went
 from 17 to 25MB/s on /dev/hda.
With your patch applied, now after booting it says 33MB/s for
 hda and 37MB/s on hdb (and I can burn DVDs at a stable 6x
 now, while growisofs backed off to 4x in less than a minute
 before the patch).
If the patch does exactly what setpci did, then perhaps I had
 other activity on hda at the moment I ran the test...
