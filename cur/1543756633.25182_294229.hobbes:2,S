The reason pinned pages cannot be unmapped is that if they're being
unmapped while a rawio read is in progress, a cow on some shared
swapcache under I/O could happen.
If a try_to_unmap + COW over a shared swapcache happens during a rawio
read, then the rawio reads will get lost generating data corruption.
I had not much time to check the patch yet, but it's quite complex and
could you explain again how do you prevent a cow to happen while the
rawio is in flight if you don't pin the pte? The PG_locked bitflag
cannot matter at all because the rawio read won't lock the page. What
you have to prevent is the pte to be zeroed out, it must be kept
writeable during the whole I/O. I don't see how you can allow unmapping
without running into COWs later on.
This is the only thing I care to understand really, since it's the only
case that the pte pinning was fixing.
Overall I see nothing wrong in preventing memory removal while rawio is
in flight. rawio cannot be in flight forever (ptrace and core dump as
well should complete eventually). Why can't you simply drop pages from
the freelist one by one until all of them are removed from the freelist?
