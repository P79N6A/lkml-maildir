This is the responsibility of the program. Unless the UDP packet is
bound to a particular address, or the program specifies an IP, the
kernel will pick one. For this reason both the BIND and NTP daemons
open a socket for each interface so they can control this. netstat on
my machine shows:
udp        0      0 192.168.1.225:123       0.0.0.0:*                           
udp        0      0 127.0.0.1:123           0.0.0.0:*                           
udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:123             0.0.0.0:*                        
for the NTP server. The DNS has similar machanism. Remember, UDP
doesn't involve connections, so there is no concept of "replying" to a
packet, the program has to manage that itself.
In your example, if you tell netcat which address to bind to, it will
work.
Hope this helps,
