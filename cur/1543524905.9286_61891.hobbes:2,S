Most cards have rudimentary IP stack functions on them as well. At least
PacketEngines and methings Intel should be able to do the checksumming and a
few other rudimentary ops. 
These are not implemented in the Linux driver (maybe for better ;-).

True. I was simply making a point that the workload to handle GigE is not the
IRQ workload. IRQ workload is handled by design at the hardware level.

Agreed ;-)
There is still a few things that it makes sense for: 802.1Q being the most
noteable example. Overcoming the machine port number limitations and having more
than 10 Ethernet interfaces does make sense. Any chance for it making
mainstream?
