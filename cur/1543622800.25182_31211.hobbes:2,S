Hi.  I was tryhing to get 2.5.6-pre1 working and I tried make
oldconfig with a 2.4.14 .config, but I got the following error:
scripts/Configure: drivers/input/gameport/Config.in: No such file or
directory
When I tried make menuconfig with no .config at all, I got a seg fault
in awk  -- how do I get this working?
Thanks.
