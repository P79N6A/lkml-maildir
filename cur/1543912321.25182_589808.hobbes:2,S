True, but we're lying if we allow a user to set their limit there,
because we can't actually enforce a limit at 8,192 bytes vs 10,000.
They're the same limit as far as the kernel is concerned.
Why not just -EINVAL if the value isn't page-aligned?  There are plenty
of interfaces in the kernel that require userspace to know the page
size, so this shouldn't be too difficult.
