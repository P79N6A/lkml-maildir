No, free RAM is wasted RAM.
You will start wasting RAM once you refuse to free up
pages you just read from swap space for other more
important needs. But that's a general VM problem.
You'll waste IO bandwidth and CPU power to read in pages
that will be evicted unused, but you may get hits and save
page faults. It's just a matter of selecting pages to be preswapped.
But those preswapped pages are either clean and thus immediately
evictable or you were right to preswap them and saved a page fault.
