I know there are more people who want to get rid of NR_IRQS e.g. due to 
very sparse irq distribution. For one of the platforms i'm interested in, 
we have to make a clear distinction between irqs and vectors so that we 
can have seperate vector allocations per interrupt handling domain. I 
believe IA-64 does the same but instead per cpu (our domain/node consists 
of 4 cpus) NR_IRQS gets in the way due to it being set at 224 when we actually 
can service NR_IRQ_VECTORS * NUM_MAXNODES I/O vectors. Can you post your 
patch?
Also what MSI devices are you using?
