yes I expect that it would be a large list in some conditions. but one 
purpose of this API is to make these options able to be discovered by 
software. right now nothing could be done at all without driver specific 
knowledge. even a lengthy list can be better then that.
presenting the list to the user directly is a last resort, only for 
experimentation or when nothing else wants to deal with devices of that 
type.
with a description field (which I didn't include initially, but seems 
obviously needed now) it should be fairly easy to create descriptions that 
let the software see that there are multiple factors involved.

if the driver supports overclocking then list it in the modes (nothing 
says that % capacity couldn't go over 100% for example)

if they power themselves down with no notice to the system they should 
power themselves back up with no need for the rest of the system to tell 
them either. so this ca either be ignored or presented as a mode between 
off and on that enables this behavior.

ahh, here we see a disconnect. I was not intending for the power field to 
be that exact. there are just too many variables. for example: even for a 
cpu, the power used isn't exactly tied to the clock speed and voltage, the 
mix of commands that the cpu is running will affect the power it eats, 
sometimes by a significant amount. it was intended to be an ordering 
factor and approximate the power used so that things could make a 
peroformance/power tradeoff with a good chance of makeing a reasonable 
choice.
it's not intended for 'make this laptop use 24w of power instead of 25w of 
power'

I'll have to look into what the ohm plugin does.....
ok, after a quick google search and reading the wiki, what I was proposing 
would potentially allow ohm to use it directly instead of having to go 
through HAL (there may still be a place for HAL, but some parts of it 
would get significantly simpler if the abstraction was available directly 
from the driver instead of haivng to teach a second piece of software all 
the nuances of the driver for it to then create an abstraction for the 
system to use)

no you don't want to use the same driver for both, however it would be 
very nice to have an interfact that would let yo load the driver for yout 
specialized DSP card and all the opensouce software would see it and be 
able to manipulate it rather then having to modify the HAL, create ohm 
plugins, etc (for how many programs?) before they can know that the card 
is there.
