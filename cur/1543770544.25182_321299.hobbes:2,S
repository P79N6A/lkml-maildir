Comments on the remaining patches in this series:
1) I am not convinced that the subclassing of net_device should be done 
in this manner.  Read drivers/net/wan/hdlc_generic.c and .../pc300_drv.c 
for examples of how hdlc_device is handled.
Comments and thoughts welcome.
2) Please put all the new, protocol-layer functions 
ieee80211_type_trans(), ieee80211_change_mtu(), ieee80211_header(), etc. 
in their own file.
3) Temporary or not, the following construct is simply not necessary. 
Modify the definition rather than repeating this two-call piece of code 
in multiple areas:
	ieee80211_priv(netdev_priv(dev));
4) A low-level wireless hardware driver should look like other net 
drivers, and use the existing driver API.  The low level driver should 
implement its own dev->hard_start_xmit().
  	ieee = netdev_priv(dev);
-	dev->hard_start_xmit = ieee80211_xmit;
-
  	ieee->dev = dev;
+	ieee->priv = ieee80211_priv(ieee);
+	
+	dev->hard_start_xmit = ieee80211_xmit;
Certainly, the driver will make many calls to generic ieee80211_xxx 
functions to get things done.
I understand this was not your change; you simply moved the 
dev->hard_start_xmit() assignment down.  I just wanted to take this 
opportunity to make a point.
5) The wireless code in -mm all sourced directly from my netdev-2.6.git 
tree.  I strongly encourage everyone who wants to work on wireless to 
download git (read 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/5/26/11
) and check out 
branches 'we18' (wireless ex 18), 'we18-ieee80211' (we18 + ieee80211), 
and 'we18-ieee80211-wifi' (we18 + ieee80211 + hostAP) of
