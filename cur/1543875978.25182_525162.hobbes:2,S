Yep, that's a known problem with this driver:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/17/222
This was a known theoretical problem with netconsole from the start
but I'm actually not aware of any other drivers that have run into it.
My preferred fix is to create a netconsole_disable/enable API for
drivers that have this sort of reentrancy problem.
