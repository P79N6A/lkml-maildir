Mercurial is ammenable to rsync provided you devote a read-only
repository to it on the client side. In other words, you rsync from
kernel.org/mercurial/linus to local/linus and then you merge from
local/linus to your own branch. Mercurial's hashing hierarchy is
similar to git's (and Monotone's), so you can sign a single hash of
the tree as well.

I think I can implement a decent repository check similar to git, it's
just not been a priority.
