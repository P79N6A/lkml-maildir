	Erm??? *Their* parents should come into dcache too.

	*All* ancestors, right? How would you recalculate this set on
rename/rmdir/unlink? And besides, it's O(n^2) memory (n - number
of inodes in the game) in the worst case, O(n*depth) in best.

	Erm... You'll need to do it on any lookup. Right now we lock the
parent on each lookup step and release it before the next one. It is not
rename-specific. Locking issues will become very tricky unless you are
going to throttle lookups in the same way it is done with rename. I.e.
single-threaded fs. Welcome back to Minix. Locking is used *not* only for
rename/rename race prevention. Without it you'll get a race in about any
pair of namespace-related operations.
