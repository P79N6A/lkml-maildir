I thought at alpha of course but alpha doesn't provide an hardware
accessed bit in first place :).
my view was too x86-64/x86/alpha centric (incidentally the only archs I
test personally :), I really didn't considered the case of tagged tlb +
accessed bit both provided by the cpu while making that change, so we
hurted ia64 and ppc, but it will be trivial to fix now that Ben promptly
noticed the problem, thanks Ben, good catch, that's really appreciated!
Anwyays this have _nothing_ to do at the very least with stability
unlike the above subliminal messages are implying, see above, it can
only potentially be less responsive under very heavy swap on ia64 and
ppc (dunno sparc64?), period. mentioning real life workloads like Oracle
and RHDB in relation to the tlb flush for the accessed bit is further
subliminal bullshit, Oracle definitely isn't supposed to swap heavily
during the benchmarks, and I'm sure it's not the case for mainline
postrgres either (dunno about RHDB).
