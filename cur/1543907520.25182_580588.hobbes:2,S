this looks unsafe to me, the window is very small, but afaics this can
deadlock if called when nfs4_renew_state() has already started, but didn't
take ->cl_sem yet.
Can't we avoid taking clp->cl_sem here?
Btw, unless I missed something, the code without this patch looks incorrect
too: cancel_delayed_work() can fail if the timer expired, but the ->cl_renewd
didn't run yet. In that case nfs4_renew_state() can run and re-schedule itself
after flush_scheduled_work() returns.
Oleg.
