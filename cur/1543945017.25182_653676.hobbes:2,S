I don't have any EFI boxes.
However with the one bug I found recently (set_memory_uc passed
in bytes for numpages) I doubt it was ever tested in the current
form in tree (perhaps it came from some merge mistake?)

The original motivation for pageattr.c back in 2002 was a very real
problem with AGP cache corruption coming from the direct mapping aliases.
Also while I was still maintaining that code and occasionally broke
it :-] I usually got reports after 1-2 releases from people who were hitting 
real failures from the breakage (given a lot of that was the proprietary Nvidia
driver, but I see no reason it won't hit on completely free software too) 
So from practical experience I beg to disagree.

No you don't see quick crashes left and right from alias attributes,
but subtle cache corruptions after a long time. That is because
it only causes problems when the CPU does some prefetching on
the wrong address and that typically takes some time to happen.
The typical symptom is that at some point (after many hours) 
someone's 3d driver errors out with some internal inconsistency when the 
3d card happened to be feed a corrupted cache line.
But I have no doubts that non 3d workloads will hit it eventually
too (just takes longer because they tend to move much less data)

First before you started rewriting ioremap that all worked correctly[1]
since quite some releases. I fixed this originally long ago
(it was already in 2.6.12; I'm too lazy to search back further) 
So 2.6.25 would be the first kernel since at least 2.6.12 that 
would not do this correctly.
I polititely request that you do something about this regression
for .25.  Either apply my patches or fix it yourself in whatever
way you want. Just fix it.
[1] modulo the relatively minor problem of end_pfn_map sometimes
being a few pages off I recently sent a patch for.

Again 64bit efi_ioremap passes in a fixmap address.
And fixmap is >= the kernel mapping so __pa() will resolve it
to a physical address <= 2GB.
Your 65TB analysis assumed it passed in the vmalloc/ioremap range.
The analysis would be fine for that (although still dubious code).
Unfortunately it had a faulty starting point.
For 32bit it also was wrong I think for the more obscure __PAGE_OFFSET
splits. This is it likely was ok[1] for the default 3:1 but not e.g.
for 1:3.
[1] ok as in not clearly broken; not clean code.

_PCD is PAT!!!! Even if you don't change the PAT MSRs ever setting
_PCD anywhere makes you a PAT user. And ioremap definitely sets
_PCD.

It's not "nice to avoid". It's "if you don't avoid it your cache
will be eventually corrupted". And yes we've had this case 
in the past where it broke real setups.

Ok cpa_check_alias seems to be gone again. That's at least some progress.
And all the __pas are gone too. That's good.
I see you started to follow 
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=120290203315953&w=2
too which is also good although I haven't checked if it's ok
for all cases.
Doing it this way is probably fine for .26 but you still need
a quicker regression fix for .25.
Also it would be nice if someone would apply the remaining CPA
patches I posted earlier this week. Some of them went uncommented
so far and should be not controversal.

Right now first priority should be getting .25 right. This means you 
should fix at least EFI (see my earlier patch today) and
fix the (imho serious) ioremap() alias regression (see other patch) 
EFI is a regression too for 32bit BTW.
Still putting the end_pfn_map fixes into .25 would be nice too, although
they're at least not regression fixes. 
The ioremap patch would be obsolete with the #mm pageattr.c
(assuming you got the alias cases right this time), from the EFI
patch at least the numpages<->size fix is still needed even for #mm
