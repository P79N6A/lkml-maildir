Try Squid; from it's config file:
#  TAG: fake_user_agent
#       If you filter the User-Agent header with 'anonymize_headers' it
#       may cause some Web servers to refuse your request.  Use this to
#       fake one up.  For example:
#
#       fake_user_agent Nutscrape/1.0 (CP/M; 8-bit)
#       (credit to Paul Southworth pauls@etext.org for this one!)
#
#fake_user_agent none
#fake_user_agent Nutscrape/1.0 (CP/M; 8-bit)
