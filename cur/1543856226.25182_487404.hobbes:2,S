great for you, here some details:
 - 2.6.19 was released 29th Nov 2006
 - OpenVZ page shows 2.6.9-023, 2.6.16 and the 
   2.6.18 development
 - Linux-VServer has followed the -rc series
   too, so that's nothing new
 - I didn't manage to find an OpenVZ patch for
   2.6.19 on your site
but probably all the changes from 2.6.19 have
been backported to the stable 2.6.9 kernel
several months ago :)
best,
Herbert
