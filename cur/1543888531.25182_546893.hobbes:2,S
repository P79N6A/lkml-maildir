Subject: [PATCH 000 of 7] md: Introduction EXPLAIN PATCH SET HERE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/20/225

Following are 7 patches for md in current main-line.
The first two fix bugs that can cause data corruption, and so are suitable for -stable. 
The next fixes some problems with hot-adding a device to a linear array.  As has not
been tested by my test-suite until now, it hasn't worked properly until now :-(
The remainder are mainly cleaning up code and comments.  They could
wait for 2.6.23, but are probably safe to go into 2.6.22 (maybe sit a week in -mm??)
Thanks,
NeilBrown
