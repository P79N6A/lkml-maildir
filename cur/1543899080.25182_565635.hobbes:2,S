It'd be nice to see if Valgrind could catch uninitialized
references in the kernel, if only to see if Coverity is
missing anything that happens in practice.
Back in December 2002, Valgrind started to run UML:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=104035199923121&w=2
but it wasn't quite usable, and it seems broken since then.
The last note I could find about this was from Jeff In July 2005:

Has there been any motion since then?
Thanks,
Dan
