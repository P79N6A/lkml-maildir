Hmm - that IMHO is a good thing; I'll have to look at Tux2.

Sure.

Clueless newbies (and slightly less clueless less newbie) type people
don't think that they should HAVE to. My two interests are coping with
particularly pedantic people who don't want there computer to hastle them
about what they should or shouldn't do, and slightly embedded systems
(e.g. set top box/web browsery thing that you want to be able to turn off
like a TV but it should still be able to have a writeable disc for config
and stuff you download/cache etc).

My own opinion here is that I'm only talking about not hurting the system
if you repeatedly pull the plug.   Applications in general should cope
with death gently (in particular never destroying a saved file if they are
killed at an annoying time).
