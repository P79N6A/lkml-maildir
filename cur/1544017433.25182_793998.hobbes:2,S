Subject: 2.6.29-rc2 regression: hibernation hang on eeepc-701 (method  "platform" only)

Hibernation hangs just after writing the image.  With s2disk I can see
this from the console messages.  The same hang happens with kernel
swsusp ('echo disk | sudo tee /sys/power/state'), and I can see that
the image has been written from the HDD led.
In either case, I can still hard-power-off and resume from hibernation.
It doesn't hang if I use the shutdown method (either 'echo shutdown |
sudo tee /sys/power/disk' or  's2disk -P "shutdown method=shutdown"').
Let me know if you'd like more information.
Thanks
Alan
