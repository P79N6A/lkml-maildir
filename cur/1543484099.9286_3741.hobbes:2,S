Ok, I'm replying to my own message on linux-kernel.

I checked it better. It did a 5-6 minutes hang in CPU eating state.
Then it worked.

I was right, and I fixed the problem. Now ksymoops *flies* even on my 486
(the startup is still a little slow, but that's because it sucks up zillion of
data from kernel, modules, etc.)
Here's the patch against linux 2.2.1.
With it, the 5-6 minutes freeze I got on my 486 turned into a 3-4 seconds one.
