This issue is a very very small wart on an otherwise fine idea.
It's really not worth getting bothered by. Truth is, big giant
pathnames break lots of stuff already, both kernel and userspace.
Just look in /proc for some nice juicy kernel breakage:
cwd, exe, fd/*, maps, mounts, mountstats, root, smaps
So, is that a NACK for the /proc filesystem too? :-)
We even limit filenames to 255 chars; just the other day
a Russian guy was complaining that his monstrous filenames
on a vfat filesystem could not be represented in UTF-8 mode.
Both TOMOYO and AppArmor are good ideas. At minimum, one of
them ought to be accepted. My preference would be TOMOYO,
having origins untainted by Novell's Microsoft dealings.
