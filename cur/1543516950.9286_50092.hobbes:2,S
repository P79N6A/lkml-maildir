The spin_unlock is fine agreed. Thanks.
About the _read_ memory barrier (rmb()) it must also prevent _following_
reads to be reordered _before_ the barrier.
read 0x0
rmb(); /* lock on the bus, I was proposing to replace with a write (wrong!) */
read 0x20
The rmb() ensure the "read 0x20" will be executed _after_ "read 0x0".
If I understood well by this thread, a write in the middle of two reads
on IA32 only ensure that the 0x0 is read _before_ the write. But the read
0x20 can happen even before the write and before "read 0x0". This in turn
mean that rmb() can't be implemented with a write in the zero page...
Apologies for the wasted time. Now all is clear to me. Thank you.
Andrea
