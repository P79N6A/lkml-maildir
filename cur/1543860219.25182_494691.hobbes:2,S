Hi,
while writing a netfilter match module I found that, when run,
skb->h.th is not set to the TCP header (it is assured that the packet 
_is_ TCP), as this printk shows me:
skb: h.th=cb5bc4dc nh.iph=cb5bc4dc mac.raw=cb5bc4ce head=cb5bc400 
data=cb5bc4dc tail=cb5bc510 end=cb5bc580
Is it intended that skb->h.th is not set to skb->data + length of ip 
header (skb->data+protoff as far as netfilter matches are concerned)?
