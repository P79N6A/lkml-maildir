The patches seem reasonable.  I queued all three with the intention of
merging #1 and #2 into 2.6.29.  At that stage, architectures can decide
whether or not they want to do this.  I shall then spam Tony with #3 so
you can duke it out with him.
It's a bit regrettable to have different architectures behaving in
different ways.  It would be interesting to toss an x86_64
implementation into the grinder, see if it causes any problems, see if
it produces any tangible benefits.  Then other architectures might
follow.  Or not, depending on the results ;)
