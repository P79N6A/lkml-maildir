Certainly, the testsuite is one the OSDL Hotplug SIG put together last
summer, and consists of several test cases:
   
http://developer.osdl.org/dev/HOTPLUG/planning/hotplug_cpu_test_plan_status.html
   hotplug01:  Check IRQ behavior during cpu hotplug events
   hotplug02:  Check process migration during cpu hotplug events
   hotplug03:  Verify tasks get scheduled on newly onlined cpu's
   hotplug04:  Verify disallowing offlining all CPU's
   hotplug05:  (Unimplemented)
   hotplug06:  Check userspace tools (sar, top) during cpu hotplug events 
   hotplug07:  Stress case doing kernel compile while cpu's are
               hotplugged on and off repeatedly
It can be downloaded here:

We've been running this testsuite fairly continuously for several
months, and irregularly for about a year before that.  We find that on
some platforms like PPC64 it's quite robust, and on others there are
issues, but the developers tend to be quick to provide fixes as the
issues are found.  I'm glad to see that the results are finally showing
green for ia64.

I was also surprised to see this too.  Note that the .config's for the
amd and em64t machines are considerably different (different drivers,
etc.), but the cpu config should be relatively comparable.  Still, I
wouldn't rule out the different behaviors being due to configuration
differences.  We could work on homogenizing the configs of the two
systems if that would help in troubleshooting?
Thanks,
