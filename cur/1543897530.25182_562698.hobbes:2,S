Large boxes unfortunately can't always use vsyscalls...  that's a real
pity. I also had to disable the vsyscalls64 to generate some number.
I think there shall be a perfectly accurate but not monotone mode for
gettimeofday so we can enable rdtscp (via sysctl or/and prctl). Aware
apps can enable the prctl, aware or brave admins can turn on the
sysctl. Vojtech and others should have proper patches to merge for
this.
