Hm, not sure. I was compiling glibc and simultanously running a big
"cvs update" on the nfs server when one of these BUGs happened.
glibc source and the cvs tree live somewhere in /home and /home is
exported rw to a bunch of clients. But no client should have accessed
those two subdirs at that time.

Patch applied and rebooted. The box currently compiles glibc and
firefox in parallel. No problems so far.
Thanks a lot
