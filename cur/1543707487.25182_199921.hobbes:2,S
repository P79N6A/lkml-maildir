I have updated Keith Owens "reference_init.pl" script for
Linux 2.6.  It searches for code that refers to other code
sections that they should not reference, such as init code
calling exit code or v.v.
The script searches all .o (non-MODULE) files in the current
directory and sub-directories.  To restrict its scope, just
'cd drivers/video', e.g., to run it.
Notes:  __devinit and __devexit don't mean/do anything if
CONFIG_HOTPLUG=y, so setting CONFIG_HOTPLUG=n and doing a
'make allyesconfig && make all' finds the most possible
problems.  I say 'possible' because there are probably some
false positives reported.
script for Linux 2.6 is at:
http://developer.osdl.org/rddunlap/scripts/reference_init26.pl
and output from Linux 2.6.3 is at:

Comments/corrections welcome.
