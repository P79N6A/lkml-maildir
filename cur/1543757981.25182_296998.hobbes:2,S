Nick is talking about changing the kenrel so that it "refcounts pagetable
pages".  I'm not sure why.
I assume that this means that each pte page's refcount will be incremented
by one for each instantiated pte.  If so, then /proc/pid/smaps can become a
lot more efficient.  Just add up the page refcounts on all the pte pages -
no need to walk the ptes themselves.
Maybe?
