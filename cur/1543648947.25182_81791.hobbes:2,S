(if ipv4 was made modular) Just reserve the per-cpu statistics space in the 
main kernel when CONFIG_IPV4_MODULE is set. Then you can use it from the module
as needed.

.. and many more data structures that are still cacheline padded too.
(my favourite is in balance_dirty_pages_ratelimit which costs 4K overall
for a single per cpu counter)
