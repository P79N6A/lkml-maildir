Dunno about LVM, I've not plaied a lot with it ...

NFS is a filesystem. However I meant filesystem independent access, ie
raw device access through the network and creating any filesystem on it.
NBD can do this, ENBD is even better, but I think it can be further developed
sure, and at least AFAIK ENBD is not inside the official kernel. Or maybe
it is? :)

In general :) Maybe this is not the question of the kernel nowdays, but that
userspace program. I mean now we can hear news about chaning scheduler
behaviour on-the-fly and other interesing stuffs. I meant these class of
parameters for example. Like the case of the OOM killer and others I know
that implementing a quite complex algorithm inside the kernel is not a good
point, probably. That's why I thought that this kind of on-line "selftuning"
can be possible with a user space process, the only need is to provide
enough statistical parameters and tuning possibilites by the kernel, so the
tuner can do its job. However I don't know that this theory is useful for
reality it was only a wild idea (but sounds good IMHO :)
