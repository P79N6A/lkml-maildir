Thats right. A connection from a different machine always triggers the realtime signal.
On the same machine however, it depends on the user that does the connect and on the
user that creates the listening socket.
While you mention it : Somewhere in net/socket.c there is a connection between SIGIO and SO_NOSPACE.
int sock_wake_async(struct socket *sock, int how)
...
I am trying to follow the code, but it's a little bit difficult for me.
