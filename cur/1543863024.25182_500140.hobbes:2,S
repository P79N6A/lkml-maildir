A simple description would look something like:
- Updated 4-bit IO-APIC physical dest field to 8-bit dest field for
xAPIC; fixes ES7000/ONE kexec timer hang
Is there a changelog file in the kernel for kexec somewhere, or does
this belong in the source file's comments somewhere? I can fix up the
patch as soon as I know where the right spot for the description is. :)
