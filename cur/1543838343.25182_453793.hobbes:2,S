	p = malloc(size);
	free(p);
is good. You don't have to remember "size" which sometimes nontrivially
calculated until free time.
	mmio = ioremap(start, size);
	iounmap(mmio);
is good too for same reasons. Agree so far?
Ergo,
	major = register_chrdev(0, "foo", &foo_fops);
	unregister_chrdev(major);
is good too even if people don't forget to pass the same "foo" in two
places. Luckily, unregister_chrdev() ignores name arg, so passing wrong
won't do any harm.

In kernel, hardly...
$ grep unregister_chrdev -w -n 2.6.18-rc4-mm1
33126:  unregister_chrdev(CPUID_MAJOR, "cpu/cpuid");
35853:  unregister_chrdev(MSR_MAJOR, "cpu/msr");
35861:  unregister_chrdev(MSR_MAJOR, "cpu/msr");
134610:         unregister_chrdev(LP_MAJOR, "lp");
291207:-        unregister_chrdev(hptiop_cdev_major, "hptiop");
352167:+    unregister_chrdev(major_number, "SerialQT_USB");
Two rejects, 4 fuzzy places.

But there is register_CHRDEV_region, unregister_CHRDEV_region,
alloc_CHRDEV_region, register_CHRDEV. Should I change the spelling of
register_chrdev() for a good measure, too?
