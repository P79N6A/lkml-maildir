Hi Christoph,
you know I've read UDF sources. As I understand all UDF_I_ macroses
could be converted without breaking UDF state but... as you exactly
mentoined it's style is horrible and I'm thinking about rewritting the
whole UDF system. Unfortunelly I'm not _mature_ kernel developer (I'm kernel
newbie) and it could take a long time for this (I think something like
~ 3 month or more ;). Actually I'm ready to spend my free time for
this. So how do you think could it be reasonable?
