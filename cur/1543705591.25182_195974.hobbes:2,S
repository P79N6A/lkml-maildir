Hi.
Are you using a swap partition or swap file? If we're talking swap file,
I would suspect suspend2. I haven't had a chance to look yet (preparing
to move to Aussie), but Michael has told me there are problems with the
swapfile support.
If you had a crash while using suspend and swap file support, I wouldn't
be totally surprised to see an emergency sync causing this. That said,
the code has a number of safety nets aimed at stopping us syncing while
suspend is running, to avoid precisely this sort of corruption. If it
was suspend, I'd expect your superblock to have been messed too. Did
that happen?
Regards,
Nigel
