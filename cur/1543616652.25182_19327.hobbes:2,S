Maybe I got the wrong person - if so I apologise.

I think you'll find it a lot easier to follow too. The thing to watch is
that the queue of devices to process on an IRQ is not per host but driver
global. The rest should be obvious, but watch the co-routine locking. If
you get that wrong the driver does occasionally recurse down the stack and
explode mysteriously.
