I'm not sure how you conclude that Theo missed the relevant parts --
there were many messages posted to misc@openbsd.org mailing list and
to The OpenBSD Journal in the last few days, and to me it appears as
all of the problems were discussed ad nauseam.
After the obvious copyright violations were addressed, I think the
problem started being an ethical one.
As a free software user and developer, the question I have is how come
the Linux community feels that they can take the BSD code that was
reverse-engineered at OpenBSD, and put a more restrictive licence onto
it, such that there will be no possibility of the changes going back
to OpenBSD, given that the main work on the code has happened at
OpenBSD? (Obviously, such a scenario it is permitted by the licence,
but my question is an ethical one -- after all, most components of
OpenHAL were specifically based on the OpenBSD's ath(4) HAL code.)
You can see that Christoph Hellwig agrees with this ethical problem,
as in the message below.
