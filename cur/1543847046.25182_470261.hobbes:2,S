*Waving hallo again*
After partially solving one problem another occurs...

with additional patch tp_smapi 0.30 
I can suspend exactly twice. will say, after second wakeup I don't get 
any ACPI events. I already searched for error messages in the logs and 
found this:
Oct  6 08:49:09 gimli kernel: [45058.156000] ACPI Exception (evxface-0545):
AE_BAD_PARAMETER, Removing notify handler [20060707]
it occurs on unloading ibm_acpi module after resume
reloading ibm_acpi dosen't change anything
one message that is in the log for the first suspend/resume but not in the
second is 
- Breaking affinity for irq 219
and in the second I see this, which I guess has nothing to do with my
problem...
