Before there was a sched_yield(), many programs were written to
give up the CPU for a bit by executing sleep(0). Whether or not
this is "good/bad/etc" is moot. Changing sleep to return immediately
without first scheduling, will cause such programs to eat up a
lot of CPU time, slowing other tasks down.
Look at `top` while executing:
	for(;;)
            ;
Then look at it with:
	for(;;)
            sleep(0);
Then decide if you want tp break sleep().
Cheers,
