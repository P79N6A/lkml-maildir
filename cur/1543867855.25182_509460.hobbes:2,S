Yep, pretty much.  They're all generally to do with Xen's virtual device
model, and are needed by modular frontend/backed drivers.  This series
only includes the basic block and network frontend devices, but there
are more waiting in the wings.
The breakdown, roughly, is:
    * event channel management
    * pseudophysical <-> machine addresses
    * grant-table management
    * xenbus, which includes
          o which has a filesystem-like namespace
          o the means to monitor changes in objects in the namespace
          o shared resource management
          o suspend/resume
