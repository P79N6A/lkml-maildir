hi all
I did this lately:
# dd if=/dev/cdrom of=cd1.iso
# mount -o loop -o ro cd1.iso /iso/cd1
added the /iso dir in /etc/exports and restarted nfs.
When accessing this dir from an nfs client, I can see anything except
what's from the loopback mounted system.
Please cc: to me as I'm not on the list.
