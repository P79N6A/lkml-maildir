Hi!
I know this may be stupid, but...
I'm backing up my linux kernel trees, and found out that backup (done
by rsync) is twice as big as original. That's quite bad... it is
because git uses hardlinks heavily but rsync can't preserve them.
I'm pretty sure someone hit this before... what is the trick?
