signal() is crap... I personally think it was a major lose to have
signal() change to BSD behaviour by default (an unexpected change for
most applications!!)
For sigaction() you must choose behaviour explicitly anyway, by either
specifying or not specifying SA_RESTART.
Applications should use sigaction().  Period.  Full stop.  signal() is
so unpredictable these days as to be practically unusable.
