Yes, that was perfect, thanks a lot. Unfortunately, I do not see a lot
of interesting things. The last write before the disconnect is a FAT
update:

Only one cluster was taken, when compared with the FAT that was read.
Everything seems to be in order. But the next trace (after replug -
see the device number changing from 6 to 7) shows FAT with old contents
being read (same block number 0x30):

So, the device replies that writes were successful, but does not
actually commit them to the stable storage.
I suspect that this device may require some delays. I seem to recall
that we added delayes to usb-storage when we worked with Genesys
Logic. But ub contains no delays.
How about this:

Please try this patchlet and let us know how it went.
