Agreed.  
One could probably get a false negative, but it's hard to imagine a
sensible usage example.  I just like to be tidy any time concurrency
issues arise.

Quite right, good eye.  :-)
I must not have tested that combination.  :-(

Good.  I thought about that, too.

I am willing to do that if the kernel developers think it better.  
It recently occurred to me that jackstart might be able to detect this
situation and exec jackd, anyway.  (AFAICT, the only reasonably
POSIX-compliant method for detecting that a process has the
"appropriate permission" to do something is trying it to see whether
it returns EPERM.)
Thanks for helping...
