Hi Ralf,
CONFIG_PMC_MSP is defined in the main platform patch (arch/mips/Kconfig). I doesn't apply against the git HEAD yet. I'm still working on it and will post as soon as it does.
msp_regs.h defines the UART0_STATUS_REG and UART1_STATUS_REG SoC addresses for the DesignWare UART. I thought of putting them in include/linux/serial_reg.h but it contains register offsets only, no platform addresses.
That is one of the main issues, how to add MSP71xx specific register mapping without platform tests/includes?
