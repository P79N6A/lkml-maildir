Hello,
I've been getting some messages like this:
Jan 11 15:14:16 router kernel: protocol 0008 is buggy, dev comx0
Jan 11 15:14:26 router kernel: protocol 0008 is buggy, dev comx0
Jan 11 15:14:29 router kernel: protocol 0008 is buggy, dev comx0
Jan 11 15:14:36 router kernel: protocol 0008 is buggy, dev comx0
Jan 11 15:14:39 router kernel: protocol 0008 is buggy, dev comx0
the other end of this link is a cisco router... on this router though, the
link works... there is another router which is connected to a 3com router,
prints these messages all the time and even the protocol negotiation
fails. Any ideas what could cause this? Who is supposed to handle the nh
member of the sk_buff ?

     It's practically impossible to look at a penguin and feel angry.
