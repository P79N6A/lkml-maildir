I see and agree, in this case my patch will create more problems.. Actually the 
problem here is _not_ that the directory is removed even though it is in use. 
The inherent dentry ref. counting should take care for that and 
corresponding dentry will be around as long as there are existing users. The 
problem here is parent going away before child and we are trying to remove the 
child directory more than once.

The only problem with Mike's fix is that it fixes the symptom and does
not fix the real cause. I don't see in which case we can have a NULL
d_inode at that point, checking for that means hiding the real problem.
Probably dump_stack() in sysfs_remove_dir() could bring more light in this 
problem.
