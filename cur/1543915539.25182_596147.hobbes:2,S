Yes, after a "make mrproper" it compiles fine.
However, the .config is gone afterwards ...

Well, on this line it may be nice to be able to put the target architecture 
somewhere ...
	make mrproper
	make menuconfig ARCH=um
	make ARCH=um
... some tweaking
	make menuconfig
and the .config is overwritten with the "wrong" architecture.
(I know about .config.bak and so on ... just a small wish)
Thank you!
