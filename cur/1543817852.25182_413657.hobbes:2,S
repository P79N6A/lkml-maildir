I think this cleanup patch is even going in the wrong direction.  The
subarch code right now is a real pain because it is never clear when
you are calling a function with multiple definitions.  Which makes it
really easy to break.
If we are going to refactor this can we please move in the direction
of a machine vector like alpha, ppc, and arm.  I don't see the current
this cleanup making it any easier to tell there is code in a subarch.
