Don't be silly. You can't use JFS in case-insensitive mode and do anything 
sane.
That will terminally confuse a lot of UNIX applications, including NFS
serving.  Which makes the whole thing completely useless _except_ as a
pure Windows-compatible partition.
If you are going to limit a partition to _only_ doing Samba serving, then 
you have no problems _anyway_, since then samba can do all locking and all 
name translation totally on its own.
In short, a case-insensitive filesystem is fundamentally uninteresting. It 
buys _nothing_ that samba can't do already, since it only means that you 
can't really do anything else on it.
