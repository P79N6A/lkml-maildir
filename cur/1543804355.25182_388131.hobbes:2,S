Subject: [PATCH 3/5] DMI: only ioremap stuff we actually need
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/19/275

dmi_scan_machine() tries to ioremap 0x10000 (64K) bytes, even though
it only looks at the first 32 bytes or so.  If the SMBIOS table is
near the end of a memory region, the ioremap() may fail when it
shouldn't.
This is in the efi_enabled path, so it really only affects ia64 at
the moment.
