Sounds fragile to begin with. But you're right in that that is valid
for Linux as you know it. However in -rt most/all spinlocks are
converted to sleeping locks. In that case sync_sched() is not enough.
So I'd rather recommend against proliferation of such schemes, as we'd
have to clean them up later on.
Still, I'm sure there are other false positives and we need to come up
with proper annotations for those.
