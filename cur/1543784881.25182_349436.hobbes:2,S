The 2GB limit is to deal with allocation of hardware command frames
(FIB) and thus only during initialization, all the adapters deliver DMA
to the full address range at 'run time' and the driver does open the
limit up at that point. The reason for this strangeness is the inability
of the Firmware to work around the Intel ATU when doing memcpy, where
the DMA engine had no such limits.

Oh really? I have throngs (a technical term) of customers that would
bear witness otherwise.

Patently false. The cards with the 2GB limits (2200S) are popular
sellers in the channel, the replacement (2230S) w/o the limit is ramping
though ...

The current sources do handle it, took nearly a year for the patches to
propagate from the scsi-list. Meanwhile I deliver a driver to all the
customers that experienced problems, while I waited ...
