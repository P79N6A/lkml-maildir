This is indeed an accident waiting to happen -- someone is bound to
replace the "|" with an "||", a change that is too easy for someone
to miss.  Once Vatsa is satisfied with the CPU-hotplug aspects of
this set of patches, if __rcu_pending() still has side-effects, I would
suggest something like the following:
	int rcu_pending(int cpu)
	{
		int retval = 0;
		if (__rcu_pending(&rcu_ctrlblk, &per_cpu(rcu_data, cpu)))
			retval = 1;
 		if (__rcu_pending(&rcu_bh_ctrlblk, &per_cpu(rcu_bh_data, cpu)))
			retval = 1;
		return retval;
	}
A few more lines, but the intent is much more clear.  And I bet that
gcc generates reasonable code in either case.
Or maybe this is just me...
