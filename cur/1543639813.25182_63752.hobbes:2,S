If you have a human to do a little of the work, you can build filters to
do a three category triage; pass, fail, and human review. This allows
the filters to be be MUCH tighter, but assumes 7*24 moderation of some
sort.
Not a recommendation, just a thought. I have this set up on lists and
posting hosts, and it works reasonably well, taking about five minutes a
few times a day on the weekend.
