Very Brief Documentation:
You can select a default scheduler at kernel build time.  If you wish to
boot with a scheduler other than the default it can be selected at boot
time by adding:
cpusched=<scheduler>
to the boot command line where <scheduler> is one of: ingosched,
nicksched, staircase, spa_no_frills, spa_ws or zaphod.  If you don't
change the default when you build the kernel the default scheduler will
be ingosched (which is the normal scheduler).
The scheduler in force on a running system can be determined by the
contents of:
/proc/scheduler
Control parameters for the scheduler can be read/set via files in:
/sys/cpusched/<scheduler>/
