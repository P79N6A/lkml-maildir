I just booted the machine 4 times - 3 warm boots and 1 cold boot. No problems:
mark@lightning ~ $ uname -a
Linux lightning 2.6.17-rt8 #1 PREEMPT Wed Aug 2 16:49:42 PDT 2006
x86_64 AMD Athlon(tm) 64 Processor 3000+ GNU/Linux
mark@lightning ~ $
I'll keep the camera handy and see if I can get some info if it happens again.
