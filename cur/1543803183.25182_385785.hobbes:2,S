I tried -git8 last night.
make all modules_install install gave me again this error:
if [ -r System.map -a -x /sbin/depmod ]; then /sbin/depmod -ae -F System.map  
2.6.15-git8; fi
WARNING: Couldn't open directory /lib/modules/2.6.15-git8: No such file or 
directory
FATAL: Could not open /lib/modules/2.6.15-git8/modules.dep.temp for writing: 
No such file or directory
make: *** [_modinst_post] Fehler 1

I had to pull the plug, because the reset switch did not work.
I will try the nexft git version this night, but I have to wait some more 
hours.
Glück Auf
Volker
