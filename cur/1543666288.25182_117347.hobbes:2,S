No.
Because, in order to properly export data, you have to not understand
the BK file format, but you also have precisely follow BK's method
for creating the "weave" of changesets which produces a valid [GNU
patch / changeset / whatever].
Thus, even to have an open source BK export tool requires that key
BK algorithms be open sourced.
