I see your point, but isn't EOI the chip specific implementation of
chip->ack() in that case ? 
The intention was to get down to the chip primitives and away from the
flow type chip->functions. Your patch would actually force the flow
control part (if (!(desc->status & IRQ_DISABLED))) back into the end()
function for Ingo's x86 implementation. So the intended seperation of
low level chip functions and flow control would be moot.
