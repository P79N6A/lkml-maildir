I had previously reported DMA problems with ultraDMA using
Serverworks OSB4 (LE) chipset talking to IDE drives including
Western Digital and Seagate.
I am now running 2.4.9-0.18 kernel as found at Redhat's Rawhide
which includes Alan's latest diagnostic patches, and am getting
the message like this:
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:01 (hdc), sector 2487128
Curious - OSB4 thinks the DMA is still running.
OSB4 wait exit.
hdc: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: dma_intr: error=0x40 { UncorrectableError }, LBAsect=2487198,
sector=2487128
------------------------
with the "Curious..." patch being the new diagnostics added by Alan.
All the various failure modes which we see include this error
message now.
What does this imply...is there any hope for a fix?
