That's the primary reason - this idiom is also used by at least the
clock API and possibly other things.  It also allows us to do things
like show which devices are supplied by which regulators in sysfs.

That's doable at the cost of the diagnostic info but...

...as you say it's a bit tricky to use right now.  I haven't checked but
I expect that the platform data that you can supply in the i2c board info
would work as a token, though it's far from ideal and there may be no
other need for platform data.
As a temporary workaround note that the regulator API allows the device
to be NULL at the minute, though there is a desire to remove that
option.  Providing your regulators have unique names you will be able to
pass the supply name in as platform data and use that only.  This usage
is not encouraged and will hopefully become invalid over time, it's
there at the minute mainly because we don't have a good idea what to use
for the struct device for cpufreq drivers.

It'd be nice to be able to access the struct device for i2c devices more
readily at registration time.  Like I say, it's not a regulator specific
issue so it'd be good to come up with a general solution.
