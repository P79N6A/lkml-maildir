I don't know if Stephan filed the report as you requested, but I have tried to 
independantly confirm this regression on a TR-DLSR server I have here, but 
unfortunately neither 2.4.23 or 2.4.24 will boot from the Mylex 170 Raid card 
(DAC960) with ACPI enabled, so I never get to lspci :(
I could perhaps capture the boot messages over serial port, if that would be 
helpful?
