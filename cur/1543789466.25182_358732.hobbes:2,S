In our making IA64 machine node 0 might not have any low-memory, and
another node can have low-memory instead.
This cause comes from hotplug whole of one node.
For example, please imagine following case.
1) In this case, firmware remembers pxm 1's node has low memory.
                 node 0             node 1 
               +--------------+  +-----------+
               |  pxm = 1     |  | pxm = 2   |
               |  low memory  |  |           |
               +--------------+  +-----------+
2) If one node is hot-added at pxm = 0 (pxm is decided from physical
   locate by firmware.), new node will be node 2.
  node 2          node 0          node 1 
+-----------+  +--------------+  +-----------+
| pxm = 0   |  |  pxm = 1     |  | pxm = 2   |
|           |  |  low memory  |  |           |
+-----------+  +--------------+  +-----------+
3) If user reboots the machine, Linux decides node id from pxm's order.
   But firmware still remembers which node has low memory.
   So, node 0 will not have any low memory.
  node 0          node 1          node 2
+-----------+  +--------------+  +-----------+
| pxm = 0   |  |  pxm = 1     |  | pxm = 2   |
|           |  |  low memory  |  |           |
+-----------+  +--------------+  +-----------+
So, just "use NODE(0)" is not enough hack for our machine.
If "use NODE(0)" is selected, kernel must sort pgdat link and
node id by memory address. I think that hot add code will be a 
bit messy instead.
Thanks.
