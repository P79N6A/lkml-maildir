Yep.. atomic_t static variables used as counters are a perfect match:
they are updated very often and read rarely. Therefore, it is
preferable to have per cpu updates with very cheap locking and to
iterate on all of them to sum them when they should be printed. That's
just an example, but with it comes vmstat and all sorts of counters.

Each of these cmpxchg will execute atomically wrt the local CPU, so
there is no limitation there.
