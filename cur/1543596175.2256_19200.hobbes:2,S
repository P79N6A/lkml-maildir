Fully agreed, but there is one problem with this idea.
Suppose you have a maximum of 20% of your RAM for these
"one-shot" things, now how are you going to be able to
page in an application with a working set of, say, 25%
the size of RAM ?
If you don't have any special measures, the pages from
this "new" application will always be treated as one-shot
pages and the process will never be able to be cached in
memory completely...
