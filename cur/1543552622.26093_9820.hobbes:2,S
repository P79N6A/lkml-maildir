Really strange, I'm getting exactly the same problem on a machine
with the same chipset...
This is an athlon 750 machine, with scsi and ide a disk...
I've tryed to see where the problem was comming from for age
( the problem is what you describe and it happen after some time 
  (1 to 24 hour, it depend) and often while or after heavy I/O...
   the only fix is to reboot the machine. )

I've changed my motherboard thinking it was a default of it.
it is not.

I've this kind of motherboard without audio.

I'll try it ASAP, then do a feedback.

I worry about my child and the Internet all the time, even though she's too 
young to have logged on yet. Here's what I worry about. I worry that 10 or 15 
years from now, she will come to me and say 'Daddy, where were you when they 
took freedom of the press away from the Internet?'  -- Mike Godwin
