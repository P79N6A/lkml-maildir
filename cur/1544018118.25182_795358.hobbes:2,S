Can you give a more concrete example of how the current code can break?

This is a fairly fundamental change to the way that mems_allowed is
handled - it dates back to fairly early in cpusets' history.

This comment is no longer true, since mems_allowed is now being
updated by other processes.
What's to stop a task reading current->mems_allowed and racing with an
update from update_tasks_nodemask() ? Or else, why can that not lead
to badness?
