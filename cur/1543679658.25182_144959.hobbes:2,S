I was describing munlock(); munmap() would do the same except not even
bother trying to allocate the pte_chains and always unmap it from the
processes whose mappings are being fiddled with.

We have the information because I'm describing this as part of doing a
pagetable walk over the mlock()'d area we're munlock()'ing.

That doesn't matter; it only has to have an entry in swapper_space's
radix tree. But this actually could mean trouble since things currently
assume swap is preallocated for each entry in swapper_space's page_tree.
Which is fine; just revert to the old chaining semantics for mlock()'d
pages with PG_anon high.

This algorithm occurs during a pagetable walk of the process we'd unmap
it from; we don't unmap it from all processes, just the current one, and
allow it to take minor faults.
