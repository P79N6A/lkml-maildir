Here's a patch to just correct the comment. The md usage is safe because
it switches ->make_request_fn before syncing the queue and on second
thought it is a bit silly to add freeze/unfreeze functionality that no
one will use right now anyways. Alternatively, we could add this
functionality to the core so the interface would be
	/* callers wait for unfreeze */
	blk_freeze_queue(q, FREEZE_WAIT);
or
	/* callers are io errored immediately */
	blk_freeze_queue(q, FREEZE_END_IO);
which would work for both. I'll keep it in mind if such a use becomes
attractive, for now I think we should just correct the comment.
