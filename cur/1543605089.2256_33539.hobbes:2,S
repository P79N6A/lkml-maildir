Ok I switch ON the light in my brain and things are better now.
The PCI layer notify the driver that one of its devices has been
removed.
This is done with the remove function in the pci_driver struct.
In the case of the aic7xxx this is the function
ahc_linux_pci_dev_remove().
I should, at this point, precise that I use the driver v6.2.4.
I look in the code but it looks like this part of the code is broken.
Please Justin let me 1 month before starting looking at it. Otherwise I
have no chance to find a bug by myself.
