The _only_ VFS change involved in the 2.3.x reiserfs port is this:
-                       sb->s_op->read_inode(inode);
+                       
+                       /* reiserfs specific hack right here.  We don't

+                       if (sb->s_op->read_inode2) {
+                               sb->s_op->read_inode2(inode, opaque) ;
+                       } else {
+                               sb->s_op->read_inode(inode);
+                       }

That's not nice indeed but it's also obviously safe and non very
intrusive. It's definitely _not_ the "worst thing one can do to the VFS"
IMHO :).
