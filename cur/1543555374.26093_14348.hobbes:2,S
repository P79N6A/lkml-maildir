You may want to try using raw I/O to fully characterize the behavior
of you device.  I found that when I use raw I/O I could get very good
performance characteristics for devices.  If you use dd with a raw
device you can vary the block size to see what kind of performance you
get out of different sizes.  This will completely bypass any affects
of buffer cache to get you the performance of the disk in question.
An example of this would be to run this sequence of commands noting
the time it takes to run it (all transfers 100MB):
	time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/raw1 bs=512 count=204800
	time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/raw1 bs=1k  count=102400
	time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/raw1 bs=4k  count=25600
	...
The standard Stephen Tweedie raw I/O will do up to 64KB chunks, beyond
that you'll probably have to write one specific to your device (SGI
has one for SCSI which I've gotten up to 1MB reads/writes).  Using dd
doesn't necessarily show you your performance as most access patterns
will not be completely sequential in nature, but you can figure out
what your "sweet spot" is for your block size.
