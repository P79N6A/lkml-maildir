Right.  And I agree 100% that we need to respect that ABI.
Long-term, though, we need to think about a saner home for sysctl's than
procfs.  hch's suggestion of giving them their own filesystem is a good
idea to start with.
Right now, though, I think it is a shining exemplar of sanity to
associate device-related attributes with the device's directory in
sysfs.
