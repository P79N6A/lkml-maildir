What about GPL modules that don't want to get merged ? I don't know any
such module that could use this API. But at least there are some webcam
drivers that don't seem to want to be merged (I don't know why).
I agree with making life hard for proprietary modules. I agree that
maintaining a stable API is hard. But I don't see the actual point of
discouraging modules to stay out of tree.
