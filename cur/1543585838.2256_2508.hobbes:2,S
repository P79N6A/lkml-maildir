The immediate affect of specifically targeting Linux is to cause
"security administrators" to deny network access to all Linux
machines.
I have just received notice that my machines will no longer be
provided access to "The Internet".
"Effective on or before 16:00:00 local time, the only personal
computers that will be allowed Internet access are those administered
by a Microsoft Certified Network Administrator. This means that
no Unix or Linux machines will be provided access beyond the local
area network. If you require Internet access, the company will
provide a PC which runs a secure operating system such as Microsoft
Windows, or Windows/NT. Insecure operating systems like Linux must
be removed from company owned computers before the end of this week....."
