Hmm. sys_call_table is gone? That's sad.
How about a
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL_AND_DONT_EVEN_THINK_ABOUT_SENDING_A_BUG_REPORT(sys_call_table);
and displaying a nasty warning message on the console whenever a
module used it?
It is rare that I need to use it, but when I do I need it bad, for instance: 
fsync on large files used to have severe performance problems, I was
able to just change sys_fsync to be a call to sys_sync without
rebooting or even restarting the database(Solid) before the problem
got out of hand.
A server for an online internet game had several months of uptime and
I needed to rotate the log-files so I made a module which trapped
sys_write and closed and reopened the file with a new name before
continuing[1]. 
Even if it is discouraged for normal use it is a very nice thing to
have to fix up various surprises.
I know I can still use the Phrack technique, but somehow I am not
convinced that I can rely on it being available.

This did not work back then however.
