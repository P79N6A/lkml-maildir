I once struggled with similar problems when using an eepro100 in an 2.2.x
SMP system.
I was getting heavy (>10%) packet loss on that interface, but I tracked the
problem down to be something between the eepro100 and that cheap
(Lantronix) 10mbit switch i was using... 
Attached to a 3com 10/100 switch, I wasn't getting any packet loss at all
with the eepro100.
This was definitely _not_ a speed-autosensing failure, I set the card
manually to all possible speeds / duplex values...
Another funny thing about this Lantronix "switch" was that it was causing
collisions as well (how on earth is that possible on a switch?)
I ended up upgrading that switch with a 3com 10/100mbit autosensing switch
and everything is working just fine.
