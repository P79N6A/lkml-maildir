A few small fixes since -rc3, most notably an OHCI bug that would corrupt
memory and seems to have been the reason for the "Bad page flags" bug at
least on ppc64 (it's not been reported on x86, as far as I know, but I
don't see why the corruption couldn't have happened there too).
The full changelog from 2.6.3 is on the ftp-sites along with the patches
and tar-balls, and the BK trees have been updated.
