Subject: [PATCH 2 of 2] Add faster __iowrite32_copy routine for x86_64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/12/178

This assembly version is measurably faster than the generic version
in lib/iomap_copy.c.
