Wrong.  The _only_ supported method so far has been surprise removal. 
 For years now.  This happens every day in the land of CardBus, which 
was the first "PCI" hotplug implementation in the Linux kernel.  PCI 
HotPlug introduces a new, non-surprise removal.
Thus, the current model should be assumed to be surprise removal, and 
you need an additional notification from the system if a "nice" removal 
is about to occur.

PCI is electrically safe.  Reads to non-existent areas return 
0xffffffff, etc.  Take a look at net drivers some day, we have been 
handling this for years.
Surprise removal is actually easier from many perspectives -- you don't 
have to worry about quiescing the hardware, you simply have to error out 
all I/Os, and clean up the kernel structures that are left behind (host 
info, device info, etc.).  The non-surprise removal is more annoying, in 
that you could potentially have an indefinite wait (and must actively 
avoid such a situation) while shutting down the hardware, completing 
I/Os, etc.
