Sounds like a bad idea.
(i) The function exists already and lives in user space - hwclock.
(ii) This would add a very large amount of bloat without any
increase in functionality.
(iia) This would add a maintenance duty to update kernel data
each time some political body takes a decision about when DST starts, etc.
I hope you realize that libc uses /etc/localtime which points at
some file in /usr/share/zoneinfo or so, and since one cannot access
such files from the kernel, they would have to be compiled into the kernel.
Even if a configuration option selects the part you need, this would
still add more than a megabyte to the kernel source.
