Yes, it is.  Though it doesn't actually make any material difference to 
my argument.

0x4bccef00 is positive. The correct number is 0xc1000000-0xc0431100 = 
0xbcef00
The %gs:per_cpu__foo addressing mode still calculates 
0xbcef00+0xc0433800, which is still a subtraction.  My essential point 
is that *all* kernel addresses (=kernel symbols) are negative, so using 
them as an offset from a segment base (any segment base) is a 
subtraction, which requires a 4G limit.
