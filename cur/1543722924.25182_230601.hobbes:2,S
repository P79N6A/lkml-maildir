You see what is happening. Pete writes simple straightforward correct
code.  You want to replace it by ugly code that is perhaps not 100%
correct.  Then the ugliness spreads - not only a local cast, but
globally the data structures must be adapted. And would it help? What
padding do you get in that union? Do the details depend on the gcc
version? On the compilation flags?
Always write simple direct obvious code. Avoid all casts.
Uglifying code burdens maintenance. It endangers correctness.
It is reasonable only when efficiency is really important,
when every nanosecond counts (and the ugly code is really faster).
That is not the case here.
