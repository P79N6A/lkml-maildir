James, this patch is wrong.
A SCSI LUN is not "u64 lun", it has never been and it will
never be.
A SCSI LUN is "u8 LUN[8]" -- it is this from the Application
Layer down to the _transport layer_ (if you cared to look at
_any_ LL transport).
(It is also capitalized since it is an abbreviation.)
To compare/print it, please use, as shown at the top of the
file "sas.h":
(be64_to_cpu(*(__be64 *)(_x)))
where _x is only the "LUN" of the definition above.
If you want to print it, please use "%016llx".
It also appears that you've never compiled your patch on
x86_64.
Alternatively, you can take a look at the SAS Layer.
