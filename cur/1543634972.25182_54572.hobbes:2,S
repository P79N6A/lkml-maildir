And that is almost always the case anyways, since most cases traverse a 
linked list that must already be protected.  You are trying to 
overengineer a solution to a simple, but subtle, problem.
PS.  If you really want to make the broken cases show themselves, poison 
the module memory when it is unloaded.  The same can be done for dumping 
init data and text.
