Moving the original to make a backup is a _bad_ thing if the original
might be hard-linked and you'd like all instances to be written to.
OTOH it'a a good thing if you're using hard links for poor man's version
control (`cp -rl').  Hey :)
Emacs does this perfectly with `backup-by-copying-when-linked' (an
option you can change, but I like it on).
