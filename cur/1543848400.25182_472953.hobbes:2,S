Subject: [PATCH] get_user_pages(..., write==1, ...) may return with readable pte.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Handle the case in get_user_pages() when a call to __handle_mm_fault()
inserts a writable pte, and a process doing dup_mmap converts it
to readable before get_user_pages() does the subsequent request to
follow_page().

Hugh, Nick, and Linus,
I think I have tripped over another flavor of a get_user_pages bug
we addressed back in 2005.  I do not have a test case to prove it is
the issue I am trying to address, but I have done as thorough a code
walk-through as I can.
Assume a pte is currently empty.  A first pthread is in the kernel on
a call path which is leading to get_user_pages.  A second pthread is
in the process of doing a fork.  The process doing get_user_pages()
gets into __handle_mm_fault() and grabs ptl just before the process
doing a fork attempts to grab the ptl to convert the pages to COW.
__handle_mm_fault() will insert the writable pte and unlock ptl then
return with VM_FAULT_WRITE set.  The process doing a fork then gets
the lock and starts converting the pte to RO/COW.  The get_user_pages()
process then clears FOLL_WRITE from foll_flags and calls follow_page()
without write, adds to the map count for the page, but does not have a
writable mapping.
