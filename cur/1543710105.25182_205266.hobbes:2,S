Subject: fbconsole, radeon, default mode?

I'm setting up a Gentoo system, and I have managed (despite my abject 
ignorance) to get fbconsole to work.  Furthermore, I can get fbset to 
work and set whatever mode I want (I hate how fbset uses picoseconds 
instead of megahertz for dotclock, because you can't easily get the 
console display to exactly line up with the X server, but that's neither 
here nor there).
I made an init script to call fbset on boot to set the consoles to the 
mode I want, but there are problems with that I would like to avoid.
What I was wondering is if there was a way to program alternate default 
values into the console driver, say, as kernel config parameters or even 
boot parameters (I don't care which)...  I could even tweak the source 
code!  I don't want to give it just a resolution and have it GUESS about 
timing numbers, because I had to specially tweak the numbers to get 
console and X to line up, so I want to give the driver complete default 
timings.
I have searched the kernel docs, and I have googled to no avail.  Can 
someone here give me some suggestions?
I'm running the latest Gentoo 2.4 kernel which is called 
"2.4.22-gentoo-r7", and I have a Radeon 9000 Pro card.
Thanks!
