Hello Vegard,
It's a bit late but I finally found out about your announcement of
kmemcheck version 7. Are you familiar with the patch that adds support
to Valgrind for User Mode Linux ? I'm not sure what the best approach
is -- letting the kernel do its own checking like kmemcheck or extend
Valgrind such that it supports UML. Anyway, the techniques applied in
Valgrind may be useful for kmemcheck too, such as the algorithms used
in Valgrind to compress the memory state information.
