Hi there,
my Desktop machine 2.6.6-rc2-mm1 got almost unusable starting with Kernel
2.6.6-rc2-mm1. The machine starts up with pdflush eating up all CPU.
2.6.6-rc2 without mm1 has teh same behavour.

Its not happening when I use something like init=/bin/bash, but it does
happen on Normal startup (KDM login).
The only thing which is somewhat exotic with this machine, is the fact, that
there are no filesystems mounted besides NFS (root-NFS).
It did not happen with 2.6.5-rc3 which I have been using before.
I will be able to provide further debugging Information, when somebody tells
me what will be of interest (output of readprofile etc.)
Regards
Sven
