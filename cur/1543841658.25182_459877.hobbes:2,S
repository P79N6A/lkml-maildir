Well, they're probably not out of order per se, but more than some
data on a page granularity was dropped, duplicated, or something. If
you have a bit of coding skills, I'd suggest writing a bunch of 32-bit
ints to a file, in increasing order, and use that as a test case. That
way each 32-bit word is unique, and you might be able to spot a bit
more of a pattern as to what's going on (is it duplicated? Is it out
of order?).
This might give hints to those with bigger brains than mine.
