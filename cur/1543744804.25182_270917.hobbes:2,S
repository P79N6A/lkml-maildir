Hi !
This is my first post on this list, and I could need some help
to know if I made something wrong or if it is a bug ....
I compiled a new kernel and activated following option
General Setup > Sysctrl Support
in order to be able to use hotplug , udev  .....
But on boot I become following error message concerning
my second harddisk (/dev/hdb) which is dedicated to my
old Win2k system :
  Nov 12 19:15:13 ishwara kernel: hdb: read_intr: status=0x59 { 
DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest Error }
 > Nov 12 19:15:13 ishwara kernel: hdb: read_intr: error=0x04 { 
DriveStatusError }
 > Nov 12 19:15:13 ishwara kernel: ide: failed opcode was: unknown
 > Nov 12 19:15:13 ishwara kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev hdb, 
sector 78172098
 > Nov 12 19:15:13 ishwara kernel: Buffer I/O error on device hdb5, 
logical block 61785735
it can last two or three minutes and then I have accsess to my
Gnome Desktop.
This arrives on a 2.6.7 or 2.6.9 kernel if I try to activate Sysctrl
in General Setup, if I deactivate it, I have not such error messages ....
To resume it : Is it a bug ? Or did I make something wrong ? Forget some 
options ?
System : Pentium 4 2,8Ghz
          Motherboard Asus P4P 800
          Chipset I865PE
          and two Maxtor ATA-Harddisks
Thanks for helping
