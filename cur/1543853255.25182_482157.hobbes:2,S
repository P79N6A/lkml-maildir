What about the gendisk object? Since I assigned the queue pointer to it,
it didn't naturally get a chance to increase the reference count. When
can I safely drop my reference without the gendisk getting upset?

Things get a bit muddy by the fact that the mmc layer has a thread that
handles the queue. So I guess we need to have a way to shut down that
thread, but still be able to throw away any stray requests from the
block layer?
