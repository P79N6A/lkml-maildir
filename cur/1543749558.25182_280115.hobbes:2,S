Hi Zwane,
This thread can possibly be stalled forever if there is a CPU hog
running, right?
In which case, you will want to use ssleep rather than a busy loop.
Another alternative may be to use more complex logic to detect that a
CPU is not in the idle loop at all. In that case, a simple cpu_relax
type spin loop should be OK, because the synchronisation would be
achieved very quickly.
