Haven't you OpenLDAP guys realized that the pthread model you're  
actually looking for is this?  POSIX mutexes are not designed to  
mandate scheduling requirements *precisely* because this achieves  
your scheduling goals by explicitly stating what they are.
s: pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
s: pthread_cond_wait(&wake_slave, &mutex);
m: [do some work]
m: pthread_cond_signal(&wake_slave);
m: pthread_cond_wait(&wake_master, &mutex);
s: [return from pthread_cond_wait]
s: [do some work]
s: pthread_cond_signal(&wake_master);
s: pthread_cond_wait(&wake_slave, &mutex);
Of course, if that's the model you're looking for, you could always  
do this instead:
void master_func() {
	while (1) {
		[do some work]
		slave_func();
	}
}
void slave_func() {
	[do some work]
}
The semantics are effectively the same.
Cheers,
