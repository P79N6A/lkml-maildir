I'd rather have this message rate-limited, not dropped completely.
Another long-time concern that I had is that we've got some printk()s
of user-supplied string data.  What about embedded linefeeds - can this
be used to produce fake kernel messages with arbitrary log level (syslog
priority)?  It certainly seems so.
Also, there are terminal controls...
