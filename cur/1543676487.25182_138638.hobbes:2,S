The solution to these things is to _always_ have a separate type for the 
user thing than for the kernel thing. 
In practice, a lot of code has ended up doing that _anyway_, since the
kernel usually wants to have a few extra fields for its internal use. The
classic unix example of this, of course, is "struct stat" vs "struct
inode".
But if your structures are 100% the same, then you can just share them. 
There's nothing wrong with having
	struct ioctl_arg {
		int value;
		int another_value;
		..
	};
and then in your ioctl routines you have
    int my_ioctl_routine(struct ioctl_arg __user *ptr)
    {
	struct ioctl_arg arg;
	if (copy_from_user(&arg, ptr, sizeof(*ptr))
		return -EFAULT;
	...
    }
and that's fine.
You can even have user pointers _inside_ the structure: because "sparse" 
really understands C types at a very fundamental level (like a compiler 
would, not like some simpler source scanner), you can have
	struct ioctl_arg {
		int value;
		void __user *buf;
	};
and do
    int my_ioctl_routine(struct ioctl_arg __user *ptr)
    {
	struct ioctl_arg arg;
	char buffer[10];
	if (copy_from_user(&arg, ptr, sizeof(*ptr))
		return -EFAULT;
and sparse will be aware of the fact that "arg.buf" is a user pointer, and 
it will properly warn if you pass it to a function that expects a kernel 
pointer (or assign it to a normal non-user pointer thing).
