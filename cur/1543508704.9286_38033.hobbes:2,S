That is the HPT 366 chip !
grab the patch from kernel mirrors  ..
/pub/linux/kernel/people/hedrick
try to grab the latest that is for kernel 2.3.17
I think it is great and it is stable .
I'm running it with my IBM DJNA 370190 ( this drive could only
achieved a max buffered disk reads of 17.02 MB/sec only and maybe I
shall try out the fireball ka series)
ah... remember that you need the special 40 pin 80 conductor cable or
I think the chip set would not turn on the UDMA66 mode
enjoy
