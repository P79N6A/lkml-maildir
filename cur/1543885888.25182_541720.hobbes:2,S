My biggest concern right now is struct logfs_super.  That beast has
grown so large that kerneldoc style documentation means you cannot have
the definition (along with type) and the comment on the same screen
anymore.  That sucks.
Whether it sucks more than the current state is open for discussion.
One option I see is to have several kerneldoc style comments.  struct
logfs_super is roughly grouped by the files that "own" a particular
field.  That grouping is best-effort and often somewhat wrong as many
fields are used in more than one file.  But it would allow having one
comment per group.
Downside is that this help human readers of the code but will confuse
existing tools.  Yet another solution that sucks.
Is there a really good way to do it?

If I were a parser, I would give you a point.  But my caveman eyes have
a really hard time finding those darn ";".  Spaces and lack of spaces is
simple.  Big, black, blocking the sun - must be a bear, I better run
now.  Did it have a pimple on its nose?  How should I know?
Do you feel mortally offended if I leave it and that and not change my
code?

#define BUG() do { \

	panic("BUG!"); \
} while (0)
I'm fairly confident that having LOGFS_BUG a #define is the most
efficient way to do things.  It may waste a stack slot for any compiler
unable to optimize that away, fair.  But at least it has all the
functionality.

Not I'm really confused.  So there is a default log level.  And the
BUG-printk obviously gets the default log-level.  But then, how does
that avoid filtering?
Anyway, any surviving printk in my code will fare better with KERN_INFO
or KERN_DEBUG.

Ok, you have a point.

Exactly.  If there was a good way to remove the cast, I would happily
comply.

Will do.

You have a point.
