Well if you like stomping your cpu caches all the time... ;)
Ingo Molnar wrote some 'eccd' around 1997. It did checksum of all readonly
pages in memory, then constantly checked them with a kernel task in the
background when system was idle.
Maybe someone wants to modify this to handle all memory. I have Ingo's
eccd if anyone wants it (for kernel 2.0.x).
