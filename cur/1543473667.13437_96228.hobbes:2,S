Thank you, yes, this states the points I wanted to make.

I'd add a mechanism to ptrace to trigger an in-kernel core dump, perhaps
with a specified file name (to get back to that), or perhaps even add a
new core dump approach that would return the core file to a user buffer,
allowing the core file to be stored remotely. (I'm very interested in this
idea for an embedded design.)
Making the character device world accessible might not be quite right,
though, unless the kernel allows multiple connections, and automatically
gives each connected daemon from the one with the most authority (root
perms) to the least (user perms) a chance at taking the uid, in turn. 
It's probably simpler to have a root daemon that uses /etc/debugconf,
~user/debugconf, etc., to figure out what processes get which treatment.

Yes. Once the daemon gets the uid (and presumably has sufficient
permissions), it can be responsible for triggering any sort of debugger,
ranging from gdb or a core dump, to something resembling Dr. Watson, or
even to something resembling a gdb remote stub, allowing the process to be
debugged over a network. (The daemon could even keep just one process "in
limbo" like this -- if another crashes, it lets the first one die
completely, perhaps generating a core -- again, useful for an embedded
design.)

Agreed on 2.3.x.
