No.  How can an edge triggered interrupt possibly cause a storm?
If the interrupt signal is at logic '0' and it was previously
configured for a low level to interrupt, when you call request_irq()
with your handler, the interrupt will be enabled.
Because it's level sensitive, it'll immediately interrupt, and
the handler will be invoked.  When the handler returns, the interrupt
signal will still be at logic '0' so it's still active.  So you
immediately get another interrupt and the handler will be re-invoked.
Repeat infinitely.
So it is exactly as I describe.

We could do, but I took the set_irq_type() implementation. 8)  We
could change both to conform.
