Hi,
Not having the 8 port board listed in the JSM driver was actually
intentional.
IBM and Digi only want the 2 port Neo board supported in the JSM driver,
as IBM are only using the 2 port Neo products.
Digi has a different and more fully featured driver for the other port
count boards. (1, 4, 8).
If you would like, I can send you the source tarball of this version of
the driver instead,
its called DGNC, and contains more diagnostics and utilities.
LKML, please, do *NOT* apply this patch to the kernel!
It will cause conflicts if our customers have both the Digi DGNC and
IBM/Digi JSM drivers installed!
Thanks!
Scott Kilau

I compile linux-2.6.12_r2 sources with jsm support, but Digi Neo 8 is
unsupported.
after some code-modifications it works fine.
