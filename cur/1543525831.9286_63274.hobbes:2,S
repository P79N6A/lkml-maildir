Two scenarios:
    1) a joystick using application calls:
	  open ("/dev/joystick", ....)
       (or whatever the canonical name for the joystick is). if
       you don't have kmod and have not insmod-ed the relevant module,
       the open(2) call will return with "device not configured"
       or "no such device".
     2) if a driver itself tries to open other devices in 
        the same way, expecting them to be there either via
	direct compilation or insmod, then it won't work
	without tricky manual intervention.
In the case of pppd, I think that it was trying to open /dev/ppp, and
then later was doing stuff that assumed the existence of the
compression modules. even though i had them compiled and "in place",
they were not insmod'ed without manual intervention. thus, pppd will
not run correctly in this scenario without a user having to figure out
all the modules that might be needed. yuck (and in the general case,
non-trivial to do).
note, for example, that ppp_generic and ppp_async do *not* depend on
the compression modules, but that pppd (and perhaps the ppp driver
too, not sure about that) requires them. so depmod doesn't help here
either.
