Nice with a simple memory controller. The downside seems to be that it
doesn't scale very well when it comes to reclaim, but maybe that just
comes with being simple. Step by step, and maybe this is a good first
step?
Ideally I'd like to see unmapped pages handled on a per-container LRU
with a fallback to the system-wide LRUs. Shared/mapped pages could be
handled using PTE ageing/unmapping instead of page ageing, but that
may consume too much resources to be practical.
