maybe your kernel has a broken scheduler loadbalancing? you really
shouldn't have to do this manually. At all.

again you can use gettid() or pthread_self() in that call (but remember
it's a bitmask not a number); but really you shouldn't have to do this.
Try a kernel which has a non-broken load balancer?
