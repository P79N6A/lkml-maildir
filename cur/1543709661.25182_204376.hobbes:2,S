OK, finally a bit of progress.  If you remember back in October 2003 I
reported:

After this, I spent a (small) amount of time looking over the HID code
etc to see what could be causing it.  I could find nothing wrong so I
gave up, connected another USB keyboard, and basically ignored the
problem.  In retrospect, that was Good Thinking, because I was
apparently looking at the wrong code: the problem _does_ appear to be
coming from the USB HCD, not from the HIDeous code.
Specifically, after upgrading to 2.6.4-rc2, _all_ of the ia64 machines
I tested would crash as soon as they had _any_ USB keyboard plugged
in.  That is, the problem no longer was limited to the BTC keyboard,
which is special because it has a built-in hub.  This was encouraging.
Turns out it's this patch that was causing the crashes:
 
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.1619.1.17
That was strange, because even to my USB-untrained eye the patch
looked obviously correct.  However, I think the root cause of the
problem really has to do with a race-condition between the controller
and the driver.  In particular, if I apply the patch below, my USB
keyboards (including the BTC keyboard) work just fine!

Indeed, if I apply this patch instead:

there are no crashes either.
So my theory is that I was seeing this sequence of events:
 - HCD signals WDH interrupt & sends DMA to update the frame number in
   the host-controller communication area (HCCA)
 - host gets interrupt, but skips readl() and hence reads a stale
   frame number N instead of the up-to-date value (N+1)
 - HCD cancels a transfer descriptor (TD), moves it to the "remove list"
   and calculates the frame number at which it can be remove from
   the host-controller's list as N+1
 - SOF interrupt arrives (probably was pending already?)
 - interrupt handler does a readl() and now sees the updated
   frame-number N+1
 - HCD sees that the cancelled TD's time stamp N+1 is <= the current
   current time stamp (N+1) and goes ahead and removes it from the
   host-list, while the controller is still looking at the entry being
   removed
 - HCD ends up dereferencing a bad pointer and ends up reading from
   address 0xf0000000, which on our ia64 machines is a read-only area,
   which then results in a machine-check abort
Does this sound plausible?
What beats me is why UHCI would have the same issue.  I know even less
about UHCI than I do about OHCI but perhaps there is a similar
problem.
