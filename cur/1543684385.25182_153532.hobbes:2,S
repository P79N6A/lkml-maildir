(sorry for the previous bad sent)
The patch (2.6.0-test2-mm2) did fix the asm/local.h missing file problem,
but I'm getting another one:
  CC arch/x86_64/kernel/asm-offsets.s
In file included from include/linux/topology.h:35,
                 from include/linux/mmzone.h:294,
                 from include/linux/gfp.h:4,
                 from include/linux/slab.h:15,
                 from include/linux/percpu.h:4,
                 from include/linux/sched.h:31,
                 from arch/x86_64/kernel/asm-offsets.c:7:
include/asm/topology.h: In function `pcibus_to_cpumask':
include/asm/topology.h:24: error: invalid operands to binary &
make[1]: *** [arch/x86_64/kernel/asm-offsets.s] Error 1
make: *** [arch/x86_64/kernel/asm-offsets.s] Error 2
I'd also like to thanks thoses that replied to me for the previous
problem.
