If we do not re-protect the pages on writeout, we'll decrement the dirty
count but not get a fault on re-dirty. Hence the dirty count will
actually skew.
In order to make page_mkclean() work for nonlinear vmas we need to do a
full pte scan for each invocation (we could perhaps only scan 1 in n
times to try and limit the damage) and that hurts. This will basically
render it useless.
The other solution is adding rmap information to nonlinear vmas but
doubling the memory overhead for nonlinear mappings was not deemed a
good idea.

it'll work up to a certain point (when you hit the max vma count). When
this issue first came up a few weeks ago, nobody knew of any non tmpfs
users.

Its an example, it doesn't show if there are actually users of this, but
point taken. We actually could make this very example work by noting
that they map PROT_READ only.
