For the dynamically registered ioctls there is exactly such a
concept in place. So a try_module_get is done _before_ the
dasd_ioctl_set_eer function is called. That function again calls
dasd_eer_enable_on_device which does the try_module_get you complain
about. So, for each device on which the error reporing is enabled, a
try_module_get is done, and it should be safe for those devices to
call the respective notifier functions later on.

I know that you don't like that dynamic ioctl interface, but I would
like to leave that discussion to Horst.
But besides that, the ioctl in question is needed on the DASD device,
since we want to enable or disable error reporting per DASD device.
