real useful, since
	a) we have no idea if mount() is being done in the same namespace
	b) we have no idea if mount() actually succeeds
	c) even if we manage to find a mountpoint, we have no idea if it
gets e.g. mount --move just as we'd finished reading from /prov/mounts
	d) if the goal is to see which devices are held by mounted fs,
you'll miss such things as e.g. external journals.

*the* corresponding mountpoint?  Which one?  There might be any number
of those...
