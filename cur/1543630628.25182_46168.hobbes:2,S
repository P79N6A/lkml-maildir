What it actually encourages is for people to have multiple throwaway trees. 
(Which isn't quite so much of a BK turnoff once you discover compilercache.)
If the tree's going to be thrown away anyway, it doesn't matter if it gets 
confused -- how about making it a little easier to backport changesets -- 
surely it should be possible to make BK import a changeset iff all the 
affected files are identical in both trees before the changeset?
