On a semi-related note, I'm seeing 7 of these at each boot on a Dell Latitude D820:
pnpacpi: exceeded the max number of mem resources: 12
2.6.24-rc3-mm2 does it, it didn't do it for 2.6.23-mm1.
pnp-increase-the-maximum-number-of-resources.patch raised it from 4 to 12, but
I don't understand why it didn't complain at 4 in 23-mm1, but it does at 12 now.
