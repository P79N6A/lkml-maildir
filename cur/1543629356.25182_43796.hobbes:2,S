Try 
http://www.caldera.com/developers/community/contrib/aim.html
 for a tarball
with everything you'll need.
The "Multiuser Shared System Mix" (aka "workfile.shared") is the one I use.
You'll need several disk spindles to keep it compute-bound, though.  Several
of the disk subtests, especially the sync_* tests, quickly drive one or two
spindles to their max transaction rates, and from that point AIM7 will be
I/O-bound and produce a largely idle system, which isn't very interesting if
you're trying to example CPU scheduler performance with high process counts.
One thing you can do is to comment-out the three sync_* tests in the
workfile.shared configuration file, and then watch your idle time with
something like vmstat.  Experiment with commenting-out more disk subtests,
like creat-clo, disk_cp, and disk_src, one by one, until AIM7 becomes
compute-bound.
