The point is that an out-of-order processor (such as a modern x86)
doesn't execute instructions in the order emitted by the C compiler.  So
in the above expression, it will typically fetch a, b, c, d, e and f,
and execute all the comparisons in parallel.
However, an out of order process will speculatively execute past
branches, so that || version might be just as fast.  And if the branch
predictor is doing a good job, it might just be faster because you don't
issue the unlikely instructions.   But Nathan is from AMD so I'm sure
he's right :-)

Your C is fine.
