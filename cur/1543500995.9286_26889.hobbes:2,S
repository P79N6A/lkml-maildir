Yes w.r.t. detecting changes in a browser that has fds open.
In fact your solution works wheres the serial numbers don't :-)
But the serial numbers have a different use: persistent tracking of
changed files.  E.g. to speed up recursive makes, and to spot changed
files where a checksum would normally be required.
See also the thread "Detecting changed files for JIT/metadata cacheing".
So you're right but there's an separate problem.
