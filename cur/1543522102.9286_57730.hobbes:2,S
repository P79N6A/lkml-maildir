It's the same concept as vmstat.  "vmstat 1" gives VM summaries every
second; "vmstat 10" gives it every 10 seconds.
The standard unix "sar" tool works the same way.  To achieve the same
effect for a load-averaged statistic such as the IO queue utilisation or
the average queue length, you can't let the kernel munge the basic event
counts into a time-averaged value by itself: it doesn't know, on its
own, what interval the user is going to be time-averaging over.
By presenting the stats as raw event counts, user-land can take the
difference between _any_ two points in time and compute the average IO
behaviour between those two points, so even if one user is doing a "sard
1" while another is doing a "sard 100", the results will still be
correct for both.
If we just presented a time-average in /proc, as we do for the load
average, the sard program simply could not emulate the expected sar
behaviour.  sard needs those event counts just as much as vmstat needs
event counts for cpu-mode cycle counts and interrupt counts.  vmstat
could not work given only the load average in /proc.
