Is this for real?  comx.o has been broken since 2.4.0 it seems!
Anyone know anything about these modules?
Darrel, these errors are caused because (though the modules compile) 
they are making references to functions that no longer exist in the 
kernel.  My advice is that (unless you really need to use these modules) 
you configure your kernel to not include them.
