Ok that makes a lot of sense.  You should probably be really using 
pci_alloc_consistent() instead of GFP_DMA directly here, but other than
that it should just work.
(pci_alloc_consistent has some hacks to first try the higher zones
and only use the lower zones if the allocation didn't succeed here -
on a 2GB machine you have a 50% chance that a normal allocation 
ends up below 1GB -  which make this all a bit more reliable) 
That probably explains the lack of reports about this issue
which I mistakenly assumed was because of the cards getting scarce.
Anyways, it shows the aacraid doesn't need GFP_DMA32 at all, which
is good.
I hope there are no other concerns about the patch and Linus 
could just merge it now?
