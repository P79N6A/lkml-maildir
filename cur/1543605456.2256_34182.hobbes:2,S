It's because Linus wants it that way, with a view to encouraging the 
development of algorithms that work well across a broad range of 
configurations without requiring a lot of tuning.  So it's a case of short 
term pain for long term gain.
Keep in mind that once you start exposing tuning parameters you tend to get 
lots of user programs out there that break without the parameters, or if the 
parameters don't behave the same way across versions.  Official tuning 
parameters also get in the way of trying out new algorithms, which might not 
even support the old tweaks, for example.

So then you probably just want to grab one of the many patches that expose 
things through proc and use it as a jumping-off point to expose your own 
tweaks.  As you say, much faster than recompiling every time.
