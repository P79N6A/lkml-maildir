It seems you are right. To be more precise it will not work on a ramdisk at
all.
A normal ramdisk will just fail to mount when there's an iso9660 fs on it,
whereas an initrd seems to cause a panic.
I guess it would be nice to output a somewhat friendly error message instead.
Oh well...
After further research I decided to use romfs instead, since it can too be
generated quite easily with a script, and it works quite well.
