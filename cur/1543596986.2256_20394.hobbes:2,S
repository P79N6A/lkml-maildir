So if the Two Kernel Monte patch was combined with the
system suspend/resume in swap patch then you add some
transitions so that the code path does this:
1-  Suspend->Monte
2-  Monte->Load new Kernel
3-  Load->Resume.
If it was just for very similar kernels, i.e. most
-pre and -ac kernels it would probably work fine.
If not, then you could just do the Monte route.
