Indeed. And that's what I use. In /etc/apt/apt.conf I have:
    DPkg {
        // Auto re-mounting of a readonly /usr
	Pre-Invoke {"mount -o remount,rw /usr";};
	Post-Invoke {"mount -o remount,ro /usr";};
    }

Yep. Apt knows about it, but dpkg doesn't. And remounting /usr read-only
fails if files are in use.
