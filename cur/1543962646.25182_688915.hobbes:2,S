  I agree in particular, but not in principle (;-))
  Changing the filesystem format was something that happened at
least twice on Multics, on production machines. I happened to be
on during one of the changes and didn't even know it was happening
until there was a broadcast message warning of poor performance.
  I always thought that was cool, and got permission recently to
post a colleague's paper on it at 
http://www.multicians.org/stachour.html
  It would be cool if data could change at run-time on Linux, just
like security-sensitive code.
