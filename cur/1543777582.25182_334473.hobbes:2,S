It should work with variable ticks as we can easily add/remove CPUs from this
multicast destination.

And each CPU timer itself does very little writes in terms of caches. The
two things that happen here are scheduler_tick and kstat_accounting. 
Or am I missing something? Did you have anything specific in mind wrt 
bouncing cachelines?
