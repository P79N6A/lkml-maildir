	If a system uses dynamic addressing, binding to an IP that wasn't currently
available would be useless, since the odds are that this address would never
ever be available locally. In fact, if a machine had dynamic addressing, any
code that bound to a specific local IP would never be able to be connected
to once that IP was lost.
	It is only machines that have static IPs that might not currently be usable
that would benefit from being able to bind to an address that wasn't
currently local. In this case, the IP may return to the machine in the
future.
