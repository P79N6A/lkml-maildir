Don't worry, that idea has been shot down more than once ;-)

Understood, but I'm going to start looking in the way Rusty and Arnd
suggested with the vmalloc approach. This would allow for saving of
memory and dynamic allocation of module memory making it more robust. And
all this without that evil extra indirection!
So lets put my original patches where they belong, in the bit grave and
continue on. I lived, I learned and I've been shown the Way (thanks to
all BTW).
So now we can focus on a better solution.
Cheers,
