matroxfb without parameters start in 640x480 before 2.3.13 and in 640x400
after 2.3.13. For new default, 25 - 4 (logo) < 25 :-( For 640x480, it
should work. Which LILO switches are you using? vga=XXX does nothing good
to matroxfb; video=matrox:vesa:0x105 works fine for me.

You have strange system... When you are pressing shift-PgUp, are there
penguins on the screen or are not?

I prefer video=scrollback:0. I tested it here and that's what I get:
video=vga16:off video=matrox:vesa:0x105
shift-pgup: works correctly (hides logo, scrolls down)
shift-pgdn: repeated pressing this walks through circular in-kernel
   scrollback buffer. It is bug.
video=vga16:off video=matrox:vesa:0x105 video=scrollback:0
shift-pgup: does nothing (no scrollback when logo). It is what it is supposed
   to do.
shift-pgdn: does nothing. It is correct.
So I think that problem is in scrollback code. Unfortunately, I spent about
two days with scrollback code and results was worse than when I started :-(
