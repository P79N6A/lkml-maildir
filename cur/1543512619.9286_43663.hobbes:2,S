I bet you wish the bug reports generated from the buggy bioses problem ended
up in the BIOS manufacturer E-mail box, not yours.  
Bit hard to write a standard into an kernel/operating system if the
manufacturers themselves can't follow standards!
Congratulations on doing so well despite the limitless hardware variation
that exists.
Thanks to all the hard workers out there,
