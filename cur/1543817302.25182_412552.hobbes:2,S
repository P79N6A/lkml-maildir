Hi Pavel,
There are a few issues with this. Firstly,
 CC      arch/arm/common/locomo.o
arch/arm/common/locomo.c: In function `locomo_frontlight_set':
arch/arm/common/locomo.c:1061: error: `LOCOMO_ALC_EN' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/arm/common/locomo.c:1061: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
arch/arm/common/locomo.c:1061: error: for each function it appears in.)

That default statement gives cause for concern. Should it not return
-EINVAL for intensities outside of 0-4?

Maximum brightness is 4 above?

Could this be changed to:
#ifdef CONFIG_SA1100_COLLIE
	sa1100fb_lcd_power = locomolcd_power;
#endif
	backlight_device_register("locomo-bl", NULL, &locomobl_data);
 	return 0;
This means that it will also present a backlight interface on poodle. In
fact I've already helped a poodle user test this and it works!
Also note that there are some backlight interface changes sitting in -mm
(see the linux-fbdev-devel mailing list) which this patch isn't covered
by. If this patch gets merged first, I'll make sure it gets adapted to
the new interface though (which actually brings some benefits like power
attribute implementation for free).
Cheers,
Richard
