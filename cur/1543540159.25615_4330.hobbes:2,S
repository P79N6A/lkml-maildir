Hello
I have adaptec 29160, when trying to install RH6.2 it gives me this
error
<4>(scsi0:0:1: 0)Parity error durring data-In phase
I tried all kinds of things, and it still doesnt work. This is a brand
new machine, it had NT4.0 on it before and it worked fine.
Any help would be greatly appriciated.
