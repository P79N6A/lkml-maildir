Call it as you may.  Whether some style violates more sections of the
CodingStyle than exist in written form or it hurts the taste of 99% of
all developers ever having to tough it, my short form for that is "bad
style".
Point remains, there is a lot of "bad style" and inconsistency in the
kernel.  But fixing all of it and keeping it fixed would result in a
lot of work and maybe a couple of device drivers less.  For what gain?
