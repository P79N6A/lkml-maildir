No, you don't. Moreover, inode of device (even if you had it) _doesn't_
contain a reference to sb of filesystem mounted from that device.

/me looks at From:
OK, Albert, what have you done with real Martin?
OK, whoever you are - no, "expandable" interfaces of that sort are
rotten idea. What we really need is to replace sync_dev with fsync_dev -
it _is_ correct in such context. That's it - 1 bit of information, no
