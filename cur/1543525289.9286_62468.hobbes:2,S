He wanted me to move the SCSI device entries from directories like
/dev/sd, /dev/sg, /dev/sr and so on to a "logical physical" heirarchy
under /dev/scsi, where subdirectory names map to the SCSI address
components (i.e. bus, target, lun).
Also, he wanted me to rip out the compatibility entries so the kernel
was left with a clean namespace.
