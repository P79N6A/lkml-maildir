Would you accept a patch which causes the deprecated sysfs
files/directories to disappear, even if CONFIG_SYS_DEPRECATED is
defined, via a boot-time parameter?  Many people and distros are
likely to keep CONFIG_SYS_DEPRECATED defined just our of paranoia that
things might break.  Doing a quick google, I note that Fedora has been
going back and forth of turning it off, watching things break, and
then turning it back on.  The latest time, the changelog said:
* Fri Jan 26 23:00:00 2007 Bill Nottingham <notting{%}redhat{*}com>
    - turn on CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED so that things actually work. *sigh*
(and I've checked, Fedora's CVS still has CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED
defined; it's not just Debian at fault here.)
So having a boot-time parameter would make it much easier for
application programmers (who run distro kernels and who are unlikely
to want to compile their own custom kernel) to test to see what breaks
without CONFIG_SYS_DEPRECATED.
