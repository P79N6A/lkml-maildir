Hi!
So what's the reason for not yet allowing bind mounts for non-root
users?  That #ifdef has been there since ages.
I'm also interested whether it would be possible to allow non-root
mounts of "safe" filesystems.  Or is there some inherent security
problem with that?  By "safe" I mean a filesystem that would not allow
access to more things that the user is normally allowed.  (e.g.
filesystems for ftp/ssh/tar etc.)
Thanks,
Miklos
