Did you expect the PCI_COMMAND_MASTER disabled in the USB Controller
or something else in the controller turned off?
Turning off MASTER will also disable the controller from responding
to MMIO ...ie USB subsystem can't touch the USB controller until
it's re-enabled (no USB interrupts). That's ok if PCI will re-enable
USB controller in a later PCI setup phase. In general I expect a driver
to call pci_enable_device() but I don't know anything about USB intialization
when it's part of the "console" (HID).
BTW, I wasn't thinking of USB.  I'm just trying to understand if the "fix"
is exclusively in the PCI code or will require changes to other subsystems.

The implemention to enforce that is what I meant with "arch specific code".
I still have no idea which bridge implementations (vendor/model)
have this problem and thus no idea what the i386 code would need 
to look like. I was hoping Ivan (or someone) might know.
thanks,
