Offhand, I don't see a way to resolve it in the preallocation scheme.
That's not on my list of stuff to worry about.  But, who knows,
someone else might find that a valid concern.

Oh dear.  I'm drifting away from advocating a pid-range preallocation
and toward thinking we need a more systematic approach, design and
architecture.  This isn't just pids.  Simple range based preallocation
won't help much on some of the other resources that we need to virtualize.
The Zap pods are sounding good to me right now, properly embedded
in the kernel rather than hacking the syscall table via a module.
In any case, I am suspecting that starting the job in some sort
of nice container should be a prerequisite for relocating or
checkpoint/restarting the job.
