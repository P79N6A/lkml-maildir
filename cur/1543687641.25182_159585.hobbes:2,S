Subject: [PATCH] Fix bug in v4l core for 2.6.0-test3-bk

Hi,
When working on converting the usb v4l drivers to the new v4l class
changes, I ran into this nasty bug.  Seems that the core was using a
structure after it had been freed.  The patch below fixes it.
If you don't mind, I'll include it with some USB patches in a send to
Linus, as my USB fixes will not work without it.
thanks,
greg k-h
