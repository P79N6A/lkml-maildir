Actually, talking to some people off-list, I realised that what happened 
with the instances I saw was probably that the packets were corrupted 
inside the host, somewhere after the ethernet checksum had done its job. 
DMA problems or a slow address line on some RAM somewhere could easily beat 
the TCP checksum, but as many folks have pointed out, ethernet CRC is much 
stronger.
Having seen something odd like that in practice, I overestimated the 
probability of these problems.
It was also pointed out that iSCSI also makes it's CRC optional only if 
there is some other mechanism (ESP, AH or some other high-integrity 
transport) providing the data integrity.  Partly this is because that 
checksum is the same as used by Fiber Channel, and is therefore available 
'for free' in some, but not all, hardware, so there needs to be another way 
to integrity protect the data.
