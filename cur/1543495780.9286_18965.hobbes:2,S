2.2.7 with Trond's NFSv3 patch. Running Zeus web server. Many processes
stuck in D state. Lilo would not even return to a command prompt after I
reran it to change the default bootup server. Works fine as long as there
is no network load, as soon as the world was let loose on the web server,
it got flaky.
I had to revert to stock 2.2.5 IN A HURRY so there was not any time to
test it. Not sure if the problem was kernel or NFS related (the web server
is serving content from an NFS mounted directory and logging to an NFS
mounted file. Log dir is mounted noac because of weirdness).
Are there any known issues along these lines reported with stock 2.2.7?
