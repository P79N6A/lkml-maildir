Assuming that 2.6.18 is imminent, as I understand it is, then my
preferred option would be for GFS2 to spend one more cycle in -mm,
assuming that nobody would disagree with that. I pretty sure that we'll
be ready by the time 2.6.19 comes around to request inclusion upstream
but 2.6.18 might be just a bit too soon,
Steve.
