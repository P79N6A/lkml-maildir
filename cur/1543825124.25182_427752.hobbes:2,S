Well, /boot/config-`uname -r` would not work right here, as well as on
a number of people's systems that I know, simply because a solution to
avoid the awful mess in /boot is to mkdir /boot/$(uname -r) and put
your System.map, .config and bzImage there (BTW, I also put modules
there since my /lib/modules is a symlink to /boot). This way, there
is only *ONE* rm -rf to do to remove an old unused kernel. So in this
case, it would be /boot/$(uname -r)/.config.
On another subject, I find /proc/config.gz useful when debugging kernels
because this is the only *safe* way to know what was put in a given kernel
that I have booted in the middle of others. However, I agree that this
does not bring much usefulness on distro kernels.
Cheers,
Willy
