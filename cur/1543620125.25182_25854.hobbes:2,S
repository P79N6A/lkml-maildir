I can confirm that there are filesystem corruption issues with 2.5.3;
after this message I rebooted and did a forced fsck which turned up
around a half dozen inodes where the block count in the inode itself was
too high.
The box has been rock solid before this. Configuration:
00:07.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82371AB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01)
ext3 filesystem, data=journal mode.  P-II 400, 288MB.
