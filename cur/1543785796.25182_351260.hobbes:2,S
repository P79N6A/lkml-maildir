So modify it this way:
	atomic_lock(flags);
	do {
		old = atomic_load_locked(v);
		if (!old)
			break;
		new = old + 1;
	} while (!atomic_store_locked(v, old, new));
	atomic_unlock(flags);

In this case it's massively repeated code which only differs slighty. My 
biggest problem here is the lack of gcc support to get the condition code 
out of an asm. Especially architectures with locked load/store instruction 
could then have just a single implementation in asm-generic.
A long time ago I was playing with something like this:
#define atomic_exchange(ptr, old, new) ({		\
	old = *(ptr);					\
	asm volatile ("1:"				\
		: "=&a" (old), "=m" (*(ptr))		\
		: "0" (old), "m" (*(ptr))		\
		: "memory");				\
	asm volatile (__LOCK "cmpxchg %2,%0; jne 1b"	\
		: "=m" (*(ptr)), "=&a" (old)		\
		: "r" (new), "m" (*(ptr)), "1" (old)	\
		: "memory");				\
})
so e.g. an atomic_add_return() would be atomic_exchange(ptr, old, old + 
val), but I guess gcc people would kill me for that. :-)
