IMHO we should remove *all* former ATI "AMD" chipset global MSI
disabling quirks... The whole idea was to sort things out once and for
all. At least the RS480 quirk can be removed, now that the USB driver
has the workaround for the SB400 southbridge USB. I suspect the same
counts for the other ATI chipsets...
To quote Greg K-H:
"But for now, let's not take a band-aid that prevents others from
working to solve the real issues here."
