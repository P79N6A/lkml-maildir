What you describe is pretty much exactly what my anobjrmap patch
from a year ago did.  I'm currently looking through that again
to bring it up to date.

It's a bit more complicated because page->mapping currently contains
&swapper_space if PageSwapCache(page) - indeed, at present that's
exactly what PageSwapCache(page) tests.  So I reintroduced a
PageSwapCache(page) flagbit, avoid the very few places where mapping
pointing to swapper_space was actually useful, and use page->private
instead of page->index for the swp_entry_t.
(Andrew did point out that we could reduce the scale of the mods by
reusing page->list fields instead of mapping/index; but mapping/index
are the natural fields to use, and Andrew now has other changes in
-mm which remove page->list: so the original choice looks right again.)

I believe page_referenced() can just walk the page tables,
but try_to_unmap() needs vma to check VM_LOCKED (we're thinking
of other ways to avoid that, but they needn't get mixed into this)
and for flushing cache and tlb (perhaps avoidable on some arches?
I've not checked, and again that would be an optimization to
consider later, not mix in at this stage).

That's always been a fallback solution, I was just a little too ashamed
to propose it originally - seems a little wrong to waste whole pages
rather than wasting a few bytes of data structure trying to track them:
though the pages are pageable unlike any data structure we come up with.
I think we have page_table_lock in copy_one_pte, so won't want to do
it quite like that.  It won't matter at all if pages are transiently
untrackable.  Might want to do something like make_pages_present
afterwards (but it should only be COWing instantiated pages; and
does need to COW pages currently on swap too).
There's probably an issue with Alan's strict commit memory accounting,
if the mapping is readonly; but so long as we get that counting right,
I don't think it's really going to matter at all if we sometimes fail
an mremap for that reason - but probably need to avoid mistaking the
common case (mremap of own area) for the rare case which needs this
copying (mremap of inherited area).
