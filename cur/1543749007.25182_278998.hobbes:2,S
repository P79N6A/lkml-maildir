More interestingly (where "interesting" is defined as "could be really 
nasty") it's likely to interact very badly in cases where we have some 
_physically_ local clocks. Ie we might have some situation where we do 
some node-local thing for intra-node scheduling, with some other clock for 
inter-node scheduling. Exposing such a clock to a process that isn't 
actually using it could result in the node-local clock source suddenly 
needing to be exposed outside the node.
Think single-image clusters etc.
So in general, it's better to try to keep things as local as possible, 
even if it's not a visibility issue today. Some day you might be happy you 
did..
