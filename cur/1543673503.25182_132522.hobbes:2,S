The general case we use is to optimize for maximum ops-per-second.  The
potential benefit from queueing is indicated by the delta between random
write performance (cached operations we can order for performance) versus
random read performance (cache misses we can't choose the order of).  In a
virtual drive with near-infinite queue depth, rotational latency completely
factors out so the you get equal ops/sec from a 7200 RPM drive as you do
from a 15K RPM drive.  That is what we are shooting for.

I am working here to test usability with TCQ on our prototypes so I can
evaluate these sorts of queue depth issues and whether I think we're doing
the right stuff algorithmically in the drive.  Hopefully some of my effort
helps.
