Hello developers,
is it possible to disable the spin-down (or powerdown) of hard disks
when halting the system, via the kernel cmd-line or some
configurations in /proc?
If not, what would be the appropriate places in the sources where the
spin-down requests are sent to hard disks upon system halt?
I'm currently using x86 with IDE drives, but I think the (eventual)
solution should be platform independent.
