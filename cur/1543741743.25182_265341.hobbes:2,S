Are you sure this is the same problem, that I have? You discovered

The next difference: 
You have the S2885 (thunder K8W) and S2875S (tiger K8W single processor) 
boards and I have a S2875 (tiger K8W double processor)
I summarize (again) my problems:
Independantly of the memory settings in the BIOS:
 - non-SMP Kernel is stable
 - memtest86 does not report any errors
If the memory (4GB) is set up in one block (0-4GB) in the BIOS, then
 - SMP Kernel is stable 
If the memory (4GB) is set up in two blocks (eg. 0-3GB, 4-5GB) in the
BIOS, then
 - SMP Kernel is stable _if_and_only_if_ NUMA is _disabled_.
BTW.: I won't be able to flash a new BIOS to our machine, since it is in 
production use and runs _rock_stable_ with _full_memory_ after we
_disabled_ NUMA support in the kernel. (see the two small programs posted 
by me and by Andi Kleen)
What I COULD do is running some tests if needed. (e.g. to check if the 
Board/BIOS is lying about its capabilities)
