Why is context switches between two kernel threads flushing the L1
cache?  Is this a flaw in the ARM arch?  I would think the only thing
that needs to be done between a context switch of two kernel threads (or
even a user thread to a kernel thread) is update the general regs and
stack. The memory access (page_tables or whatever ARM uses) should stay
the same.
Perhaps something else is at fault here.
Thanks for testing!
