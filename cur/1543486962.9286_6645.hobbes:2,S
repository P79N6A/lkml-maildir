Subject: 2.2.1 SMP: NFS can't get a request slot

Can someone explain what this message means?
Feb  4 08:51:15 sk kernel: nfs: task 31658 can't get a request slot 
Feb  4 08:51:41 sk kernel: nfs: task 31659 can't get a request slot 
Feb  4 08:51:49 sk kernel: nfs: task 31660 can't get a request slot 
After seeing these messages, nfs on this SMP 2.2.1 machine no longer
works.  The problem only seems to crop up if the machine accesses its own
nfs server (ie: export a directory and then access the directory via amd's
automounter on the same machine).  
Thanks
