I'm actually against the idea of reseting a trace everytime we enable it.
That is:
echo 1 > /debug/tracing/tracing_enabled
This should not reset the tracer. I actually do tracing where I disable 
and enable it around areas I am interested in. I want all tracing, not 
just the last one.
Now we have recently added /debug/tracing/tracing_on which can quickly 
stop tracing. I may be able to use that, and we can let the 
tracing_enable" reset it too.
I'll have to take a look at my scripts to see if that would work.
