    With my configuration, devfs adds 33k to the kernel.
    14k of that is the driver glue, and it looks like fs/devfs/core.c
    has about a 40/60% split between the kernel database and the 
    presentation layer.
    Say the presentation layer is about 16k.   It's perfectly possible
    that the fs interface is not the cleanest in the world (I'd be
    delighted to know _in detail_ what the problems are with the current
    interface; there has been enough vague handwaving about possible
    shortcomings to fill a small boat), and you could probably get some
    minor savings by stripping out some of the features and present a
    flat filesystem without the namespace code.
    I don't think you can do much better with an emasculated version
    of the code;  as it stands right now, the notifier code could be
    changed to spit out
	add device=sdxx major=? minor=? options=?
    to clients hanging of .devfsd with no more kernel impact than the
    format string for the abovementioned line.
    Richard, if I produced an emasculated version of the patch that only
    populates a flat filesystem with major and minor numbers required,
    would you accept it?
