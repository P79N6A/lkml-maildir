	Agreed - very likely.  User-Mode Linux does the same for its UML 
memory images.
	To see what process is doing this, try looking at:
ls -Al /proc/[0-9]*/fd/* | grep ' /tmp/'
	Which will show you all open files in /tmp, deleted or not.
lr-x------    1 wstearns wstearns       64 Dec 11 10:23 /proc/10370/fd/6 -> /tmp/sfs8eEBBc (deleted)
	The pid following /proc/ (10370 in this case) is the process 
holding this file open.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
