I couldn't get these to apply and I didn't understand the relationship
between these new patches and your earlier
jbd[2]-replace-potentially-false-assertion-with-if-block.patch and
jbd[2]-only-create-debugfs-entries-if-cache-initialisation-is-successful.patch
so I just dropped everything.
Please redo and resend against next -mm or
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/,
 thanks.
