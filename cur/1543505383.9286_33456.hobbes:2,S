I think what you are describing is just the normal effects of system
load. I use esd for making noise and even with esd and mpg123 reniced
to something as drastic as -18 I still get sound problems. The system
feels perfectly responsive and the load is low, the sound just
stutters. It definitely makes me think it is something in the kernel
(like maybe the cd writing software is locking the bus for a while so
no sound can be written to the sound card?). If someone tells me how
to diagnose this, I will do, until then, I am forced to feign
ignorance and not play mp3s while burning CDs.
