Yes, there are cases like this where that might make sense.  However
there's no real way for udev itself to solve those cases.  You will have
to rely on some other method to do this (script to load module, making
the /dev node yourself, script to make dev node and then access it which
causes kmod to load the module, etc.)
thanks,
