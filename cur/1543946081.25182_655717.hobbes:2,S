We fixed:
- PIO auto-tuning in core code
- PIO programming in host drivers
- IORDY handling in core code and in host drivers (it could be that the
  incorrect IORDY handling was the main reason behind the "downgrade")
and
- lack of corresponding "quirk" in libata hasn't been problematic so far
so IMO there is no longer a valid reason to punish PIO performance
and the said "quirk" should be removed (in 2.6.26 after long time in -mm).
