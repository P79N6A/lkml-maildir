The approach has already been tried (see the XFS layer) and found lacking. 
Having a fake linear block through vmalloc means that a special software 
layer must be introduced and we may face special casing in the block / fs 
layer to check if we have one of these strange vmalloc blocks.

I do understand what the problem is. I just do not get what your problem 
with this is and why you have this drive to demand perfection. We are 
working a variety of approaches on the (potential) issue but you 
categorically state that it cannot be solved.

Because it has already been rejected in another form and adds more 
layering to the filesystem and more checking for special cases in which 
we only have virtual linearity? It does not reduce the number of page 
structs that have to be handled by the lower layers etc.
Maybe we coud get to something like a hybrid that avoids some of these 
issues? Add support so something like a virtual compound page can be 
handled transparently in the filesystem layer with special casing if 
such a beast reaches the block layer?

See my other mail. That portion is not complete yet. Sorry.
