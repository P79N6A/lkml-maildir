Maybe jbd 'sucks' for something 'cool' like reiser*, and modifying jbd to be 
'eleet enough' for reiser* would overwhelm ext.
Lastly, there is the 'political' thing, when a <your-favorite-jbd-fs>-only 
specific change to jbd is rejected by all other jbd-using fs. (Basically the 
situation thing that leads to software forks, in any area.)
