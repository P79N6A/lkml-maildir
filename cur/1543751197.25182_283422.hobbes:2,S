Yes, that would be the Full MAC prism chipsets with the linux prism54 driver,
which I help maintain.

That is correct. They have already moved to the Softmac design and
you're lucky if you can buy FullMAC chipsets in stores now.

Definitely, I agree. Anyone have an idea of how much buying a wireless
chipset design may cost?

I think they made the move because of economics as you mentioned
earlier. Under the current circumstances, I find it hard to be able to
Convince Conexant, for example, to start selling FullMAC chipsets again.
AFAICT the FullMAC chipsets have reached the END OF LIFE period.
