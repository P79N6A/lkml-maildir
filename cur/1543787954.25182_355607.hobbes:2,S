Yeah, we sometimes tend to put drivers in a menu depending
on what technology or interfaces they use.
E.g., some RAID drivers are under Block Devices because they are
implemented as block devices.
That's probably not the best place for them from a user
perspective, but instead of putting them under IDE or SCSI
support, I would rather see them merged with the
Multi-device support menu (RAID and LVM), which appears
to be mostly for infrastructure, not for device drivers,
but there could be a separate section of it for device drivers
IMO.
SATA (currently) uses SCSI software interfaces, so it lives in the
SCSI menus.  Yes, that might not make sense to some people.
Maybe a separate menu for SATA would make sense...
Want to propose some changes via patches?  I have no idea how
well accepted they might be.
