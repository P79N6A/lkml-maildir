This is exactly what I wanted to do. hdparm suspend which would send 
things to cache or buffer and then copy or get files only when needed. I 
just hope is fast enough, but we could trigger this with tilting or 
vibration and then something heavier when we find a free fall.
This driver does not exactly has to behave like Windows. It can be 
better. We always make things better.
