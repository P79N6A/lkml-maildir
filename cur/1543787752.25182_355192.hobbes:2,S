Which didn't work out. The bug disappeared... Probably my ISP messed
something up in their config and fixed it afterwards.
Really weird.
Before, I've tried 10 times each:
2.6.13 and changeset 8917 were getting IP address correctly, while
2.6.14-rc1 after the changeset not. Now all versions work fine.
Including 2.6.14-rc3.
