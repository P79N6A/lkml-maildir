Yeah, the on-demand readahead can avoid _all_ lookups for small in-cache files.
But what do you mean by AS?

The earlier ones focus on features, while this one aims to be simple.
Even simpler than the current readahead, while keeping the same feature set.
The on-demand readahead is now on top of them, but can/will be made
independent.

The magic numbers are for easier testings, and will be removed in
future.  For now, they enables convenient comparing of the two
algorithms in one kernel.
If this new algorithm has been further tested and approved, I'll
re-submit the patch in a cleaner, standalone form. The adaptive
readahead patches can be dropped then. They may better be reworked as
a kernel module.

White space in patch description?
OK, thanks.
