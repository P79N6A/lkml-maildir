OK. Tekram DC390F is a ncr53c875 based UW SCSI host adapter. Can be driven
by either ncr53c8xx or sym53c8xx (or even a solution of Tekram: tmscsiw, but
I don't recommend that). Those drivers are known to work quite well.
The only trouble reported so far seems to be that the driver in very special
circumstances does not report a unit attention for unknown reasons (and the
driver may be completely irresponsible for it), so that a disk change
(applies to removable disks, obviously) is not getting known to the kernel.

.. and this points to trouble in the network stack.
