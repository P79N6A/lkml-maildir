Probably ok in kernel.

Can I suggest this is handled in user-space, but using kernel hooks?
That is, the kernel is asked to open a file as directory or whatever, 
and just like the hacks to cd into a tar file, the kernel invokes a
user-space solution to create & cache the fake files.
I suggest there are a lot of things that could be done by extending the
userfs approach to try dynamically allocating mount points.  Kernel
support could be very simple.
  - Treating an archive file as a directory (podfuk?)
  - Viewing a structured storage directory as a flat file
  - URL access (http, ftp)
