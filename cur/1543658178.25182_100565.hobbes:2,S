So Cisco now will turn on and leave the Header and Data Digests on, this
differs from your last initiator test.

No, you just lost the context of Oliver's question about doing it all from
user space.  Whereas it could be suggested "a target" drops in to the
respective builting FS support.  Why, because attempting to bypass the
double memcpy to/from user/kernel space.
Since it is a pure "block-transport", and execution the raw data transport
to the spindle, the stack does not care about anything about.  Block is a
bit-bucket as what defines SAN.

As you should not, these are data transport QAQC for the respective
"targets".  Initiators make no money, but "targets" do.

Yep, will see you that refector to discuss a hole in the ERL=1 with a
header digest failure w/ the S_BIT set.  It get tossed out and now you end
up with a status sequuence number order problem.
Who owns the mess, Target or Initiator ?
I do not care, because I have both sides covered to support all 11:11
regardless of the support level when talking to your switch with my
initiator, or your initiator talking to my target.
