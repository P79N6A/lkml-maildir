Yes.
But I have been running the same load with latence timing on and have not
seen traces of more than ~50us.
I do have problems with calibration of the clock in both rtc_wakeup and
realfeel2 due to frequency scaling, but it looks like if I have a cpu-hog
running it settles itself on the 697MHz as it should. But could this
frequency scaling lead to bad readings? If it for some reason scales down
the clock during a test it ought to give lower clock counts than the real
ones, not higher...
