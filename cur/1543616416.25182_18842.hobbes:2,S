Your patch makes whitespace changes to a lot of dbg() statements, but
does not modify their contents.  Can you please change this, as this
change does not need to happen.

2.4.18-pre2 has a _lot_ of usb changes and this patch misses a number of
places.
I'd also like to see this against the 2.5.x tree first, as the
recommended compiler for the 2.4.x tree is still 2.95.3, and I don't
think that will change anytime soon.
