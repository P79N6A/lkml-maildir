f5ibh,
It means that it should be opening a PF_PACKET socket (see packet(7))
instead of a PF_INET, SOCK_PACKET (see COMPATIBILITY ip(7)):
    "For compatibility with Linux 2.0, the obsolete socket(PF_INET,
     SOCK_RAW, protocol) syntax is still supported to open a
     packet(7) socket.  This is deprecated and should be replaced by
     socket(PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, protocol) instead.  The main
     difference is the new sockaddr_ll address structure for generic
     link layer information instead of sockaddr_pkt." - ip(7)
