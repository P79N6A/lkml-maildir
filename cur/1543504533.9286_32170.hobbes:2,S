Just because PCI cards might be sharing interrupt lines or is there
any other reason?

It's true you can't do shared interrupts with my driver. But it'll
never try that: It requests the interrupt without SA_SHIRQ so your
scenario could never happen. You just get -EBUSY when you open the
device and the interrupt happens to be in use.
