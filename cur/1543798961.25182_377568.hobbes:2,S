The rt2500-1.1.0-b3 (not the same as rt2500pci!) package does not include 
its own ieee tree yet, so that can't be the issue. Anyway, I tried the card 
in on a different box, and it worked there. Strange enough that it's 
always the motherboard which fails it. The one where it does not work is a 
VIA something motherboard with an AMD K6-2/500 CPU.
