Should be pretty easy.  With either the old-IDE driver or libata, 
complete a command without acknowledging an interrupt.  For libata, that 
means poking around in ata_host_intr() and avoiding well-built hardware 
like AHCI.  Anything that uses ata_piix driver, basically all Intel 
machines, should be applicable in the "not well built" category... :)
