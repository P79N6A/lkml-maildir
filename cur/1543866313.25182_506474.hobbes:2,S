Understanding of what mkuboot.sh is doing leads to:
-- ordinary addition of PATH to (possible) executable, named mkimage;
-- in case of any other problem to execute it: permissions, aliasing due to
   wrong $PATH (and setting it up isn't handle either), script will print
   *wrong* message, in case of CROSS_COMPILE filename;
-- minor overkill due to double wrapping of all of this;
`make' itself executes programs by search $PATH, prints *right*
messages in case of errors.
Unless author of the patch or script itself have really strong position to
not remove it, please.
There are currently four users of this, all like this:
MKIMAGE := $(srctree)/scripts/mkuboot.sh
[...]
quiet_cmd_uimage = UIMAGE  $@
      cmd_uimage = $(CONFIG_SHELL) $(MKIMAGE) -A sh -O linux -T kernel \
                    -C gzip -a $(KERNEL_LOAD) -e $(KERNEL_LOAD) \
                    -n'Linux-$(KERNELRELEASE)' -d $< $@
proposition is to substitute:
     "$(CONFIG_SHELL) $(MKIMAGE)"
with
     "mkimage"
and optional, for particular Makefile, "$(CROSS_COMPILE)" prefix.
Remove mkuboot.sh.
