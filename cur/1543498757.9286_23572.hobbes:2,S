Linux 1.0.0 had some backward compatibility with a sys_mount() which
expected only 3 arguments, not 5.  Would anyone care very much if this
compatibility were to simply go away without warning in 2.3?
I'm sure there's someone out there with binaries that haven't been
recompiled since some unspecified time before March 1994 (I can't be
bothered to trawl through the Historic directory to find exactly when
this change occurred), but it would be really nice to tidy this up.
Thanks.
