No, that's not what's happening. If you disassemble the code at
c000:blah in a laptop, you'll often find that it jumps off to a
completely different section of address space. During POST, that
contains video BIOS. After POST, it may be something like USB boot
support. Without reading it directly out of flash, it's not possible to
recover that code.

These tools can cause machines to hang, even if run immediately after
boot (and without X running). On other machines, things are less bad -
they just switch the backlight off instead. On some machines (Thinkpads
are quite good in this respect), they'll work nicely.
