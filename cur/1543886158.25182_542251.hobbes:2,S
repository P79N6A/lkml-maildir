It now hangs in a similar fashion in the device_resume() call.
If I back off Thomas's clockevents-fix-resume-logic-updated-version.patch
and include just the above patch the machine does suspend and resume
correctly.
I can delve further into the device_resume() hang if we think it would be
useful.  Maybe Linus's clock-stomping tracer can help here, if I can
remember how to use it.
