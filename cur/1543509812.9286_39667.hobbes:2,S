[1.] One line summary of the problem:
     initrd not working in 2.3.18
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
     Hi,
     I can't get initrd working with the 2.3.18 kernel; for  me  this
     is  on  a  PowerPC  system (MPC850), but the problem seems to be
     general to me:
     Problem: "/linuxrc" is never run, because in init/main.c:
	 669         if (mount_initrd && ROOT_DEV != real_root_dev
	 670             && MAJOR(ROOT_DEV) == RAMDISK_MAJOR && MINOR(ROOT_DEV) == 0) {
     mount_initrd has the value 0.
     This is because in init/main.c:
	 651         if (initrd_start && mount_initrd) root_mountflags &= ~MS_RDONLY;
	 652         else mount_initrd =0;
     initrd_start is 0, after it had a usefule value before.
     The problem seems to be in  drivers/block/rd.c:  the  gunzip  in
     crd_load()  [line  839]  returns  ok,  so crd_load() return 0 to
     rd_load_image() [line  568],  where  we  `goto  successful_load'
     [line  640].  There  [line  645]  infile.f_op->release points to
     initrd_release(), which is called [line 277]:  it  releases  the
     initrd,   sets   initrd_start=0  [line  284],  and  this  causes
     init/main.c to think there is no initrd.
     How is this supposed to work?
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
     boot, initial ram disk, mount
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
     2.3.18
[5.] Output of Oops.. message with symbolic information resolved 
     ---
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
 problem (if possible)
     ---
[7.] Environment
     Custom MPC850 board
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)
       Plain 2.3.18 kernel
[7.2.] Processor information (from /proc/cpuinfo):
       Motorola MPC850
[7.3.] Module information (from /proc/modules):
       none
[7.4.] SCSI information (from /proc/scsi/scsi):
       none
[7.5.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
   (please look in /proc and include all information that you
    think to be relevant):
       none
TIA,
Wolfgang
