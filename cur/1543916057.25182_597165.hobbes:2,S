I fully agree.
... Further more, multiple printk_symbols should be combined into a
single, multi-line printk transaction. (To prevent debug printk's from
trashing a BUG() dump_stack).

This is my first contribution to the Linux kernel. As such I rather
start small, and work my way up slowly. (Read: solve the immediate stack
over-run now, think about changing the symbol_display interface later)

I do agree that the current interface needs work.
... But as I said, I rather start slowly and on small scale. (Though I
did find a rather problematic place to start at... ;))
