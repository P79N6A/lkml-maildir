Hello!
I hope this is the right place for my request. I have heard about a VIA sytem timer bug.
I have a Via KX-133 (for athlon) board and the following problem:
Once the bug is triggered, the system timer goes crazy (i think it is the system timer, i am not sure). following things happen then: X blanks the screen all the time, licq auto-aways or auto-disconnects...
the bug is triggered by high disk throughput (copying large amounts of data from one hd to another) and it often occurs during open-gl.
I have heard, that there is a patch since 2.4.4-ac?, so i upgraded to 2.4.5, but the bug still occurs. do i have to set up something in make menuconfig? if so, what?
-regards, Jonas Diemer
