Martin,
Please don't post a omnibus SCSI subsystem patch like this.
Most of the code you are changing is actively maintained.
For example:
  - scsi mid-level + sr [Jens Axboe]
  - ppa [Tim Waugh]
  - sg  [me]
Some of us have grown attached to the way 'cat /proc/scsi/scsi'
looks. More importantly, many distributions have scripts that
parse it. GOTO Masanori's <gotom@debian.or.jp> suggestion of
of an exported scsi_device_types() seems a better option.
Also there are 32 SCSI device types (0 to 31) and perhaps
the "unknown"s and those that are missing could be replaced
by scsi_dev_<n> .
Also there is an appropriate newsgroup for this sort of
proposal and it is called: linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org
