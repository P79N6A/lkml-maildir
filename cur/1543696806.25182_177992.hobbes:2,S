I appreciate Arch and am actually using it for some things, and can't
give an educated opinion on BK as I have never used it.
But this is just ridiculous.
First of all, there always serious pain in switching. Whatever free
alternative is provided better be _a lot_ better compared to what is
currently used. And although Arch might be more in-line with the
political goals of many developers, frankly I don't believe Arch is
technologically there yet.
But then asking Larry to implement a gateway seems to be the plan of the
century. Hey why doesn't Larry help out with the Arch or SVN effort
while he's at it? How would you react if ClearCase started demanding
that Arch/SVN/CVS developers should implement a one-directional
gateway to their software to make it easier for people to migrate.
