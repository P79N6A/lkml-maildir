"When in doubt, always mount a scratch monkey"
I have a spare partition for this kind of tests, and I am happy to
report that a quick test this morning shows:
* the innd data corruption that started this whole thread appears
  to be solved;
* I could not trigger any data corruption by a simple
  "fire up mutt and delete some mails in the inbox" test.
Definitely needs additional testing, but so far it looks good.
