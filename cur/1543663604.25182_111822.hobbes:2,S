OK, so now you've slid from talking about PCs to 2-way to 4-way ...
perhaps because your original arguement was fatally flawed.
The work we're doing on scalablity has big impacts on 4-way systems
as well as the high end. We're also simultaneously dramatically improving
stability for smaller SMP machines by finding reproducing races in 
5 minutes that smaller machines might hit once every year or so, and 
running high-stress workloads that thrash the hell out of various 
subsystems exposing bugs.
Some applications work well on clusters, which will give them cheaper 
hardware, at the expense of a lot more complexity in userspace ... 
depending on the scale of the system, that's a tradeoff that might go 
either way. 
For applications that don't work well on clusters, you have no real
choice but to go with the high-end systems. I'd like to see Linux
across the board, as would many others.
You don't believe we can make it scale without screwing up the low end,
I do believe we can do that. Time will tell ... Linus et al are not 
stupid ... we're not going to be able to submit stuff that screwed up
the low-end, even if we wanted to.
