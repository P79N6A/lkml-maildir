Yes, discussion - I wouldnt mind seeing details.
The trivial part is st_blksize: all agree.
Quoting the man page:
       The value st_blksize gives the "preferred" blocksize
       for efficient file system I/O.  (Writing to a file in
       smaller chunks may cause an inefficient read-modify-rewrite.)
The nontrivial part is f_bsize. As far as I can see
BSD and SYSV and SUS all differ. And there are the use
in struct statfs and the use in struct statvfs that are
nonequivalent.
Maybe BSD f_iosize, f_bsize in statfs corresponds to
SYSV f_bsize, f_frsize in statfs. Linux is again a
bit different.
