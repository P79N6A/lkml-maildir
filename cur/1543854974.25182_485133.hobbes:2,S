Two points about solution using netfilter infrastructure:
1) Conntracks and dependant modules are called with the highest priority and 
will require, that skb context will be the same in input and output chains, 
else it will be a good place for bugs. So, we should change context before it 
will be marked by conntracks;
2) This solution has worse performance in comparison with Daniel's solution 
due to additional lookup of context by ip addr.
