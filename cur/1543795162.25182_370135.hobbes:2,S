event will be a bit field, not a sequential number.

Valid question. That is one of the reason of my posting this question.
I was planning to make the interface change to handle bitwise events
with zero being "all events". Future users will use the bitwise events. 
w.r.t existing users, i would change only the macros(that were listed)
and let the module owners do the change to the notifier blocks when they
want (or file a kernel janitor bug).
The object was to move towards optimization.
