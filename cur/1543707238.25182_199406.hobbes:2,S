For example:
append = "video=radeon:1024x768-32@100" works for 2.4.x
append = "video=radeonfb:1024x768-32@100 works for 2.6.x
but for new radeonfb _radeonfb_ in append won't work, my screean start with
small res on 36 Hz ;-) So I need to use fbset.
Besides don't use 2.6.x even on desktop, that was only a test with new
radeonfb from Ben H.
