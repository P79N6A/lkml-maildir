I had in mind something more like a list_splice_init() operation under
the lock, since it empties the entire list except in the case of
cache_reap(). For cache_reap(), not much could be done unless they were
organized into batches of (l3->free_limit+5*searchp->num-1)/(5*searchp->num)
such as a list of lists of that length, which would need to be
reorganized when tuning ->batchcount occurs.
It's not terribly meaningful since only grand reorganizations that are
presumed to stop the world actually get "sped up" without the additional
effort required to improve cache_reap(). My commentary was more about
the data structures being incapable of bulk movement operations for
batching like or analogous to list_splice() than trying to say that
drain_freelist() in particular should be optimized. Allowing movement of
larger batches without increased hold time in transfer_objects() is
clearly a more meaningful goal, for example.
Furthermore, the patch as written merely increases hold time in
exchange for decreased arrival rate resulting in no net improvement.
