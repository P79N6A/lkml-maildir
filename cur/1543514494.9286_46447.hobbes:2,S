Hi,
I've just compiled 2.3.24 and I've problems with nfsd and hfs : when I try to
load the modules, it reports unresolved symbols :
[root@debian-f5ibh] ~ # modprobe hfs
/lib/modules/2.3.24/fs/hfs.o: unresolved symbol update_vm_cache
/lib/modules/2.3.24/fs/hfs.o: insmod /lib/modules/2.3.24/fs/hfs.o failed
/lib/modules/2.3.24/fs/hfs.o: insmod hfs failed
[root@debian-f5ibh] ~ # modprobe nfsd
/lib/modules/2.3.24/fs/nfsd.o: unresolved symbol locks_mandatory_area
/lib/modules/2.3.24/fs/nfsd.o: unresolved symbol nfsd_fh_free
/lib/modules/2.3.24/fs/nfsd.o: insmod /lib/modules/2.3.24/fs/nfsd.o failed
/lib/modules/2.3.24/fs/nfsd.o: insmod nfsd failed
Is there any fix for that ?  The problem with nfsd came with 2.3.24, the
problem with hfs is an 'old' one (was existing a least on 2.3.23).
Regards
Jean-Luc
P.S. : avoid to tell me to write a patch myself, please. And, as Alan Cox said
to an other guy :  "How about being a bit more polite to someone who is just
asking for advice".
