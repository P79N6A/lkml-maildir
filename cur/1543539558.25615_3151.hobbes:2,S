Ok, what about just this simple little patch?
It gives the protection to systems that need it and can afford it, and
for those systems it's even safer.
That's because even using the 'non-killer' commands to the drive you can
hose the system rather easily (SETFEATURES, SETMULT, or just
STANDBY/SLEEP/STANDBY/SLEEP which would almost definitely overheat the
drive ...). This disables all raw commands to IDE drives if CAP_RAWIO
isn't present.
