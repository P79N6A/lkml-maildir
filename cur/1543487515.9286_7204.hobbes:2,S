I ran into something suspiciously similar to this today; the tulip.c
driver (version 0.90) in 100BaseT full-duplex mode would often deal
extremely poorly with the collisions that full-duplex mode brings
about. I would get runts, giants, and all sorts of nasty packet errors.
Forcing half-duplex mode solved the problem. I don't know if it's
a driver or hardware problem at this point, but I've never had
luck with any DEC-related ethernet cards. :)
