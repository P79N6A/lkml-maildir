Strictly speaking what you want then is not going to be at the
filesystem layer, since the filesystem layer doesn't generally see
seeks, writes, etc.
It sounds like you want to instrument the system calls, look at the
man pages for 'strace' and similar.

The ptrace system call and a little effort will let you do this.  You
can also use LD_PRELOAD and over-ride some glibc hooks for the file IO
operations --- there are plenty of things that do this I'm sure
already.
