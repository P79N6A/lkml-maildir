Hi Greg,

I checked against my own list of patches and found that I have two more,
which were posted to the sensors and kernel-janitors list in early
february:
http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg29340.html
http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg29342.html
They never made it to your own i2c tree, nor Andrew's tree. What do we
want to do with these?
Thanks,
