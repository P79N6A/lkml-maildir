Agreed, or it will cause a machine check if legacy I/O remapping isn't 
supported (like on SGI).

I'm not sure if broken is the right work.  All this stuff predates PCI by 
quite a bit, so certain device classes claimed certain port ranges way before 
cards were required to have programmable address decoders.  VGA cards are 
probably the most tenacious example of this, they respond to certain well 
known ports after reset, regardless of BAR values.

Not sure, the I/O BAR may correspond to real registers too--and they may not 
overlap with the ones in the well known space.

I think we might just need a new resource for these well known ports, if my 
last statement is true.

Yeah, I think I understand.  We could probably do the same thing on sn2 as you 
do on parisc--add a 'segment 0' offset to the port so that it's routed 
correctly.  I think that's a little less flexible than adding a new resource 
though, since it makes it harder for drivers to support more than one device 
or devices on non-segment 0 busses.
