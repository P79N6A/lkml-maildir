I tell you that the address_spaces are an _optional_ abstraction.  Thus
using the directly from generic code is a layering violation.  This layer
of indirection was added intentionally in 2.3, and if you want to get rid
of it again please submit a patch to Al to merge the aops back into the
inode_operations vector.  Otherwise I will cleanup the last remaining
violation of that layering rule in 2.5.

I am currently reviewing a patch from Jari Ruusu that does not only
get rid of the layering violation but also provides certain advantags
for the loop-AES crypto addon he wrote/maintains.  I doubt he would do
so it it kills performance for his application.  Neverless I must say
I don't care at all for performace of encrypted loop:  It's not merged,
and mainline correctness has a _much_ higher priority for me than
performance of external code.
You argue for performace at the cost of correctness.

Correctness and cleanness.

It could provide them just for the sake of loop.c's layering violation
to exist for a longer time.  Due to it's abuse of do_generic_file read
it would continue to have another problem.

If you think that the guarantee that every filesystem should be pagecache
backed is worth documenting (and adopting everything to it), feel free to
submit a patch for review.  I have stated above why it's not a good idea.
