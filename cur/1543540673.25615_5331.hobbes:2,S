You're right, the differences between FreeBSD VM and the new
Linux VM should be clearly indicated.

Indeed. The amount of documentation (books? nah..) on VM
is so sparse that it would be good to have both systems
properly documented. That would fill a void in CS theory
and documentation that was painfully there while I was
trying to find useful information to help with the design
of the new Linux VM...
