This is really unreasonable, I think that such a beast (a layer to allow
binary compatible drivers for those who want to write such drivers)
could be very usefull, I do agree that it should be very clean, and as
fast as possible. But demanding that it is written in such a way that
drivers using it can't cause any problems is totally unreasonable, even
if it was a driver interpreter (would solve platform independce) it
could still crash a machine, if the device it
controls locks up the bus.
I do completly agree that we should be very clear that questions from
users with a binary only driver will not be answered, and that they
should:
-reproduce the problem without that driver loaded
-if that fails take it up with the drivers maintainer
But demanding that a binary compatibility layer is written in such a way
that it is impossible to crash the system with a binary driver is
unfair, the driver is running ring 0 after all.
