I'd like to add my 2cents FWIW.
1) I don't believe it's hardware. I agree that too may people are seeing this
with different hardware.
2) I'm not so sure it's specific to any one driver.  I've been working on the
ES1371 driver for about a month now (this was also my first experience with
Linux and sound) and immediately noticed the problems described in this thread.
For me renicing didn't seem to do anything.
I'm trying to play around with things in the driver to see if they make any
difference.  If I come up with any useful information I'll post it.
Regards,
Joe C.
