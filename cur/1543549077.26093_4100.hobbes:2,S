	Nah...  It turned out to be something REALLY obvious.  I was
missing the joydev module.  Someone else already pointed it out to me.
The module isn't sitting in the /lib/modules/.../kernel/drivers/char/joystick
directory with the joystick drivers, it's over in the .../input/ directory
where I missed it.  :->
