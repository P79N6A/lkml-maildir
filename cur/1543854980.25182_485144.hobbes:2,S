You mean moving is like this:
old_bc = task->real_bc;
task->real_bc = new_bc;
cmpxchg(&tsk->exec_bc, old_bc, new_bc);
? Then this won't work:
Initialisation:
current->exec_bc = init_bc;
current->real_bc = init_bc;
...
IRQ:
current->exec_bc = init_bc;
...
                             old_bc = tsk->real_bc; /* init_bc */
                             tsk->real_bc = bc1;
                             cx(tsk->exec_bc, init_bc, bc1); /* ok */
...
Here at the middle of an interrupt
we have bc1 set as exec_bc on task
which IS wrong!
...
current->exec_bc =
        current->real_bc;
We need some way to be sure that task isn't running at
the moment we change it's beancounter. Otherwise we're
risking that we'll spoil some temporary context.
