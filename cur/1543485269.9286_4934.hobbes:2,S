Its looking at the local university where I manage the system's
administration team.  We have had 2.2.1 up for a little over a week on
a server which hosts our authenticated news server.  We are taking a
full feed on the box and haven't heard a thing out of it.
The box itself is a GW2K (ALR) NS8000 configured as such:
	Dual PII-300 (SMP 2.2.1)
	256 Mb RAM
	DPT-3334 (eata driver) (News spool on a 4x9Gbyte RAID0 stripe)
	Intel EEPRO11 (primary NIC)
	SMC Etherpower II (secondary NIC)
We have seen peak article ingress rates of up to 23 art/sec with an
average of 3-5/sec.
We have a pretty busy network on the primary side and as I said at
the outset the box has been troublefree.  The SMC Etherpower II's
can't stand up to load and will be coming out of this machine.  They
seem to be doing fine just handling backups on the secondary network.
We plan to begin moving our production servers and services to 2.2.2
as soon as it releases and checks out to be stable.  The 2.2 series
seems to have stabilized quite nicely.
