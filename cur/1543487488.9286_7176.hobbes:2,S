The strongarm has a -lot- of problems. Poor cache design , integer only ..
Yes its quite cheap (and the cirrus 7500FE is even cheaper if you only
need 33Mhz) but its constrained
If price and not performance is the real issue you go for uclinux right now,
for combination needs NatSemi/Cyrix have interesting options
