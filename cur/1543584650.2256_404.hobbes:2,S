Hi,
     I read the Intel IA-32 developer's manual recently, and I found
 the cache lines for L1 and L2 caches in Pentium4 are 64 bytes
 wide, but the thing make me confused is that the default value
 CONFIG_X86_L1_CACHE_SHIFT option in 2.4.x kernel is 7, why it's
 not 6?   Any expanation about this would be appreciated!
