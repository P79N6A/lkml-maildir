The current implementation of CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is a real snake pit.
I'm mildly curious how a %.ver file disappeared and left a %.stamp
in place.
For 2.2, I favor a more heavy-handed approach of killing the stamp
file optimization.  It has another outstanding bug: if the user changes
CONFIG_SMP or CONFIG_PROC_FS or certain other CONFIG_* variables, the
modversions signatures do change, but the stamp file check prevents
the %.ver file from getting recomputed.
