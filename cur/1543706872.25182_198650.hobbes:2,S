Sorry, but at this point I WOULD NOT EVEN TAKE IT ANY MORE.
That's just how I work: if somebody maintains his own tree and builds up a 
lot of patches, that's _his_ problem. I'm not going to replace things 
totally unless there is some really fundamental reason I would have to. 
And quite frankly, the most common "fundamental reason" is that the 
maintainer has not done his job.
I want controlled patches that do one thing at a time. Not a 2GB untested 
dump.

.. and once he has patches, he can't just "dump" them out, either.
These things need to be done in a timely fashion, incrementally, one thing 
at a time. Anything else does not work.
And btw, for anybody who is impacted by this: you are encouraged to help. 
If you have a machine that works with some out-of-tree code but does 
_not_ work with the in-tree code, send a patch that fixes JUST THAT BUG.
Because if James can't trickle them in, somebody else will have to. That's 
what happened with the new radeon driver.
