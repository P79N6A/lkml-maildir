as long as those makefiles inherit the proper CFLAGs it's no big deal.
If not then you need to glue them together properly, but thankfully the
GPL gives you the freedom to tinker with the sources you get so you can

just inherit the cflags. You need to have matching cflags and compiler
anyway for many other reasons; this one is no exception.
