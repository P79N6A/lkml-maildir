That´s also my feeling.
After having more and more performance loss (at least for my 
system/usage) and no real good solution in view to fix the problems at 
this location in the kernel, I would prefer to get this thing ripped of 
as soon as possible.
By now I do not see any gain with that piece of code (relative to 
process/interrupt distribution). And please don´t show me benchmarks - I 
know what I feel.
Userland would be first of all the right place to do any further testing.
And please - don´t tell me it´s that complicated to remove this piece of 
code from source tree.
Kai.
