Yes, I think your right, this is. At least, I've come across it before, but
I'm not convinced this is my problem in this case.
I think it's failing about 1GB before getting to the bottom of the
libraries, but I'm going to monitor maps over the weekend to ensure it
doesn't start doing anything wacky just before crashing.
