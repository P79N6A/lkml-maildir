core file is just dump of offending program memory (illegal instruction was
executed, null pointer was dereferenced, whatever). You can use it with
gdb (or equivalent) to track down problems in programs (if you are lucky
anyway :-) or you can send it to program authors for examination. In all
other cases they are harmless but meaningless and can be deleted (if you
are not interested in debugging you can turn off generation of core files
with ulimit)...
