There is no OOPS, which is good.

I see a lot of them.
my smb.conf:
character set = ISO8859-1
client code page = 850
But I think, that my local code page is actually 8859-15 (I have euro-support 
so it has to be 15)
Is that a problem? AFAIK the only difference between 1 and 15 is the 
Euro-sign.

The computer I mount has samba 2.0.7. But I don't know which code page it is 
running. If it is of interest I will ask.

I will try  that someday. If I had the choice I would introduce 4Byte Unicode 
for everthing and forbid everything else......

If I run a find over all shares I still get some rare:
smb_proc_readdir_long: name=directory\*, result=-13, rcls=1, err=5
and
smb_proc_readdir_long: name=directory\*, result=-2, rcls=1, err=2
messages. 
These directories are empty, as you posted above.
