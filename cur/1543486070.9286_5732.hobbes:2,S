From the standards standpoint, the following text applies to unlink()
when targetting a directory and to rmdir():
unlink():
  ...
    [EBUSY]  The directory named by the path argument cannot
             be unlinked because it is being used by the system
             or another process and the implementation considers
             this to be an error.
rmdir():
    [EBUSY]  The directory named by the path argument cannot be
             removed because it is being used by another process
             and the implementation considers this to be an error.
So, according to Posix (and by extension, the single unix specification), 
there are two choices:
        1) The implementation allows an existing directory with a 
           non-zero active reference count to be removed and returns
           a success indication, or
        2) The implementation returns EBUSY. 
Nothing else is allowed by the specifications for this condition. 
(The weasel wording is there to allow for the fact that some BSD
 implementations differed in the handling of rmdir from SYSV derived
 implementations - so both methods were standardized.   This does 
 in no way allow operating system implementors to invent a new 
 error code for an existing condition).

The standards would appear to mandate ENOENT for this condition:
from open(): (and by derivation, creat):
     [ENOENT]  ... O_CREAT is set and either the path prefix
               does not exist or the path argument points to an
               empty string. 
It is clear that after the current working directory has been removed
(on implementations which support such an operation), the path
prefix (implicitly './') does not exist and the operation should
return ENOENT, not EPERM.
While POSIX and the Single Unix Specification both allow additional
errno values to be returned for interfaces under conditions not 
specified, an implementation may not return an alternate error code
for a condition that has been specified to return a particular 
error code.
