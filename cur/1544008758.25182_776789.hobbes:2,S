> [PATCH] percpu_counter: Fix __percpu_counter_sum()
> 
> This function should not write into percpu local storage,
> without proper locking, or some changes done on other cpus
> might be lost.
> 
> Adding proper locking would need to use atomic
> operations in fast path and would be expensive.
> 
> Results of __percpu_counter_sum() can be wrong, this is a
> known fact.
> 
> We also dont need to acquire the lock, this gives
> no better results.
