I read it. I just didn't agree with the level of importance I felt you
were assigning to corporate use.

They should use what is best for them.

I think it's obvious you understand what Linus wrote. I think you
misunderstand the design focus of the Linux kernel.

I don't believe he ever stated that he wanted to do that.

It would be more accurately to say that he's creating a GPLed Unix
compatible kernel which utilizes the best (in his unhumble
opinion) available technologies while remaining reasonably compatible. The
strongest development direction appears to be towards long-term
sustainability and stability (vs short term) and a focus on features that
are usable today (vs experimental stuff).

None of those are necessarily bad things.
I think Linuses design decisions will pay off in the long run. When the
race has no ending line, who cares if you have a slower start.

I certainly hope you didn't see my response as hostile. It certainly wasn't
intended to be that way.
