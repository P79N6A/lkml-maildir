This patch introduces a locking hierarchy between the lo->tx_lock and
lo->queue_lock. The existing driver does not have this limitation.
I would feel a lot better about this patch if you were to recode it
to avoid this.
Also, I noticed that you've removed the forcible shutdown of the
socket at the end of NBD_DO_IT. Was there a particular reason for
that?

It would be really nice if the driver remained (as much as
possible) compatible with the 2.4 version...unless you have
a really good reason to break things... :)
