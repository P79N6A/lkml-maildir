Depends on the implementation.  If the item in the queue is the
struct file (or whatever an fd indexes to), then the implementation
can only queue the fd once.  This also avoids the problem with
closing sockets - close() would naturally do a list_del() or whatever
on the struct file.
At least I think it could be implemented this way...
