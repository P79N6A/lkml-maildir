OK, I have read the code once again, and saw that you have special
handling within PS/2 protocol based on model constant. Please set
psmouse type to PSMOUSE_TRACKPOINT instead of model and provide full
protocol handler, like ALPS, Synaptics and Logitech do. Trackpoint
is different and complex enough to warrant it.
