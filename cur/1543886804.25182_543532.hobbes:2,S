Let me explain it one more time:
 - shouldn't the *caller* protect this?
Afaik, there's two situations:
 - either things don't change (in which case you don't need locking at 
   all, since things are statically one way or the other)
 - or things change (in which case the caller can't rely on the return 
   value anyway, since they might change *after* you release the lock)
ie what's up? Is there a third case?
