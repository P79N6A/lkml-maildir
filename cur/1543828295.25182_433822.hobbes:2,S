The printk means you're getting more IRQs than would be good.
Did you apply any patches to this, e.g. from the MM tree?
An alternative (but post-boot) workaround _should_ be
    echo disabled > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.0/power/wakeup
Looks like this is an old ALI-based motherboard with only one USB
controller; this might be a hardware problem, some others from
that era had problems handling USB suspend states.  In your case
(no USB devices hooked up here, right?) maybe this problem can
be automagically detected and worked around.
What would be most useful in this case -- and is ISTR one of
the FAQs for "how to report USB problems" -- is rebuilding
with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG and sending the boot log, so I can see
how that OHCI controller comes up in more detail than you've
provided here.
