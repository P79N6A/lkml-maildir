Im gradually feeding Donalds new stuff into 2.2.x over time. Mostly it works
out (the rtl8139 was updated a few releases ago). The tulip will be in 2.2.14
though we have some minor funnies with some users and theres an old_tulip.c as
well (alas)
The latest drivers there are some pci/cardbus support logic bits to get sorted
out but that is the big job that should sort things out
