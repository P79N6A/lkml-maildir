I freely admit to being something of a neophyte when it comes to the 
internal details of the Linux kernel. I've been successfully running 
development and test kernels since 2.5.40 or so, and I've never before 
seen anything like the following:

The above messages appeared in a root terminal running from Gnome, while 
I was outside replacing fuses in my truck. Given that my truck is not 
yet running Linux or connected to my network (give me time...), I'm at a 
loss as to what caused the above, and what it means.
Polite illumination will be most graciously appreciated.
