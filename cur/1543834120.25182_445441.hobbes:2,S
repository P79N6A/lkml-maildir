Journalling costs performance at the price of added I/O.

Dynamic parameters?  Probably not.  If you *really* care about performance,
you put the journal on a different physical drive (and maybe controller) than
the actual filesystem itself.  From 'man mkfs.ext3':
       -J journal-options
	...
	                   device=external-journal
                          Attach  the  filesystem  to the journal block device
                          located on external-journal.  The  external  journal
                          must already have been created using the command
                          mke2fs -O journal_dev external-journal
