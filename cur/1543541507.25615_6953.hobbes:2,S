Good. How about the following implementation of your fd_open():
	mount(name, tmp, "ntfork", 0, NULL);
	sprintf(tmpname, "%s/%s", tmp, field);
	fd = open(tmpname, ......);
	return fd;
Yep, requires umount(). But notice that this way we
	* don't need any magic syscalls
	* avoid all questions about out-of-file renaming, etc.
	* don't have to do _any_ VFS changes - it's all there.
	* let the userland decide (and explicitly tell us) what it wants.
And yes, I mean making that case of mount() user-available.
Comments? I can implement that for HPFS (EAs) in a day or two. As the
matter of fact, I would _really_ like to do that for _HFS_ - that would
allow to drop tons of ugly code there.
