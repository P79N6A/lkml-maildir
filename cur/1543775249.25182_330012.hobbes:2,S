Can't comment on git slowing things down, but I have to think that the 
time it took, and was ALLOWED to take, is a result of the -stable fixes 
working very well indeed. The fact that the 2.6.11.X was available to 
take the presure off to get something out of the door.
My big thank you to the stable folks, I personally think this idea is 
working as intended.
