While I agree that -aa (or -rmap -- something to rescue the VM) should
go in ASAP, applying O(1) is a little more questionable.  I've been
applying O(1) for a while with great results, but it could be construed
as changing significantly the behavior of a stable kernel series.  I
don't know if it does, but I can see it breaking certain apps or modules
that relied on previous behavior.  Kind of like that parent vs. child
scheduling issue of a few months ago.  But I could be all wet on that.
It should be in it's own release separate from other major changes at
least, IMHO, if the backport is desired by enough folk to outweigh the
largish change.  And I definitely have VM _way_ higher up my personal
list. :)
