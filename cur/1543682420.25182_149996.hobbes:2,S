Subject: [2.6.0-test1-mm2] unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)

Hello ML,
I can't boot my 2.6.0-test1-mm2 kernel (+GCC 3.3). The kernel panics
at bootime:
VFS: Cannot open root device "hda3" or unknow-block(0,0)
Please append a correct "root=" boot option
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
I do have compiled support for the file system on my root partition
(xfs). The same configuration worked well with 2.6.0-test1-mm1.
Perhaps somebody knows how to solve this.
TIA
	Florian Huber
