What I think we need is an async call that takes:
 - an opaque blob with the error informations and accessors (see my
reply to Jeff)
 - a slot state (slot isolated, slot has been reset, slot has IOs /DMA
enabled/disabled, must probably be a bitmask)
 - a bit mask of possible actions the driver can request (nothing, reset
slot, re-enable IOs, ...)
I'm afraid tho that the combinatory explosion will make it difficult to
drivers to deal with the right thing. Maybe we can simplify the mecanism
to archs that can just 1) re-enable IOs, 2) reset slot.
Note that the reason to re-enable IOs before trying to reset the slot is
that some devices will allow you to extract diagnostic informations, and
it's always useful to gather as much informations as possible upon an
error of this type.
