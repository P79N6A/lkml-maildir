Not sure what exactly you mean by inter-thread communication, whether
communication between threads within one process or between threads from
different processes.  You can use mq_* for either, except that mq_notify
registered signal notification is sent to the process that called mq_notify,
not thread (and for SIGEV_THREAD a new thread is created).
Though of course for communication between threads within one process
mq_* is a huge overkill.

No, glibc supports mq_* APIs for more than 3 years now.
