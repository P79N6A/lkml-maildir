Is it?  Shouldn't these be "allowsuid", "noallowsuid", "allowexec",
"noallowexec"?
See, we mentally add the "allow" quite easily.

Well, to the user they are always in the form "user=123" and
"usermnt", so they are not as easy to confuse.
But I feel a bit stupid bickering about this, because it isn't so
important.  "allowuser" or "allowusermnt" are fine by me if you think
they are substantially better than "usermnt".
