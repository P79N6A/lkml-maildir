Subject: [PATCH 0/2] KVM: Sync with -mm tree
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are a couple of patches I've neglected to send out and are 
thus not in -mm.  One clarifies the KVM license and the other makes enum 
values explicit.
Merging them will sync my current release tree to -mm, which will help 
avoid fuzz in the event we have to merge a large patchset.
