Well, for general consumption, the patch.
After patching there is a file called 'move-drivers' in
/drivers. Please run it so the actual drivers are moved
to their proper location.
The patch itself consists mainly of changing the
required Config.in and Makefile files.
Oh, I added 'source drivers/media/Config.in' to
every arch which already contained drivers/char,
since that is where these drivers come from afterall.
