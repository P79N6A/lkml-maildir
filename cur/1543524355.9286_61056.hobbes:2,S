Hello,
I'm facing a problem in FTP reception problem with a new synchronous card
driver (the Cyclades-PC300 driver), but I've just found out something at
least interesting.
If I do FTP _transmissions_ , no problems happen.
If I do FTP _receptions_ , at high speeds (e.g. 4Mbps) and using big files
(e.g. 10MB) the system crashes hard, with an oops report that's evidently
corrupted:
Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0d841801
 printing eip:
0d841801
*pde = 00000000
Oops: 0000

Call Trace:
Code: <1>Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address

*pde = 00000000
The stack has really weird values, and no call / code trace is reported.
Now, the interesting part: if I do FTP receptions _but_ I redirect the
incoming file to /dev/null (i.e., I don't write the file to the IDE HD,
just receive it through the line and save it as /dev/null), no crashes
happen whatsoever !!!
Also, if I replace the IDE HD by a SCSI HD, running in the same system, no
crashes happen whatsoever.
I've tested this in both a P166 / 32MB RAM and in a Dual PII-400 / 128MB
RAM. In the Dual PII, the problem takes longer to happen, but nevertheless
it does happen.
Furthermore, I tested it in kernels 2.2.14 / 2.2.15pre5, and the problem
does NOT happen. It happens in kernels 2.3.40 / 2.3.40pre4 / 2.3.41. 
Again:
- The problem does not happen in the latest 2.2.x kernels.
- The problem _always_ happens when the IDE HD is used and the file from
  the FTP reception transfer is written to the HD.
- The problem _never_ happens when the IDE HD is used and the file from
  the FTP reception transfer is written to /dev/null.
- The problem _never_ happens when the SCSI HD is used in any test 
  scenario (i.e., writing or not to the HD).
Can anybody give some suggestions on where I should look at in order to
try and solve this problem?? Any help would be highly apreciated. If you
need to look at the PC300 driver source code, please let me know and I can
send it to you.
TIA and Regards,
Ivan
