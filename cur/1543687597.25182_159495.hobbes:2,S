First at least the comment on top of xfs_lowbit64() is not correct.
ffs() only handles an 32bit argument, not 64bit. Hope that isn't a problem.
Hmm, one difference is that the x86-64 ffs will return 32 on zero, while
i386 returns -1.
Does this patch fix it?

If that doesn't help I would also try it with -O1 and possibly a different compiler
(e.g. gcc 3.2 if you're using 3.3 or the other way round) to rule out a compiler problem
