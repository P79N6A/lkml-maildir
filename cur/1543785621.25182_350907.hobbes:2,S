For file descriptors, even a few hundred is considered a _lot_ in almost 
all settings. Yes, you can certainly have more, but it's unusual.
And we keep track of the fd reservations with a bitmap _and_ a "lowest
possible" count. So we can check 32 fd's in one go (64 on modern setups),
starting from the last one we allocated.
In other words, no. It's not worth doing anything more than we already do. 
I bet all the expense in this area tends under heavy load to be the
cacheline bouncing of the updates. Keeping the lock close to the bitmap is 
probably advantageous, since the bitmap tends to be looked at only when we 
need to change them (and we hold the lock).
