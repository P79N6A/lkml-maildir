We have had (do have?) several cases of optional "this workaround", or
"that workaround" as per-hardware config options.  If this is that
objectionable for genral consumption then someone ought to submit a
patch to do the dirty deed but put it in as a configurable workaround
(CONFIG_TURNFLOPPYOFF=Y/N), and leave it at that. [For maximum
perversity, it could also be a MODULE.] This does not affect everyone
right?  I have never tried booting w/o the floppy module, so I really
don't know about my system.
