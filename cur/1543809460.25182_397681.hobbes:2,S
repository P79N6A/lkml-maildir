Yes, this does look funny :P
However, this is the piece of code that I don't put in in order to make 
the debugger work, and it doesn't exist on the vanilla 2.6.16-rc kernel 
anymore.
What I did try to do was to add the:
-           if ((tsk->ptrace & (PT_DTRACE|PT_PTRACED)) == PT_DTRACE)
-                   goto clear_TF;
condition to the 2.6.16-rc kernel, but that didn't work anyway :(
