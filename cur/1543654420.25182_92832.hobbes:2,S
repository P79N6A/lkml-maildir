Subject: [PATCH] scsi/hosts.c device_register fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Many scsi hosts do scsi_register, and when the corresponding
host is not found or fails to work, do scsi_unregister again.
Thus, actions in scsi_unregister should be the inverses of those
in scsi_register, just like actions in scsi_remove_host should be
the inverses of those in scsi_add_host.
However, device_register() is done in scsi_add_host() while the
corresponding device_unregister() is done in scsi_unregister().
This causes crashes at boot (in 2.5.49 and 2.5.50).
Below a fix. This patch was first given by James Bottomley.
