There are?  I thought I fixed most of them.
*general sigh*.  I wish people would absorb CodingStyle.  It's not hard,
and fixing the style post-facto creates a real mess.  I now have a great
string of kexec patches followed by a "kexec-code-cleanup.patch" which
totally buggers up the patch sequencing and really needs to be split into
18 parts and sprinkled back over the entire series.

Yes, there will be a few problems I guess.  But people are testing it - we
know, because we've had lots of bug reports which were actually due to
greg-pci breakage...
