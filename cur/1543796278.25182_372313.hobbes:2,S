Yes, I know type checking and auto increment. But they are not
worthwhile, at least not for serious C programming. No, I don't know
how to use them comfortably.
What's wrong with sorted macros? They are more flexible and readable.
enums just look weird. We also share macros b/w C and asm.
You words on language and preprocessor doesn't make any sense.
It's not a feature of the preprocessor, it's what cpp is for. Look, I
call it Cpp. Without this `feature', what would a C preprocessor do?
You've castrated cpp.
Follow you logic, C standard should only specify C language, not
anything of libc...  I have no interest in arguing the relations b/w C
and cpp.

You contradict yourself rather.
