Thanks a lot for the wonderful explanation. I've already read some of
the T13 proposals, and wasn't sure what exactly they finalized on.
Also, I have the feeling at least my BIOS only uses the CRC errors to
switch to the appropriate UDMA mode - because it selects UDMA 16.6
mode on a too-long 40-wire cable instead of UDMA 33.
That'd probably explain why the VIA chipsets don't have any (documented)
means of detecting the 80-wire cable presence.
