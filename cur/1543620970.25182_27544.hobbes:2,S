Could you do this?  I'd prefer if task_info could be completely hidden
inside the x86/sparc arch-specific code, but if things are set up such
that we at least have the option to keep the stack, task_info, and
task_struct in a single chunk of memory (and without pointers between
them), I'd have much less of an issue with it.
