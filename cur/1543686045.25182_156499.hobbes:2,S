A few comments on why I don't like this patch:
    1) It's a formatting only patch.  That screws over people who are using
       BK for debugging, now when I double click on these changes I'll get
       to your cleanup patch, not the patch that was the last substantive
       change.
    2) "if (expr) statement;" really ought to be considered legit coding style.
       It's a one line "shorty" and it lets you see more of the code on a 
       screen.
    
On the other hand, the author carried things too far when they did
	if (expr) statement;
	else	  statement;
that's too hard for your eyes to parse quickly IMO.
