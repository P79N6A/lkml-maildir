Any interrupt causes the return address to be pushed onto the
stack. This will overwrite any data you've put there. In principle,
in user-mode, you can write below the stack-pointer because an
interrupt uses the kernel stack. However, your data will still
get corrupted by signal delivery, etc. So as to not corrupt your
user-mode stack, the kernel calls your signal code, just like
a nested call. This means the new return address will be below
the non-signal user-mode stack-pointer value. This will surely
corrupt anything you have written below the stack-pointer.
