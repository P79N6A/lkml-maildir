Hello
I tried to determine which line of make menuconfig should be ticked up
to get /dev/parport0.
devices.txt say
 99 char        Raw parallel ports
                  0 = /dev/parport0     First parallel port
                  1 = /dev/parport1     Second parallel port
parport.txt doesn't contain the word "raw". I also didn't find
anything that would discuss the problematics of raw parallel ports
in parport.txt
Suggestion #1: add information about raw parport access into parport.txt
Suggestion #2: add information to which make menuconfig entry the
raw parallel ports correspond into devices.txt file.
