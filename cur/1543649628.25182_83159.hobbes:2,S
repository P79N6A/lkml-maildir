I've no idea whether smcc-ircc2 is (already) meant to compile with 2.5.
However, when compiling stuff outside of an official 2.5.3x or later 
kernel tree I've experienced the same problem. For me the solution was to 
add the arch-specific asm-include explicitly in the Makefile - i.e. try 
adding some "-I/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/mach-generic" or similar there.
