It's so unusual, that I regularly find buggy code checking for NULL
instead of MAP_FAILED.  Just about every program I look at has it wrong
in at least one place.
Ditto for the result value from wait() -- lots of code fails to use
the fancy macros required for correct interpretation of it.

I think that's a bit harsh.  But yes, compared to core parts
of the kernel perhaps (eg. page dirty mappings: remember the recent bugfix?).
The real deal is that using zero/NULL makes it *easier* to get the code right.
And we certainly have tons more people working on drivers than anything else,
so making it *easier* for those coders to reduce the bug count is a Good Thing(tm).
Cheers
