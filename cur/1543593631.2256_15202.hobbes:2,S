Actually, I think your original message was useful.  It has
spurred a reevaluation of some design assumptions implicit in the VM
in the 2.4 series and has also surfaced some bugs.  It was not you
who I felt was sending enflammatory remarks, it was the folks who
have been bellyaching about the current swap disk space requirements
without offering any new information to help developers remedy
the situation.
So, thanks for bringing the topic up.  :-)
Cheers,
