These are fine-sounding words, but this is not the intent of, for
example, the GPL, which intentionally accomodates the needs of commerce.
If it didn't - i.e., no provision for closed apps on the GPL operating
system - you can be sure that Linux would not have grown as it has.
What we're really discussing is whether we're willing to allow patent
restrictions to inhibit the growth of Linux in new areas that go beyond
its traditional IT role, and further, whether we're willing to accept
such restrictions from people or companies that depend on Linux for
their sustenance, and who have benefitted from the lack of such
restrictions as they wish to impose on others.
