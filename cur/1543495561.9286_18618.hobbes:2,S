I always create a single 128MB swap file, no matter how much RAM the
machine is. On large machines, you probably want to avoid all swapping for
performance reasons, so you just carry a little bit for bleed-over. On
small machines, you don't need a swapfile that's more than, say, 4 times
larger than RAM because you're not going to run anything huge.
