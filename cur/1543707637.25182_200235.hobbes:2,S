That's not possible at the moment. What you want to do relies on the
feature that the mount command itself does the required setup. The would
require to have some dedicated C code fot the device setup and make
mount use that (through a patch). mount currently only knows about the
loop device. And BTW the key management sucks if you use an unpatched
mount because it uses the unhashed passphrase unhashed key.
