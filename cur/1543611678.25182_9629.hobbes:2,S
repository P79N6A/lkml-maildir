Fantastic!  I was working on something similar in my spare time too, but it
wasn't complete yet.  Good job!
Would you be interested in setting up a kdist-like list to email out the
changelog, diffstat, and incremental patch too as a product of the patch
generation script?  That would increase the usefulness of comments like
"Alan - much merging" in the changelogs.  Also, a script to update a web
page ala www.bzimage.org would make patch browsing really easy.  I volunteer
to help if you like.
Thanks,
Matt
