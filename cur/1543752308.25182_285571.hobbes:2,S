You should go through your x86-64-bugs mailbox ;-)   I've sent two
"hacks" your way, with explanation.  It is not nice to have node_online_map
to initialize with '1', then your nodes are #1 and #2 instead of #0 and
#1, and as node #0 has no memory and is not online at all, things broke.
Plus k8topology is broken too.
