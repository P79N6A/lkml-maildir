This is very strange, because my Linux server has never had a
lockd (it has always run the userland NFS server), and yet I see
error messages ("no locks available") each time the Sendmail on
the Solaris host tries to deliver a mail to a file on the Linux
box:
May 22 18:51:53 sunbox sendmail[19043]: AAA21937: to=/linuxbox/user/.mail-backup, ctladdr=<user@domain.com> (537/101), delay=2+18:34:49, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=*file*, stat=Operating system error
May 22 18:51:53 sunbox sendmail[19171]: XAA20894: SYSERR(user): cannot lockf(/linuxbox/user/.mail-backup, fd=16, type=2, omode=37777777777, euid=537): No record locks available
May 22 18:51:53 sunbox sendmail[19171]: XAA20894:  16: fl=0x9, mode=100644: size=654362
(I am conscious, in any case, that the absence of proper locking creates
an unsafe situation, but this is not the issue at stake.)
