No, stock x86_64 kernel is horribly unstable running UML.  I haven't seen
anything but output-free hangs, so I haven't had much information to 
contribute.  Antoine is actually getting capturable oopses.
I've tried every recent FC3 kernel, plus stock 2.6.10, and none of them
survive very long with UML running.  Haven't tried stock 2.6.11 or anything
later yet.
