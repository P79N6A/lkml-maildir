I wanted to report that my via82xx chip requires dxs_support=1 (VIA_DXS_ENABLE) to work without hissing or clicking, so that this info can be added to the 
whitelist.
The audio device is:
00:11.5 Class 0401: 1106:3059 (rev 50)
        Subsystem: 1297:a232
00:11.5 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. AC97 Audio Controller (rev 50)
        Subsystem: Holco Enterprise Co, Ltd/Shuttle Computer: Unknown device a23
Please cc me if more info is required as I'm not subscribed to this list.
