Maybe if they did, someone could design something actually drinkable from  
that ... then again, the result would be so different, one might as well  
start from scratch. And nobody seems interested anyway (or else someone  
*would* have started from scratch and produced something that doesn't try  
to be a very close clone).
And I'm probably not interested enough to make ot a commercial success  
anyway, even if everybody were like me.
