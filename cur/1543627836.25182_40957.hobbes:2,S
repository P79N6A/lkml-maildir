What about "target"?  In SCSI land, it's clear that a target is the device,
and when you talk about code that runs on a computer and makes it be a 
SCSI target, everyone knows what you mean, right?  So what about code that
makes a computer a USB target?  Would that work?  That's the only thing I
could think of that was similar.  Does USB already use the term target for
something else?
