2.5.50 hung when copying 800M.
mke2fs on a 10G partition, then try to copy
the entire /home there. Source and destionation
was on the same disk. After a while, this happened:
EIP: wake_up_forked_process+0xb8/0x18c
EAX: 5a5a5a5a   (suspicious)
trace:

kernel_thread
pdflush
kernel_thread_helper
start_one_pdflush_thread

The machine has 512M ram. It is a pentium IV 2.4GHz.
The kernel is compiled with smp (hoping for hyperthreading
but it haven't happened yet), preempt, devfs support (but
devfs isn't mounted anywhere currently) and IDE driver
for the SIS 5513.  
Both filesystems are ext2. The machine was in
single-user mode at the time.  I can reliably
reproduce this if a more detailed oops 
will help in debugging. I have 2G of swap space
on another IDE drive.
compiled with gcc 2.95.4 from debian testing
ide controller:
00:02.5 IDE interface: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 5513 [IDE]
I'm using dma, irq unmasking, 32-bit io and multiple 
sector transfers.
