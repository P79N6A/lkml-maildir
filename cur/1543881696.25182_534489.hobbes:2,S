Also, things like:
    share_mem /usr/bin/firefox r,        # /bin/foo can share memory with /usr/bin/firefox for read only
clearly show that you aren't using native abstractions for IPC. The 
native abstraction for shared memory would be the key used when creating 
the shared memory segment. The same goes for message queues which are 
noticeably missing from the "simplified" IPC model.
This, of course, begs the question of whether you are using native 
abstractions for profiles at all, processes have nothing to do with the 
binary they started from after they've been started. The binary on disk 
could be something entirely different than the process from which it ran.
