Hi all,
unfortunately I have to correct me again.
The problem seems unrelated to the kernel version or SMP/UP
(though only 2.4.[34] tried yet).
Apparently it's a reiserfs/symlink problem.
I tried doing the lndir on an ext2 partition, sources still
on reiserfs. And it worked just fine!
Sorry for the rather large amount of noise, I hope it's
finally correct now :)
