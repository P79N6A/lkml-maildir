Hi All,
We have recently acquired a Kyocera network printer and, being
the hackers we are, we tried to telnet to it (on various ports).
These telnet sessions to ports the printer is not listening on
hang.  The ouput from tcpdump looks like this:
[10.61.2.20 is the printer]
# tcpdump -v -v -v -n -x -s 1600 -p host 10.61.2.20
tcpdump: listening on eth0
11:28:41.458319 10.61.2.4.2823 > 10.61.2.20.23: S 998971063:998971063(0) win 32120 <mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 92454381 0,nop,wscale 0> (DF) [tos 0x10] (ttl 64, id 59900)
                         4510 003c e9fc 4000 4006 381e 0a3d 0204
                         0a3d 0214 0b07 0017 3b8b 16b7 0000 0000
                         a002 7d78 912d 0000 0204 05b4 0402 080a
                         0582 bded 0000 0000 0103 0300
11:28:41.460838 10.61.2.20.23 > 10.61.2.4.2823: R 0:16(16) ack 998971063 win 0 (ttl 64, id 12044)
                         4500 0038 2f0c 0000 4006 3323 0a3d 0214
                         0a3d 0204 0017 0b07 0000 0000 3b8b 16b7
                         5014 0000 1a77 0008 706f 7274 2075 6e61
                         7661 696c 6162 6c65
So, are we mishandling the reset, or is the printer sending rubbish,
or is there nothing we can do in this situation?  It would seem that
it would be nice if the connection did not hang (nmap has problems :-))
but can we reliably get out of this situation?
Cheers,
Stephen
