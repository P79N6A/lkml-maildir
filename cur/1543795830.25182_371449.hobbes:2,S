The nobody cared error message is reported when a device is raising interrupts while
the actual driver has not yet registered the interrupt handler.
The best way to handle this for network drivers (done in rt2x00, which works fine) would be:
1 - Allocate DMA
2 - Registers interrupt handler
3 - Enable device interrupts.
