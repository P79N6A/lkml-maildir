Thanks, but doesn't hdparm do the same thing?
As I wrote, hdparm -S 0 succeeded but the drive
spinned down after that. :-(
BTW, is is right what the hdparm manpage writes
about the spindown settings?

I should have been written capability "value" not "mask".
My program writes this value it gets from the kernel in hex
and in a human readable way.
The value it wrote was 0xfff on 2.2.x, 0x3ffff on 2.3.15
and 0x1fef on 2.3.16 on the same drive. (The Toshiba one.)

You may be right. I did not read ide-cd.c et.al.,
would you please enlighten me which techniques you use
to find out the correct capabilities of a drive
if it misreports them?

Hmm, the comments in cdrom.h tell that this change
was in 2.1.x, the cd player application in question (cdp)
works in 2.2.x. But I will look at its code deeper.
Thanks for the quick answer.
