I think that that is a truth with some major modification.  Linux has
been running just fine on bigendian architectures (m68k, mipseb,
sparc) for quite a while without problems.  Yes, if you're the first
to use a specific driver on a new arch you might have some minor
problems, but that's not limited to endianness.
So Linux will work just fine on either endianness.
