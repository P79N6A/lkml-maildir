Plus the fourth "leave it be" option, which I guess you're voting against.
Of those options, I'd go for something like Matthew's patch to add a new
layer-punching hook.  (I'll look at his latest tomorrow, and do something
appropriate with it.)
It's interesting that there was no evident motion on these network PM
issues after the OLS (and then netdev) discussion last summer ... but
there is now much more active discussion.  Evidently PM issues are still
ignored until a fire gets set.
