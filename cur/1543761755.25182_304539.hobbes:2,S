Well, and you want to compile all this into the kernel? Just to hold the
hands of users who have not read the fine manual?
And you'd need to compile this into all kernels, especially those that
_don't_ support suspend to disk. Or you are back at the place where the
thread started.

GRUB reads kernel and initramfs from a dirty reiserfs partition on
resume (although this is a bad idea if you want a fast resume, but
that's another problem). It is possible.

This is the final argument for doing it in userspace :-).

It does not help if the next kernel i boot is not suspend2 patched. This
work should rather go into a library that exports this functions to
userspace programs, for all known suspend implementations.
