hello again,
thanks for all the helpful replies. since it seems to be stable
and reasonably well established, the department have decided to go
for it.
it also got *me* thinking.
i was just about to upgrade my own system to a PII-400/450. however,
now i've looked into it i noticed that i could get a dual PII-333
for not much more than a single PII-400.
would this be a better bet?
what are the pros and cons?
maybe it would be better for people to reply directly to me since this
is not really a kernel topic.
keith.
