But perhaps you have /etc/mtab a link to /proc/mounts ?
Then it is clear that the refcnt will go up, and nothing is wrong.
mount will do the losetup for you if you say `-o loop'.
umount will do the losetup -d for you if it knows that a loop
device was setup by mount, and that information is found in /etc/mtab.
That is one of the reasons why /etc/mtab should not be a link to /proc/mounts.
