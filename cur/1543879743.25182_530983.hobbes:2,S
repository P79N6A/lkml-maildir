yes, that's precisely what i did, via a patchset :)
[ I can even tell you when it all started: i was thinking about Mike's
  throttling patches while watching Manchester United beat the crap out
  of AS Roma (7 to 1 end result), Thuesday evening. I started coding it
  Wednesday morning and sent the patch Friday evening. I very much
  believe in low-latency when it comes to development too ;) ]
(if this had been done via a comittee then today we'd probably still be 
trying to find a suitable timeslot for the initial conference call where 
we'd discuss the election of a chair who would be tasked with writing up 
an initial document of feature requests, on which we'd take a vote, 
possibly this year already, because the matter is really urgent you know 
;-)

ok, let me make this absolutely clear: i didnt use any bit of plugsched 
- in fact the most difficult bits of the modularization was for areas of 
sched.c that plugsched never even touched AFAIK. (the load-balancer for 
example.)
Plugsched simply does something else: i modularized scheduling policies 
in essence that have to cooperate with each other, while plugsched 
modularized complete schedulers which are compile-time or boot-time 
selected, with no runtime cooperation between them. (one has to be 
selected at a time)
(and i have no trouble at all with crediting Will's work either: a few 
years ago i used Will's PID rework concepts for an NPTL related speedup 
and Will is very much credited for it in today's kernel/pid.c and he 
continued to contribute to it later on.)
(the tree walking bits of sched_fair.c were in fact derived from 
kernel/hrtimer.c, the rbtree code written by Thomas and me :-)
