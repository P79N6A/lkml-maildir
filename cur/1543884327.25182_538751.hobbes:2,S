I just checked my logs, and it appears my workload didn't trigger this one 
Mike.  And so far, v8 is working great here.  And that great is in my 
best "Tony the Tiger" voice, stolen shamelessly from the breakfast cereal tv  
commercial of 30+ years ago. :)
Ingo asked for a 0-100 rating, where 0 is mainline as I recall it, and 100 is 
the best of the breed.  I'll give this one a 100 till something better shows 
up.
