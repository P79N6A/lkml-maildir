Hi,
I'm using kernel threads in my driver & they work fine however I'm getting
left with zombie processes when they
exit. As I have no parent process calling wait. I've tried attaching making
init my parent process this doesn't
appear to help.
The new daemonize function in 2.3 doesn't fix this problem.
I'm currently thinking of adding a PF_NOZOMBIE flag to the process flags
which releases the
process immeadiately instead of calling exit_notify in do_exit in exit.c
I could just have 1 kernel thread running all the time but this would still
be a zombie when the module is removed.
Have any of you any opinions suggestions or alternatives on this course of
action.
Thanks,
