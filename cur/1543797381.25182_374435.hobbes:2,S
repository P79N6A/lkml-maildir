Readability improved: good.
37 lines of patch for 80-100 bytes saved: not so good.
So while this is a good style direction, I don't think it's worth the
churn. And unlike kzalloc and the like, this particular optimization
is perfectly doable by a compiler. So I'd rather wait for the compiler
to get smarter than change code for such modest improvements.
FYI, much other low-hanging size-reduction fruit remains in the
kernel. Lots of it in the form of duplicate code.
