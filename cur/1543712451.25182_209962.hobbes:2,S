more specifically
/usr/include/linux/byteorder/swab.h
/usr/include/asm-i386/byteorder.h
are broken, as in throwing errors when used to compile programs and
causing make to exit error 1 
browsing the net, plenty of people have had this problem.
i replaced the broken headers with equivalent ones from 2.4.19 and those
were broken too.
that leads me to believe that this is an old problem
anybody have a 2.6.4 patch for those files?
