	I have grep'd the kernel for all occurences of rtattr_failure
and nlmsg_failure, and there are no more skb_put()s than those two
(hmm, legacy protocols which no-one uses, such as Decnet or IPv4 :-).
However, the same problem is in 2.4, so please push these fixes to
Marcelo as well.

 Any compiler or language that likes to hide things like memory allocations
 behind your back just isn't a good choice for a kernel.   --Linus Torvalds
