Subject: [BUG] 2.6.18-rc6: hda is allready "IN USE" when booting (non-deterministic)

Hello,
i keep hitting this since 2.6.18-rc3, the imo relevant messages are:
ide0: I/O resource 0x3F6-0x3F6
hda: ERROR, PORTS ALREADY IN USE
ide0 ad 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
hdb: HL-DT-STDVD-ROM GDR8081N, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
ide1: I/O resource 0x376-0x376 not free
ide0: ports already in use, skipping probe
register_blkdev: cannot get major 3 for ide0
the probablity for this is about 70%, so with some patience i can use
the box, but that also means it's very odd.
Between the tries i allways switch it completly off.
It's a Dell Latitude C810 laptop with a Pentium 3m 1133 Mhz with Intel 82815
chipset that has a ICH2M south-bridge.
Unfortunally it's not a hardware defect, with <= 2.6.17 it allways
works with imo the same config.
for reference i dumped it here:
