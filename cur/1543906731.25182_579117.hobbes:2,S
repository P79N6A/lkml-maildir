I was a bit iffy about including that one, but decided to because
some of the reporters noted that the problem 'went away' after
we pushed out a kernel disabling usb suspend by default.
See comments 16 & 17.
Clearly not the problem everyone was seeing, but it looks like
a few people piled on one bug with the same symptom from multiple
problems.
