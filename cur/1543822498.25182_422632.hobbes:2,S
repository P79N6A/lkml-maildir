There's several that aren't fixing bugs , but I still think they are
useful . 
For instance, I found several drivers that defined tables used when the
driver is defined as a module, but I was compiling the driver built-in
so the table showed as "unused" . 
I added
#ifdef MODULE
...
#endif /* MODULE */
How about those ?
