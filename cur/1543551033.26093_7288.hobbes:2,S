This is becoming an almost weekly asked question, you can find out
more about it by reading..
 
http://lwn.net/2000/0914/kernel.php3
 
http://lwn.net/2000/1005/kernel.php3
It may be an idea that if you intend to follow development kernels
and can't handle the volume of the list, you should at least follow
kernel news sites like the above, or kernel-traffic to at least
find out what you are letting yourself in for.
This will prevent the same questions getting repeatedly asked,
and may save you a lot of headaches.
regards,
Dave.
