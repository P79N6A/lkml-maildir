We're talking about _with_ TCQ, on serial ATA (SATA) where TCQ is common,
and deliberately disabling the write cache so that TCQ completions
indicate when the data is written.
If your measurements indicate that 32 queue slots is adequate with
SCSI drives to eliminate the overhead of disabling write cacheing,
then that's valuable information.  The drives are basically the same
after all.

That's a handy insight too.  Personally I hadn't thought about large
requests reducing the rotation latency with write cache disabled.
