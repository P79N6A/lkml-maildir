Just FYI:
1.) SCSI:
There is a patch circulating at linux-scsi which adds parallelized bus 
scanning to the SCSI subsystem. I believe this cannot be built upon 
parallelization by driver core. But I am not too familiar with the 
subsystem facilities which this patch expands on. The patch is from 
Matthew Wilcox, titled "Asynchronous target discovery".

2.) IEEE 1394:
There was brief preliminary discussion of parallelized probing for the 
ieee1394 subsystem at linux1394-devel. Using driver core's 
parallelization would achieve about 1/3rd of what would be desirable. 
Background: After each bus reset, the 1394 core (nodemgr) has to 
download part or all of the configuration ROM of attached devices to 
determine their identity and capabilities. After that, either a protocol 
driver probe (generic device hook), a protocol driver remove or suspend 
routine (generic device hook), or a protocol driver update routine 
(extra 1394 subsystem hook) is executed; depending on whether nodes were 
added, removed, or in-use nodes were rediscovered. --- I.e. we better 
have these subthreads provided by ieee1394/nodemgr itself.
