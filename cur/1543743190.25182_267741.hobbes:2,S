Hi,
I have applied Alan Cox patch to 2.6.9 and it works with my CompUSA PCI-8212 controller
card. I have a OptoRite DVD-+R/W running w/o any errors. I can burn and read cd's (/dev/hde),
etc..
I noticed that the it8212 patch was not included in the 2.6.9 release. So,,,,
What is the status with having the controller patch included in 2.6.10?
Thanks,
James
