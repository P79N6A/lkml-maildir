Not quite. It needs a reasonable sane userspace sure, but it's not
unreasonable for several cases.

you're very selective in what you read and only think about X.
There's many other reasons to enable/disable devices post boot. 
Having a driver just to call pci_enable_device() is silly; and
there are various scenarios you may want. Userland suspend/resume is
only one of those, posting video cards is one, chip health monitoring is
one, etc etc etc. Don't let your lack of imagination ruin things.
