Yes, I think so.
- They are pretty marginal from a performance POV (iirc)
- They've been a relatively rich source of bugs
- As I said when we merged them (under protest): Private object caches
  like this are just a bad idea - caches should be *shared*, because some
  other code path which wants a zeroed page wants a cache-warm one, not a
  cache-cold one from the allocator (iirc there was doubt over how
  cache-warm these pages are, however).
  Making __GFP_ZERO smarter/more efficient would be a preferable way of
  addressing any performance problems we have in there.
