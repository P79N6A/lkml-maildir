The recent changes to sysfs should be ported to configfs to do this.

No, don't.  Do you think that Joel would not have already worked with
the sysfs people prior to submitting this?  No, he did, and we all
agreed that it should be kept separate.

That's what sysfs calls its files.  They used the same naming scheme
there.  This is nothing that a user ever cares about or sees.

configfs is not going to have that many nodes at all in memory (compared
to sysfs), so I don't think this is a big problem.

So we wait and evolve the interface over time.  Like always...
