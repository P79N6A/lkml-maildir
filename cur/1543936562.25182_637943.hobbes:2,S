I doubt it. I get this nearly _always_ when the system crashes, which
accounts for the vast majority of the times I boot it. (I wish swsusp
didn't suck so much..)

No. That's the number I got last time, but typically I've got 
something in the 3xxxx range.

ntpdate isn't run by any of the init scripts. ntpd is, but like I 
already mentioned, I doubt it would correct vastly incorrect time,
not even being able to track and correct when it advances fast.
