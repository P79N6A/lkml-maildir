s/probably/definitely/
There is a lot of reasons for _not_ putting everything into one binary -
if nothing else, it allows to deal with situations like
	/* do a lot of things that are OK for userland */
	/* do ugly magic */
	/* do a lot of things that are OK for userland */
without exporting ugly crap.
It's much better to have several userland helpers called from init sequence
to do sane stuff in userland and leave remaining crap where it is, than
to add user-visible interfaces that don't make sense.
