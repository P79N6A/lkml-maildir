At the risk of tooting my own horn, you might put there that which I do for my
Qlogic driver- it lists current perio/offset values per target and a list of
currently running commands. It's very easy to support and very very useful.
The old linux aic driver also had a bunch of stats (binned to size)- I believe
I wrote that some years back- but that's not needed if you get Steve Tweedie's
sar package.
