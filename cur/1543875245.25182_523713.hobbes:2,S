2nd race is tricky. We probably need to do this to avoid it:
	task_lock(tsk);
	/* Check if tsk->cpuset is still same. We may have raced with 
	 * cpuset_exit changing tsk->cpuset again under our feet.
	 */
	if (tsk->cpuset == cs && atomic_dec_and_test(&oldcs->count)) {
		task_unlock(tsk);
                check_for_release(oldcs, ppathbuf);
		goto done;
	}
	task_unlock(tsk);
done:
	return 0;
