Hi!
Sorry for interfering but I have the Asus P5RD1-VD with the Realtek
ALC861 (10b9:5461) and with 2.6.13.3 I've got the problem that he
doesn't find /dev/mixer or anything after modprobe snd-hda-intel...
After I attached
http://dlsvr01.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/socket775/P5RD1-V/Audio_Linux.zip
(which doesn't work) to a mail in alsa-devel they told me...
"[...]
It tries to access the ALi controller in the same way as the Intel
controller.
It may be possible that the ALi chip was designed to be compatible
with Intel's, but that they got some detail wrong.  Or that the driver
gets some detail wrong.  There's no way to know without docs[...]"
(not in the archive, yet...)
