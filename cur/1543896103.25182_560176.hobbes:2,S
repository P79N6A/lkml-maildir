Hmm.  So it breaks user space quite a bit.  By break, I mean uses that 
work with more conventional filesystems stop working if you switch to 
NetAp.  Most programs that operate on directory trees willingly cross 
filesystems, right?  Even ones that give you an option, such as GNU cp, 
don't by default.
But if the implementation is, as described, wildly successful, that means 
users are willing to tolerate this level of breakage, so it could be used 
for versioning too.
But I think I'd rather see a truly hidden directory for this (visible only 
when looked up explicitly).
