Are there any OSS drivers for any particular cards for which we don't have
an equivalent ALSA driver ?  If we're ultimately going to be dropping
any of the OSS drivers, I'd rather know about it so I don't waste time
pushing the ~200kb of patches in that area I'm currently carrying
towards Linus.  (Given that most of them don't compile right now due to
the collateral damage from the cli() etc changes , I'd *love* to take
the lazy^Weasy option and just drop them)
