Well considering the other night the power supply went dead, I think that is part of the problem.  It is brand new, and I am being sent another one (free of course).  
I also had my mb loaded at the time (scsi cd-rw, cdrom, internal zip, floppy, 1 hd, Sound card, video, modem, NIC, scsi card) but my last tyan was fine with that load it may be a kt7a thing. 
Several people said that random (keyword here) oopses are more often a hardware thing.  I wonder if the kt7a is going to be able to perform  fully loaded.. 
is anyone running one fully loaded? 4 ide drives, 2 floppy, (5 pci and 1 isa) or 6pci, agp, 512MEG+ RAM?

Interesting, and plausable theory. It would be more interesting to see
register dumps of the memory timing registers on both good and bad
systems, to see if this is the case.
Unfortunatly afair the register level specs of all the affected chipsets
are not available.

Dave.
