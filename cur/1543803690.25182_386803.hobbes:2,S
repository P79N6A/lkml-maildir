Please read what I wrote again.  Station mode power save work involves 
communicating with the ap and managing the hardware.  The first 
interacts with bg scanning.  We haven't even talked about how to handle 
sta mode power save.

Not necessarily in my experience.

If you do not have an association you are not doing bg scanning.

If you wait until the end of the scan to return to the bss channel then 
you potentially miss buffered mcast frames.  You can up the station's 
listen interval but that only gets you so far.  As I said there are 
tradeoffs in doing this.

Sorry I meant this was needed for ap operation.

Ditto.
