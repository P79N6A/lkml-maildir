I agree, that was I explain in a previous post
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109420281830288&w=2)

Not for jostick and midi stuff you have to use pnp bus.
On my computer it works well :
I have removed the support of MIDI and GAMEPORT in alsa driver.
The gameport is handle with ns558
The midi device with a mpu401_pnp I post on the alsa mailling list
(

)
For that it work well you need a pnpbios patch
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109411306024720&w=2) or
even try to use my pnpacpi patch
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109430451522335&w=2)
And the isapnp hotplug script auto load the right module...
