Now that my blood caffeine levels are above the 'sleep' watermark, I should 
probably correct the above in case Ulrich decides to slap us both with a 
slander lawsuit 8-)...
Since (as I said in the original mail) CPU 1 is in a bottom half context, 
both local bh and local interrupts should be disabled on that process!
Basically, the deadlock between the QDIO driver and RPC/fasync can be reduced 
to:
CPU 1                                       CPU 2
(In BH context)                             (In ordinary process context)
spin_lock_irq(&lock1);
                                            spin_lock_bh(&lock2);
dev_kfree_skb_any(skb);
                                            <QDIO Hard interrupt>
                                            (switch to QDIO interrupt context)
    -> sk->write_space();
                                            spin_lock(&lock1);
         -> spin_lock(&lock2);
IOW:
    Either we must demand that CPU 2 uses irq-safe spinlocks in order to 
protect against sk->write_space(), or we must demand that CPU 1 should drop 
'lock1' before being allowed to call dev_kfree_skb_any().
Cheers,
