When you can inject a non canonical RIP into the stack frame you can likely 
also inject other RIPs.  So the whole thing is just a funny way for a program to 
jump in its address space.  0 is as good as any other address for this.
The whole point of the check is just to protect the kernel/CPU against this.
What happens to the user space program itself is no concern because it is the program's
own doing.
