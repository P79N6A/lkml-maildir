The word you look for is not "suspect".
You _cannot_ build a lock using "volatile", unless your CPU is strictly 
in-order and has an in-order memory subsystem too (so, for example, while 
all ia64 implementations today are in-order, they do /not/ have an 
in-order memory subsystem). Only then could you do locking with volatile 
and some crazy Peterson's algorithm.
I don't think any such CPU actually exists.
Anyway, we've had this discussion before on linux-kernel, it really boils 
down to that "volatile" is basically never correct with the exception of 
flags that don't have any meaning and that you don't actually _care_ about 
the exact value (the low word of "jiffies" being the canonical example of 
something where "volatile" is actually fine, and where - as long as you 
can load it atomically - "volatile" really does make sense).
