I'm having endless problem with an eepro100 here. After some trying found out
that doing a soft reset (ctrl+alt+del) fixed the problem, and that a power
cycle made it happen again.
Kernel version is 2.2.17pre20

The error is that it's unable to receive, while the screen (and logs) are
flooded with pairs of messages like:
eth0: card reports no RX buffers.
eth0: card reports no resources.
The driver is compiled in the kernel (not as a module).
