Subject: [PATCH] Make ACPI unselectable in 2.4.20-rc1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Marcelo,
My plan is to start feeding you bits of ACPI changes after 2.4.20 is 
released. However, for 2.4.20, I'd like to make sure the really old code 
in 2.4.20 doesn't bite any casual kernel builders.
Please apply,
Thanks -- Andy
