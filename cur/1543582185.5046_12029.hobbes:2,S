Why would it completely "not work"? 
As long as the host doesn't have something to send while a recieve is
in progress, everything should work. A friend reports that he spent
lots of time trying to debug a network where "too many" collisions
were happening. Turns out one card was in full-duplex, while the other
side wasn't.
I benchmarked my old network at 10-12 seconds for a 100Mb
transfer. That sounds indeed as if there isn't a whole lot of
collisions happening. And I can immagine that the acks run into the
next data-packet all the time, so that performance would indeed be
very bad if the card was misconfigured. On the other hand I had one
machine that was taking 180 seconds for the 100Mb transfer.
Anyway, I remember fiddling with the eexpress 100 driver, and there
the driver was involved in switching the speeds, and doing some
management of the switchover of full-duplex/half-duplex. I'd expect
some message from the driver if it saw such a change. 
But you're saying that the 8139 chip does it internally, and fully  
automatically? Ok. Good.
