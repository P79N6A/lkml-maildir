depmod -ae will list the missing symbols.  Since make modules_install
did not pick up the problem, the symbol is exported but you have a
symbol version mismatch.  The current Makefiles have problems with
versions, to clean up do
  mv .config ..
  make mrproper
  mv ../.config .
  make oldconfig dep clean bzImage modules
  make modules_installs
  Install kernel and reboot
