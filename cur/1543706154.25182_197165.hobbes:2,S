This is unfixable, because someone fucked up and re-used a 
well-established protocol-defined option for another purpose.  E.g. 
"mem=512M" has meant exactly that (and was/is widely used to specify 
that memory should be added up to 512M).
Since the behaviour you describe is kernel-version-dependent, IT CANNOT 
BE FIXED IN THE BOOTLOADER, and whomever thought it was a good idea to 
mess with mem= should be taken out and shot.
