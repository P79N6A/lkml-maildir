Not exactly.
for the native_ functions,  there's room for code sharing.
native_pgd_val, and native_pte_val seem to be the same, for at least
pae and x86_64.
As for the typedefs, the same thing can be done. Much like you did in
paravirt.h, just split out between the < 3 and >= 3 levels.
But if it turns out to be just code movement, and I'm wrong in my
supposition that we can turn three variants of the same code into two,
then I agree
with you, let's keep it this way.
