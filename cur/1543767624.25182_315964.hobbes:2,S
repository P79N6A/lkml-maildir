No I don't think it's valid. esp0 indicates the start of the stack and
right before it you copy the saved registers to a position that does not
correspond to this. And at this point, like you say we know the size of
what will be copied onto the stack so it makes even more sense to make
it correct from the beginning. Having inconsistent states is just asking
for more trouble.

I need to look at the partial stack issue closer, don't think I fully
understand it yet.
