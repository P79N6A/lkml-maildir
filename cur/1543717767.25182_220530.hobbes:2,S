cryptoloop and dm-crypt on-disk formats are FUBAR: precomputable ciphertexts
of known plaintext, and weak IV computation. Anything that claims
"cryptoloop compatible", and only that, is completely FUBAR. dm-crypt is
such. IOW, there are now _two_ backdoored device crypto implementations in
mainline.
Only remaining question is: How long are mainline guys going to continue to
scam people to using backdoored device crypto?
