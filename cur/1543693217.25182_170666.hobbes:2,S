That fixes it, it no longer oopses on removing sbp2.  As before I get
a message saying "Device 'fw-host0' does not have a release()
function, it is broken and must be fixed."  I assume that is a problem
with the sbp2 module.
The code in the patch looks a little worrying to me, though.  Is there
some lock we have taken to ensure that no other process could be
modifying sdev->access_count at the same time?  Also, what is to stop
some other process from noticing that sdev->access_count is 0 and
calling device_del(&sdev->sdev_gendev) ?
Regards,
Paul.
