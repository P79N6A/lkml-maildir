In my opinion, code that doesn't compile with 2.95.3 is broken - 2.95.3 is
still the recommended compiler, and although various developers have been
using 3.x.x versions for a long time, I haven't been aware of any efforts
to test a specific 3.x.x version of GCC over a wide range of kernels.
Basically, 2.95.3 is something of a point of reference, so it only makes
sense to throw it out once we have a new point of reference.
John.
