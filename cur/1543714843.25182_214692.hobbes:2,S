I use the same w83781d and i2c_i801 drivers on my Asus P4PE box, and they
too went belly up with 2.6.5. However, I HAVE tried lm_sensors 2.8.6 and
that made no difference. They're just user-space tools that don't touch the
kernel any more in 2.6.x (right?).
The problem I am seeing now in 2.6.5 is that after loading the w83781d
module, nothing shows up in /sys or /proc, as though the module had not
loaded but lsmod says it is loaded.
In 2.6.4, my sensors showed up hare:
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.3/i2c-0/0-002d/* (w83781d)
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.3/i2c-1/1-0050/* (eeprom)
Now in 2.6.5, with both eeprom and w83781d modules loaded, I only get the
eeprom, and the w83781d is nowhere to be found:
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1f.3/i2c-1/1-0050/* (eeprom)
# find /sys/bus/i2c/drivers/
/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/
/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/w83781d
/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/eeprom
/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/eeprom/1-0050
/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/dev_driver
/sys/bus/i2c/drivers/i2c_adapter
This certainly shows that the driver is loaded, but has not found/registered
any devices?

Ian Morgan
