Heh, require this, and oops, all of the hooks disappear :)
Seriously, no, I don't agree with this.  SELinux is currently being
audited by a number of different companies (include some Linux distros),
and after that happens, and the code is cleaned up, I think they will
probably want their module merged (but I don't speak for them at all.)
As for the other modules, I think the OWL-based one is good enough right
now, and I have a very simple module that is in the November issue of
Linux Journal that is probably clean enough to merge.
thanks,
