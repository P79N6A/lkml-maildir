 So far I've met three users of i82489DX-based systems, two of whom helped
me making them work with 2.4.  So at least at the beginning of 2.4.x they
used to work; hopefully nothing has got broken since then (I try to
monitor changes, but without real hardware to do testing something might
have slipped in unnoticed).  I don't know if these people have kept
upgrading their kernels nor whether they still use the systems.  There
were no bug reports, either, which basically may mean anything. 
 Why do you consider the systems broken?

 Great!
