I've shown a simple way to handle this, so this should not be a problem
anymore.

Since when is /sbin/hotplug "depreciated"?  It still works just fine,
and isn't going anywhere anytime soon.
Turns out that some distros just don't want to use it, and use netlink
instead.  That should not stop you from using it if you wish, as the
kernel sure doesn't care one way or the other.
