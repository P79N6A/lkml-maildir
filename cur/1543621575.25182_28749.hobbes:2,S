Hmm, one of my servers panicked recently with the above message under
heavy SCSI IO load....
The machine is a dual PIII 1GHz with 2GB RAM and 3 18GB disks on an
aic7899 controller.
Kernel is 2.4.17.
The IO load is lots of smallish requests coming from hundreds of network
machines (the machine is a network boot server for about 300 Macs).
Let me know if I can provide any further info....
