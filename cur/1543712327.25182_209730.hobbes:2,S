Hi Vojtech,
Can you tell me what keyboard model uses these codes?
(I have different codes for the scroll wheel on certain MS Office
keyboards. See also somewhere below
http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/kbd/scancodes-5.html#ss5.4
 )
Apart from this concrete question - the number of keyboards and
mice is very large and growing by the day. I think it is hopeless
to try and teach the kernel about all details of each of them.
I think we should try to go for a keyboard/mouse definition file
maintained in user space and fed to the kernel.
