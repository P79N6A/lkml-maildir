This patch looks broken.  I see the lines:
+	.remove = cx_device_remove,
-	cx_driver->driver.remove = cx_driver_remove;
The routine (not in this patch) is still known as "cx_driver_remove"
but now it is linked to from the .remove line as  "cx_device_remove"
A defconfig ia64 build of *-mm3 with this patch fails:
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/tiocx.c:151: error: `cx_device_remove' undeclared here (not in a function)
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/tiocx.c:151: error: initializer element is not constant
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/tiocx.c:151: error: (near initialization for `tiocx_bus_type.remove')
arch/ia64/sn/kernel/tiocx.c:137: warning: `cx_driver_remove' defined but not used         
When I s/cx_device_remove/cx_driver_remove/, then ia64 *-mm3 defconfig builds fine.
