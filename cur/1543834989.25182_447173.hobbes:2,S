I'd be rather surprised to find someone at a Linux conference who hasn't at
least heard of the recurrent flamewars on the topic here...

Not seen any data backing up the "faster", let alone so much faster that
the hassle (and the risk) would make it worth trying... No, Gentoo folks
don't count, around here they are fond of claiming that their self-compiled
systems are at least twice as fast as a binary distribution with the exact
same software.

I'd guess something of the order of 1/100, for testing purposes and idle
curiosity.

LKML (and Linux conferences) are exactly the places where you /only/ find
this kind of people...

At least Fedora is trying hard to just follow upstream packages (in this
case, Linus' kernels) with the absolute minimum of local patches. It makes
good sense, as it reduces the up-front work, and (more important) minimizes
the pain when the later official version is somehow incompatible with the
previews.
If you want ReiserFS 4 to get more exposure, do the legwork to get it into
the official kernel. Distributions should be reluctant to pick it up as
long as its status as an official Linux filesystem is in question.
