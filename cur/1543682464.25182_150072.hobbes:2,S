Subject: [PATCH] Makefile 'rpm' target on Red Hat (8.0/9)

Hi folks!
Since Red Hat moved options like '-ta', '-ba' (all the _build_ targets) away from the command 'rpm' to 'rpmbuild', the 'rpm' target is 'broken' (this is true for - at least - 2.4.19 'til 2.4.21-pre5). This is of course not a really big bug, but it also can be easily solved, by simply changing 'rpm -ta' to 'rpmbuild -ta'.
I'm not sure about other distributions like SuSE, Mandrake...
If 'rpmbuild' doesn't work on other rpm-based distributions (like the two above) I would recommend checking for /etc/redhat-release... Patch for Makefile (from kver 2.4.21-pre5) attached.
Best regards,
 Oliver
