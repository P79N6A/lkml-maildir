I'm not totally convinced that this fixes all problems:
No lockup, and but a slightly increased packet loss: every few minutes a
block of 5-10 packets is lost. Cpu load is low (~30%), I'm running 3
concurrent bw_tcp, the io apic computer is the 'server'.
IIRC my original patch caused a far higher packet loss, perhaps because
it's slower? (you wrote something about 2 r/w accesses).
Are you sure that this really fixed the bug?
Remember that switching the 'trigger mode' bit will revive the io apic.
It's possible that 
* the io apic still locks up.
* but now {en,dis}able_irq() switches the 'trigger mode' bit, and thus
resets the io apic after a few msec --> a few lost packets.
It's far better than before, but I assume the bug is hidden, not fixed.
I'll make additional tests.
Send the patch to Linus - it makes ne2k cards usable with 2.4+io apic.
