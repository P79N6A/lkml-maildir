Unfortunately there is quite a bit of knowledge embedded
in cdrecord. There are _lots_ of weird formats and burners
to take care of. Testing costs real money. Mistakes will
cost real money for many other people.
Sorry. **ahem** This would be an easy project...

True.
Oddly, he did admit that Solaris will support direct usage
of the device names. Here's his list of good systems:
Linux
AIX
BSD-OS (eh, meaning BSDI maybe?)
OpenBSD 
HP-UX   
SGI IRIX
Solaris
Here are the bad systems:
obsolete releases of Linux and Solaris
dead OSes like DOS, DomainOS, AmigaOS, BeOS, NeXT, SunOS 4
nearly dead: VMS, OS/2, Tru64 
SCO crap: OpenServer, UnixWare
Windows
MacOS X
QNX
FreeBSD (Maybe it's dying? It's a BSD.)
If support for the bad systems were discontinued, FreeBSD and
MacOS X would most likely be fixed up soon. Maybe QNX too.
The others can sink. Supporting SCO is just plain wrong.
So you certainly could fork this, drop the silly naming, and
still support the OSes worth caring about.
