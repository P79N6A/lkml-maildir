I see the same thing.  Both of my IDE drives comes up without
the last partition. (Missing ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part3
and ide/host0/bus1/target0/lun0/part7, loosing /usr and /usr/src
in my case.)
There's lots of updates in code that deals with partitions
and devfs, I couldn't find anything obvious wrong though.
