Flood pinging is a policy issue. We don't want just anybody flood ping so
it checks that the ruid is 0. May I ask exactly what went wrong with
"printing"?

Your patch doesn't handle notes of different types if I'm reading it
correctly and it must be first note . I'll look into how the elf stuff
works closer and what kinds of information and sanity checks we can do so
that the kmalloc isn't a DoS problem. I'll relook into both versions of
the elfcap note finder stuff. It's definately 2.3ish though.
