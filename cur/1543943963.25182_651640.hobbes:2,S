If you use a 'struct device' you can use a default attribute group for
that device to be created whenever it is added.
However you are not using the driver core that way, you are just calling
device_create(), which doesn't work that way.
But you can just use an attribute group instead, which still saves you a
lot of code, try using that instead (sysfs_create_group()).
Or go all the way and embed a 'struct device' in your structure, and
create a bus, then you can use the default attribute group, although
that might be a bit more work :)
