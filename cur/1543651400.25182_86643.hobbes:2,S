That's ok, but when function gets large inlining benefits are lost
in the noise.
But one day someone will add another call site. And sometimes people
forget to remove 'inline'. Then we lose big time.

Frankly, I'd say we should not inline anything large
regardless of number of call sites, for reasons outlined above.
The limit is designed exactly for this purpose I think.
