Hello,
I have just modified Andre Hedrick's ide.2.2.19.05042001 patch. You can
find it at "
http://www.ans.pl/ide/ide.2.2.21.05042001-Ole.patch.gz".
 It
should patch 2.2.21pre2 kernel without any warnings/errors. I also
bacported new VIA driver from 2.4.x kernel - this one uses correct IO port
as via_base so values displayed in /proc/ide/via file are now properly
calculated. Check the "BM-DMA base" value :)
Hopefully, devices which work in DMA mode, have DMA/UDMA value instead of
PIO in "Transfer Mode" now. It also should works better with some new
chipsets. If I found time I can also try to backport new Intel, Promise
and HPT drivers if no no one else is working on it. I believe I have
required hardware to test it.
I also have one question about IDE support in 2.4.x kernel. Why, with VIA
MVP3 chipset on my FIC 503+ board, with UDMA33/66/100 HDDs using 2.4.x
kernels I have only 13 MB/sec (tested with hdparm -t). With 2.2.x kernels
hdparm shows 17 MB/sec but with IDE support bacported from 2.4.x kernels
(2.2.19/2.2.20+original Andre Hedrick's patch) it is also 13 MB/sec.
Best regards,
                        Krzysztof Oledzki
