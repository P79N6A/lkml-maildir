Subject: [RFC] EDAC a new sysfs 'subsystem' under /sys/devices
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

EDAC is for detecting and logging memory ECC, PCI
Parity and (future) other hardware errors.
In my process of getting edac ready for kernel
submission:
I have been exploring mechanisms for placing EDAC
controls and attribute files into sysfs for a few days
now.
In the process, I "discovered" how sysfs subystems are
currently used. I have determined that EDAC itself
should be a subsystem, since more than one type of
EDAC device can be created.
I made a copy of drivers/base/sys.c to a new file,
drivers/base/edac.c (and corresponding .h file) and
refactored it to become a 'edacdev' subsystem.
I have mounted edac to: /sys/devices/edac because the
/sys/device/system subsystem is not exported (at the
moment. I suppose that could be changed). 
I now have:
/sys/devices/edac/mc/mc0/csrow0 kobjects working and
am adding attribute files to their respective
kobjects.
My RFC is:
Should I leave edac under /sys/devices OR refactor
drivers/base/sys.c and export the "system" subsystem
and mount edac under /sys/devices/system? 
Another RFC is:
Should EDAC really have a "new" subsystem in the
kernel?  (I believe it fits bets, but am looking for
alternatives)
It requires a new drivers/base/edac.c (and .h file +
plumbing).  I would like to see that, as it really
works nicely. The EDAC module currently in the -mm
tree will depend  on it, in order to implement the
requested sysfs features. (Other options are possible
I suppose)
The only problem I ran into was that I needed further
subdirectories under 'mc/mc0', and I had to resort to
using kobject_register() since the subsystem didn't
have methods for such creation. Yet that code now
works nicely.
I suppose I am looking for verification of the
direction I am progressing in.
Thanks for any input
