Subject: [PATCH] fix sun partition overflow over 1T
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Although sun partition labels aren't supposed to support > 1T, apparently
linux partition editors will allow up to 2T.  This can cause problems
in the kernel when these larger partitions are read, due to a signed
int container.
num_sectors in the sun_disklabel struct is marked as __u32 in 2.4, and 
as __be32 in 2.6.  However, this is assigned to a signed int in
sun_partition():
                int num_sectors;
                st_sector = be32_to_cpu(p->start_cylinder) * spc;
                num_sectors = be32_to_cpu(p->num_sectors);
Changing num_sectors to an unsigned int avoids this problem.
Thanks,
-Eric
