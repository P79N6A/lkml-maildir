Subject: [patch] fix the irq migration

While debugging some other irq migration issue, observed this issue with
-git kernels. Ingo, please ACK it.

With the commit 76d2160147f43f982dfe881404cfde9fd0a9da21, irq_chip
default_disable() became an empty function. And with this change, irq
migration in the case of Edge triggered IO-APIC and MSI interrupts happens
with out masking the irq.
Appended patch fixes by using the mask/unmask handlers of irq_chip directly
while doing the irq migration.
