let me amend this slightly:  works fine when not using xfree86 with pci
s3virge.  guess it wasnt the kernel at fault after all.  :-)  2.4.2-pre3
behaves also, haven't bothered trying anything else yet.  note that
commenting out the bits of XF86Config relevant to the s3 was sufficient,
didn't need to physically remove the card.
it is still odd, since there aren't any resource conflicts (that i am
aware of)
thanks,
j.
