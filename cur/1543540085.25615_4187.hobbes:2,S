There's a 2.4.0-test5 kernel out there. The diff is pretty huge, to a
large degree due to a bttv driver syntactic split-up and due to the NLS
forward-port from 2.2.x. 
Other notable bugfixes:
 - the buggy Toshiba (and possibly others) BIOS memory reporting thing
   is fixed. Just ignore RAM that the BIOS reports in the 640k-1M range.
   The BIOS is confused.
 - Manfred Spraul found and fixed a SMP TLB invalidation problem with threads.
 - various architecture updates (arm, ia64, sparc, sh..)
 - MD driver cleanups
 - Toshiba floppy controller problem workaround
 - updated DRI code (works with XF86-4.0.1)
 - various driver updates (ToPIC CardBus should work, ide updates, etc)
 - "kfree_s()" is gone. It hasn't existed for several years, but people
   still used it. No more.
 - USB driver updates and fbcon cleanups
 - various othe rupdates I've repressed.
Be happy.
		Linus
