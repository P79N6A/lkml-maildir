Tese used to be plain-old global variables, but someone submitted 
a patch that to turn them into the __get_cpu_var() form. I don't 
know why; there's no real performance reason, since these are almost 
never incremented, except a bit during boot.  What if we just change 
them back to global vars?
I've also day-dreamed about moving these stats to somewhere in
in the /sys directory. Any suggestions there?
