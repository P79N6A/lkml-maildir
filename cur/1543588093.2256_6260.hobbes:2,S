Agreed.

I don't think that it's needed - old kernels (up to -CURRENT ;-) will
simply refuse to mount if ->s_inode_size != 128. Old utilites may be
trickier, though...
I'm somewhat concerned about the following: last block of inode table
fragment may have less inodes than the rest. Reason: number of inodes
per group should be a multiple of 8 and with inodes bigger than 128
bytes it may give such effect. Comments?
I would really, really like to end up with accurate description of
inode table layout somewhere in Documentation/filesystems. Heck, I
volunteer to write it down and submit into the tree ;-)
