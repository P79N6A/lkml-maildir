Try 
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops/ksymoops-0.7b.tar.gz.
  It handles
SMP correctly and has better module handling, especially if you install
the syslog and modutils patches from the same directory.
I have given up trying to get the kernel version updated, other people
have patched it and introduced bugs but my fixes are ignored - and I
wrote it!  As far as I am concerned the kernel version is buggy and not
supported.
