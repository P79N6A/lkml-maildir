No I do not.  Read the post.  I suggested placing the documentation on
kernel.org, on your site, or on bitmover.com where it belongs.  This
documentation for a proprietary software product does not belong in the
Linux kernel tree itself.  It is nothing less than an advertisement.
Was it paid for?
(And there you may have an argument that would satisfy me.  However, it
is not me I'm worried about.  It is the other kernel developers who are
silently seething at this situation.  Yes they are, use your ears.)
