Does this filesystem stack work with multiple mount points?
My guess is that the filesystem change notification would be a better
solution, either in userspace or in kernelspace, doesn't matter.  But
that is far from finished or even generally accepted.
For the diploma thesis, feel free to use any hack you like, including
hijacking syscalls.  But remember that it is a hack and nothing else,
only helping you to remain on schedule and focus more on the real
subject.  And don't plan on kernel acceptance either, as you will fail
either that or the thesis and I'd choose the thesis.
