Begin by finding out where the EIP is.  It should be a spin_lock().  The
oops says it is kernel/timer.c:258.
This line is a double locking of an already-locked lock.  So find where
the initial lock was.  The oops said that is kernel/timer.c:398.
Look at the call chain (from the oops) from the first to the second
lock.  Someone assumed it could not happen.  Obviously they were wrong.
