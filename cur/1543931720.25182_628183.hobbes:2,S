No.
Are you doubting that the current ub code has the problem, aren't you?
My patch shouldn't introduce a NEW problem to ub.
I have investigated all code paths which call ub_end_rq() in ub.c,
and confirmed that ub_end_rq() is always called with the queue lock
held.  (sc->lock is registered as a queue lock.)
So there is no such race in the current ub code.
You don't need to rewrite ub.
