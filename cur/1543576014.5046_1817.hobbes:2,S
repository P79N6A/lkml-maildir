I don't think so.  There are two places reiserfs calls down/up.  In our
file->release() callback, and in the ioctl we added for lilo so it can
upack files with tails.
Neither calls copy_from/to_user or does an allocation other than
GFP_BUFFER.  As far as I know that should be safe, but the change is
trivial if we need to make it.
