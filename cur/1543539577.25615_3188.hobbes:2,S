Are you THAT stupid ? Script kiddies can be VERY stupid but since week after
patch will go in kernel and scripts on all sites will be updates to workaround
that patch (it's not hard, really) we'll get NOTHING after that week. Except
kernel bloat, that is.

Unfortuntally this fix is 75% fix for accidental destroying and less then 1%
fix agains malicious script kiddie.
