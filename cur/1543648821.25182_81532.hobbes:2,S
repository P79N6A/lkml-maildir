There is nothing concrete at all about said "exploit".
It looks like just a clever way to divert the victim's
attention from the real mechanism these guys are using
to root peoples boxes.
It is nearly impossible for a TCP frag handling exploit
to allow a root shell and socket to that shell to be
created.  So I think the claims are total nonsense.
