Consider small rant about literal IO references to magic locations 
hereby ranted. Especially in header files completely unrelated to the 
IO function in question.
-#define __beep() asm("movb $0x3,%al; outb %al,$0x61")
Let's please not assume that every i386 implementation has a full set 
of legacy PC IO hardware.
