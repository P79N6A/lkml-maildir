I don't know that this is so.  I can ask them, but I don't know if they'll
tell me that.
Furthermore, it's better to have the code upstream[*].  That way the person
wanting to make a sweeping change across all arches who knows how the change
should be made can have a go at making the change, rather than someone who's
constantly playing catchup and may not understand fully.
 [*] As people keep saying.
Constantly playing catchup really isn't fun, as I'm sure you appreciate with
maintaining the -mm tree.  You, after all, do it on a much larger scale than
everyone else.

I don't, no.  Besides, I *do* have Panasonic devices I can install random
software and hardware on to:-)  But it's not COTS stuff.
