I'm getting some strange reports with vmstat on a dual iPPro running 2.2.18,
it doesnt happen very frequently, but i see it a lot when compiling something 
(kernel and mysql specially, not when compiling small stuff), though it doesnt 
look like a high-load issue. When the machine is idle (ie. most of the time at 
the moment) it doesnt show up.
The report is like this:
#vmstat 1 60 | awk '{ print $16 }'
id
0

20452224

I wasnt able to trigger it in a predictable way, it just pops up...
BUT if i open two vmstats in different consoles.. the number doesnt show up in 
both, just in one of them... so i'm not sure at all if this is a kernel bug, or 
just another (vmstat?) feature =)
I also found a reference to something similar in
