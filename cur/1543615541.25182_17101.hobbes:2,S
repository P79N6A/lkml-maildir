AFAICS it does:
include/linux/reiserfs.h:
#define sd_v1_rdev(sdp)         (le32_to_cpu((sdp)->u.sd_rdev))
#define set_sd_v1_rdev(sdp,v)   ((sdp)->u.sd_rdev = cpu_to_le32(v))
[jgarzik@rum reiserfs]$ grep v1_rdev *.c
inode.c:        rdev = sd_v1_rdev(sd);
inode.c:        set_sd_v1_rdev(sd_v1, inode->i_rdev );
In the first inode.c line shown here, it passes the value received
directly to init_special_inode.
