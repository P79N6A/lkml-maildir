I seem to recall that Creative have said from the start that it was their 
intention to release a binary driver 'to at least get people up and running', 
and to follow it up with proper documentation and sample source code as soon 
as possible.
Be fair - they may have restrictions on the code they're already using, so
they're not allowed to release it. 
They're working on the documentation, and a driver that they can release in
source form - but as a stopgap, they're releasing a binary. That's reasonable 
enough, isn't it?
