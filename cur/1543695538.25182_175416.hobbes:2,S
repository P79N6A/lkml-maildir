According to Rik van Riel and HPA, fsync() does not check page tables 
for dirty bits.  This is confirmed by my testing, in which msync() takes 
significantly longer than fsync() for the same file (in a ramdisk). 
msync() on the 3 pages dirtied took 39 usec, while fsync() on the whole 
200KB file took 12 usec.
Also, some googling leads to to believe that if the file is mmapped and 
you close() it, it won't get synced.
