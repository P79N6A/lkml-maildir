I don't believe a non-compete clause accomplishes your goal, as I've
recently written.  On the other hand, a "don't reverse engineer and
don't allow your copy to be used to reverse engineer" clause does.
The "no reverse" clause is pretty common and difficult to argue against.
The non-compete clause is probably not enforcable and looks like
restraint of trade.

If anyone can think of a better way for us to both let you use the tool
and protect our hard work, I'm listening.  The repeated outrage over the
restrictions isn't any more fun for me than it is for you.  Any answer,
however, has to take our issues into consideration as well as yours.
