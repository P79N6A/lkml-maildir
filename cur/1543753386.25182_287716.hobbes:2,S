To give some background info about why kbuild does what it does.
A kernel being compiled partly with and partly without say -regparm=3
will result in a non-workable kernel.
The same goes for a kernel that is partly built using gcc 2.96, partly
using 3.3.4 for example.
So kbuild pr. default will force a recompile for any .o file where
opions to gcc differ, or name of gcc has changed. Today no check has
been implemented to check the actual gcc executable timestamp - and
neither is this planned.
Default behaviour today is to recompile if anything change.
But as hpa points outs this hits us with nfs mounted kernel tree when
performing a make install - because install has vmlinux as prerequsite.
So this leaves us with at least two possibilitites:
1) Unconditionally execute make install assuming vmlinux is up-to-date.
   make modules_install run unconditionally, so this is already know
   practice
2) Detect that aother user is running the build - and therefore skip
   the kernel and the module build.
   This is a rather intrusive change since with current kbuild structure
   it is rather difficult to stop this in all relevant cases.
