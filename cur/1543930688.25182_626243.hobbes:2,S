Big thanks,
Still NFS server just don't want to accept the connection
I noticed that if I first mount with
-tnfs, unmount,  and then mount with -tnfs4, it works
Assuming that 
[PATCH 2.6.24-rc4] proc: Remove/Fix proc generic d_revalidate 
is the fix for crossmnt bug, I applied it to both client and server,
but no luck.
Still see empty folders.
my /etc/exports file (on old box):
/ *(insecure,rw,fsid=0,crossmnt,async,anonuid=1000,anongid=100)
/dev *(insecure,rw,fsid=1,async,anonuid=1000,anongid=100)
/mnt/disk2 *(insecure,rw,async,anonuid=1000,anongid=100)
It is totally insecure, but I have just home network,
and it is behind firewall, and besides I am testing this now.
I am afraid that I am doing something wrong since
I don't know nfs well yet, and especially nfs4
(But I want to make nfs4 work too)
