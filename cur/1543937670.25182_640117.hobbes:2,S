Maybe you are right.

I don't think so, usb doesn't be affected by struct class mutex, they
only use the lock of struct device. As I replied before, the lockdep
issue exist only between class_interface and class_device.

I may file the updated patch with more nesting changes and test it of
course. Actually I should have done it, thanks.

1) Using CLASS_NORMAL/CLASS_PARENT/CLASS_CHILD will be enough.
or
2) Simply add SINGLE_LEVEL_NESTING in class_device_add and other
class_device functions because it is the only possible nest-lock place
as I know.
Do you agree?
