D you just skip comments of people on the mmu_notifier? It took me to 
remind you about Andrew's comments to note those. And I just responded on 
the XPmem issue in the morning.
Again for the gazillionth time: There will be no CONFIG_XPMEM because the 
functionality needs to be generic and not XPMEM specific.
