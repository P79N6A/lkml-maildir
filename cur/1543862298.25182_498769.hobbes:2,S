Darrick,
I tried 2.6.20-rc4 on a Dempsey system here in my lab and it worked
fine. No watchdog lockups.
Can you try idle routine with hlt instead of mwait. There is no boot
option for this in x86_64, but you can change
arch/x86_64/kernel/process.c:select_idle_routine() not to enable mwait.
With that default kernel should use hlt based idle.
Also, worth seeing will be, what happens when nmi_watchdog=0,
nmi_watchdog=1, and nmi_watchdog=2 boot options. That should tell us
whether nmi_watchdog is raising some false alarm or the CPUs are indeed
getting locked up here..
Thanks,
Venki
