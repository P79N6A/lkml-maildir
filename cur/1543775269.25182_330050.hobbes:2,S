Subject: [patch 2.6.12] Improper initrd failure message at boot time
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/29/302

On system boot up, there was an failure reported to boot.msg:
     <5>Trying to move old root to /initrd ... failed
According to initrd(4) man page, step #7 of BOOT-UP OPERATION
is described as below:
          7. If the normal root file has directory /initrd, device
          /dev/ram0 is moved from  /  to  /initrd.   Otherwise  if
          directory  /initrd  does  not  exist device /dev/ram0 is
          unmounted.
We got service calls from customers concerning about this failure
message at boot time. Many systems do not have /initrd and thus
the message can be changed in the case of non-existing /initrd
so that it does not sound like a failure of the system.
