Unless you like tyrany choice is a good thing(TM).  Trust

On Solaris and some other platforms you can, with lots of
money, buy a license to run the Veritas journaling
filesystem.  It comes with a license manager and you have to
get license keys to mount the filesystems.  Ever had a
filesystem not come up after a reboot because the license
expired, i have (ouch, i told management to renew the
license).  Is veritas fast? I don't know.  They hype the
journaling, not speed.  And what are you going to benchmark
against?.
Recently Veritas announced they were going to support Linux.
I'm curious to see how they fare in a shootout with the
other journaling filesystems.  Of course i wouldn't taint MY
kernel to run it when i have four others to choose from.

Fantastic.  And that is largly without competition.  Just
wait and watch what the JFS and XFS developers do to improve
their products to keep up.
As for UFS, the only thing they can do to it is to adjust
the block allocation heuristics.  Something i'm sure they
have done to death for the TPC benchmarks they live and die
by.
