Alright, still looks good:
<snip>
ACPI: Subsystem revision 20040615
ACPI: Interpreter enabled
ACPI: Using IOAPIC for interrupt routing
<snip>
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: EHCI Host Controller
PCI: Setting latency timer of device 0000:00:1d.7 to 64
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: irq 23, pci mem f881dc00
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: new USB bus registered, assigned bus number 1
PCI: cache line size of 128 is not supported by device 0000:00:1d.7
ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: USB 2.0 enabled, EHCI 1.00, driver 2004-May-10
hub 1-0:1.0: USB hub found
hub 1-0:1.0: 8 ports detected
USB Universal Host Controller Interface driver v2.2
<snip>
So it doesn't look like a ACPI problem.
