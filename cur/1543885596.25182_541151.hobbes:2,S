Obviously I was not proposing a nice theoretical model, my work is more similar
to a quick and dirty hack that could resolve some problems (at least in my case)
like the crash of critical services due to OOM-killing (or due to the failure of
a malloc() when OOM-killer is disabled).
When $VERY_CRITICAL_DAEMON dies *all* the users blame the sysadmin [me]. If a
user application dies because a malloc() returns NULL, the sysadmin [I] can
blame the user saying: "hey! _you_ tried to hog the machine and _your_
application is not able to handle the NULL result of the malloc()s!"... :-)
A solution could be to define the critical processes unkillable via
/proc/<pid>/oom_adj, but the per-process approach doesn't resolve all the
possible cases and it's quite difficult to manage in big environments, like HPC
clusters.
Anyway, it seems that I need to deepen my knowledge about the recent development
of process containers and openvz...
Thanks,
