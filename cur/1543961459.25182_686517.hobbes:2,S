the first thing to check, does latest x86.git work fine:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/x86.git/README
? We've got fixes queued up - in particular one could result in 'slow' 
systems by virtue of denying an ioremap():
  Subject: revert: "x86: ioremap(), extend check to all RAM pages"
maybe the bisection went haywire.
Or the secondary core booted up in such a sucky way that it causes such 
massive slowdowns? Perhaps we are flooding the system with local APIC 
timer interrupts or other interrupts?
