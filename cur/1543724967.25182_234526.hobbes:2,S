Yes, it could be that the default value of zero for lower_zone_protection
is not appropriate.

If the kernel has no swap there is nothing it can do with an anonymous page
(ie: the thing whcih malloc() gives you).  It is effectively pinned memory,
because there's nowhere we can write it to get rid of it.
If you end up pinning all of your ZONE_NORMAL pages with anonymous memory,
further GFP_KERNEL allocation attempts will go oom.
