Heh, ok. I'm personally not able to really judge any wireless-extensions 
stuff, so I have to go by how noisy the discussion becomes ;)
I'll leave this to you guys to sort out, I just did want to pipe up (since 
I was asked to) that as far as _I_ am concerned, user-space interfaces 
really are very important. Whether this is one of the really important 
ones or not, I leave to the people involved to figure out, but I really 
don't want to have developers dismissing the issue.
(I think some people used to, and I think we've gotten better at it. But 
maybe I'm just being overly optimistic again ;)
