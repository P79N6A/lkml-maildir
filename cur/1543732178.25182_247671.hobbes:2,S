You can't have a file and a directory with the same name in W*.
Alternative data streams don't appear in a normal directory. You
need special API:s and tools to see them. If you know the name of and ADS
you can however access them with standard tools, including cygwin.
echo foo >a.txt
echo bar >a.txt:b.txt
You can also have ADS's on directories. Not sure how Reiserfs4 does that.
mkdir foo
echo bar >foo:a.txt
