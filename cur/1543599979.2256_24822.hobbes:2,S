I tried 2.4.8, which didn't work.  I did compile the airport module, but it had
unresolved symbols...  I ended up trying 2.4.9-ac1, which was the first kernel
to actually compile.  I then compiled -ac2, which did let the airport work :o)
Finally, I got a benh kernel off someone on #debianppc (openprojects), which
compiled, but which I haven't tried yet.
