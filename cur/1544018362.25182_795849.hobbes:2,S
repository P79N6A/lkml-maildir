Sorry, I was out of town, I'll build a kernel asap.
Stefan confirmed the bug (on i386 platform, apparently x86_64 did not 
expose the broken behaviour) and the bug fixed at Ubuntu with your 
patch. See 
https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/318565
 . So I assume he 
tested it and it fixed the problem, but I'll test as well myself.
Thanks!
Bernhard
