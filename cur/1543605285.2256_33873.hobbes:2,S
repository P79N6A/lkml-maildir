As I understand it, there's two problems with your suggestion:
 1. The fact that it's x86-specific would rule it out as part of
    the actual code of most functions, as they are designed to
    work on any of the supported processors without change.
    However, this can be dealt with by using a macro function and
    dropping the macro definition in an arch-specific header file.
 2. The code isn't normally designed for what gdb does with it,
    but for what it does when run on its own. I believe that the
    original results in an error message being thrown up on the
    screen, but I suspect your replacement would just halt the
    processor and make the user think Linux had crashed.
Comments, anybody?
Best wishes from Riley.
