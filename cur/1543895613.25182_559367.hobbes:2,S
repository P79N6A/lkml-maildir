Ok. I'll bounce a note to Junio just due to curiosity in case he goes 
"ahh, yeah, it was that known bug", but I'll otherwise ignore this.
Git-1.5.x is such a radically better version (not because it fixes this 
bug, but because we fixed a number of other issues, notably some very 
basic usability things), that I think any git users should really upgrade 
to a newer version.
IOW, there's simply no reason to stay on anything older (git has always 
been backwards compatible since very early on, so upgrading to a newer 
version of git won't break anything, although some of the new UI's might 
obviously cause you to do things differently).
