Why a "BSD-style" rather than a straight BSD license?  The question of
BSD and GPL compatability is already a done deal.  If you say "BSD-style",
we then need to go through clause-by-clause and figure out how it's different
from the BSD license and what implications it has.

There's enough of the damned things already.  Please don't invent another one.
