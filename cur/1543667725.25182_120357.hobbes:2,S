It just exits immediately with exit code 1. (*shrug*)

When I run this code it begins to put out Prev N New M lines.

E.g. which type of hardware problem?
Thanks a million for your help so far, it is great to experience how
fast people are respoding!
I'll evaluate that other suggestion about TSC_DISABLE now and will get
back to you as soon as I can tell you more.
