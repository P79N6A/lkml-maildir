 From memory :
go to 
http://www.kernel.org/
1/ get linux-2.4.18.tar.gz as you probably did for 2.5.15.
2/ before configuring the kernel sources:
- get patch-2.4.19-pre8.gz,
- apply the patch by:
    . going into the 2.4.18 source directory,
    . running zcat <path_to_download_dir>/patch-2.4.19-pre8.gz | patch -p1
3/ configure, compile, install.

Strange.
I've a similar problem here with an ECS K7S5AL where one of the 4 IDE 
devices seems to transmit bad data on a "cold" boot, this drive's id is 
usually "Maxtor 4G120J6" but on a cold boot the BIOS see everytime a L 
instead of a M in "Maxtor" and other characters are shifted 
(--ascii_value or maybe low bit of ascii_value zeroed, didn't check) at 
regular intervals. The whole data on the disk seems to be affected as 
Linux can't mount the only fs on the drive. I moved the disk from hdc to 
hdd and then to hdb and each time it behaves like described above.
Updating the BIOS doesn't solve the problem. The only workaround is to 
wait several minutes for the system to warm up.
After warm up I *never* encoutered a crash with 2.4.19-pre7-ac2 which 
holds the very same SiS IDE driver than 2.4.19-pre8 (at least 14 days 
uptime doing regular video grabbing on another disk and occasionnal huge 
file transfers between the Maxtor and other disks).
In my case the problem must be the drive firmware or the hardware 
itself. This may be the same problem for you. Do you have another drive 
to make tests with ? When your BIOS doesn't recognise your drive, what's 
the error ? When the BIOS recognise it and Windows bluescreens, what's 
the drive ID reported by the BIOS ?
You didn't tell us what your mainboard model is, could you please do so 
and tell us the harddrive model (hdparm -i) ?
