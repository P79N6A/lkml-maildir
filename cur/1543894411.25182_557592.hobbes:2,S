Well, sorta.  Things tend to die early heat deaths if you repeatedly  
spike the temperature (different rates of thermal expansion and all  
that jazz).  If you alternated repeatedly between max-CPU/no-fan and  
no-CPU/max-fan, staying just within the thermal kill limits and  
spending 3/4 of the time at near max temp, you'd probably have a 30%  
chance to kill an average CPU within a couple weeks.
I know when designing the G5 CPU, IBM had to be _really_ careful  
about the variably high operating temperature.  Their first few  
designs ended up having BGA breakdown well before the desired  
lifetime due to thermal creep (long-duration at high temp) and  
fatigue shear failure (alternation between high and low temp).   
There's a paper somewhere on the web about the whole deal.
