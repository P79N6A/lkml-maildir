So the hypervisor indeed tracks each individual page state? Note that I do 
not propose to change the page state but a counter for page states. I am 
bit confused about how not touching a page can cause page state 
transitions. But then I do not know much about hypervisors. What magic is 
going on in the background that could enable the hypervisor to track 
counter increments?
