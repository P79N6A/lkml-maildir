As client: Changes made in the server side aren't in the client side.
I have several NFS servers that are mounted in an only NFS client. When I
have 2 NFS servers there's no problem at all, but when I have 3 or more NFS
servers the NFS client don't see changes in NFS servers properly.
Thanks for your help,
