OnStream Di30 (using ide-scsi and osst drivers), when reading
or writing I regularly get these kernel messages:
<3>ide-scsi: CoD != 0 in idescsi_pc_intr
Let's assume flaky hardware; nothing we can hold the kernel to
blame for (which is 2.6.19.1) -- it's a good thing it's calling
our attention.  There's no data corruption, btw.
However, said message is quite useless because undescriptive
and too terse.
