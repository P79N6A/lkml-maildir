Hello!
Just wanted to report of the following problems:
Compile Problems when selecting the following:
- Selected PCMCIA-SCSI
- Selected Framebuffer -> Aty128fb
- Sound / trident.c
Other bugs:
- devfs init is still missing -> /dev/vc/0 is the only console.
- floppy driver still broken
- ntfs sometimes crashes the system: working on a loopback file caused
  ntfs to report corruptions in the file system and this hangs system
  completly.
If you need more informations, just tell me. Currently I've some time
to debug parts of the kernel.
Nico
