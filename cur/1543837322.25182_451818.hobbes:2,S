I don't quite understand.  What am I looking for in top?
Here's the before and after:
before:
$ grep C /proc/acpi/processor/*/*
/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power:active state:            C1
/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power:max_cstate:              C8
/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power:   *C1:                  type[C1]
promotion[--] demotion[--] latency[000] usage[00000000] duration[00000000000000000000]
