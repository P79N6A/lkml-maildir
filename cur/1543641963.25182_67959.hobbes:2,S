Somewhat related to this - is there currently, or would it be possible to include in what you're working on now, a sane way for two or more machines to access a SCSI drive on a shared SCSI bus - in other words, several host adaptors in different machines are all connected to one SCSI bus, and can all access a single hard disk.  At the moment, you can only do this if all machines mount the disk read-only.
