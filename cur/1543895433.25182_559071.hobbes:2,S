You can do that, but you typically don't need to -- the
whole idea of "compatible" is to avoid this, and not need
to have huge "pci id" style tables in the device drivers
that need constant updating.  But you _can_ do it, sure.

I would just put 8540 in the table and in all device trees
in this case.

Nope.

I don't like making up names just for this, I don't see what good
this would do.  Using a pre-existing code name is fine of course,
as long as it is a unique identifier, since that's all that matters.
