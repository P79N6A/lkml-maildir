I agree TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT is not worth it at the current time, if you take into 
account the bad guys, or very slow networks.
1) Setting a timeout in a millisecond range (< 1000) is not very good because 
some clients may need much more time to send your server the data (very long 
distance). So a second granularity is OK.
2) After timeout is elapsed, the server tcp stack has no socket associated to 
your client attempt. So closing the server listening socket wont be able to 
send RST. I agree a RST *should* be sent by the server once the timeout is 
triggered.
A typical tcpdump of what is happening for a tcp_defer_accept timeout of 20 
seconds is :

win 0
So TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT might send way more packets than needed. Packets 4,6,8,10 
(and their corresponding acks 5,7,9,11) seem un-necessary, since (1,2,3) has 
engaged a normal TCP session (three way handshake).
We only should wait for the data coming from the client to be able to pass the 
new socket to the listening application.
