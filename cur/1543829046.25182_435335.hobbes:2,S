OK for this one, but what I mean is that vfs_unlink() will kill dentry
(its second argument, which your fix protects), while the down()/up()
we initially suspected, and tried to protect, play with nd.dentry->d_inode,
which is the directory in which we are removing dentry. And I can't see how
nd.dentry->d_inode can be killed during vfs_unlink(), reason why I thought
the fix above did not provide any benefit.

I'm using it at home right now, doing lots of git-checkout -f and make -j
dep ; make -j 4 bzImage modules on SMP without a glitch. Right now I'm
running rc2 without trouble and I noticed you did not merge the fix for
sys_unlink() that we discussed above. May be you simply have forgotten it
or may be we are in sync but were talking about different things.
