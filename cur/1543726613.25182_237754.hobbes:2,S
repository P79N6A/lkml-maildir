Lets get this bit of the discussion over with :-), the kernel has uint*_t
in it in a few places, this is now a standard type so we will use it, if
someone is going to work on the DRM they'll see the surrounding uint32_t
so they'll know what it looks like and I'll make sure none of the others
sneak in....
