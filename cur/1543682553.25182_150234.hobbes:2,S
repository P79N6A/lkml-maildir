Subject: 2.6.0-test1 - device_suspend KERN_EMERG message?

Is there any special reason to scream that we're suspending devices in
device_suspend?
int device_suspend(u32 state, u32 level)
{
        struct device * dev;
        int error = 0;
        printk(KERN_EMERG "Suspending devices\n");
...
And likewise further below during resume.
On my box, syslog shouts to all xterms and KDE throws up a kwrite message
too.  Why is this an emergency?  If there are no objections, I'll send
a patch to move these messages to KERN_NOTICE.
