We've only _just_ started paying attention to what we export. I tried to
keep the initial cut of headers_install very simple and uncontentious --
sticking to implementation, and not policy. So I didn't do a
particularly thorough cull of stuff that we shouldn't be exposing --
it's expected that we may lose _some_ more stuff.
But breaking userspace like _this_ isn't acceptable, and we're not doing
it.
