Thanks.  I had missed it in the 2.5.65 change log since it didn't
mention initramfs, but now see the "Early page_writeback initialization"
entry.  The patch does fix the divide by zero error.

I'm working on a custom system that can only send a single file to
the nodes (over a custom interconnect) when they boot, so neither
tftping a ramdisk or a PXE boot loader would work for me.  Having
the initramfs image be bundled into the kernel is a real life saver.
