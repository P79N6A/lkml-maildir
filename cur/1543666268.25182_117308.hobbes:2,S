Since I have nothing to do with Redhat I'm not sure what their lawyers
might say, but what about Microsoft lawyers?  Microsoft has already
shown their willingness to pursue such cases (can anyone say Lindows?)
but I haven't seen their lawyers attack WINE, even though their stated
goal is "Wine is an implementation of the Windows Win32 and Win16 APIs
on top of X and Unix. Think of Wine as a Windows compatibility layer." 
They sure are using the Windows name in claiming compatibility.
So are you exhibiting worse corporate behavior than Microsoft?  It would
seem so.  Do you think Redhat or SuSE would be worse?  Maybe, but that
doesn't make it right.
Later,
Tom
