Not true. I for one want to do a 'cvs update' to get current and be able
to look at revision logs and keep my own branches and merge them onto the
tip.  Sure, I can do this manually, but an SCM makes this quite a bit
easier.
Other useful tools are things like CVS blame:

(not sure how this would be done with single user check-in, but there's
probably a way to hack it in)
