Hi,
I've got an HP 2510p with a 965 mobile chipset and ICH8, lspci is at
http://people.freedesktop.org/~airlied/hp2510p/hp-lspci-vv.txt
Resume is failing on the hard disk resume by the looks of it (no video
to prove it..) but I've rmmod nearly everything and my network
interface comes back and I can ping it but anything that tries to
access the disk looks stuck...
I also know someone running the same laptop using drivers/ide drivers
whose suspend/resume works properly....
I'm running the latest Fedora rawhide kernel based on -rc3-git7

Dave.
