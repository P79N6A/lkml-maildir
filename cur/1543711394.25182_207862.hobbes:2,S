Looks good :)

Do you mind adding the session-id (sid) as well?
There is still a lot of information left in the kernel that we are not
including in the log. I'm not proposing adding all that other stuff
(except the sid, already mentioned), but maybe we can make it even
easier to add them in the future:
One idea is to add the size of the structure to log. The start of the
struct could be something like:
struct acct_base {
	char flags;
	char ac_version;
	__u16 ac_size;
}
This makes future extentions easier in two seperate ways:
Userspace acct can recognize futuristic data structures. It will, of
course, not be able to process them, but it can warn the user and then
continue on to the next struct.
Also, it would make it possible to add new fields at the end of the
structure _without_ bumping the version-number. (Like an extention to
the same format). When userspace find a v2 struct bigger that it's
"struct acct_v2" it can parse the first part of the data with struct
acct_v2 and just ignore the rest. This makes it trivial to add new
fields without breaking userspace.
