No. You did broke the subsystem in several occasions, you do this
at the bad moment, and now you introduced a change in behaviour
in a stable kernel release, between -rc1 and -rc2, without any
warning. I think I have enough reasons to be angry.

The FAQ on linux1394 site was indeed updated 2 days ago. I'm sorry
I didn't think to look there.
Before posting, I did try to check the linux1394 mailing lists for 
information. linux1394-announce has no new mails since march, 
linux1394-devel didn't seem to contain anything obvious about this
(besides a thread "Re: Problem with Kernel 2.4.21-rc1 - latest svn"
which I couldn't read due to sourceforge problems - it kept saying
"no such forum"...)
I did look at the subversion checkin' log. I did look at the bitkeeper
checkin' log. Nothing there.

Strange, usb-storage seems to work quite fine with respect to the
scsi layer and hotplug...

BTW: hotplug removing is still half broken: the hotplug remove event
is send only when the device is physically disconnected. If I remove
the sbp2 module with rmmod, I'll get nothing.
This means that if you do
	rmmod sbp2
	modprobe sbp2
your SCSI device will be lost and you'll have to call 'rescan-scsi-bus'
by hand...
