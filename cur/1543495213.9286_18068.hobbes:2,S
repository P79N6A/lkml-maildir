I don't see how your comment relates to what I was saying. All I am
saying is that my patch will slightly reduce the cost of goodness()
and hence will speed up schedule() noticably when there are many
entries on the run queue. You seem to be somehow disagreeing with what
I said, but I don't know what you are specifically disagreeing with.
You seem to be talking about something completely different.
