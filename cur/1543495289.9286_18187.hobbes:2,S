Hello,
it appears that I have several a.out binaries (from 1993!) that no longer
work with Linux 2.2.8-6 as well as some prepatches before that.
Those binaries work without problems in stock Linux 2.2.7.
It looks like the programs get a segfault after being started
through execve.
sz@zahn:~ $ strace file /usr/bin/which 
execve("/usr/bin/which", ["which", "time"], [/* 50 vars */]) = 0
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
sz@zahn:~ $ strace file /usr/bin/which 
execve("/usr/bin/file", ["file", "/usr/bin/which"], [/* 50 vars */]) = 0
--- SIGSEGV (Segmentation fault) ---
+++ killed by SIGSEGV +++
I placed the binaries at
  
http://www.snafu.de/~zahn/which
and
