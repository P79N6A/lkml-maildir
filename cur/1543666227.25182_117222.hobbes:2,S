As luck would have it, I kept that drive around, thinking it might be
interesting to have around if the above "why" part got revisited
someday.

Perhaps I can also act as the second owner in this case.  :-) The drive is 
currently in an old 16MB P133 on a PIIX3, so after tripping over this 
thread, I did some testing to 1st see if I could still re-create any 
problems in this different box.  Of note, 2.4.21pre5 reports:
hda: 1667232 sectors (854 MB) w/64KiB Cache, CHS=1654/16/63, BUG DMA OFF
                                        -------------------->^^^
which I haven't looked into yet. Anyway, I tweaked pre5 to re-allow 256
and then let it do two 2.5.64 compiles at the same time (in 16MB, this
takes a while) and nothing broke.  Thinking that the original problem was 
in an even older VLB box, I disabled DMA and did the same test. Still no
breakage.
What does this mean?  I'm not sure :)  Maybe this simple test isn't as
harsh as the prior one from several years ago.   Realistically, there 
are a fair number of changes that also may have a role: e.g.  ide driver, 
gcc, gas, kernel, CPU, mainboard, ide controller, PSU, cables, and so on 
all have changed.  It looks like I would need to jump back into the past 
and test on the exact same system and then progressively rule out some 
of these variables.
 
Paul.
