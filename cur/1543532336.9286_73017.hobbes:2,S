Indeed --- the SMP threading is one of the more pervasive changes
between 2.2 and 2.3.  A lot of people have worked on that, and the
VFS is much, much more scalable on SMP in 2.3 now.  That necessarily
makes life more complex for driver or filesystem writers, but there's
really no way to avoid that when you go for fine-grained SMP.
Cheers,
 Stephen
