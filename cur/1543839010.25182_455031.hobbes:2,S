I got 2.6.18-rc4-mm1 going, and it appears that system 
moves at about 3x normal speed.  A software clock need 3
seconds to advance 10 seconds, for example.
Everything else seems faster too, the keyboard autorepeat,
delay loops in games, and so on.  
Guess I could live with this, if it'd also compile
3x faster. :-/
This is a x86-64 kernel, with the jiffies hotfix applied.
