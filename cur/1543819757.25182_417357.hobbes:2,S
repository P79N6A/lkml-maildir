I'm really not going to apply this.
It's insane. 
"security_ops" is used by _anything_ that uses the inline functions in 
<linux/security.h>, which suddenly means that a non-GPL module cannot use 
_any_ of the standard security tests. That's insane.
And there's no point to this patch. The "explanation" I have seen so far 
is that some strange root-kit could take over the security ops. That's 
just crazy talk. If you're a root-kit, would you care about the copyright 
license? No. So this patch just makes zero sense from any standpoint.
If people want to remove security_ops, that's fine (not for 2.6.17, but 
assuming you guys can come to some reasonable agreement, at some later 
date). But turning it into a GPL-only, but leaving all the infrastructure 
requiring it is not.
