To me it seems logical and simplest to allow any accesses, lay out your 
structure and emulate it in the obvious way.
You can put the configuration information somewhere else, but the PCI config 
space seems the logical place.

No.  You need those status bits even if you have your register model, 
otherwise you can't tell when the configuration as a whole is stable.  
Consider the feature bits.  Worse, consider extending the feature bits beyond 
32 bits.
(We will have to deal with dynamic configuration changes in future; I was 
planning on using some status bits.  But it's pretty clear that it's going to 
require an explicit ack of some form.)
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
