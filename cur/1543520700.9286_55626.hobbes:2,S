Hi all,
 From some preliminary benchmarks I just conducted on my Winchip 2A-233,
Using 3dNow/MMX memcpy is a around 7-8 times faster than a plain
memcpy. This is however running on a 66Mhz bus, and the chip is designed
for running on a 100Mhz bus, so the real gain is probably much higher.
(I don't have a 100Mhz board to test this).
My initial thought, is to add an 'IDT Winchip' option to the CPU selection
menu of the config, which then sets the CONFIG_X86_USE_3DNOW
Comments?
Dave.
