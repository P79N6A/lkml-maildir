It's too early to draw conclusions about performance. I'm currently
performing more measurements, and the results are not easy to
interpret. My plan is to measure the following:
* Setup: target with RAM disk of 2 GB as backing storage.
* Throughput reported by dd and xdd (direct I/O).
* Transfers with dd/xdd in units of 1 KB to 1 GB (the smallest
transfer size that can be specified to xdd is 1 KB).
* Target SCSI software to be tested: IETD iSCSI via IPoIB, STGT iSCSI
via IPoIB, STGT iSER, SCST iSCSI via IPoIB, SCST SRP, LIO iSCSI via
IPoIB.
The reason I chose dd/xdd for these tests is that I want to measure
the performance of the communication protocols, and that I am assuming
that this performance can be modeled by the following formula:
(transfer time in s) = (transfer setup latency in s) + (transfer size
in MB) / (bandwidth in MB/s). Measuring the time needed for transfers
with varying block size allows to compute the constants in the above
formula via linear regression.
One difficulty I already encountered is that the performance of the
Linux IPoIB implementation varies a lot under high load
(
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9883
).
Another issue I have to look further into is that dd and xdd report
different results for very large block sizes (> 1 MB).
