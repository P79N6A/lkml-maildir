This sounds so familiar and similar to me, but with such a different
presentation. I ran about 15 hours yesterday with no xruns. Suddenly
at the end of the day I get about 8. I start up again this morning,
get two almost immediately, and then run the rest of the day with
none.
No HIGH_RES_TIMERS, with RT_PREEMPT.
Very strange.
Yesterday was 2.6.14-rt4. Today was -rt6.
