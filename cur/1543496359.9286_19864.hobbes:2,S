The main difference here is that suid bit isn't key in any way to privileges
in other trusted operating systems.  The forced and allowed sets on the
file itself are.  All the suid bit does on other trusted OSes is 
cause the program to get run as (possibly) another uid.  No privileges
are implied by suid bit (or uid O) on these systems. Here if you can
manage to remove the ELF headers some way, your security model falls 
apart.
