Before: 
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=107419912024246&w=2
The described attack works against user-friendly passwords.  People
who can remember long strings from /dev/random are safe.
After:
You compressed the known plaintext.  But the compressed known
plaintext remains known plaintext, just shorter.  If it remains longer
than one block of the block cypher, it is still sufficient for a
dictionary attack.  Nothing gained.
And of course it has to be at the beginning of a compression block, so
the offset is known in advance.

Ok, that makes the attack a little harder (but not much).  After any
amount of random data, you end up with a random huffman tree, agreed.
Compress another 1k of zeros and see what the huffman tree looks like
now.  There are not too many options, what the compressed data could
look like, right?  Somewhere in the ballpark of 2, 4 or maybe 8.
So now the attack takes twice as long.  Yeah, it helps a little, but
is it really worth the trouble?

I doubt it.  Maybe with a statistical encoding or even with block
sorting followed by statistical encoding, you increase the complexity
by much more than 8.  But without changes, the idea looks pretty
futile.

The 90% solution is a good thing.
