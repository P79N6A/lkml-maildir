That's the problem as understood by Adrian.
I hear another problem as well ...

That seems plain enough to me.  It's not just the lack of functionality,
but that such lack apparently happened with too little warning.
If this is a fair representation of what happened, then seems to me that
we could have left that EXPORT_UNUSED_SYMBOL(change_page_attr) in place
a bit longer.
Or at least, if we really did have to make Frans life difficult like
this, we could offer more appreciation for how things might look from
his perspective.
