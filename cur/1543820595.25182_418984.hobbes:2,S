No.  It's obviously slower than atomic_dec_and_test() if refcount is
greater than 1.  And I'm less than sure that you can show that benefits
in case when it is 1 outweight that.  Moreover, for dentries, inodes,
superblocks and vfsmounts you'd have to pull spin_lock() in front of
it, which would _definitely_ hurt (these are atomic_dec_and_lock()).
