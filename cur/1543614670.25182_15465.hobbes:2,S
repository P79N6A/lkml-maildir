It sounds like you get reiserfs corruptions easily, without crashing the 
machine or anythin unusual, and in that case you surely have hardware 
problems.  Please note in our FAQ the discussion of how reiserfs runs 
hotter than ext2, and it is common for improperly cooled CPUs to work 
well for ext2 and not reiserfs (tail combining heats the CPU).
