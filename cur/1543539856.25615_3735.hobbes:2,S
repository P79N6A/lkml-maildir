The source, of course. fs/ioctl.c says:
static int file_ioctl(struct file *filp,unsigned int cmd,unsigned long arg)
{
...
                        /* do we support this mess? */
                        if (!mapping->a_ops->bmap)
                                return -EINVAL;
                        if (!capable(CAP_SYS_RAWIO))
                                return -EPERM;
                        if ((error = get_user(block, (int *) arg)) != 0)
                                return error;
                        res = mapping->a_ops->bmap(mapping, block);
                        return put_user(res, (int *) arg);
which tells you all you need to know (including somebody's
opinion--and I think I know whose--about FIBMAP :-)

The capability. "Root", if no explicit action has been taken to
reduce root's privileges by default.

If you explained *why* you thought you wanted the number that bmap
gives you, maybe others would be able to think of a better way of
achieving your goal.

All SCSI and other high-end disks do this and I think some fancy
ATA ones do too (or soon will or something).
