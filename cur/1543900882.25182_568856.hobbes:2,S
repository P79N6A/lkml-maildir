Hi Jens,
I was hoping this patch would fix a different problem caused by the
same merge of 'splice-2.6.23' three days ago, but it didn't.
When I run nfsd on the latest git kernel, it serves up what seems to
be the wrong inodes for every fetched file.  I can navigate the served
directory structure with no problems, but the contents of any file I
fetch are completely unrelated to the real contents.
Does this suggest a possible cause or fix?
Thanks.
