Greetings --
I was using mplayer on an i686 2.4.19-ac4 just now, and it suddenly froze.  
That is to say, it wasn't entirely frozen -- if you moved the mouse and
waited ten seconds, the cursor would move. Accessing it from another
terminal (one that was already logged in), I could type at the rate of a
letter a minute. After a few minutes it resolved itself and came back to
normal.
/var/log/messages showed this:
kernel: Out of Memory: Killed process 9702 (gmplayer).
I've not encountered this in 2.4.16.
Cheers,
Peter
