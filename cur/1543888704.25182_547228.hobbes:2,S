OK, missed that one.

OK.

I was thinking that these wouldn't be needed, as MSI should stop
flowing along with everything else. However, there is a small race
window where the MSI was delivered on the PCI bus, then the error was
detected, and then the kernel delivers the MSI to device driver.
The if statements should close that gap.
I'll send an updated patch shortly.
