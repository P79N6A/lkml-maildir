The book "UNIX Systems for Modern Architectures" by Curt Schimmel discusses
read-write semaphores on page 234, he also has a prototype implementation,
based on "normal" semaphores.
The book suggests a per semaphore lock for internal variables.
The struct mr_lock looks like this (pseudo C)
struct mr_lock {
	semap_t	  m_lock;  /* protects the structure mr_lock */
	int	  m_rdcnt; /* # of active readers */
	int	  m_wrcnt; /* # of active writers, 0 or 1 */
	int	  m_rdwcnt; /* # of waiting reader */
	int	  m_wrcnt; /* # of waiting writers */
	waitqueue m_rdwait; /* waitqueue of waiting readers */	
	waitqueue m_wrwait; /* waitqueue of waiting writers */
}
Do you think an implementation based on this (and the other examples from
the book) is acceptable? Since the implementation uses already available
primitives, no assembly or other architecture-specific stuff is required.
