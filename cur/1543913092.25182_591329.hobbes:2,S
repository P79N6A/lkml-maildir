Hello,
It is because
"Add cmpxchg64 and cmpxchg64_local to mips" has been added to the
git-mips.patch, but it depends on 
"add-cmpxchg-local-to-generic-for-up.patch" which is not merged yet.
It was an error in my series file.
add-cmpxchg-local-to-generic-for-up.patch should come before these
patches:
i386-cmpxchg64-80386-80486-fallback.patch
add-cmpxchg64-to-alpha.patch
add-cmpxchg64-to-mips.patch
add-cmpxchg64-to-powerpc.patch
add-cmpxchg64-to-x86_64.patch
