2.6.21 with 2.6.20's maestro3.c with patch-maestro3-1 exhibited the same
issue. However, I identified the cause: maestro3 driver in 2.6.21 (even just
patch-maestro3-1) tries to load firmware file from user space. But each time
request_firmware is called it takes about 1 minute to timeout (because I
don't have the firmware installed?). If I let the system take its time, even
with maestro3.c from 2.6.21, it boots after timing out twice. So after about
2 minutes of no activity, system does boot. Following are trace messages I
added to identify the issue:
