	No, this is not what sched_yield means. What 'sched_yield' means is that 
you're at a point where it's convenient for another process to run. For 
example, perhaps you just released a mutex that you held for a long period of 
time, or perhaps you could function more efficiently if you could acquire a 
resource another thread holds.

	Perhaps to allow other threads to make forward progress. Perhaps to give 
other threads a chance to use a resource it just released. Perhaps in hopes 
that another thread will release a resource it could benefit from being able 
to acquire.
