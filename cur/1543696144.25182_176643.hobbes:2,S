I suspect sysfs would be a _good_ way to do it. I'm sure it could be 
screwed up too, but I don't think it would necessarily be wrong to be able 
to do
	echo imps2 > /sys/class/input/mouse/1/protocol
	echo 200 > /sys/class/input/mouse/1/rate
or something similar.

I'm a big believer in having the "default behaviour" be as user-friendly 
as possible. I do not believe in the mantra "we should do as little as 
possible, and let the user set everything up".

I think that's a failure. For one thing, you need the module to even _let_
the user select the mouse type: you can't seriously expect installers for
normal users to not run graphically and with a mouse already?
In general, module parameters are _always_ a sign of failure. I don't know
of a single one that can be considered a "good thing". They are sometimes
required, but they should be required only for hardware that is just very
fundamentally broken.
