I agree. I'll try to code it up in a way that its clear how to delete
this functionality when folk realize they no longer need it...
- -static inline int get_file_caps(struct linux_binprm *bprm)
+int cap_bprm_set_security(struct linux_binprm *bprm)
 {
 	bprm_clear_caps(bprm);
+	bprm_force_uid0_caps(bprm);
+	current->keep_capabilities = 0;

I'll look at it again, but I had thought I had preserved the previous
behavior with this condensed version of the code. Are you suggesting an
improvement to what was there, or pointing out I'm inadvertently
breaking the old behavior?
Thanks
Andrew
