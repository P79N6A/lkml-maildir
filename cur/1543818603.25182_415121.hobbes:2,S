Hi Jordan,
Better late than never, I guess...

I'm all for doing things the Right Way (TM) but in this case it seems
to make the code rather longer and slightly more complex. If you go
that way, wouldn't it be easier to have a proper pci driver?
On the code itself:
> -static int  __init scx200_acb_create(const char *text, int base, int index)
> +static int __init scx200_acb_create(char *text, unsigned int base, int index,
> +				    struct pci_dev *pdev, int bar)
Why are you removing that "const"? It looked alright to me.
Also, if you are changing base to be unsigned, you could make it an
unsigned long while you're at it - that's the type resource addresses
are supposed to be.

You could pass the error value returned by pci_request_region instead of
redefining your own.

It might not be a good idea to move away from pci_device_id. With it,
we could have made that module auto-loaded when the supported hardware
is found.

Use the ARRAY_SIZE macro instead please.

Eek. Changing broken coding style for even more broken coding style?
That initialization seems to be no more useful with the changes below,
BTW.

You could have made that change much smaller. What's the benefit of
swapping the order?
