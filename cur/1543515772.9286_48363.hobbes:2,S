Hello,
a i486 33MHz (20MB RAM, AHA1542 ISA with 1GB) running SuSE Linux 6.2 
as mailserver (77 days up) has the following problem:
Sep  3 07:00:45 kgate kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Nov 11 07:01:51 kgate kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Is it just saying that the dcahce is full? If that causes no more 
available inodes, that is bad. Maybe the dcache should not get all of 
them...
I'm running the kernel modified by SuSE (lx_suse-2.2.10.SuSE-2): 
Description :
Kernel sources with the following modifications:
- updated ISDN subsystem
- new aic7xxx driver 5.1.13
- internationalized kernel config
- updated network drivers
- driver for DAC960 and Compaq SMART2 RAID
At that time the might be running some of the periodic cron jobs and 
maybe one Perl script, but nothing great. The system isn't overloaded 
either:
idle  :  74d 11:49:06.95  95.6%  swap out:     2945
uptime:  77d 22:45:47.29         context : 83622282
Here is the current /proc/sys/fs status:

There were no other messages around the quoted two in the syslog:
Sep  3 07:00:22 kgate su: pam_unix session started for user nobody, 
service su
Sep  3 07:00:45 kgate kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Sep  3 07:04:28 kgate su: pam_unix session finished for user nobody, 
service su
Nov 11 07:01:26 kgate su: pam_unix session started for user nobody, 
service su
Nov 11 07:01:51 kgate kernel: grow_inodes: inode-max limit reached
Nov 11 07:05:40 kgate su: pam_unix session finished for user nobody, 
service su
The job at 7:00 is /etc/cron.daily/aaa_base that cleans up the 
filesystem, nothing very special...
Regards,
Ulrich
