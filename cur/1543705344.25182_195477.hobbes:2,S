Well, we could grab control of the machine, unconditionally move all
the threads and kill the cpu.
We'd need a lot of locks, but we could just use a bogolock (a-la
module.c's schedule a thread per cpu and tell them all to disable
interrupts) which has the same effect of grabbing every spinlock.
It means that kernel threads must not use smp_processor_id(), because
it might change under them (get_cpu() would protect from this).  You'd
still need explicit shutdown code.

No, migration code still needs to check the cpu is still up after
you've slept.
I'll sleep on it and see if it still sounds like a good idea in the
morning 8)
