I think there will be further discussion on this :)

struct pci_driver is going to become struct driver, don't forget.  With
that in mind, the "multifunction_quirks" patch appears even more of a
bus-specific hack.
Why do you want to dirty the soon-to-be generic driver API for stupid
hardware?
It takes two seconds to write a shim driver as I have described, and
further a shim driver is not necessary on sensible hardware.
