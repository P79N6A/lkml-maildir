After successfully compile and install the "make defconfig" of kernel
2.5.52, I got a strange keyboard problem.
I am using a standard 104 keys keyboard from Compaq.
I and having problems with the <'> (single quote) and <`> (back tick)
key.
The same problem exist for <"> (double quote) and <~> (tile) key.
The problem is, when I press any one of the above keys, continously, the
character will not show up in console.  One and only one pressed key
shows up once I press a different key other than the above 4.
All other keys are OK.  (I don't know how to test the Function keys!)
Any hints?
