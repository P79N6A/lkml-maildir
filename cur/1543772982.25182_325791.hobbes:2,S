Ha! There's even another problem that I just noticed.  it_real_value
could return zero while the function is running! So you don't get the
protection here either!  Take a look here to see what the problem is.
static unsigned long it_real_value(struct signal_struct *sig)
{
	unsigned long val = 0;
	if (timer_pending(&sig->real_timer)) {
		val = sig->real_timer.expires - jiffies;
		/* look out for negative/zero itimer.. */
		if ((long) val <= 0)
			val = 1;
	}
	return val;
}
and 
static inline int timer_pending(const struct timer_list * timer)
{
	return timer->base != NULL;
}
and
static inline void __run_timers(tvec_base_t *base)
{
  ...
			timer = list_entry(head->next,struct timer_list,entry);
 			fn = timer->function;
 			data = timer->data;
			list_del(&timer->entry);
			set_running_timer(base, timer);
			smp_wmb();
			timer->base = NULL;
			spin_unlock_irq(&base->lock);
			{
				u32 preempt_count = preempt_count();
				fn(data);
...
}
So, timer_pending tests if timer->base is NULL, but here we see that
timer->base IS NULL before the function is called, and as I have said
earlier, the it_real_arm can be called on two CPUS simultaneously. So
here's another patch that should fix this race condition too.
