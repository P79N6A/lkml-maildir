Thank you for answering.
I understand that there are some devices that need to be enabled
even after their drivers are unloaded, and my approach might not
be safe in this case. I think the best way to solve the problem
(missing pci_disable_device) is to fix broken drivers one by one.
I think debug printk will helpful to fix those drivers, but I
don't know what kind of message is appropriate...
Thanks,
