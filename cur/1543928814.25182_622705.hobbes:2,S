No, it doesn't.

With idle=poll nothing changes, except that - as soon as I switch the CPU
frequency - I get this in the logs:
[  297.562722] Marking TSC unstable due to: cpufreq changes.
[  297.566677] Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
With idle=halt, changing frequency just freezes the system. I can't even use
the magic Sys Rq keys then.
I observed another thing. When I don't use any of the parameters you
suggested for debugging, I get this at boot:
[    6.530752] Marking TSC unstable due to: possible TSC halt in C2.
[    6.530761] Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
[    6.620700] Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = -456217276 ns)
