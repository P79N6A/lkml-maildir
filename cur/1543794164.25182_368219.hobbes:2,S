Just a guess - perhaps the following clarifies this point of confusion:
The "changelog" isn't so much for what you've changed, relative to the
previous version of that patch.  It is for what will go into the Linux
change history for this patch, when accepted.
To quote Documentation/SubmittingPatches, which calls this the
"explanation body":
    The explanation body will be committed to the permanent source
    changelog, so should make sense to a competent reader who has long
    since forgotten the immediate details of the discussion that might
    have led to this patch.
