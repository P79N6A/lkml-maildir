That only covers normal system calls - but I don't think thats what is
relevant, taints are for debug assistance not politics.
I think we should have a taint flag for UIO type drivers. Not for any
licensing or political reason but for the simple fact it means that there
may be other complexities to debugging - and not the same one as a binary
module. Probably we want the same marker for mmap /dev/mem too.
