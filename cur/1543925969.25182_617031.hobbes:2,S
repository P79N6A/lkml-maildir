I hate to punt on this, but I'm not doing anything that acpiphp
is not doing. If we get back non-unique values for _SUN, I'm
pretty sure both acpiphp and my pci_slot driver will both
continue along as far as they can, until they get an error back
from kobject_register() about trying to register an object with
an existing name.
I think I may have a machine that has non-unique values for _SUN.
If so, I'll try and hunt it down and do some testing.
Thanks for the suggestion.
