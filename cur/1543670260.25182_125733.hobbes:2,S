In the patch that went to marcelo a few days ago the reset
argument to ip_chain_procinfo() got removed, but there's still
a code block inside the function that references that variable.
This patch gets rid of that (presumably old) code block. Note
that I didn't cc this to Marcelo because I'm not 100% sure, so
please check it.
