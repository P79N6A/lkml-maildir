If the hardware can manage it then that's great (and mapping the buffers
into user space would still be nice if the hardware supported it, to
save having to copy everything into the kernel buffers). However, some
cards may not support hardware mixing of sufficient multiple buffers, in
which case sending things via a daemon seems a rather heavyweight
solution.
