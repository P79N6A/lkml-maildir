Thanks for the report, I'll look into it.
Note that _any_ fbcon device may have problems with svgalib and XFree86,
because neither are aware of fbcon and the hardware it manages at all --
unless you are using XF86_FBDev of course.
For more information on setting up an environment with fbdev, see the
