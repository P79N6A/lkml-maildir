  Lint isn't and never will be a Standard C compiler. Imagine I wrote this:
#include <stdio.h>
void main()
{
  printf("You're code as an error\n");
}
  Then apply this program to whatever code you wrote, do you really would
think you're code is actually buggy?

  Obviously, the value of a *is* tested.
  Do you remember that, in C, every statement has a value (that could be void)?
  That's means:
  a=b; which *is* a statement has a value (the assigned value)
  that's why
  c=a=b; makes a and then c getting the value of b;
  because
  c=a=b; is *strictly* equivalent to c=(a=b); or (c=(a=b)); or ((c=(a=b));

  I really don't see why you're saying it should always be TRUE.
  The only things 'if' does it evaluating what is between the parentheses
and check if is zero or not. And what is in the parentheses is a statement,
and such HAS a value, which for an assignment IS the ASSIGNED value.
  
  The same way
  if (a?b:c)
  doesn't test if the '?' test succeed (what would that mean anyway?)
  but test if (a is non-zero and b is non zero) or (a is zero and c is non zero)
  the parentheses aren't needed because a?b:c IS a statement and HAS a value,
  the same way as a=b IS a statement and HAS a value.

  The evaluation of expressions have (hopefully) nothing to do with
  sequence points.

  I really cannot understand how someone like you, who often write into
this list, doesn't know how a C compiler work. You seam to be a smart man,
so you should have misread the standards.
