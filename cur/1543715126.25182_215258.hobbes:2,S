I'm aware of the existence of such features, I just think it's yet to
be demonstrated that they're actually a good idea for real deployment
by themselves. ext3+{btree,extents} is not backwards compatible in any
useful sense, unlike features such as journalling, directory hashing,
sparse superblocks, wandering journals, etc. Given that you can't
mount the new filesystem with an old kernel, not changing the name can
only result in confusion.
But I see your point about dealing with a cartesian product of
features. So if and when this stuff approaches beta, we should
probably use the feature flags _and_ change the name to something like
ext3+be (btrees, extents) or ext3+i (inode in file) to indicate the
presence of experimental, incompatible features, and when the feature
set is actually pinned down, rename it simply ext3+ or ext4 or whatever.
It might be possible to have ext4 actually be a family of filesystems
where extents or large inodes are optional, but I suspect the value of
that would be minimal and again, all such features would have to be
available in every kernel tree that claimed to support ext4.
