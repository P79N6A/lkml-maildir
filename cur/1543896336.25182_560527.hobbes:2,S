Yes, and no.
Yes, force_sig() unblocks and un-ignores the signal. However, unlike group-wide
signals, thread-specific signals do not convert themselves to SIGKILL on delivery.
The target thread should dequeue SIGSEGV and then it calls do_group_exit().
Before it does so, another thread doing signal(SIGSEGV, SIG_IGN) can steal
the signal.
Of course, this is unlikely, and the target thread will take page fault again.
The same for signalfd.
Oleg.
