I quite agree with you that the description is already there, but such 
flags could help easily review or grep commits in order to identify your 
areas of interest.
Even your example has ambiguity: "Wire up new timerfd syscalls" - It's 
not easy to understand whether this particular commit is a bugfix, or it 
speeds up things, or the old code which has been cleaned up, etc.
