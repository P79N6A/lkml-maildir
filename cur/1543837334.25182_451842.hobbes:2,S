Debian testing has it installed already, so I tried that one.
# s2ram
Machine is unknown.
This machine can be identified by:
    sys_vendor   = "IBM"
    sys_product  = "288679U"
    sys_version  = "ThinkPad G41"
    bios_version = "1XET44WW (1.03 )"
See 
http://en.opensuse.org/S2ram
 for details.
If you report a problem, please include the complete output above.
So then I tried s2ram -f
Well it went to sleep fine.  But when I tried to wake it up again, the
screen didn't come back. I'm not sure if the keyboard was working either.
But I could eject the CD and when I put it back in, it seemed to mount it.
Oh well, I'll have to debug that another day ;)
