Check out your .config with less, more, an editor, or whatever, and you
should have a line like:
#
# General setup
#
# CONFIG_MATH_EMULATION is not set
CONFIG_MEM_STD=y
# CONFIG_MEM_ENT is not set
# CONFIG_MEM_SPECIAL is not set
CONFIG_MAX_MEMSIZE=1024
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If that's not defined in the .config, you will have problems with symbols.
BTW, I just built and booted 2.0.37pre4, no problems :)
