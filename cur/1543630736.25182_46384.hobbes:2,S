This is getting ridiculous all right.
Linus, what makes you ignore Keith's work?
Would you tend to think he's worked on kbuild25 this long
to end up having to send a linus-dammit-would-you-have-
-a-look-at-last-i'm-not-going-to-keep-asking-forever msg?
Sorry for a slightly offensive post; I can't stand to
see such impoliteness.
