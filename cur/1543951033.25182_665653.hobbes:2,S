I had once a bad ram-module and even after heavy search didn't came across 
memmap or its usage. Together with memtest86 badram= is pretty usable.
So for usability's sake i strongly vote for badram=  - good name, quite good 
to use. If you wanna tune on the internal implementation - thats fine ;) .
