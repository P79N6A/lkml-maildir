Hi folks,
I've got a problem with a Samsung SATA dvd writer: It
doesn't play video DVDs. If I connect the same drive
via an adapter to USB, then there is no such problem.
dmesg says:
ata2.00: exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x2 frozen
ata2.00: (BMDMA stat 0x1)
ata2.00: tag 0 cmd 0xa0 Emask 0x4 stat 0x40 err 0x0 (timeout)
ata2: soft resetting port
ata2: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 310)
ata2.00: model number mismatch 'TSSTcorpCD/DVDW SH-S183A' != 'ÑÅÌhõ³Nõ
This is reproducible.
lspci:
01:07.0 RAID bus controller: Silicon Image, Inc. SiI 3512 [SATALink/SATARaid] Serial ATA Controller (rev 01)
01:07.0 0104: 1095:3512 (rev 01)
/proc/scsi/scsi:
Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: TSSTcorp Model: CD/DVDW SH-S183A Rev: SB01
  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI SCSI revision: 05
I already asked Samsung's hotline for a firmware update,
but there is none available. They haven't heard of this
problem before, either. My wild guess would be that this
is a driver problem.
Kernels tried: 2.6.19.1, 2.6.18.3
What would be your suggestion to track down this problem?
Regards
Harri
