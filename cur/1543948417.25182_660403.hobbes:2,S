Yes, the X.Org developers are making major changes ATM and there have
definitely been regressions because of them.
Best way to find out is to check whether booting with an earlier kernel
solves the problem. If it does, it's most likely a kernel issue. If it
does not, it's most likely an X.Org issue.

This sounds like that could be a bug I filed recently and which was solved
in 2.2.1:
