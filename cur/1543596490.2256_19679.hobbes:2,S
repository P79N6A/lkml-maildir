I was wondering how I can increase the process address space, TASK_SIZE
(PAGE_OFFSET), in the current kernel. It looks like the 3 GB value is
hardcoded in a couple of places and is thus not trivial to alter. Is
there any good reason to limit this value at all, why not just have it
be the same as the max addressable space (64 GB)? We have an ix86 SMP
box with 4 GB of RAM and want to be able to allocate all of it to a
single program (physics simulation). I would greatly appreciate any help
on this.
Thanks a great deal,
Ernie
