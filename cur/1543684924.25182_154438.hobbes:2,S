It worked fine under 2.6.0-test2-mm2 and 2.6.0-test2-mm1.   With some 
further investigating, it seems that usbmouse is not loaded at startup, 
just hid.  Following your suggestion, I removed both and just loaded hid 
and the mouse works ok, for a short period of time.  Eventually it stops 
and I have to rmmod hid and reload load it.   Sometimes I get a decent 
amount of time (maybe 30 minutes or so) before it sticks.  I'm turning 
on USB_DEBUG and will rebuild to see if I get any more helpful info.
