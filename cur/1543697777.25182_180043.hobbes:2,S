I consider this a bug. If they don't use the memory, don't alloc
it. It's not the responsibility of the kernel to determine whether the
programmer was sane. If the programmer was sane, then he may well have
been trying to keep some memory availble for emergency use, and
wouldn't want his program dying from an untrapable kill signal. 
Or he was just lazy, and if he's lazy enough to allocate too much
memory, he'll also be lazy enough to "forget" to check for malloc()s
return value, and hence his program will crash when derefencing
NULL. Bug reports will be filed against his application, like it was
meant to, because it was his fault. Not the kernel's.
Hence 2 should be the default. 
0 should be left for those poor fools who run closed source software,
and can't get their vendor to fix their bugs, so need to use some
kernel kludges (ie, overcommit) to get around it.
