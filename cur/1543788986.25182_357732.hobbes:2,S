Yes, thanks. I had that backwards. I am checking for the illegal
combination of "shared sighand + unshared vm" later but I will
allow (and test) unsharing of sighand while keeping shared vm.

Ok. Basically, with my current logic you are forced to unshare
both vm and sighand. I will update so you can unshare just sighand
and tie the CLONE_THREAD restriction to sighand.

Yes, I did see that async ios are tied to an mm and that aio context is
cleared when a new mm is created by clone/exec. It just appeared odd to
me that a task that setup aio is unable to continue performing aio
after unsharing mm, but the task that it was sharing mm with, can. I
don't have any problem making this change. It's just that I wasn't sure
about aio usage and thought it was better to not allow an mm unshare if
aio is being performed.
