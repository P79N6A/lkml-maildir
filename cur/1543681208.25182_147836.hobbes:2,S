Dear Mr. Tosatti,
I've been asked by Mr. Francois Romieu, the author of
drivers/net/wan/dscc4.c,
to give you a summary of my user-space experience with recent versions
of dscc4.c and the Generic HDLC Layer (drivers/net/wan/hdlc_*.c, hdlc.o).
The message is: it works, to the extent that it can be configured and
TCP/IP works. I've tried DSCC4 hardware back-to-back and against
a Cisco, in a few different configurations. I've tried the three basic
encapsulations: cisco-hdlc, itu-hdlc and sync ppp.
I don't know enough FR and X.25 to be able to come up with a workable
setup (didn't even try).
I was using linux 2.4.21-rc1 and 2.4.21 (release). This works, but that
version of dscc4.c suffers from a hardware quirk in the DSCC4 hardware
- the port/link cannot be reconfigured without a cold reboot.
The effects of this quirk are alleviated by a patch to dscc4.c that has been
submitted by F.Romieu for approval to the linux kernel and that reportedly
has made i to the -ac series, but not to the vanilla 2.4.21.
I have not touched the sources of the Generic HDLC Layer (hdlc*.c) that is
present in 2.4.21-rc1 to 2.4.21. I was using the vanilla source without
modification. I don't know about any differences in the hdlc*.c in the -ac
series - I didn't investigate that flavor.
As for the userspace sethdlc.c by Krzystof Halasa: I was using ver.1.12,
modified by Mr. Romieu, who has "cut some non-compiling functionality."
The current version from Krzysztof Halasa is 1.15.
I barely had the time to test basic workability and document my test bench.
Unfortunately I did not do any stress/long-term/feature-crosscompatibility
testing.
Specifically, I was using uniprocessor machines only (no SMP).
I did not test all the features available in the Generic HDLC Layer, I don't
even
fully understand all the technologies covered - I was only interested in
basic
point-to-point IP over sync serial.
I've written a short mini-HOWTO - the chapter on test results in terms of
transfer rates and ping round trips is at
http://sweb.cz/Frantisek.Rysanek/sync/dscc4
+HDLC-Mini-HOWTO.html#Drivers.ope
n.tests
I hope that I was not completely wasting your time :-)
If you have further questions, ask me.
Thanks for the great job that you're doing.
Sincerely yours
Frank Rysanek
