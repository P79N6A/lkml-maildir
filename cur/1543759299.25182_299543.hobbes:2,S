Yes, I think you need to use some threshold when reporting BTN_TOUCH
event. Still, always report ABS_PRESSURE as is. This way the
touchscreen is useable via legacy interfaces (mousedev. tsdev) and if
a specialized userspace driver is written it still can get pretty much
unmangled data from /dev/input/eventX. This will also allow such
driver adjust touchpad sensitivity, if needed.

No, not physical sizes. I was wondering if soe touchscreens are
reporting let's say actual coordinates from 1100-3600 and others from
600-3850, instead of full 0-4096. Is there a way to query the hardware
and find the actual min and max for a device so it can be reported to
userspace.
