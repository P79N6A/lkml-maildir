I have a simple suggestion: When asserting that an OS has "real time"
capabilities, include  either the adjective "hard" and supply a time
worst case interrupt latency on a representative hardware platform or
include "soft" and supply a characterization of "typical" interrupt
latencies and worst case number of violations.

Nops cost too but RTLinux V3 in the x86 does do some on-line code
patching for Linux so that we can keep the Linux mods simple and 
pay a time cost only when we move into RT mode.
