I wasted some time on thinking about how this pnp_resource_change and
pnp_manual_config_dev could get workarounded..., but it's impossible
without changing the (more a workaround than an) interface.
If you worked on this already, would you mind ripping these out?
If I understand Takashi correctly, the driver code using
pnp_resource_change and pnp_manual_config_dev can simply be removed and
devices could get resources assigned via sysfs "set" interface.
Thanks,
