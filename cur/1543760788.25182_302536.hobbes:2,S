Btw, Stas, one thing I'd really like to see is even a partial list of 
anything that actually cares about this. Ie, if there is some known 
Windows app where Wine works better or something like that, just adding 
that information to the comments would be hugely appreciated. 
Another way of saying the same thing: I absolutely hate seeing patches 
that fix some theoretical issue that no Linux apps will ever care about. 
So I'd like to have a bit more of a case for this patch, since I know what 
the case against it is ;)
