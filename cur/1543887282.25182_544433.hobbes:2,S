While I'm all for keeping things relatively stable and not asking the
user to constantly upgrade user-space, I believe that we just can't
promise to never break user-level interfaces while keeping the
development pace we have right now. We can promise to grant people
significant delay before we drop compatibility options, but "forever"
doesn't scale.
If you really want to enforce the "never" rule, be prepared to either
see development slow down and finally come to a stop, or see the code
become unmaintainable and insecure and nobody is longer willing to work
on it.

You seem to assume that I remembered myself about this option when I
first replied. I wish it were true :(
