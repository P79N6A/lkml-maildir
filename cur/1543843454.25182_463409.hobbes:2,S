the argument is very simple: LTT creates strong coupling, it is almost a 
set of 350+ system-calls, moved into the heart of the kernel. Once moved 
in, it's very hard to remove it. "Why did you remove that trace 
information, you broke my LTT script!"
While with SystemTap the coupling is alot smaller. With dynamic tracing 
there's no _fundamental requirement_ for _any_ tracepoint to be in the 
source code, hence we have the present and future flexibility to 
eliminate most of them. So my point is: shape all the static tracepoints 
in a "provide data to dynamic tracers" way. If they are removed (which 
we should have the freedom to do), the removal is not a showstopper.
Flexibility of future choices, especially for user/developer-visible 
features, is one of the most important factors of kernel maintainance.
