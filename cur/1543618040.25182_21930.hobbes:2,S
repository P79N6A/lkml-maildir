and quite often the user has unloaded / loaded modules in the meantime
and the oops is useless.
It would be nice if klogd's oops detection just passed everything to ksymoops
untouched, and stored everything somewhere using -m
I don't see any reason why the internal profiler can't have an extended EIP
range to catch module samples either. Perhaps I'm missing something. Perhaps
no one cares enough ...
