That whole site is unfortunately completely unmaintained. I'll probably pull the plug on the entire thing in the near future.
I'm afraid the only card I'm using actively is the Marvell 8686. Of my collection, it's the only one working well enough to do anything useful.

Not much. Atheros 6001 support is on its way (OpenMoko has this chip, so they're looking at it). The chip unfortunately seems to be a bit misdesigned when it comes to timeouts so it has problems initializing. I have no idea what the current status is.
I also have a Socket wifi card, but they haven't shown any interest in providing specs, so it's just a paperweight right now.

Well, full MAC is probably a must when it comes to SDIO. The bus is simply too slow and too high-latency to get any decent software MAC running.
