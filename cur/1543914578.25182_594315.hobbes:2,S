Maybe you still don't realize how tiresome it is to talk to you.
What you present as "linuxtv people block my contributions" is
IMHO "linuxtv people got fed up talking to you". Because when
people disagree with you, you keep rambling on and on instead
of just accepting it. See, working with an Open source community
requires that you don't piss everyone off, but instead find
ways to _motivate_ them to help you fix the problems which
prevent your code from being merged. When people are doing
software development _for fun_, then it should be a _pleasure_
for them to work with you, and not a pain in the ass.
You code and your arguments in this discussion may be
different than before, but the thread follows a familiar
pattern and will likely go nowhere, just like the many
discussions before.
