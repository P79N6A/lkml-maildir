Subject: [PATCH 1/1] user namespaces: document CFS behavior
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/8/299

Documented the currently bogus state of support for CFS user groups with
user namespaces.  In particular, all users in a user namespace should be
children of the user which created the user namespace.  This is yet to
be implemented.

+8. Implementation note: user namespaces
+
+User namespaces are intended to be hierarchical.  But they are currently
+only partially implemented.  Each of those has ramifications for CFS.
+
+First, since user namespaces are hierarchical, the /sys/kernel/uids
+presentation is inadequate.  Eventually we will likely want to use sysfs
+tagging to provide private views of /sys/kernel/uids within each user
+namespace.
+
+Second, the hierarchical nature is intended to support completely
+unprivileged use of user namespaces.  So if using user groups, then
+we want the users in a user namespace to be children of the user
+who created it.
+
+That is currently unimplemented.  So instead, every user in a new
+user namespace will receive 1024 shares just like any user in the
+initial user namespace.  Note that at the moment creation of a new
+user namespace requires each of CAP_SYS_ADMIN, CAP_SETUID, and
+CAP_SETGID.
