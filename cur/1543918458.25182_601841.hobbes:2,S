Subject: [PATCH 14/51] [GFS2] invalid metadata block - REVISED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Bob Peterson <rpeterso@redhat.com>
This is for bugzilla bug #248176: GFS2: invalid metadata block
Patches 1 thru 3 were accepted upstream, but there were problems
with 4 and 5.  Those issues have been resolved and now the recovery
tests are passing without errors.  This code has gone through
41 * 3 successful gfs2 recovery tests before it hit an
unrelated (openais) problem.
This is a complete rewrite of patch 4 for bug #248176.
Part of the problem was that inodes were being recycled
before their buffers were flushed to the journal logs.
Another problem was that the clone bitmaps were being
searched for deleted inodes to recycle, but only the
"real" bitmaps should be searched for that purpose.
