are you really sure about this ?  where can I check those dma modes ?
isn't mode4 UDMA66 ?

I've tried this before and it didn't improve performace.
just tried again, here is the output:
	# ./hdparm -X66 /dev/hda
	/dev/hda:
	 setting xfermode to 66 (UltraDMA mode2)
and max. performace still is 16 MB/sec:(
so now I've tried
	# ./hdparm -X67 /dev/hda
	/dev/hda:
	 setting xfermode to 67 (UltraDMA mode3)
and
	# ./hdparm -X68 /dev/hda
	/dev/hda:
	 setting xfermode to 68 (UltraDMA mode4)
which gives the following kernel messages:
	ide0: Speed warnings UDMA 3/4 is not functional.
	ide0: Speed warnings UDMA 3/4 is not functional.
and `hdparm -I' and performace tests still show `UDMA mode 2' (16 MB/sec)
how can I set other DMA modes ?
the drive gives 28MB/sec with another main board and my main board/chipset
is specified to support UDMA33, so what's wrong ?!
here are the decoded settings for my VIA chipset:

my best guess still is that this `4T' cycle time is wrong,
but even if I change this using `pcitweak -w 0:7:1 -b 0x53 0x60' 
from XFree86 4.0 giving

the performace doesn't change/improve:(
thanks for any further hint,
