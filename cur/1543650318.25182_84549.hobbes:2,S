Why would it be dead? Have you even tried to look at www.coda.cs.cmu.edu,
and looked at any of the mailinglist archives? Let alone subscribe and
post a question.
Have you noticed that several kernel patches for Coda have been merged
both in the 2.4.19 and 2.5.42 kernels, that last patch went in about 18
days ago..
