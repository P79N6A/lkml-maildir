I did the opposite : I tried hg as soon as Matt announced it, but I
got lost in the "python dumps" which appeared at the slightest error,
because I did not understand what the problem was. Then I tried git,
at least to be able to keep in sync with Marcelo. With git, I had
some opportunities to catch some understandable error messages spit
out of some shell scripts even when not caught by the script itself.
But using it less than twice a week requires me to read the manual
again before doing anything useful :-(
