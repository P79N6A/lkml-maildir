Right.  If the first condition of a logical AND statement is false,
the remainder need not be evaluated at all.  Hence, the entire if
statement can (and perhaps should) be eliminated by the compiler,
since the condition is false.
I didn't see what the actual message from the compiler was, but it
was probably just a warning.
