You need to have a modern compiler. The "heaps of errors" is what you get 
if you use a stone-age compiler that doesn't support anonymous structure 
and union members or other C99 features.
Gcc has supported them since some pre-3.x version (which is pretty late,
since they've been around in other compilers for much longer). They are a
great way to make readable data structures that have internal structure
_without_ having to have that structure show up unnecessarily in usage.
