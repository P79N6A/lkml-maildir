That's pretty much what I figure.  The one issue is that on non-PAE 
32-bit (or if we actually have to deal with unsharable PMDs on PAE 
kernels) then the PGD (PMD) kernel mappings at least formally should 
really be put in sync.  This could be done either by the same code which 
keeps the PGDs of various processes in sync already or on demand; I 
believe my personal preference would be to have all that in the same 
place, since we have to do it anyway, and this is nothing different 
except for the offset.
