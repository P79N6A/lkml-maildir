Well, that's a small (but known!) problem with this scheme.
If you say that everything below a directory "_crypt_" should be
encrypted, and just move files in there, you've got no problems - the
encryption settings stay the same.
If you move in/out of encrypted storage, there's two options:
- if it's a separate filesystem, ie. mounted, you cannot move - you
  have to copy & delete, which means the data gets correct settings.
- if its not the same filesystem, you might get a wrongly en/decrypted
  file.
But I just saw ecryptfs (
http://ecryptfs.sourceforge.net/
) - that seems to
do more or less what I need. I'll take a look.
Regards,
Phil
