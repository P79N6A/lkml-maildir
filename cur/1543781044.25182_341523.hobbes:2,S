Dear Lennart,
Thanks for the immediate reply.
Please see inline comments.

When I said mount, I guess FAT will read sector 0 to get the partition
info. And is it due to lack of partition support in the driver that will
affect the FAT layer reading the device.
Please update?

Yes, right, my card size if 16 MB. FS type is FAT12.

The SD card has partitions on it (both: cam, windows).
So, my device node accessing is direct. 
You can see below the SD card has a single primary partition.
So, I say "mount -tvfat /dev/tfa0 /mnt" which works for windows
formatted SD.
The same does NOT work with CAM formatted SD.
Sfdisk -l /dev/tfa0 ( CAM & win)
Disk /dev/tfa0: 448 cylinders, 2 heads, 32 sectors/track
Units = cylinders of 32768 bytes, blocks of 1024 bytes, counting from 0
   Device Boot Start     End   #cyls    #blocks   Id  System
/dev/tfa0p1   *      0+    449     450-     14371+   1  FAT12
/dev/tfa0p2          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
/dev/tfa0p3          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
/dev/tfa0p4          0       -       0          0    0  Empty
Warning: partition 1 extends past end of disk
I don't understand, what is /dev/tfa0p1? I have no such device.

Will you please elaborate this?
What kind of partition support is required in the driver to support the
Camera Fat12 formatted SD Card?
I dumped the 1st sector of SD when formatted on CAM.
I have attached the files. Please have a look at them
	Cluster-0.txt - First 16 Blocks of the device
	Phy-Cam-57-sector.txt - 57th sector of the device (claimed FAT
sector
in Partition table)
