No, there no problem writing a loader.  All you need is to create
anonymous mappings.  Via mmap, maybe on the stack, some heaps are
still executable.  Then you load the code, fix it up for the address,
and be done.  The kernel cannot and will not prevent a read(2) call on
the binary.  That's all that's needed.  And without the SELinux
support in place you cannot prevent non-exec memory creation and even
then, some people need it (jvms, OpenGL libs, etc) to generate code on
the fly.  So it's never completely ruled out.  Again, look at the code
in 
http://people.redhat.com/drepper/selinux-mem.html.
Given you have executable anonymous memory it is a one-time small
effort to write a loader and you're done.  Nothing your signature
detection code can do about it.  This is snake oil.
