In my attempts to investigate whether or not my m/b is afflicted by the
VIA KT266 hardware bug at device 1106:3099 register 0x95, bits 5,6,7, I
have a dumb question:  Namely, how are bits numbered?
I would assume that bits are numbered from smallest value to largest,
indexed at 0, so that bit 7 is the '128' component of a byte and bit 0 is
the '1' component.. correct?
