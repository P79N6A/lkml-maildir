i cant seem to be able to reproduce the 'bad' behavior on 2.2.8: 
  [mingo@moon lo]$ time ./badguy
  I'm a good boy.
  ..........4.66 user 0.41 system 0:05.07 elapsed 99%CPU
  [mingo@moon lo]$ time ./badguy bad
  I'm a *BAD* boy! And bad boys know that jiffie is 20msec
  ..........4.66 user 0.43 system 0:05.12 elapsed 99%CPU
  [mingo@moon lo]$
(i've tried it both on SMP and UP boxes) In both cases the kernel says
we've spent almost 100% as user-time. (are you sure 2.2 still has this
problem? I saw your(?) timer tick accounting fix half a year ago, and i
thought it went into the kernel, but i could be wrong.)
