Since flush_state has a spinlock, an array of flush_states would end up
having multiples spinlocks on the same L1 cacheline.  However, I see that
the union smp_flush_state is already padded to SMP_CACHE_BYTES.
With per-cpu areas,  locks belonging to different array elements did
not end up on the same internode cacheline due to per-node allocation of
per-cpu areas, but with a simple array, two locks could end up on the same
internode cacheline.
Hence, can you please change the padding in smp_flush_state to
INTERNODE_CACHE_BYTES (you have to derive this off INTERNODE_CACHE_SHIFT)
and align it using ____cacheline_internodealigned_in_smp?
