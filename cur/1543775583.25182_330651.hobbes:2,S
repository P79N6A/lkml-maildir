I beg to disagree. More and more devices have generic connectivity plug
(USB, 1394, ...) and you may update your firmware because you support a
new device connected to this plug that is not a generic device (specific
driver needed) but you may also have provisionned generic devices
drivers for the plug and want devices created only when device is
plugged (usb mass storage comes in mind). If I make a static /dev
provision for a USB disk how many useless partition will I need to
create, and how will I mount the correct number of partition without
hotplug like feature and analysing by hand the partition table?

Not sure. It is a debian sid install.
Thanks anyone who responded. I'll be unable to read mails for a while.
