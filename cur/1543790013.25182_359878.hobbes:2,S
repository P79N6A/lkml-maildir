Wouldn't it be better to eliminate pci_driver's .owner field and
set the generic device driver's owner field directly? (and fix
the PCI code not to overwrite that if pci_driver's .owner field
is NULL for compatibility.)
I ask for the second time recently on linux-kernel.  Is there
*really* any point in duplicating these fields?
