They only reason I know so fare that compilation could fail for zImage
and NOT for bzImage is that the kernel gets to big. So, if 'make zImage'
fails and there is no message 'kernel to big' it should be in the
'common part', right ? So I think it's much easier to use the log file
that I've saved anyway and look for this message: 'kernel too big'.
The advantage for this is:
- don't need a patch for the Makefile (VERY IMPORTANT, think of
newcomers)
- don't need to know so much about what really happens during make
(b)zImage and
  you are not affected by any changes
Disadvantages:
- mkkrl is lost when someone find the message 'kernel too big' boring
and replaces
  it with 'kernel IS too big'
- if someone gives a message with 'kernel too big' in it mkkrl mistakes
this
  as our bzImage flag
But I think it's ok.

This might be a good idea, I haven't thought of people not using
modules.

Yes and no. Looking at your script I can see that you assume that you
don't need to
(re)make a dep and clean as you don't use it after zImage fails.
But my question was to be accurate: Is there ANY case that zImage fails
with 'kernel too big' where you should do a 'make dep' or 'make clean'
before 'make bzImage' ?

I haven't thought of the 2nd. You are right, but still ... for people
who just want to get a lean kernel it could be easier ...
E.g.: I wanted to use my SB PCI 64V sound card and I'm STILL not sure
which options I have to set. There are so many contradicting statements
in the internet.
Best wishes,
