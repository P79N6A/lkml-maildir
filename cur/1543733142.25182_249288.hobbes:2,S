  No, not with the current setup with file-as-dir. It also works in
  Gnome/Natilus. Just tested:
  mkdir test
  chmod +x test
  cd test
  dir metas
  echo 0777>rwx
  In Nautilus I just typed in in the address bar /test/metas/
  I could open meta-data and change with GEdit too.
  I do not see that I have had to patch any programs to get this to
  work.
