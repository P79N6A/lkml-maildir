Your union is right, and my casting lazy, no question of that.
It's just that we'd need to do a whole lot of cosmetic edits
to get fully building trees, distracting from the guts of it.
In my case, anyway, the number of places that actually use the
casting are very few (just rmap.c?), suspect it's same for you.
I'm certainly not arguing against sanity checks where needed,
just against treewide edits (or broken builds) for now.

Thanks a lot.  I don't imagine you've done the nonlinear vma case
