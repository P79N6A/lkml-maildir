Subject: [PATCH] [2/5] Use 2000 offset for 32bit kernels
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/9/140

We know it is already after 2000.
This extends the effective lifetime of 32bit systems by 8 years:
from 2030 to 2038.
The only drawback is that users cannot set the cmos date to before 2000
now on 32bit with systems that don't support extended century in 
the RTC clock. 64bit systems had this limitation for some time
and nobody complained.
And they can always set it to such a date in Linux only using date -s 
if they really want.
