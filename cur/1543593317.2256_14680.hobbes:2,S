Input API looks nice. For now, I'll write a patch against pc_keyb.c to add a hook for my qoder stuff, and a loadable module for the meat of the driver. Then I'll port up to the input API. The Qoder is strictly ps/2 keyboard, as far as its interface goes, so I cannot use the input API for now. I have a Sparc here; does it have drivers you wish to have ported?
