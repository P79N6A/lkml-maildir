I instrumented my kernel to printk in aux_write_dev, and it seems 
to be only called when the x server is started or when you switch
into the x server console. Console switch is very expensive latency
wise anyways, so maybe it is not a too big problem (``don't do that'') 
I still would prefer to use better locking because such a long spinlock
is just bad style.
