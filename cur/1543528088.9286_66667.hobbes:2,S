Just a heads up -- this problem, as reported by myself and several
other during February for kernels 2.3.45 and up (and possibly 2.3.44)
persists up through 2.3.48.  So far, all of the people who have
reported problems have reported the exact same symptoms (well, I'd
never tried to access the serial device after trying to unload the
module, but doing so just now  gave me an instant reboot, no oops
message).
I've been unable to find anyone listed in MAINTAINERS who would seem
to be responsible for the generic serial driver; if there is such a
person, could someone point me in the right direction?
More information on how exactly to reproduce the problem is available
in a variety of mail messages, and is of course also available on
request from me.  I'm also happy to try anything that would help in
debugging the problem, if people tell me what to do.
