Hi,
> Sender, InterScan has detected virus(es) in your e-mail attachment.
What about adding an SPF entry to the vger.kernel.org DNS?
vger IN TXT "v=spf1 mx ~all"
or something. This is a hint for SPF parsers (like the upcoming
SpamAssassin) that mails from vger.kernel.org that are not sent via the
MX server might be forged.
