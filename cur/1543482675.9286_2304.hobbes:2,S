The extra caching _can_ take a lot more room, but in low memory the
kernel will trim them back: the minimum extra memory overhead is not
that great.  However, you still have to put up with all of the extra
kernel code required to support them.

2.2.0 release _should_ be fine.  Let me know if you have major
performance problems relative to 2.0.36.
