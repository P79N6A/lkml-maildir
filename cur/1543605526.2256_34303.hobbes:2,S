Hmm. It used to work with 2.2-kernel. With too large image, it just gave an
error.

Yep.

Ok. I updated to 1.10 from redhat rawhide, but as said it didn't work at all
with 2.2 ("failed to mmap /dev/null" or something) so I went back to 1.9. I
could retry now that I've updated the machine in question to 2.4. (I can
also see if the 2.2 /dev/null error reproduces if you are interested.) I'll
retry too large image with 1.10 and report back to you, but I fear it is a
kernel bug.

;)

I see.
