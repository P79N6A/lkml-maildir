Ok, so as Andrew is in Cc:, I suppose he will pick the patch :-)

After this patch, they are still used by the lib/inflate.c code. But if
you look at the patch called "inflate: refactor inflate malloc code"
that I sent to the LKML this morning, you'll see that it removes the
malloc() and free() wrappers (and does some more clean-up).
Sincerly,
Thomas
