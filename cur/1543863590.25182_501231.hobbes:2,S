I applied it yesterday and today my dmesg contains three:
BUG: at mm/truncate.c:60 cancel_dirty_page()
Call Trace:
 [<ffffffff8029f3e5>] cancel_dirty_page+0x43/0x71

 [<ffffffff8025725e>] system_call+0x7e/0x83
Which never happened before... I dunno if they are related though, but
they weren't there before...
(It does fix the timeout problem)
