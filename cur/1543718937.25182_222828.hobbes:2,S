Subject: [PATCH] Put irq stacks in .bss.page_aligned section
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I noticed that my vmlinux BSS had grown from 17k to 45k between 2.6.5
and 2.6.6. 8k was moving a pair of objects in head.S from the text
section to bss, 8k was the introduction of IRQ stacks, while the
remainder (12k) was page alignment slop, some of it spurious. The
following patch brings BSS down to the expected 33k.
Throw the IRQ stacks into the page aligned section to avoided wasted
BSS space. While we'd expect this to save up to 4k, this saves over
10k of BSS here due to gcc3.3 spuriously aligning other objects in the
vicinity.
