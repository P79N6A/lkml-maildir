Well it switches between page and swap cache, but it seems to just
use the normal pagecache / swapcache functions for that. It could be
that I've got a big hole somewhere, but so far I don't think you've
pointed oen out.

Well what's the trouble with it?

I know what a memory barrier is and does, so you said the
necessary memory barriers aren't in place, so can you deal
with it?

I don't think there is anything wrong with it. I would be very
keen to see real adversary arguments elsewhere though.

Well yeah thanks, you did point out a thinko I made, and that was very
helpful and I value any time you spend looking at it. But just saying
"this is wrong, that won't work, that's crap, ergo the concept is
useless" without finding anything specifically wrong is not very
constructive.
