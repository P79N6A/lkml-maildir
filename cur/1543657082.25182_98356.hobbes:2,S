What is the preferred way of translating 'above' declarations
in modules.conf to modprobe.conf? I have several cases where
I use these declarations, but the most import one for me is
'above scsi_mod ide-scsi'.
Secondly, how is one supposed to look up symbols in modules
now that /proc/ksyms is gone? I'm trying to debug an oops
where the kernel dereferences a pointer into an unloaded module.
