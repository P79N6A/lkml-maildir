All,
I get the following compile-time error when linking in linux/malloc.h:
In file included from /usr/include/asm/semaphore.h:11,
                 from /usr/include/linux/fs.h:161,
                 from /usr/include/linux/capability.h:13,
                 from /usr/include/linux/binfmts.h:5,
                 from /usr/include/linux/sched.h:8,
                 from /usr/include/linux/mm.h:4,
                 from /usr/include/linux/slab.h:14,
                 from /usr/include/linux/malloc.h:4,
                 from sci.c:23:
/usr/include/asm/current.h:4: global register variable follows a function definition
/usr/include/asm/current.h:4: warning: call-clobbered register used for global register variable
Anyone else seen this?
Thanks,
