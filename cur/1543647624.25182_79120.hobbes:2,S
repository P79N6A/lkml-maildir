   drivers/serial/Config.in defines the following:
   if [ "$CONFIG_SPARC32" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_SPARC64" = "y" ]; then
   	define_bool CONFIG_SERIAL_SUNCORE y
   	define_bool CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE y
   There are no deps for CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE in
   drivers/serial/Makefile
Yeah that's weird.  Just enable one of the sun serial
drivers for now and it will fix itself.
Probably a fix could be to add CONFIG_SERIAL_SUNCORE to the
checks that set CONFIG_SERIAL_CORE, I think that's how I'll
fix this.
