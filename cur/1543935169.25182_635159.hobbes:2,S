Hi,
Using one of the application to write on the device through scsi, I get the following
Message "Deprecated SCSI ioctl, please convert it to SG_IO". This message is from
System log file. It seems to be kernel message.
Does any kernel settings is required to overcome this warning message ?
I searched in mailing list, but I couldn't get succeed, may be I was not
using the right keyword.
Can some help me in solving this issue.
Regards,
Prathiba
