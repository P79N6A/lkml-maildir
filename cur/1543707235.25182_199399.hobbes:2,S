Which part of my argumen don't you understand?
The kernel proper thinks it's just a stream of bytes, and all the existing 
interfaces do likewise.
But we'd have a kernel helper module to let samba do what it already does 
now, except help it do so more efficiently?
The fact that _I_ think pathnames are just a nice stream of bytes sadly 
doesn't make Windows clients do the same. Some day when I'm King Of The 
World, and I can outlaw windows clients, we'll finally get rid of the 
braindamage, but until then I'm pragmatic enough to say "let's help out 
the poor samba people who have to deal with the crap day in and day out".
What's your problem with that?
