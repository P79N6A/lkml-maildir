It saved and restored R12-R15, even though these registers have no
meaning (and are architecturally undefined) when coming from/going to
32-bit mode. Problems? No, except that without the extra loads (stores
don't matter that much I believe) performance is better...

Then ignore this, perhaps with the exception of the unwind info
adjustment.
