Well, currently the Lindent script specifies a line length of 80 characters. 
Should this be changed?
indent -kr -i8 -ts8 -sob -l80 -ss -bs -psl "$@"
                         ^^^^
The CodingStyle document doesn't seem to specifically mention line length, 
but does imply in a couple of places that code should fit nicely on a 
80-column, 24/25-line terminal.
