IMNSHO yes.  You should call request_region, and check its return value
for NULL (region request failed).  request_region is atomic so you much
less worries about region conflicts.
A lot of drivers use check-region and wind up getting things wrong (or
make assumptions based on _very_ old semantics)

Correct.

Good question.  Read through the PCI code, I don't remember.  The remove
function is definitely called once for each device removed...
HOWEVER if you are making assumptions based on the order of remove I
think that is a very bad idea overall.  Since the new PCI interface
makes hotplug seamless, ideally your driver should not care if the
second of three devices is removed before any of the others...
hint:  keep device-specific data stored in pdev->driver_data to assist
your code with being independent of global device lists, and
probe/remove ordering assumptions.

use pdev->driver_data _instead of_ a linked list of devices.

If you must have the device list, be more careful as you describe here. 
Otherwise your code will be unstable in the face of hotplug and other
dynamic events (like suspend/resume).
