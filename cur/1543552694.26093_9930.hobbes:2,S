Hi,
This bug was triggered by trying ctrl-alt-del for reboot in
test10-pre5. It appears to show schedule() getting stuck in
a loop with the stack growing unbounded.
Unfortunately, the module list and symbols are not exposed.
I don't know what had been unloaded before the bug
triggered. The initial module list shouldnt be too different
from the current:
ppp_deflate            40064   0 (autoclean)
bsd_comp                4320   0 (autoclean)
ppp_async               6480   1 (autoclean)
nfsd                   68624   0 (autoclean)
lockd                  50704   0 (autoclean) [nfsd]
sunrpc                 59072   0 (autoclean) [nfsd lockd]
ppp_generic            13024   3 (autoclean) [ppp_deflate
bsd_comp ppp_async]
slhc                    4688   1 (autoclean) [ppp_generic]
parport_pc             18864   1 (autoclean)
plip                   11152   1 (autoclean)
parport                26240   1 (autoclean) [parport_pc
plip]
tulip                  33904   2 (autoclean)
Unzipped, the trace is over 420k. The stack trace is
periodic enough that, bzipped, it is marginnaly short enough
for l-k.
Serial console is a very good thing :)
