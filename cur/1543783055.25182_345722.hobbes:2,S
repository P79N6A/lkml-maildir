Subject: [PATCH 1/1] block: CFQ refcounting fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I ran across a memory leak related to the cfq scheduler. The cfq
init function increments the refcnt of the associated request_queue.
This refcount gets decremented in cfq's exit function. Since blk_cleanup_queue
only calls the elevator exit function when its refcnt goes to zero, the
request_q never gets cleaned up. It didn't look like other io schedulers were
incrementing this refcnt, so I removed the refcnt increment and it fixed the
memory leak for me.
To reproduce the problem, simply use cfq and use the scsi_host scan sysfs
attribute to scan "- - -" repeatedly on a scsi host and watch the memory
vanish.
