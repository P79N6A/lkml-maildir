As posted on 2004-06-07 ACPI support seems to be broken for Intel
D865PERL board since at least 2.6.7-rc2.
When booting with the standard flags (nmi_watchdog=1 root=/dev/md0
video=matroxfb:vesa:0x1bb) the kernel locks up with different error
messages immediately after "ACPI: Subsystem revision 20040326". Adding
"acpi=off" to the command line makes everything work again.
You can find my dmesg output (with "acpi=off") and my .config here:
