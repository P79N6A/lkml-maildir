I just compiled 2.2.14pre16 and then manually loaded knfs:
# rpc.mountd
# rpc.knfsd            
Except that I meant to run more than one, so I killed the sole nfsd and
got this:  (snagged from messages)
Installing knfsd (copyright (C) 1996 okir@monad.swb.de).

Looks like only the last trace address was decodable by klogd??
Anyway, mountd died at the same time, so I restarted it.
But then rpc.knfsd 8  kept dying with "address already in use" although
no nfsd's were showing with ps.
After reboot, and retrying without forgetting the '8' all seems OK.
If anyone needs, I can attempt to repeat this.
grep -i nfs /usr/src/linux/.config
CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
CONFIG_NFSD=m
# CONFIG_NFSD_SUN is not set
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux (egcs-1.1.2 release)
rpc.mountd/rpc.nfsd as distributed with RH 6.0.
More details on request.
