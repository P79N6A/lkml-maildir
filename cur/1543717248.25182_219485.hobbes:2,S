eh? magic groups are nasty...  and why is this needed?  can't
oracle/whatever just run with a wrapper to give the capabilities out
as required until a better solution is available
merging this as-is IMO is a mistake, how about we get a chance to chew
on this for a while --- superficially it feels like a really nasty
hack
and who cares if vendors show something worse?  vendors ship crap all
the time, that's partly why we have vendor kernels --- to ship crap
that people want now w/o having to corrupt and pollute the cleanliness
of the mainline kernel until a sufficiently well thought out sane plan
can be devised
