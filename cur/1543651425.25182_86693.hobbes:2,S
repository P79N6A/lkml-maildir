This sounds like the right way to go.  I do hope the configuration
file includes an SHA checksum of the secutable.  And to avoid race
conditions, there really ought to be a new system call, fexecve(2)
which takes an open file descriptor instead of a pathname.
(Unfortunately, we're in feature freeze now, so that will have to wait
until 2.7.)
Failing that, though, /usr/bin/super should really check the
permissions starting from the root of the entire pathaname, and fail
the exec if any of the containing directories are writable by a
non-root user.  (And of course, the executable should not be writable
by a non-root users for the same reason.)
With these checks, though, adding support for capabilities in
/usr/bin/super sounds like the right approach.  It doesn't require any
kernel changes (well, fexecve(2) would be nice, but it's not strictly
required).  There is of course a slight performance penalty associated
with the use of the helper program, but the start time of most setuid
root programs probably isn't a performance critical concern.
