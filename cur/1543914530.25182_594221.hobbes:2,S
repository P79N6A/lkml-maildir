Now I'm more confused.  I have two separeate questions:
a) Is the justr-added update-n_high_memory-node-state-for-memory-hotadd-fix.patch
   still needed?
b) Which patch in 2.6.22-rc4-mm1 does
   update-n_high_memory-node-state-for-memory-hotadd.patch fix?  In other
   words, into which patch should I fold
   update-n_high_memory-node-state-for-memory-hotadd.patch prior to sending
   to Linus?
   (I (usually) get to work this out for myself.  Sometimes it is painful).
Generally, if people tell me which patch-in-mm their patch is fixing,
it really helps.  Adrian does this all the time.
Thanks.
