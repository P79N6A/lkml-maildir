Apparently Andrews patch tools allow trailing comments on active lines
in the series file, as in these lines culled from the series file for
2.6.13-rc6-mm2:
    e1000-numa-aware-allocation-of-descriptors-v2.patch # hold
    nfs-nfs3-page-null-fill-in-a-short-read-situation.patch # wait
    sched-implement-nice-support-across-physical-cpus-on-smp.patch # con
    sched-change_prio_bias_only_if_queued.patch # con
    sched-account_rt_tasks_in_prio_bias.patch # con
    sched-smp-nice-bias-busy-queues-on-idle-rebalance.patch # con
    sched-correct_smp_nice_bias.patch # con
    md-fix-rh_dec-rh_inc-race-in-dm-raid1c.patch # wait
However the quilt command passes these additional terms to the patch
command as additional arguments, confusing the heck out of patch,
and generating an error message that confused the heck out of me.
Question - should I be asking Andrew not to comment this way, or
should I be asking quilt to recognize a comment convention here?
If we choose the second alternative, then the following change to
the file /usr/local/share/quilt/scripts/patchfns might to the trick:
--- /tmp/q/patchfns.1	2005-08-29 19:11:24.000000000 -0700
+++ /tmp/q/patchfns.2	2005-08-29 19:11:31.000000000 -0700
