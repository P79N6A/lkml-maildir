MAP_PRIVATE also - even if you earlier wrote private data there before
the file got truncated down.

Since you're not guaranteeing it, shall I?
The Open Posix Testsuite tests for it: though I haven't run that up,
and its conformance/interfaces/mmap/coverage.txt notes it failed with
glibc-2.3 on Linux-2.6.0-test2.
I have just tested mmap SIGBUS beyond EOF on 2.6.13-rc7,
i386 and x86_64, works correctly as expected.
A quick browse through the others shows all the MMU architectures
appearing to support it: delivering SIGBUS signal if VM_FAULT_SIGBUS
returned by handle_mm_fault.
Except for PA-RISC, which delivers SIGSEGV instead.  I imagine that's
wrong, but safer to leave unchanged now - I won't guarantee that one.

It would be easier to follow the route from ->nopage observing offset
beyond EOF through to delivery of the SIGBUS if filemap_nopage were
to say NOPAGE_SIGBUS, rather than the NULL that's defined to be.
