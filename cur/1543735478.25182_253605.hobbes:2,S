Do not forget that you have to implement also return to CPL1, as
NMI may arrive while you are running on CPL1.  So it may not be
as trivial as it seemed.  Maybe all these programs survive that
their CPL3 stack changes, and then you could just push cs,eip and
esp on CPL3 stack, and return to user code (vsyscall page seems 
natural place for that code) which would do pop %esp; retf?
Only problem is how to find that old SS points to 16bit segment.
You need LAR and/or you have to peek GDT/LDT to find stack size, 
and AFAIK LAR is microcoded on P4.
