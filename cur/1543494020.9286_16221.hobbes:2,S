Subject: Bug with fcntl locks, pthread mutexes, and threads?

I think I'm running into a very complicated threading bug.
To reproduce it, I use the attached C program. The program forks off
two child processes, each with two threads. Each thread tries to grab
a two-layer lock, with a pthread lock followed by an fcntl lock. The
thread then sleeps for a long time. So, once we have a thread that has
gotten through both locks, we have:
process 1:
    thread 1: holds pthread lock, holds fcntl lock, sleeping
    thread 2: waiting on pthread lock
process 2:
    thread 1: holds pthread lock, waiting on fcntl lock
    thread 2: waiting on pthread lock
Then I kill -TERM process 1. All of its threads go away, but process
2, thread 1 never wakes up out of fcntl(). lsof claims that none of
the remaining processes/threads hold the lock.
This sounds like a bug.
