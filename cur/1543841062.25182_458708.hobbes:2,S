	Hmm, yeah, this is a bug.  I've added
http://oss.oracle.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=755.
  Thanks for
reporting this!

	I did get this straight from sysfs.  You are right, there is
less sharing of such things in configfs compared to sysfs.  Here's the
thing: this scheme allows the generic code (the ->show() and ->store()
methods) to take struct configfs_attribute, but the actual worker
functions take context appropriate objects, such a struct o2nm_node in
the example you placed.  Without this indirection, every ->show() would
have to do its own conversion from configfs_attribute to the context
appropriate structures.

	Yeah, I'm sorry I haven't gotten to it yet.

	Also note that you can fail the callback in your driver,
preventing the rename(2) -- eg, if a particular option needs to be set
but isn't, etc.

	The plan is (c).  Build a new one in pending, and rename(2) it
on top of the current one.

	Linux doesn't support directory hardlinks, for good reason.
