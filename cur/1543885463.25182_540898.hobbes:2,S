Sorry for late response. I went on a vacation in last week.
And I'm in the mountain of a ton of unread mail now....

Hmm, I don't think my review is enough.
To be precise, I'm just one user/tester of ZONE_MOVABLE.
I have tried to make memory remove patches with Mel-san's
ZONE_MOVABLE patch. And the bugs are things that I found in its work.
(I'll post these patches in a few days.)

From memory-hotplug view, ZONE_MOVABLE should be aligned by section
size. But MAX_ORDER alignment is enough for others...
Bye.
