Yes, and that's worth doing anyway, IMO.

Well, I've been playing a bit with that for some time, but it's not easy by any
means.
In short, I'm seeing some problems related to the handling of ACPI that seem to
shatter the entire idea of having separate hibernate methods, at least as far
as ACPI systems are concerned.
