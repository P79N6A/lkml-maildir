mmm.  I don't know whether it's really a tty level issue or a serial
issue.  The only tty classes with corresponding devices are the serial
ones, at least on my system.  If this is the case, then the right fix
would seem to be something like creating a new struct device for each
serial port, then making that the uart_port->dev instead of the pci_dev
or whatever.
