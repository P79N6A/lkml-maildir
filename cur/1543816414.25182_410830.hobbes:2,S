hello there,
I purchased a promise TX2Plus SATA controller.
Works fine so far, but I also bought a SATA DVD writer.
The TX2Plus supports SATA ATAPI, and recognizes my burner correctly.
But in the boot messages it says:
ata2(0): WARNING: ATAPI is not supported with this driver, device ignored.
Is there a way to use the burner with this controller?
If not, are there plans to enable ATAPI for the sata_promise driver?
Thanks in advance,
	Hinrich
