I concur with Daniel. If we can decide how to deal with that (toss
one out, keep one, merge them, whatever), we could reuse all the user
space glue that is the hardest part to get right.
Current tip of development has some issues with conditional variables
and broadcasts (requeue stuff) that I need to sink my teeth in. Joe
Korty is fixing up a lot of corner cases I wasn't catching, but 
other than that is doing fine.
How long ago since you saw it? I also implemented the futex redirection
stuff we discussed some months ago.
