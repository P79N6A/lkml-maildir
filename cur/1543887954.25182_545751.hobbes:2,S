Ignoring bugs and signed return values for error handling, it is either
64bit or 32+32bit.
Inode numbers and file positions are 64bit.  Offsets are 64bit as well.
In a couple of places, offsets are also 32+32bit.  Basically the high
bits contain the segment number, the lower bits the offset within a
segment.
Side note: It would be nicer if the high 32bit were segment number.
Instead the number of bits depends on segment size.  Guess I should
change that while the format isn't fixed yet.
An "area" is a segment that is currently being written.  Data is
appended to this segment as it comes in, until the segment is full.  Any
functions dealing with areas only need a 32bit offset, which is the
offset within the area, not the absolute device offset.
Writes within an area are also buffered.  New data first goes into the
write buffer (wbuf) and only when this is full is it flushed to the
device.  NAND flash and some NOR flashes require such buffering.  When
writing to the device, the 32bit segno and the 32bit in-segment offset
need to get converted back to a 64bit device offset.

Yes, as described above.

The filesystem format is 64bit.  The current code can only deal with
63bit.  Eric Sandeen just fixed ext2 to actually deal with 32bit
numbers and the same is possible for logfs.  If anyone ever cares...

That indeed is a bug.  __logfs_get_free_bytes() should return s64
instead of s32.  Will fix immediatly.
If anyone can find similar bugs, the bounty is a beer or non-alcoholic
beverage of choice. :)
