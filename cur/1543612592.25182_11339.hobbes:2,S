My patch simply fixed a few things like holding spinlocks across
sleeping functions, forgetting to release locks when returning
from functions, etc.
Yes, others have suggested that the whole lot should be reverted,
for several reasons.  However it looks like that won't happen, so we
need to debug the present code.  But it works for me.
I can review the code, see if anything stands out.  But it'll probably
require someone who can reproduce it to be able to fix it.
