While a difference between 2.4.20-pre4 and -pre5 may be a clue,
it isn't the root cause, because they're both broken.
Looks like only 2.4.18-27.7.xsmp (whatever that is) got 0 failures.
Any chance you can run a test with, say, 2.6.5?
It might also be interesting to know what compiler built each kernel..
cheers,
