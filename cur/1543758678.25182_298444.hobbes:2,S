Yes.  e.g., on embedded systems you may not use the display hardware
(and would therefore like to save a bit of memory) but it's convenient
to have only one build of the kernel/modules.

Not the (new) Geode framebuffer driver -- it uses regular module
parameters for this very reason.

It's useful for testing if nothing else.  True, the Geode framebuffer
driver won't restore the mode on unload but since the software VGA
emulation on a Geode is less than perfect[*] I would expect people to
not use vgacon and thus there's nothing really to restore.
