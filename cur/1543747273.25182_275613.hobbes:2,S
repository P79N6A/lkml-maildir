It's a pain, which is why people want to do something about it.

And allows abuse and doesn't penalise laziness; both of which do happen in the
kernel header files.

We use C & ASM for the kernel because you and others won't allow anything
else. Not that I'm necessarily endorsing the use of other languages - I like C
and ASM; I just look at stuff in the kernel occasionally and know that other
languages handle it better and more efficiently. That is, however, besides the
point.

It can get in the way accidentally.

If you did user annotations you'd have to solve the problem of applying it to
#defines and still allowing the constants to be used in assembly. Obviously
this is not impossible. This is trivial with __KERNEL__ or separation into
other files.
