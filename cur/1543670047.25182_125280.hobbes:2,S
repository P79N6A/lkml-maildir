Hi,
Whenever the path on which an I/O is in-progress, 
goes down, sd takes a long time to detect it. As per 
my knowledge it would be 60sec * 5(no. of retries) 
plus the time taken by the lower layer driver(hba) 
to detect the failure. Is this correct ?? Is there a 
way available to reduce this "timeout/retry count" 
value without modifying sd.c
