Samuli,
This is a bad skew in the timing between the drive, cable, host.
I forgot the hardware you have but if it has a hwif->speedproc then we are
in good shape for it to auto down-grade the transfer to a stable point
were the iCRC errors stop.

What do you mean that it will not run for a long period of time?
DeadLock?
