Only what I've posted as part of the patch. I cannot benchmark the
scalability on large numbers of processors as I lack such a machine. I am
*guessing* that the inability of previous patch versions to use per-cpu
caches for kernel allocations would have hurt, but I do not know for a
fact.

It's still being maintained, I didn't post it because I didn't think
people were interested and I am happy to keep the stats patch as part of
VMRegress. The current version of the statistics patch is attached this
mail. It comes with a noticeable performance penalty when enabled.

Right now, the KernRclm areas tend to free up in large blocks over time,
but there is no way of forcing it so we rarely get the MAX_ORDER-1 sized
blocks from the kernel areas. The per-cpu caches pollute areas very slowly
but are not very noticable in the kernrclm areas. As I don't expect to get
the interesting large blocks fre ein the kernel areas, and this is a
critical path, I decided to let the per-cpu lists share the kernel lists.
When hotplug comes into play, or we have a mechanism for force-reclaiming
the KernRclm areas, this will need to be revisited.
Does this make sense?

We could, and in an unreleased version, it was a #define. I used the 0 and
1 to look similar to how hot/cold page lists are managed and I wanted
things to look familiar.

I'll release a verion on Monday against the latest rc5 kernel with a
#define instead. Probably something like PCPU_KERNEL and PCPU_USER
