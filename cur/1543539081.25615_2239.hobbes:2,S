With me NVidia driver 0.94 works fine. I have 2.4.0-test4, Geforce 256 and
XFree86 4.0.1
NVidia driver 0.94:
ftp://ftp1.detonator.nvidia.com/pub/drivers/english/XFree86_40/0.9-4/
NVIDIA_GLX-0.9-4.xfree401.tar.gz and NVIDIA_kernel-0.9-4.src.rpm
> Anyone have any thoughts?   Just wait on a new driver from NVidia?
NVidia driver 0.93 with XFree86 4.0.1 didn't work with me...
