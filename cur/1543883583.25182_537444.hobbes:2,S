... snip ...
at this point, maybe i'll just leave this in the hands of those who
know far more about it than i do.  but, while we're here, are there
any *other* combinations that wouldn't make any sense?  might as well
check for those in my cleanup script as well.

p.s.  as a suggestion that borders on overkill, one could always add a
configuration debugging option that, when set, compiles code into
kmalloc() that does a sanity check on its type flag arguments.
