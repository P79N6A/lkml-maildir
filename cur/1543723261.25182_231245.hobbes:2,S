ok. well, i'm currently running the 2.6.7-bk10, and it runs really
nicely for one thing, and the other is that the pty behaviour is exactly
like the old one (which i've just been told 'first fit' *is* the old
behaviour). 
in a way i like the newer behaviour, but hmm, maybe have both
behaviours? first fit for some old/buggy apps, and the new one for ones
that correctly detect the new capabilities. though IME most of the
applications i've used don't recognise the new one, and having varying
levels of freakiness - from a warning to outright not working as
expected (e.g., my problem with screen, the "Value too large" message).
thanks :)
