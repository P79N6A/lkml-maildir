  Hi, all. Version 118 of my devfs patch is now available from:

The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.3.15-pre3. Highlights of this release:
- Ported to kernel 2.3.15-pre3
- Fixed bug in loop driver
- Unregister /dev/lp%d entries in drivers/char/lp.c
  Thanks to Maciej W. Rozycki <macro@ds2.pg.gda.pl>
