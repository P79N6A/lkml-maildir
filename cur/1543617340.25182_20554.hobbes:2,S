Thanks for confirming a bug, so I understand that mounting an initrd
loses the rootfsflags, and as the actual root= parameter is kept over an
initrd boot, it should also be possible for rootfsflags= -- can the
rootfsflags maybe be saved along with the root= parameter?

Hum, yes, but that's not the point, someone turned up with a SuSE 7.3
default kernel .config, and it had ...MSDOS=y ...REISERFS=m -- that says
about all, msdos is higher in the list, reiserfs is then loaded from
initrd, and thus at the bottom of the list. Strange enough SuSE compile
MSDOS which hardly anyone needs at boot time into the kernel, but not
reiserfs (admittedly, reiserfs takes up some memory, but then, it's a
native file system and should be loaded before non-native file systems
such as msdos, vfat, ntfs, freevxfs or whatever). This one is for the
distributors to fix.
Had they left MSDOS as a module, things would have worked out: 1. ext2
in the kernel 2. initrd loads reiserfs 3. actual root (reiserfs) is
mounted 4. only now, msdos.o becomes available.
