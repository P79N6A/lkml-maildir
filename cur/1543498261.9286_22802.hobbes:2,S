NFS only caches as much as the normal file caching goes.  It never uses
a local disk to keep remote data close at hand.  Last time I asked about
CacheFS I was told that it wouldn't be too hard to have NFS data be swapped 
out to swap rather than merely discarded.  This would indeed provide one
part of what CacheFS provides.
But for me, the most interesting aspect of CacheFS is disconnected operation
(rather than performance): NFS share /usr or /opt while still allowing the
clients to work (and even reboot) if the server is down (as long as they only
access files that they already accesses recently enough).
I've also been forwarded to coda which does provide such features and even more
(along with on-disk caching of data).
