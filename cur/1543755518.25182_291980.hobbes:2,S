That would be the case if the entire array was unaligned, or (size %
sizeof(long)) != 0. If people sort arrays that are unaligned even though
the element size is a multiple of sizeof(long) (or sizeof(u32) as Matt
proposes), they are just begging for bad performance. Otherwise, we're
doing byte-wise swap anyway.
