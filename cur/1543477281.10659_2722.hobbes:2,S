Because it worked by forcing the Perl script to dump core, then using undump 
to convert the result to an executable.  Nonportable (undump is impossible 
on some architectures), forces formerly shared data and sometimes shared 
code to be non-shared, and can do strange and/or ugly things (or not work at 
all) if shared libraries are involved.  (Which they often are in Perl5 --- 
hasn't I/O been moved to a .xs module?)

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
