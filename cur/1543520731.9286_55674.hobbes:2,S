Nope.
See Alan's mail, same thread as well as a few others. Solar's patches also
realign where your libs are mapped. As a result the offset you are referring to
always contains a 0x00. So no exploit. Bad luck...
I maybe mistaken, but the only currently well known buffer overrun cases that do
not fall here and where you can pass a null inside the code and do the "return
from libc trick" are some sendmail and imap exploits where the exploit code is
decoded from a quoted or encoded fragment (mime decode/encode overruns and
friends). And these are very version/compiler speicific and are actually a very
high bar for the average kiddiez
