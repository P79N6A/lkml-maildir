Subject: [PATCH 1/3] add a private data field within kobj_attribute structure (final#2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[PATCH 1/3] add a private data field within kobj_attribute structure.
This patch add a private data field, declared as void *, within kobj_attribute
structure. The _show() and _store() method in the sysfs attribute entries can
refer this information to identify what entry is accessed.
It makes easier to share a single method implementation with several similar
entries, like ones to export the list of capabilities the running kernel
supports.

 with the kobject_create_and_add(), can be of type kobj_attribute, so no
 special custom attribute is needed to be created.
+The simple kobj_attribute is prototyped at include/linux/kobject.h, and can
+contain your own show()/store() method and private data.
+When an attribute is accessed, these methods are invoked with kobject,
+kobj_attribute and read/write buffer. The method can refer the private data
+via given kobj_attribute, to show/store itself in the text representation.

 See the example module, samples/kobject/kobject-example.c for an
 implementation of a simple kobject and attributes.
