Ok, done. Since they weren't the last commits in your branch, I had to do 
a certain amount of hand-waving: I merged up to the commit preceding the 
AC flag changes, and then I cherry-picked the one later commit separately.
So it's not a normal merge, since I wanted to avoid those two commits.
I've pushed out the result, you should check it out (and drop the top 
three commits on your head once you're ok with my result, since they won't 
exist in my tree).
