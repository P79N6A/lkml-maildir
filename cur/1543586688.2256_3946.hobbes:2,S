I assume your questions are directed at the difference between local
and global scheduling decisions.  As with most things the impact of
these differences depends on workload.  Most multi-queue scheduler
implementations make local scheduling decisions and depend on load
balancing for system wide fairness.  Schedulers which make global
decisions handle load balancing via their global policy.
The HP multi-queue implementation you are using performs no load
balancing.  Therefore, in a worst case situation you could have
low priority tasks sharing one CPU while high priority tasks are
sharing another.  To be fair, I have talked to the HP people and
this scheduler was never intended to be a general purpose solution.
Therefore, it makes little sense to comment its merits as such.

My primary motivation for attempting to perform the same global
decisions as the current scheduler was so that meaningful comparisons
could be made.  Also, by using the same global decision policy I
was able to avoid the issue of load balancing.  In most multi-queue
implementations, load balancing algorithms take considerable effort
to get working in a reasonable well performing manner.

There is a 2.4.2 patch on the web page.  I'll put out a 2.4.3 patch
as soon as I get some time.
