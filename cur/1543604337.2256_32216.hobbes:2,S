I'm pretty sure this is because dump reads the block device directly
(which is cached in the buffer cache), while the file data for cached
files lives in the page cache, and the two caches are no longer
coherent (as of 2.4).
If you can find it, Linus has ranted on this list at least once about
why you should never use 'dump'...
If you're doing backups under 2.4, use tar or cpio.
