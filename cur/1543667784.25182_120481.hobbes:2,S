Stands for Time Stamp Counter.  It is a special cpu register that 
basically counts cpu cycles.  Some times (incorrectly me thinks) it is 
affected by power management code which slows the cpu by changing the 
cpu frequency.

I agree, however, what is really needed is not available in x86 
machines, i.e. a cpu register that has a fixed and stable count rate. 
  An I/O register is second best because of the long time it takes to 
read it.
