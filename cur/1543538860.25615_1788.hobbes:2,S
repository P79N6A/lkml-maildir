Linus,
I'm posting MANOS today -- there's an NT flavor DLL loader in the
sources if you want to look at it that's more like Microsoft's than the
one in Linux.  NT uses something called a forwarder chain in the DLL
loader to handle this problem for dynanmically linked modules, though I
agree that the way they do it is an absolute hack.  They allow the
loader to detect changed APIs and insert a "forwarder" function when the
external reference is resolved by the DLL loader -- this function
evenually calls the real function in kernel but if it's added a
parameter or something, it lets you slip in a forwarder function to
fixup the stack and munge the parms if someone altered an interface. 
Something like this would allow us to go modular, and give you the
flexibility you want, but I agree it's still going to be a f_cking
nightmare to get this thing coordinated properly.  You may want to
consider diverging after 2.4 and create a "modular" linux tree and see
how many of us bite on it (I certainly would).  
:-)
Jeff
