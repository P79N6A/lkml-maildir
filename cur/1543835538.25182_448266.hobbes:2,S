Hallo everyone
Today one of my SCSI drives decided to shutdown for no obvious reason.
I suspect heat or a bad power supply. Syslog shows a repeating stream
of the following:
Jul 30 15:51:30 tony kernel: sd 0:0:0:0: Device not ready: <6>: Current: sense key=0x2
Jul 30 15:51:30 tony kernel: ASC=0x4 ASCQ=0x2
Jul 30 15:51:30 tony kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 617358
Google revealed[1] that the drive is waiting for a START UNIT command,
but it seems that the kernel is not attempting to spin up the drive
again. 
After a complete power-cycle the drive worked again. I just wanted to
know if this is a shortcoming in the SCSI error handling codepath.
Regards,
Patrick
