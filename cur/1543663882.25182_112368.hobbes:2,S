Which is indeed my point. If you cannot distinguish it from incorrect
uses, you shouldn't be warnign the user, because the compiler obviously
doesn't know enough to make a sufficiently educated guess.
That said, a good compiler _can_ make a good warning. But to do so, you 
have to actually do value analysis, instead of just blindly warning about 
code that is obviously correct to a human.
Until gcc does sufficient value analysis, that signed warning is annoying,
worthless and a damn pain in the ass.
