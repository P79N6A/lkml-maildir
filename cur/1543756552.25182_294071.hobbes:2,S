Why couldn't we extend the structure ? That would at worse break modules
binary compatibility, who cares ? :)
Those pads are just stuff that aren't used any more, and back then, when
removing them, we did care about modules binary compat...
Anyways, I don't think there's anything to worry about at this point.
