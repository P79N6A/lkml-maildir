Hi Amul,
Can you tell where it is placed in your system? At the end of physical
RAM?

I think both the methods are not the right way to solve the problem. It
will just fix the symtom you are facing. Currently this solution works
for you as you are using MADT tables from ACPI. But it will fail if you try
to boot second kernel on your system with acpi=off as MP tables are not
accessible.
I think the right way to fix this problem would be to let kexec-tools know
where the MP table is in RAM and kexec-tools can create another memmap=
entry for that area so that MP tables are accessible in second kernel.
I think you need to export the MP table location and size to user space,
say through /sys/kernel/. And also modify kexec-tools to parse it.
Thanks
Vivek
