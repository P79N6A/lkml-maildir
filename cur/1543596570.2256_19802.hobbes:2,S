The important thing is that pci_alloc_consistent and the other PCI DMA
functions work as advertised on IA64.  If you pass NULL to
pci_alloc_consistent, IA64 should give you an ISA DMA-able address.  If
you don't, you get a 32-bit PCI DMA address.  Use of GFP_DMA is a
arch-specific detail, so don't let me confuse you there.
