Well I just doubled checked this assertion.  The one driver that uses
the hypertransport irqs doesn't call disable_irq.  On the msi side
at least the forcedeth driver does call disable_irq when in msi mode.
I just doubled checked the historical behavior of the msi code and
it has never done the delayed disable thing.  So not doing it there
is not a regression.
The MSI case is different.  MSI is fundamentally about non-shared
interrupts, and interrupts that don't race with your DMAs.  So with
MSI you don't need a status register read to process the interrupt.
In the context of Ingo's patch I don't like the idea of saddling MSI
interrupts down with the best in class work arounds for a completely
different hardware interrupt model.  Although I don't doubt MSI will
get it's own set of work arounds as we come to know it better.

Sounds like a plan.
