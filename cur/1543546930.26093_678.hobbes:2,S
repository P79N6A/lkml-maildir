No, that's not the right solution.
I think the right solution is to completely split up "schedule()" into two
different functions (which just share 99% of the code), and basically have
the idle thread call the _other_ schedule. The one that never does the
test at all.
That way you know statically whether you are the idle thread or not. No
test at all.
