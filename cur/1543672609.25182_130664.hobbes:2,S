There's at least one patch floating around to do that; we've used it 
to help track down some stack overflow problems.
Does 2.5 use a separate interrupt stack? (Excuse my ignorance; I 
haven't been paying attention.) Total stack-page usage in the 2.4 
model, at any rate, is the sum of the task struct, the usage of any 
task-level thread (system calls, pretty much), any softirq (including 
the network protocol & routing handlers, and any netfilter modules), 
and some number of possibly-nested hard interrupts.
That adds up.
One thing that would help (aside from separate interrupt stacks) 
would be a guard page below the stack. That wouldn't require any 
physical memory to be reserved, and would provide positive indication 
of stack overflow without significant runtime overhead.
