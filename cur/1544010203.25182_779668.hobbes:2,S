It'd be great if you could test something more recent please.

Well this is bad.  We don't want the kernel calling out to userspace
each time you run socket(PF_NETLINK, ...).  The performance could be
awful.
I don't know if this is a net problem, an audit problem or whatever. 
Probably the offending kernel code simply shouldn't exist if
CONFIG_AUDIT=n.
Please attach a copy of the config to
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12201

OK, weird.
Please get sysrq working then get us a task trace, so we can see who is
sleeping where.  Do this:
- run your "small pilot program"
- wait one second (so we catch it while it is delaying)
- echo t > /proc/sysrq-trigger
- dmesg -s 1000000 > foo
- send us a copy of foo.
(foo will be large, so it would be best to attach it to
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12201
 then email us the URL)
(Using `echo w > /proc/sysrq-trigger' would work too, if we know that
the offending processes are stuck in D state.  It will produce less
output)
