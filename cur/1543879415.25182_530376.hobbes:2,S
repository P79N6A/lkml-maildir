I'm OK with allocating subqueues even for single queue devices, not
with leaking memory on error.

Right. And if the queue is enabled again, bands continue to be dequeued
in strict priority order.

No, I'm asking that the users explicitly states that he wants the driver
to control which bands are dequeued (by stopping and starting subqueues)
and not the established strict priority order. You assume everyone using
prio on e1000 wants to use multiple HW queues, which is not necessarily
true. Additionally the prio qdisc might be used as child of a classful
qdisc that assumes it can always dequeue packets as long as q.qlen > 0
(HFSC for example will complain if it can't since that is a
configuration error).
So I'm asking that you only enable this behaviour if the user does
something like this:
tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: prio bands N multiqueue
Ideally the band2queue mapping would be supplied by userspace as well,
but currently that doesn't seem to be possible in a clean way since
userspace has no way of finding out how many queues the HW supports.
