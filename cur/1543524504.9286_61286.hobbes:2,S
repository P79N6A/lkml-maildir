Hi!
This is the third (I don't expect to be final :-)) attempt, the news:
- Avoid some more 64 bit computations. There won't be more
  to remain easily readable.
- One fix in cyrix_get_free_region().
- Compute only once whether "000" has to be appended
  to the string form of base and size in mtrr_add(),
- simple_strtoll() was the copy of simple_strtol(), now calls
  simple_strtoull().
- Most drivers that use mtrr_add()/mtrr_del() (except vesafb) are updated 
  in a simple way.
  Vesafb is corrected to work on non power of two framebuffer sizes.
  I suppose in the implementation that there is a large area that
  can be write-combined and a smaller area at the end that should be
  uncached. The size reported by the VESA BIOS is the size of the large
  area minus the size of the small area. This works on my videocard
  that reports 32704kB. :-)
I am still waiting for AMD K6-II/K6-III/Athlon and Centaur CPU reports.
Regards,
Zoltan Boszormenyi
