That's default with 2.2.14 Makefile... :(
Wellps, even tried O6.... maybe that'll work :)
Did the easy way... "#undef memset" and cut&paste
the memset from lib/string.c
Compiles with one warning about the undef... but works for the rest :)
If someone knows of another solution... then bring it on...
I'll put the new patch for 2.2.14 & 2.3.38 on the following website
later this day...
http://unfix.org/projects/changer/
or:

Greets,
