Hello,
I'd like to report a system freeze happening on USB device plug.
It seems to be related to module uhci-hcd, since when I rmmod it and plug the
device, the system doesn't freeze. After rmmod uhci-hcd and plug, the system is
OK and doesn't freeze when I unplug the device (but freezes if I plug again).
It happens with any kind of USB device : camera, MP3 player, ...
It happens with 2.6 kernels (I didn't test them all, but 2.6.0, 2.6.8, 2.6.11.x,
2.6.12 do).
It DOES NOT happen with 2.4 kernels (with the same hardware configuration and
USB devices).
Magic keys are also dead.
No message in the logs.
My configuration :
PIII 933
Mobo : MSI ms-6309, chipset via vt82c694x/vt82c686a
448 Mb memory
3 IDE disks
PCI creative sound blaster live
AGP Geforce 3
2x Ethernet Pro 100
Debian 3.1r0a
kernel 2.6.12, compiled with gcc 3.3.5, binutils 2.15
udev 0.056
hotplug 0.0.20040329
Please find, as attached file, a description of my system.
I'm sorry if you're not related with maintenance of this part of the kernel. If
not, please tell me who I can report this problem.
Thanks for your help.
Regards,
