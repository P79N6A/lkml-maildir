Subject: [PATCH]: Fix driver bogus delay loop
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

CT based mach64 cards were reported to hang on sparc64 boxes when
compiled with gcc-4.1.x and later.
Looking at this piece of code, it's no surprise.  A critical
delay was implemented as an empty for() loop, and gcc 4.0.x
and previous did not optimize it away, so we did get a delay.
But gcc-4.1.x and later can optimize it away, and we get crashes.
Use a real udelay() to fix this.  Fix verified on SunBlade100.
