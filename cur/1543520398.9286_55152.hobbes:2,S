(Don't worry, personally I have SYN cookies turned on all the time on my
servers.  If for anything, it alerts me to a problem.)

Note that there are two logics here (if you could really think that),
technical validity and political validity.  Technically minded folk
understand the hows and whys of the SYN flood.  Others pop off angry or rude
emails to a variety of supposed origin sites that are "flooding" them.

Here is where the below paragraph came into play, false positives. 
Uninformed people would them complain (sometimes quite rudely) to the
supposed source of the attack.

Statistics are a heavily desired item, i love them.  Knowing how they come
about is also desirable.

I run several servers that do a plethura of things.  I have been attacked a
number of times in the past, probably more than most here.  SYN cookies DO
keep the daemons alive.

If the server is that underpowered, SYN cookies or not, it's going down. 
imho, syn cookies should be on.  Or at least on by default along with a
variety of other things for a "server" policy.  Perhaps it's time to add a
function in the config dependancies to have a template configuration of
default items by selecting the type of machine this kernel is going on?

Without looking at the code again...in the past, it was a staticly chosen
size.  We have to be careful about this because this code is in the fast
path and increasing the table size for the cookies can have a direct impact
on the fast path latency.
