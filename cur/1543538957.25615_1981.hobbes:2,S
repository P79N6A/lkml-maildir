My /usr/src/linux directory has a couple of files in it which can't be deleted, even by root.  The
fs reports some kind of error (It's on my home machine & I can't remember the exact text), and fails
the delete, which means the directory can't be deleted.  I suppose technically the 'directory' isn't
corrupted...  I'm used to seeing this kind of thing on NTFS (where the only way out is a complete reformat
and reinstall).  I'm hoping the forthcoming reiserfsck can delete the files for me and save me having
to reinstall!
