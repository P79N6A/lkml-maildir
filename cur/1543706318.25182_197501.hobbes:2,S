This is probably fixed by the following patch that is sitting in my
queue.
While 2.4 technically needs the same patch, it isn't affected because
it completely ignores the "offset", rather than almost-completely
ignoring it.

off_t in nfsd_commit needs to be loff_t
From: Miquel van Smoorenburg <miquels@cistron.nl>
While I was stress-testing NFS/XFS on 2.6.1/2.6.2-rc, I found that
sometimes my "dd" would exit with:
	#  dd if=/dev/zero bs=4096 > /mnt/file
	dd: writing `standard output': Invalid argument
	1100753+0 records in
	1100752+0 records out
After adding some debug printk's to the server and client code
and some tcpdump-ing, I found that the NFSERR_INVAL was returned by
nfsd_commit on the server.
Turns out that the "offset" argument is off_t instead of loff_t.
It isn't used at all (unfortunately), but it _is_ checked for
sanity, so that's where the error came from.
