I was working with x86_64 ld script and am willing to clean it up a bit.
I can impelment and test DISCARD_UNUSED_SECTIONS for x86_64 and later
for i386.
Other arches can follow when they find it interesting/worthwhile.
At first, big scary warning under "config DISCARD_UNUSED_SECTIONS"
should be enough to make people avoid it for production boxes, I hope.
Should I send next round of patches to you or to Andrew?
