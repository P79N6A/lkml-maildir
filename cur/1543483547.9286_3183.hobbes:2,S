No, that is the whole point behind restricting such allocations to a
zone containing only swappable objects.  There will be no
non-relocatable objects there, and we can simply swap out each page in
the selected contiguous zone.  
_If_ we expect to do this often then we will want to keep the relocated
pages in memory, but for solving the current problem --- driver
initialisation --- that is not so important and we can rely on the
existing page swap code to just get rid of the data which is in the way.
