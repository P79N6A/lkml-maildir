Works fine on the dual-PII.  No "Aieee!!!" messages at all.
After sending a few gigs across the ethernet, running
irq-whacker:
mnm:/usr/src/cptimer> cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      77613      61869    IO-APIC-edge  timer

And without irq-whacker:
mnm:/home/morton> cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0       CPU1
  0:      55384      70899    IO-APIC-edge  timer

  9:          0          0          XT-PIC  acpi
 12:          0          0    IO-APIC-edge  PS/2 Mouse

Tell me, please: what tradeoffs are involved in this patch?
Obviously it works around a pretty fatal problem, but
what are we giving away?
Oh: and thanks :)
