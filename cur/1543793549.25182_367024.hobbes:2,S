The bug is in netpoll. It's non-linear ignorant. We probably can't
call skb_linearize because it wants to kmalloc, but we probably can
follow the fragment. Or, worst case, we can manually linearize into an
SKB in our private pool.
Can we make any assumptions about the size and position of fragments.
For instance, will the first N data bytes of a UDP packet all be in
the same fragment?
