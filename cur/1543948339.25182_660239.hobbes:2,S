Maybe memory fragmentation?  Perhaps the driver tries to allocate a
large block of memory and cannot find a continuous block of the right
size.
Maybe the driver developers used different kernel .config options than
you are using.  
Try increasing the value in /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes.
Try switching some things like SLAB or SLUB, try booting with
kernelcore=512M to enable the Movable memory zone, or try 64-bit vs
32-bit kernels.
