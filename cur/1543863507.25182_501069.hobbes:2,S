Subject: [patch 29/46] ACPI: fix missing include for UP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
apic.h does not get included on UP compiles.  That way the
APICTIMER_STOPS_ON_C3 is not there and UP boxen have no support for
timer broadcasting.  This was never noticed, because the lapic timer is
only used for profiling on UP.
