My understanding is that the kernel and device drivers sometimes
assume physical memory address is not changed.
For example, IA32 kernel often uses __PAGE_OFFSET. 
I suppose that there are many case which the kernel and device drivers
assume physical address is not changed like this.
Even if we use Mr. Iwamoto's method use, some memories will remain.
But, if remaining memories will be on only one (or a few) node,
other nodes will be able to be hot-removed.
I think that dividing attribute hotpluggable or not is realistic way.

Mr. Iwamoto and Mr. Takahashi told me that some memories which is used
by NFS are especially difficult to be hotplugged....
Thanks.
