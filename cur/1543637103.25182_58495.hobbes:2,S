There is the argument "size" to acpi_hw_low_level_read which makes sure that
only the right data is being read. Problem is that a sort of
"segmentation fault" occurs when such a cast allows writing in different
memory than allocated for the value.

The casts were probably introduced for that reason. Per se, they are not
critical - but if there is any assumption later on that the data structure
is indeed of the large size, there is a problem.
