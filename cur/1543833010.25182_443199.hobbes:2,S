I would instead think of this in the context of memory-barrier pairings
as documented in Documentation/memory-barriers.txt.
As Oleg notes above, synchronize_sched() is a "shot in the dark", since
there is nothing that lines up the synchronize_srcu() with any concurrent
srcu_read_lock() or srcu_read_unlock().  The trick here is that the
synchronize_sched() eliminates one of the possibilities (taking this
from the viewpoint of the last synchronize_sched() in synchronize_srcu()
on CPU 0 interacting with a concurrent srcu_read_unlock() on CPU 1):
1.	srcu_read_unlock()'s counter decrement is perceived by CPU 1
	as happening after all of the read-side critical-section
	accesses.  This is OK, because this means that the critical
	section completes before synchronize_srcu()'s checks, and thus
	before any destructive operations following the synchronize_srcu().
2.	srcu_read_unlock()'s counter decrement is perceived by CPU 1
	as happening -before- some of the read-side critical-section
	accesses.  This could be bad, but...  The synchronize_srcu()
	forces CPU 0 to execute a memory barrier on each active CPU,
	including CPU 1.  CPU 0 must subsequently execute a memory
	barrier to become aware of the grace period ending, so that
	it sees -all- CPU 1's earlier memory accesses (required, because
	CPU 0 had to have seen, perhaps indirectly, CPU 1's indication
	that it had gone through a quiescent state).
	Therefore, by the time CPU 0 is done with the synchronize_sched(),
	the memory accesses that CPU 1 executed as part of the SRCU
	read-side critical section must all be visible.
Any sequence of events that has the srcu_read_unlock() happening after
the synchronize_sched() starts is prohibited, since the synchronize_sched()
won't start until the counters all hit zero.
In case people were wondering, the ornateness of the above reasoning is
one reason I have been resisting any attempt to further complicate
the SRCU stuff.  ;-)
