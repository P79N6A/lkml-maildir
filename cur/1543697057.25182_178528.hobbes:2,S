Sorry for the delay, was away and am catching up on mail.
Thanks to Andrey for the fix.  Greg, did you want to add something
else?  Either way, please forward to Linus.
Andrey: the reason everything is in there is I didn't know what Greg
wanted.  He OK'd it, but I'm happy for them to be trimmed, too.
Subject:  [PATCH][2.6.0-test9] prevent catch-all USB aliases in modules.alias
From:     Andrey Borzenkov
Date:     2003-11-03 16:45:03
visor.c defines one empty slot in USB ids table that can be filled in at 
runtime using module parameters. file2alias generates catch-all alias for it:
alias usb:v*p*dl*dh*dc*dsc*dp*ic*isc*ip* visor
patch adds the same sanity check as in depmod to scripts/file2alias.
