Thank you, Michael.
It's a nice article, but I'm using RedHat Linux 9.
It was very easy building chroot environment, for
I used a custom kernel that lists up files which are needed.
(I want to publish the patch, but I made it on business,
permission to publish is not given yet. I'm sorry.)
Only I can't do is 'chroot /jail/ su httpd -c' by one program.
