Doesnt this clash a bit with yours and Arjans no-prisoners-taken 
quest to get rid of order>0 allocations? (4K stacks). 
I implemented this long ago (in 2.1 - bonus points if you still find
the leftover hook), but then gave up on it. I realized that to
use it you would need order>0 allocations. In a single 4K page only 2
1.5K slabs fit, but 2 2K slabs fit as well. And there is already a handy
2K slab that works perfect well.
IMHO it is useless except for architectures with PAGE_SIZE>4K or if 
you fix the VM to handle order>0 allocations really well. If you want
to add it for sparc64/ia64/alpha etc. I would do it with an ifdef
at least.
