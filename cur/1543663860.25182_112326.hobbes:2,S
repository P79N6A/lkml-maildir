I think you must keep these warnings in! There are many bugs
that these uncover uncluding loops that don't terminate correctly
but seem to work for "most all" cases. These are the hard-to-find
bugs that hit you six months after release.
size_t i;
   while((i = do_forever()) > 0)
          ;
... do_forever() finally errors out and returns -1 stuck(forever).
Cheers,
