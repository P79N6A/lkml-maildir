I can confirm that USB has troubles with suspend/resume (I have a Sony vaio
laptop; 
http://perso.wanadoo.es/r_mano/vaio/vaio.html
 ). Especially the
memory key; the only way to not have to reboot to have it is suspending with
the key umounted. 
On the bright side, I doscovered that current (2.6.7) kernel pcmcia and alsa
sound behave perfectly w/ respect of suspend/resume. No need to cardctl
eject before and insert after, my modem continue working after resume; and I
can even suspend with xmms playing and on resume it will continue happily. 
Nice work, a kudo to all!
