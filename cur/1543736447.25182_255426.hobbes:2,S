Well, it _is_.
Because right now the number is meaningless, and the Linux client is 
apparently better off ignoring it totally.
Which was kind of my point to begin with.
If the number doesn't make sense, then we shouldn't look at it. The 
_only_ thing that number makes sense for is st_blocks as far as the Linux 
client is concerned. 
In other words, the Linux client is a hell of a lot better off just taking 
"(filesize + 511) >> 9", as far as I can tell. It's more accurate than the 
random number you have.
