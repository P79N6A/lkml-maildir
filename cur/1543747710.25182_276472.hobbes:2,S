The case of OOM killed sshd is fixable without touching the kernel:
Make sure sshd is started from init, init will then restart sshd whenever
it quits for some reason.  This will get you your essential sshd back
assuming the machine is still running and the OOM killer managed
to free up some memory by killing some other processes.
One might still wish for better OOM behaviour, but it is a case
where something has to give.
