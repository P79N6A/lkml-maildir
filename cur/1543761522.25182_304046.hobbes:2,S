	Hi;
	What is the nature of the 'ide-dev-2.6 tree'? Are there broken
out patches available I can test vs. 2.6.11 or -mm? How do the 'ide fixes'
in -ac intersect with ide-dev? I am also curious if these patches could
have any effect on the pktcdvd problems I have reported.[*]
	Thanks for the feedback.
Paul
