Read controller command byte: 47 - xlate, kie, mie, sysf

Write controller command byte: 56 - disable keyboard and kbd interrupt

Write f0, 56, a4 to mouse output buffer and see whether we read
the same values back. (They are given complemented.)
0f, a9, 5b - yes, we do. There was no special magic here.
We conclude that no multiplexer is present.

Loop test succeeds.

Disable mouse port.

Check that it really has been disabled. But wait!
The disable bit is 0x20, and it was not set.
We conclude that there is no AUX port.
No PS/2 mouse that can be used.
You can to put #if 0 ... #endif around the four
if statements following the comment
/*
 * Bit assignment test - filters out PS/2 i8042's in AT mode
 */
in i8042.c (since also your mouse was filtered away).
