Well, you're right, if it overflows then it will underflow again.  And I've not 
observed any actual failures, and I don't expect to.  But personally I guess I'd 
rather avoid the whole overflow in the first place... maybe I'm being silly.  :)
If you think it's unnecessary code churn then we can not make this change...
