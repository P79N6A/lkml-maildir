One issue (tested the -rc4 Version on -mm):
- on interrupt flood (ping -f) HZ goes down to 0-4 HZ.
  This matches "ticks to skip" below. Coincidence?
- ping -f complains:
.Warning: time of day goes back (-304us), taking countermeasures.

.Warning: time of day goes back (-33us), taking countermeasures.
Yet, system time _seems_ to be kept correctly.
CPU is Pentium M.
dmesg:
Using pmtmr for high-res timesource
dyn-tick: Found suitable timer: pmtmr
dyn-tick: Maximum ticks to skip limited to 54
dyn-tick: Timer not enabled during boot
sysfs:
suitable:       1
enabled:        1
using APIC:     0
