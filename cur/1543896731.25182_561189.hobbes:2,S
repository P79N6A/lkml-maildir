You recommend making the i915 use a workqueue to do this instead, and
remove the drm_lock_tasklet code from the drm_irq.c completely?
Unfortunately, I don't have any boxes with a i915, so I would not feel
comfortable with doing this myself.

To be able to at least continue my work, I'll just keep these as
separate patches.
