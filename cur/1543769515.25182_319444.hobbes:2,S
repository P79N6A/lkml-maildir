Yes, since the process itself that crashed is what is writing the core.
So if a RT process crashes, it writes the core as whatever it was.

This is interesting, since if a RT task is dumping core, that usually
means that it crashed, and therefore there's a bug in the system.  Also,
unless the processes is writing to something that requires a busy wait
(which the serial might do, and probably some flashes), this shouldn't
effect the system.

What can easily be done is switch the task to a non RT priority on the
core dump, after it sends the kill signal to the other tasks sharing the
mm. This way it would not affect the other tasks (and interrupt threads)
so badly.
Ingo, What do you think? Should the dumping of a RT task switch its
priority to a non-rt priority?
