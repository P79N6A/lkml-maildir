It's perfectly normal, but it does NOT conform to the idea "everything is
a file".
The fact that there are other ugly examples (ioctls and special files)
does not mean that adding a new one is a good idea.
When people say "everything is a file", they mean that it can be _used_ as
a file, not that it can passably return a valid error code.
