[Mark, please correct me if I'm wrong]
I suppose that /dev/ppp has been registered by Mark Spencer, who released a 
first Generic PPP patch on 19982308. After some discussions with Mark, I took 
over the development to add Multilink PPP functionality. I added support for 
synchronous WAN adapters, too.
Did you have a look at my recent post on this list :
   [PATCH] Generic PPP (highly experimental, long)
posted on 19991407 ?
What is your new generic PPP layer ? If our goals are the same, could we look 
at this together to avoid a lot of duplicate effort ? After all, if those PPPs 
are really that generic, why should there be two of them lying around ? :-)
