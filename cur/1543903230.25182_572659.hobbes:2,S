Notice our code looks at the return from pci_enable_msix() - it will
give you a hint whether MSI-X is not supported (returns < 0) or you
simply asked for too many (returns > 0).  If the former, then fallback
to legacy; if the latter, try MSI-X with only one interrupt, which
essentially emulates MSI mode.
