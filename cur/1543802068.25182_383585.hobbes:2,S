kmsgdump already shows all of the kernel log buffer that is in
memory (has not been written to disk, basically).
If I (or we) had some time and motivation, I have a
contributed patch to kmsgdump that:
a.  saves and dumps all of the kernel log buffer
    (reminder:  current dump targets are display, parallel port
    printer, and legacy floppy disk)
b.  adds a hard disk dump target and attempts to make this safe
    by pre-reserving and writing each block of it with a
    signature + block number (and maybe more, I'm not sure
    right now)
c.  add x86-64 support
but I have not merged this code into kmsgdump yet, nor have
I even tested it.  I can't test the x86-64 support since I
don't (yet) have an x86-64 system available for this.
If anyone wants to work on this, I'll put the additional
code on the web.
