  Since you are doing the work, you should set your own policy. I might
suggest that if we revert the module stuff to something working in
fewer than five versions you might ping then, and you might wait to
drop stuff of the "xxx fails in 2.5.47 as a module" until modules work
again or we officially go to a monolythic kernel.
