The DST card with CA slot and the DST card without CA slot are two different cases.
Like the Pinnacle PCTV SAT with CI extension and the Pinnacle PCTV SAT without CI extension.
In so far my questions are:
Shouldn't there be two cases for deselecting DST modules?
At least my basic approach tried to distinct those two cases.
In how far is it enough or technically sufficient to treat those two cases as one?
And, as already mentioned: At least in all of those 4 cases no dvb-pll module
isn't needed at all - someone simply forgot to add some lines for the exception handling in dvb-bt8xx to get rid of dvb-pll.c if there is no lgdt330x frontend needed (read: if there is no Fusion HDTV Lite card in the machine at all).
If this small case is being fixed you simply can expand the deselection of dvb-pll.c
on all cards treated in backend module dvb-bt8xx.c.
