This one here:

looks perfectly fucked up.  This way every file including netfilter_arp.h
will get it's own copy of arpt_mutex which certainly doesn't help
synchronization.
But in fact I can only see a single file actually using it, that's
arp_tables.c where it was defined previously.  What's going on here?
