*grrrr* it is too late on evening (I'm living in germany ;) )...
I also fogot to tell following:
Error for wireless request "Set Frequency" (8B04) :
    SET failed on device eth2 ; Input/output error.
I got this message if I try to start the net device with the init.d script.
If I try to set the channel per hand I got no error but the channel gets not 
set (it still is 0). But I am able to set the mode and the essid.
Any ideas?
Daniel
