Sorry, I should have put the exchange between Li and I in there.
(Ouch, and I didn't cc: Li this time!  Sorry, Li.)
Li thought it was 2.6.27/2.6.27 material.  I thought not, but wanted
to see what the -stable folks thought.
This is not a security hole, and since noone has complained before
it doesn't appear to be too inconvenient.  Until the fix goes
up, container users can always create the fifos and socks on the
root image while creating the container, before entering the
device whitelist.
