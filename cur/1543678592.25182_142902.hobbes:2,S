Yes, that seems to be the case. (All the LBA32 code is from John
Coffman. I've copied him in case he's interested in the thread.)
But you're still betting on the BIOS to either implement EDD
correctly, or at least to report that it doesn't support it.
Call me paranoid, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if there are
some BIOSes out there that get this wrong.
