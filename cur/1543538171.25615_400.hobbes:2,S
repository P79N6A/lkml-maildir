Sure, that works, but I wouldn't call it "linking".

If you can avoid wasting memory, this is great.

It isn't just for them. The binary+source vendors can use it too.
Many users will want binaries, even if source is available.

No, you can use a pure PentiumIII-SMP kernel as long as it provides
the code-modification services for generic modules. Compiled-in
drivers simply don't call (or trap to) the self-modification engine.

It is extra effort to ensure that the two kernels are identical
in all ways except debugging support.
