So exec.c code should go looking for fs type and try and match it
against some table?  OK...

Ahem.  You had made several capabilities equivalent to "everything".
E.g. "anyone who can override checks in chown() can set arbitrary
capabilities", etc.  Which changes model big way and makes the affected
capabilities pretty much useless - they can be elevated to any other
capability.

mount --bind /usr/bin /mnt
Suddenly /mnt/foo and /usr/bin/foo (same file) have different capabilities.
