Perhaps I should say "compiler memory barrier", since it doesn't prevent
instructions from being moved, but rather merely affects the ordering of
memory accesses and volatile instructions.
Hmmm... Is atomic_read() a compiler memory barrier? It isn't a CPU memory
barrier, but it does touch explicitly volatile memory.
