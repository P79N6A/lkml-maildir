Agreed.  The only thing I was thinking, was if the kernel is doing the
right thing now, it shouldn't be forced to work around a bug in XFree.
By not "fixing" the kernel, the XFree team would be forced to do the right
thing.
As for me, I'm going to see about getting the matroxfb working, so if the
patch goes in I'll be able to use a nice 132 character wide terminal
again.  And I'm getting addicted to dual head in X, might be fun on the
console too.
