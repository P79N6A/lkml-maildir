Something I've been meaning to hack up for a while is some spinlock
debugging code that adds a FUNCTION_SLEEPS() to (ta-da) functions that
may sleep. This macro then checks whether we're currently holding any
locks, and if so printk's the names of locks held, and where they were taken.
When I came up with the idea[1] I envisioned some linked-lists frobbing,
but in more recent times, we can now check the preempt_count for a
quick-n-dirty implementation (without the additional info of which locks
we hold, lock-taker, etc).

[1] Not an original idea, in fact I think Ingo came up with an
    implementation back in `98 or so.
