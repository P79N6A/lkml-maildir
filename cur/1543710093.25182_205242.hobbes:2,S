Yes, I'll add my welcome to that.

Actually, it would be my interpretation of the FAQ that most of this
work is already intended (although Jeff gave specific instances than the
generalities in the FAQ).
There were many more places than this in the driver that caused me to go
"good grief no".  However, it probably makes more sense if you work down
your todo list and come back for a review when you're nearing the end of
it.  That way you don't get boat loads of comments about things you were
planning to fix anyway.
