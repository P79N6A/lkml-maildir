hello all
I am writing two user level filter which interacts through each other
using TCP sockets.Now as traffic is local, it is passed through the
loopback interface. That is my design constraint.
I want to force the local traffic between particular interfaces to go
through bridge where i want to do some sort of NAT.To force the
traffic to bridge, i m opening up two tap devices and using
SO_BINDTODEVICE options to force the traffic to bypass loopback. But
connection is not getting established.
Is this design feasible.
Best Regards
rana
