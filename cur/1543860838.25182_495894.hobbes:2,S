Hi Andrew,
Sorry, I am yet to check out Venki's and Oleg's patches as I
just returned from Vacation.

These patches are needed because they allow us to send out the "failed"
notifications to only those subsystems that received the "prepare"
notifications earlier.

These were posted inorder to have a common place where the subsystems
could lock their per-subsystem hotplug mutexes/semaphore from within the
cpu-hotplug-callback function. Hence they are needed IMO.

These patches define and use a mutex to handle cpu-hotplug and eliminate
the use of lock_cpu_hotplug in sched.c. Hence they are still needed.

Again, this one ensures that workqueue_mutex is taken/released on
CPU_LOCK_ACQUIRE/CPU_LOCK_RELEASE events in the cpuhotplug callback
function. So this one is required, unless it conflicts with what Oleg
has posted. Will check that out tonite.

If all goes fine (w.r.t cpufreq and workqueue), eliminating
lock_cpu_hotplug from kernel/*.c should be relatively easy.<fingers crossed>
Thanks and Regards
