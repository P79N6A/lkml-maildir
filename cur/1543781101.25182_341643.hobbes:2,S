Subject: [patch 38/39] [RFC] remap_file_pages protection support: avoid dirtying on read faults for NONUNIFORM pages
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
When installing pages on non-uniform VMA's, even for read faults we must
install them writable if the VMA is writable (we won't have a chance to fix
that). Normally, on write faults, we install the PTE as dirty (there's a
comment about 80386 on this), but maybe it's not needed here on read faults.
I've looked for more info about that comment - unfortunately, it's there
almost unchanged since 2.4.0, so I've found no info.
However, UML does depend on the old behaviour currently (trivial to cure,
anyway). And if other arch's don't have an hardware "dirty" bit, they'll
depend on this too.
