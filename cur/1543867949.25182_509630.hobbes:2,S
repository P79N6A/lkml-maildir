Strong. But saying for others usualy tends to show own problems.

That is too cool phrase to be heared - if you will make me a favour and
reread what was written you will (hopefully) detect that there were no
words about interfaces being changed after put into the wild - talk was 
only about time when system is designed and implemented, and there is
time for discussion about its rough edges - if its design is good, then
interface can be changed in a moment without any problem - that is what
we see with syslets right now - they are designed and implemented (the
formed was done several years ago), and it is time to shape its edges -
like change userspace API - it is easy, but you do not (want/like to) 
see that.

But my above words are too lame for self-hearing Olympus liver.
Definitely.
