could be a pain for us. I'll check again what I can do for this ...

I saw it in a previous thread but was not sure it was related to my problem.
I was on my way to test it anyway !

When the server was hung, we were not able to get anything, but I'll try

I'll let you know asap. I don't think I'll be able to reboot the server from
home this weekend. At least, I'll prepare a new kernel with the patch and
install it on Monday morning.
Regards,
Sylvain.
