Err, "faster"?  The following is the moral equiv of 4 kernel updates
which had nothing to do using BitKeeper instead of CVS.  The local copy
was in San Francisco and the remote copy is Cort's machine in New Mexico
over a 384Kbits/sec link.  All 4 updates in 5 seconds.  Anyone have a
CVS tree they can try to get comparable numbers?
At the risk of being slashdot-ed, you can browse these trees with BK's
replacement for CVSweb at
