Well, its the same library everyone else is using to do things they
shouldn't be doing ;)
I'm very interested in your new  scheme for device discovery.  It seems
like the best and most reasonable way to go forward.
But, tossing things into libblkid also makes sense.  It isn't much work,
and it allows btrfs to fit in with the established norms while we
experiment with new and better ways to hook it all together.
