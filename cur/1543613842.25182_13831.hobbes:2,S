Yep.  I said "Y" rather than "M" to the questions under "general
setup"..."PCMCIA/CardBus support" that applied to me.  The "sockets" it
refers to would be provided by either the cardbus support, or one of the
PCMCIA bridges.
I probably could have got away with the appropriate modprobe command, but
it seems to be out of fashion these days to include the name of the module
a kernel configuration option compiles to in the help text for that
option.
