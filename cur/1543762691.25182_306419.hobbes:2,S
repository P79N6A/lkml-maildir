Very strange. I am running 2.6.11 + timer patches +
	#define del_singleshot_timer_sync(t) del_timer_sync(t)
without any problems.
This timer is private to schedule_timeout(), it can't change
base, so del_timer_sync() should be "obviously correct" in
that case.
What kernel version? Could you try this stupid patch?
Oleg.
