Really?  And you're unconcerned about the impact on the rest of the system
of a UML grabbing (say) 128M of memory when it starts up?  Especially if it
may never use it?
And I don't see anything wrong with starting a bunch of UMLs with a total
maximum memory exceeding the available tmpfs as long as they don't all need
all that memory at once.  And, if they do, the patch I just posted will let
them deal fairly sanely with the situation.
