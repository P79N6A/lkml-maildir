Yes, it does.

You can't simply define it to a nop in case of SMP, because
there it is called from a different place, but we could
have a separate version for UP and SMP in sched.h:
void update_process_times(int user_tick);
static inline void update_process_times_nonsmp(int user_tick)
{
#ifndef CONFIG_SMP
	update_process_times(user_tick);
#endif
}
