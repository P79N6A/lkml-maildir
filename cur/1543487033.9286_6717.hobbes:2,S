The second version of the patch-set (19990221) works much better
than the first with a newly-installed 2.2.2 kernel on an i386
system.  Silly of me not to realize that the kernel would load
the appropriate module when a BFS partition is mounted (as I
too-hastily posted in the message which began this thread).
I haven't had any kernel error messages at all with the new
patch.  Copying and viewing files works fine, though the symlinks
don't point to the correct files, since Be calls '/' '/boot'.  I
noticed that the Midnight Commander's internal file-viewer is
confused somehow by Be ASCII text files and displays them
strangely, though editors and the Most pager can load the files
and display them well.  The file utility identifies Be files
correctly.   Good work!  If you do succeed in making the bfs
driver read-write won't that confuse the Be system when it boots?
