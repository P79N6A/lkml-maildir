Ok so DMA memory restrictions not conforming to the DMA zones? The 
example is a bit weird. DMA only to the first 32k of memory? If the limit 
would be higher like 16MB then we would not have an issue. Is there really 
a device that can only do I/O to the first 32k of memory?
How do we split that up today? We could add processing to submit_bio to 
check for the boundary and create two bios.

As large as mkxxxfs allowed it to be. For XFS and extX with the current 
patchset 32k is the limit (64k with the fixes to ext2) but a new 
filesystem could theoretically use a larger blocksize.
