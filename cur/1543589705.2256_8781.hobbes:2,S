That's not good enough. The NFS client needs to know when it is in
sync with the server...

Yes. See the NFS-HOWTO for details.

That can easily happen if the client thinks that the file is longer
than it is on the server. A client has to rely on its cached value of
the file length in order to append to a file, since it has to specify
an offset at which to write. If that offset exceeds the current file
length, the server does the equivalent of a truncate() to extend the
file.
See RFC1094 and RFC1813 for further details on how NFS implements
reading and writing...
