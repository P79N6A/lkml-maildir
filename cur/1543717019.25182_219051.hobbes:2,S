there are 2 angles here:
1) there already is "GPL with additional rights" which LGPL is just one
form of
and
2) if you mix LGPL with GPL (eg kernel), the LGPL license itself says it
autoconverts to GPL, so you can't even have a LGPL module *loaded*.
(Not saying that your source can't be LGPL but when you link it into the
kernel at runtime it turns GPL)
