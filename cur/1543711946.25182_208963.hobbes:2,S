Well, not all printks() are errors this hard. And at some points, it
is no longer possible to abort (after pagedir is on disk, its okay to
panic (machine will resume normally after that), but its not okay to
simply return. You could fix signature then return, but it would be hard).

It continues. Fortunately powerdown takes enough time on most machines
that messages can be readed ... if you pay attetion.
