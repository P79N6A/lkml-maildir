I implemented something kind of like this for the discontig project,
but I called it /proc/discontig.  The patch just walked all the
pgdata_t structures and did its best to find out where the memory was
being used.  See 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/discontig
 for the
patch.  The first column of the output should probably be called
'region' or something, since it's not NUMA specific at all...
