The /etc/hosts file that was installed with the Slackware that ran on
my first Linux machine contained a comment strongly advising against
associating 127.0.0.1 with the hostname (or anything other than
localhost).  Apparently some programs (which I don't recall) would
break if you did so.  I have followed that advice ever since.
