Maybe you could try pushing the use of klive by some distros arguing
it's "a way of getting usage statistics in order to improve kernel
quality and hardware support". I mean, not just an extra package but a
service launch at the first boot so anyone can use it.
klive is a nice project, it just needs more _different_ users and
maybe, a support of some distros.
Maybe, you could try add a page in the klive wiki for putting packages
and RPMs of klive for several distros ? What do you think ? It's a
first step to get it merge into distros.
In my case, I got some .tgz that feel lonely...
Maybe be in 2 years, we will know EXACTLY of much people use
EXT4/Reiser5/CoincoinFS/CrashFS...
