As an alternative, you can relatively easily rewrite the following
independent histories:
A -- B -- C
X -- Y -- Z
To look like this:
A -- B -- C -- X' -- Y' -- Z'
Where X' is (C + sub/dir/X), Y' is (C + sub/dir/Y), etc...
Assuming the following:
  "master" branch points to commit C
  "child" branch points to commit Z
  "${KIDSTART}" is the SHA1 id of commit X
echo "${KIDSTART} $(git rev-parse --verify master)" >>.git/info/grafts
git filter-branch --index-filter 'git read-tree master && git
read-tree --prefix="sub/dir/" "${GIT_COMMIT}"' -- master..child
The one downside is then somebody actually has to *test* those commits
when doing a bisect, even though they did not materially change
anything.  The upside is that there isn't any "what the hell just
happened?" when you *do* end up in the newly-created branch.
