no.
We're working on a solution where we make sure that the PHY is physically 
turned on properly before we read the EEPROM, which would be the proper fix. 
It's completely not acceptable to run when the EEPROM checksum fails - you 
might even be running with the wrong MAC address, or worse. Lets fix this the 
right way instead.
