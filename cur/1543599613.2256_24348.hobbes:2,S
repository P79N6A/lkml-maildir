Lots of apic errors imply problems on the link between the processors and
io controller. A few is basically ok (there is a checksum) but a huge number
and one day it'll checksum a bad frame ok and you are history
There is also a problem with Linus tree where apic errors causing event
replays where the erroring component was not the CPUs can cause crashes.
That is fixed in -ac.
