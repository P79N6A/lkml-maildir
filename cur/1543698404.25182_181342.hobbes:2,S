Are you booting with Lilo? Then you could try to pass the vga=normal 
parameter to the bootloader in lilo.conf . I'm not sure with Grub, but I 
bet somebody else here is.
If you let the booting progress continue blind-headed, can you login or 
wait for X to start? It's possible that the system actually boots, just 
that you don't see it.
