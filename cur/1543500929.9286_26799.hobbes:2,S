i've also noticed that 2.3.8 is slower.  but i think the problem is that
swapping hasn't been tuned properly for the new page cache logic -- this
results in more iterations through shrink_mmap(), where cached state gets
dropped. this will slow things down.
i also believe that a multithreaded page cache for file data won't help
much if the file system is still serialized :)
