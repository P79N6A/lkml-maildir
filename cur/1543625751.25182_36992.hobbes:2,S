I would think that "large page support" that the processors give you
is indeed unusable, but what do you think about "software large(r)
pages"?
What I mean is that instead of doing the 4k that the ia32 hardware
gives us, we pretend that pages are (e.g.) 8k. Thus we always load a
pair of page table entries. memmap ends up having 8k granularity, IO
is done on page-sized (i.e. 8k in this case) chunks etc etc. (%)
So we have a "PAGE_SIZE" define all around the kernel. Keep that the
same (for compatibility), but make a "REAL_PAGE_SIZE" that governs the
loop that actually sets the page table (or tlb) entries.... Note that
a first implementation may actually effectivly reduce the size of the
TLB on machines with a software loaded TLB....
Why would I want this? Well, suppose I have a machine that unavoidably
has to swap on some of its workload. In practise you will almost
double the disk troughput by increasing the page size by a factor of
two.  If the hit rate on the "extra page" that you swap in by
pretending pages are 8k and not 4k is over a couple of percents (*),
then this is advantageous: A seek plus transfer of 4k costs say 10ms +
0.16us while a seek plus transfer of 8k costs 10ms + .33 us (#). Thus
the "penalty" of the extra 4k transfer is very, very small.
Now, for all the reasons you mention, keeping 4k as the "default" on
Intel is good. But a config option:
                on      on
	       intel   alpha
page size: 	4k
		8k	8k
		16k 	16k 
		32k	32k
		64k	64k
		128k	128k
would also be good for some people. 
				Roger. 
(*) Actually it has to be a "couple of percents better than the 4k
page that we had to evict to be able to accomodate the current extra
4k...
(#) A 10k RPM disk rotates in 6ms, so average rotational latency is
about 3ms, and with an average seek time of 7ms, that comes to 10ms.
(%) And we get ext2 8k block size support on ia32!
