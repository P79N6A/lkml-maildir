SGIO_TO_FROM_DEVICE is *not* bdirectional!
From the header that defines it:
#define SG_DXFER_TO_FROM_DEV -4 /* treated like SG_DXFER_FROM_DEV with the
                                   additional property than during indirect
                                   IO the user buffer is copied into the
                                   kernel buffers before the transfer */
That's pretty darned clear.  TO_FROM_DEVICE is a straight-up read.
Why the continuing confusion of what this mode is for?
