The LZF licensing has been corrected so it's not a problem.

That will be because you're eating most of the memory anyway; there's
not problem finding enough memory to copy the Highmem too. I guess that
once we start seeing people trying to suspend 2GB to disk or you try to
eat less memory, Highmem will become more of a pain.

Sorry. I said it in so many ways! It's not really an issue though;
processes are stopped and suspend's own I/O doesn't touch page cache.

I want it to be simple and clear too. I'm getting there. As part of the
cleanup, I'd just made suspend modular, which has further untangled some
of the interdependancies between sections of code. I still have more
work to do, but I'm increasingly feeling like removing the debugging
code.

I'll submit a patch. I need to look at how you use the refrigerator
first. I refrigerate processes prior to resuming as well, and might need
to adjust things if you don't do that. I also need to check it will work
okay with S3.

Well, if you insist, I'll do what I can. I looked at doing this before,
but was like trying to describe how to transform a mini into a station
wagon while using it every day! It will, of course, make the merge
_much_ slower too.
