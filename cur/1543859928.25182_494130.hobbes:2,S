That would be a propritary fuel injection driver then.
What we want however is access to the documentation, the 
specifications, that allows us to develop a very own driver, 
independently from the propritary one. We don't want source code or 
anything. Of course if the hardware manufactor supplies us with 
source code, that's great.
Probably any customly written driver will be suboptimal in the first 
place, but OTOH there are so many skilled people around in the OSS 
scene, that such a driver would surely soon catch up, if not even 
surpass the propritary one.
Happy holydays
