Well, that part works now, actually.  Feel free to steal anything you

I don't, although I'm trying to make it as easy as possible to port
filesystems from the Linux kernel, by keeping a VFS layer which is
reasonably similar to the one in Linux.  My goal is to initially support
ext2, iso9660 and FAT.  NTFS would be nice for NT users, of course; not
sure how practical that is though.  I've considered using libext2 for
the ext2 part of the filesystem; either that or using the Linux 2.0.37
ext2; I have been using 2.0.37 as my main source of stolen code.
