Linus,
What's the current state of merges with Alan? I'm sorry for asking this, but 
it's being too dificult to choose what tree to use, and IMHO I don't see any 
reason for not merging all the known stable code from Alan's tree. 
It probably would make the life of too many people easier. ;-)
Best Regards,
Thiago Vinhas
