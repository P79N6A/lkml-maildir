Yes, that's on my list.  Unfortunately this has so far only been seen
on my workstation, and I have to get a bit of work done before I can
pursue this.  At least I can get some candidates built in the
background.
I have tried a few things quickly with 22-rc2, and the short summary
is:
 * noapic makes no difference (don't recall why I had UP APIC enabled)
 * disabling DMA w/hdparm stops the corruption (all normal operation
   and previous testing has been with DMA enabled)
 * mounting w/ -o sync makes no difference except to slow things down

flowcharts; they'll be obvious.  -- Brooks
