There are many ways of getting things wrong. The algorithm for encoding 
UTF-8 doesn't give you the option of encoding 65 as two bytes; any UCS-4 
character with code 0-0x7F must result in a onand the same principle goes 
for every other character and the unicdeo standard forbids the use of anything
but the shortest possible sequence.

In UTF-8 you cannot represent à as `a. I can have both in a file name and they
are different. An application that assumes `a is the same a à (in UTF-8) is broken
and should be fixed.
