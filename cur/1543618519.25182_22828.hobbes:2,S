No you're wrong.  Not writing docs wastes the time of other developers.  It 
sends the message 'my time is more important than yours'.  In the case of 
Linus, that may be true, but it's very definitely not true for any other core 
developer.
It is the responsibility of each developer to prepare at least minimal - but 
sufficient - documentation for the work they do.  Others who specialize in 
preparing documentation can then use that material as a starting point for 
preparing clearer, more extensive documentation.  But if core developers shirk 
their responsibility in this area, we will continue to suffer from a chronic 
shortage of good, current kernel documentation.
