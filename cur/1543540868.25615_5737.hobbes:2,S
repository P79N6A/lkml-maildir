After much distilling, I've found the critical thing that Hiroaki
Nagoya's at1700 driver does differently from the one in the mainstream
tree.  This patch prevents the card from locking up completely during
a transmit timeout.  I have no manuals and I don't know why it works,
but it does, and the change seems harmless enough...
