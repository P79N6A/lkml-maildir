hi.
i believe there is some problems with amd64-agp driver.
on vanilla kernels, i have tried (2.6.0-test4 - 2.6.4-rc2) it doesent
work, the X just freezes before the wm start, and i cant stop X or
anything, but i can ssh into it, restart box, if i kill X, the box locks
up, so even magic sysrq key doesent work.
BUT
in 2.6.4-rc1-mm2 it worked... almost... sometimes the box could freeze
and X used 100% cpu, but i could still ssh into it. and restart.
now with 2.6.4-rc2-mm1 it doesent work either.
without the amd64-agp i have alot slower graphics, and whenever i start
anything that uses opengl, X goes to 100% cpu usage. but with amd64-agp
like 1-10%
any ideas? or known fixes
my system specs:
asus k8v deluxe with via k8t800 chipset
amd64 3200+
gf4 mx 440 agp8x
