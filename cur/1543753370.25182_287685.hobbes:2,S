Good Point.
My bad. Thanks for bringing this up. Obviously this didn't get as
much attention as it should've had the last time it was posted,
especially as it allows very easy scripting of filtering in userspace.
That email you refer to is pretty loaded and I'm sure those who
are interested will dig through it. But in the interest of helping
everyone get a rapid understanding of what it does and how it does it,
can you break it down in to a short description, possibly with a
diagram? I'm sure many will find this very interesting.
Thanks,
Karim
