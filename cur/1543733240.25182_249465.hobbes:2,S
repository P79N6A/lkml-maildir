Albert,
I am serious.

HZ is an integer however.

What do you do if one clock lacks resolution, and the other clock lacks digits? 
The interrupt clock may suck, but the TSC sucks even more.

HZ is HZ, but the true interrupt frequency is something completely different.

Are you saying you are happy with a lcok that less than 1 HZ off? That would be -- 
in a extreme case -- about 86000 seconds off per day.

Make jiffies follow variable CPU clock? Are you serious?

It's not useless, it's a historic standard.

It depends on what you want. The kernel really needs a working framework for 
nanoseconds; at least regarding the variables' precision.
