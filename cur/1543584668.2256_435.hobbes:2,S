I think I've figured it out.. at least I've found a way to reproduce
the exact errors to the last detail and some pretty nasty corruption
to go with it.  The operator must help though.. a lot ;-)
If you do mount -o remount /dev/somedisk / thinking that that will get
rid of your /dev/ram0 root, that isn't the case, and you will corrupt
the device you remounted (I did it to a scratch monkey) very badly when
you write to the still mounted ramdisk.
You must exec a shell (or something) chrooted to your mounted harddisk
to un-busy the old root and then pivot_root/unmount that old root.  I
tested this, and all is well.
I think this is a consequence of the multiple mount changes.. not sure.
(ergo cc to Al Viro.. he knows eeeeverything about mount points)
