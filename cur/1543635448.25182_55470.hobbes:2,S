Care to try the next version? I've completely disabled task file i/o
since it does seem to be broken in pio, and fixed the multi-write
multi-page bio bug as well. There are a number of other changes in
there. There are split patches like last time, but also one big patch:
*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/patches/v2.5/2.5.25/
00_25ide-compile-1a
	no changes, rediffed
05_25pci-ids-1a
	no changes, rediffed
10_24ide-core-2
	various fixes, see old/ for the complete list
15_24-misc-bits-2
	added (broken) sparc64 bits. too lazy to revert these right,
	waiting for update
20_ide-build-config-1a
	consolidate config and build split
25_ide-scsi-1
	no changes, rediffed
and finally,
ide24-for-2.5-2
	all of the above
Also pull'able from bk://linux25-24ide@project.bkbits.net/linux25-24ide
(soonish)
