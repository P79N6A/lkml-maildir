Unfortunately, the AUX port isn't just a serial port. The electrical
protocol on it assumes that an ack byte for each byte sent to the
device. Yes, this is common to both mice and keyboards. So, it *might*
be reasonable to expect a response like that from the device, although
I'd prefer not to do that.
