In general, you _have to_ upgrade modutils to at least a 2.3.x revision.
If you use devfs, you almost have to install devfsd, and you really need
to upgrade util-linux (there's a bug in older versions of /bin/login that
barf on the new tty scheme).
I usually do it by compiling and installing a 2.4 kernel; compiling,
installing devfsd (and adding an entry very early in rc.sysinit for it);
installing modutils; and installing util-linux -- then rebooting to test
the new kernel.
