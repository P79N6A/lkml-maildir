Actually I was wrong. SO consists of one big core module and a number of
private libraries (23 of them!). This is a big win when it comes to
multi-user Linux systems

Tee-hee. It's just not your day isn't it? X isn't evil - software has no
concepts of "good" and "evil", but let's not get philosophical now. OK, I

for posting this.
