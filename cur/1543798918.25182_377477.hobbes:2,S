Yes, that's what is supposed to happen with that patch.

Of course the patch doesn't do what we talked about.  It says so right in 
the Changelog comment.
I disagree with the idea of disconnecting the device.  The right thing to 
do is what David wanted all along: unbind the driver.  This would require 
only a small change to the driver core.
It's too late for me to work on this now, but maybe tomorrow I'll have to 
a chance to write something.
