This shouldn't include the USB stack, FWIW; nothing in drivers/usb
makes such calls (on 2.6).  The device drivers don't have any
reason to use such calls, either.

Or just bypassing it before it gets to __dma_alloc(), which would
be ugly but functional.  Or flagging the devices in question as
needing to use that particular memory zone ... so for example a
dma_zone(dev) macro, used with alloc_pages_node(), might be a
cleaner approach.

That's hardly a vast difference, no!

Right, and the whole USB stack should "just work" once that's done.
Subject to memory cramping for some uses!  :)

I'm clearly on the "yes" side, though I suspect Deepak is right
that doing it very cleanly as an all-arch extension may not be
a near-term 2.6 option.
