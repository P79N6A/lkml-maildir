Anyone can apply the apparmour patch to their tree, they get the
choice that way.  Nobody is currently prevented from using apparmour
if they want to, any such suggestion is pure rubbish.
It is even more incredulious to imply that just by having apparmour
in the upstream kernel all the userland bits will magically appear
on every user's distribution.
Give me a break.
What you get by the code going into the upstream kernel tree is that
it a) adds some pseudo legitimacy to AppArmour (which I don't
personally think is warranted) and b) gets the work of keeping
apparmour working with upstream largely off of your back and in the
hands of the upstream community.
Neither of those are reasons why something should go into the tree.
Frankly I think AppArmour is a joke, and all of this integration with
LSM business is just a face saving effort, nothing more.  And saving
face is not, and has never been, a reason for something to be put into
the upstream tree.
