Jens, I have the problem that: 
stat("/dev/hdc", {st_mode=S_IFIFO|S_ISGID|S_ISVTX, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
open("/dev/hdc", O_RDONLY)              = -1 ERRNO_123 (No medium found)
So that my boot script to change parameters does not work. hdparm is
release 3.5. kernel 2.2.10. RH 6.0. I have to put a cdrom to let the
driver accept -u 1.
Am I doing something wrong?
