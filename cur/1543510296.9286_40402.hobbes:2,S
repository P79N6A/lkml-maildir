That's not what 'built-ins' means. Of course you use 'C'. However, I
think you would like the kernel source code to be the source of the
kernel, not the kernel source code plus a C compiler library that
was generated when the 'C' compiler was compiled (from a previous
C-Compiler, no less....)
FYI. I like the assembler idea, but it would take way too long. I like
the idea of the code being exactly what I wrote, not some compiler's
idea of how to do it better.
