Regarding if shrinking the unmapped LRU only is bad or not: In the
vanilla version of refill_inactive_zone(), if reclaim_mapped is false
then mapped pages are rotated on the active list without the
young-bits are getting cleared in the PTE:s. I would say this is very
similar to leaving the pages on the mapped active list alone as long
as reclaim_mapped is false in the dual LRU case. Do you agree?
Also, losing history, do you mean that the order of the pages are not
kept? If so, then I think my refill_inactive_zone() rant above shows
that the order of the pages are not kept today. But yes, keeping the
order is probaly a good idea.
It would be interesting to hear what you mean by "pressure", do you
mean that both the active list and inactive list are scanned?
Many thanks,
