One interesting thing here would be to have some optional link between
the bus-oriented device tree and the function-oriented tree (ie. devfs
or simply /dev). For example, an IDE node in driverfs could eventually
hold symlinks to the entries it provides in /dev when using devfs (or
just provide major/minor when not using devfs).
What do you think ?
One problem I've been faced with on ppc is to be able to match
a linux device with what the firmware (Open Firmware) thinks that
device is. The firmware view is bus-centered and it would be pretty
easy to provide some additional entries in driverfs that give the
OF fullpath of a given device. But then, the link between the actual
driver in driverfs and the "device" as used by, for example, the
filesystem isn't trivial.
