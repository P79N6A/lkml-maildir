I disagree on that. The window is small and slowing down 99.99999% of all 
users who never care about this for this extremely obscure misdesigned API does 
not make  much sense to me.
Also if you worry about these you could add an optional sysctl
to always take it, so if anybody really has an application that relies
on the first time stamp being accurate and they cannot use SO_TIMESTAMP
they could set the sysctl.
