Subject: Should page->count ever be -1?

I'm experiencing some kind of memory leaks playing with ioremap and iounmap,
and I've narrowed down the problem to iounmap refusing to unmap the memory that
I just mapped.  The line of code in question is
	if (!PageReserved(page) && atomic_dec_and_test(&page->count)) {
from page_alloc.c (this is 2.2.18pre15).  It appears that page->count is
already zero when this code is executed, and after it's executed, page->count
becomes -1 (or more accurately, 0xFFFFFFFF).  Is this acceptable, or is it an
error condition?
