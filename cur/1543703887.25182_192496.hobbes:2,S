I like C++ and hate to see it so unfairly maligned.  Here's a much
better example:
Makefile:
helloc: hello.c
        gcc -Os -s -o helloc hello.c
hellocpp: hello.cpp
        g++ -Os -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions -s -o hellocpp hello.cpp
Both programs contain exactly the same code: one main() function using
puts("Hello world!").
# ls -l
-rwxrwxr-x    1 jbriggs  jbriggs      2840 Jan 20 10:02 helloc
-rwxrwxr-x    1 jbriggs  jbriggs      2948 Jan 20 10:06 hellocpp
108 extra bytes is hardly the end of the world.
