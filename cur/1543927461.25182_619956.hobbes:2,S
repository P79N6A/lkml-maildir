Your machine decided to emit interrupt 21 without an apparent reason.
Whatever caused that made the kernel shut down IRQ 21 at which point the
disk drives on that IRQ were no longer being serviced. Everything on IRQ
21 would have died - which may be why your networking failed too.
What do you have on IRQ 21 and is this a one off ?
