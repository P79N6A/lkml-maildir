The IPchains support won't build unless (I assume) connection tracking
is enabled however.  And once you say "Y" to that, it's removed from the
list of options.  I must admit, I'm not personally too worried about
making this work now, because I just decided to switch to using IPtables
instead.
Getting IPtables to work when static-linked into the kernel would be a
bonus though.  Currently iptables whinges about not being able to find
"filter" when the modules are static linked, but (subject to a small
patch on the ipfilter mailing list) works just fine when loaded as modules.
