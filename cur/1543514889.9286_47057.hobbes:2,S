Gerard,
The Statement relates to increased parallelism on FS code paths (they
don't have to block), and allows multiple I/O requests to be handled as
a "bundle" rather than one at a time.  The benefit is immediately
obvious since less time is spent calling semaphore and sync code in the
kernel (shorter code paths, less rendudant calling of sync code).  There
are also benefits for remirroring since disk reqests can now be
coalesced into runs and ordered based on block number for elevator
seeking.  Understand now?
