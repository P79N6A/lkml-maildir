This statement is in a comment at the top of every file in
the patch:
  * This software is being distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
  * License version 2.  Some or all of the technology encompassed by this
  * software may be subject to one or more patents pending as of the date of
  * this notice.  No additional patent license will be required for GPL
  * implementations of the technology.  If you want to create a non-GPL
  * implementation of the technology encompassed by this software, please
  * contact legal@mvista.com for details including licensing terms and fees.
I believe that this meets any required legal criteria for unencumbered
use in the Linux kernel (or other GPL projects).
