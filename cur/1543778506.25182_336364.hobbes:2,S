We still have the mpt-fusion problem :-(   That one appears to
be more convoluted ... we don't seem to be calling the suspend
functions more than once, but I still see the "Badness" messages
from iosapic_unregister_intr().  There may also be an ordering
problem where we shutdown some bits of mpt-fusion, and then later
call the suspend function for another layer to sync out some
SCSI stuff, but it is toast because the device is already down.
