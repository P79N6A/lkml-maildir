   Now you are talking complete and total crap. I tested this firmware removal
   stuff on a QlogicFC 2100 card. It works fine
It works fine in your x86-centric world, on your x86 BIOS card.
It breaks on every UltraSparc system I have with qlogic,fc onboard.
One powercycle or PCI master abort, and I am unbootable.
And I am the one talking crap? :-)
