To get an inode number from user space you can simply use the "stat" or
"fstat" functions. You don't need to create your own module.

Is this really a problem? The dentry cache should make this quite fast,
leaving the bottleneck to the actual write on disk of the result.
I tried a small program (if it can be called a program) to create a
thousand directories and it takes less than 100 ms on my machine.
