Subject: KDE confuses 2.6.19-rc1+ AKA "cdrom: This disc doesn't have any tracks I recognize!"

I'm seeing a very strange problem.
With every post 2.6.18 kernel I've tried [2.6.19-rc1 -->
2.6.19-rc1-gc25d5180], the kernel is "confused" by KDE.
If I boot without starting KDE and put in a CD/DVD it works correctly.
If I start KDE and then put in a CD the kernel tells:
	cdrom: This disc doesn't have any tracks I recognize!
Manually mount still works but KDE shows it as a blank CD and I
cannot mount it through "media:/".
The kernel stays "confused" even if I close KDE...
I'm using KDE 3.5.4.
