You're welcome. I'm also not concerned because the cost is linear with
the amount of memory (and the cost has an high bound, that is the size
of the lower zones, so it's not like the struct page that is a
percentage of ram guaranteed to be lost) so it's generally not
noticeable at runtime, and it's most important in the big systems (where
in turn the cost is higher).
