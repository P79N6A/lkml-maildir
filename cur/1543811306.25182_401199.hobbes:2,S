Thanks Mark
I'm glad it's a bug and not bad hardware.
I am quite concerned that the basic effect of just booting a practically
vanilla 2.6.16-rc4 like this was to fry my raid array.
Luckily it dropped 2 (of  3) disks so quickly that the event counter was
the same allowing an easy rebuild.
2.6.15 has similar issues but they seem to happen *very* infrequently by
comparison - this hit me several times during a single boot.
Should Linus (cc'ed) hold off on 2.6.16 because of this or not?
