I've been asking that question ever since most popular distributions
started putting a copy of bash in /bin/sh.
WHY oh WHY would they do that. Ugh.
This is one of the reasons why many BSD (and commercial unix) folks don't
like Linux. (It isn't the kernel they have a problem with. its the
operability of said software.)
