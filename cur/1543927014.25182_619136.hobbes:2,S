Hrm, a quick grep in the kernel tree shows me that the imm_* namespace
is already quite clobbered (although I do not detect any imm_read or
imm_set). Although I like the imm_ idea, I would like to make sure we do
not break any existing imm_read or imm_set users.
But since I don't see any, I think it would make sense.
