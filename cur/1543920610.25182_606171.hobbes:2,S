Oops -- if you did, I lost a little context.  (However, what you say below
does give me a sense of deja vu ;-).)
Can you please check my notes below:

So I wrote:
   execve(2) semantics
       Just  like  any  other  file  descriptor, a signalfd file
       descriptor remains open across an  execve(2),  unless  it
       has  been  marked  for close-on-exec (see fcntl(2)).  Any
       signals  that  were  available  for  reading  before  the
       execve(2)  remain  available to the newly loaded program.
       (This is analogous to traditional signal semantics, where
       a  blocked  signal that is pending remains pending across
       an execve(2).)  (This is analogous to traditional  signal
       semantics, where a blocked signal that is pending remains
       pending across an execve(2).)
Okay?

So I wrote:
   Thread semantics
       The semantics of signalfd file descriptors  in  a  multi-
       threaded  program  mirror the standard semantics for sig-
       nals.  In other words, when a thread reads  from  a  sig-
       nalfd  file descriptor, it will read the signals that are
       directed to the thread itself and the  signals  that  are
       directed  to the process (i.e., the entire thread group).
       (A thread will not be  able  to  read  signals  that  are
       directed to other threads in the process.)
Okay?
Cheers,
Michael
