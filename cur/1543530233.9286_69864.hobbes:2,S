im running debian 2.2 with a 2.2.15-pre13 smp kernel. it runs on a tyan 1832dl
tiger 100 motherboard, 2 p3 500s and adaptec 2940uw controller. since i put
the dual procs in, my computer locks up when i real put a load on the
system (enocoding, compiling kernels, updating, etc.). also on boot up it
sometimes locks up around the scsi controller intialization.
from what i have read in the kernel mailing list archives, others running
older smp kernels on tyan motherboards have had similar problems. there were
supposedly patches released to fix these problems, but i have yet to find
them. 
anyway, was seeing if anyone else was having these problems or offer any
advice.
