Subject: submit_bh leaves interrupts on upon return

Any reason why submit_bh should turn on interrupts after being called by 
a process with ints off in 2.4.20?  I see it's possible to sleep during 
elevatoring, but why does it need to leave interrupts on if the calling 
state was with ints off.  
I'm back BTW.  Hope no one missed me.  I can be reached at the email 
address above.
