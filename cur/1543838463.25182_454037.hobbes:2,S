Looks pretty reasonable.

Could we give these some slightly more intuitive names?  INF is a bit
terse ;)
Since these #defines and function are also all in base.c, and not
referenced elsewhere, might it be reasonable to take some of the PROC_
headers off of them?  I know I've been frustrated more than once by
popping things like "oom_score" in to cscope and finding no definitions.
