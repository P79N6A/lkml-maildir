Devil's Advocate:
In that case, we should remove support for block sizes smaller than
a page because they suck for large-sized (and even medium sized)
files and we shouldn't allow people to use them.

Yes, like 512 byte block size filesystems using large directory
block sizes for dedicated mail servers. i.e. optimised for large
numbers of small files in each directory.

The common case is pretty good already for common case workloads.
What we need to do is provide options for workloads where tuning the
common case config is simply not sufficient. We already provide the
option to optimise for small file sizes, but we have no option to
optimise for large file sizes....
Cheers,
Dave.
