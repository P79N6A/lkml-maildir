I'm just trying to digest this a little.
As I understand your description for non-shared mappings the VMAs are
per process.
For shared mappings you share in some sense the page cache.
My gut feel says just keep a vma per process of the regions the
process has and do the appropriate book keeping and all will be fine.
For shm_nattach it looks like you simply are not calling the
open/close methods on fork (because you have a shared pool of vmas).
