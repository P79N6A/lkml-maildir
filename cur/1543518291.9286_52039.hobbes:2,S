My sound card also got broken from the latest changes to isapnp, and
sound blaster stuff in the kernel.  I have an old 16 bit sound blaster
card.  It works completey fine with 2.3.29.
I do have CONFIG_ISAPNP enabled in my kernel configuration.
running dmesg, all I see is:
Sound initialization started
Sound initialization complete
where as I used to get:
Sound initialization started
<Sound Blaster 16 (4.13)> at 0x220 irq 5 dma 1,5
<Sound Blaster 16> at 0x330 irq 5 dma 0
<Yamaha OPL3> at 0x388
Sound initialization complete
Hope this helps.  I looked through the code for where it generated that
string, but unfortunately I coudln't find it.  There were also a lot of
isapnp changes in drivers/sb_card.c.  So maybe that's the culprit.
If you need any more information, please contact me.  (cc me, as I'm not
on the list)
