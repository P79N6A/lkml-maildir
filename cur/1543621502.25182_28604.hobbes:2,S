Thanks for the fix, Rajasekhar.
I once encountered the same problem which may not
be unique to bonding though, and fixed it by simply
replacing INT_MAX with 2147483647. Both this method
and yours allows far more interfaces than anyone
would need, but at least your fix is cleaner in that
it guarantees that the parameters will really be
checked and not only rely on insmod.
Chad, I don't remember if I sent you my fix, but
I'd prefer this new one. Could you apply it
and/or send it to davem ?
Regards,
Willy
