Informix Dynamic Server is a free download from www.informix.com
(but its fairly big, ~30MB). I think Oracle is downloadable too.
With either the shm used is normally "large" with respect to
available physical memory (i.e. everything that isn't needed by
processes under your normal load) because the database engines
use it to cache data (this is why they want raw IO - there's no
point the OS caching the data as well).
