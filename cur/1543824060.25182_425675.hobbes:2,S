Well thats a half-arsed way to do it.  The kernel makefile could be
using the new /usr/local/sbin/depmod and the system the old
/sbin/depmod /sbin/insmod /sbin/modprobe etc.
Just install the new modutils to /usr/local/ and then add
/usr/local/sbin to your $PATH _before_  /sbin etc. so it is read
first.
