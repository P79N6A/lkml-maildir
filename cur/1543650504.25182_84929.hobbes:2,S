Some notes:
1) having so many encryption algorithms is a huge pain in the ass, and
   it will never be accepted into the kernel like that.  Pick some
   "good" encryption algorithms (like those that will be supported as
   part of IPSec and/or the encrypted loop devices: 3DES, AES, RC5 or
   whatever) and then there can be some re-use with other parts of the kernel.
2) "not requiring a loopback device" is in itself only a marginal
   benefit at best
3) It would probably be beneficial to add this as part of the ext2compr
   code, since it already handles per-file munging, and it is very common to
   do compression as a pre-processing step to encryption to reduce the
   redundancy in the input data
Cheers, Andreas
