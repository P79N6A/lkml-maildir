The 'shared' field in /proc/meminfo (source for 'top' and 'free') has
nothing to do with {SysV,POSIX} shared memory.  The 'shared' field
referred to memory that was used by more than one process (shared
libraries, shared text segments etc).  As I understand it, under 2.4
the 'shared' field is very expensive to calculate, so we don't--the
zero value is there to avoid breaking programs that parse
/proc/meminfo.
