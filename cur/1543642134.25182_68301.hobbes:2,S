Correct.  The solution, in the context of the linuxppc_2_4_devel tree,
is to do the following:
        Enable "Prompt for advanced kernel configuration options"
        Enable "High memory support"
        Enable "Set maximum low memory" and set to 0x40000000
        Enable "Set custom kernel base address" and set to 0xa0000000
Note that highmem support will not be used in his case (he didn't
want to use it), because PAGE_OFFSET is at 0xa0000000 and
MAX_LOW_MEM is at 1GB.  With this configuration, VMALLOC_START
will be at 0xe0000000 + VMALLOC_OFFSET leaving ample vmalloc
space for most applications.  All system memory is mapped as
lowmem .
