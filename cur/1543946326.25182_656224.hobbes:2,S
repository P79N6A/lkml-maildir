 Initramfs isn't something I've ever tried, so I'm not about to rush
into it on the server.  Maybe I'll try it on a desktop one day.
Anyway, I've now got it running without ide=reverse, details follow
for anybody else who gets a similar problem in the future.

 And for the next person asking this, it seems to be so that you
can specify the root= parameter.

 Turns out I was wrong about having a SATA disk for the system - I
used to, but then I needed to separate the backups into separate r/o
and r/w filesystems when nfs no longer let me export part of a ro fs
as rw.  In the change, my staging area for writing to tape or DVD
moved to the system disk, and the only big-enough disk I could get
locally was parallel ide.  So in that setup, ide on a card comes
first.

 My first thought was to try using libata for the drives on the
add-on card (sii0680), although it's marked as experimental.  Maybe
I picked the wrong driver, but they didn't show up.  Reverted to
previous config.
 Changed to mount-by-label so that I don't have to change fstab for
the old and new kernels.
 Moved the main drive and the CD to libata (sii still old IDE) -
specify sda instead of hda in root=, change system scripts referencing
drives by name (for SMART - system disk is again -d ata, the data raid
moved from hd{e,g} to hd{a,c}), now seems to be working but I expect
I'll notice a few things more in my scripts over the next days.
 I also discovered that lilo needed the real node specified in root=
to exist.  It complained, so I added a symlink to the hdaX node -
panic'd trying to load rootfs from 0307.  Reboot to old kernel, run mknod on /dev,
repeat, booted.
