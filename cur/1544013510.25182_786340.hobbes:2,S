Is there a good reason that these archs allow you enter arbitrary HZ 
values? The use case for using custom HZ values at all nowadays seems 
fairly low now that dynticks is around (if that arch supports it 
anyway), let alone being able to specify wierd obscure values for it. 
Especially if nothing can ensure that all values it allows will actually 
result in a functional kernel..
