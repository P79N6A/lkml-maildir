2.6.0-test3 and earlier provide only a very limited form of console on
a Siemens Primergy H450.
For example, pressing RET yields:
atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 0, scancode 0xed, on isa0060/serio0) pressed.          
So far, I only tested remotedly, using the built-in console
redirection support.  2.4.20 works like a charm (using remote console,
I think we never tested the local one).
