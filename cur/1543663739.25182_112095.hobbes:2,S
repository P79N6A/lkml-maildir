That hardly counts as reasonably performant: the slowest mainstream chips 
from Intel and AMD are clocked well over 1 GHz.  At least x86-64 will 
improve the performance of the 32 bit databases people have already 
invested large amounts of money in, and it will do so without the need 
for a massive outlay of funds for a new 64 bit license.  Why accept 
more than 10x the cost to migrate to ia64 when a new x86-64 will improve 
the speed of existing applications, and improve scalability with the 
transparent addition of a 64 bit kernel?
