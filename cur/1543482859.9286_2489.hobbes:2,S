Someone else reported that the `ldd core` bug is better, but still isn't fixed
on 2.2.0ac2.  I tried it myself, and it produced the same results the other
fellow got.  It didn't totally hose the system, and I was still able to login,
and Alt-SysRq worked, but commands did not execute properly, and I had to use
Alt-SysRq-b to reboot the system.  Let me know if I can supply more information.
