Nick,
The problem is corrected with this patch.  I am running with 3GB of 
kernel memory
and 1GB user space with the userspace splitting patch with very heavy 
swapping
and user space app activity and no failed allocations.  This patch 
should be rolled
into 2.6.9-rc2 since it fixes the problem.  With standard 3GB User/1GB 
kernel
address space, it also fixes the problems with X server running out of 
memory
and the apps crashing.
Jeff
Here's the stats from the test of the patch against 2.6.8-rc2 with the
