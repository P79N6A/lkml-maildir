BTW why not? Assuming shared interrupts:
IRQ cames,
my driver blocks interrupt and tells userspace
userspace notices it is not its interrupt and tells kernel
kernel unblocks and sends interrupt to next driver in chain
As long as you don't share interrupt with disk driver (or if you have
userspace driver pagelocked), there will not be deadlocks.
Of course it will be dog slow. It will introduce incredible
latencies. But it might even work.
