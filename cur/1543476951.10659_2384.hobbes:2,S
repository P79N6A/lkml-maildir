	Oh, yes. I've fixed some parts of this stuff, but it's still ugly.

Umm... Little addition: this function is used to allocate dentries for
sockets and pipes. IMHO they should have separate superblocks (maybe
one for each address family).

Addition: current code will break and burn if the target is unhashed. I've
rolled a patch for that (and for bunch of races in rename()) but looks
like Linus didn't apply it.
	Please, look at 
ftp://math.psu.edu/pub/viro/splitup.tar.gz
There sits the latest portion of patches I've done for VFS and
filesystems. I'm going to feed at least some of them to Linus before
2.2.0 final.
