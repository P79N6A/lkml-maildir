Nice point, not far-fetched, though I don't know whether it's worth
worrying about or not.  Yes, as things stand, the kernel will
needlessly write them out to swap: because we're in the habit of
marking a writable pte as dirty, partly to save the processor (how
i386-centric am I being?) from having to do that work just after,
partly because of some race too ancient for me to know anything
about - do_no_page (though not the function in question here) says:
	 * This silly early PAGE_DIRTY setting removes a race
	 * due to the bad i386 page protection. But it's valid
	 * for other architectures too.
Maybe Nick will decide to not to mark the readfaults as dirty.
