I don't think they make it clear *what* you are paying for. I think it 
is reasonable if they claim that you are paying for the distribution, 
NOT the license.
I am not trying to defend sveasoft. Personally, I dislike their method, 
but I'm gathering information to try and understand who's right, who's 
wrong and if sveasoft is indeed violating the GPL.

pedro venda.
