Ok, if it is that simple, why do we pass the filename rather than
/proc/fd/something in binfmt_script? I can't see that it would break
anything, apart from some user not careing about procfs-support
(which could be wrapped by an #ifdef though).
Expect a patch for this tomorrow. Btw. is this file-passing really
race-free? I.e. could we safely enable suid-bits for scripts with
/proc/fd passing?
Richard.
