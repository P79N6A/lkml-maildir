Due to stability problems with the RAID code in 2.4 (detaailed
message forthcoming), I would like to try 2.6.0 on one of our
servers. However, anticipating problems, I want to make sure that
this change is not irreversible.
Can I mount RAID 1 and 5 partitions in 2.6.0 and 2.4.24
interchangeably?
Thanks,
