*You're* the one with the proposal, *you* model it.  Do it with Linux, since
this is linux-kernel, not sunos-kernel.  Do it with several different
distributions of file sizes.  Everyone can do the maths, but sufficient people
have come up with sufficient potential problems to indicate that the way you
want to do the maths might not necessarily prove to be
effective/efficient/useful/winning in real life.
With the number of proposals that appear here and elsewhere, I'd say it's
impractical, unreasonable and a waste of collective effort for everybody to
model all the proposals.

This is hardly going to win people round to your point of view.
