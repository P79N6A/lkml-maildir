Sorry, but in this case you have got a lot more variables than you
seem to think.  The obvious lock is the ext2 superblock lock, but
there are side cases with quota and O_SYNC which are much less
commonly triggered.  That's not even starting to consider the other
dozens of filesystems in the kernel which have to be audited if we
change the locking requirements for GFP calls.
Cheers,
 Stephen
