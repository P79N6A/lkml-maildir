the main reason was that it was easier to convert everything (even old-BH
style code) that did deferred processing to workqueues than to tasklets -
since a fair chunk of deferred processing needs process context. Another
reason is that generally it's easier to handle overload situations if the
work is done in process contexts. But i agree, for things where it really
matters performance-wise, introducing a tasklet should be the next step.
