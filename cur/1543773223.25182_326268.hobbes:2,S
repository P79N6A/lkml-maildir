Agree.  We should encourage people to use bugzilla as the initial
entry-point.  But if someone instead uses email as the first contact I'm
just a little bit reluctant to say "thanks, now go and try again".
Perhaps we could find some nice volunteer (hint) who could take the task of
transferring such reports into bugzilla.  There wouldn't be very many, really.
