Just a wild guess here... Debian's (and I guess Ubuntu's) udev rules
contain a generator for persistent interface name rules. Maybe these
start working with 2.6.15 and thus the switch (ie. the kernel would call
it eth0, but udev renames it to eth1).
The generated rules are written to
/etc/udev/rules.d/z25_persistent-net.rules on Debian, not sure if its
the same for Ubuntu. Editing/removing the rules should fix your problem.
