Gad.  I guess if we're going to do this then a better implementation would
be to use test_and_set_bit(some_unsigned_long).  And perhaps call some
oom_kill.c interface function here rather than directly accessing
oom-killer data structures (could be an inlined function).
But the broader question is "what do we want to do here".
If we've picked a task and we've signalled it then the right thing to do
would appear to be just to block all tasks as they enter the oom-killer. 
Send them to sleep until the killed task actually exits.  But
a) memory can become free (or reclaimable) for other reasons, so those
   now-sleeping tasks shouldn't be sleeping any more (this is a minor
   problem).
b) one of the sleeping tasks may be holding a lock which prevents the
   killed task from reaching do_exit().  This is a showstopper.
But I think b) stops your show as well:
- task A enters the oom-killer, decides to kill task Z.
- task A holds a lock which is preventing task Z from exitting
- but oom_kill_lock is now held.  task A just keeps on trying to reclaim
  memory and trying (and failing) to kill tasks.
- user hits reset button.
IOW: we just have to keep killing more tasks until something happens.
