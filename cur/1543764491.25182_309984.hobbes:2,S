You should also check your database documentation if VARCHAR(n) is
actually implemented implemented in the same way as TEXT (or what the
unbounded string type is called), plus an additional length check.  It
doesn't make much sense to use VARCHAR if there isn't a performance
(or disk space) benefit, IMHO, especially for such data.
