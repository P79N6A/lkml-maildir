Subject: 2.3.47 Oops using cdrom

I was using 2.3.47 to read a cdrom, using cdda2wav. But the cd has alot
scratches, and it looks like it can't read it. I have tried it serveral
times, sometimes I had different error messages. The one that happend just
before the oops was:
Feb 26 21:09:40 Q kernel: scsi0 : channel 0 target 0 lun 0 request sense
failed, performing reset.
Feb 26 21:09:40 Q kernel: SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
Feb 26 21:09:40 Q kernel: SCSI error: host 0 id 0 lun 0 return code =
18000002
Feb 26 21:09:40 Q kernel: ^ISense class 0, sense error 0, extended sense 0
It was doing that showing those messages every second, and you couldn't do
anything.
I had that error before, and then just rebooted.
I wrote down the EIP from the oops: c011dc40
from System.map:
c011dc30 t count_active_tasks
c011dc60 T timer_bh
Other errors I saw with previous attempts to read it:

I had to reboot each time, because I couldn't do anything else.
I tried the same with 2.2.13, It stopped, and the system was still useable
after it.
The cdrom is an HP CD-writer+ 7100, on hdd, which is the only device on
ide1. I'm using scsi emulation.
With 2.2.13 I'm not using dma, with 2.3 I'm am. Have an ALI1533. No idea
if it has anything to do with it.
If you need more information, ask.
