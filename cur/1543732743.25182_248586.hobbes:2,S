I just set up the loopback interface via ZEBRA/OSPF as You described it 
and checked via tcpdump the source IP address of the related NFS packets.
The kernel chooses the IP address of the NIC he routes the packets over as
the source IP address and not the Source VIPA configured for loopback.  
You are right, it would be one option to have a "bind to address" in KNFSD.
But our idea was to implement a feature well known from other operating 
systems like AIX to Linux because this feature is quite popular and liked 
especially by large customers.  As You have read for sure such a feature
adding redundant functionality to the kernel is not desired. So maybe we
should continue our discussion privately. Thanks for Your suggestions!

We would win a facility allowing for a Source VIPA for all
kinds of servers not offering an explicit bind option. So: Due to the 
feature port idea mentioned above.

The enterprise customers we care about have for example servers
that utilize other servers (application servers utilizing a database or
a NFS server, etc.). So to generate replies these servers need
replies of other servers .

As mentioned above ;)

If we focus for a moment just on the NIC-fail-over issue (not caring 
about layers, virtual IPs, etc.) then bonding offers the desired failover with
some restriction. This is the reason why I mentioned it in this context.
Again, thanks for Your suggestions and maybe we should continue our 
discussion privately.
