Big-time.  There are a lot of "artificial" internal kernel memory
limits in the 32-bit architecture, so you can run up against those
(triggering the OOM killer) even if you have plenty of application
memory.
32GB in the box actually might be counter-productive unless you're
running 64-bit, because just tracking that much memory will consume
precious low kernel RAM.
