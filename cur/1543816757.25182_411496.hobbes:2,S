It is more than realistic. Hosting companies run more than 100 VPSs in 
reality. There are also other usefull scenarios. For example, I know the 
universities which run VPS for every faculty web site, for every 
department, mail server and so on. Why do you think they want to run 
only 5VMs on one machine? Much more!
Thanks,
