Subject: [PATCH 0/4 -v5] x86_64 EFI runtime service support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following patchset adds EFI/UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware
Interface) runtime services support to x86_64 architecture.
The patchset have been tested against 2.6.24-rc1 kernel on Intel
platforms with 64-bit EFI1.10 and UEFI2.0 firmware. Because the
duplicated code between efi_32.c and efi_64.c is removed, the patchset
is also tested on Intel platform with 32-bit EFI firmware.
v5:
- Remove the duplicated code between efi_32.c and efi_64.c.
- Rename lin2win<x> to efi_call<x>.
- Make EFI time runtime service default to off.
- Use different bootloader signature for EFI32 and EFI64, so that
  kernel can know whether underlaying EFI firmware is 64-bit or
  32-bit.
v4:
- EFI boot parameters are extended for 64-bit EFI in a 32-bit EFI
  compatible way.
- Add EFI runtime services document.
v3:
- Remove E820_RUNTIME_CODE, the EFI memory map is used to deal with
  EFI runtime code area.
- The method used to make EFI runtime code area executable is change:
  a. Before page allocation is usable, the PMD of direct mapping is
     changed temporarily before and after each EFI call.
  b. After page allocation is usable, change_page_attr_addr is used to
     change corresponding page attribute.
- Use fixmap to map EFI memory mapped IO memory area to make kexec
  workable.
- Add a kernel command line option "noefi" to make it possible to turn
  off EFI runtime services support.
- Function pointers are used for EFI time runtime service.
- EFI reboot runtime service is embedded into the framework of
  reboot_type.
- A kernel command line option "noefi_time" is added to make it
  possible to fall back to CMOS based implementation.
v2:
- The EFI callwrapper is re-implemented in assembler.
Best Regards,
Huang Ying
