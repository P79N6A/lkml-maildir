I don't think so. As the user sees it, a directory is mostly a convenient
labeled container for files. You think in terms of moving files around, not
destroying one and magically creating an exact copy elsewhere (even if
mv(1) does exactly this in some cases). Also, this breaks up the operation
"mv foo bar/baz" into _two_ changes, and this is wrong as the file loses
its revision history.
