The same thing is true of *any* gcc release.
For example, C++-ABI wise, 2.95.x is incompatible BOTH with egcs 1.1.x
_and_ the upcoming 3.0 release.

Not very actively.
Please take the time to compare the activity in gcc_2_95_branch with the
patches in the current "2.96" version in rawhide.

It will be incompatible with any non-2.95.x-version, and I don't think
2.96-68 is any more buggy than the current 2.95 branch.
The initial 2.96 "release" did have some odd bugs; all the known ones have
been fixed.

This may be good for the kernel, but it's not acceptable for C++.
Also, there's no support for some of the platforms we have to work with,
such as ia64 and S/390 - using different compilers for different
architectures isn't a real solution either.

Neither does 2.96-68.
