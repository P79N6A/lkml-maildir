thanks - thought it might be something to do with fragmentation, but i
wasn't aware of the <16mb restrictions on isa cards.
*but*, does this solution apply to kernel 2.0.36?  i see it in the docs
for 2.2, but not 2.0, and when i try adding
options sound dmabuf=1
in /etc/conf.modules under 2.0.36 and then modprobing sound.o i get:
/lib/modules/2.0.36/misc/sound.o: symbol for parameter dmabuf not found   
..unfortunately i've had some problems experimenting with 2.2 and don't
want to upgrade yet.  anything else i can do?  (or does anyone want to
come over and help me work the kinks out of 2.2 on my system? ;)
thanks...
