Maybe.  I really think the sane semantics are in a different uid namespace.
So you can't assumes uids are the same.  Otherwise you can't handle open
file descriptors or files passed through unix domain sockets.
A user namespace is fundamentally about breaking the assumption that
you can test to see if two users are the same by comparing uids.
If you don't want to break that assumption don't use a user namespace.
Mapping uids is a separate but related problem that we probably need to
tackle in a generic manner, usable for network filesystems.
