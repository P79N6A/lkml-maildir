Not sure that is a good idea. Sometimes this information is not available.
With pcibus_to_cpumask() the fallback is obvious, but it isn't with
pcibus_to_node(). Returning a random node is wrong.

It's impossible currently - I need an ACPI 3.0 BIOS to get this information.
Even then there will be machines who don't supply it.
I tried some time ago to get it from the hardware, but the hardware registers
were arcane enough that I didn't find it easy enough. Relying on firmware
for this thing is probably a better idea anyways.
