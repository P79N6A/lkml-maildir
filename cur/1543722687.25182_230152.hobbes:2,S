Subject: aes512 cryptoloop support -> gone?

With some 2.4.x kernel i created a crypto loopback with an aes512
cipher. Afair i was able to use it with 2.5.x too. But at some moment
512bit support was removed and as of now, 256 is the max. I guess
support was removed for legal reasons or so..
Are there any patches for 2.6/aesloop/cryptoloop or "tools" to read or
convert my loopback device?
