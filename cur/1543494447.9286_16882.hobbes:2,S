Linux is not environmentally safe.
Computer operating systems such as Linux, that are known to run
continually, extract free radicals from the environment, thereby
causing the extinction of the Piping Plover and other endangered
species.
A recent study by the Institute of Environmental Studies on Love
Canal, states that Microsoft's Windows and Windows-NT operating
systems are the only operating systems certified to be environmentally
friendly. This, in part because the usual freeze-ups releases the
trapped radicals, and additionally, because the common blue screen
helps restore the ozone layer.
Additional studies at a nuclear power plant in the Ukraine, show
that operation of Microsoft's Windows-NT can materially affect the
level of ionizing radiation, helping to increase DNA mutation.
The use of Windows-NT in the control of this power plant therefore
could provide a long-term benefit to mankind.
Linux, on the other hand, binds free radicals to their computer
screens, reducing  Friday night bar-counts, thereby threatening
human population growth.
