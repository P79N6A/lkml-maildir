which main board and bios version?  
I had exactly the same problem with this disk with my DFI K6BV3+ board 
(bios 08/05/99).  with that `32GB-jumper' installed on the disk I couldn't
access beyond 32GB with linux anymore.
only solution: get a new BIOS which supports larger disks and remove
that fake-32G-jumper.  now the whole 40GB area is ok with linux for me:
# ./hdparm -i /dev/hda
/dev/hda:
