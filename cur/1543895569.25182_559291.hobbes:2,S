I'm waiting for cereal boxes in the store to have a display covering the 
entire front side which changes every 30 seconds, with all the circuitry to 
drive it taking up a few square milimeters and a small watch battery to power 
it for six months ala the blinky LEDs of today.
This should be economicaly feasible in what, 10 years?  15?  (There are all 
sorts of weird problems to solve like coming up with a battery that's not 
only cheap enough but which you won't get in trouble putting millions of in 
landfills.  Fuel cell might be more environmentally friendly depending on 
your catalysts...)
We haven't even brushed against the "disposable computer era" compared to 
what's coming.  Most of us will probably live to see happy meal toys capable 
of running Linux, and that's just a _start_.
