I'm not sure how/why SELinux would want that information, as we would
just be labeling the key based on its creator (possibly via a transition
computation to allow derived types), and then later possibly support
explicit labeling by security-aware applications as permitted by policy.
Serial number wouldn't be used for access control, and audit is being
handled separately these days (e.g. one might introduce audit hooks to
collect the serial number at the right points for later inclusion in
audit records emitted at syscall exit).
