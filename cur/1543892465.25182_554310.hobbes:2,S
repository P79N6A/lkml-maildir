It works. I still have exceptions in dmesg (probably my dsdt doesn't
support _PTC and _TSS), but already I can read
/proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling:
maciek@rutek:~$ cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/throttling
state count:             8
active state:            T0
state available: T0 to T7
states:
   *T0:                  00%
    T1:                  12%
    T2:                  25%
    T3:                  37%
    T4:                  50%
    T5:                  62%
    T6:                  75%
    T7:                  87%
