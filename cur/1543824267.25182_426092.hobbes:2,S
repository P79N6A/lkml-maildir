Exactly, and since I cannot afford to buy one I'd have to build it
myself using mainly car batteries. The most complex part would be to
charge the batteries in a way that won't kill them over time. Building
such stuff into the PSU after the secondary coil and AC/DC converter
would save the double-conversion loss, therefore making this ideal for a
single machine. But I'm still brainstorming, lacking both money and
time.
Kind regards,
Chris
