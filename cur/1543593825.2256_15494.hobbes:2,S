Yeah, it does--I included support for the hwv control in the
docking patch.  I used a different technique though because I
couldn't get the technique used by Lukas's patch to work properly
for me.
I now have a patch that will output the hwv buttons pressed (up,
down, mute) to a new dynamically allocated misc device as letters
u, d, m, instead of directly modifying the mixer.  Anyone want
that?  It's more flexible than either the patch that's currently
in -ac or Lukas's patch, but you need a little userspace daemon
for it to do anything useful.
BTW, what is the officially approved way to open a device on a
dynamic misc minor?  Reading /proc/misc for the minor number,
then mknod'ing a device and opening it seems to me to have a
nasty race condition, am I missing something here?
