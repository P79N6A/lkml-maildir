Yes.  The other which made it into -mm via lkml is a more recent version
of the same patch (+documentation, +!x86 arch updates).
On the hvm_console.c changes: there is just a small change needed to
make it build on !ppc, that should be identical identical in my (xen)
and rusty (lguest) patch series.  Patching it only once is fine for
obvious reasons ;)
cheers,
