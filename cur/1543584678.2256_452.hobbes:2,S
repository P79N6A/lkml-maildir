Yes. But maybe "mount flags" is too narrow?
It is up to the filesystem what precisely it does.
What about
remount
        Attempt to remount an  already-mounted  file
        system.  This is commonly used to change the
        mount flags for a file system, especially to
        make  a  readonly  file system writeable. It
        does not change device or mount point.
