That particular issue has not happened to me.
I have had a similar problem in the past where, for example, after
cancelling a burn session with cdrecord I am unable to eject the disc.
However that was on kernel 2.2.x and using "real" scsi (not ide-scsi).
In the case of my original post, I am also not using ide-scsi, just
regular ide.
