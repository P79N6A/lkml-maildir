Interrupt disabled sigh.
Here is the fix:
SLUB: Fix numa bootstrap
NUMA bootstrap calls new_slab() if more than one node is found on bootup.
new_slab() assumes a standard slab context where interrupts must be
disabled. It enables interrupts for the call into the page allocator
and then disables them again. Interrupts do not have to be disabled
during on bootstrap because we still run single threaded there.
I dropped the interrupt preservation code just before SLUB v6 because
it looked useless there. SLUB worked on the following NUMA tests
that just had a single node. Sigh.
Enable interrupts after calling new_slab.
