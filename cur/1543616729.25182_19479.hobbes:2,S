I think one of the problems with this entire debate is lack of meaningful
numbers. Not for the first time, I propose that you test with something
that tests application benefits instead of internal numbers that may not
mean anything. For example, there is a simple test
		/* user code */
		get time.
		count = 200*3600; /* one hour */
		while(count--){
			read cycle timer
			clock_nanosleep(5 milliseconds)
			read cycle timer
			compute actual delay and difference from 5 milliseconds
			store the worst case
			}
		get time.
		printf("After one hour the worst deviation is %d clock ticks\n",worst);
		printf("This was supposed to take one hour and it took %d", compute_elapsed());

The theory that "fine grained = better" is not proved. It's obvious that
"fine grained = more time spent in the overhead of locking and unlocking locks and
		potentially more time spent in lock contention
		and lots more opportunities of cache ping-pong in real smp
		and much harder to debug"
But the performance gain that is supposed to balance that is often elusive.

Removing synchronization by removing contention 
is better engineering than fiddling about with synchronization
primitives, but it is much harder.
