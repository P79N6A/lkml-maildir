I doubt if we really need the timer running that early, apart from for
calibrate_delay().
You can probably move the time_init() and calibrate_delay() so they occur
after mem_init().  A close review would be needed to see if that is likely
to break anything.  If it is, then consider creating a new late_time_init()
thing, and call that and calibrate_delay() after mem_init().
