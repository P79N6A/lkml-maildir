Hi, I sent this once before but it seems to have gotten lost in the ether.
Any chance of applying the panic-on-oops patch to the mainline 2.4 tree?  It 
should be a simple patch apply, there are only a couple of extraneous lines 
that don't seem to be necessary (the "tainted" stuff, which seems to belong 
in another patch).
Thanks.
