How does it recognize cdroms?  Explicit list of majors?  Doesn't work for
IDE and I'm fairly sure that it doesn't catch all exotic ones.  Basically,
I don't believe that any methods based on keeping a registry of bad device
numbers are viable - if that information belongs anywhere, it's in drivers.
IMO the right way is to have driver set properties of gendisk and stuff
like partition-related devfs/driverfs code, RAID, evms, etc. to check
that.  _If_ we handle that stuff in the kernel, that is.
The question being, what property are you looking for?  "I'm suitable for
EVMS" is not an answer, obviously...
As for the loop...  At which point do you want to notice it?  Notice that
it can be opened earlier than anything could be read from it.
