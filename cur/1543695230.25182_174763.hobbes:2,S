I think I see what is going on here, but would something like this work out 
better?
	*imbalance = min(this_load - load_avg, load_avg - max_load)
That way you take just enough to either have busiest_queue or this_rq's length 
be the load_avg.  I suppose you could take even less, but IMO, the /=2 is 
what I really don't like.  Perhaps:
*imbalance = min(this_load - load_avg, load_avg - max_load);
*imbalance = (*imbalance + FPT - 1) / FPT;
This should work well for intranode balances, internode balances may need a 
little optimization, since the load_avg really does not really represent the 
load avg of the two nodes in question, just one cpu from one of them and all 
the cpus from another.
