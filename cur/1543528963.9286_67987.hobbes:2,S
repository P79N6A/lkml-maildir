This strikes me as a remarkable omission in
Documentation/kbuild/config-language.txt: it doesn't say much about
evaluation order (e.g. what happens when conflicting verbs meet, in
particular "unset" vs. anything else) or uniqueness requirements (e.g.
using multiple "define_bool"s is okay, while using multiple "bool"s
isn't).
Michael, could this omission be intentional ? :)
Evaluation order is a bit of a problem right now: xconfig and
menuconfig allow options to be probed before their definition, e.g.
you could (just as an example) show CONFIG_KMOD only if CONFIG_SCSI
is set. It works disturbingly well. As expected,  make config
silently treats such options as "n". I didn't try mconfig, but I
guess it probably detects all this and complains.
USB configuration looks like a candidate for the first misguided
attempt to use the non-sequential evaluation offered by xconfig and
menuconfig, because some USB devices depend on components configured
"below" USB, e.g. V4L.
Considering the sequential nature of  make (old)config , it seems
unlikely to me that anything other than strictly sequential
evaluation will be the norm anytime soon. This makes me wonder why
"unset" is considered a hack for a language problem in
config-language.txt (or did I mis-understand the comment there ?)
BTW, I think getting all configuration inter-dependencies properly
expressed in the various config.in files is a very worthwhile goal.
