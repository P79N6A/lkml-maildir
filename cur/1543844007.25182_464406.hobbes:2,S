We are filtering by means of "bogofilter", and we are training it
with all messages gone thru the list as "ham" -- but words that it
does not know are neutral to the statistics so entirely new kind
of message will easily receive "that is junk" treatment.
The rejection message does tell couple technical details, including
where to contact to ask advice.
