This is the lower 32-bit of the dma handle. The upper 32-bit is at the
following line of code:
	dst->table[i].addr_hi = 
				cpu_to_le32((sg_dma_address(src) >> 16) >> 16);

To make sure the content of request payload is valid before dma starting,
or at least no later than that. It might be unnecessary. But I don't know
if there is a systematic way to do it.

That's OK. Seems "static" is better.

OK. I guess here if we use ioremap_nocache() then the rmb() will be unneeded.
But it's ioremap() in the driver. So we can not safely remove the rmb() 
unless we change ioremap() to ioremap_nocache(), and do substantial testing
on it. It should be caching that caused the problem.
