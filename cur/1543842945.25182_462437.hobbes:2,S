How is it available for allocation?  I see it is in highmem but the
pmd's for the kva area are set with node local information.  I don't see
any special code to reclaim the kva area or extend ZONE_HIGHMEM.... How
does having the KVA area in ZONE_HIGHMEM allow you to reclaim it?
(sorry if this is an easy question but I an still sorting out how it is
"reclaimed" in the original implementation and why it can't be reclaimed
as part of ZONE_NORMAL).

Yea we know right where the initrd is at.  All this code is running
before the bootmem allocator is even setup in fact this function is
setting everything up to call setup_bootmem_allocator (at the end of the
function)... 
 Are you sure there isn't another way to reclaim these pages?

It is as easy as booting with an initrd :)  I can post some initrd
locations it a little while. 
Thanks,
