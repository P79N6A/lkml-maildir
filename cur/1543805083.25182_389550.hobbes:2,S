We cannot create an image that's greater than 1/2 of RAM (in general)
or 1/2 of lowmem (on i386) anyway, but this does not limit the size of
RAM of a box you want to suspend.  The rest of the RAM contents will
be swapped out before suspend.
Besides on x86-64 unsigned long is 64-bit, so it's not limited to 4 GB.
Greetings,
