   Where are interrupts disabled?   I just went through a set of kernprof 
   data and traced up the call graph.  In the most common __kfree_skb 
   case, I do not believe that it has interupts disabled.  I could be 
   wrong, but I didn't see it.
That's completely right.  interrupts should never be disabled when
__kfree_skb is executed.  It used to be possible when we allowed
it to be invoked from interrupt handlers, but that is illegal and
we have kfree_skb_irq which just reschedules the actual __kfree_skb
to a software interrupt.
So I agree with you, Mala's claims seem totally bogus and not well
founded at all.
