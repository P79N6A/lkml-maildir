Sigh. Read the quote to which I responded again. Not a word about
atomicity. Nowhere does it say that a descriptor which was ready for
reading at select() time is still readable at recvmsg() time. There is
no doubt that it would be very nice if select() would say something
useful, but that's not the issue here.

So document it.

Empty statement.

Obviously returning EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK while reading from a blocking
fd is not what we want (in the situation at hand). I don't see how it
relates to the discussion.

It doesn't.
