That would be nice, though the reason I avoided remap_page_range() in 
via82cxxx_audio is that it discourages S/G.  Because remap_page_range() 
is easier and more portable, several drivers allocate one-big-area and 
then create an S/G list describing individual portions of that area.
I want to avoid that.  Most decent h/w is s/g these days.
