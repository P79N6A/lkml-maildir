This kernel has all ide and scsi drivers built in (config attached)
I can do the complete serial boot thing if really necessary, but someboby 
might have an inkling from these details jotted down by hand:
__fdomain_16x0_detect+29
init_this_scsi_driver+94
(RIP __fdomain_16x0_detect+419)
Looks like the "Future Domain 16xx SCSI/AHA-2920A" scsi driver detect routine 
is doing something naughty.
This is a Tyan 2885 dual x86_64 running a 64bit generic x86_64 kernel. It 
doesn't have any scsi hardware.
In the meantime, I'm going to remove this driver from the .config
