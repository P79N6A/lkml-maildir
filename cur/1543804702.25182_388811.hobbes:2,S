Subject: [BUG] Timer subsystem broken for Pentium M / early XEON / P6 family

Hi everybody,
Have a look at the system log of a kernel compile on a Pentium M 750 system.
Speedstep is enabled, the kernel was booted with cpufreq.debug=2, the kernel
is configured to give timing informations on printks. Timer frequency is 
1000 Hz.
Kernel is 2.6.15-git7 + some changes unrelated to the timer subsystem.

Pentium 4 and Xeon model 3 and above increment the time stamp counter at 
a constant rate independent of the
current cpu frequency. Pentium M, Xeon up to model 2 and the P6 family 
increment with every internal processor
cycle. This behaviour is documented in chapter 18.8 of IA-32 Intel® 
Architecture Software Developer’s Manual,
Volume 3B: System Programming Guide, Part 2, Order Number: 253669-018, 
January 2006.
The timing information on printks should be monotone, it should be 
accurate, and it should be somewhat related to
the system time.
Obviously printk time jumps. But it is also inaccurate compared against 
system time: 10:33:18 is
1116 seconds after 10:14:42, and so the printk time at 10:33:18 should 
be 1260+1116==2376 and not 2362.
That means printk time lost 14 seconds against system time in less that 
20 Minutes.
Someone should have a close look at the code.

Knut
