My concern is that we need to make the implementation details simple. eg
so that simple things like "save state" can be done before we get into
"no this, no that , no the other" situations. Also so that for the many 
drivers where freezing the system once we have irqs off is easier (a lot
of sound for example is easiest done by disable irq, disable dma engine,
copy registers, return) can be done late and with small amounts of code
