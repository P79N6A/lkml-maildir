Well we first can agree that througout all processes/tasks of a container
the namespaces used are the same.
Hence looking at the init_task of each container is sufficient.
Restricting visibility to the default container makes sense to me,
because one is not supposed to be able to look into another container.
However, in the global context we do have pid that we can use.
