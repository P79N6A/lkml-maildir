Should we assume from $subject that namespace abuse is still occurring?
PARAM is way too generic, and while you may not like MODULE_PARAM or 
KPARAM or similar, I should hope it's self-evident that "param" i.e. 
"parameters" can apply to a great many things inside the kernel.
"PARAM" definitely does not suggest to the casual reader "kernel boot 
command line arguments, or, module arguments"
