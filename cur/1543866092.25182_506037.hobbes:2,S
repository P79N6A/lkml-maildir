I now understand that setting the MSG_TRUNC flag is only applicable for 
PF_PACKET. I do not argue about that any more. :-)
What I question is the return value when receiving from a local socket 
using recv(). Sorry, I don't know what the POSIX standard has to say 
about receiving from local sockets in contrast to UDP sockets as my only 
reference are the man pages.
According to "man 2 recv", on success the return value is the "the  number  
of bytes received". Since patch-2.6.8, UDP is always returning the full 
packet length. I'd like to see local sockets (PF_UNIX) to do the same. 
Does POSIX stipulate a different behaviour for local sockets?
Cheers
Daniel
