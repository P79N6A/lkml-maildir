Subject: Bug in ext3

I recently compiled support for ext3 into the kernel (2.4.15-pre4) and
booted that kernel onto a system that didn't have any ext3 partitions.
On boot I got these messages:
JBD: no valid journal superblock found
JBD: no valid journal superblock found
EXT3-fs: error loading journal.
This was when it mounted the root filesystem. After several minutes of
disk activity on /, I got this:
EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,20)): ext2_free_blocks: Freeing blocks not in datazone - block = 4294965248, count = 6872
Then it was mounted ro. Nothing happened to any of the other partitions
(including the 250gig RAID partition, just the root partition. I am
assuming that even though it was not an ext3 partition, that the ext3
driver took control of it. I tried fsck and remount,rw, but the problem
kept occuring (although with a different message about when removing a
file that the bit was already cleared).
Rebuilding without ext3 solves the symptoms, but of course not the real
problem.
