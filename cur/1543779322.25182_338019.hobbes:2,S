I believe he's talking about the future (he did said "will").  All the 
new AMD64 desktop chips have powersaving now, and Intel chips either 
have it now or will soon.  With the power that desktop chips draw 
nowadays (some are 80+ watts at idle), it is an important consideration. 
  As for uptake, a realistic number would be probably be 90% in three years.
Of course regardless of that I'd still like to keep the 1msec sleep 
resolution...
