I did find the NI site, but the $ scared me off, I'm trying to do this 
on the cheap since I'm mostly retired now.  I have a triple 8255 
board with 72 I/O lines from Futurlec.com coming now, with surface 
shipping, a hair over $70.  I don't believe the output is more than 
what the 8255 can sink by itself, no real buffering seems to be 
visible in the photo's on their wab page.  Its called the PCI8255.
The byterunner card might possibly be usable too but it didn't fall 
out of the search terms I used.  Bios wise, I'll find out when it 
gets here sometime this week.
Thanks Stephen.
