How do you want to handle the following?
<--  snip  -->
config FW_LOADER
      tristate "Hotplug firmware loading support"
      depends on HOTPLUG
config ATMEL
      tristate "Atmel at76c50x chipset  802.11b support"
      depends on NET_RADIO && EXPERIMENTAL
      select FW_LOADER
      select CRC32
<--  snip  -->
We've been biten that often by cases like a "select I2C_ALGOBIT" without 
a dependency on or a select of I2C and such cases are real issues that 
need a proper handling.
