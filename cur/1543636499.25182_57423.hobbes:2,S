I understand your point, and you are entirely right.
But it is a _completely_ unrelated issue.  The goal here is to not
overcommit memory and I think we succeeded.
An orthogonal issue is per-user resource limits and this may need to be
coupled with that.  It is not a problem I am trying to solve, however.
