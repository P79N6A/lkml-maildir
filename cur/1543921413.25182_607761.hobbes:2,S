Based on Linus' criteria, this appears to be a case for reverting the 
static LSM patch.
Jan, I remember you posting this last year and IIRC, there were really 
only coding style issues to be addressed.  There were some review queries 
and suggestions (e.g. decomposing CAP_SYS_ADMIN), but no deal-breakers -- 
certainly not now that security architecture and security model objections 
are out of bounds.
So, I would suggest reposting the code for upstream inclusion, which 
would be better at least in terms of upstream maintenance, as your code 
will be visible in the tree.
