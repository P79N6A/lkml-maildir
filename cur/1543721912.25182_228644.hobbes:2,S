          RX packets:26633293 errors:0 dropped:672 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:10031287 errors:132 dropped:3960 overruns:0
carrier:0
To my knowledge all those drops was yesterday during a 2 hour period..
This is a local switched lan with flowcontrol enabled.
Couldn't this be tx getting nuts due to delays that rx packets causes?
Thus:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit timed out
eth0: Transmit timed out, TxStatus 00 TxFrameId 14, resetting...
Anyways, something is wrong... but i assume it could be pci related:
  5:   43355556          XT-PIC  eth0
 10:   19987656          XT-PIC  aic7xxx, eth3
