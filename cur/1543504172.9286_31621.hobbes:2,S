it's completely unrelated to the hardware, i think. i tried 3 
different pcs (a dual pii w/ and w/o smp, an old p5 133 and
a pii 450). the result is always that you can read the cds
reliably with 2.0.36 and that 2.2.[9,10] is "forgetting"
some files (the exact numbers vary and seem to be somehow
system load dependent). 
but i've found something strange: the questionable cds do have 
screwed iso filesystems! there is a program called isovfy coming 
with mkisofs. this little prog lists some error msgs that i 
don't understand, for example:
-----------
[root@ompc3 diag]# ./isovfy /dev/scd1
Root at extent 14, 2048 bytes
[0 0]
15:  46    15    65536 *.      RRlen=12 [**BAD SUSP 0 0]
15:  80   220    29689   RRlen=32 [**BAD SUSP 0 0]
15:  80   432    24009   RRlen=32 [**BAD SUSP 0 0]
15:  80   64f    21379   RRlen=32 [**BAD SUSP 0 0]
15:  80   840    21219   RRlen=32 [**BAD SUSP 0 0]
15:  80   a57    20691   RRlen=32 [**BAD SUSP 0 0]
----------
why these errors are only showing under 2.2.[9,10], why
this happens silently without an error message and why
this is load dependent is still unclear to me.
