I must admit, that I don't know a whole lot about interrupt delivery.  
If we can avoid the private ISR ack then that would certainly be a good 
thing to do!  I think that would involve adding another bit to the 
virtqueues to indicate whether or not there is work to be handled.  It's 
really just moving the ISR to shared memory so that there's no plenty 
for accessing it.
