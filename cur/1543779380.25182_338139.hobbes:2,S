I was thinking of something like driver/bus into which
we might also be able to put the I2C and LL3 buses.
The only problem is that this might leave some parts
of the multi function chip homeless (if they can't
find a home in other subsystems).

Maybe, I haven't looked at pcmcia but the I2C
subsystem manages to avoid any arch dependent stuff so
couldn't we? I need to do more homework ;-), but
surely we only need a bus driver (IP block specific,
platform and arch independent), a core driver to
register busses and clients, and client drivers.

Yes, any function of a multi function device that can
live in a subsystem should do otherwise imagine the
mess, for example, with a chip that has a USB master
on it.
