Well profiling for user space developers. Certainly for embedded "soft
realtime" work I've found LTT really useful in understanding where the
contentions where in my user-space code. And also why the old pthread
mutex didn't work well with SCHED_RT priorities :-(
If it was my choice I'd like to see LTT merged, but of course its not
all about me much as I wish it was ;-)
