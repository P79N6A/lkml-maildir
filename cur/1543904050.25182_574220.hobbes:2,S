Subject: [PATCH RT] Fix RT balancing tasks pulling

  Hi Ingo, Thomas,
  this one-liner fixes a bug in balance_rt_tasks() which sometimes manifests by
having a lower prio task being scheduled while a higher prio task is sitting
waiting on another runqueue.
  This is pretty hard to reproduce on low cpu count machines, for example, I
had to have sched_football run in a loop for ~38h before it failed on a dual HT
Xeon box.
  Sébastien.

  In the CPU loop in balance_rt_tasks(), the 'next' task pointer is only ever
updated if this_rq->lock has been dropped in double_lock_balance().
  This sometimes lead to 'this_cpu' pulling tasks that are only garanteed to
have a higher priority than the 'next' picked before the loop.
  Fix this to update 'next' to the last picked RT task.
