I'll look at non-bulk once we have something useable by common folks
and Fedora ships ub, but not before. All my devices use Bulk. But also,
UFI has to come first. Only then, perhaps, I'll look at CB and CBI.

I don't have any plans for 8070 and 8020i. I promise to look at patches
if someone submits any. However, in my experience, 8070 devices are fickle.
They may be better off left to usb-storage forever, with its richer
infrastructure.
