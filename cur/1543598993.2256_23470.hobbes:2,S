You need to compile as a '386. Modify ../linux/.config to enable
CONFIG_M386=y under "Processor type and features". Delete all other
lines until "General Setup". Then execute:
	make oldconfig
Linux 2.4.1 boots fine on a '386. If that doesn't work, you may
have to back-rev your 'C' compiler.
I'm using egcs-2.91.66 which works okay. Some newer versions may
generate code that can't run on a `386.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
