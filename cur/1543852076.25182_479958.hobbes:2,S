The order in which disks are discovered, is basically
(1) what module (let's take the "core kernel" as a module too) is loaded 
    first (core kernel always comes first)
(2) running order of the __init functions in a specific module;
    running order mostly defined by linking order

>/dev/sdb   <--->  /dev/sdc

If you don't want udev, make an initramfs, build your disk driver as 
modules, and load them in the order you want your disks numbered.
udev or initramfs, you ought to choose at least one.
