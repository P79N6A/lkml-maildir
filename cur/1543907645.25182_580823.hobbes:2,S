That seems a particularly odd way to implement block I/O. Just use a
thread for this and the VMIN/VTIME functionality in the n_tty layer -
that is why it is there.

Almost all our drivers are not 16550A. A large part of the serial world
is now USB and current PCs (especially laptops) often don't include any
16550A devices at all.
Your changes seem to be - hardware specific, not supportable by many
devices, and designed to improve a particularly crazy way of handling the
I/O in the first place. That doesn't make a good candidate for the
upstream kernel.
