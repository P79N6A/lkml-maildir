To nitpick.
For a 10 bit long word, if the receiver syncs to within 1/8th of  the 
middle of a bit-time at the start, you've got 2/8th of a bit-time of 
disagreement possible, before you are likely to get errors, especially 
on limited slew-rate signals. (more modern chips will likely sample faster)
Or 3/80, or 2.5%. If the other side has made a similar calculation, then 
you should only really rely on 1%.
5% is the best possible case - that will in most circumstances cause errors.
