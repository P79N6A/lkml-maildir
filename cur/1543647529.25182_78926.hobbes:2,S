Hi Folks,
I've got Compaq Armada M700 laptop here. Keyboard and mouse(touch point 
actually)
are acting pretty strange with latest BK 2.5. I tried 2.5.40 and 41, 
results are
the same. 2.4.x has absolutely no problems.
Basically, mouse doesn't move at all, both with X and gpm. And keyboard 
generates
completely wrong codes. I press 'Ctrl' and get 't' instead, 'Alt' -> 'w', etc
most of the alpha keys generate total crap (non printable).
Here is what dmesg has to say about input devices
register interface 'mouse' with class 'input
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
i8042.c: Detected active multiplexing controller, rev-15.0.
serio: i8042  port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 AUX1 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
serio: i8042 AUX2 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12

input: AT Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
And sometimes I get this

atkbd.c: Unknown key (set 2, scancode 0x18, on isa0060/serio0) released.
