Subject: build problems on architectures where FIXADDR_* stuff is not constant

Hello!
   Since there are architectures where FIXADDR_* stuff is not constant (e.g. UML),
   I propose this patch that allows such architectures to build. (now compilation
   dies with complaints about using not constant value as struct initialiser).
   Here is my proposed patch, or may be there is a better way?
   This is against latest 2.5 bk tree.
Bye,
    Oleg

#   Well, not everyone have these FIXADDR_* as constants. UML have those as computed value.
#   So we need to assign those not in struct initializer.
