No.
There is no "window". The page_launder() logic is very clear - it will
write out any dirty pages that it finds that are "old".

So? We need to write them out at some point anyway. Isn't it much better
to be graceful about it, and allow the writeout to happen in the
background. The way things _used_ to work, we'd delay the write-out until
we REALLY had to, which is great for dbench, but is really horrible for
any normal load.
Think about it - do you really want the system to actively try to reach
the point where it has no "regular" pages left, and has to start writing
stuff out (and wait for them synchronously) in order to free up memory? I
strongly feel that the old code was really really wrong - it may have been
wonderful for throughput, but it had non-repeatable behaviour, and easily
caused the inactive_dirty list to fill up with dirty pages because it
unfairly penalized clean pages.
You do need to realize that dbench is a really bad benchmark, and should
not be used as a way to tweak the algorithms.

The new code has no difference between "full scan" and "partial scan". It
will do the same thing regardless of whether you scan the whole list, as
it doesn't have any state.
This did NOT happen with the old "launder_loop" state thing, but I think
you agreed that that code was unreliable and flaky, and caused basically
random non-LRU behaviour that depended on subtle effects in (a) who called
it and (b) what the layout of the inactive_dirty list was.

Well, more importantly, do you actually have good reason to believe that
it is wrong to try to write things out asynchronously?
