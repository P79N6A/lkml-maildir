What else is broken about this design.  Let me count the ways...
1)  What about group access to files?
2)  It means that you can't do a filesystem consistency check without
knowing all of the keys, since the block pointers in the inode would
also be encrypted.
3) If user1 has previously accessed the file, the encrypted inode
information will already be cached, and visible when user2 accesses
the file; stat() doesn't result in a call into filesystem code if the
information is already cached.  
What's the point of encrypting the inode?  What problem are you trying
to solve?
As to why you're having problems:
"ext2-fs error (device fd(2,0)): ext2_check_page: bad entry in directory #2:
unaligned directory entry - offset=0, inode=2, rec_len=46, name_len=0"
46 is ascii for '.'.  You missed a spot in mke2fs where you changed
the directory entry structure.  Specifically, in libext2fs, and note
that some portions of the ext2fs library which still use
ext2_dir_entry as well as ext2_dir_entry_2, for historical / ABI
backwards compatibility reasons.
