Errm, IBM is gambling with _their_ money, as are others such as HP,
and they're making big iron.
So do you believe they're all just completely stupid, and unable to read
their own sales figures? Or is it just a vast conspiracy to promote large 
SMP / NUMA boxes because of ... something?
Sun is not loosing money because they're "server based". It's because
they're locked into Solaris and SPARC, and customers by and large 
don't want that. Their machines are probably rather overpriced vs using
ia32 hardware as well. Your 1 dimensional extension of logic is ... 
unimpressive.
