Looks like this loop:
		....
                        while (voffset >= sg_dma_len(vsg)) {
                                voffset -= sg_dma_len(vsg);
                                vsg++;
                        }
		....
and in particular, it's the "sg_dma_len()" access that oopses, apparently 
because vsg was stale to begin with, or because it incremented past the 
last pointer.
The pointer that fails (0xc4bea00c) looks reasonable, so it's almost
certainly due to CONFIG_PAGE_DEBUG showing some kind of use-after-free
problem (ie the pointer is stale, and the memory has already been freed).
I suspect the problem is that 
	"voffset >= sg_dma_len(vsg)"
test: if "voffset" is _exactly_ the same as sg_dma_len(), then we will 
test one more iteration (when "voffset" is 0), and that iteration may be 
past the end of the "vsg" array.
I suspect the fix might be to change the test to
	"voffset && voffset >= sg_dma_len(vsg)"
to make sure that we never access vsg past the end of the array.
