ieee1394 + sbp2 has been irking me for a while, and I finally am
getting around to posting about it.
Using a fresh 2.6.7 on my powerbook G4 I plugged in my external
firewire drive(in a conversion kit) and insmod'd the sbp2 module(this
produced an error message like 'Trap set' or something I didn't write
it down).  The kernel spits out:
Jun 16 22:54:12 [kernel] ieee1394: got invalid ack 252 from node 65473
(tcode 4)

It doesn't init the scsi device /dev/sda nor does it let me remove the
module.  When I attempt to remove the module it says the module is in
use.  Finally I attempt to unplug the drive I had a hard system
hang(this is not suprising).
Any idea what's going on ? I could actually use it under 2.4, but 2.6
I haven't had any luck.
