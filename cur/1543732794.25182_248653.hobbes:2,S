Subject: EXT3: problem with copy_from_user inside a transaction

Hi Andrew,
filemap_copy_from_user() between prepare_write() and commit_write()
appears to be a problem for ext3.
prepare_write() starts a transaction, and if filemap_copy_from_user() causes
a page fault, we'll have
 - order violation with mmap_sem taken inside a transaction (possible
   deadlocks),
 - __GFP_FS memory allocation with all re-entrancy problems (e.g.,
   current->journal_info corruption).
Am I missing something?
If this observation is correct, the possible solution is to call
get_user_pages() or somehow pin the user pages before prepare_write(),
although it will hurt performance...
	Andrey
