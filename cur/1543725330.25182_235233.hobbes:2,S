The boot option may be useful, but in the core of the patch looks
like like a roundabout way to do things. Why don't you trigger
the meat of the quirk from, say, a DMI scan?

This looks like a bizzare place to use as a hook. The x400 and x445
obviously have their own bridges with own IDs (their NUMA cannot
be using Intel parts, right?). So why don't hook off that?
IIRC, we don't have 7 level of initcalls in 2.4, so perhaps you
need that particular hook location. But it just looks wrong.
The routines to take ownership look sane from USB HC access
(not sane from C programming standpoint, as I mentioned above).
But in any case, it's not something I can decide. Marcelo has that
power for stock kernels, and for Red Hat kernels there's a process
which starts with Bugzilla.
