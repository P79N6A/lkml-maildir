I have one of these, and have also seen intermittent problems. Here's what
I do to get reasonably reliable backups: 
  1. Run 2.2.2.
  2. Use SCSI-IDE emulation and the SCSI tape driver.
  3. Reboot the machine every day in a cron job and do the backup
immediately after reboot. 
I'm not sure that 2. is strictly necessary, as I've had more or less
analogous problems with both the native ide-tape driver and the scsi-ide
emulation. 3. seems to be the key for me: whatever the problem is,
rebooting seems to help.
Anyway, it seems to work: I haven't had a failed backup or a locked
machine in over a week.
