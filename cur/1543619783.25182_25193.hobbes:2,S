i'm using linux  2.5.3-dj1 (with driverfs) on a hp omnibook 6100.
After booting the system the alternative keyboard input mode is enabled.
I've got to enable and disable it manually to use the keyboard.
I've also got the USB - OOPS at system shutdown (compiled as kernel module,
only occurs sometimes...)
TIA
