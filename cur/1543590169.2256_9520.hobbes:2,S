I already have a patch from Ghozlane Toumi in my inbox that supports:
make randconfig
  answers randomly to the questions .
make allyes
  answers 'yes' to all questions .
make allno
  answers 'no' to all questions .
make allmod
  answer 'm' if avaiable, 'yes' else .
Plus you can specify defaults in .force_default which will always be
honoured.  I have been using it to stress test the 2.4.4 configs and my
2.5 makefile rewrite, it works very nicely.
