One is a P233 32MB and the other is a P100 24MB.  We do 
run *alot* of different things on it and the load has
grown substantially since the switch from 2.2.14.  For
example one of the web developers did a webmail which uses
php-mysql so we have apache-ssl's and mysqld's sitting
there, then there is the guy who likes jserv, then the 
mailserver (around 2000 a day) etc. etc.

OK, will do.  Just booted the new patched kernel about 
five minutes ago so should know before the end of the 
weekend if that does it.  
Thanks much.  :)
