Our kernel was also generated with CONFIG_PCI_USE_VECTOR enabled.
And according to a previuos mail by Mikael Petterson the value
60 related to sending and receiving vectors.
The problem only arises in one of our servers, the only one
with an Intel E7505 chipset. Is this related or pure coincidence?
