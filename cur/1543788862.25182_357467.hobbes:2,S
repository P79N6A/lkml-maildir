Indeed.
I suspect that the behaviour Chuck saw is (a) only present under 
contention and (b) very much dependent on other timing issues.
(a) is the wrong thing to optimize for, and (b) means that Chuck's numbers 
aren't reliable anyway (as shown by the fact that things like instruction 
alignment matters, and by Eric's numbers on other machines).
We want the spinlocks to behave well when they are _not_ under heavy 
contention. If a spinlock gets so much contention that it starts having 
these kinds of issues, then there's something wrong at higher levels, and 
the fix is to use a different algorithm, or use a different kind of lock.
Spinlocks by definition are the _simplest_ locks there are. Not the 
smartest or most fair. Trying to make them anything else is kind of 
missing the whole point of them.
