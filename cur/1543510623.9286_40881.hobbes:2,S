This will only work if you have a way of forcing people to update the
documentation when they change the code. People will modify other
peoples' code, sometimes they know what they are doing, sometimes they
don't.
These man pages (or whatever else) will get outdated, and there is no
way to enforce that they are updated. This is a free software project,
you can't just fire people for being too lazy to write
documentation. That said, we already have some documentation on
important things in Documentation, feel free to update it.
