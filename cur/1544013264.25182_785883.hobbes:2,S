having things outside of the embedded menu depend on embedded makes it 
hard for people to figure out what they need to do to disable specific 
things.
namespaces are also required if ! embedded, but namespaces are not (yet at 
least) something that is commonly used.
if you follow the logic you are providing to it's logical conclusion you 
may as well put all kernel config options under "I really know what I'm 
doing" top level lockout
