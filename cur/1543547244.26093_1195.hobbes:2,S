As also does anyone who does solaris drivers (x86 or sparc) using gcc- the
code that gcc emits that requires 64 bit operations is quite nicely available
in libgcc.a. Only a minor bit of hackage with gcc -v is needed in a makefile
to emit the correct path for the linker to use.
That is, unless somebody wants to write the support functions (specific to
gcc, ah, but which one?) into the linux kernel? Oh dear, I don't think so..
