side note, you should use atomic bitflag operations here or you risk to
lose a bit set by another cpu between the read and the write. you
basically meant SetPageDirty() if writepage fails. That is supposed to
happen in the lowlevel layer (like in fail_writepage) but the problem
here is that this isn't ramfs, and block_write_full_page could left
locked in ram lots of pages if it would disallow these pages to be
discared from the vm.

as said this cannot be fixed easily in kernel, or it would be trivial to
lockup a machine by filling the fs changing the i_size of a file and by
marking all ram in the machine dirty in the hole, the vm must be allowed
to discard those pages and invaliding those posted writes. At least
until a true solution will be available you should change vmware to
preallocate the file, then it will work fine because you will catch the
ENOSPC error during the preallocation. If you work on shmfs that will be
very quick indeed.
