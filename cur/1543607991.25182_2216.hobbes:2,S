What kind of system is this?
Can you reproduce this on older kernels?  With the aic7xxx_old driver?
With older versions of the "new" aic7xxx driver?
Since you are seeing "strange things" on two different controller types
this smells like random memory corruption.  With some experimentation
with different kernel and driver versions, you might expose a pattern
that helps track down what is going on.
