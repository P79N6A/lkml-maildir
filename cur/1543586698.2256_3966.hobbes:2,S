Exactly it made it a good option, and more important this heuristic can
only improve performance if compared to the mainline scheduler.
Infact I tried to reschedule the task back to its original node and it dropped
performance, anyways I cannot say to have done an extensive research on that, I
believe if we take care of some more history of the node migration we may
understand it's right time to push it back to its original node but that was
not obvious and I wanted a simple solution to boost the performance under CPU
bound load to start with.
