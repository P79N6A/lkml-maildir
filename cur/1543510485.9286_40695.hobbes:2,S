I will not be of much help but i felt it worth saying.
Both 2.2.11 and 12 lockup here, booting no problem startx no problem
using x no problem, closeing x no problem, once back into console
mode, the machine is unuseable, its just locked, reset is the only
way out. Both kernel versions have the same .config. (Available on
request).
