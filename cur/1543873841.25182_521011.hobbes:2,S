Hmm.  I guess what I have seen it that it was simply  more difficult
because there were fewer opportunities the bigger the branching factor
but I haven't looked at it very closely.

Agreed, currently the plan it to add an namespace parameter to hash table
compares during lookups.  Allocating hash tables at run time is almost
impossible  to do reliably because of the multiple page allocations.

Yes.  But I have given it a life of it's own as well.  Which means instead
of caching a pid_t value in a long lived data structure we can hold 
a struct pid *.  So that means we have fewer total hash table look
ups.

When I did a quick survey of systems I could easily find everything
was much lower than.  I wasn't been able to find those setups in my
quick survey.  I was looking for systems with long hash chains to
justify a data structure switch especially systems that needed to
push up the default pid limit, but I didn't encounter them.
So that said to me the common case was well handled by the current
setup.  Especially where even at 10000 we only have normal hash chain
lengths of 3 to 4 (3 to 5?).  I did a little modeling and our hash
function was good enough that it generally gave a good distribution of
pid values across the buckets.
My memory is something like the really nasty cases only occur when
we start pushing /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max above it's default at 32768.
Our worst case has pid hash chains of 1k entries which clearly sucks.

Agreed.  Hmm.  I didn't say that too well, I was thinking of the lack
of comparisons implying fewer cache line touches.

Partially sounds correct.  I had to replace it recently because it
was possible for readdir to skip a process that existed for the entire
length of an opendir, readdir_loop, closedir session.  It took a
process exiting to trigger it so it was rare but the semantics were
impossible for user space to work around.
The problem is if the process we stop on disappears things must be
well ordered enough that we can find the next succeeding process.
The previous code (which I assume Manfred did from skimming the
changelog) would simply count forward in a fixed number of processes
in the process list (when the process it had stop on died).  Which
since we always append to the end would of the task list would skip
processes immediately after those that had exited.

No.  If someone else is interested and can do the work I don't want
to reserve it for myself.
As long as I get to help review the changes I don't have any real
preferences for data structures as long it meets the needs of the pid
lookup.
I should mention there is also a subtle issue at the leaf nodes.  The
pid namespaces will be hierarchical with parents fully containing
their children.  Each struct pid will appear in it's current pid
namespace and all parent pid namespaces (or else we can't use
traditional unix process control functions (like kill, wait, and
ptrace)).  Each struct pid will be assigned a different pid_t value in
each pid namespace.
When we want the pid value of a process that isn't current there will
be a function pid_nr() that looks at our current pid namespace and
finds the pid_t value that corresponds to that pid namespace.
In general I don't expect the hierarchy of pid namespaces to be very
deep 1 for the traditional case and when we are actually taking
advantage of the pid namespaces 2 or 3, and so we might be able to
optimize taking that into account as long as the interfaces don't have
that assumption.  That observation does mean pid_nr can easily be a
walk through all of the possibilities. 
The implication there is that we might end up with:
struct pid_lookup_entry {
       pid_t nr;
       struct list_head lookup_list;
       struct pid_namespace *ns;
       struct pid *pid;
       struct list_head pid_list;
};
struct pid
{
	atomic_t count;
        struct list_head pid_list;
	/* lists of tasks that use this pid */
	struct hlist_head tasks[PIDTYPE_MAX];
	struct rcu_head rcu;
};
Alternatively it might just be:
struct pid
{
	atomic_t count;
	/* lists of tasks that use this pid */
	struct hlist_head tasks[PIDTYPE_MAX];
	struct rcu_head rcu;
        struct {
        	struct pid_namespace *ns;
                pid_t nr;
        } pids[PID_MAX_DEPTH];
};
There are a lot of variations on that theme and it really depends
on the upper level data structures which one we pick.
