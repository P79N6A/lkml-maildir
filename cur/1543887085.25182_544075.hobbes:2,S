I've noticed a few problems with this patch series, which I manually (without 
difficulty) ported to 2.6.22-rc1.
Firstly, the output of /proc/interrupts looks a bit strange. NO_HZ isn't 
enabled, just high resolution timers. HZ was set to 1000.
alistair@damocles:~$ cat /proc/interrupts

Only 195 timer interrupts? I only see this on an AMD Opteron, it doesn't occur 
on an Intel Core 2 Duo. Mainline reports this counter regularly increasing 
with or without the acpi_pm clocksource loaded.
Secondly, /proc/cpuinfo seems to be broken:
alistair@damocles:~$ cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep MHz
cpu MHz         : 210779.550
cpu MHz         : 210779.550
Unless my CPU is just under 80 times faster than it used to be, these numbers 
are incorrect. I expect 2700.50, or something similar. cpufreq isn't compiled 
in.
Finally, and possibly related, the dmesg timestamps seem to be totally broken. 
Apparently my machine booted in less than 1 second, with the last messages 
as:
[    0.607862] bridge: topology change detected, propagating
[    0.607862] bridge: port 2(lan-sky) entering forwarding state
[    0.830472] Linux agpgart interface v0.102 (c) Dave Jones
Of course, all of these problems might be PEBKAC, but I'm sceptical.
Find the kernel config, updated patch (for 2.6.22-rc1), dmesg, contents 
of /proc/interrupts and /proc/cpuinfo here:
