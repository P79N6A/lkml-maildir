If the intention was to help the gcc optimizing the code, that was not
readable from the old version. It also wasn't that clear that wakewrite
and sem->activity basically have the same information (only if one reads
the code carefully one sees that "wakewrite" actually means "only if
there's no activity, wake a writer").
