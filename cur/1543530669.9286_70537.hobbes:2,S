Subject: Deadly crash with 2.3.99pre1

There was a problem with the patch to 2.3.99-pre1 over 2.3.51
which gave a few error messages during the patch. I tried to compile
anyway and got some errors as the previous messages obviously had a meaning.
I downloaded the whole kernel. Compiling and rebooting went smoothly.
For test I ran wvdial, wavplay fword.wav and lpr -Praw README in
parallel in different consoles.
My ISP has some problems with a few modems so when wvdial connects at
slow speeds like 300, 9600 or anything else lower than 45k I give a ctrl C
and reconnect. The system crashed after a couple of ctrl C on wvdial.
I've never encountered this particular problem with any other kernel.
The printout went on smoothly until finished despite the crash. The
fword.wav file stop playing though and the keyboard no longer responded.
Since the printer was still working perhaps the printer changes are the
cause. I did have to patch the kernel 2.3.51 to get it to compile as some
subroutine was missing.
Linux distribution is SuSE 6.3 (I also have on the PC Slackware 7.0
Mandrake 7.02 and Corel Linux as well as winblows 98, OS/2 and DRDOS)
I have a cyrix 200Mhz with 40Meg of ram. Video card is SVirge + voodoo 2.
I have an AWE64 sound card and a logitech (with wheel) mouse.

I got the reboot messages after that. A hardware reset was necessary.
P.S. Any idea why there is no support for voodoo 2 and just voodoo 3?
