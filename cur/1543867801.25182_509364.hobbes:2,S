Great.. The reason why Greg KH, the guy who wrote the bit of code that
vj claims he wants to link to but can't, chose the GPL for *his* code
is clearly not the same as the reason why Linux chose the GPL.
Exactly what that reason is, will be best left to Greg to say, but I'm
pretty sure it has to do with what you call "marketing fluff" and the
rest of us call the moral imperative.
