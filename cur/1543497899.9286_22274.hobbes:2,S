	Yes, so ?  For quite a while so called "Super Scalar" tricks
	in "IPIC" (Implicitely ..) are delivering multiple instructions
	per single clock cycle.   EPIC in itself does not give you
	anything special, likely it will cause more constraints to
	the COMPILER, e.g. results of some calculation must be used
	only after given delay of so and so many instructions so that
	they arrive thru the computing pipeline back into registers.
	(Because e.g. 6 step pipeline would mean terrible delays and
	 computing inefficiency, things can't be done quite that way,
	 which means that Merced will need all possible tricks out of
	 the books, including register renaming, shadowing, etc, which
	 are now in use in high-performance RISC processors including
	 Alphas, MIPSes, and UltraSPARCs. (PowerPC also, very likely.))
	Super Scalar IPICs are now doing 3 to 6 instructions per clock
	cycle.  If Merced is to be even comparable, it can't do it with
	two instructions per instruction word.
	At the DSP world there have been EPIC style instruction sets
	around for at least 10 years.  Single instructions can do
	Multiply-Accumulate + two memory to register moves + address
	register calculations for each memory pointer registers.
	(Agreeably that case is rather special one, but anyway..)
	In research community things known as VLIW (Very Long Instruction
	Word) are known for quite a while, but aside of learning new
	things at the compiler writing (which does benefit both EPIC
	and Super Scalar IPIC processors), they haven't been commercial
	successes.

	There is an effort of porting Linux to Merced underway, but
	to learn any salient details of it, you have to sign NDA.
	(Until the Merced is published.)

	Processor instruction set encoding style is not a technique
	in kernel sense.
