Unless I'm very much mistaken, I've hit a bad problem with save_flags and
restore_flags on x86 with --fomit-frame-pointer.  I've been fixing a
few more races in 2.2.15-pre/drivers/char, and found the following code
being generated for n_tty.c (my hacked version):
    1ad3:       9c                      pushf  
    1ad4:       8f 44 24 14             popl   0x14(%esp,1)       <=== !!!
    1ad8:       fa                      cli    
    1ad9:       8b 97 c0 09 00 00       mov    0x9c0(%edi),%edx
    1adf:       89 54 24 18             mov    %edx,0x18(%esp,1)
    1ae3:       39 f2                   cmp    %esi,%edx
    1ae5:       75 94                   jne    1a7b <read_chan+0x4d9>
    1ae7:       29 cb                   sub    %ecx,%ebx
    1ae9:       89 d0                   mov    %edx,%eax
    1aeb:       01 d8                   add    %ebx,%eax
    1aed:       25 ff 0f 00 00          and    $0xfff,%eax
    1af2:       89 87 c0 09 00 00       mov    %eax,0x9c0(%edi)
    1af8:       ff 74 24 14             pushl  0x14(%esp,1)
    1afc:       9d                      popf   
You can't use the "g" constraint on any asm that messes with the
stack, and will be compiled with --fomit-frame-pointer.  If gcc runs out
of hardware regs, it spills to a stack slot, but doesn't know that the asm
has changed %esp.  In the above gcc should be using "popl 0x18(%esp)"
Simple fix: Change the "g" to "r".
