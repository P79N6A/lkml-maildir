Hi,
I have a RedHat 5.1 Linux with Kernel 2.0.36 running.
Linux locked up two times, the first time was about
2 month ago and the second one today. On the console
I got repeatingly the error message:
Aiee: scheduling in interrupt 00112345
What is meant by this error message? And what may
be the reason. 
The only thing worked was power off an on.
It is a productive machine, running about 13 hours
a day. There are normal Daemons running like:
ftp, www, samba and the isdn-subsystem for dialing
to the internet. Also there is a QIC-80 Streamer
for backup running whith ftape.
Many Thanks
Regards
Oliver
