An argoument in favour of the "void *" would be that there might be 
situations were a little structure needs to be passed, that will be copied 
by the target of the wakeup (callback) in its own data structure. But as 
you said, we already do "unsigned long" -> "pointer" conversions inside 
the kernel, so it does not really matter. Let's stick with the unsigned 
long version then.
