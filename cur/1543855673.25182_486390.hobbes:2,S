Firstly, the fix for 22278 is included in gcc 4.1.0.
Secondly, I believe that this is a separate problem from bug 22278.
hpet_readl() is correctly using volatile internally, but its result is
being assigned to a pair of normal integers (not declared as volatile).
In the context of wait_hpet_tick, all the variables are unqualified so
gcc is allowed to optimize the comparison away.
The same problem may exist in other parts of arch/i386/kernel/time_hpet.c,
where the return value from hpet_readl() is assigned to a normal
variable.  Nothing in the C standard says that those unqualified
variables should be magically treated as volatile, just because the
original code that extracted the value used volatile.  IOW, time_hpet.c
needs to declare any variables that hold the result of hpet_readl() as
being volatile variables.
