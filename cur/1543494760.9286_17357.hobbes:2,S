	I'm hammering a Linux machine by placing a high volume
(1,000,000 hits/day, 500,000 CGI hits/day) web site on it.  The box can
certainly handle the traffic -- it's a dual Pentium II-400 machine running
on a network with plenty of bandwidth.  Yet it dies constantly.  I'll
provide as much information as I can in case someone can help point me in
the right direction.
Kernel: 2.2.6 with SMP
Memory: 128MB
Disks: 9Gig local, 12Gig remote NFS from Irix 6.5.2 and locking on.
knfsd: 981204-1
	The machine dies so hard that the screen goes black and does
NOTHING.  Nothing on the screen, no keyboard input is accepted, no network
access is accepted.  When we recycle the machine, it usually won't restart
because of file corruption and we need to get someone to the box and run
fsck on it.  
	We tried just recently to put this on a different Linux box.  We
have the exact same software configuration on this other box, but it's a
single processor AMD-K6 333.  This machine can't handle the load, and
eventually dies in the same way.  (As it dies, loads are 80+.)
	Please help!  We're going to switch to BSD even though NFS locking
doesn't seem to work...
