Subject: Why is tulip in its own directory (at least to 2.4.8) ?

I've just changed the NIC on my main box from a natsemi to a tulip. The
natsemi module was in /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/drivers/net along
with the ppp modules, but the tulip module is in a tulip subdirectory.
Is there a good reason for this ?
