I think it's pretty clear that the brand would have to entail a very 
specific meaning, like "drivers for this device are open source and in 
the upstream kernel" or somesuch.  Anything else would dilute the 
meaning of a penguin sticker (or whatever it is) so much as to be 
useless I think, as you point out.
Now, who's in a position to make this happen?  Maybe Linux International?  
(I think Maddog mentioned something like this at a Kernel Summit a few 
years ago.)
