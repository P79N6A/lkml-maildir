I just tried this device out for fun, although I would really like to
use it.  It's a USB 802.11b interface, UB11B (MS-6823).  I tried it on
three VERY different motherboards, both with 2.4.22 and 2.6test8
kernels: exact same error, so I'm pretty sure it's specific to this
device.

Device info here:
http://www.msicomputer.com/product/detail_spec/product_detail.asp?model=UB11B
Unfortunately it doesn't specify the chipset anywhere in the
documentation.
Please CC me if you need any more information or a sample of the windows
driver or the hardware.
Thanks for your help, 
Austin
