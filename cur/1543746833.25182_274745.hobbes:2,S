found the bug that causes the fd detection failure. It's a generic race
in the upstream floppy driver, which happens to work by chance in the
vanilla kernel but breaks when IRQ and softirq threading is enabled:
when the FDC hardware is initialized, it sometimes generates a floppy
interrupt right away - without being told to. This interrupt can hit the
detection code that executes right after the initialization code, in
particular it can get intermixed with user_reset_fdc() that the
detection code uses. The fd driver is fundamentally single-threaded when
it comes to handling events: an unexpected irq that arrives in the wrong
moment can confuse the reset_fdc() code, which, with softirq and hardirq
threading on, executes in keventd.
in the stock kernel this stale irq doesnt seem to hit the detection code
in the wrong moment, but i think under certain circumstances it may
still happen. One of the typical incarnations of the race was the
following message:
 reset set in interrupt, calling c0258400
and googling for "reset set in interrupt, calling" does turn up a fair
number of bootlogs (most of them 2.4 ones) that show such a detection
failure, so i think upstream wants to have the fix too.
the fix is simple: delay a bit after initialization, to make sure the
stale irq does not interfere with the detection code. It will be safely
ignored, since do_floppy is still NULL. It might look sloppy that i went
for a delay, but delay i think it is better than waiting for the irq to
occur, because i dont think there's a guarantee that fdc initialization
triggers an interrupt, so waiting for it could hang the boot process. A
delay OTOH is totally harmless.
The attached patch implements this fix, which resolves the detection
problem on my testbox.
here's again how a failure looks like:
 Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
 reset set in interrupt, calling c0258400
 floppy0: no floppy controllers found
and this is how it works with the fix:
 Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
 FDC 0 is a post-1991 82077
i've tested this on vanilla 2.6.10-rc2-mm3 too (to make sure this doesnt
break the floppy driver), and it should work fine in -BK too.
(this does not solve the irq threading related SMP lockup though, i'm
attacking that problem next - now that my fd0 gets detected fine ;-) )
