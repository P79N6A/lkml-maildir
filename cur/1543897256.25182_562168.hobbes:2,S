Can you clarify - what is the current behaviour when ENOSPC (or some other
error) is hit?  Does it keep the current fallocate() or does it free it?
For FA_ZERO_SPACE - I'd think this would (IMHO) be the default - we
don't want to expose uninitialized disk blocks to userspace.  I'm not
sure if this makes sense at all.
