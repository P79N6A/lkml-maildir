O_TRUNC actually ;-)  See:
	
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/open.html

If O_CREAT is set and the file did not previously exist, upon successful 
completion, open() shall mark for update the st_atime, st_ctime, and 
st_mtime fields of the file and the st_ctime and st_mtime fields of the 
parent directory.
If O_TRUNC is set and the file did previously exist, upon successful 
completion, open() shall mark for update the st_ctime and st_mtime fields 
of the file.

Given we are talking about truncate, we only care about O_TRUNC.  
O_CREAT/O_EXCL of course set A/C/M time as the file is newly created and 
hence all three values are set to the current system time!
