This has already the case with the hotfix tree since 18 months or so. A
hotfix release is issued when there are important fixes. Anyway, I was
thinking about releasing pre-releases more often. Also, you might have
noticed that the slowdown is more important during -rc for obvious reasons.
To solve this problem, I intend to maintain a 'next' branch in the tree
which will contain the fixes that can wait for next version. It should
help us batch the fixes and reduce the latency between important fixes
and the associated release.
Regards,
Willy
