	Besides , if someone's browsing the code using 'gid' one would
	have to first discover where xxxx_t is defined and realise it's
	typedef'ed to struct _xxxx_t and then we'd start to find where
	the heck _xxxx_t is .
	I'm not saying code needs to be written keeping in mind ease
	with which we can run code browsing tools, but avoiding unnecessary
	typedefs can certainly help here.
