I don't really like "force", it's IMO a bit too strong and too unspecific 
(although enable is here only a bit better). The first I'd rather call 
"visible", but I don't see a need for this and I wouldn't immediately know 
how to support this, a config entry can have multiple prompts and every 
prompt has its own dependencies, so which one should I enable? It would 
probably be easier to enable/force the dependencies so the prompt becomes 
visible.
But I'm open to suggestions for a better name, "select" might be a good 
alternative. Other ideas? Opinions?
bye, Roman
