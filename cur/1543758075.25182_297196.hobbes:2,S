I think a function is the most sensible. And a good idea, it should
reduce the icache pressure in the loops (although gcc does seem to
do a pretty good job of moving unlikely()s away from the fastpath).
I think at the point these things get detected, there is little use
for having a dump_stack. But we may as well add one anyway if it is
an out of line function?
