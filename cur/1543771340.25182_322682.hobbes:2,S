Funny you should mention this. Check the latest -mm code and you'll see Andrew 
has merged my smp nice code which takes into account "nice" values and alters 
balancing according to nice values and heavily biases them when real time 
tasks are running. So you are correct, and it is a problem common to any 
per-cpu runqueue designed scheduler (which interestingly there is evidence 
that windows went to in about 2003 because it exhibited this very problem). 
However my code should make this behave better now.
