No, it isn't, that's the whole point.

(spotted by Andi) util-linux-2.10o/mount/nfs_mount4.h:
struct nfs3_fh {
        unsigned short          size;
        unsigned char           data[64];
};
(see also nfs_mount_data structure in both kernel and mount)
I also don't understand Alan's comment, what has the cast of data to a
structure have to do with the size of a field in the structure? Furthmore the
cast of data to a struct should work on all architectures as far as C is
concerned (if you then run alignment problems then it's your mistake).
As far I can see the only reason size makes sense to be 32bit is to get some
more strict behaviour in the below code (to avoid discarding the most
significant 16bits in sanity checks like this):
nlm4_decode_fh(u32 *p, struct nfs_fh *f)
{
        memset(f->data, 0, sizeof(f->data));
        f->size = ntohl(*p++);
        if (f->size > NFS_MAXFHSIZE) {
                printk(KERN_NOTICE
                        "lockd: bad fhandle size %d (should be <=%d)\n",
                        f->size, NFS_MAXFHSIZE);
                return NULL;
        }
        memcpy(f->data, p, f->size);
        return p + XDR_QUADLEN(f->size);
}
So for now I backed it out. If you want to push it in again then implement it
right and make an mount backwards compatible nfs_fh type for the
nfs_mount_data.
