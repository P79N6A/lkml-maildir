Where can I start to do that? 
Can you tell me how I can set the debug_level to 3 or 5?
Why do I get this errors on make modules when I compile the driver with
IDETAPE_DEBUG_LOG_VERBOSE to 1 in ide-tape.c?: gcc -D__KERNEL__
-I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer
-fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686
-malign-functions=4  -DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include
/usr/src/linux/include/linux/modversions.h   -c -o ide-tape.o ide-tape.c
ide-tape.c: In function `idetape_sense_key_verbose': ide-tape.c:1395: warning:
