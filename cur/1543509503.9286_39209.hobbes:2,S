I've seen similar errors, as well:
Sep 13 17:56:57 banzai2 kernel: ATAPI device hdc: 
Sep 13 17:56:57 banzai2 kernel:   Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05) 
Sep 13 17:56:57 banzai2 kernel:   Illegal mode for this track or incompatible medium -- (asc=0x64, ascq=0x00) 
Sep 13 17:56:57 banzai2 kernel: hdc: command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error } 
Sep 13 17:56:57 banzai2 kernel: hdc: command error: error=0x54 
Sep 13 17:56:57 banzai2 kernel: end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00 (hdc), sector 1446 
[root@banzai2 /root]# cat /proc/ide/hdc/model
NEC CD-ROM DRIVE:28B
This was on a normal CD-ROM drive, but the CD in question was burned
by HP DirectCD on NT.  The errors only occurred when I was trying to
dd if=/dev/hdc ....  It was repeatable any time I tried to access
certain blocks.  I didn't see any errors if I mounted the CD and just
used the filesystem on it.
