Hi all,
    aftre upgrading to 2.5.39 my DHCP client stop to work. I noticed it 
in previous releases too. Last kernel which I'm sure that works is 
2.5.24 (I may try to iterate exact version, but some releases do not 
even boot on my machine). Had something changed in this area between 
these two?
