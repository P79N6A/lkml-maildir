Do the timestamps need to be precise and accurately reflect the
arrival time in the irq handler?  Or, for TCP timestamps, would it be
good enough to use the time when the protocol handlers are run, and
only read the hardware clock once for a bunch of received packets?  Or
even use jiffies?
Apart from TCP, precise timestamps are only used for packet capture,
and it's easy to keep track globally of whether anyone has packet
sockets open.
