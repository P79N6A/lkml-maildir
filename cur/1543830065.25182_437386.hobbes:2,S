I put in an option to enable this mode, do pfmon --help. I think it's called
edge-mask.

Try the option, and let me know if it does not work for you.

You can do this on your athlon using pfmon already, you need to enable a
different sampling module. Here is an example:
$ pfmon --smpl-module=inst-hist -ecpu_clk_unhalted -k --long-smpl-period=100000 \
     --resolve-addr --system-wide --session-timeout=10
This will sample (period of 100,000 cpu_clk_unhalted) in the kernel ONLY for 10s and print  a flat
profile sorted by #samples/instruction addresses. You can chose any event you want. Note that you can
also use this output format in per-thread mode.
Hope this helps.
