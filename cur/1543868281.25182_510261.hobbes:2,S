With this fix it still looks somewhat broken:
[889227.698252] device id = 2440
[889227.698261] device id = 2480
[889227.698264] device id = 24c0
[889227.698268] device id = 24d0
[889227.698271] matched device = 24d0
[889227.698274] matched device id 24d0
[889227.698280] pci_read_config_byte : 4
[889227.698289] esb2rom: esb2rom_init_one(): Unable to register resource 0xffc00000-0xffffffff - kernel bug?
