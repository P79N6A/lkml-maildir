     I've got two machines that are essentially identical save for the fact
that one has slightly more RAM and the other a 2nd disk controller, one running
innd, the other running Apache.
     The Apache web server actually runs itself out of memory faster under
2.1.12, despite the fact that it has more physical RAM, so this problem is not
limited to INND. 
     I am back on 2.2.10 now as 2.2.11 and 2.2.12 have proven completely
unusuable here, while 2.2.10 with half a dozen patches people provided is
approaching usability.
     Incidentally, David Miller, the patch to Sparc assembly you provided does
not seemed to have materially helped.  I applied it to 2.2.10 as well, hoping
it might help there (since the memory leak in 2.2.12 made it unusable), but it
still will do that same spinlock thing.
