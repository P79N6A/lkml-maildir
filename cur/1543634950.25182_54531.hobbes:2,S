You redefined it in what might be a useful way...
My question is, if the race condition involves use of a module after it's
removed, is removing it and leaving it in memory going to be better? With
a driver for an unregistered device be more likely do the right thing even
if it's in memory? Isn't the right thing to make everything stop using the
module before ending it, for any definition of ending? Because I certainly
can't define what the right thing to do would be otherwise, at least in
any general sense.
It seems slightly like that tree falling in the forest, and no one to hear
it. Much easier to handle removal right than service requests after close.
