The issue is putc[s]. Th eothers could be done pretty easy. The question 
is do we want to use fbcon for text modes. Fbcon is so big and heavy for
text mode. The /dev/fb interface in this case also doesn't make sense.

I have patches that explain the new cursor api. Right now I'm recovering 
from being sick so I haven't worked on fixes.

Look at fbmon.c. There are functions that can generate reasonable values.
Personally I like to see tha ability to set the pixclock via sysfs.
The truth is that I never had go luck with that functionality. Many 
drivers would freak out when I switched modes.
> Removed fastfont support. No way for it with current API.
Its there but I haven't implemented it yet, struct pixmap. In this case 
struct pixmap would be a static map not a dynamic map as it is currently. 
We can fix that one together.

Each framebuffer will need a indepenednt timer.

Ah the broken console system. Blanking is the same way. When the console 
system blank all VTs blank. I will be working on my VGA/MDA system and 
then all the sudden both console go blank. This will take some magic to do 
without touching the core console code.
