Well, Linux offers a generic SCSI (/dev/sg*) transport, so it should be
able to do this in a way that is independent from the SCSI transport.

The drive does not return this information, but the SCSI subsystem creates
these instance numbers. A SCSI drive (like a CD/DVD burner) is supposed to
be known to the SCSI sub-system and thus needs to have a SCSI subsystem
related instance number.

Cdrecord is a program that needs to be able to send any SCSI command as 
it needs to be able to add new vendor unique commands for new drive/feature
support.
