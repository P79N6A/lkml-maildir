Hi Steffen!
You should
- make bzImage the default for 2.2.x and later, since it does run most
of the time and zImage shuold be considered the unusual case.
- leave out 'make clean' for later 2.2.x and 2.3.x kernels, since I
think that has been made obsolete (my kernel compiles just fine w/o it
and make xconfig does not say anything about it any more)-
- prompt for dev kernels, e.g. like this:
CAUTION: You are trying to build a DEVELOPMENT kernel. This means that
         there is no guanrantee that it will even compile correctly.
         Do you know exactly, what you are doing?
         Have you checked www.kernelnotes.org for any known broken
         feature that can chew your system up and laugh at you?
anwer 'yes' or 'NO':
Maybe this prevents some people from thinking 'Well, three's more'n two,
so let's check out...'
Marc
