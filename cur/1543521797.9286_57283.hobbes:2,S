The purpose is to get rid of what I consider an ugly hack. Since
CONFIG_SMP is a proper config option, it and only it should be used IMHO.
What is the purpose of having a config option symbol (CONFIG_SMP) define
another symbol (__SMP__) ?
External modules built for SMP kernels should already define CONFIG_SMP if
they use any header files from the kernel, as CONFIG_SMP is used by some
files under the linux/include directory. The change is that they don't
need to define both __SMP__ and CONFIG_SMP.
