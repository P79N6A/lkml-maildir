Actually, not gone cold, but I stopped posting about it because it's
been solved and I thought agreement had been reached that it should be
pushed to mainline before 2.6.25.
I am very happily running with Ingo's "snd hda suspend latency:
shorten codec read" patch, which was originally intended to speed up
resuming from hibernation, but which as I discovered, also has the
nice side effect of eliminating the reported error.  
On 11/23, Takashi replied to my note (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/23/17
)
and suggested that Jaroslav push this patch to Linus immediately
instead of waiting for 2.6.25, since it appearly solves two problems
with one stone.  However, I just checked, as of Linus's public, and
Ingo's patch is *not* in mainline.
However, as far as I am concerned, Ingo's patch, first posted to LKML
here: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/16/66
 should be listed as fixing
the above regression.  Rafael, could you please make a note of this in
your regression list, and could we please get this patch pushed into
mainline?
Thanks!!
