Subject: [PATCH 03/13] checkpatch: Add warning for p0-patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/7/132

From: Wolfram Sang <w.sang@pengutronix.de>
Some people work internally with -p0-patches which has the danger that
one forgets to convert them to -p1 before mainlining. Bitten myself and
seen p0-patches in mailing lists occasionally, this patch adds a warning
to checkpatch.pl in case a patch is -p0. If you really want, you can
fool this check to generate false positives, this is why it just spits a
warning. Making the check 100% proof is trickier than it looks, so let's
start with a version which catches the cases of real use.
