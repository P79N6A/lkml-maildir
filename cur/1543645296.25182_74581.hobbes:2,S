You're right.
I had the vague hope that by separating type definitions only
some future cleanup might help us to cut down on the number of
headers included by task_struct.h (currently 60).
Introducing a full-blown task.h looks like killing sched.h completely
after suficcient cleanup, which might be a route worth going.

Definitely. request_irq() and free_irq() look like candidates for
<linux/interrupt.h> or a new <linux/irq.h> (it was suggested to move the 
old <linux/irq.h> to <asm-generic/hw_irq.h>).
Killing ~600 #include <linux/sched.h> lines however seemed enough for a 
first round, so I left this for later iterations.
