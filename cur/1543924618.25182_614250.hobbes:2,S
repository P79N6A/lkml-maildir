-There are a few network parameters that can be tuned to better match
-the kernel to your system hardware and intended usage. The defaults
-are usually a good choice for 99% of the people 99% of the time, but
-you should be aware they do exist and can be changed.
-
-The current list of parameters can be found in the files:
-
-	linux/net/TUNABLE
-	Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt
-
-Some of these are accessible via the sysctl interface, and many more are
-scheduled to be added in this way. For example, some parameters related 
-to Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) are very easily viewed and altered.
-
-	# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/arp_timeout
-	6000
-	# echo 7000 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/arp_timeout
-	# cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/arp_timeout
-	7000
-
-Others are already accessible via the related user space programs.
-For example, MAX_WINDOW has a default of 32 k which is a good choice for
-modern hardware, but if you have a slow (8 bit) Ethernet card and/or a slow
-machine, then this will be far too big for the card to keep up with fast 
-machines transmitting on the same net, resulting in overruns and receive errors.
-A value of about 4 k would be more appropriate, which can be set via:
-
-	# route add -net 192.168.3.0 window 4096
-
-The remainder of these can only be presently changed by altering a #define
-in the related header file. This means an edit and recompile cycle.
