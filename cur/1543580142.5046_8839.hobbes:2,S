So we assume: if you have no RT threads running, Linux does the right
thing. If you have RT threads running, you want them to run no matter
what Linux does. This may be over-simple, but it's robust. 
Otherwise you end up with either (A) an impossible to verify mess
of many code components each hoping that the aggregate of the others
will behave correctly or (B) a semi-functioning high overhead centralized
priority system that slows everything down and probably does not
work anyway.

But there is a reason for the first: time. 
while(!read_pci_condition); // usually finishes in 10us
versus
while(!read_pci_condition)yield(); // usually finishes in 1millisecond
can have a nasty impact on system performance.

Not a cheap vehicle.  Linux is pretty snappy on an AMD SC420  or
a M860 and 5 meg of memory. And it scales to a quad xeon well. Don't
try that with IRIX.  
So to push my tired metaphor even further beyond
the bounds, a delivery van that needs jet fuel and uses two lanes, 
won't do well in the delivery business no matter how well it 
accelerates.
