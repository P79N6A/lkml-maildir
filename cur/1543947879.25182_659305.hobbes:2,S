Then a better way to encode the page size would be returning the page
shift. This would need 6 bits instead of 4, but it would probably be
enough for any 64 bit architecture.

I don't like the idea of parsing thousands of entries just to find out
that I'm using a huge page. It would be much better to just get the page
size one way or the other in the first entry one reads.

I like them, they make the code much more readable.

AFAIK the way huge pages are used on x86 differs much from other
architectures. While on x86 the address translation stops at some upper
table for a huge page, other architectures encode the page size in the
pte (at least the ones I looked at did). So pmd_huge() (and soon
pud_huge()) are very x86-specific and return just 0 on other archs, and
this code would be optimized away for them. All that would be necessary
for other archs is to eventually get the page size from the pte and put
it in the psize field.
The #ifdef could go away if pmd_pfn() was defined as 0 for !x86, it
wouldn't make sense to use it anyway.
