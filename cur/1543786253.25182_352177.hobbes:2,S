This has been discussed time and time again on this list and elsewhere
over the years. The most recent discussion I recall is the "[PATCH
x86_64] Live Patching Function on 2.6.11.7" thread which drew over 50
comments and got into a lot of corners - I'd suggest you go read it in
the archives.
Spend a little time searching and you'll find several other threads
about this in lkml archives.
