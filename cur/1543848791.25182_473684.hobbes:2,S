Subject: getting a return from a system call

Hi,
I'm trying to build a system call which returns a float, and is defined as :
asmlinkage float sys_ph_pinfo(int pid, int mode)
but in a user level program every time, I evaluate it, I always get a return 0!
How do I capture the return of a system call?
Also is it possible that a system call return a structure or array?
Will that be available in user space? My hunch is that this is not
possible, as kernel memory space is disjoint form the user memory
space, but just for information.
Regards,
Irfan
