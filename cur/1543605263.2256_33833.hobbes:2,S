If Emacs is configured to save backups (it is shipped with this option
on by default) the existing file is renamed to the backup name and the
new, changed file is saved in a fresh file.  Thus the trick of diffing
two co-linked trees of files should work as expected.
Emacs users should look in the info node "(emacs)Backup Copying" for
complete information on this.
