It looks like your using sched_clock() through out .. It's a little
troubling considering the constraints on the function .. Most
architecture implement a jiffies sched_clock() w/ 1 millisecond or worse
resolution.. I'd imagine a millisecond hold time is pretty rare, even a
millisecond wait time might be fairly rare too ..  There's also no
guarantee that sched_clock timestamps off two different cpu's can be
compared (or at least that's my understanding) ..
