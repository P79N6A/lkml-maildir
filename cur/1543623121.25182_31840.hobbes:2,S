	I hope you are sure about this solution for fib_select_multipath
because I'm not. IMO, the solution from Andi looks more correct
for the current scheduler.
	What about the new scheduler (for 2.5?), of course, after
replacing the wrong write_lock() with spin_lock_bh(&fib_nh_powers) ?
This lock will be used only in fib_select_multipath because
fib_sync_{up,down} will not play with nh_power. It will protect
only nh_power and I hope the DEAD flag change will not make big
problems for fib_select_multipath.
