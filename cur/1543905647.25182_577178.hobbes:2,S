Please have a think about what we can do to aid this debugging.  For
example, add an uncondtional printk into request_irq() for now which tells
us what irq is being registered - a print_symbol() of the irq_handler_t
would be pretty good, although I suspect there are a lot of interrupt
handlers with the same name..
