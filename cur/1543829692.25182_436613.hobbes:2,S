On x86 I think the main saving is the icache one. However I guess
gcc would try to align with the branch prediction behaviour for
unknown branches too.
The microoptimisation is that the call avoids the unlikely branch
in kfree. Maybe for x86 this isn't going to matter, but for some
architectures in might.
