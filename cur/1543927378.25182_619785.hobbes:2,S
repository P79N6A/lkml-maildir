I'm sure the additional parameter will be needed, and it might be pretty
involved.  I think the current notion of syslets needs, at the very least:
 - a userspace stack and IP to return to after going async
 - the completion context when completed async
 - a pointer to a return code when completed without blocking
We'll see.  I'm working on it.
