I don't see how you can do otherwise. The very definition of
"whitespace" is locale specific. Throwing it at the target as one string
lets the kernel stay out of locales, languages, policy and other parsing
horrors. Splitting it has to be done properly or its a non reversible
operation and tools can't correct the kernel screwups
