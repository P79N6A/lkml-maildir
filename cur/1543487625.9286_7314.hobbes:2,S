The patch is complete redesign for the ide-driver to ease th integration
of the old-balls into the mainstream with less pain in the future.
The ALI series requires pre-init code to be run on the pci-bridge and the
ide host adapter to get it to setup, before we can try to configure DMA
transfers and of the BIOS is wacky and needs more stuff.
