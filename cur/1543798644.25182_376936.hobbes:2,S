True in many cases. However in a lock fastpath one could do the
atomic_cmpxchg without an initial load, assuming the lock is
unlocked.
atomic_cmpxchg(&lock, UNLOCKED, LOCKED)
which should basically wind up to the most optimal code on both the
cmpxchg and ll/sc platforms (aside from other quirks David pointed
out like cmpxchg being worse than lock inc on x86).
Ah - I see you pointed out "for general consumption", I missed that.
Indeed for general consumption one should still be careful using
atomic_cmpxchg.
