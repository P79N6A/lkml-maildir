I presume you mean 'object_id'.  What you're asking for is a new 
requirement, and one which I don't believe is achievable in the current 
timeframe.  Since this is spufs code that's dynamicaly loaded into the 
SPU at runtime, the symbol information for this code is not accessible 
to the userspace post-processing tools.  It would require an altogether 
different mechanism to record samples along with necessary information, 
not to mention the changes required in the post-processing tools.  This 
will have to be a future enhancement.
