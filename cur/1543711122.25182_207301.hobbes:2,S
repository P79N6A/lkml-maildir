For once, that's good.

I hope not.
static int __filemap_fdatawrite(struct address_space *mapping, int sync_mode)
{
	int ret;
	struct writeback_control wbc = {
		.sync_mode = sync_mode,
		.nr_to_write = mapping->nrpages * 2,
	};
When you initialise some of the structure in this way the compiler will
zero out all the other fields.
(gets worried)
yup.
struct thing {
	int a;
	int b[1000];
};
foo()
{
	int a[1000];
	memset(a, 1, sizeof(a));
}
bar()
{
	struct thing t = {
		.a = 1
	};
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
		if (t.b[i]) {
			printf("bad\n");
			return;
		}
	}
}
zot()
{
	struct thing t;
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
		if (t.b[i]) {
			printf("good\n");
			return;
		}
	}
}
main()
{
	foo();
	bar();
	foo();
	zot();
}
