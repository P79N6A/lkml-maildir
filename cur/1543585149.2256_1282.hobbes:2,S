At 
https://high-res-timers.sourceforge.net
 we are trying to define a
high resolution timer patch for linux (please join us if you are
interested).  We would like to know who wrote the time list management
code that is currently in the kernel.
Or
Any help on any studies done on the nature of the timer list.  The code
seems to indicate that most entries are in the first 2.56 seconds from
NOW.  Has this been verified?  Are there other hidden issues we should
know about?
