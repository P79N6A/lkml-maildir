Bill,
Hmm.  
The disks I'm working with aren't mounted and are not being used for
swap.  There are no applications holding any partitions open.
At the time I'm modifying a disk's partition tables, there are no users
of any partitions on that disk.
I experimented removing and adding partitions in 2.4.18, and repeating
those experiemnts in 2.5.43.  The two versions of OS definately
behave differently.
