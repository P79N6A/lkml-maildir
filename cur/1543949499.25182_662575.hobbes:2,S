Agreed, but equal priority threads can always cause unbounded latencies by definition.  I.e. we only guarantee to the highest thread.

This isn't a bad idea, but note that it means RT tasks will not get a performance boost, which is quite substantial.
Note that I have substantially cleaned up this patch for the drop I will make later this week (v3).
