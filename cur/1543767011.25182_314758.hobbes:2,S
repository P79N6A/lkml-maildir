Why should the kernel set the result to -ENOSYS? If the debugger
invalidated
the system call, entry.S will just skip the system call and gprs[2] will
keep
the value that the debugger put there. But if regs->traps still indicates a
system call and there is another signal pending do_signal will try to
restart
the system call. In case of sys_(rt_)return there is no system call anymore
because the debugger = UML took care of it. That's why UML wants to have
access to regs->traps.

In theory the debugger may want to intercept specific system calls and
do magic things instead but still want to have the system call restarting
to intercept it again after the (guest) signal has been delivered. You
just don't know.

At least strace and gdb won't do it.

Why on the host ?!? Now I'm really confused. I thought the problem is the
regs->trap value in the guest system, how can a signal pending in the host
have an effect on the guest?

The patch does a very specific thing that UML needs, hardcoded into the
ptrace
interface. Who knows what kind of things other user of ptrace might need?
I don't claim to know, and that is why I don't like to see this done in the
syscall_ptrace function. Perhaps via peekusr/pokeuser interface but then
trap should be a member of struct user.
