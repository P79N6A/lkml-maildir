Olaf:
We have seen the same pattern of file corruption during compiles when
mounting AIX NFS shares on Linux 2.2.5 (Red Hat 6.0). I do not know if the
NFS code in 2.2.12 differs significantly from what Red Hat patched into
its version of 2.2.5, but the pattern of corruption that you describe is
identical to what we saw. This corruption occurred with a brand new AIX
box (as of 2 months ago), as well as one that is several years old;
unfortunately, I do not remember the exact AIX versions at this time.
I can confirm, however, that the problem can be worked around by using a
smaller value of rsize and wsize. Using rsize=2048,wsize=2048 for the NFS
mount definitely avoids the bug, as does rsize=1024,wsize=1024. (The
tradeoff is probable performance loss and increased load on the server)
We also tried recompiling Linux and commenting out
	#define NFS_PAD_WRITES 1
in fs/nfs/nfs2xdr.c, as suggested in previous e-mails on linux-kernel;
however, this did _not_ solve the problem.
