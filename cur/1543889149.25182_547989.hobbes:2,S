The checksyscalls.sh errors come from the fact you have missing
definitions in asm-blackfin/unistd.h, however, you still have reserved
slots for most of these syscalls (and explicit sys_ni_syscall wrapping in
the syscall table), just no __NR_foo definition.
It's also not clear which of these you are explicitly never going to
support versus the ones that simply haven't been implemented yet (ie,
kexec support, restartable system calls -- how do you even do
ppoll/pselect6 without supporting these?, and so on).
I would suggest simply defining the __NR_foo values based on the reserved
slots that they already occupy in order to silence these warnings, at
least that's a closer approximation of "we've actually looked at these
syscalls" than "new or otherwise unintentionally unimplemented", which is
what the script aims to help with.
