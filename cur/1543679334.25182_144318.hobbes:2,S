Subject: [PATCH] ___arch__swab64() causing compile breakage
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I just noticed that with the new implementation of 
___arch__swab64 in 2.4.21 (i386), kdemultimedia-3.1.x won't 
compile.  Basically it tries to include <linux/cdrom.h>, which 
in turn tries to include <asm/byteorder.h>, and it tries to 
compile it all with g++ -ansi.  ___arch__swab64() is partly to 
blame.
Now as much as we may call this a KDE bug, the old 
___arch__swab64 implementation didn't have this problem.  In the 
old implementation, both the __u64 type (from <asm/types.h>) and 
the ___arch__swab64() macro (which depends on the __u64 type) 
didn't get defined in userland for __STRICT_ANSI__ code.
With the new implementation taken from SGI XFS, __u64 still isn't 
defined for __STRICT_ANSI__ code, but ___arch__swab64() is 
exposed to the world no matter what.  Run that through gcc 
-ansi, and you get an instant parse error! ;)
That's reason enough to rectify this annoying little 
inconsistency.  I suggest we either let both code bits stay with 
__STRICT_ANSI__ defined, or we leave out at least the 
___arch__swab64() macro with __STRICT_ANSI__ defined.  I'm 
personally in favor of putting the old __STRICT_ANSI__ check 
around the new ___arch__swab64().
