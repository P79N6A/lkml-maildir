And this is NOT the case here. You need ONLY CAP_SYS_ADMIN to use
HDIO_DRIVE_CMD , not CAP_SYS_RAW. And THAT can (and should) be fixed.
Kernel SHOULD NOT try to prevent exploits, but kernel MUST prevent
access to hardware when user (and root!) have no rights to do so.
Unfortunatelly Andre goes completely other way: ide.2.4.0-t5-2.all.4c.patch.bz2
does not have CAP_SYS_RAW word at all !
