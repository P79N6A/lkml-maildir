> 1. What are the char* -> char array conversions of "version" strings for ?
char*="blah" generates a char pointer variable, pointing to the constant
string "blah".  char[]="blah" eliminates the char pointer variable, so
the resulting code is [slightly] smaller.

looks ok at a glance, I will probably apply it after reviewing further.
note a further cleanup is to look at each driver, and make sure (a) it
-always- printk's version if -DMODULE, and (b) if only printk's version
if hardware is found, if not -DMODULE.  You can look at pci net drivers
in 2.4.4-pre6 for an example of how I did this.
