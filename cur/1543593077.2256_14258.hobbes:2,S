The suggested patch has one non-obvious side effect which somebody in
irda needs to verify is OK.  Previously irda_proto_init() and
irda_device_init() were called after every other driver had
initialized.  Now irda_proto_init() is called based on the object order
in the top level Makefile, so irda is initialized before i2c,
telephony, acpi and mddev.  Is this a valid initialization order?  If
not, move
  DRIVERS-$(CONFIG_IRDA) += drivers/net/irda/irda.o
to the end of the drivers list and document why it needs to be there.
