Hi,
Today, there are several functionalities or improvements about futexes included
in -rt kernel tree, which, I think, it make sense to have in mainline.
Among them, there are:
	* futex use prio list : allow threads to be woken in priority order instead of
FIFO order.
	* futex_wait use hrtimer : allow the use of finer timer resolution.
	* futex_requeue_pi functionality : allow use of requeue optimisation for
PI-mutexes/PI-futexes.
	* futex64 syscall : allow use of 64-bit futexes instead of 32-bit.
The following mails provide the corresponding patches.
Comments, suggestions, feedback, etc are welcome, as usual.
