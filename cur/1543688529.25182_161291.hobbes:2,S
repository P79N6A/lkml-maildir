The part of the patch that does the HPET initialization for timer
interrupt, and general HPET registers read/write/programming can be
common across architectures.
However, different archs diverge, when it comes to gettimeofday-timer
implementation (tsc, pit, itc, hpet, ) and we may still have to keep
that part architecture specific. 
Thanks,
Venkatesh
