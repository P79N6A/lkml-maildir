Now, I have tested the -rc1-mm1 and things got worse: it doesn't matter if
I use plain -rc1-mm1 or if I modify sbp2.[ch]. The result is that I can't
see my Firewire drive.
Going to 2.6.13-rc1 with the modification to sbp2.[ch] seems to make the
drive work fine (that's what I am using in this exact moment).
Thanks, Rogério Brito.
