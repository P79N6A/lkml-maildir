Subject: [PATCH] struct export_operations: adjust comments to match current members
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/14/118

From: "Marc Dionne" <marc.c.dionne@gmail.com>
The comments in the definition of struct export_operations don't match the
current members.
Add a comment for the 2 new functions and remove 2 comments for unused ones.
