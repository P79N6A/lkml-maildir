Anyone who has refused to upgrade their userspace tools since installation is 
almost certainly running daemons with known security exploits in them.
What are these people whinging about, and why are we bothering to listen to 
them?
Tools change. Bugs are found and fixed, and sometimes you have to upgrade.
Get used to it - it's not going to stop happening. 
If people want a system where they don't have to upgrade their tools to fix
known bugs, then they should opt for something commercial which doesn't 
actually bother to fix such bugs under the next 'service pack'.
