Yes, IMHO, it should be at least more readable when we can see where
this RCU is really needed.
But, after 3-rd look, I have a few more doubts (btw., 3 looks are
still not enough for me with this code, so I cerainly can miss many
things here, and, alas, I manged to see util and msg code only):
1. ipc_lock() and ipc_lock_check() are used without ipc_ids.mutex,
but it's probably wrong: they call idr_find() with ipc_ids pointer
which needs this mutex, just like in similar code in: ipc_findkey(),
ipc_get_maxid() or sysvipc_find_ipc().
2. I'm not sure this refcounting with ipc_rcu_getref/putref is SMP
safe (memory barriers): it's not atomic, so locking is needed, but
e.g. in do_msgsnd() kern_ipc_perm lock is used for this, while
freeque() calls ipc_rcu_putref() with ipc_ids mutex only.
3. Probably similar problem is possible with msr_d.r_msg which is
read in do_msgrcv() under rcu_read_lock() only.
