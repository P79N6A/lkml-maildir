  OK, I can make it 'depends on NET' instead. I guess it's no problem in
this case since whoever wants quota is going to have NET enabled.
  The problem I sometimes have with 'depends on' is that the option is
invisible until you have enabled all the dependencies so it's hard to
  a) find out that there exists and interesting feature (because it depends
on something you are not used to turn on).
  b) you know the feature exists but you have to dig in Kconfigs to find out
what you have to enable first...
  Maybe we could improve Kconfig to support other type of dependency that
shows you the option even if these dependencies are not satisfied (probably in
some other color) but allows you to only view help and unresolved
dependencies...
