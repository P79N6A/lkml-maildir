CONFIG_NR_CPUS has no affect on NR_IRQS in 2.6.18.
So this test unfortunately told us nothing.

Cool.  I'm glad to know it was simply a buggy lmbench.
What is sysconf(_SN_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) doing that it slows down as the
number of irqs increase?  It is a slow path certainly but possibly
something we should fix.  My hunch is cat /proc/cpuinfo...
