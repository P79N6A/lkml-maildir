[snip complex interaction in standard kernel]
Shaya, if you want a VM where you can easily change the page
replacement algorithm, you probably want to work on top of my
'rmap' patch. The VM in that patch uses reverse mappings to
determine which process uses a page, so you could put normal
clock, lru, ... algorithms on top of it.
Things like swap_out() are completely gone in my patch, it's
just one selection based on physical page.
regards,
Rik
