Passing GFP_ZERO into kmem_cache_alloc() is such a bizarre thing to do,
perhaps a BUG is the correct response.
I guess it could be argued that the kmem_cache_alloc() callers "knows" that
the ctor will be zeroing out all the objects, but it would seem cleaner to
me to pass the "you should use GFP_ZERO" hint into kmem_cache_create()
rather than kmem_cache_alloc().
