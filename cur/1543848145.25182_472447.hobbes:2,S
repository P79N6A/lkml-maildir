Hm, let's see why bus_attach_device() might fail:
* device_bind_driver() failed to create some symlinks. We may
consider not to fail in this case, since sysfs_remove_link() is fine
even for non-existing links.
* probing failed for one possible driver with something other than
-ENODEV or -ENXIO. Not sure if we really should abort in this case.
We'd just end up with an unbound device, and a driver returning (for
example) -ENOMEM for probing may just be a really dumb driver trying to
allocate an insane amount of memory (and the next driver might just be
fine).

One way to fix this would be to make device_bind_driver() always
succeed (even without symlinks), the other to call the ->remove
function if device_bind_driver() fails (assuming that the ->remove
method should undo the stuff done in ->probe).

Shouldn't subsystems that need attributes early just use dev->groups,
class->dev_attrs or bus->dev_attrs? These attribute groups are added
before the uevent is generated.
