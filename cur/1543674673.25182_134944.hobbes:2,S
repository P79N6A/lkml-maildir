I don't think that NPTL has any bearing on the underlying issues that I mentioned, though path lengths are probably a bit shorter.  It should also handle contention substantially better, but that wasn't tested.

(With static linking that decreases to 658 for pthreads.)  Pthreads (and/or some of the other infrastructure) is clearly getting better, but I don't think the difference will disappear.
To make things more fair you should test against pthread spinlocks. Also,
for tight loops like that, even an extra call deep level (that pthread is
likely to do) is going to matter.
