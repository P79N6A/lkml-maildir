I just realized that the error I am seeing on 2.4 is from partition
detection code on my ls-120 drive. The bug I was seeing on 2.4.20 must
have been fixed already. However I do think there is still a bug on
2.5.65+ on the driver, I will look into it further once I can manage to
boot a 2.5 kernel again.
Thanks,
