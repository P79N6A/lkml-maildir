No, sorry. Common units is main goal of that class. If you're saying
"energy" you always know that it's uWh. It's better for both userspace
(don't bother to parse anything from kernel) and kernel itself.
No need to invent new kernel<->userspace protocols, no need to do
useless string manipulations in kernel itself.

Current battery class assumes values are not averaged. I.e. momentary
values. In general, it's userspace' job to collect statistics. Though,
if hardware can report only average values, it's just okay to use
usual attributes.
Also, if you your battery can collect and report its approximated values
in additional to momentary values, you're free to add _AVG attributes
to standard ones and use them.
