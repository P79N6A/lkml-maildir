Why can't this happen inside the regular startup scripts?  They know
where to put such files; the kernel-level stuff doesn't--I can't think
of any current situation where the kernel writes to an arbitrary file
in the filesystem as it boots.  Sure, /var/run is in the FHS, but that
doesn't mean every system will have it.
IMHO, since /var/run/dmi is not needed by any stage of the kernel
boot, it should be created in the regular startup scripts (invoked by
init(8)).
