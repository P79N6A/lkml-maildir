Our headers basically consist of:
1) Macros
2) Structure declarations
3) Function declarations
4) Inline functions
The number of structures and functions which need only "struct xxx *"
is very high: removing typedefs is something about with ~zero pain
(unlike dropping the sometimes-dubious loveaffair with inlines).

PS.  I blame Ingo: list_t indeed!
