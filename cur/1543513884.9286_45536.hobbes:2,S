Subject: How to port a kernel module from 2.2 to 2.3

I've got a kernel module (a sound driver) which hasn't been ported to
2.3 yet.  (The maintainer doesn't have the time to do this at the
moment and doesn't want to run 2.3 at all.)
What is the correct approach to port a driver?  I fiddled with the
code and although the code compiles without warnings, the machine
instantly reboots when I insmod the module. :( (Perhaps I didn't get
the wait_queue right or the semaphore stuff.)
Unfortunately, Documentation/Changes lists only changes visible to
userland.
