Let me repeat, I think this is more correct too, and personally
I agree with this change.
But I do not know if this change is "safe", please see below.

Sorry for confusion, I didn't mean this will confuse the users
of ->pdeath_signal, I just do not know. But they need the
notificatation about the thread, not process.

I don't know. I vote for your patch as is. (but please update
the changelog).

Again, I don't know.
But. Let's suppose we have the user-space application which
uses .si_pid to figure out which thread hits SIGPIPE. Yes,
this is ugly because the signal is thread-specific, but this
works until this patch.
Actually, I don't understand most of (all?) users of
send_signal(SIGXXX, current, 0), SEND_SIG_PRIV looks more
logical to me. Or, _perhaps_, we need yet another SEND_SIG_SELF
which sets .si_pid = task_pid_vnr(target).
