Subject: Trident sound driver - global registers not restored

Hello!
The driver for Trident sound cards in 2.4.2-ac20 has functions
ali_save_regs() and ali_restore_regs() that are supposed to save and
restore the hardware registers over the power management events.
ali_restore_regs() restores mixer and channel registers from memory, but
it _saves_ the global registers instead of restoring them:
ali_registers.global_regs[i] = inl(TRID_REG(card, i*4));
It must be an error (most likely a result of cut-and-paste).
Regards,
Pavel Roskin
