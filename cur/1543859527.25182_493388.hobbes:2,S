	This seems like a bad idea, I can come up with a number of cases where 
the priority of a request would better be optimized by a higher level 
subsystem, rather than a simple prioritization based on the command type.
The original suggestion to provide both head and tail insertion options 
seems like the obvious solution, short of a full priority queuing system.
