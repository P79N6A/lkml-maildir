I have an AMD K6/2 333MHz system that has shown no problems..   It now
has 9 days uptime with 2.2.0-pre9, and before that it had ~ 1 month
uptime with 2.0.36.  The motherboard is a Tyan 1590S board, VIA MVP3
chipset.  I've done several kernel compiles, use it as MX mail machine,
NFS server, etc.  I'm wondering if the problems people are seeing are
VIA implementation problems, not VIA problems...
At 333MHz I'm running a bus speed of ~95MHz.  Are problems only
appearing at 100MHz?
For what it's worth, here's cpuinfo (from 2.2.0-pre9):
