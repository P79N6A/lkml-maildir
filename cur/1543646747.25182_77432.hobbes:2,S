        max_threads = mempages / (THREAD_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE) / 8;
- init_task.rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_cur = max_threads/2;
- init_task.rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_max = max_threads/2;
+ /*
+ * we need to allow at least 10 threads to boot a system
+ */
+ init_task.rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_cur = max(10, max_threads/2);
+ init_task.rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_max = max(10, max_threads/2);
why not simply:
	max_threads = mempages / (THREAD_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE) / 8;
+	/* we need to allow at least 20 threads to boot a system */
+	if (max_threads < 20)
+		max_threads = 20;
+
	init_task.rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_cur = max_threads/2;
	init_task.rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_max = max_threads/2;
i think we're going to see more kernel threads with 2.5 than we did with 2.4;
let's be safer.
