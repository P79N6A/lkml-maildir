Hi!
I've been getting these messages in the syslog recently. As a result, I am
unable to access one of my directories in $HOME (which is NFS mounted).
I've tried to access the dir. directly from the NFS server, and it works
fine.
Is there any way of solving this besides rebooting? It's also quite
frustrating to not have the ability to do forced unmounting, since that
implies that you have to reboot /whenever/ you get a stale NFS handle.
(minor note: the exact error in this case was just "I/O error".
FEATURE SUGGESTION: It would be very nice (IMHO) if Linux could support
forced unmounting, /and/ have some sort of cache-mechanism that would (for
a short period of time) cache the currently open files, so that any open
client sessions (or X sessions) would not be affected by the remount.
Perhaps it would be possible to implement this in the remount option of
mount?
This is also a great worry for me at work when using NCPfs, since whenever
the Novell server goes haywire, the umounting the volume is impossible.
The errors are as follows:

Is there any hope that Linux will support forced unmounting anytime soon?
From last I looked at the "mount" package, it hadn't been updated since
August-98.
