Ok, now its clear that I have a big troubles with hardware.
I compiled kernel 2.2.18+IDE_patches with support for VIA chipset and still get
errors of type:
kernel: hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
kernel: hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
before these kernel reports a long string of messages
kernel: hda: Write Cache SUCCESSED Flushing!<6>hda: Write Cache....
Probably it's not a question for this list but what should I do and how can
I determinate broken hardware? (Or configuration? I still hope that it's not a
hardware)
