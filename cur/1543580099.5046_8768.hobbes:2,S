Guess what, Linux works not around PMTU black holes either for the
same exact reason we will not work around ECN.
I'm getting a bit tired of you, and I suppose others are as
well.  You are being nothing but a pompous ass.
Anyways, let me quote a comment from the Linux source code where
we would have done PMTU black hole detection:
			/* NOTE. draft-ietf-tcpimpl-pmtud-01.txt requires pmtu black
			   hole detection. :-(
			   It is place to make it. It is not made. I do not want
			   to make it. It is disguisting. It does not work in any
			   case. Let me to cite the same draft, which requires for
			   us to implement this:
   "The one security concern raised by this memo is that ICMP black holes
   are often caused by over-zealous security administrators who block
   all ICMP messages.  It is vitally important that those who design and
   deploy security systems understand the impact of strict filtering on
   upper-layer protocols.  The safest web site in the world is worthless
   if most TCP implementations cannot transfer data from it.  It would
   be far nicer to have all of the black holes fixed rather than fixing
   all of the TCP implementations."
                           Golden words :-).
