To me, "atomic_read" means a read which is synchronized with other 
changes to the variable (using the atomic_XXX functions) in such 
a way that I will always only see the "before" or "after"
state of the variable - never an intermediate state while a 
modification is happening.  It doesn't imply that I have to 
see the "after" state immediately after another thread modifies
it.
Perhaps the Linux atomic_XXX functions work like that, or used
to work like that, but it's counter-intuitive to me that "atomic"
should imply a memory read.
Later,
Kenn
