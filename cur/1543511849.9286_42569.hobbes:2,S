You might take a look at the c.o.l.n thread "ADSL problems", there is a
claim that there is "a bug recently found in the 2.2.* packet scheduler"
that is still present in 2.2.12 .  The symptoms don't seem to be the same
as you see but you're better qualified to judge of course... 
You might also check the kernel mailing list archives.
BTW I use 2.2.9 and ppp-2.3.10 and haven't noticed anything particularly
strange - but then I probably wouldn't notice anything wrong that wasn't
really outstandingly wrong. :)
