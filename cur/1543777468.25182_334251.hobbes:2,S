No, jiffies _cannot_ be in nS, because of the fact that then it doesn't 
fit in a word any more. A lot of things want timeouts in the tens of 
minutes, and a jiffy clock that tries to ne in nS just screws that up 
entirely, and forces people to use u64.
Which is much more expensive to compare on 32-bit architectures due to 
nasty atomicity issues. 
So you want to keep the "normal" timeout 32-bit. In ten years we may not 
care any more. For the forseeable future we definitely do.

That's not what "jiffies" are about. If you want accurate time, use
something else, like gettimeofday. The timeouts are _only_ relevant on the
scale of a timer interrupt, since by definition that's what we're waiting
for.
So accuracy is a total non-issue. The only kind of accuracy we care about 
is "how often can the timer ticks happen".
