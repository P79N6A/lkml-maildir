Looks very interesting, particularly for debugging interactions among
groups of demons and/or the kernel. I've had a quick look at your
screen shots and the patch and the following things came to my mind:
 - analysis looks a little cryptic and crowded. If you allocate more
   vertical space per process, you can stack information vertically,
   avoiding overlaps.
 - the information available should really be similar to what strace
   has. If your process is always just reading messages, then sending
   a few, you really want to know what's inside of them. Manually
   combining trace information obtained from multiple sources is tricky
   and error-prone.
 - I like the idea of tracing bottom half handlers; now it should also
   trace interrupts
 - you should be able to turn off part or all of the traceing at
   compile time, such that you can use the same source tree for normal
   kernels.
 - there should be a means for user processes to explicitly add data to
   the trace (this can be trivial, without any extra system calls or
   such: create a symlink /dev/tracer -> /dev/null; let process open it
   and write user data to it; in trace analysis, you catch "/dev/tracer"
   and label it as user data)
I haven't looked at it in detail, but do you also have text output ?
Sometimes you really want to run a few scripts over traces before they
become even remotely useful ...
Looks like a nice tool with a lot of potential.
