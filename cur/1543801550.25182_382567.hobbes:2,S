Vladimir is in France skiing, as this is Russian Christmas right now. 
Zam says that this merely means that the underlying device does not
support write barriers, and the code uses synchronous writes for commits
instead of write barriers when this happens.  It should not affect
correctness.  He will comment more this evening (russian time) when he
gets home.   He suggests that he should change it from warning to
notice.  He also suggests that this code is new code, so it is possible
it has bugs.....
