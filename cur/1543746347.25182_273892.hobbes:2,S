Sure, it could be done w/ an i_flags bit. However, since it's explicitly
related to the security infrastructure, I think it's more appropriate
there. There's no change in the size of inode_security_struct, and the
addition of the deref is trivial given how many other places in the
file-io path use the same call table. That said, I'll change it to use
whatever ends up being agreed upon. I'm just looking to get selinux to
not call xattr routines on reiserfs-internal files/directories.
