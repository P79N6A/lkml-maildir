I agree with the sentiment.  I just don't think variable size SG tables
will remain the exclusive province of SCSI forever.

Yes, this is our nastycase, especially for locking and ref
counting...you didn't say I only had to hand off the easy problems,
though...
Hotpluggin has to have some awareness of this locality too.  Even for
IDE, hot unplug a card and you can lose two devices per cable.

Pretty much yes, now.  We lost all of our memory allocation nightmare
problems when we moved away from fixed command queues per device to lazy
command allocation using slabs.
