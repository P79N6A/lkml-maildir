How about putting a check for PG_inode and a periodic dump_stack()
wherever page->mapping is cleared?  That should at least let you catch
the culprit who is clearing them. __remove_from_page_cache() is the only
real place I see this being done.
Are you remembering to clean PG_inode when a page is freed?  Perhaps
it's allocated for the page cache, reclaimed, returned to the allocator,
and reallocated as anonymous memory where you're seeing the null
->mapping.  Might want to check for PG_inode in free_pages_check().
