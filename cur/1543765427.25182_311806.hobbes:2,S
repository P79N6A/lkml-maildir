If all else fail - an *old* card.  This wasn't a problem before,
therefore it doesn't have to be now.  Unless you want to run
very new software that won't perform on those older cards.
Todays faster cpus may help though.
Look to 
http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/
 for information about
which cards have open drivers and how well they work.
Some cards have specs available, others are reverse-engineered
to the extent that a driver have been written.

I have the impression that 2D is fine with ATI cards, even those
that doesn't have open 3D drivers.  And even a really old low-end
card performs fine for 2D work.  Even the unaccelerated
framebuffer drivers seems to have enough performance
for 2D in most cases. The cpu is fast these days. :-)
