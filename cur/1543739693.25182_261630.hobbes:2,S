I don't know about /dev/input/mouse1.  But the oops isn't a bug... it's a 
weakness in the way Linux implements loadable kernel modules.
What your log showed was that some program was still using a USB device at
the time uhci-hcd was unloaded.  There's nothing illegal or wrong about
that, but the unload procedure doesn't wait for the reference count to
drop to zero -- the module is unloaded from memory right away.  Then some
time later on, when that other program finished using the device and the
reference count did go to zero, the system tried to call a release routine
in the unloaded module.  The result was an oops, as you saw.
