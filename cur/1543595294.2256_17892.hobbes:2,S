I have the same machine with 64 MB ram, and it's quite well supported with
linux. I do most of my daily work on it (except for large builds). I've
really tried to use all the hardware in it, and everything is usable. The
only minor problems are:
- hibernation (yeah, unfinished ACPI work, but the machine is said to have
 a compliant ACPI implementation)
- sound playback and recording (opl3sa2) doesn't seem to work at the same
 time (some DMA problem, there was a patch on the list around the 2.4.3
 time but it was included somewhat differently into the ac tree, i'll try
 the original patch to see if it works)
- ToPIC97 freezes with the yenta driver, i had to put it into ToPIC95
 compatibility mode in the bios. I haven't tried the pcmcia-cs driver, but
 they finally claim to have the correct specs. This is as of 2.4.3-ac3,
 maybe it is already fixed.
- the ide driver is missing, but someone already requested the specs
 ( 
http://linux.toshiba-dme.co.jp/linux/eng/develop.php3
 ), maybe it will
 be available soon. But i don't think it would make much difference with a
 slow old notebook drive... And linux is still much faster than m$.
- After resuming from APM suspend, sometimes 'hda lost interrupt', and the
 only escape is a hard reboot... Should try different apm settings?
And the positives: toshoboe seems to stabilize, usb and X are fine, and
my 3Com Megahertz 3CCFEM556 works flawlessly.
I'll try to debug some of the problems, and send more usable info...
