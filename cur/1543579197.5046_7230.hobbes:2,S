Subject: Hang when booting 2.4.0/2.4.1-pre8 on Compaq 1850R with SMART 3200

I'm currently experiencing difficulty booting Linux 2.4.0 on a Compaq
1850R server with a SMART 3200 controller on board.
When the SMART array is detected and the cpqarray driver is loaded,
the system hangs at the following point:
Compaq SMART2 Driver (v 2.4.1)
Found 1 controller(s)
cpqarray ida/c0d0: blksz=512 nr_blks=17764320
Partition check:
 ida/c0d0:_
The partition check never starts.
I get the same results when booting 2.4.1-pre8. The system works fine
with the 2.2.x kernel series, but I need some of the functionality in
the newer 2.4.x series.
Any ideas?
Ian
