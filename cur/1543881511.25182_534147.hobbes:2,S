Hmm.  The rate limiting probably makes lots of sense for
dirty_exceeded==0, when ratelimit can be a nice large value.
For dirty_exceeded==1 it may make sense to disable ratelimiting, OTOH
having a granularity of 8 pages probably doesn't matter, because of
the granularity of the percpu counter is usually larger (except on UP).

Yes, this is the part of this patchset I'm personally interested in ;)

Yes.  But current logic says, that if you convert "write_chunk" dirty
to writeback, you are allowed to dirty "ratelimit" more. 
D: number of dirty pages
W: number of writeback pages
L: global limit
C: write_chunk = ratelimit_pages * 1.5
R: ratelimit
If D+W >= L, then R = 8
Let's assume, that D == L and W == 0.  And that all of the dirty pages
belong to a single device.  Also for simplicity, lets assume an
infinite length queue, and a slow device.
Then while converting the dirty pages to writeback, D / C * R new
dirty pages can be created.  So when all existing dirty have been
converted:
  D = L / C * R
  W = L
  D + W = L * (1 + R / C)
So we see, that we're now even more above the limit than before the
conversion.  This means, that we starve writers to other devices,
which don't have as many dirty pages, because until the slow device
doesn't finish these writes they will not get to do anything.
Your patch helps this in that if the other writers have an empty queue
and no dirty, they will be allowed to slowly start writing.  But they
will not gain their full share until the slow dirty-hog goes below the
global limit, which may take some time.
So I think the logical thing to do, is if the dirty-hog is over it's
queue limit, don't let it dirty any more until it's dirty+writeback go
below the limit.  That allowes other devices to more quickly gain
their share of dirty pages.
