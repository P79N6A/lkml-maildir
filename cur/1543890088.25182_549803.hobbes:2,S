Yes, the first is TX (BCM4401 --> e100) and the second is RX. Both are tcp 
connections. I think iperf does display the ip addresses wrong in the second 
connection, but that's another issue.

When I ran 2.6.21.1 or 2.6.22-rc3 without any debugging tools just in normal 
use I didn't notice any problems. It did work fine as I would expect it.
I think the wget and ping tests here are as they should be.
With 2.6.22-rc2-mm1 I noticed that connections seem to be slower. The ping 
test does confirm this, because here response times are very high. As far as 
I can remember the wget download rate was a bit slower than 2.6.21.1 or 
2.6.22-rc3 till it stalled.
I would expect it to be someting like the other two kernels. The two problems 
I see are the high ping times and the fact that the card stopped working.
I don't know why the iperf results are so different from my personal 
experience. I guess the fact that I get so bad results with 2.6.21.1 and 
2.6.22-rc3 is that iperf does something that causes the system to be 
extremely slow and thus degrading performance. This could be a bug somewhere 
in the b44 driver of 2.6.21.1 and 2.6.22-RC3 that has unintended been fixed 
by the ssb switch, but that's only a roughly guess.
