I hadn't heard of tmpfs but it seems to work great.  There doesn't
seem to be much documentation on it though.  I need two ram filesystems
in my box, and no hard disk. It boots off cdrom.  So with a 128 meg
experimental box I tried the following.
swapoff -a
mount -t tmpfs -osize=35M /dev/shm1 /mnt1
mount -t tmpfs -osize=35M /dev/shm2 /mnt2
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt1/junk bs=1024000 count=100
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt2/junk bs=1024000 count=100
It seems to work but I'm a little worried about the /dev/shm1 and 2.
It doesn't seem to matter if they even exist or not, they don't seem to
do anything.  Is this just placeholder candy for fstab and the mount
command, or am I missing something?
