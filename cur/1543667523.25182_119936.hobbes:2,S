Another possibility just occured to me.
It'd be useful to add a feature that adds a check to the
build process..
"Download post-release errata ? [Y/n]"
and have it wget patches from k.o, verify signatures and auto-apply them,
which removes the "admin didnt even know there were patches
that needed to be applied" possibility.
