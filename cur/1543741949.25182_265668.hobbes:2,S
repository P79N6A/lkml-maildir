Problem is not related to the nvidia driver.
OOPS is 100% reproducable. I boot into X, and run    eog 
/mnt/camera/dcim/100cresi    and BANG.
I've reproduced it on 3 boxes I have, each with different usb adapter 
hardware and only 1 with the nvidia driver loaded.
It seems to be when eog (eye of gnome) loads thumbnails that this happens.
