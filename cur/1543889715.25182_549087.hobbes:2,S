If I understand correctly, the original issue was whether to allow passing
vfsmount to the inode_create LSM hook or not. Which is independent from
AA or "pathname based MAC", I think.
It is proven that Linux can be used without that change,　however it is
also clear that current LSM cause the ambiguities as AA people has
explained. Clearing ambiguities is a obvious gain to Linux and will make
benefits for auditing besides "pathname based MAC".
So here's my opinion. If anybody can't explain clear reason (or needs)
to keep these ambiguities unsolved,　we should consider to merge
the proposal.
Thanks.
