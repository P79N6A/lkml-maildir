Subject: [patch] modules bound checking for optional module members
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

This patch is needed to allow module generated by kernel that are using
optional memebers (starting from persist_start to my new lock_end) to be
loaded also with not optional-mebers-aware `insmod` binaries:
(patch against 2.2.5)

For example init_module can be the first function of the .text section and
so if insmod is not aware of the optional fields of the module struct,
insmod could put the ->init address at an address lower than `mod+1'
because the `struct module' of the kernel is longer than the `struct
module' used by userspace.
persist_start is the _first_ optional member, so we know that if the
address of the userspace-member is lower than the address of
m->persist_start we _must_ fail the module-initialization.
