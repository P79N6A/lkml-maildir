    I am using kernel 2.4.1 with compressed Ramdisk on  Hitachi SH board ,
with no battery.   When i run kernel first time , it works fine , it
uncompress Ramdisk and i get my shell prompt .    But when i restart it
second time (with out  removing power cable ) kernel dies when
uncompressing Ramdisk.   But , if i remove my power supply for more than 5
minutes , and then i start again , it works again.   It seems that in 2.4.1
and/or later versions has  Ramdisk Initailization or uninitialised memory
problem. But i faced no problem  with 2.2.12 kernel.   Thank you,  
Best Regards,   Jaswinder (and his wonder machine).
