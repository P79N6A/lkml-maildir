The problem is that it WON'T degrade gracefully. Suppose we
have 5 readahead streams, A B C D and E, and we can store
4 readahead windows in RAM without problems. A page which has
not yet been read is marked with a capital letter, a page
which has already been read is marked with a small letter.
The queue looks like this, with new pages being added to the
front and old pages being dropped off the right side:
	AAaaBBbbCCccDDdd
With the current use-once thing, we will end up dropping ALL
pages from file D, even the ones we are about to use (DDdd).
With drop-behind we'll drop four pages we have already used,
without affecting the pages we are about to use (dcba).

Ummm, if you're still busy trying to come up with the idea,
how do you already know your future idea will require an extra
LRU list? ;)
cheers,
