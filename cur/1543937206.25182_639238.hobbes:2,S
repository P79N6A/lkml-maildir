Incorrect - if it's not detected first time around (eg, the port isn't
accessible at that time), its slot will still be reserved due to the
way slots are given out.
Slots are given to users in order of:
1. does the IO type and base address of a previously known port match
   the new port?  If so, use that.
2. do we have a slot which has never been used - use that.
3. find the first slot which is not currently in use.
So, the only way we'd get the first set of ttyS slots used is if all of
the following are true:
a) the ISA probe doesn't detect them
b) some other driver registers many ports which don't correspond with any
   of the ISA listed addresses and we run out of empty slots
c) 8250_pnp initialises after this driver
(c) is unlikely, except in the modular case - we explicitly list 8250_pnp
immediately after the 8250 driver so that it gets first call on the
slots during initialisation time, before we probe for PCI devices.
