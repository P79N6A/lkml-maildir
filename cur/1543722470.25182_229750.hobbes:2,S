This has come up repeatedly. As far as I recall, Linus has never said
anything. The de facto situation can be seen by just inspecting the
MAINTAINERS file. Kai Makisara has a diaeresis on the first vowel of
his last name. Today (2.6.6) that is still coded in ISO 8859-1.
In old discussions people who disliked 8859-1 expressed strong preference
for plain ASCII (possibly with TeX-like escape sequences for non-ASCII).
These days it seems that, if anything is changed, the only reasonable action
would be to switch to UTF-8.
