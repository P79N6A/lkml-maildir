This might be a good time to recommend -Werror. Last time it came up
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102654562025374&w=2),
Alan was dead set against it, and Linus did not apply it, but did
think it had some merit
(http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=102658611213914&w=2). 
Compiling 2.6.0-t5-cvs with my .config and -Werror uncovered only two
warnings. Patches sent seperately.
