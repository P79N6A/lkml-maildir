I don't think this is neccessarily true: I think that platforms with
64-bit compare-and-exchange can do the whole thing in userspace.  They
would set the mutex and stamp in the thread ID simultanously, allowing
for "dead thread" detection (ie. I didn't get the lock, and it's a
robust mutex: check the holder is still alive).
W/o 64-bit compare-and-exchange a 100% robust solution may not be
possible though.
Thoughts?
Rusty.
