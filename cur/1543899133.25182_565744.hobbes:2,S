The normal situation is big database or other bloated software runs; clears 
all the dcaches, then enters kernel. Kernel has a cache miss on all its data.
But icache access is faster because the CPU prefetches.
We've had cases like this -- e.g. the additional dcache line
accesses that were added by the new time code in vgettimeofday()
were visible in macro benchmarks.
Also cache misses in this situation tend to be much more than 48 cycles
(even an K8 with integrated memory controller with fastest DIMMs is 
slower than that)  Mathieu probably measured an L2 miss, not a load from RAM.
Load from RAM can be hundreds of ns in the worst case.
I think the optimization is a good idea, although i dislike it
that it is complicated for the dynamic markers. If it was just
static it would be much simpler.
