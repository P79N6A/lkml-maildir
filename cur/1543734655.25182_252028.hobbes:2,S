The concern appears to be that the tools might interpret failed
permission checks as indications of process nonexistence. I don't
regard this as particularly pressing, as properly-written apps should
check the specific value of errno (in particular to retry when EAGAIN
is received in numerous contexts).

Distinguishing between EPERM, ENOSYS, ENOENT, etc. could probably be
done if the fields are measured in units such that the top bit is never
set for any feasible value, then a fully qualified error return could
simply be returned as (unsigned long)(-err). I suspect VSZ may be
problematic wrt. overflows even for 32-bit, not just for 31-bit.
