I can find one prior release with this subject (-v11) , what was the
subject prior to that release? It's not a hard rule, but usually >15
patches is too many (check Documentation/SubmittingPatches under
references).. You might want to consider submitting a URL instead. 
I think it's a benefit to release less since a developer (like myself)
might know very little about "Swap over Networked storage", but if you
submit 10 patches that developer might still review it, 40 patches they
likely wouldn't review it.
