As a driver author (2.4 timeframe, embedded platform, see gitinc.com
for the hardware description), I would rather msleep did what it says
it's going to do. If the current one can wait 20 times longer than you
ask for, then that's just broken.

"Hidden problem"? Lots of hardware has quiescent wait-time
requirements, to guarantee that whatever is going on it it's little
state machine head finally reaches a stable state. Waiting for those
changes to take effect before starting the next set of register
reprogramming is a common requirement -- on the hardware I've worked
with at least.
