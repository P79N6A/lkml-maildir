That's the problem trying to support devices in production.
The last kernel I was able to locate for the x86_64 project
is linux-2.6.23. Its dates are from late last year so maybe
it will work!
It is now being compiled one one of the target machines.
If this works, I'll have to find the differences between
the old and the newer and patch the linux-2.6.11 because
it is a "certified" kernel, i.e., selected by the FAA and
determined to be politically correct!
I was hoping that somebody who works on these projects
would just reply with "just change the xyz mask to ...."
and it would work!
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
