Shortcuts are not symlinks, so much as that they *contain* symlinks.  A
shortcut is a blob of shell metadata that tells Explorer how to run the
thing it points at, as well as where to find it.  The closest analogue in
Unix would be a wrapper shellscript that sets up the environment and runs
an app. with switches supplied.
