Those people can modify and ship a version of modutils that does not
issue the taint message.  That makes it their problem, not ours.  I
know of at least one embedded system distributer who is doing just
this.
If you want to ship binary only modules and you don't want your users
to question this, removal of the warning messages is your problem.  GPL
allows anybody to change any messages they like as long as they supply
the changed source.  I will not (cannot) stop people changing modutils
to defeat community expectations but I will not support them either.
