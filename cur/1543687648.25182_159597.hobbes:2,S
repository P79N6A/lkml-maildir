Wait, I'm confused again.
How can the user "write" to the mmap()'d side if PROT_WRITE
was not specified?  That is the only case in which the proposed
patch could make a difference, we check this:
	switch (flags & MAP_TYPE) {
		case MAP_SHARED:
			if ((prot&PROT_WRITE) && !(file->f_mode&FMODE_WRITE))
				return -EACCES;
Therefore if the user can write to the page, file->f_mode will
have the write bit set too.
So the proposed patch looks bogus to me.
