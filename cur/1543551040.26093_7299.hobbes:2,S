Hmm.. The current order is the same as in 2.2.x, and puts aha17xx _after_
the other ones. Or did that change in the later 2.2.x series?

So change the drivers/Makefile to put scsi before i2o and
drivers/scsi/Makefile to do the aha17xx thing first, and we're all done.
(Not that I think any distribution would come with i2o even enabled at
this point, and the scsi ones all tend to be modules too).
End of story. No "reorganizations" needed.
