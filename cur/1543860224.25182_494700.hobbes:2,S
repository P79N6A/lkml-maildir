Hi,
since one gets random corruption if a user gets this wrong, at least
make things like floppy and all CONFIG_ISA stuff conflict with this
option.... without that your patch feels like a walking time bomb...
(and please include all PCI drivers that only can do 24 bit or 28bit
or .. non-32bit dma as well)
