So there is no real reason.

I find -scanbus rather annoying, particularly since it doesn't scan all
buses, I need to query cdrecord for the implemented transports, run
-scanbus for each of them again, and everything.
I know what device my writer has, SG_IO is sufficiently capable to write
CDs, is the declared standard for Linux parallel ATA-PI devices and I
want cdrecord to stop pissing at my leg for knowing the device up front.

It appears as though the high-level driver gave you exactly that
generic mid-level access. If Linux violates design principles, is none
of your business as long as your application works.

Yes, 20 years ago. How relevant is this for OSes that needed to be
updated in 2005 to support cdrecord again?
And what has this got to do with libscg's bogus assumptions ("If I
cannot have /dev/hda, I don't need to probe /dev/hdc anyways") after
you've agreed that resmgr and similar to allow console users access to
ONLY the writer were no major security risk?

We don't have ASPI on Linux, you're digressing.
