OK, that may have sounded selfish, but I'm not really in a position to
know how much or how little other hardware works the same way as mine
(where the device returns a 32-bit handle).
I'm quite prepared to accept that I would be the only driver writer to
benefit from an API change (in which case all this is moot) but I had
no easy way of knowing this - I posted to l-k for a bit of discussion.
I missed the original discussion of the DMA mapping things, does
anyone have a pointer to this?

Portable, once the 32/64 bit issues are sorted out. Clean, I agree,
but write-only. The new API is good for anything with more than 4Gb of
RAM but imposes overhead (over the status quo) for everyone else.
[why reverse maps via page-tables are expensive]
OK, traipsing through tables is expensive. pci_unmap single does it -
the incremental cost of returning the original CPU pointer will not be
great (if it is possible at all). However, there are other ways of
performing reverse lookups (hash-tables, for example) in the face of
write-only (or close to write-only) hardware. I am not suggesting that
you stick in hash-tables, just thinking with my fingers.

Ideas don't "go in", code does. I am not about to write a patch in the
face of your opposition. I think you exaggerate, it does not, for
example, look like bus_to_virt is going to last forever.

I have a nice piece of hardware, that manages state (32-bit handle)
for me. It is just a shame that I will have to hack further state
tracking on top.
As it happens this is a Linux-only driver; I would imagine that the
majority of Linux (network) device drivers are as well.

#include <write-only hardware moan>
Going off at a slight tangent... all the costs associated with mapping
and unmapping skbs become a lot smaller if the buffers can be recycled
in some fashion. Is there a proper (clean, documented) way of doing
this? The ATM devops interface provided a hook for this and may still
do so, but I don't know if it is safe.
Giuliano.
