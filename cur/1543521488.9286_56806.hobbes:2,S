Could anyone point me to patches that get around the 2gb file size limit
in linux on 32bit systems (i.e. x86).. I don't need _much_ bigger files,
but I do need bigger ones none-the-less (4gb limit would be fine).. I'd
prefer a solution that gets ext2fs going 4gb files (if this is possible).
Thank you for your time,
