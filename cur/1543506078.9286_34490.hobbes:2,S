True, at the moment the attack succeeds the machine is lost. But the danger is
with machines on trust-networks. This would hinder covering up so an attack on
the next host could be mounted.
BTW: cat /dev/random > /dev/sda would be *bloody* slow.

That is why the user always has the choice whether or not to use security
feature X. I'm not suggesting putting it in the main kernel defaulting it to on,
I'm just poking around, looking for opinions and enlightenment.

I like to try at least both. But I agree, securing getting in bit is certainly
higher priority.
