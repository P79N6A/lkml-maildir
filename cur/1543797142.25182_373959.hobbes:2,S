the biggest pitfal by having this done by a commercial entity or an
entity with commercial funding is that there is a LOT of pressure to
call things with binary drivers also certified/working. 
It has to be an entity that can resist that pressure; if OSDL can,
great. But their funding is partially from sources that will try to put
that pressure on I suspect...
So I would almost rather have a separate "kicked off and supported by
OSDL" organisation with its own charter than have OSDL do it itself. I
can imagine OSDL feeling the same as well ...
