When I try to enable DMA on the second channel of my controller,I get the
following message:
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: timeout waiting for DMA
ide_dmaproc: chipset supported ide_dma_timeout func only: 14
hdc: irq timeout: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hdc: DMA disabled
ide1: reset: success
Why is this happening?
What is the difference between the first channel where DMA works just fine
and the second one?
Thanks in advance.
