Sharing pagetables across process contexts seems to be relatively
effective. Reclaiming them also curtails various worst-case scenarious
and simultaneously renders all others techniques optimizations as
opposed to workload feasibility patches.
I'm having a tough time getting too interested in these today. I'll
just add to the list for now (if you will).

It does do poorly there according to benchmarks. I don't have anything
specific to say for or against it. It's sensible as a general idea and
has its benefits but has theoretical and practical drawbacks too. I'm
going to have to let those involved with it address things.

There's definitely an argument brewing here. Large 32-bit is very space
conscious; the rest of the world is largely oblivious to these specific
forms of space consumption aside from those tight on space in general.
I don't know that there can be a general answer for all systems.
