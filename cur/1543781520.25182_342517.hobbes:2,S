Alan,
I am sorry I don't have time to properly review the patch at
themoment, just a couple of comments about serio - I would not look at
serio for examples of typical use as it was trying very hard to work
around the original driver model limitation that prevented drivers to
register childern on the same bus from their probe function. I think
now that that limitation is lifted serio implemenation can be
simplified.
