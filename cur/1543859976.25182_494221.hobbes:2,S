OK, I applied your patch to yesterday's Linus' GIT. I will run it for
some days and will let you know if the problem represents. Please note
that it happened only twice and I don't have any clue on how to
reproduce it.
I added Pavel and Rafael to CC-list because for the first time in at
least six months my laptop failed to resume after suspend-to-disk
(userland tools) with this kernel. Guys, do you think that this
failure could be related to this BUG?
Best regards and Happy Holidays,
Fabio
