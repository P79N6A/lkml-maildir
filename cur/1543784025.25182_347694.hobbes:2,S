 Yep, it's an excuse for platform maintainers not to write proper drivers.

 Note that a few of MIPS RTC drivers are actually I2C devices that the 
fake code accesses directly bypassing the relevant I2C driver.  That may 
be a justified fallback for the one-off boot-time system clock setup when 
no suitable I2C driver has been built in, but for normal operation that's 
rather miserable.  As I happen to have a suitable system for testing, I 
may have a look at how to interface such drivers to a generic frontend.  
I'm not sure whether in this particular system the RTC chip's interrupt is 
wired though -- probably not -- so I may only leave this part of code to 
be tested by others.
