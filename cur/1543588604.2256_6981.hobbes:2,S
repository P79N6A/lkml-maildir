In the library loader I can certainly see it making a difference.

In practice I don't see it being a big deal.  But reliable code is
made by closing all of the little loop holes.  
It also improves consistency as all of the calls to do_mmap are
already protected in the exec paths. 
And of course since much of the code in the kernel is built on the
copy a good example neglecting the locking without a big comment,
invites trouble elsewhere like in elf_load_library.  Where we could
have multiple threads running.
