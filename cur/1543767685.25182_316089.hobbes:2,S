It's prohibited *because* it could be rather useful - to a hacker.  It's an
issue of information leakage - there are some corner cases where the permissions
on /proc/PID/mem would appear to allow a read, but you don't in fact want to
allow it (for the full list, look at the ptrace() code and the tests it makes
for things like euid != uid and so on).  There's a bunch of race conditions
in there too.

Same reasons.  ptrace() is able to make some checks and set some bits that
read() isn't allowed anywhere near (in particular, ptrace() can *stop* a process
so it can't race - read() can't do that.)
