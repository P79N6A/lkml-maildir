It actually requires more changes. The skbuff allocator needs to 
be fixed too to ensure a 64 bytes minimum length of the skb. 
(or alternatively if you don't want to penalize non ethernet protocols
read minlen from a dev-> field similar to hard_header_len and compute it 
in the caller, but that's likely overkill) 
But should be done.
