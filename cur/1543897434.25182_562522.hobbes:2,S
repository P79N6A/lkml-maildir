My laptop sometimes 'kicks' his keyboard. That means no key is working
any more, mouse is ok and I can copy and paste single characters in
xterms to enter some commands. Pasting 'reboot' in a root-xterm does not
work.
AFAIR it always happens when a DVB-T recording ends. But, even on daily
recordings, only about once a month. Ingo Molnar told me to activate
CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING. Since then I had

in dmesg right after bootup. Ingo said that xfs used to have problems
with lockdep, but that this doesn't mean there's anything wrong with
XFS, but that lockdep turns itself off after it finds the first locking
problem. So I formated the data partition as ext3, which gave me the
formerly posted info.

There was a typo in my mail, I'm running 2.6.21.5-cfs-v18, not 2.6.22,
sorry for that.

I'll run memtest86+ this night and post the results tomorrow.
