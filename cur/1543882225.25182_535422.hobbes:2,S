Hello Alan,
You re-use the same inode with multiple sparse pieces.
This way you avoid hopping around continuation inodes and coming back to 
same chunk with which you started but this time on a different 
continuation inode. This may not be I/O intensive for successive 
traversals if the continuation inodes are pinned in the memory, but it 
certainly is a waste of resource - inodes. Not allowing this would make 
worst case of every file having a continuation inode in every chunk, 
even worse; may be like only single file exist in the file system and 
rest all inodes in all chunks (including file's own chunk) are 
continuation inodes.
