It doesn't matter if you are using them or not, they are being created
by the usb core for the next-version of usbfs.  They currently are not
hooked up to anything properly, but people are working on them to fix
that soon.
And the number is just a placeholder, it's not a reserved major number.
As for what is trying to load the module, I have no idea, it must be
some userspace tool...
