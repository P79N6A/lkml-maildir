Actually... It is not _needed_ for suspend to disk, either. Snapshot is
atomic, so it should be okay to suspend with filesystems dirty.
_But_, if anything goes wrong, we'd prefer to have at least
filesystems synced. Battery running out during s2ram is not quite
uncommon, so we perhaps should do sync somewhere there. (But we can do
it before freezer just fine).
