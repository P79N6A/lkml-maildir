Subject: 2.5.56 won't boot (but 2.5.53 will)

So 2.5 is newly an obstacle on the machines I use for development
and testing.  There's the Cardbus issue (appeared in 2.5.53 as
far as I can tell) ... then there's this one (appeared in 2.5.54)
which I haven't seen posted before.
Symptom:  system hangs during boot, right where it's shown in the
annotated log below.  On 2.5.56 I also tried after disabling SMP
and all the local APIC stuff in the build, but it didn't matter.
These are otherwise the same .config setups, modulo whatever
magic "make oldconfig" did.
In case it matters, this is kt333-based with a vt8235 south bridge.
It's never shown this type of boot problem before.
Suggestions, or patches?
