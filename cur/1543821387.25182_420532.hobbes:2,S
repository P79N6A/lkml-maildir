Hi all,
No, is not this kind of error. The error message complaints about not beeing able to reference the contents of a pointer if you previously not allocate with kmalloc a location for it. Nothig has to 
bee initialized because the target and contents already exists.
Nothing happens if I initialize to NULL. An exception happens if I later free it with kfree instead of setting it to NULL.
Be aware that all this happens within functions included by bitops.h.
Regards,
Daniel
