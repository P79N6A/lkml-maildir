	Procmail. And in case of newsgroup everything still comes to your
server anyway. Moreover, *any* USENET group quickly attracts a f*cking
slew of cluebies. Just look at c.o.l.misc, for example. And one more thing
- you can't crosspost to the maillist (well, no *easy* crossposting using
Joe Average Luserware) so we are mostly spared from alt.destroy.microsoft
crew here.

	"General public" as in "h34, d00dz, I'v3 s33n an aw3sum 1ink 0n

<followed by HTML version>", right? Thank you very much, if you need that
stuff - get an AOL account.
	It *might* make sense to go to Usenet 2, but then most of folks
here would have *big* problems with access.
