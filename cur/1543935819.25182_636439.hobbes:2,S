This old chestnut again.  Perhaps we could have inode passed to unlocked_ioctl?
I never understood why it wasn't there in the first place if the plan was for
.unlocked_ioctl to supercede .ioctl whenever possible.
Device-mapper for example in dm_blk_ioctl(), has no need for BKL so drops it
immediately, but it does need the inode parameter, so it is unable to switch as
things stand.
