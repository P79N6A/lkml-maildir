Thanks for this report, Andrew!
	Yes, MAXMEM is reduced by one page in the patch, taking into account
that kernel memory tops out at __FIXADDR_TOP, not 0xFFFFFFFF.  AFAICT
this is in fact a bugfix, which becomes more important when
__FIXADDR_TOP can be moved to create a larger memory hole (as for
hypervisors).
	You now have 1 page more memory available in your system.  Use it
wisely.
I'm sure Gerd will slap me if I'm wrong on this.  Here's the patch
fragment:
-#define MAXMEM                 (-__PAGE_OFFSET-__VMALLOC_RESERVE)
+#define MAXMEM                 (__FIXADDR_TOP-__PAGE_OFFSET-__VMALLOC_RESERVE)
Cheers,
Rusty.
