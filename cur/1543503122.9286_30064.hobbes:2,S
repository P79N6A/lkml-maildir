i saw those too, hm. One thing to keep in mind is that 'lazy TLB state'
makes bugs live much longer than they live now, so lazy-TLB might just
have triggered an existing bug.
btw., in case you can reproduce the 'bad page middle entry ...' messages,
do they go away if you remove the lazy-TLB support for bdflush? (the
PF_LAZY_TLB changes in buffer.c)
