Hi Linus,
with the nasty /proc privilege escalation (CVE-2006-3626) it became
clear that we need to do something more to better protect us against
people exploiting stuff in /proc. Besides the don't allow chmod stuff,
Eugene also proposed to depend the a.out execution on the existence of
the mmap handler. Since we are doing the same for ELF, this makes
totally sense to me.
The attached patch implements the additional check for the mmap handler
and I hope you consider it for upstream inclusion.
Regards
Marcel
[PATCH] Require mmap handler for a.out executables
Files supported by fs/proc/base.c, i.e. /proc/<pid>/*, are not capable
of meeting the validity checks in ELF load_elf_*() handling because they
have no mmap handler which is required by ELF. In order to stop a.out
executables being used as part of an exploit attack against /proc-related
vulnerabilities, we make a.out executables depend on ->mmap() existing.
