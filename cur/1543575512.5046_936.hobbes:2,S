Let's see...
You pull the card (let's suppose it's Cardbus).  That causes an
interrupt which eventually gets fed to the PCI layer's
pci_remove_device().
The PCI layer calls the netdevice's pci_driver.remove() method.
Typically, xxx_remove() calls unregister_netdevice().
unregister_netdevice() downs the interface, then removes the
netdevice from the kernel namespace and then runs
'/sbin/hotplug net unregister eth0' asynchronously.
When we return from unregister_netdevice() we can guarantee
that the driver's module refcount is zero if this was the
last matching device.
We then wind all the way back to the PCI layer, whizzing gaily
back through the driver whose module refcount is now zero.  Sigh.
The PCI layer runs '/sbin/hotplug pci remove' asynchronously.  The
driver can be unloaded.
So where in all of this can you read the interface's network
settings?  Nowhere, I'm afraid.  They're released in
unregister_netdevice().
Isn't this a userspace tool problem?
