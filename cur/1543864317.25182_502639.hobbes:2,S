Moving farther has been my intention the entire time, even
while writing those patches.  I'm just not prepared to do it in
one giant patch where bug hunting becomes impossible.
I think I have moved msi.c to the point it won't be a horror to
work with, so we can start seriously looking at what it will
take to support hypervisors that do this.
I don't believe there is anything generic we can do in the general
hypervisor case, so we need a way for the architecture code in
the case where it is inappropriate to write directly to the msi
and msi-x registers to have a completely different implementation of:
pci_enable_msi, pci_disable_msi, pci_enable_msix, psi_disable_msix,
and whatever other driver interface bits we have in there.
One small step at a time and we should get there soon.
Eric
