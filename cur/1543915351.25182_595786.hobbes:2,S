Hm.  Documentation/mandatory.txt claims that it mandatory locks and
mmap() with MAP_SHARED exclude each other, but I can't see where that's
enfoced.  That file doesn't make any mention of the above race.
So for now I think someone should update that file and fcntl(2) to
mention these problems and to recommend rather strongly against using
mandatory locking.
