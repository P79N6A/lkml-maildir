Add some debuging output to the program (mainly at the very begining of
main) and then launch it with simple program that will note time right
before it forks and then wait for the application to output something
(which should be the debuging write at the start od main) and note time
it returned from select.

Please, could someone explain to me, what is desktop enviroment in
addition to window manager and horde of libraries for UI and IPC.
(No, panel is not important thing and even if it were, it's a simple
fast application, providing it's implemented sanely (I mean, gnome panel
is currently buggy))

No, it does not.
