I wonder sometimes.   With a 16 way cluster practically any tool will
work and not give you problems.  I don't think many of the tools have
progressed beyond the make it work stage, and into polish yet.

The rule is to communicate as little as possible.  Because even if you
have a very low latency interconnect, with insane amounts of
bandwidth, it is needed for your application, not for cluster
management services.

A cluster with 960 compute nodes (each 2way) is being built for
Lawrence Livermore National Lab.  
http://www.llnl.gov/linux/mcr/.
The insane part is the Lustre filesystem is going to be a 32 Node
cluster in and of itself.
So there will be experience out there.
