libevent provides file descriptor without any additional info about it -
so when it is added into the waiting subsystem, userspace must select
different usage cases (i.e. different kevent notifications for different
types of file descriptor - socket notifications for sockets and pipes,
poll/select for all others), this requires stat() call per provided file
descriptor.
Event addition/waiting itself is the same - only parameters (type and
requested event) are changed.
