Actually, I noticed that the tracer patch applied with fewer offsets
(i.e. "more cleanly," in a sense) with the lockdep-combo patch applied
first, so I did that.
I'm doing building the kernel, but I haven't been able to boot it yet:
This system boots the kernel off floppy disks, and under
2.6.17-rc5-mm2, the floppy drive no longer works! The disk spins but
the kernel can't read any of the disk's sectors, even for other
known-working floppies. I'll have to boot back into 2.6.17-rc4-mm3
before I can copy the new kernel onto a disk and boot from it. That
will take me a couple of minutes, although I have to go to school in
under an hour so I might not get to it until later today.
Oh, wait, let me try a sadistic experiment first: Let's see if I can
format a floppy disk with the floppy drive in this non-functioning
state... no, "/dev/fd0: Read-only file system", 100% reproducible.
