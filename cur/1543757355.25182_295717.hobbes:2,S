Yes, I pretty sure some video cards did that in the past at least, and
maybe some scsi cards. It was a while ago, I don't know if this is still
true, but it's relatively easy to do, let's just hide all of this logic,
along with size & signature checking in a single place, that way, we
don't have to duplicate all that logic in drivers...
