Isn't there a more general problem, though? (I hope I'm wrong)
You want to update the CVS tree near-realtime. However, the longest-path
through your graph may change with new merges, but CVS of course cannot
cope with already committed data changing (already committed csets may 
all of a sudden not be in the longest path anymore)? This is a CVS 
limitation, of course, but still a problem AFAICS.
