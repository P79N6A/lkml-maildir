This is because of the RSB (Return Stack Buffer) introduced with the
P5/MMX time.  It predicts return addresses, but doing a push/ret
sequence can totally mess up the prediction stack.

Ok.

Perhaps this change only makes sense if the out-of-line case ever
returns without scheduling.  I'm not sure if it does (but I can think of
a few tricks where that would be useful).  If it always schedules the
RSB mispredication overhead is still there and you've added a bit more
overhead.  Though for some cases of semaphore contention I guess the RSB
could be right despite scheduling.
