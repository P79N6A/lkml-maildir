Subject: [2.5.13] initrd broken again

Initrd was working from 2.5.(9,10?) till 2.5.12-dj. But 2.5.13 (even -dj1)
is doing exactly the same thing as earlier kernels (loading initrd, then
freeing initrd memory and panic: cannot mount root). I've checked
patch-2.5.13.gz but i cannot see anything that could make this dumb issue.
Waiting for reply as soon as it's possible, I have to test one more issue
that could probably happen on 2.5.13 :)
