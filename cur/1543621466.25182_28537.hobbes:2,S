I have to call bullshit on this one! :)
The kernel is always getting some module replaced by some other
module.  Everything from the VM to the recent ALSA merge that
will kill OSS.  This is not to claim it's always a good thing,
just that you can't claim this is not what kernel programmers do...
Hell, we gotta be some of the most egotistical folks around,
it's what keeps us going!
