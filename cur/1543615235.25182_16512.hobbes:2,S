I'd say it's the same even if you DO trigger undefined behavior.
"Undefined" means "anything can happen, don't blame the compiler".  In
particular, different things may happen at different times, under
different compilers, under different phases of the moon, etc...
The change from strcpy to memcpy either replaces a defined action by
the equivalent one, or replaces an undefined action by an undefined
action.  In the undefined case, the outcome may be different after the
change, but that's perfectly ok, that's what "undefined" means.
It might be interesting for the compiler to warn about this coding
error (since it presumably can detect it).  But "fixing" the behavior
of undefined code seems like a strange thing to do.
