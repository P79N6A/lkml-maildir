I reported this problem with 2.4.0-test2. The tulip is recognized during
bootup, but when I login, the ifconfig command shows nothing for eth0.
So, I executed this, which makes the eth0 device look like it did with
2.3.99-pre3:
ifconfig eth0 208.181.28.36 netmask 255.255.255.128 -trailers
After doing this, dhcpcd still refuses to work. If I do the following:
route add default gw 208.181.28.254
It becomes possible to ping, nslookup, etc.
