I guess I didn't spend enough time on it the first time. I tried
again on the weekend and this is what I found, I hope it eliminates
some of the ambiguity:
Pass-through works fine. Both backpack and printer keep working,
even simultaneously. The reason I thought lp died is that pcd in
4bit mode is not only very slow itself - it makes the whole
system extremely unresponsive for as long as the CDROM is being
accessed. E.g. the text console takes five seconds to echo back
characters, the X screen is refreshed in stripes of about 10
pixels high every 30 seconds, etc. Printing graphics stuff may
just pause for five of minutes or so (provided the CDROM access
goes on for that long).

I haven't tried that but I suppose it would change anything.
The bad performance of pcd is there whether lp is loaded or not.
I guess my real problem here is to get pcd use a better mode. I
tried both EPP and ECP, I fiddled with lines like "options pcd
drive0=,,,x,," in conf.modules, to no avail. A different nice
value gives some slight relief for the rest of the system. The
funny thing is I saw it using a higher mode (I thing EPP 8bit,
or so) back when running a 2.1.7x kernel. I reverted back to
2.0.3x for a while and only came back recently to the advanced
parallel port stuff in 2.2.5.
Pcd actually seems to be probing other modes:
paride: version 1.04 installed
paride: bpck registered as protocol 0
pcd: pcd version 1.07, major 46, nice 0
pcd0: 0x378 is parport0
pcd0: bpck: 0x378 unit 1 mode 0:1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
pcd0: bpck: 0x378 unit 1 mode 1:19 19 19 19 1 9 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19 19
pcd0: bpck: 0x378 unit 1 mode 2:-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
pcd0: bpck: 0x378 unit 1 mode 3:-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
pcd0: bpck: 0x378 unit 1 mode 4:-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1
pcd0: Sharing parport0 at 0x378
pcd0: bpck 1.02, backpack 17416601 unit 1 at 0x378, mode 0 (4-bit), delay 4
pcd0: Reset (1) signature =   1  1  1 14 eb
pcd0: identify: Read 36 bytes
pcd0: Master: CDD-820     ERi
(Slightly edited to avoid overly long lines)
The only thing that changed since the 2.1.7x times (apart from
the kernel of course) is the CDROM drive itself. I swapped the
(excellent) Sony CDU77E (4x) for a supposedly faster (but
crappy) 8x drive. Could that be the problem?
Sorry for the long rant,
thanks
Steffen.
