Not only is it simpler code-wise, but it is more to the point... it is 
CONFIG_XEN that needs to be fixed to handle PREEMPT, KEXEC, different HZ 
values, etc.  Not the other way around.
Enabling the compile of any paravirt-ops backend shouldn't cripple the 
kernel in any way... instead, the burden should be on the xen 
paravirt-ops backend to be completed.  CONFIG_PREEMPT shouldn't care 
about which paravirt-ops are compiled in.  Instead, CONFIG_XEN is the 
one that needs !PREEMPT.
