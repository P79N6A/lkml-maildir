No.  I guess it'll have to resemble the other code.

I can do it.  You haven't made any changes to this part of the code, 
have you?  My work tends to be based on Linus's tree, not -mm.
Something to watch out for: With all the extra locking, we run the risk
of blocking the keventd workqueue.  This may or may not matter, but to
be safe perhaps there should be a new general-purpose workqueue which
_expects_ to block (or freeze) during suspends.  Any work routine that 
involves adding or removing a device should go on the new workqueue.

Yes, they are all similar enough that there isn't much point keeping 
them separate.
