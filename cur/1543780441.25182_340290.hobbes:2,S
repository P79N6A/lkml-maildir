You are building only your application with -fno-omit-frame-pointer,
libraries you are using are just used as is.  On 32bit x86 it works
as -O2 on x86 does not imply -fomit-frame-pointer, as frame pointer
is required (well, was) for debugging.  On x86-64 frame pointer is
not needed for debugging as it was always using DWARF debug info,
and so -O2 on x86-64 implies -fomit-frame-pointer.  Due to this most
of libraries you'll find on your 64bit system are built without frame
pointer.  Mandrake either explicitly asks for -fno-omit-frame-pointer,
or maybe their glibc is just sufficiently different that their sleep()
does not need %rbp for sleep().
Loading their glibc to the debugger and inspecting sleep & nanosleep
will reveal whether %rbp is just unchanged by these (and so it works
due to luck), or whether their sleep uses pushq %rbp; movq %rsp,%rbp
- in which case they built glibc with frame pointers for no apparent
reason.
You must use debugging informations to get stacktrace on x86-64.
Blindly following %rbp does not work on this architecture (and lot
of others).
