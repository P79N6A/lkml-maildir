Kill it. Install podfuk and use
cat /mnt/file#cr to convert it from dos and
cat /etc/passwd#crlf > /mnt/file to convert it to dos.
If this is too inconvient, I guess few lines of C code into libvfs is
enough to do this kind of translation in userspace [I'm not going to
write them], so you could actually
cd /mnt#dos_brain_damage/ and see all files magically converted. You
could even implement /mnt#dos_brain_damage:txt,doc,c,pas/ if you
wanted to.
