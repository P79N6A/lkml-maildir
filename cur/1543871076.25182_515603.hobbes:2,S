could you try 's2ram' from 
http://suspend.sf.net
 ? It's basically 
equivalent to 'echo mem > /sys/power/state', but you can usually also 
see the reason why it doesnt resume, on the vga console. (by default the 
kernel doesnt resume the t60's vga properly)
on my box resume works, but it's incredibly slow. Takes a few minutes to 
have total effect.
