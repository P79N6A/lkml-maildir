you can say about the BP6 what you want but it appears that there are
(if your vision is right) many other low end SMP boards categorized
trash. there has been one mistake with it and that's the capacitor
behind a regulator that may have been mis-dimentioned due to the
partchange of that particular capacitor.
my 2.2 kernel running on the BP6 proves that it may work very well,
unless you think that uptimes of > 40 days is bad.
