But IRIX seems to be monolithic and handles realtime content quite well.

there seems to be some discrepancy about what is better uKernel or monolithic,
certainly it's easier to do RT stuff on a uKernel because all drivers run as
processes, but I think it's not impossible to archieve similar results on
monolithic kernels.
Yes, you have to deal with spinlocking and related stuff, but you get the 
added bonus of less syscall overhead, which is in some cases 3 to 10 times
bigger on uKernels. ( read on the L4 for Linux papers).
Could maybe one solution to port all the Linux device drives to the L4 for
Linux  uKernel ?
Actually on L4 for Linux the kernel runs as a single big server, and therefore
these big scheduling latency problems would not go away, until you port
every device driver to L4 IMHO. (correct me if I'm wrong).
The L4 folks benchmarked L4 for Linux and this uKernel runs only
about 6-7% slower than a standard Linux kernel which is not so much.
I would be happy to sacrifice 6-7% of performance to have a kernel
with good RT features.

I agree, QNX is certainly better than Linux for doing RT stuff, becuase of its
uKernel nature, but consider the fact that Linux has the advantage of 
having big developer and commercial interest, this means lots of hardware
supported, and you don't have to pay licensing fees.
As for RT Linux: RT-Linux is certainly excellent to do specialized things,
like robotics etc. , but for general purpose multimeda, RT Linux will not help,
becuase you can't call syscalls in your RT Linux processes, you can only 
use shared mem to communicate with the outside world or use specialized
kernel modules which do custiom I/O.
