No interrupts. BIOS calls work on some machines, but I'd like this to
work when bios does not.
Actually, matthieu's code is probably better to start from:
+/* one ISA cycle @8Mhz */
+#define PAUSE outb %al, $0x80
+#define WAIT_100MS \
+       movl $800000, %eax; \
+       2: \
+       PAUSE; \
+       dec %eax; \
+       jne 2b
+
+/* What's the PIT rate */
+#define COUNT 0xf89
 #define BEEP \
-       inb     $97, %al;       \
-       outb    %al, $0x80;     \
-       movb    $3, %al;        \
-       outb    %al, $97;       \
-       outb    %al, $0x80;     \
-       movb    $-74, %al;      \
-       outb    %al, $67;       \

-       outb    %al, $66;

+       outb    %al, $0x61;     \
+       PAUSE;  \

+       WAIT_100MS; \

+       inb             $0x61, %al;     \

+       andb    $0xFC, %al; \
+       outb    %al, $0x61; \
+       WAIT_100MS
