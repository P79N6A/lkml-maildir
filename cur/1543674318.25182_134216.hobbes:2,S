First, is there anything in include/asm that is actually needed
outside the kernel itself? There shouldn't be, and if there is,
it needs to be moved to a header under include/linux that is
included in the relevant include/asm file.
Assuming that has been done, the first step in making this
change would be to create the directory all this is to go into.
Any suggestions ???
My suggestion would be to move the current headers to a new
directory and put the public headers in their place. This
would produce the following include directory layout:
 * include/linux/    The "sanitised" header files that are
                     safe for use by external software.
 * include/kernel/   Versions of those header files that are
                     used by the kernel, each including the
                     relevant sanitised header files.
 * include/asm/      Header files used only by the kernel,
                     all including the relevant sanitised
                     header files.
The basic rule would be that external software can make free
use of headers under include/linux but should never make any
use whatsoever of headers under include/kernel or include/asm
for any reason.
If anything external to the kernel needs to refer to something
only defined under include/kernel/ then they should report that
here for consideration as something needing a sanitised version
and we could thus ensure that any oversights were dealt with.

Personally, I'm of the opinion that this will only be resolved
when somebody sits down and just does it as they see fit.

I personally can't see the point of that.

The only way I can see this ever being done is one header at a time.
I'm willing to have a go at doing this along the lines of the above
scheme, and the first patch would be one to create the directory
with a set of empty files therein.
Best wishes from Riley.
