Nathan Scott,
I'm very sorry; I don't have the output anymore.  By annihilated I mean 
that there were several directories trees that /didn't work/.  If you 
tried to cd into the directory or take a directory listing... or used a 
file that you knew was in these certain directories then you'd get pages 
of debug message to the console; and no usable data.  I re-ran 
xfs_repair and retried several times but the condition never seemed to 
improve or get worse for that matter.
I /incorrectly/ figured it was a known issue or I'd have saved the 
output.  Sorry again.
