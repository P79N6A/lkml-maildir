That fixes it, but by reducing granularity ctx is up 4-fold.
Mind you, it does have an enormous effect on responsiveness, as negative nice 
with small granularity can't hijack the system any more.

Looks great.  Thanks!

Correct; that's why I always boot into /bin/sh to get a clean run.  But 
redirecting output to a file is also a good idea, provided that this file 
lives on something like tmpfs, otherwise you'll get flush out jitter.

The thing is, this unpredictability seems to exist even at nice level 0, but 
the smaller granularity covers it all up.  It occasionally exhibits itself 
as hick-ups during transient heavy workload flux.  But it's not easily 
reproducible.
Thanks!
