Hi,
I am interested in knowing how mangling the name of symbols
exported by the kernel to include the checksum of the information related to 
that symbol is done, whenever MOD VERSIONS
is used for building a module. Is there any documentation on the
process of the checksum computation, and which portion of the linux
sources I need to go through to understand this ?
TIA.
regards,
Kumar
