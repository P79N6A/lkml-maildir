Please, spare me the rhetoric.
Adding a new locking primitive is a big deal.  We need good reasons for
doing it.  And no, I don't think a few cycles on ARM is good enough.  I'd
be very surprised if it was measurable - the busiest semaphore is probably
i_sem and when it's taken we're also doing heavy filesystem operations
which would swamp any benefit.  And if we're going to churn i_sem then we
perhaps should turn it into an rwsem so we can perform concurrent lookups
(at least).  We do disk I/O with that thing held.
Look, I'm not wildly against mutexes - it's not exactly a large amount of
code.  I just think they're fairly pointless and I regret that we seem to
be diving into adding yet another locking primitive without having fully
investigated improving the existing one.
