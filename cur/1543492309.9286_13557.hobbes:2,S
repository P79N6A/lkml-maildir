When I do get these messages bad things do seem to happen.  ie. compilations
die, sometime the machine even locks up completely.  These messages are almost
always triggered during some combination of heavy load and disk i/o.  And once
done, DMA remains disabled on all drives on the affected IDE channel.  I would
get this with the vanilla 2.2 kernels quite often with very little
encouragement.  The Unified UDMA patch helps quite a bit but does not solve the
problem.  I end up manually disabling DMA at boot to preserve my sanity.
I used to think that it was my chipset(VIA MVP3 on an FIC PA-2013).  But seeing
someone with a BX chipset have these problems has caused my renewed interest.
