I am facing following pbms after installing 2.2.0-final,everything

1. PPP error (message log)

This error appears randomly, I could't figure out the situation.
PPP is compiled into kernel.
1.2 After PPP connection, surfing is too slow (56K connection, atmost
    on an average I am getting 1.6K/s conn. speed!!!)

2. Sound card error
Modprobe message
-----------------
Jan 24 18:07:44 suvanika kernel: sb_card: I/O, IRQ, and DMA are
mandatory

                sound-service-0-0       
I am having ESS1867 Chip (chip version may be wrong, sorry for my
poor memory), I choose OSS sound modules with 100% sb compatible chip
and no low level drivers, but I don't see sb_ess.o driver in modules
directory?, Please help me to load ess drivers.
    
/etc/conf.modules setup (same as 2.0.36)

alias net-pf-4 off 
alias net-pf-5 off
      - added newly, otherwise net-pf-4(5) unresolved symbol error
        appears. But don't know what is this means, any one - please
        point me to the right resource.

3. LILO error
  Under 2.0.36 kernel 'lilo' never showed-up any error, I used to
have lilo color installed with 4 entries, 3 for linux and one for
win98. Now everything gone, lilo complains: device 0303 has starting
cylinder > 1024, I tried linear and I tried installing lilo in
/dev/hda1 (I don't have win98 anymore), nothing helped me.
Even when I say boot=/dev/hda1 and root=/dev/hda1, lilo complains
the 0303 has starting cylinder > 1024. Don't understand at all.
[Help is badly needed, I recommended my friend to install linux in
his new PC, I don't want him to face this pbm in the beginning!]
Only diff I can see is /boot/boot.b size is around 4056 bytes, under
2.0.36 it was just 512 bytes. My kernel is bzImage, I can't make
zImage anymore, only slip and ppp are compiled with kernel.
If only Boot Manager can help me, please recommend a good BM.
I personally feel atleast one good BM should be bundled with
linux distribution and installation should automatically install
lilo or BM depending upon the situation?
4. root filesystem is not unmounted while rebooting
Thank you in advance for your help
