It's actually not hard to "fix", and nfsd would look a little less weird. But 
what would this add, what do pathnames mean in the context of nfsd, and would 
nfsd actually become less weird?
On the wire, nfs transmits file handles, not filenames. The file handle 
usually contains the inode numbers of the file and the containing directory.
The code in fs/exportfs/expfs.c:find_exported_dentry() shows that fh_verify() 
should return a dentry that may be connected or not, depending on the export 
options and whether it's a file or directory. Together with the vfsmount from 
the svc_export, we could compute a pathname.
But there is no way to tell different hardlinks to the same inode in the same 
directory from each other (both the file and directory inode are the same), 
and depending on the export options, we may or may not be able to distinguish 
different hardlinks across directories.
If the nohide or crossmnt export options are used, we might run into similar 
aliasing issues with mounts (I'm not sure about this).
So we could compute pathnames, but they wouldn't be very meaningful. Instead 
of going that way, it seems more reasonable to not do pathname based access 
control for the kernel kernel nfsd at all. Passing NULL as the vfsmounts does 
that. With a properly configured nfsd, the areas that remote users could 
access would still be well confined.
The focus with this whole pathname based security stuff really is to be able 
to better confine local processes. The kernel nfsd is a kernel thread, and as 
such, confining it from a security point of view cannot really work, anyway.

Note that you can still pass a NULL vfsmount in a struct path.
Thanks,
