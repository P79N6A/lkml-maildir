Hi !
I have some troubles with APM, on a kernel that i compile on my own. I have tried many diferrent configurations, but my computer hangs when starting APM.
There are no such troubles when I use kernel which was made when I have installed RH Linux as "workstation". I want to study configuration of kernel that RH 
makes when beeing installed. Can anyone tell me where can I find configuration description of such kernel? Perhaps You can send me a config file?
Thanks.
