This was a result of reverting the multi-mode code back to pre-2.1.122.
Edit ./drivers/block/ide-disk.c and change a stub from 1 to 0.
You will finde it near the bottom of the file.
Or get "Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.19" at the URL
below that a config option.  '2.2.1.uniform-ide-6.19.patch.gz'

The current driver 0.01 is very limited.

Version 0.03 will autotune the host-adapter against the BIOS settings and
the drive's capablities.  Read more about how to assign FIFO sizes between
the two hwif's.  Default should be equal.

There are about four/five flavors of this animal and v0.03 will safely
handle two/three.  Since they all use the same ID and only vary the
revision to distigush between releases.  It is hard because detection
needs to split revision for init-code in ide-pci.c and not in the chipset
driver code.
I am still pondering the bestway to attempt this do the vast amount of
missing information that I would need to secure.
