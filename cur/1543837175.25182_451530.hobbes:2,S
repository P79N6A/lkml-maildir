Actually, there's still a problem. An added device could still 
overlap with a previously added device and not be detected. 
We should keep the devices in order, and check that the region
fits in between the last and the next device.  So, for example,
the following will make the latest patch accept an invalid region:
First, add maj=x, minor=64-127
Next, add  maj=x, minor=0-63
Next, add  maj=x, minor=32-63
When going to insert the third chardev, the for-loop will catch 
the first elt in the chain, do the bounds-check, and add it
without complaint.  I'll try a patch shortly.
