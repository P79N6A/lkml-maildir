I'm just trying to figure out why :
1) RealPlayer does not skip on my 2.4.20
2) RealPlayer does not skip on my office XP
3) MediaPlayer does not skip on my office XP
Maybe it is more of an application problem.

Try to play with SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT. Last time I checked the kernel
let you set a dma buf for 0.5 up to 1 sec of play (upper limited by 64Kb).
Feeding the sound card with 4Kb writes will make you skip after about 50ms
CPU blackout at 44KHz 16 bit. RealPlayer uses 16Kb feeding chunks that
makes it able to sustain up to 200ms of blackout.
