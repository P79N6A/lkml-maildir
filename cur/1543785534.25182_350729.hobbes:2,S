This is exactly why I switched to Gentoo and use gentoo-sources kernel.
However, keep in mind that when I do 'make oldconfig', more often then now the 
help on new options is insufficient to make a decision on whether or not 
something should be included.
Secondly, I'd love to know exactly what sort of hardware is inside my laptop, 
but funnily enough I find out the chipsets and vendors by running lspci.
