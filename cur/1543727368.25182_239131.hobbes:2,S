I can think of one more:
Assuming that the AES code is not in itself considered derived from
the kernel, I see nothing preventing the source file in the kernel
tree carrying a BSD license.  Obviously, when used with the kernel the
GPL will apply, but anyone would be free to take the AES code and
reuse it under the BSD license.  If, on the other hand, the AES source
in the kernel only carries a GPL license tag, someone looking at it
will not be aware that the code is (possibly) available with less
restrictions form another source.
Anyone who has as a goal to see the GPL cover all code on the planet
will obviously prefer placing the file under the GPL only wherever he
can.  Legally, though, there should be nothing prohibiting a single
file in the Linux tree with a more permissive license.
IANAL, so please correct me if I am fundamentally wrong somewhere.
