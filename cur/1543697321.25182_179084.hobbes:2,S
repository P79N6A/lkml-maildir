Clarrifying more:
Actually race is not directly between dcache_readdir and sysfs_remove_dir but
it is like this
cpu 0						cpu 1
dcache_dir_open()
--> adds the cursor dentry
					sysfs_remove_dir()
					--> list_del_init cursor dentry
dcache_readdir()
--> loops forever on inititalized cursor dentry.
Though all these operations happen under parent's i_sem, but it is dropped 
between ->open() and ->readdir() as both are different calls. 
I think people will also agree that there is no need for sysfs_remove_dir() 
to modify d_subdirs list.
