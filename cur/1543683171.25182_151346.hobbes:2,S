Oh, I see, you violate our license, your license is revoked, and
now you have the write to reverse engineer BK?  Show me the law which 
says that is true.
BK has a command that will take a BK tree and produce pure SCCS files,
there is even a GNU SCCS clone so tell me again you need to go poking
around in BK?
This whole thread is nuts.  First of all, there is no need to do so other
than to try and piss us off.  Second of all, it's completely unrealistic
to think you can reverse engineer it and keep up with our advancements.

And those relationships are available from the command line, using BK 
commands.  In other words, you're just trying to yank my chain.  Give
it a rest or join the rest of the wankers in my procmailrc.  Think about
that, one day you may need something from me and I'll never see your 
request, it will be languishing in /dev/null with the rest of wankers.
