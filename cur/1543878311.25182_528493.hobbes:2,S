Thats the approach of checking two flags at the same time. In that case 
the compiler will generate and "and-immediate" and then a 
"compare-immediate" one branch but .... Yuck.

Then we end up with all these small efficiency differences in all 
the code paths. I'd rather go for optimal performance in a frequently used 
construct like this.
This check is not rare. It is done on every SLAB free and on every 
get_page() and put_page(). Lets do the page flag.
