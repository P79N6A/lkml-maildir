Subject: [sata] new libata-dev-2.6 queue created (AHCI, SATA bridges)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

"libata-dev-2.6" is a new patch queue for SATA features which are under
development, or need additional testing before being deployed into the
upstream-bound libata-2.[46] queues.
It currently contains:
1) A workaround for problems on multiple SATA controllers when using
PATA disks attached via SATA bridges.
2) New driver AHCI.  This should currently be considered a technology
preview or early beta test.  Simply because it is a young driver on
complicated hardware, using a new "FIS-based" delivery method (read:
brand new hotpath), caution is advised.  Do not use in production yet.
I have updated my SATA status page to reflect these updates:

   [PATCH] libata basic detection and errata for PATA->SATA bridges
   
   This patch works around an issue with WD drives (and possibly others) over SiL PATA->SATA Bridges on SATA controllers locking up with transfers > 200 sectors.
