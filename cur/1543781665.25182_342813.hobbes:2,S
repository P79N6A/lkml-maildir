There used to be cases where we used the nvram stuff before kmalloc()
was available. I'll check if this is still the case.

Well... the driver doesn't expect you to boot a different OS while
suspended to disk :)
Regarding caching the data in memory, this is done becaues nvram is
actually a flash on recent machines, and you really want to limit the
number of write cycles to it.
