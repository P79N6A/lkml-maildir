And, umm, what *exactly* would you expect it to do? It's the only process
consuming cpu, and sched_yield() certainly doesn't yield to the idle
task. So it's basically the same as a "for(;;);" program, except it
spends more time in kernel space and schedules faster when something
else needs the cpu.
It's 100% expected behavior.
