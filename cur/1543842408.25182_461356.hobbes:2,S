"could be merged with mainline": why "could"?  What would be the
disadvantages of doing this?
I think having test code like this in mainline is a good idea, particularly
for a subsystem like [kj]probes.
It's a bit regrettable that the code "knows" about particular not-exported,
arch-specific core kernel functions, but I guess those don't change very
often, so we won't be forever patching this module.
