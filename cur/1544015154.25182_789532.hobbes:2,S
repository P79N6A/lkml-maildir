Right. I'm still afraid by that: we'd need to know how to remap the
various keycodes (amiga, atari, i386, mc, sun).  And we'd have to
double the number of keymaps being used.  Maybe I should have given an
example: somebody with one hand would rather not have to move it to
type everything.  That means we should setup a key which, while being
pressed, changes the keys under his hand, e.g. for a left-handed,
putting l under the usual s, k under the usual d, j under the usual
f, etc.  Of course we'd need to do that for all the shift/alt etc.
variations too, thus double the number of keymaps, which may not
possible, or else we'd drop some of them, but which ones?
I'm also afraid of how to plug that into distributions.  Console
keyboard setup seemed to me quite heterogeous among distributions
already.  (In case somebody wonders, no, a distribution "for disabled
people" is not a good idea, why should disabled people be left with just
one distribution and not have the choice?)

Not exactly: it's not 1-1, as examplified above.
Thanks,
