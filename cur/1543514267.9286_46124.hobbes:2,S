The stuff will be switched to external allocation as soon as the pagecache
changes will settle down. The last obstacle had gone in 2.3.1, so now it's
only a matter of (a) killable kmem_cache (quite possible already done -
several people promised that) _and_ tons of trivial changes in individual
filesystems. The latter is a very good reason to hold this back until the
things will stabilize again. I'm running such thing on one of may boxen
since the last January (ext2 only) and it's pretty stable (I didn't use
kmem_cache_alloc() - just kmalloc()).
