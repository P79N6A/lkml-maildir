<P><FONT size=2>If you can’ｔ read the following, your mailer (MUA) is broken. 
End of story. <BR><BR>ワタシワAndrewデス。</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>With the original poster effectively saying that Linux (and I 
mean the kernel, not just a distro) will not be internationalized due to one or 
two spammers is wrong. International helpers (and generally they <EM>are</EM> 
volunteers) have posted here before, and we should never cut ourselves off from 
70% of the world who do not speak English.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2>ASCII's time is coming to a close, and confusing two issues 
(spam vs ignoring all .jp/double byte&nbsp;mails) is simply wrong (and skirting 
damn close to racism). I'm not going into which MUA is best as I've decided what 
works for me and you'll be a partisan of another choice, and there should always 
be that choice. The real issue is that many MUA's are simply and unspeakably 
difficult wrt HTML (which is how double byte people must communicate with any 
chance of it being read somewhere else) and how they handle languages in 
general. Spam is a different issue, and one that must be addressed but 
separately to languages. This is an English language forum, and substationally 
that should not change, but cutting off particular language speakers just to 
avoid spam or faulty or substandard mailers smacks of avoiding the real 
issue.</FONT></P>
<DIV><FONT size=2>What happens if a Hebrew, Hindi&nbsp;or Russian language 
spammer (or more likely, the English-language spammers that I've nearly 
universally had in the 11 years I've had e-mail) mails here on a regular basis? 
The problem of spam is separate to I18N, and should always be considered so. 
Otherwise, lkml will alienate international developers. As Linus speaks Finnish 
as his first language&nbsp;(which requires different characters than ASCII* 
supports in any case) I shouldn't think this being controversial. Hopefully, the 
mono-linguists amongst us will pipe down and let Linux be truly universal.</DIV>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=2>* ps remember that ASCII is 7 bits (remember VMS?). 
Characters above 129 are defined by whoever defines the platform. Try getting a 
Mac and a PC to agree where <FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>ë or ö appear in 
this space without specifying a particular NLS or using 
Unicode.</FONT></FONT></P></BODY></HTML>
