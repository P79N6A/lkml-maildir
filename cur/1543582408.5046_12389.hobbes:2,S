One of these things must happen:
a. follow the specification, even if that makes code slow and contorted
b. change the specification
c. ignore the specification
d. get rid of the specification
Option "a" will not be accepted around here. Sorry. The best you can
hope for is option "b". Since that is hard work (want to help?) we
often end up not using a specification... hopefully by just not
having one, instead of by ignoring one.
Not saying it doesn't suck to have things undocumented, but at least
you don't have to reverse-engineer a multi-megabyte binary kernel to
find out what is going on.

Syscalls are more stable, but they may be changed after many years
of a transition period. The C library hides some of this from users.

The driver is buggy, unless the TCP maintainer can be convinced
that TCP is buggy. TCP is a big chunk of code that most people use,
while the driver is not so huge or critical.
The TCP maintainers do not seem to be sadistic bastards hell-bent on
breaking your drivers. API changes usually have a good reason.
