alpha allmodconfig:
arch/alpha/oprofile/../../../drivers/oprofile/buffer_sync.c: In function 'sync_buffer':
arch/alpha/oprofile/../../../drivers/oprofile/buffer_sync.c:398: warning: 'offset' may be used uninitialized in this function
make[1]: *** [arch/alpha/oprofile/../../../drivers/oprofile/buffer_sync.o] Error 1                                                    
because stupid gcc thinks that
	lookup_dcookie(mm, s->eip, &offset);
didn't initialise `offset', and arch/alpha is compiled with -Werror.
I'm not sure what to do about that, apart from finding (or building) a
new alpha cross-compiler.
What a PITA.   I do so wish that someone would maintain a suite of
cross-compilers for kernel developers.
