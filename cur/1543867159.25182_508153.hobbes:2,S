Anytime it is non monotonic that's a bug. We've had bugs
like this before, but recently we're doing reasonably well. Of course
there can be always improvements, but in general I don't agree
with your statement, sorry. You can usually rely on it being monotonic,
short of the known limitations (e.g. don't run ntpd) 
Usually it weren't really classical bugs, but more "hardware does
unexpected things under us". x86 hardware is a moving target unfortunately.

ntpd problem is fundamental, nothing will change that. However
it doesn't seem to be a big one in practice.
