I don't like this approach.  The whole point is to ensure safety, and
avoid races that have been found in the past.  This gives a new interface
that could be easily used under the wrong conditions, and breaking
the interface into two pieces looks kinda hackish.  Is there no other
solution?  I looked at this once before and wondered why task_unlock()
is needed to call avc_audit?  audit should be as lock friendly as printk
IMO, and I don't recall seeing any deadlock after short review of it.
But I didn't get much beyond that.  Is it all the flushing that can't
hold task_lock?
thanks,
