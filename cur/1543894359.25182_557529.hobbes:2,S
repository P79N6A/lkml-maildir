No - because this case is covered in GPLv2. Lose the straw-men.

Incorrect. This is, again, covered by the GPLv2. Straw-man argument.

Straw-man. Situation covered by the GPLv2.

But that right has never been guaranteed by the GPL. It might have been the 
*intent* of RMS when he wrote GPLv1 and the *intent* of the FSF when they 
wrote GPLv2, but intent is worth exactly *NOTHING* in the law *UNLESS* that 
intent is spelled out.
Anyway, as I've pointed out before: replace != modify
You can *replace* parts of a program and it will be a modification, you can 
*replace* components of a piece of Hardware and it will be a modification but 
replacing one software component of a device with another is *NOT* a 
modification. Why? Because the hardware hasn't changed at all - the hardware 
is merely there so the software can perform its job. And since you are 
*replacing* the *ENTIRE* piece of software, it isn't a modification of the 
software.

Exactly. However, you are making it about the hardware by making the claim 
that "replacing a program, in its entirety, with another is a modification". 
It isn't. A modification is when you replace or change a *portion* of a 
program. By your logic I could write an operating system that is 100% binary 
compatible with Linux and I'd be *required* to release it under the GPL, 
because, even though it *replaces* Linux, it's still a "modification".
