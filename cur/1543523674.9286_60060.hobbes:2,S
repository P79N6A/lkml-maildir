I've received a few (so far 15) of the following messages after 
boot:
gfp called by non-running (1) task from c011b216!
The message was first logged on the console during boot,
either as part of starting rpc.nfsd (from nfs-utils-0.1.6)
or autofs (RH6.1 autofs-3.1.3-9).
ksysmoops-0.7c gives:
Warning (compare_ksyms_lsmod): module nfs is in lsmod but not in
ksyms, probably no symbols exported
Warning (compare_ksyms_lsmod): module nfsd is in lsmod but not in
ksyms, probably no symbols exportedWarning (compare_ksyms_lsmod):
module vmppuser is in lsmod but not in ksyms, probably no symbols
exported
