A quick look at this looks like this is what I was looking for. I'd need
to review the code in a more detailed aspect but first glance, Yes, this
is what I want.
Now, since High Res-timers and RT seem to go together, what are the
plans for merging these?  If this is indeed what I need, then I'll be
doing it to myself, but if these can merge in the public domain, then I
would say, all the better.
