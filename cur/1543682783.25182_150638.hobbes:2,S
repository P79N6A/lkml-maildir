We know there are still some issues and we need help from people like
you. It's testing from a big enough user population what allows us to
fix things that don't work as expected :-)
If you can, please, keem trying/testing/using the -mm series of the
kernel. Con Kolivas is dedicating a lot of effort on the scheduler
issus, and I wouldn't like this effort to be useless in the end.
Thanks!
