Generally, the goal is to get external modules included into the kernel.
You want to be able to have this functionality and you do not want to 
use SELinux for it.
But instead of working on getting your code into the kernel you are 
requesting that an API making it easier for you to maintain it 
externally comes back.
There are other points in this thread that might or might not warrant 
making LSM modular again, but even though it might sound harsh breaking 
external modules and thereby making people aware that their code should 
get into the kernel is IMHO a positive point.
