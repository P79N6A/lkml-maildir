Point taken; it doesn't burn NUMA-Q, but this probably hits Summit (with
its much more recent APIC and IO-APIC revisions). I don't see why not.
The hardware is there, time to drop in the code to handle it.

Given that almost nothing actually cares what the irq numbers are, it
sounds like a really good idea to encode the node ID in the upper bits
and the vector in the lower bits (SN2 uses cpuid). I'll try it out.
Thanks!
