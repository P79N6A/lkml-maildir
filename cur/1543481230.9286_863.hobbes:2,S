Don't tell me you _like_ interrupted system calls...
Threads change everything. How would you like a new thread
whenever a signal arrives? That could be an alternate fix.

Ha, ha, ha. NO.
As a prototype, maybe. It would be an extraordinary kludge.
It would have all the crappyness of user-space threads and worse.

No, the native NT kernel API is very simple. (it is not Win32)

How about "do it in the best place" instead? Often that place is
a library, but don't get religious about it.
In this case, the kernel API itself could use some adjustments.
Emulating that in userspace is a sick joke.
