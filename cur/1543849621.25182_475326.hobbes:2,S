It's little cleaner than having two pointers. In general, there is a number
of users of dentry-vfsmount pairs in the kernel, and struct path nicely
wraps it.
As to why struct file in particular, and not some other structure, it's
mostly because Al suggested it... "I can give you a dozen examples of
possible users right now - starting with struct file" (from the struct path
thread few days ago.)
