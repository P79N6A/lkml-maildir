I agree, but you dont need a binary format to achieve this. A WELL-DEFINED 
format is sufficient. XML is one of them, one-value-files another one. The 
"fuzzy parsing" only happens because the files try to be friendly for human 
readers.

How much of your CPU time is spent parsing /proc files?

You shouldn't use them in scripts because they are likely to break. That's 
the whole point. At least not when you want to distribute the scripts to 
others. And BTW the one-value-files are much easier to parse for scripts than 
any other solution that I have seen so far, including the current /proc 
interface.
