Well, the patches that are impacted by procfs being configured or not 
are #7 and #8. While the sizes I've sent you are before all patches 
applied vs after all patches applied :-(
So here are the "interesting sizes" - all with CONFIG_PROC_FS unset:
before patch 7:
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
4318757  454484  462848 5236089  4fe579 vmlinux
before patch 8:
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
4318853  454484  462848 5236185  4fe5d9 vmlinux    +96
after patch 8:
4319055  454484  462848 5236387  4fe6a3 vmlinux    +202
The higher difference after patch 8 is because I'm adding the new 
interface blocking_notifier_chain_cond_register() even if CONFIG_PROC_FS 
is not defined. This is to cover the case where msgmni is set through 
the sysctl() syscall (CONFIG_SYSCTL_SYSCALL).
