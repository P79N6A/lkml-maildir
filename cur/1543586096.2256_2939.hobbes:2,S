Padraig,
Real short and simple, use hdX=flash for the slave.
I do not care about the argument anymore over what is ATA and what is CFA.
You read stuff and you believe.  I know that everything is "STORAGE" is a
"BIG FAT LIE".  Everytime I try to expose this fact people lose it.
So if you want to believe that CFA is ATA fine.
I will help you and tell you that CFA is ATA.
Now use the append line and be happy.
I will not change the code because it will break more things.
The append line is the undo.
I can not be clearer.
Regards,
Andre Hedrick
