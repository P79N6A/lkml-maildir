Well, problem is that it takes long even to awake galeon after you
have not used it for few seconds. Disk is utilized by galeon at this
point, and disk-prio + sched-idle should guarantee that when I ask
system to do something, it will do it at max possible performance.

Is there effective way to limit RSS?
