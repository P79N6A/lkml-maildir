Hi, I've also just reproduced the problem on another machine which does
have multiple cpus/node rather than just one cpu/node. The crash
occurs at the same place when I attempt to offline the last cpu in a
node.
But, I agree that somemone else should repro this.  I only have ppc64
machines available to me right now.
