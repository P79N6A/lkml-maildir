"Don't add nothing," is not a colloquialism; it's just bad grammar.  The
meaning is that you must not add no thing, therefore that you must add
something.  It is a common error amongst English speakers, even amongst
those who speak good, but.  :-)
As with spelling errors, corrections of this sort of thing are trivial
and a waste of time.  I'm opposed to patches like that; they add no
value and could be said to remove "character"; if that's important.
Am American vulgarism seems appropriate: get over it.
