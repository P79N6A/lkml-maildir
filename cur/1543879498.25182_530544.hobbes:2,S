Hi Sam,
'make clean' doesn't seem to descend into Documentation/DocBook/.
At least 'make V=1 clean' doesn't show me any references in DocBook.
I guess that this is because DocBook doesn't have anything that
qualifies in obj-y/m/n and subdir-y/m/n.  (?)
Do you have any recommendations for this?
Thanks,
