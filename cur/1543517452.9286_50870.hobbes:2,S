Yes, I read as much as I can. The number is defined by:
MIN(char_count, MIN(tty->ldisc.receive_room(tty), buf_size))
, where:
- char_count = number of characters in the on-board (HW) buffer;
- buf_size = size of the intermediary driver buffer;

The Rocketport driver I have (i.e., the one present in 2.2.13) does _not_
use this function. Probably you have already released a newer driver with
this check. Anyhow, just after I sent the msg to you I figured that out by
looking at n_tty.c.

Yes, I saw that too, just after I sent the msg. Sorry for the unnecessary
questions, and thank you very much for all the detailed answers !!
