 Hello, guys.
 I  generated m16w workaround patch for 2.6.11.6 (by just removing two
lines :-) and set up a page regarding m15w quirk and the workaournd.
I'm planning on updating m15w patch against the vanilla tree until it
gets into the mainline so that impatient users can try out and it gets
more testing.

 Thanks.
