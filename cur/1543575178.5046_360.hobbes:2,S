Yes.  I can only get the SSH crash when I am running remotely from the
house over the internet, and it only shows then when running a build in
jobserver mode (parallel build).  The X problem seems related as well,
since it's related to (usually) NetScape spawing off a forked process. 
I will attempt to recreate tonight, and post the core dump file.
