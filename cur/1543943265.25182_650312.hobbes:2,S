Pretty much all in the right circumstances.
e.g. consider a segment reload in tracked memory.
Also there are various instructions which do all kinds of complicated
things internally; like IRET or INT: often with many memory accesses.
Just page through a instruction manual and look at the pseudo code
describing what the various instructions do.

I would not expect problems from MMX/SSE here (except for the generic
ones all instructions have)
