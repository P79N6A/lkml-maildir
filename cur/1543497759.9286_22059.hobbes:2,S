That's not the issue here, Alan.
We already have the means to install linux on just about memory-limited
all older laptops  -- use a boot floppy with a smaller initrd.
The fancy larger initrd, *if* it's too large for 8MB, is only
needed for the latest boot-from-cdrom systems anyway.
No issue.
Besides all of which, it ain't that hard to create a bootable cdrom
that requires *less* memory for initrd than the current ones!
Just nuke all of the non-cdrom-install crap from the cdrom boot image.
Piece of cake, especially for a place like RedHat or Suse or Caldera.
If not, they can always subcontract the work.  Lots of takers.
Cheers.
