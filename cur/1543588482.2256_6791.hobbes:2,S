Juri, et al.
    I did some searches on google.  It seems that it is the combination 
of kernel 2.4, glibc2.2.x, and possibly the i686 optimizations.  I found 
my machine was alive from a network connection.  The problem is, I cant 
get my keyboard back even with sysrq (syslog does show it changing into 
XLATE mode... I thought alt-ctrl-r was raw?).  Of course the machine was 
alive, but X was dead. xscreensaver and the screen save it ran along 
with most of the desktop stuff was still running.
  Anyway, I tried 'shutdown -r now'over the network. Didn't work.  I had 
to do a hard reset.  So it seems the kernel may be slightly left in an 
unknown or confused state.
I did not compile it myself.  Using RedHat 7.1 standard.
Since I saw this mentioned here recently, does gcc still think 686=cmov? 
If so, Alan or someone else, does Athlon classic (slot 800 Mhz) support 
cmov?
