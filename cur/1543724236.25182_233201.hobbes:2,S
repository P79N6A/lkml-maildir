Hans,
I forgot to mention I am running on Suse 9.1 with 2.6.4 but can upgrade this software 
to 2.6.whatever.  If you could hand me a patch or some instructions as to which files
to modify, I'll attempt to make these changes and test them.  Reiser seems a little more
complex than most of the other FS's and I am somewhat hesitant to alter it and place 
it into a production system based on a lot of bug reports I;ve seen over the years.  It's 
very powerful, but also very complex and I probably **WILL** break something if I 
attempt to change your code.  Can you point me to where the changes and/or send 
me a simple patch to remove the 32000 directory limitation and increase support to 32
bit the the nlink field?
Danke,
Jeff

I was actually looking through your code when this message arrived.   I am 
sending out 
another unit Monday to the site installed with reiser and Suse Linux, Might I 
suggest 
perhaps you consider making the change in reiser for the larger field size to 32 
bit (I 
am looking at the code at present, and it appears you are using the same inode 
structure as everyone else) and I will default these systems to reiser instead 
of EXT3 
for this application.  There's another FS (not NWFS) that actually writes the 
captured
network traffic streaming to the system at over 400 MB/S which folks haven't 
seen 
yet, it acts more like on on-disk LRU with huge cache units (137 MB each) 
but snort and the network forensic applications use a standard file system for 
reporting.  Reiser is a good choice if this limitation can be removed.
Veil Erfolg and Gluck.  
Danke,
Jeff
