Hm, I get:
Your mail to 'tpmdd-devel' with the subject
    test only
Is being held until the list moderator can review it for approval.
The reason it is being held:
    Post by non-member to a members-only list
so what MAINTAINERS usually says in that case is "(subscribers-only)":
L:	linux-atm-general@lists.sourceforge.net (subscribers-only)
Also, the archive shows emails there on APR-30.
