This has nothing to do with the pcmcia support, but with the tulip driver.
The easiest thing to try is to comment away the following code in
tulip/eeprom.c around line 237.
	printk(KERN_INFO "%s:  Index #%d - Media %s (#%d) described "
	   "by a %s (%d) block.\n",
	   dev->name, i, medianame[leaf->media], leaf->media,
	   block_name[leaf->type], leaf->type);
Better yet, download and try the latest tulip driver from sourceforge.net
(search for tulip). I'm sure Jeff Garzik would like to know if it works.
