Note that some of updatedb's metadata pages are of the accessed-often kind, 
e.g., directory blocks and inodes.  A blanket low priority on all the pages 
updatedb touches just won't do.

IMHO, updatedb *should* evict all the "interactive" pages that aren't 
actually doing anything[1].  That way it should run faster, provided of 
course its accessed-once pages are properly given low priority.
I see three page priority levels:
  0 - accessed-never/aged to zero
  1 - accessed-once/just loaded
  2 - accessed-often
with these transitions:
  0 -> 1, if a page is accessed
  1 -> 2, if a page is accessed a second time
  1 -> 0, if a page gets old
  2 -> 0, if a page gets old
The 0 and 1 level pages are on a fifo queue, the 2 level pages are scanned 
clock-wise, relying on the age computation[2].  Eviction candidates are taken 
from the cold end of the 0 level list, unless it is empty, in which case they 
are taken from the 1 level list. In desperation, eviction candidates are 
taken from the 2 level list, i.e., random eviction policy, as opposed to what 
we do now which is to initiate an emergency scan of the active list for new 
inactive candidates - rather like calling a quick board meeting when the 
building is on fire.
Note that the above is only a very slight departure from the current design.  
And by the way, this is just brainstorming, it hasn't reached the 'proposal' 
stage yet.
[1] It would be nice to have a mechanism whereby the evicted 'interactive' 
pages are automatically reloaded when updatedb has finished its work.  This 
is a case of scavenging unused disk bandwidth for something useful, i.e., 
improving the interactive experience.
[2] I much prefer the hot/cold terminology over old/young.  The latter gets 
confusing because a 'high' age is 'young'.  I'd rather think of a high value 
as being 'hot'.
