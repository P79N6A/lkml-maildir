And it works fine.  I've modified LinuxThreads in glibc-2.1.3 to use
it (patch at <
http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dpw/linux/dc/>
).  The remaining
loose end I have to address is to do with the setting the scheduling
parameters for the newly created thread specified in the call the
pthread_create().  (The scheduling parameters need to be set by the
time pthread_create() returns, and also by the time the new thread's
start function gets called.  This can be solved by calling
sched_setscheduler() both in the parent thread and the child thread,
but then both threads need to wait until the other one has finished
making the call, and the two sched_setscheduler() syscalls tend to
contend with each other on SMP, so the performance isn't wonderful.)

POSIX says that any thread can do a wait() et al. for a child process.
But Linux currently thinks that a child processes is a child of a
particular thread, and so only that thread can wait() for it.
