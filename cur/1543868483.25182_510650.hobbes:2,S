I see, thanks... thaw_process() doesn't take TIF_FREEZE into account.
But doesn't this mean we have a race?
Suppose that try_to_freeze_tasks() failed. It does cancel_freezing() for each
process before return, but what if some thread already checked TIF_FREEZE and
(for simplicity) it is preempted before frozen_process() in refrigerator().
thaw_tasks() runs, ignores this task (P), returns. P gets CPU, and becomes
frozen, but nobody will thaw it.
No?
Oleg.
