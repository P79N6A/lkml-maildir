I had exactly the same problem on my HP e800.  I've tried to identify
what had changed between 2.4.10 and 2.4.11 in IO-APIC code, and I've
found out that probably the only change relevant to my uniprocessor
case is the change of the initial value of dest_mode field in struct
IO_APIC_route_entry in setup_IO_APIC_irqs() and
setup_ExtINT_IRQ0_pin() in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c from 1 to macro
INT_DELIVERY_MODE, which for uniprocessors was defined to be 0.
I don't claim I understand whether it is right or wrong, but the
following patch can fix _my_ problem:
--- linux/include/asm-i386/smp.h.int_delivery	Wed Oct 10 13:36:11 2001
+++ linux/include/asm-i386/smp.h	Wed Oct 10 18:17:06 2001
