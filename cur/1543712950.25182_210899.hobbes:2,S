That interpretation makes pretty much zero sense.
If you care about the data hitting the disk, you have to use fsync() or 
similar _anyway_, and pretending anything else is just bogus.
As such, just marking the pages dirty is as much of a "queing" them for 
write as actually writing them, since in both cases the guarantees are 
_exactly_ the same: the pages have not hit the disk by the time the system 
call returns, but will hit the disk at some time in the future.
Having the requirement that it is on some sw-only request queue is
nonsensical, since such a queue is totally invisible from a user
perspective.
User space has no idea about "block device layer" vs "VM layer" queues,
and trying to distinguiosh between the two is madness. It's just an 
internal implementation issue that has no meaning to the user.
