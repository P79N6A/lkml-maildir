Sure poll() cannot return a partial count, since its return value is :
On success, a positive number is returned, where the number returned is
        the  number  of structures which have non-zero revents fields (in other
        words, those descriptors with events or errors reported).
poll() is non destructive (it doesnt change any state into kernel). Returning 
EFAULT in case of an error in the very last bit of user area is mandatory.
On the contrary :
epoll_wait() does return a count of transfered events, and update some state 
in kernel (it consume Edge Trigered events : They can be lost forever if not 
reported to user)
So epoll_wait() is much more like read(), that also updates file state in 
kernel (current file position)
