You're half-right. On a 2.1.x or 2.2.x kernel the disk performs about the
same with or without rc5des, but on the 2.0.x kernels it does make a big
difference. At least I've always found this to be so on my system with
IDE/UDMA drives.
The moral of the story would seem to be to run 2.2.x if you want fast disk
transfers on a busy system...
