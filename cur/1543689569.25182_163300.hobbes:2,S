No, it can instead replace much of it with a better infrastructure as
can ATA over ethernet. Or you can push the whole problem up to fs level
and you get stuff like LUSTRE

Which is a strange place to put a Linux box but I guess you might want
to build a legacy SCSI raid box that way as opposed to iSCSI.

You need to add target support to some of the drivers and probably a
chunk of infrastructure as well. I suspect someone did the job for BSD
and since its pretty rarely needed and its normally in a closed box
where the core OS being Linux doesn't matter everyone else just used BSD
for that job.
