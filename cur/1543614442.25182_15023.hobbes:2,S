Subject: (v)sscanf handles %i improperly (+patch)

I found (v)sscanf included in last kernels handles %i format improperly. 
Currently, up to 2.4.17, %i is handled identical to %d. However, 
accordingly to man for sscanf,
       i      Matches an  optionally  signed  integer;  the  next
              pointer  must  be a pointer to int.  The integer is
              read in base 16 if it begins with `0x' or `0X',  in
              base 8 if it begins with `0', and in base 10 other­
              wise.  Only characters that correspond to the  base
              are used.

Patch is quite small (against 2.4.17):
