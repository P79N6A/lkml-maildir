I don't think I made the claim that this was a benchmark -- I certainly
realize that "make -j bzImage" is not real-world, but it is clearly
indicative of heavy VM/CPU/context load.  Since I don't believe this
patch is currently in the running for inclusion, I'm just giving general
feedback to the patch author rather than making a case.
For instance, "make -j bzImage" reproduced the ext3 bug that Andrew
found where my other VM-intensive apps did not.  I doubt we should keep
the bug in the kernel because the situation isn't real-world enough.
But yes, a bug is worse than a behavior flaw, granted.
