Agreed (I've had to fix the iorl patch 3 or 4 times for things that
weren't bugs in the iorl patch until mainline got updated with a new
lock somewhere or things like that).

>From my standpoint, we are going to be maintaining our 2.4 kernel RPMs
for a long time, so my preference is to have it in mainline.  On top of
the performance stuff I have also been building some actual bug fix
patches.  They depend on the behavior of the patched kernels, and in
some cases would be difficult to put on top of a non-iorl patched scsi
stack.  In any case, my current plans include putting my 2.4 scsi stack
stuff up for perusal on linux-scsi.bkbits.net/scsi-dledford-2.4 as soon
as I can sort through the patches and break them into small pieces.
