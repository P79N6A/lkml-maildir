If X is hung and not accepting data on any of its sockets, then this
could hang the Xterm in the background, and therefore hang the printout
from the "date" process.  What happens if you do this?
Switch to VT 1:
# while true; do date; sleep 1; done
Switch to X and trigger hang
Switch back to VT 1 and look at output
Cheers,
