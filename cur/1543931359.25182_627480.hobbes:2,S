Well, the spec says that those reserved fields "should be zero". Unfortunately, people seem to have read this in the IETF sense and not as "the fields MUST be zero". I.e. I've seen cards where reserved fields contain junk.

The EXT_CSD is read after the CID, so add some table that maps certain workarounds to specific cards. Then add some bit saying "is really EXT_CSD 1.2" and check for that bit when parsing the EXT_CSD.
