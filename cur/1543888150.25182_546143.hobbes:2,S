I compiled it with 2.6.21-mm2 and 2.6.22-rc1 but both of them hangs at 
startup after setting up portmap. So atleast init starts.. I suppose I 
should set up remote syslog to debug.. and ofcourse apply the patch to a 
vanilla 2.6.21, but right now I have a lot to do.
I know at least one other person with the same hardware who also run 
linux, devmnt@gmail.com
, perhaps someone could help him apply the patch if he is williing..
regards Tobias
