Hmm.

Every invocation of the put_char() method should be preceded by a check
to ensure that there is sufficient space in the drivers buffer (via the
drivers write_room() call.)  Could you add a BUG() on this condition
and get some call traces please?

I don't think that should be necessary.  The tty layer is obviously
doing something it shouldn't (trying to stuff characters into a buffer
of zero size) so it should get fixed.
