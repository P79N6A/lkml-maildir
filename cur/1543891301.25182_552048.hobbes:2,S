Whilst it's too early to tell yet, there are a few really nasty bugs
that made it into our final kernel (based on 2.6.21.3).
For eg, a whole class of Dell laptops won't boot unless you boot
with maxcpus=1  I root-caused this to one of tglx's patches that went
into 2.6.21.2, but it's a head-scratcher as to why it's responsible.
I'm praying that this is the worst of the 'cant install' bugs we get,
and then I can just push out a 2.6.22 some time that will magically
make all these problems go away. (Because .22 is going to be flawless right?)

Probably :-)   I've done two successful upgrades yesterday, one with
anaconda, and one using just rpm -U of the fedora-release rpm from F7
and then 'yum update'.  (The former did go a little smoother though tbh).
