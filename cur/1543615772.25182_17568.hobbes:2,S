Yes.  It sounds like he Rick slowed down fork enough the system didn't fall
over.  There may be some other policy changes as well.  But my hunch is that
it is a fork speed thing.  If all that happens is that the system hits
OOM when subjected to an unreasonable load I don't see this as a problem.
The truly interesting question is what happens when you and more swap.
With sufficient swap will it work?
