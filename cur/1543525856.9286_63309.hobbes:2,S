Actually, it is safe to edit .config with a text editor provided
that you do run "make oldconfig" afterwards.
"make oldconfig" reads the current .config and then writes out
a new .config and a new include/linux/autoconf.h.  If you neglect
to run "make oldconfig" then you will get hosed because you will
have stale values in include/linux/autoconf.h.
Just another corner of kbuild that could use some more automation
and documentation (I would like to have "split-include.c" operate
on .config as input and *emit* include/linux/autoconf.h in addition
to the work it does now).
