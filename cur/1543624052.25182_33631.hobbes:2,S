Couldn't find them .
Moved the disks to the old machine, got my RAID back. But I still
can't find the magic numbers for the rais-sb anywhere. 
Could it be that 48bit addressing doesn't work for PIO mode?
Either KERNEL bug, drive bug or by spec?
I found that the drives were horribly slow when I tried searching
them. So I turned DMA on only after having failed to mount the raid,
and started to "search" through the whole disk.
Can someone seek to the 8k before end of a raid-partition, and dump
the remaining part of the disk, so that I can be sure to know what it
looks like? That should include the raid-sb, right?
