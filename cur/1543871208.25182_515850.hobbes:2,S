Subject: [PATCH] initramfs should not depend on CONFIG_BLOCK
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/5/369

initramfs ended up depending on BLOCK:
  INITRAMFS_SOURCE <-- BLK_DEV_INITRD <-- BLOCK
This inhibits use of customized-initramfs-over-ramfs without block layer
(ramfs would still be enabled), useful in embedded applications.
Move BLK_DEV_INITRD out of 'drivers/block/Kconfig' and into 'init/Kconfig',
make it unconditional.
