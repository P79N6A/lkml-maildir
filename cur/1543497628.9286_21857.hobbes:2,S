A couple of weeks ago there was an issue with the Sangoma updates causing
a loss of connectivity after a couple of days. I looked into the sources
and an old release is still in 2.2.9.
Is the current wanpipe stuff working? I am thinking about upgrading a
2.0.35 system to 2.2.X. Wait or go ahead with it? It is the major router
for our campus network. The rest of our linux boxes are already on 2.2.X
and seem to be working fine.
