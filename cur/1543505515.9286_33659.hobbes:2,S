allocate the necessary structs for all pages that are faulted in via
read-ahead -- of course some of that won't result in an allocation, but
simply an extra lookup operation.  see below.

well, not store them (although it could be useful to cache them somehow),
but do the lookup and make sure the memory is allocated while waiting for
the original fault I/O to complete.  in other words, when the page is
finally faulted and mapped, we're sure we do only a lookup, and not an
allocation of any kind.

don't worry, i probably don't know what i'm talking about anyway... :)
i'll try to post a patch soon, that will probably explain a little better.
it's pretty simplistic, but i think it will convey my idea.
