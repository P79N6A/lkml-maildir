I would probably do it by overriding the file_operations.sendfile
function. A first approximation of a possible implementation follows. I
went a bit crazy on the comments. The only problem is that the type of
target is unknown, block/loop.c and nfsd/vfs.c are using sendfile to
to send to something that is not a struct file.

int my_file_sendfile(struct file *in_file, loff_t *ppos, size_t count,
		     read_actor_t actor, void __user *target)
{
    struct file *out_file = NULL;
    /* We have to check the read_actor callback function to see if the
     * target actually points at a struct file. */
    if (actor != file_send_actor)
	goto copy_local;
    /* are both source and destination within the same file system

    if (in_file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_sb != out_file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_sb)
	goto copy_local;
    /* are we copying the entire source file? */
    if (*ppos != 0 || count != in_file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_size)
	goto copy_local;
    /* and are we at least overwriting the complete destination file?
