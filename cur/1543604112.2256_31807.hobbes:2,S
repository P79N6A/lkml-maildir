It could be just fragmentation but the fact it doesn't happen in
non-highmem pretty much shows that shows the memory balancing isn't
doing the right thing, you hide the problem with the infinite loop for
non atomic order 0 allocations and that's just broken, as best it will
be slower in collecting the right pages away.
My approch shouldn't fail so easily in fork despite I'm not looping in
fork either, because I'm trying to do better decisions since the first
place in the memory balancing, I don't wait the infinite loop to
eventually collect away the right pages.
