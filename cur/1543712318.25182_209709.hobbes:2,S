Is all your i/o memory mapped?

Huh? Does it mean that all the accesses are horibly slow?

How do you implement ptrace if apps are protected from kernel?

Well... buggy drivers can usually program DMA to do crashing for them.
How is your architecture called?

That would be pretty big rewrite...
Anyway, I believe you *do* want linux on it, if only as a test load.
