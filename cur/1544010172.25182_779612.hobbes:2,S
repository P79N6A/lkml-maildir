The expression you've chosen here can be quite inacccurate, because
((PAGE_SIZE / (8 * THREAD_SIZE)) is a small number.  The way to
preserve accuracy is
	max_threads = (mempages * PAGE_SIZE) / (8 * THREAD_SIZE);
so how about avoiding the nasty ifdefs and doing

The code is also inaccurate because it assumes that <whatever allocator
is used for threads> will pack the thread_structs into pages with best
possible density, which isn't necessarily the case.  Let's not worry
about that.
OT:
max_threads is widly wrong anyway.
- the caller passes in num_physpages, which includes highmem.  And we
  can't allocate thread structs from highmem.
- num_physpages includes kernel pages and other stuff which can never
  be allocated via the page allocator.
A suitable fix would be to switch the caller to the strangely-named
nr_free_buffer_pages().
If you grep the tree for `num_physpages', you will find a splendid
number of similar bugs.  num_physpages should be unexported, burnt,
deleted, etc.  It's just an invitation to write buggy code.
