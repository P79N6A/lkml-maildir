Yes, but as you said this isn't a power loss event.  It is a hard
reset with a full write cache, which all drives on the market today
respond to by flushing the cache.
According to the spec the time to flush can exceed 30s, so your PSU
better have some honkin caps on it to ensure data integrity when you
yank the power cord out of the wall.
