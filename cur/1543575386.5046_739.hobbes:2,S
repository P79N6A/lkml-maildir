2.2.18-25 with Frame Buffer enabled will frizt and trash LCD displays
on DELL laptop computers when the system kicks into graphics mode,
and attempts to display the penguin images on the screen.  It 
renders the anaconda installer dead in the water when you attempt 
even a text mode install (not graphics) of a 2.2.18-25 kernel (and 24)
on a DELL laptop.  Is there a way to turn on frame buffer without 
kicking the kernel into mode 274 and killing DELL laptops during
a text based install?
Jeff
