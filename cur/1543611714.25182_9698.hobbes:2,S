Hey! It's a pre-patch. There's time before 2.4.17-rc is released.
Having it in a pre-patch is the only way to get decent testing,
unfortunately. Not enough people bother downloading extra patches.
All known issues were resolved before the merge.
And 2.5 isn't going to get a lot of testing until the breakage caused
by the bio changes is fixed. At the moment, I can't even test it
myself.
