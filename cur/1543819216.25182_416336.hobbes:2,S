Hey Stephen,
I have netem enabled in the kernel... I've checked this numerous times.  
I enabled it under Networking Options -> QoS -> Network emulator.  I 
even did a make clean, make mrproper, and rebuilt from scratch.
Maybe I'll try compiling it as a module and see if anything changes.
Any other ideas?

In response to Matt:
Thank you!
One last question, if I take this route, what is the easiest way to 
allow me to change the packet loss without hard coding a percent into 
the kernel?
