It's a side channel timing attack on data-dependent computation through
the L1 and L2 caches.  Nice work.  In-the-wild exploitation is
difficult, though; your timing gets screwed up if you get scheduled away
from your victim, and you don't even know, because you can't tell where
you were scheduled, so on any reasonably busy multiuser system it's not
clear that the attack is practical.
