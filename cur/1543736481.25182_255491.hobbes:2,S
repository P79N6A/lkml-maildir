Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt answers how to do this "right".  In any
case, there's nothing to stop you changing your scripts from
"make install && do_my_special_thing && make modules_install"
to
"make kernel_install && do_my_special_thing && make modules_install"

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
