Please, go ahead and tell me _where_ the conditions for copying and
using such code are been written and why such code licence is different
from map_user_kiobuf. I check the memory.c file in 2.4.19pre5 and
nothing is written about those special restrictions.

such vmalloc_to_page function takes 5 minutes to rewrite, that's not
lots of work in my vocabulary but anyways "how hard the code is to
write" doesn't matter with the rest of the discussion.

What is plain and simple is that since you didn't wrote a single line
about it, there cannot be any licence difference between your
vmalloc_to_page in 2.4.19pre5 and map_user_kiobuf.
Furthmore exposing the function to binary only devices, doesn't mean I
will even link a binary only device with it, and nevertheless I won't
because I don't use binary only drivers, but again this is not the main
topic.
