Linus, please revert commit 21564fd2a3deb48200b595332f9ed4c9f311f2a7
It's not acceptable since illegal modules should definitely not get 
write access to paravirt_ops.
Andi forwarded it although the following people had already NAK'ed it:
- Christoph Hellwig [1]
- Peter Zijlstra [2]
- Alan Cox [3]
Considering that Andi forwarded it 2 days after he himself said a 
different solution was pending [4] I assume he mistakenly sent it for 
inclusion in your tree.
Reverting is safe since it simply re-establishes the 2.6.21 status quo.

        of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
       "Only a promise," Lao Er said.
