Ok, with this explaination, I can believe that this happens. Sorry for my 
first answer, I first took the most likely idea, i.e. the hard disk spins 
down because it's no more used, but the host kernel is still alive and 
kicking, and the hard drive will spin up when needed. Anyway, this 
description, w
You are using a vanilla host kernel (2.6.9), so you have no SKAS patch 
running, i.e. this is a host kernel bug, actually, and it is pretty severe. 
Attach your .config in next email.
Can you please report that (including the kernel panic message) to LKML, 
CC:ing the -devel list? Also, could you try that with different host kernels? 
Different setups? Are you running your UML as root or not? If you are running 
it as root, then try running it with an unprivileged userid.

You mean obiously the "host" system (i.e. the hardware one; "guest" refers to 
the UML instance).

Try to copy and send the text of the panic, (most of the numbers can be 
omitted, even because they are often hard to decode; the list of function 
calls is more important than anything else).
