Some random notes without reading it all carefully...

How can this happen?

This usually done in bus->probe() function, when we know for sure that
driver binds to to the device.

That will for sure raise Greg KH's blood pressure ;)

That should be handled via bus's device attributes and not open coded...

Any particular reason for mangling addresses?

This is scary. spin_lock_irqsave() and be done with it.

Spinlock is not the best choise here, I'd expect most ->open()
implementation wait on some IO.
