In a way it's consistent. mkdir DOES follow symlinks in the part of the path
before the last /, so having adding a / cause following symlinks seems
acceptable.
Notice also that if you do:
mkdir q
ln -s q p
lstatting p gives you info on the symlink, while lstatting p/ gives you info
on the directory
(if you have a non super recent ls you can also see it by comparing
 ls -l p
and
 ls -l p/
)
