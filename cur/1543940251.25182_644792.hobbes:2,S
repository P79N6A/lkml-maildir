All kinds of HW. I mentioned it in the intro email.
Here are the highlights
	HP XW9300 (Dual Opteron NUMA box) and XW9400 (Dual Core Opteron)
	HP DL145 G2 (Dual Opteron) and G3 (Dual Core Opteron)
	Dell Precision workstations (Core2 Duo and Quad) 
	Various Core2 Duo based systems uTCA boards
		Mercury AXA110 (1.5Ghz)
		Concurrent Tech AM110 (2.1Ghz)
This scheme should work on anything that lets you disable SMI on the isolated core(s).

Not accurate enough and way too much overhead for what I need. I know at this point it probably 
sounds like I'm talking BS :). I wish I've released the engine and examples by now. Anyway let 
me just say that SW MAC has crazy tight deadlines with lots of small tasks. Using nanosleep() & 
gettimeofday() is simply not practical. So it's all TSC based with clever time sync logic between
HW and SW.
