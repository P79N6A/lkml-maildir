Alan, the problem is that there _is_ no such instruction as a "call
absolute".
There is only a "call relative" or "call indirect-absolute". So you either
have to indirect through memory or a register, or you have to fix up the
call at link-time.
Yeah, I know it sounds strange, but it makes sense. Absolute calls are
actually very unusual, and using relative calls is _usually_ the right
thing to do. It's only in cases like this that we really want to call a
specific address.
