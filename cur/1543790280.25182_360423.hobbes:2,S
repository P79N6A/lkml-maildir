It's intermittent. It looks like more recent kernels have a tendency
 to trigger it more easily - in fact I just happened to have another
 occurrence, this time without even loading the acx driver, just
 1. boot
 2. login as non-root
 3. startx
 but it works most times.
I lied however - the keyboard is _not_ dead, despite not lighting
 the CapsLock led, and I can Alt-SysRQ-<x>.
Luckily, I have both the current working Xorg.0.log and the one
 coming from the hang. I'm attaching both, and my xorg.conf.
Thanks :)
