I'm not sure if it supports hdds or not, As far as I can see, it basically
rescans for the device you're doing.  I attach the contrib script (comes in
hdparm's source tree but not generally included

I think it would work on all ide chipsets, but i'm not sure.  I have hot
plugged IDE into standard systems and hdds not designed for it.  You do run
a risk of hardware damage which I has never happened for me (but could
happen to me next time I try or it could happen to you.  Be warned).  For
this, I've had a system who's / is not an ide disk (I have a machine
mounting / over nfs) and I load/unload ide modules.
I'd like to see support for this similar to /proc/scsi/scsi to rescan
