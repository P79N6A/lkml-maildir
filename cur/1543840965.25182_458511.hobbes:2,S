Subject: [PATCH 000 of 4] md: Introduction
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Following are 4 patches for md, suitable for 2.6.19.
The first three define "congested_fn" functions for various raid level -
I all just found out about the need for these.  These could address 
responsiveness problems that some people have reported, particularly
while resync is running.
The last improves some messages when resync happens so e.g. it doesn't
like your array is being resynced when you only asked for it to be checked.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
