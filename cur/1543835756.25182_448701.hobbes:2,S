Whatever Postmark does, this looks pretty besides the point.
Are these actual transactions with the "D"urability guarantee?
3000/s doesn't look too much like you're doing synchronous I/O (else
figures around 70/s perhaps 100/s would be more adequate), and cache
exercise is rather irrelevant for databases that manage real (=valuable)
data...
