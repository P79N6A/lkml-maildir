It is a compiler mistake... the compiler clobbers another register for
you. The compiler does not, however, know about timing issues with the
contents of the inline assembly... otherwise it'd stick a delay in front of
the XADD in my stuff.

*grin* Fun ain't it... Try it on a dual athlon or P4 and the answer may come
out differently.
