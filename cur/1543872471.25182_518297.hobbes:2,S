Thanks Parav, adding singal_allow(SIGALRM) wakeup the blocking
interruptible_sleep_on and checking the signal_pending would return
true now. But a quick question is when detecting signal_pending, I
return -ERESTARTSYS, but the user process receive the return value of
ioctl call is -1, shouldn't it be -4 for EINTR?
Thanks all for the responses,
