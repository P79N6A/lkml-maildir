Well that would very much depend on what you're changing.  For example,
if it is a file system modification, then use file system benchmarks.
However, those same benchmarks would not be appropriate for changes in
the network stack.  A pre-written benchmark may not even exist.  You
should use your knowledge of what you are changing to choose an
appropriate benchmark that will stress that part of the kernel.
