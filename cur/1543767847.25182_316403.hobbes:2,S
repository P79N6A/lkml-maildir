This function exists only for i386. Today for smp suspend they are using
cpu hotplug code, but since i386 startup code is not like
true smp bringup, so there is this hack to prepare something before calling
__cpu_up().
This is just to provide a default implementation, in the case arch
doesnt provide a smp_prepare_cpu(). 
Hope i answered the right question, unless you have something subtle here :-(
