You can take it out again later on - most people's .configs will then have
E1000E set.   People who still do `cp ancientconfig .config ; make oldconfig'
remain screwed.
I dunno.  I guess I'm not into causing people pain in an attempt to train
them to do what we want.  This is a popular driver and a *lot* of people
are going to:
- build new kernel
- install new kernel
- find it doesn't work, go through quite large amounts of hassle trying
  to work out why it stopped working.  Eventually work out that e1000
  stopped working.  Eventually work out that it stopped working because we
  forcibly switched them to a new driver which they didn't know about.
- reconfigure kernel
- rebuild, reinstall
Multiply that by 100s of people (at least).  All because Jeff wouldn't
apply a one-liner?
