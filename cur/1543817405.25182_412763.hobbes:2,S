Point of clarification:  The original SELinux prototype NSA released in
Dec 2000 based on Linux 2.2.x kernels was a proof-of-concept reference
implementation.  I wouldn't describe the current implementation in
mainline Linux 2.6 and certain distributions in the same manner.  Also,
the separate Q&A about "did you try to fix any vulnerabilities" is just
saying that NSA did not perform a thorough code audit of the entire
Linux kernel; we just implemented the extensions needed for mandatory
access control.
http://selinux.sf.net/resources.php3
 has some good pointers for SELinux
resources.  There is also a recently created SELinux news site at
http://selinuxnews.org/wp/.
