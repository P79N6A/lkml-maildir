Do you plan to change the PCI core to do these things any time soon?  
Wouldn't that require changing a whole bunch of PCI drivers too?  I
tend to agree that having the core take care of these choreographed
activities would be good -- it would leave less room for drivers to
make mistakes.
So for now maybe it would be best just to rearrange the existing calls
in USB, and wait for the core changes before doing anything more
ambitious.

For USB this doesn't matter; we don't free the IRQs during suspend.
