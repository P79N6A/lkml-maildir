Hi!
There was a patch some time ago included in linux-2.4.17-pre6 which fixed mmap 
semaphore deadlock in do_coredump (double down_read() on mmap_sem).
This fix introduces down_write() on mmap_sem and uses get_user_pages() 
function to avoid do_page_fault().
The question is why down_write() is used in elf_core_dump() (instead of 
down_read())?
