Filesystems don't usually wait on the IO to complete before submitting 
more IO in response to the next write() syscall.  They can do this by 
batching a whole bunch of operations into one committed transaction.
In reiser4 we do this more carefully than other filesystems such as 
reiserfs v3, and as a result every fs operation is fully atomic.
