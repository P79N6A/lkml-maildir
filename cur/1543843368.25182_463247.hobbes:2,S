The ltt_traces_sem mutex is intended to make this safe. However, the transport
separation patch, contributed recently, uses its own transport_list_lock, which
seems to be broken.
I will fix it by using ltt_traces_sem around :
        down(&ltt_traces_sem);
        list_for_each_entry(tran, &ltt_transport_list, node) {
                if (!strcmp(tran->name, trace_type)) {
                        transport = tran;
                        break;
                }
        }
        if (!transport) {
                err = EINVAL;
                printk(KERN_ERR "LTT : Transport %s is not present.\n", trace_type);
                goto trace_error;
        }
        if(!try_module_get(transport->owner)) {
                err = ENODEV;
                printk(KERN_ERR "LTT : Can't lock transport module.\n");
                goto trace_error;
        }
        up(&ltt_traces_sem);
And change the transport_list_lock for ltt_traces_sem everywhere else.
Thanks for spotting this bug,
Mathieu
