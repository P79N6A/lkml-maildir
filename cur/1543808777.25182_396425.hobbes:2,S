Really sad to say, but my Alsa ens1370 regression due to suspend problem
is still there.
Only fix is reboot actually. Ready to patch :)
PS.
i have a bug similar to:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6038
 (marked as blocking by
Andrew)
on my laptop.
but my dma expiry problem only happens during suspend.
I have a Sis 630 chipset with a 2.5" hitachi drive.
Been there...for ages..i can say: always...never got a working 2.6 kernel.
However in my poor opinion it's not blocking on my system, just boring.
