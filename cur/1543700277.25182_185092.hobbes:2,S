Hello Andrew, hello Linus,
because of the "stable freeze" 2.6.0 release a bunch of patches
for the DVB subsystem has piled up. 8-)
These 12 patches try to sync the DVB drivers hosted by
http://www.linuxtv.org
 with 2.6.0.
As usual, detailed descriptions are at the beginning of each patch.
Please note that patch "01-DVB-av7110-firmware-removal.diff" now
finally removes the firmware blob for the dvb-ttpci driver, so the
patch is quite large and has only been sent to you in a separate mail.
We're planning to remove the firmware files from other drivers as well.
The firmware removal depends on the latest patch by Manuel Estrada Sainz
<ranty@debian.org> which is currently only in the -mm
tree.
It fixes firmware_class to use a kernel_thread instead of scheduling
a work queue which will freeze the system if you don't use the firmware
hotplug systems. I hope it's ok if you apply this cross-subsystem patch
this time, I'll write a separate mail to Manuel, too.
Please apply.
Thanks!
Michael.
