This is normal.
We check for 0xffffffff because that is often how a fault is indicated, 
when the memory location is read during or immediately after hotplug (or 
if the PCI bus is truly faulty).  So for most hardware, you see
tmp = read(irq status)
if (!tmp)
	return irq-none		/* no irq events raised */
if (tmp == 0xffffffff)
	return irq-none		/* hot unplug or h/w fault */
and the method that determines no interrupt handling is needed.
