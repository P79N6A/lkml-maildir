Assembly is tedious. One C statement might result in much more
assembly (& machine language) than you started with. 
In the end, for normal applications you end up with about half the
amount of binary as what you wrote in code (in bytes). This is of
course, easily distorted by linking in lots of libraries (which you
shouldn't do). Or by having more comments than code. Or by counting
the symbols that are needed for linking. 
Linux kernel uncompressed:                    1.5M
stripped:                                     1.2M
random junk at the end of the file:  0.2M  -> 1.0M
"strings" (printk formats etc)       0.13M -> 0.87M
So, as a rough guess, only about 2.4Mbyte out of the 60Mb of source
code is involved in generating the 1.2Mb linux-kernel.
One project:

new> wc *.c | tail -1

Other project:
3dgr> wc *.c | tail -1
  25951   93410  752122 total
3dgr> wc *.o | tail -1
