Hi, I'd like to ask you a few questions:
* Do you like the way linux distributions integrate the kernel?
* Wouldn't you prefer they ship with the stable and still maintained 
2.6.16.X, while providing optionally the latest kernel for those who 
want or just have a new hardware?
* Do you think the megafreeze development model [1] and the "I don't 
trust in upstream" development model are broken? (And why)

(I'm going to ask this for several projects, not only the kernel)
