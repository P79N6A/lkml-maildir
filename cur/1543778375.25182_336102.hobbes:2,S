Subject: setting task->ioprio from a kernel thread

In OCFS2 there is currently an in-kernel heartbeat thread that really 
wants to communicate liveness to other nodes as quickly as possible by 
writing to a block device.  Setting aside the specific wisdom of a 
kernel heartbeat thread for a bit, has it been considered that kernel 
threads might want to set their io priority with the task->ioprio bits? 
  Neither set_task_ioprio() nor sys_ioprio_set() seem to be accessible 
to modules and open-coding it is clearly a bad idea.  Would the universe 
be opposed to a _GPL() export of, say, the sys_() interface?
