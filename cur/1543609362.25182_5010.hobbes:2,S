I've got the same setup and things work fine.  Do you have the "Special UDMA
feature" enabled in the Promise driver configuration portion of the kernel
config?  Perhaps it specifically needs that while any other EIDE driver (like
the embedded PIIX4) would already use DMA..
Perhaps Andre can give us a final answer :)
