The CPU usage is not significant for the lower numbers (<30%) and seems
linear to the delivered bandwidth for the faster configurations (up to
80% or so when approaching 250M/s write and 360M/s read).

I was only using 32k, but when I tried changing this to 4 megs I got no
improvement, leading me to guess that this wasn't it. Unfortunately I
changed it to "4M", something which mkraid happily accepted but
interpreted as "4k".
I didn't verify this against /proc/mdstat then, just noticed this now.

Yeah, the raid5s too if needed, but those take a while to resync before
benchmarking.

Yes, this is much better. I have a 64k raid5 chunksize. A chunksize of
4096k gives 265313kB/s write and 368228kB/s for a single stream, 512k
chunksize also gives decent performance (slightly better read and rewrite
performance, somewhat lower read performance).
I'll continue tweaking and testing some, please respond (and Cc: me) if
you want to know anything more or if I should try something special.
