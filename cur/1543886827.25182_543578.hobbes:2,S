Hi,
When open/close evdev, the code is as following to handle multi-client
operation:
static int evdev_release(...)
{
	...
	if (!--evdev->open) {
		<------------preempted
		if (evdev->exist)
			input_close_device(...);
		else
			evdev_free(evdev);
	}
	return 0;
}
static int evdev_open(...)
{
	...
	if (!evdev->open++ && evdev->exist)｛
		errror = input_open_device(...);
		if (error) {
			...
		}
	}
	...
	return 0;
}
So if the evdev_release() is preempted at the point marked by another
process which will open the evdev, which will make operation sequence
like:
   --evdev->open in evdev_release()
         -----> preempted
	                            evdev->open++ and input_open_devie()
	 <----- reschedule 
	input_close_device()
Should we introduce a mutex here? Or do I miss something? Thanks.
Regards
Yin, Fengwei
