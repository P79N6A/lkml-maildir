oops I was half asleep
Driver sets
	skb->mac.raw
	skb->pkt_type
	skb->protocol
(see net/ethernet/eth.c)
	skb->h.raw and skb->nh.raw are set by the receive action code
On transmit
	nh.raw is set by the protocol
Note that non -ac kernels have a bug where a packet consisting of pure mac
header causes bogus warnings
