Note that I was just reading code and not actually mkfs-ing any dos

Hmmm, it is not painfully slow on MO media using UnixWare7 dosfs. But I
haven't run any benchmarks to compare so it probably depends on what you
mean by "painfully slow".

No, I had not but now I have, thank you. Now that I have read it, I think
it is wrong, i.e. refers to the situation as it existed many years ago.

Hmmm, I thought that this was the case in the old days but nowadays, if
you use windows98 to format the disk it stores the "logcal sector size" in
the first 512-bytes sector containg all the header information.
Btw, UnixWare7 deals with this correctly (i.e. uses the correct sector
size and not the 512-bytes-all-the-time). I was just curious if this was
the case with Linux and suspected yesterday that it's not. You seem to
confirm that.
