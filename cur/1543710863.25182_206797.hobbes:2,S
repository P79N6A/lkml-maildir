Kernel.org bk2 was the first bk snapshot with prism54 driver in it.
bk4 is out already and some changes were already made too. 
I was going to make some cvs repository changes today @ prism54.org
in order to attempt to keep a synced up repository for development 
but I realize this is just not going to be possible. You can't stop 
what goes on in the kernel tree and keeping our repository in-sync 
with the latest bk snapshots is just too much pain in the ass to even 
consider we'd be able to work out of a prism54 tree and write valid 
patches.
At this point I think we can safely say the the prism54 project has 
been complete. Although forced upon, this is not necessarily 
a bad thing. The 2.6 prism54 driver is just going to take a life of 
its own now and its out of our hands what goes on with it.
The 2.4 driver is still in our tree and not sure if it'll go into 2.4.
We'll see. Anyway for now the prism54.org project can still be home to further
advances of the driver/support. Please feel free to CC patches to us 
(prism54-devel@prism54.org) for review in e-mails sent to netdev / Jeff / kernel 
mailing lists for peer review and updates. That's what we're now here for. 
If you have other large prism54 contributions you can use prism54.org as your home.
As for USB support maybe now we can put this as high priority while
other aspects of the driver are hammered by other developers. If you
will like to still follow up on the latest on prism54 development,
prism54.org will be the home for it. Just remember that it'd be just easier
for you to work out of kernel.org bk snapshots when writing patches
since we're no longer the home of the latest prism54 src.
