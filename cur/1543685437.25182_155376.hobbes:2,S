In the past, I proposed to have at least 2 schedulers available (much
like we have for I/O schedulers): one for servers, which doesn't mess
with bonuses and interactivity too much and gives best throughput for
batch processing (OLTP and in general, non-interactive loads), and
another one for desktops or Terminal Servers.
Don't know if this is feasible, however.
