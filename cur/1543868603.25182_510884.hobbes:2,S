On a 64 bit process with a 32 bit user app calling this ioctl, the kernel
would read the pointer value from the 8 bytes at the end, which means that
it will read four bytes after the end of the structure and interpret
whatever it finds as a pointer, instead of using only the first four
bytes as the lower half.
