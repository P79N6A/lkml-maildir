Interesting comment on /.:

From the LavaRND people. Apparently images produced with the binary 
pcwx portion loaded (full-sized frame) had *less* entropy than the 
smaller images produced without. Hence they speculate that the 
function of the binary pcwx part is actually to interpolate the 
160x120 image to the bigger 640x480 size, and has little to do with 
hardware..
allegedly..
