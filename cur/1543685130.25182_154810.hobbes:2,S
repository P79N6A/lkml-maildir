Just via some instrumenting, I can see that a real-time task never
begins throttling and this translates to a ~1ms reduction in worst case
allocation on a fast machine latency under extreme page dirtying and
writeback (basically, I cannot reproduce any variation in page
allocation, now, for a real-time test app). So it works.
But I do not have any real world test to confirm a benefit, which is
what matters. Have you poked and prodded?
