Speaking of which, I guess no one ever stepped up & fixed the patch for
x86_64?  AFAICT it should not be too hard to get PREEMPT_DESKTOP
working, as the previous VP patch sets worked, then the timer interrupt
threading changes broke it.  But you can't thread the timer irq with
PREEMPT_DESKTOP anyway.
Unfortunately I can only offer moral support as I don't have the
hardware...
