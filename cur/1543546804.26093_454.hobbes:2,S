I implemented it in the past and tried it for networking (tuning slab sizes
to MTUs, some remnants are still skbuff.c). I just used a stop the world 
scheme, so no locking was needed. It unfortunately performed badly because 
of the large page orders needed so I dropped it.

It is just not done, and I think it is not worth it.

Wouldn't that destroy one of the most important advantages of a zone allocator?

I'm worrying less about performance than about memory usage and fragmentation
(slab pages tied although they only have a few active objects left)

On 32MB machines it was a big problem in my experiments.
