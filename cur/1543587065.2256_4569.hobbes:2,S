        RFC 2487        STARTTLS
        RFC 2554        SMTP-Auth, + M$ Exchange / + Netscape
                        ( + a bunch of other authenticator methods )
        Under encryption, plaintext username + password login.
        The IETF protocols DO NOT support plaintext login for
        obvious security reasons.
        No hazzles about autenticating by certificates.
        Availability of the feature is probably excidingly rare..
