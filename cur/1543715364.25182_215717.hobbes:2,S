Since I don't know which category of ACPI bugtracking my "bug" fits into I 
send the symptom here:
cat /proc/interrupts
  0:   41075417    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:      27326    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  7:          0    IO-APIC-edge  parport0
  8:          4    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 12:     226123    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
 14:     152298    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:         92    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 16:      28174   IO-APIC-level  ide2, saa7134[0]
 17:      86370   IO-APIC-level  CMI8738
 19:    3500294   IO-APIC-level  nvidia
 20:    5858400   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd, eth0
 21: 2678002320   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd
 22:         79   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
NMI:      13435 
LOC:   40935121 
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
and the same only 5 seconds later:
  0:   41082729    IO-APIC-edge  timer
  1:      27350    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
  7:          0    IO-APIC-edge  parport0
  8:          4    IO-APIC-edge  rtc
  9:          0   IO-APIC-level  acpi
 12:     226123    IO-APIC-edge  i8042
 14:     152313    IO-APIC-edge  ide0
 15:         92    IO-APIC-edge  ide1
 16:      28243   IO-APIC-level  ide2, saa7134[0]
 17:      86515   IO-APIC-level  CMI8738
 19:    3500917   IO-APIC-level  nvidia
 20:    5859792   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd, eth0
 21: 2679242125   IO-APIC-level  ehci_hcd
 22:         79   IO-APIC-level  ohci_hcd
NMI:      13438 
LOC:   40942396 
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
It seems as if irq21 (ehci_hcd) got hit 1 239 805 times in only 5 seconds 
without me even using USB in that period.
Please tell me into which category I should file this issue and I will happily 
file a bug report right after...
thanks, christian.
