Hi Andrew,
a couple of s390 patches for the current git tree. Bug fixes and
some cleanup, nothing to worry about (but I bet Christoph will
find something to nit-pick anyway ;-).
I won't be able to sent patches for couple of weeks, as usual
Heiko Carstens will take over until I'm back.
blue skies,
  Martin.
