Andrew,
Now the patches are simplified and rebased to 2.6.23-rc2-mm2.
The following two patches should be put immediately after
writeback-fix-periodic-superblock-dirty-inode-flushing.patch:
 writeback: fix time ordering of the per superblock inode lists 8   
 writeback: fix ntfs with sb_has_dirty_inodes()                     
Thank you,
Fengguang
