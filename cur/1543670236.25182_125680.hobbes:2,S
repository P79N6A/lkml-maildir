Known problem, a patch that gets rid of this symtom has been posted
here, and to linux-usb-devel in the past.  It's also in the -mm tree.
I have a number of USB patches queued up to send to Linus to fix this
problem for real, but am waiting for the kernel.org machines to come up
again to send them off.
Thanks,
