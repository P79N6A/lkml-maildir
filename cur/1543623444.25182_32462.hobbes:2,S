What about memory for streaming mappings. I know pci_map_single (and _sg) will
use bounce buffers on platforms without an IOMMU, but wouldn't it be nice if
this could also be ensured by the device driver to avoid uneccessary copying.
It could for example be solved with a GFP_32BIT flag or something (on IA64 I
know GFP_DMA is used in pci_alloc_consistent() to get memory below 4GB but that
can't be used on all platforms).
