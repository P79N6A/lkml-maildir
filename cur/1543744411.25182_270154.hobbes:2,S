Yes, I agree now, but after investigating further here is what I have found.
If you think this is good, please ack this patch.

Here is what exactly happening. Please see the patch.
In ACPI, kobject_init() is called without initializing kobj.kset.
Due to this kset.kobj's refcount does not get incremented.
Again when we try to do kobject_unregister(), kset of the kobject
that is getting unregister is obtained and kset's kobject refcount
is decremented which was at teh first place never got inceremened.
Due to this kset's kobj's refcount is decremented with out getting
incremented and due to this bug, this kset.kobj is getting released.
Below fix fixes this problem. If you find this this Good patch,
please ack this patch. I am copying to Len too on this patch.
