Right.

Because I thought about doing something like:
	/* Avoid touching pages from zones which
         * are not from the zone being scanned
	 */
	if (page->zone != zone)
		return;
But then I figured out that its stupid.
I ended up using the "zone_t *zone" as a boolean and forgot to change it
before sending the patch.

Because I tried to avoid strict perzone shortage handling, keeping the
global scanning to have _some_ "fair" aging between the zones.
The active/inactive dirty lists are shared by all zones, and page position
there is a method of page age indication.
So in most cases we are "fair" wrt list position and do global scanning.
Now if there is a real need, we do perzone scanning.
