I didn't realize that /mnt was a symlink to / (something I had tested a
while back and forgot to delete it)
This is on 2.2.13 SMP.  I mounted a machine via nfs to /mnt and /proc/mounts
shows that it's mounted to /mnt, but unfortunately, it messed up seeing /
Somethings are still there, others aren't.
Any ideas on how to fix it w/o a reboot?  I can't unmount it unfortunately.
