The field name is a good suggestion.
What I have there is not actually a full-blown file io descriptor, because
there is no file or offset. It is just an iovec iterator (so maybe I should
rename it to iov_iter, rather than iodesc). 
I think it might be a nice idea to keep this iov_iter as a standalone
structure, and it could be embedded into a struct file_io?
Thanks,
Nick
