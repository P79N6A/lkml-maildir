Andrew, can you apply the patch below for 2.6.22?  It reverts
smsc-ircc2 to the old blind probing behavior.  There's a lot of
infrastructure work I need to do before the PNP probe will be
reliable.
Thanks,
  Bjorn

[patch] smsc-ircc2: bypass PNP detection until we get the quirks worked out
Don't use PNP detection by default yet.  We have some PNP and BIOS issues
to work out first.
Sample problem on a Toshiba Portege 4000: the SMCf010 device is handed off
disabled.  We assign I/O ports originally assigned to the SMCf010 to a
PCMCIA device instead.  We enable the SMCf010, configuring it to use
disjoint ports, but _SRS doesn't work correctly, so the device doesn't
work.
