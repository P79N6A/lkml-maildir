Our HP DAT (24 GB) occasionally locks up. This doesn't lead to system
lockup, but it's probably because there are no HDDs connected to SCSI bus.
Resetting the DAT (by cycling power) doesn't help, the SCSI
controller/driver gets somehow confused. It requires hardware reset.
This happened also with OpenBSD, although power cycling the DAT fixed the
situation there. I believe it's either buggy software in DAT drive or the
drive is breaking up (those thingies seem to last for about two years). (Or
there is some other SCSI hardware related issue.)
I have tested this with 2940/2930 cards. I think it could lead to system
lockup if there were SCSI HDD with swap connected to same controller.
