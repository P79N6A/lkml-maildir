Hi,
after applying Dipankar Sarma's patch for the fcntl64 Oops, 2.6.12-mm1 works 
nicely here (x86). One oddity: If I don't "loadkeys anything", only the very 
basic keys work, all F* keys etc. are dead.
Is this an intentional change to force people to do the right thing and load 
some keymap, or a bug?
