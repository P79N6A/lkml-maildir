This patch is not intended for 2.6.24, so that won't help. :-)
I saw Mattias's reply, but I didn't see him suggest any other
fixes... :-(  I'm wondering if maybe you tried reverting it anyway?
I only ask because the call trace references symbols that would seem
to relate to the patch.  So even if _why_ it might break things isn't
obvious, it still might be worth trying a revert "just in case". :-)

I've seen other reports of rt61 working fine with 2.6.24.  So I
suppose you should open a bug.
Thanks!
