Using e2fsprogs libraries should be at least as performant as reading
the blocks myself. I think that if we can improve the speed of reading
filesystem/inode information, we should do this in e2fsprogs, so all
tools could benefit of it...

e2fsprogs gives all the inode information available, so I don't see your
point here...
