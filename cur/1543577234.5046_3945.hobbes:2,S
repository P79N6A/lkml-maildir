Yes, we would be explictly saying it is an error to always return 1.
The problem with [mf]sync is that we really want to write the page before
returning back to the application.  So, skipping dirty pages that need to
hit the disk is just as big an error.  Since the FS can't know the context
of when writepage is called, it would be obligated to never return 1 when
the page has data that needs to hit disk. 
Is there an easier/better way to tell writepage callers to retry the page
write later?
