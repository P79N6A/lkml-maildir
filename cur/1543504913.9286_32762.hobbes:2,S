Yes, you are.

	It isn't done and any locking works only if everybody use it.
Probably using rwlock-style semantics (modulo sleeping, indeed - you don't
want spinlocks here) would be the right thing. Then we have write() as
reader, knfsd write() as writer and quite probably truncate() as writer
too.
