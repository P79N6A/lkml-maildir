Hi,
We are porting an upper layer device driver of SCSI (sd ) from Solaris to
Linux.
We want to develop an upper layer (for a block device) which can interact
with the middle generic layer(scsi_mod).What are the list of API's exposed
by the middle layer and where can I get a documentation of these i.e how
does the upper layer interact with the middle layer?
Also what methods do the upper layer needs to expose to the user
application?
Thanks nad Regards
Chandrasekhar
