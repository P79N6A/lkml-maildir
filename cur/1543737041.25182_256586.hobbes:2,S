Apologies, I wasn't trying to shut down the conversation with a magic
O(N) wand.

O(N/128) = O(N), but you knew that already. My fully arbitrary units,
however, were in terms of what needs to be done from userspace to
recreate the information that the kernel already had, and that means
basically scanning a directory of N items. Sure, it's less than N
syscalls, but userspace is still going to ask the CPU to do N
comparisons across N items, with all the implications that comes along
with that. (To be explicit: Syscalls, memory usage for caching, blowing
the processor cache by visiting lots of useless items, and speed of just
CPU time for the comparisons.)

Yeah, well, dnotify asks userspace to do much the same thing. This is
marginally better, in that we'd know what we're looking for once we see
it. However, dnotify has shown that forcing userspace to cache the
entire contents of all the directories it wishes to watch doesn't scale
well. That's one of the core problems they're trying to address, and
passing an inode number back would reintroduce it.

Yes.

It shouldn't be persuasive on its own. It should be coupled with the
fact that dnotify already forces an O(N) workload per directory onto
userspace, and that has shown itself to not work well.

Y'know, I keep hearing this, but I'm afraid I'm just too dense to get
it. How about we get it right once, in the kernel and userspace, and we
make a library out of it so that luser space authors like myself don't
have to reinvent the wheel? (getdents(2) seems to work somehow.) I'll
even offer to write the code once I can sit down and spend time with the
kernel again, if no one else is willing to touch this.

Sure, there are designs that have a natural fit with the system, and
others that don't. Much like trying to express a trig function in terms
of polynomials. Not a good fit, and you get a massive series to try to
approximate it, if you'll forgive a calculus analogy. Anyway, the kernel
*has* that information already, so we're not shoving the work somewhere
else just to make userspace simpler somehow (which is always a specious
argument).
I think I understand your point. What I'd suggest is reading Robert's
"Why inotify?" that's posted along with the inotify patches (see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/28/201
 for example) to get a small feel for
what issues are trying to be addressed.
Off to do honest work,
Ray
