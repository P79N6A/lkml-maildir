aaargggggghhh.  I noticed that when I was reviewing the patch, but promptly
forgot to check it more closely.
However, in reviewing it, I don't see exactly what's going on.  Because only
one process is accessing the stat information of the fsx inode anyway?
Yes, we need to rub out that i_bytes/i_blocks thing, replace it with an
atomically updated loff_t, etc.  But I'd like to understand what the exact
failure is first.  It _seems_ that stat has somehow seen a >4G value of
stat->size, but how can this happen???
I need to breathe life back into my P4 box, see if I can get it to happen
there.
Thanks.
