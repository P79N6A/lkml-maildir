hi ,
In wireless network ,most of the attacks occurs at mac
layer .so i think ,we should detect this attack at mac
layer itself.so I think we can add lsm hooks at mac
layer
in linux for wireless networks.so i want to add new
hooks in it  . therefore i want to know the procedure
of adding new hooks,which file should i change,which
functions should i write and like that .Hooks may be
of any type for time being .
                help me out.
                                        bye
