Don't do it in procfs. Make a separate filesystem and mount it on the
empty directory in /proc, if you really need it (I'ld rather use some
other location - even /dev/shm would be better). This filesystem will have
_nothing_ with proc in terms of code. There is enough mess in procfs
already. Keep this one separate.
