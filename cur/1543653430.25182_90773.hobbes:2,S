I disagree with you.  It introduces more enhancements,
and more bugfix than the current code.  I admit that tt
could introduce some news bugs, but in the balance it
should be more stable than before.
Really, I will be happy to see new code in mainstream.

What is actually the trouble with your Vaio (I mean dmesg when
it failed) ?  I saw some (old) Vaio where new code worked
like a charm (even speedstep worked, but it's another
story ;)
I would be happy also to take a look to the DSDT table of your model.
Cheers,
