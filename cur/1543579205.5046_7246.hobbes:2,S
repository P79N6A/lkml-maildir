I can get any info needed, you just have to define the scope.
Then will not can and will not give out details on a generic form.
In short no one person can see the entire design docs or will they get
them without a NDA.  I have seen why this is the case, cause the toy are
cool.

You don't get it, they OEM board designs for Compaq and Dell.
These guys will work with you on-site but in their sand-box not yours.
I wish I could say more, but I have something more powerfully than any NDA
ever written.  I have given my word and a handshake, and that has more
value to me than any stupid NDA.  The very fact that I value this so much
and so many in the industry know this about me, I have been shown things
without NDA's that you never see otherwise.
They are very friendly to Linux, but can we be friendly to them?
You just can not barge in and demand to see their IP.
