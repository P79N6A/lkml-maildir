Hi!
I just got the 2.4.0-test8 (test9 did the same), set it up, compiled it (same
procedure as I always do when I'm installing a new kernel):
make menuconfig
make dep clean zlilo modules modules_install
Okay, 2.4.0-testX said it was too big, so I tried bzImage instead of zlilo and
did a
cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /vmlinuz && lilo
(PS: I even tried with make install instead of make bzImage, cp, lilo)
but everything I got was "Uncompressing the kernel... Ok, now booting Linux"
(don't know if it's the exact message, but it's the second line while booting,
so I think, you know what I mean) and after this line, the system is laying
around and doing nothing.
My configuration:
Siemens Primergy 4-way (4x PPro 200), Kernel optimized for 6x86 which did with 2.3.9
256 MB of SDRAM, Adaptec 2940U(W?) (included aic7xxx-driver static),
Mylex DAC960PD (compiled as module, because the aic has the boot disk), but
will be disabled till I get a firmware-upgrade.
Intel EtherExpress (included eepro100 static)
When I compiled the 2.3.9, everything worked okay (but it has no Mylex support).

I'm not compiling with -j because I got some problems with it in the past.
If you need any additional information, feel free to write me.
I couldn't find IP aliasing support in this version. Is it now always-on?
Thank you & bye,
Sebastian
