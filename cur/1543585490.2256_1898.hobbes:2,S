This is actually a sticky area.  For example, I remember that a long
time ago I noticed that it wasn't necessarily guarenteed that even
all the flush_tlb_{page,mm,range}() stuff was done under the page
table lock.
Maybe things have changed since then, but...
Furthermore I did not specify that flush_page_to_ram/flush_icache_page
can assume this, see Documentation/cachetlb.txt
I have no problem adding this invariant to some of the interfaces, but
we have to audit things.

The r2300 port is UP-only btw...
