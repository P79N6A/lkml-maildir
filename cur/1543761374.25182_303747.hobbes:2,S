FreeBSD seems to fail in the same way on the same hardware,
unfortunately. I'm leaning towards suspecting that we need to be doing
something with the contents of the _GTF method, but by the looks of that
that requires us to be able to work out which methods correspond to
which hardware. Is anyone working on implementing this?
