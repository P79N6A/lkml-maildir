Absolutely correct.  For this and other reasons, doing a lot of work
between vfork() and execve() (et al) is generally a BAD IDEA.
It would be better to write something like:
	char *exeFile= GetExecutableName();
	if (!vfork()) {
	  execl(exeFile, ...);
	}
As soon as any of the execve(2) family succeeds, the child is no longer
sharing memory with the parent and altering pages is no longer an issue.

True, but this isn't always desirable.

Right.  For several UNIXen, vfork() == overcommit, fork() == no-overcommit.
Each behavior is useful in the right situation.  Both situations may arise
in the same executable, e.g., a forking server that prints using relatively
small external filters like ghostscript.  Having both overcommit and
no-overcommit behaviors available simultaneously is very useful -- as
opposed to a global switch applied to everything.
I'm not about to argue that vfork()/fork() is the best way to accomplish
this.  I'm only pointing out that this is *one* way, that it already
happens to work on several UNIXen, and that it is a natural consequence of
BSD's classic vfork() behavior (no page copies ever) combined with a
copy-on-write fork().
