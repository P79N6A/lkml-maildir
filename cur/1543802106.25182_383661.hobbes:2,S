This warning better reads in such a way:
FAT: this is not the recommended filesystem for use with UTF-8 filenames.
Reason: the utf8 IO charset is the only IO charset that displays 
filenames properly in UTF-8 locales. So the choice is really between 
case-sensitive filenames (iocharset=utf8) and completely unreadable 
filenames (everything else).
