Ah. By
"type a number on the keypad" 
you mean    type a 2-nybble hex number in 2 keystrokes?

Not exactly the same, in that a Compose key doesn't have to be held
down, but all bytes are available, and I'll definitely have a look.

Which is generally excellent, BTW. I'll have another look. I still think a
little bit more overview is called for in man keymaps, as well as a
copyright, btw. I must admit I haven't looked at the FAQ recently, but 
I've had this erroneous idea that one can't do arbitrary bytes in
the console for quite a while, so I still think this should be made more 
prominent in the docs.

Thanks aed, thanks A. Curry.
U. Drepper, I know it's not how Compose keys ARE used. With enough of
them, and 255 isn't enough, my method doesn't break anything.
