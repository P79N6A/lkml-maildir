i'm not sure what point you are trying to make, but 'low RT load' in
this context means up to a load of 1.0. (i.e. one or less tasks running
on average)
also, this only applies to SMP systems.
thirdly, even if the new balancing code kicks in, the overhead is not
that bad, and it's for a purpose: we rather want an RT task to run on a
free CPU.
