I don't know -- I have not reread everything. Please don't consider
my comments as approval of the code base. I still think it does quite
a lot of dubious and ugly things overall and should get far more clean up
and get more testing too.

Stopping all CPUs for indefinite time very much seems like 
"breaking a correctly working system" to me.  In a correctly working system 
kgdb is never entered.

The only way I know of to do that is gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore 
kgdb certainly isn't it.

For that gdb vmlinux /proc/kcore already works fine. Or fireproxy.
If that was the only goal we wouldn't need all that stub code.

The main complexity in module handling is handling (or rather preventing)
module unload.  I explicitely excluded that in my earlier mail. 
Module loading on the other hand tends to be relatively easy.
I did a modular kernel debugger on my own some time ago and once
the interfaces were clean it was very simple. I think the reverse
is true too -- if having it as a module is easy then the interfaces
are clean too. That is why I asked for it. It's a good basic
sanity check on the design.

If that is true then it is definitely misnamed and likely 
incorrectly implemented on the architecture in question.

Yeah, it is consistently wrong agreed.
