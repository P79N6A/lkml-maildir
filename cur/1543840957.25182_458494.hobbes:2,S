UHmm.... yes.  In that case we can remove lots of stuff from
invalidate_inode_pages2_range as we can be sure the page won't be
dirty or in writeback so invalidate_complete_page will be certain to
succeed. 
So if that goes ahead, these become moot.  But until it does, these
would be nice to have :-)
Also, the patch at
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm&m=115443228617576&w=2
appears not to set 
  +	.vm_flags	= VM_CAN_INVLD,
for nfs_fs_vm_operations, but maybe they are a later addition to
nfs...
Thinks: should I subscribe to linux-mm... only about 100 messages per
week.... maybe :-)
Thanks,
NeilBrown
