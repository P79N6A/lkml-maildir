The boundary in question is exec(). We don't allow ptrace attach during
an exec in process and that may well make the specific mm untraceable.
So the lifetime is something like
	exec
		no attach
		create mm
		load stuff
		destroy old mm
		if suid
			no ptrace
		can attach (maybe)
So an open by self before an exec always refers to the old dead mm and
the one after always hits the other checks. A user can ptrace their own
app but ptrace itself doesn't set ptraced exec's setuid.
