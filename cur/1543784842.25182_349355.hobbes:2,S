Agreed.

The drive was a Western Digital Protege WD400 40G PATA drive, no idea
whether that is to be considered 'cheap' but it wasn't exactly cheap
when I bought it.
I've had drives from lots of drive manufacturers (IBM, Hitachi, Samsung,
Maxtor, Western Digital, Spinpoint (?), Seagate) fail on me so far.  I
don't mind always buying known-good brand X, but how will I be sure that
one of brand X's drives won't eventually fail in a similar manner?
If you say that "The RAID1 driver design doesn't tolerate these kinds
of failures.", that sounds fair enough, but it would still be nice to
have an option to enable some extra consistency checking that would
catch this.

I personally wouldn't care if I have put three disks in every box I
build and if reads and writes are 500% slower if I would then be sure
that this silent failure would not occur.  I value data integrity
above performance even if that means slowing stuff down substantially.

That sounds like a nice thing to have in any case.
