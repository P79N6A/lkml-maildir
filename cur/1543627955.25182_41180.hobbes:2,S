Hi!
I'm still fighting the problem that power off doesn't work with one of our 
machines since moving from 2.2.19 to 2.4.7 kernel.
I compared both apm.c versions (1.13ac and 1.14) but there are no 'real'
changes to the functions involved in the shutdown process, except some
minor changes to macro definitions.
'cat /proc/apm' says '1.14 1.2 0x03 0x01 0xff 0x80 -1% -1 ?' which are all 
normal values for non-notebooks.
I'm a little bit stuck with this and I have no idea what to look for so hints 
would be highly appreciated!

P.S. Yes, apm is supported by the bios, I have enabled apm, I tried real mode 
power off, I tried using apm as module and also tried acpi instead
