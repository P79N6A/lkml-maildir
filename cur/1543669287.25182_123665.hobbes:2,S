Greetings.
From what I able to find from some searching around, the implementation
by MCLX ("
http://oss.missioncriticallinux.com/projects/mcore/"
) is being
carried on at 
http://lists.insecure.org/lists/linux-kernel/2003/Feb/0987.html.
Looking at these patches, I can only see x86 architecture support for
in memory kernel crash dump support. Is anyone actively working on the
PowerPC architecture?
Best regards,
-Arun.
