non-keepalive connections are bad, but after that the congestion window

The only object of my posts was to try to correct the misinformation
that was spreading from Larry's posts that implied you had to buy a
speparate connection to shape the bitkeeper connections doing clones of
the tree. That's what I and everybody else understood. Now apparently he
was wrong and the hurting factor aren't the bitkeeper clients cloning
the tree but the webserver. So I'm glad to have reached my object.
