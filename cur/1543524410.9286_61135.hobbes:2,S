In The Beginning (late 1991), Linux developers were chronically broke college 
students running whatever obsolete hardware we managed to scrounge up.
In the SCSI-1 spec that some of this conformed to, Read-6 was required.
Read-10 was suggested as a good idea.  Since some devices Wedged until
power cycled when fed a command they didn't support, I figured that 
using Read-6 until we absolutely positively had to use Read-10 was a 
fine idea.
In the 00's, it's probably a better idea to always use Read-10 unless 
we're talking to a SCSI-1 device with READ CAPACITY returning a size 
that can be accessed with Read-6 commands.
