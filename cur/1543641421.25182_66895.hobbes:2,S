FTF = Fan The Flames :)
Hi all, 
	Since there are some folks who felt this could still be useful as a
boot option, here is the "badtsc" half of my earlier tsc-disable patch.
Briefly, the patch keeps the kernel from using possibly unsynced TSCs
for gettimeofday calculations, while sill allowing userspace to read the
TSCs without warning. 
Personally, I've been swayed by Andrea that this isn't the proper
solution to keep user-space apps that blindly use the rdtsc instruction
from crashing when the TSCs are disabled. Instead I feel forcing apps
(and i686 compiled glibc, <nudge, nudge, Ulrich> ;) to check the CR4 for
availability is the proper solution. 
However, if one wants to still use the TSCs from userspace, for
statistical purposes only, with the understanding that values read may
not be sane, this patch will let them do so by passing "badtsc" as a
boot option. 
As long as folks still seem interested in this, I'll keep on maintaining
it, but if you feel it should just die, let me know.
thanks
