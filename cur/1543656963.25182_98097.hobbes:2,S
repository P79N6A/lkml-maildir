er, no. GigE over copper autodetects crossovers, so a standard cable
will work anyway. Actually this has been backported to some 100MB
switches now (presumably use same io interfaces) so crossover cables are
fast disappearing. You can even stick a non crossover cable between a
100MB pci card and a GigE one and it will work.
