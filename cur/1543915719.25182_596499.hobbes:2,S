RTC-related ... but it's a procfs bug, since it's procfs which doesn't
even bother to check for duplicate names before it registers files.
And it's that duplication which is the problem.  Try the patch in

I said it's not an RTC problem ... it's a procfs problem.

That _shouldn't_ be a problem at all; only one of them should be
able to bind to that hardware.
The only problem I see in these messages is that procfs bug.
