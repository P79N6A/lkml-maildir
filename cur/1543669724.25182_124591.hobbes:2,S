Nope - I didn't even know it existed - this was just, hmmm, it could
be done like this, plank! There.. It's small and to me it cuts it
well enough.
The char device node is a quick place where to hook the struct 
file_operations. I'd say this would go inside sysfs or something. 
It is not really important.

The intention is [unless I have screwed it up big time] that if there 
are no readers, the events are queued up. Once there is at least one
reader, then they are released as soon as they are read by all the
current readers. This way there is little chance for having a big accu-
mulation of unread events - once you start whatever event managing
daemon, you are set.
The idea of allowing multiple readers was so you can have other actors
listening for stuff - although the main one would always be the event
daemon (that could even forward the events).

Good try - I won't let go :) If you see this as something potentially
useful, how would you like it to develop so that in the long term 
it can be used? be it in parallel with /sbin/hotplug or as a 
potential replacement?
I guess that the first thing I would have to do is somehow look into
how hotplug is behaving now and hook it to do something similar, right?
See ya
