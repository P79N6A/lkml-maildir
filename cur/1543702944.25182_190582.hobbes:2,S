I'm surprised that you've seen this on 2.4, as the TSC time code does
not try to compensate for lost ticks. Instead we only use the TSC value
to offset from xtime, reseting our offset each tick. So changes in cpu
frequency should only cause time inconsistencies, not time doubling.
Might something be going oddly in setting up the timer interrupt on
restore? I'd be interested in more details. 
In 2.6 we do try to detect when cpufreq changes without notifying us.
However its a balancing act as the symptoms are the same as when you
have a broken PIT or lose too many interrupt. Hopefully HPET and the
ACPI PM timesource will provide more reliable time sources. 
thanks
