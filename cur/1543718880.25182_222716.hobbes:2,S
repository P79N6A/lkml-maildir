I am running out of (reasonable) ideas with this problem. The only thing I
can do now is to ask help from the Highest Summit:-)
Setup: an ARM PXA255 board with an IT8152 PCI companion chip and a PCI4520
cardbus controller. Kernel 2.4.21 (sorry...) A couple of devices on PCI-0:
IT8152-internal USB OHCI, a RTL8139 chip, a graphics controller, and the
cardbus.
Problem:
test 1. Run some load on USB, RTL, insert a 16-bit PCMCIA card in a
cardbus slot and put some load on it - everything works.
test 2. Do not load USB, RTL, insert a 32-bit CardBus card, e.g. a Xircom
eth, connect to 100MBps, put load - works.
test 3. Load USB, but do not put load, insert 32-bit Xircom, put load on
it. Works in the beginning, but then starts losing packets, slowly becomes
unusable. The higher the load - the faster it degrades.
test 4. Load USB, insert a CardBus USB2.0 (EHCI + OHCI) card, insert a
USB BT module in the card, configure it (hciconfig hci0 up), scan (hcitool
scan), so far everything works, but first by a l2ping attempt get a BUG()
in dma_to_ed_td(). Same in internal USB (OHCI too) works. Similarly, other
USB devices work "partly".
So, either PCI-0 alone (possibly with 16-bit PCMCIA in the cardbus), or
PCI-1 alone work. Simultaneously - not.
So, the question - what can it be? PCI misconfiguration? Timing?
Electrical problems on the bus?...
Thanks
