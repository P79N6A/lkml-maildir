I agree the old semantic is not nice. But it had none underlying problem
and there was software depending on it. After all /proc is special anyway
and I believe there's no standard enforcing rules on it ;).
My only point that the `not nice' argument is not strong enough to break
it in 2.2.x.

Ehh, not so easy. Try. (yes, very silly) OTOH I just wrapped open(2) via
LD_PRELOAD.
My worry is that there can be other custom software depending on the old
behaviour and backing out the change costs nothing.
