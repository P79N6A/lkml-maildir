As stated in my earlier replies to this issue:
Certain vendor RPMs for iptables have (unvoluntarily?) compiled in iptables
debugging .  At least RedHat and Mandrake seem to be falling in this category.
The debugging code does not work with recent kernels, but nobody was
assuming debugging would be enabled in production systems.
There are two solutions to the problem:
a) update to an iptables package which doesn't have debugging enabled
   (which is default with iptables source as distributed by the netfilter
    coreteam)
or 
b) use iptables from current CVS when you really need to have debugging
   enabled.  I will release iptables-1.2.6 soon, which will also have
   the debugging code fixed.
