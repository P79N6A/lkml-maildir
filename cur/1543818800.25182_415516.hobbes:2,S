Yes, it's hard to get out of such a situation if you get into one so 
that's why changes to try_to_wake_up() may be needed.  We certainly have 
to stop the load balancing code from creating these situations as well.

Yes, I've said similar in another thread but I agreed with Ingo when he 
said that this wasn't really a problem for the load balancer to solve. 
I expressed the same opinion as above, namely that this problem needs to 
be addressed in try_to_wake_up() (which isn't really load balancing) and 
suggested that (for high priority tasks) try_to_wake_up() should be 
modified to find either an idle CPU or (if it can't find an idle one) 
the CPU with the lowest priority current task.
However, it should be noted that Ingo is working on something for 
ensuring the distribution of RT tasks across CPUs and this is likely to 
overlap with this idea so consultation is necessary.
