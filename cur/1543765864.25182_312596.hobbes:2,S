Since the paper was written by theorists, it appears that they didn't
bother to read the implementation, but instead made assumptions from
the man pages, as well as making the assumption that the man page
(which was not written as a specification from which the code was
implemented, and indeed was not even written by the code authors) was
in fact an accurate representation of drivers/char/random.c.
So section 5.3 is essense a criticism of a straw man implementation
based on a flawed reading of a flawed man page.  Other than that, it's
fine.  :-)

For one, /dev/urandom and /dev/random don't use the same pool
(anymore).  They used to, a long time ago, but certainly as of the
writing of the paper this was no longer true.  This invalidates the
entire last paragraph of Section 5.3.
The criticisms of the /dev/random man page do have some point, but the
man page != the implementation.  Also, the paper does not so much make
an attack on the entropy estimator, so much as it casts asperions on
it, while at the same time making the unspoken assumption that
cryptographic primitives are iron-clad and unbreakable.
So I don't see any particular substantial deep questions, unless you
count, "It is not at all clear that /dev/random ... provides
information-theoretic security.  Indeed, we suspect it sometimes
doesn't" as a deep question.  I don't.
