2 questions:
1) Does that only affect memory barriers, or both memory barriers and
spinlocks?
example (from drivers/net/natsemi.c)
cpu0:
	spin_lock(&lock);
	writew(1, ioaddr+PGSEL);
	...
	writew(0, ioaddr+PGSEL);
	spin_unlock(&lock);
cpu1:
	spin_lock(&lock);
	readw(ioaddr+whatever);	// assumes that the register window is 0.
writew(1, ioaddr+PGSEL) selects a register window of the NIC. Are writew
and the spinlock synchonized on ppc64?
2) when you write "system memory", is that memory allocated with
kmalloc/gfp, or also memory allocated with pci_alloc_consistent()?
I've always assumed that
	pci_alloc_consistent_ptr->data=0;
	writew(0, ioaddr+TRIGGER);
is ordered, i.e. the memory write happens before the writew. Is that
guaranteed?
