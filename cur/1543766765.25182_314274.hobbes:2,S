The default ext3 journal size is inappropriately small, btw.  Normally you
should manually make it 128M or so, rather than 32M.  Unless you have a
small amount of memory and/or a large number of filesystems, in which case
there might be problems with pinned memory.
Mounting as ext2 is a useful technique for determining whether the fs is
getting in the way.
