and what part of the above do you consider to be a bug? So you have a
misconfigured system with no limits setup for a user (nobody _should_ need
them, users must be educated and not run the above stupid programs) and
expect the system to somewhow "guess" the kind of behaviour you expect?
How can it possibly guess? To me, the above is quite expected behaviour
for a desktop configuration.
