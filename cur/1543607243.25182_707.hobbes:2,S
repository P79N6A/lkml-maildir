Hi 
I'm having a very strange problem with lilo.
I run lilo it looks like it is writing the partition
table but it's not.
Problem begun in 2.4.10 and continued in 2.4.12
I double checked: lilo.config is good running lilo -V
shows that he is reading the config and writes the
partition table as instructed in lilo.conf but after
reboot nothing happens (i.e the new kernel )
I tried different lilo versions (21.7.5 , 22.0.2) and
the behaviour is unchanged
If I boot kernel 2.4.5 surprise lilo is actually
writing the partition table.
Any idea ?
Bye
