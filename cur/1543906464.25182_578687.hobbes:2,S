My concern is that only "get my line of code merged" is seen as "the
ultimate thing". It's more than that. Linux is about collaboration,
where it matters more that people work together to solve a problem, far
far more than who actually types the lines in on the keyboard. Working
on the problem should be seen (and recognized) as the right thing. Who
writes the code is secundary to that.
