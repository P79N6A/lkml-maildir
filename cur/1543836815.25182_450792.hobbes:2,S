Hi list,
I was curious as to why a Universal driver (using UNDI API) for Linux
does not exist (or does it)?
I want to try and write a such a driver that could (in principle)
handle all the NICs that are PXE compatible.
Has this been tried? What are the technical problems that might come in my way?
Thanks,
Dan
