Also note that the UTF-32 Unicode encoding would offer this property, 
but with the following disadvantages compared to the UTF-8 Unicode 
encoding:
- 7bit ASCII is not a subset of UTF-32 losing a lot of compatibility
  (code 7bit ASCII with some UTF-8 in the comments is no problem
   for not-Unicode aware systems except for slight misdisplayments 
   of the comments)
- UTF-32 has up to 4 times the size of UTF-8
There's also the point that you can use e.g. "wc" or your editor for 
counting the characters.
