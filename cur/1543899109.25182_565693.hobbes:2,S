And the 10% where it doesn't work it is a real pain to figure what goes
wrong due to the completely unreadable Makefiles generated by autotools.
 After all they are not Makefiles, they are shellscripts embedded into
Makefiles.

Well, it's not *that* hard to write makefiles which follow the usual
gnuish conventions, so stuff like "make DESTDIR=/tmp/buildroot install"
works just fine.  That isn't a reason to use autotools.  Especially as
people get that wrong *even with* autotools from time to time ...
