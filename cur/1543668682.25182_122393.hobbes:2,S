Well it's not a yahoo users problem because yahoo users can't fix
it. Some yahoo users have yahoo "free" mail as their only connection
to the internet because of facist network administrators. It gets
worse how that you can't tell a company to go screw themselves and
get another job. The three engineers that I know who use yahoo do
so because they don't have any choice and there is no way that they
can configure the mailer to get rid of the empty HTML section.
