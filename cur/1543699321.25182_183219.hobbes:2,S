We currently have a situation where an external company supplies us with 
a device driver containing a binary blob that was explicitly written as 
OS-agnostic, and a shim that is gpl'd (at least the linux shim is) to 
get the appropriate os-specific services.  I guess this would fall under 
the "not made just for linux" category in which you've placed the Nvidia 
driver?
Carrying on your analogy, this could be a generic love scene, with 
blanks in which to insert the character's names and location.
