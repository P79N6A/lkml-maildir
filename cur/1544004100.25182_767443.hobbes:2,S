To answer Zhang Rui's question, what I get is an approximation of what
Justin's posted here.

What I get when I use this is that the notebook goes to suspend state and
the only button that it has (power button) has a blue light that starts
blinking.
When I press the power button, as per your instructions, the machine powers
itself off and then, suddenly, it powers itself on again! (yes, that's
strange).
I'm filming this so that you can see for yourselves. The movie is at

Thanks for all your help, Rogério Brito.
