I get to choose the vga mode but nothing visible happens after that.
This seems like regression since even 2.6.23-rc2 from Debian
experimental (2.6.23~rc2-1~experimental.1~snapshot.9254) hangs the same
way. I've tried -git's upto 2.6.22-git5 which fails too.
Which patch included this new setup code?
