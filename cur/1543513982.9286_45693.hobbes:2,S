Well that IS what my modified ip_masq_select_addr() ends up doing.  I don't
like expanding the argument list like that, but i thought i'd follow what
was there.
It occurs to me now that by the skb passing a rtable struct, and giving
rt_src = to the actual source of the packet, it's only repeating data (as
ip_forward() is passed the skb, ip_forward can check the iph->s_addr
itself).  Instead of route.c calling rt_set_nexthop() shouldn't it do a
ip_route_output() and set rt_gateway rt_src via the result?
So the question here is why should ip_forward() choose a masquerading local
address?  Especially when ip_masquerade() is passed full information.  Why
doesn't ip_masquerade make up its mind, as it's a masquerading specific
spiel.  I follow.  For that matter why pass a maddr to ip_masquerade() at
all?  Just for NAT?
Take a look at my latest attempt and see if that works for you.  It's
working for me (functionally) but let's see if it's in the spirit of things
:)

It looks like the code in ip_masq_user drops out if maddr is set...
        if (ums->maddr)
                return 0;
...but continues on to ip_route_output() if it's not, in which case
ums->maddr=rt->rt_src is correct as you originally stated.
