Please Segher, just shut up.
The combining, which I've mentioned *multiple*times* is
	if (atomic_read(&x) <= 1)
and dammit, if that doesn't result in a *single* instruction, the code 
generation is pure and utter crap.
It should result in
	cmpl $1,offset(reg)
and nothing else. And there is no way in hell you are doing that with 
"atomic_read()" being inline asm.
So can you now just go away?
