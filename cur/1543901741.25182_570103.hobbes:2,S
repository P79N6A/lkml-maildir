Helper makes sense (and most of these places will become its call), but...
E.g. IIRC the change of UID requires CAP_CHOWN; CAP_FOWNER is not enough.
Ditto for change of GID.  setlease() is using CAP_LEASE and that appears
to be intentional (no idea what relevant standards say here)...
I'd suggest converting the obvious cases with new helper and taking the
rest one-by-one after that.  Some of those might want CAP_FOWNER added,
some not...
