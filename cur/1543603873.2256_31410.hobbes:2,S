That's what I meant, sorry for not making it clear.
I suppose in practise this would amount to using the number of _CPU
bound_ running tasks per CPU, since the non-CPU bound tasks would likely
be waiting rather than running? This would then be essentially
equivalent to (and simpler than) my proposal, i.e. using the sum of the
time slices.
