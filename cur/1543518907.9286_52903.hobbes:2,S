Hi everybody!
Can anybody enlighten me how can one pass something like "hda=x,y,z" to
modular IDE drivers? I mean fully modularized IDE with ide-mod,
ide-probe-mod and ide-disk in 2.3.3x. The problem is that newer big IDE
disks are not detected at all without such an option passed to the kernel
during boot.
I did read the kernel documentation but have not found how can those
parameters be passed to modularized IDE...
Any help is appreciated.
