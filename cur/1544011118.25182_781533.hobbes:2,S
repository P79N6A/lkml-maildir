It works (partly)!
I got an ethernet device with ifconfig, called ethX. And I can do some
scanning with iwlist!
What I can't do is: switching to another channel (with "iwconfig eth0
channel 9" f.e.) - my device is always on channel 3, but the only AP I
could connect to is channel 9. So - still - I can't proof that the
card's now able to build a wireless connection  with that driver. But
I'll keep going! Today, I've only got LXDE installed, but the next days
I'll try out gnome and it's network-manager and keep you up to date.
This is the output of "iwlist eth0 event":
eth0    Wireless Events supported :
        0x8B04 : Set Frequency/Channel (kernel generated)
        0x8B06 : Set Mode (kernel generated)
        0x8B13 : Spy threshold crossed
        0x8B15 : New Access Point/Cell address - roaming
        0x8B19 : Scan request completed
        0x8B1A  : Set ESSID (kernel generated)
        0x8B2A : Set Encoding (kernel generated)
        0xBC00 : Tx packet dropped - retry exceeded
I also tried the "echo ..." command you sent me with the wavelan_cs
driver - it gave me an ethernet device but I couldn't do nothing with
it: So, one thing is clear: The tuxmobil.org entry is wrong. orinoco_cs
is the right driver! (At least, it is better than the wavelan_cs
driver...)
Greetings and many thanks!
