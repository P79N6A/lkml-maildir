This seems to have been mostly the result of random memory corruption in
recent kernels.  If you can reproduce this in 2.2.12, we definitely want
to know.  One way to check what sort of corruptions may be occurring is
to copy a large file and "cmp" the two versions.  That very clearly
shows up the exact details of any memory overwrites going on.
