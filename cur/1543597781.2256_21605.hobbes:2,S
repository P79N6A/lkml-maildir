Completely agree. This is also why most big-iron shops employ a couple
of people to do change-management, AKA risk-management. And of course
they'll try to evaluate the risk in moving to the latest OS390 and/or Linux  
versus possible external threats. In the OS390 world, external threats
are limited, and being conservative often pays off very well. In the
Linux world, lots of systems have tight internet connections, and being
alert and uptodate will pay off. It all depends - there is no cure for all.

PS: is it customary to copy posters on a posting to lkml ? I don't
mind, but just to avoid flames.
