Please, add your BIOS into list of broken BIOSes and stop complaining ;-)
Your BIOS splitted 32MB G400 range into 16MB non-prefetchable d600-d6ff 
and 16MB prefetchable (d700-d7ff) range. Probably BIOS though that it
is setting G400 framebuffer at D7000000 for 32MB, but as D7000000 is not
multiple of 32MB, it cannot work.
You should try upgrading BIOS. If it does not help... you can try
kernel resources assigning code, but as it skips VGA adapters currently,
it is long way to go.
BTW, correct BIOS should put G400's resource #1 at D4000000, #2 at D4800000,
and #0 at D6000000. Programming non-prefetchable range for D400-D4FF,
and prefetchable as D600-D7FF... Leaving D5xx unused.
