Subject: [PATCH] [2/4]: Ext2/3 updates: Cleanup: Eliminate EXT3/2_DEF_RES[UG]ID
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/12/6

Cleanup: Eliminate EXT3/2_DEF_RES[UG]ID
Remove dead code.  Resuid and resgid (the user and group that is allowed
to allocate the last reserved_blocks worth of blocks on the filesystem)
can never be specified at compile time; the value in the superblock is
used, unless overidden by a mount option.  EXT3_DEF_RES[UG]ID is vestigal,
and should have been removed when the corresponding fields were added
to the superblock.  (In ext2fs, the code was removed in an earlier
cleanup, but the header file definitions weren't cleaned up.)
