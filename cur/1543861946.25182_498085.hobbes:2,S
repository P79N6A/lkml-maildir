well, yes, but it does raise a potential issue.  currently, that
ALIGN() macro is being used to define one of the members of that
structure.  since it's a "simple" macro, there's no problem.
but there are *plenty* of macros in the source tree that incorporate
either the "do-while" or "({ })" notation.  what the above implies is
that the ALIGN() macro can *never* be extended in that way because of
the way it's being used in the struct definition above, outside of a
function.
doesn't that place an unnecessarily limit on what might be done with
ALIGN() in the future?  because of how it's being used in that single
structure definition, it is forever restricted from being extended.
isn't that perhaps a dangerous restriction for any macro?
