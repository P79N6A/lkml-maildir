This patch adds code and EXPORT_SYMBOL's that bloat the kernel for 
everyone but are currently completely unused in the kernel with the sole 
justification
  "We use the idle notifier in the context of perfmon."
The people who whine loudly when I'm sending patches to remove code that 
is unused within the kernel should consider that they could save some 
tears when NAK'ing such patches until an actual user gets included in 
the kernel...
