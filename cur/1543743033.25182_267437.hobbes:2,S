It might have something to do whether dmix needs to convert the data or
not. In my case /proc shows that the card supports 48kHz but bmp plays a
44kHz file.

100% reproducable on my machine. I stopped debugging when I found out
that it happened somewhere deep inside the libalsa dmix core, the code
didn't look easy to follow.

This has something to do with dmix forking off a process, I don't know
exactly what it is for, it does something with the dmix unix socket
in /tmp.
