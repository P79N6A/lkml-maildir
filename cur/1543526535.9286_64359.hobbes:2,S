	Keep in mind the "-20" part refers to RedHat's build number,
rather than any official kernel version.  You have a choice; either you
can download their rpm's for a given kernel, or you can download the
.tar.gz for that kernel from linux.kernel.org or one of its mirrors.  The
latter choice is the only choice if you're trying to build a kernel
they've not yet released, as will be the case for a little while when
2.2.15 first comes out.

	Did you get any error messages when building the kernel?  It's
possible that including the 2.2.12 ramdisk is related to the problem; read
on.

	(Just for reference, once the kernel is built, System.map ends up
in /usr/src/linux.)  It looks like you copied it to /boot already; you
might simply want to make a symlink, such as:
cd /boot
ln -sf /System.map-2.2.14 System.map

	2.2.14 is probably a good choice, 2.2.15 should be out "soon".

	It might be worth commenting this out at some point as a test to
see if 2.2.14 correctly identifies the amount of memory in your system.

	 I think this is a poor choice.  That ramdisk was created with
modules specific to 2.2.12.
	As long as you're compiling a custom kernel for yourself, you
might as well include all the modules you'll need at boot time (ext2, ide,
and anything else needed to access your root filesystem), and then answer
"y" or "m" to all the other things you'll need.  The initrd (so useful in
a distribution's kernel, as they can modularize almost everything and so
provide a single kernel that should work with almost anyone's hardware) is
not needed when you compile your own.

	The kernel-howto includes more information on the necessary steps
in building a kernel.  I've written a program called Buildkernel that
automates the process - see my .sig.
