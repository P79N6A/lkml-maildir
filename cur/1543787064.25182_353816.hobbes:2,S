#define PID_MAX_DEFAULT (CONFIG_BASE_SMALL ? 0x1000 : 0x8000)
which is not that big (and on 32-bit systems PID_MAX_LIMIT is also
32K).

The initial patch added get_task_struct()/put_task_struct() calls to
fix this - are they forbidden too?

It at least has sigio_perm(), which prevents exploiting it to send
signals to tasks you don't have access to.

When using kill_proc_info() - yes, because it takes tasklist_lock
during its operation.  However, lookup by pid is not safe against pid
wrapping (at least without adding more checks like sigio_perm(), which
ensure that you can zap only your own process with that signal).
(Why they did not make a kind of "file descriptor" for processes...)
