   	Please consider pulling from:
   master.kernel.org:/home/acme/BK/ip-2.5
Pulled, thanks.
   PS.: Any feedback from the pppoe maintainer about seq_file patch?
None that I've seen :(
We should just put the changes in, if the maintainer really
cares he can revert them later after making his case.
Can you repost the changes in question?
