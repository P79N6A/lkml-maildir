Um... well, if we'll speak for easiness, then just "type" is more easy and
less error-prone than type + subtype. ;-) So, personally I see nothing
wrong with MAINS/USB/Battery/UPS power supply types. Though, as you may
noticed I'm easy to convince. ;-) So, if you'll elaborate it, I might
finally will see my wrongness.
Just in case I'll be convinced...
.type = POWER_SUPPLY_TYPE_MAINS,
.subtype = POWER_SUPPLY_SUBTYPE_USB,
Looks okay?
.type = POWER_SUPPLY_TYPE_MAINS,
.subtype = POWER_SUPPLY_SUBTYPE_AC,
And SUBTYPE_AC looks not good already, because we indeed tried to
avoid AC/DC meanings in type fields, because current_type attribute
will be better. So, what subtype name we should use?
.type = POWER_SUPPLY_TYPE_BATTERY,
.subtype = POWER_SUPPLY_SUBTYPE_????,
What should be in "????" for plain batteries? Should UPS be
subtype of battery type?
.type = POWER_SUPPLY_TYPE_MAINS,
.subtype = POWER_SUPPLY_SUBTYPE_UPS,
Just wrong.
So, notice that subtype brings complications, not solves them.
Thanks!
