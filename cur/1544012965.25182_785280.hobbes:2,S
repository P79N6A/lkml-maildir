I've found the problem.  cap_capable() ignores the fact that if tsk is the
current process, then it should perhaps be using the effective/subjective
creds of the current process.  Instead it always uses the real/objective creds
of whatever process it is given.
I've attached a patch to fix it, but I think that this patch is probably the
wrong fix.  It attempts to divine whether the caller of cap_capable() meant to
use the objective or the subjective creds depending on whether the task
specified is current or not.
A better way to do things would be to differentiate capable() from
has_capability() all the way down to cap_capable().  Thus capable() would use
the subjective creds and has_capability() the objective.

Subject: [PATCH] CRED: Fix regression in cap_capable() as shown up by sys_faccessat()
Fix a regression in cap_capable() due to:
	commit 5ff7711e635b32f0a1e558227d030c7e45b4a465
	Author: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

	    CRED: Differentiate objective and effective subjective credentials on a task
The problem is that the above patch allows a process to have two sets of
credentials, and for the most part uses the subjective credentials when
accessing current's creds.
There is, however, one exception: cap_capable(), and thus capable(), uses the
real/objective credentials of the target task, whether or not it is the current
task.
Ordinarily this doesn't matter, since usually the two cred pointers in current
point to the same set of creds.  However, sys_faccessat() makes use of this
facility to override the credentials of the calling process to make its test,
without affecting the creds as seen from other processes.
One of the things sys_faccessat() does is to make an adjustment to the
effective capabilities mask, which cap_capable(), as it stands, then ignores.
The affected capability check is in generic_permission():
	if (!(mask & MAY_EXEC) || execute_ok(inode))
		if (capable(CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE))
			return 0;
This can be tested by compiling the following program from the XFS testsuite:

This can be run against an Ext3 filesystem as well as against an XFS
filesystem.  If successful, it will show:
