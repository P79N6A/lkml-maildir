For what its worth, I run about 16 production linux boxes, as well as
my three "home" machines that I use for development.
Yesterday I ran 8 copies of bonnie in parallel (incl at least one on
each filesystem simultaneously), while also running crashme and
lmbench, and doing several large find/gzip/tar bits and bobs at the
same time on my home machine under 2.2.10-ac3 SMP. I can safely say
that 2.2 stability is pretty good.  Yes it is a SCSI box.
In production I have had two 2.2 SMP servers with more than 40 days
uptime.  We have had oopses, and we have hit the fs corruption bug,
however I don't feel that we have had too rough a time.  We have
certainly had more than 99% uptime on both these machines, and have
been running 2.2 in production since 2.2.0 
I think it is strange to say that "not everyone has a serial port to
contribute to linux development" while still expecting everyone else
to donate time and effort to finding and fixing bugs you can't even be
bothered to report.  You could:
a)Get another serial port
b)Buy a second-hand 386 as a logging machine.  You can get a new 486
for £40 here, so I don't think a second-hand 386 is too much.
Otherwise, you could temporarily retreat to 2.0.x and watch out for
stability reports on your hardware.  Either way, you have to accept
that if you run marginal hardware that the developers don't use you
are likely to encounter some difficulties. If you are not prepared to
report the stuff you find, how do you expect linux to get more stable
on your hardware?
