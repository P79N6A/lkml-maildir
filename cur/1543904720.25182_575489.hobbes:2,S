i'm not opposed to this fundamentally, but it would be nice to better 
map the effects of this change: do you have any particular workload 
under which you've tested this and under which you've seen it makes a 
difference? I'd expect this to improve fork-intense half-idle workloads 
perhaps - things like a make -j3 on a 4-core CPU.
