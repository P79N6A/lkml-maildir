hey, that's what i thought when i helped do the vDSO, until i got 
slapped with cold reality called "CONFIG_COMPAT_VDSO". I'm a bit more 
careful about ABIs since then =B-)

ok, sure, how about the one i mentioned: long-term i'd like to have a 
paravirt model where the guest does not store /any/ page tables - all 
paging is managed by the hypervisor. The guest has a vma tree, but 
otherwise it does not process pagefaults, has no concept of a pte (if in 
paravirt mode), has no concept of kernel page tables either: there are 
hypercalls to allocate/free guest-kernel memory, etc. This needs some 
(serious) MM surgery but it's doable and it's interesting as well. How 
would you map this to the VMI backend?
