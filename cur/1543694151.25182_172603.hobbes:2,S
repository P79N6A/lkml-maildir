It's probably mostly because Vojtech changed the samplerate from 200 to
60. Here's a patch to change it back. I've sent it to Vojtech but he's
completely ignored it so far. This patch also readds the fallback logic
that was used before his change, although it uses the new
samplerate-table.
Without this patch my mouse is awful to use.
Vojtech, please consider this patch, at least say yay or nay.
