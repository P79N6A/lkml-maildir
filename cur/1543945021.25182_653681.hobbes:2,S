problem is that i have to upgrade the kernel from 2.4 to 2.6 series and
i have to have access to all the EAs after upgrade. Is there a way to
read user EAs off of symlinks on an XFS filesystem on a 2.6 kernel
either from userspace or from a filter driver sitting between VFS and
XFS filesystem code?

If you want to do it at user code level, you could note the symlink, 
follow it to the "real" name, and read the EA there. I don't see any 
easy way to force the kernel to follow the symlink.
