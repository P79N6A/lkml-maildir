Hi Victor,
Thank you for your response but at the moment it is not obvious (to me)
whether this is indeed a winmodem. If so, I will have it either refunded
or start learning the wisdom of reverse engineering. But 3com's web site
mentions various models under "USR 56k PCI modem" and only one of them is
winmodem.
Surely, I always laughed at humans buying winmodems - are you saying I
fell into the trap myself!? (or my wife, at least :)
So, I will have to check carefully what exactly is the model and then
decide what to do, unless you are confident that *ALL* the PCI USR 56K
modems from 3COM are winmodems? Are you?
Regards,
