Thanks, that helps me not duplicate anything.  One of the first ones I
was looking at (before your post) was viotape.c, which is in your patch
set.  However, looking at the uses of the semaphore, I see that on line
409-410 the following code:
        if (noblock)
                return count;
which seems to ignore the fact that the semaphore has been downed (not
to mention the dma buffer and op struct allocations.  I think it should be:
	if (noblock)
		ret = count;
		goto free_dma;
instead.  Do you want to make sure I'm right about that and fold it into
your patch?  Or have you already submitted your patch (or should it be
in a separate patch?  Alternatively, I can submit the patch if you don't
want to bother with it.
