Can someone please tell us how this magic works?  (And it does appear to
work).
It seems to assuming that the compiler will assume that members of packed
structures can have arbitrary alignment, even if that alignment is obvious.
Which makes sense, but I'd like to see chapter-and-verse from the spec or
from the gcc docs so we can rely upon it working on all architectures and
compilers from now until ever more.
IOW: your changlogging sucks ;)
