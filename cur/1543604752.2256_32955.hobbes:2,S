Also, I'd like to say about the documentation...
<quote>
Currently, these files are in /proc/sys/vm:
- bdflush
- buffermem
- freepages
- kswapd
- overcommit_memory
- page-cluster
- pagecache
- pagetable_cache
</quote>
but a simple ls of /proc/sys/vm reports:
bdflush  kswapd  overcommit_memory  page-cluster  pagetable_cache
Shouldnt the documentation be updated, seeing for the fact it was written in the 2.2.10 days?

(Enough so that my mouse pointer will freeze in X that its swapping so much. Swapping is the only thing ive found that can pull that off) Swapping the least ammount would be the best for a box like that.
