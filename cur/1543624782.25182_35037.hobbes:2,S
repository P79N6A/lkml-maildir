I'm certainly not a "vim genius", but somehow I managed to write some
vim autocmds that do this ;-)
You can get the vim script from
    
http://www.myipv6.de/vim/extensions/bk.vim
Simply source it from your .vimrc. I tested it with vim 6.0 only,
although it should also work with prior versions.
On open, it tries to checkout a file from bitkeeper if it isn't
already checked out (doing "bk get" if you open it readonly and "bk
edit" otherwise), and it "bk edit"s the file if you start making
changes to a readonly bitkeeper controlled file.
Unfortunately, vim doesn't trigger the FileChangedRO autocmd if you do
a ":set readonly!" to go from readonly to read/write, so it doesn't
handle this case (AFAIK there is no way to intercept this command).
