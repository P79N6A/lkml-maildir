With your changes, I wouldn't be surprised to find an entirely
non-random measurement error.  You're messing with scheduling quanta,
and thats exactly where measurement tends to misrepresent what's going
on.  But...

One way to test this directly is to run a second process at the same
time that does:
  while (1) {
    i = 0;
    time = read_tsc ();
    while (read_tsc () - time < 1 second)
      i++;
    printf( "%d loops per second\n", i );
  }
The inner loop should be written to use as little cache footprint as
possible of course.
If your patch really works, then xmms will use less CPU and this will
get more cycles.
have a nice day,
