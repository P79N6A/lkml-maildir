Not even that. Suppose a userspace program (whose output you'd like
to discard) does:
int main(void)
{
	int fd = open("/nullmnt/foo.txt", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL);
	/* write lots of nonsensical data that we don't need anyway */
	write(fd, "Hello Wor(l)d", 13);
	if (lseek(fd, 0, SEEK_SET) < 0) {
		/* should not happen */
		fprintf(stderr, "Huh, did we write to a pipe or cdev?\n");
		abort();
	}
	/* verify */
	char buf[13];
	read(fd, buf, 13);
	if (memcmp(buf, "Hello Wor(l)d", 13) != 0)
		fprintf(stderr, "Aïe, disk corruption!\n");
}

I agree.
