Yes, I know KURT, but I still think that the 
low-latency patch + running apps with SCHED_FIFO and mlockall()
solves most of multimedia very well,
and ofter you need not periodic scheduling but fast response time to
external events.
For example a MIDI synth implemented in software:
you have to react very fast to an incoming MIDI command on the MIDI input
and render the note in form of audio samples to send to the soundcard's DAC
using very small buffers (ideal would be <5-10ms).
Plus consider the fact that we all want Linux to become a good
desktop/multimedia OS soon, without being forced to install special kernels,
tools etc  
Since Ingo's lowlatency work is not a radical change, but is based on
adding pre-emption points at critical points in the kernel,
(and reducing execution paths) it will go almost certainly into linux 2.4.
And once Linux will provide "sub-millisecond scheduling latencies"
out of the box , people will begin to see it as a serious alternative to other
multimedia OSes.
The only thing I miss in linux is the UTIME stuff, it would be really nice to
schedule things with microsecond resolution.
But meanwhile we can use other tricks to achieve sub-ms accuracy,
for example by using the RTC clock combined with the RDTSC instruction.
Or when playing audio one could use audio small fragments, and derive the timing
from it.
Benno.
