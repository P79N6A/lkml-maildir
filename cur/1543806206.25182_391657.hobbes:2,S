I'm betting this is the same thing I'm seeing. Are you running on a
uniprocessor x86_64? And if so are you seeing messages similar to the
following?
init[1]: segfault at ffffffff8010fadc rip ffffffff8010fadc rsp
00007fffffdacfc8 
If so, then I suspect that you're getting a segfault in ld.so (at least
that's the furthest I've gotten so far). Something about how the kernel
sets up the memory map is upsetting dynamically loaded executables. I
can boot with init=/sbin/sash, but when I try and run a dynamically
linked program, I get segfaults. 
You might try turning off LATENCY_TRACING and see if that allows you to
boot and run (works for me).
Meanwhile, I'm going to try and pin this down to something better than
"somewhere in ld.so..."
