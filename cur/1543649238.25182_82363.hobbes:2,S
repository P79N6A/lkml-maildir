He had 3 million dentries and only 100k pages on the LRU,
so we should have been reclaiming 60 dentries per scanned
page.
Conceivably the multiply in shrink_slab() overflowed, where
we calculate local variable `delta'.  But doubtful.
First, we need to make it happen again, then see if this (quick
hack) fixes it up.
