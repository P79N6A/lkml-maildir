Hi,
This series of patches is intended to eliminate some design problems with the
hibernation userland interface.
It contains the following changes:
* allow the user space utilities to get the size of the image via ioctl
* introduce ioctls to be used instead of SNAPSHOT_PMOPS
* mark the SNAPSHOT_SET_SWAP_FILE ioctl as deprecated
* introduce new ioctl definitions to replace the wrongly defined ones
* move the definitions of hibernation ioctls to a separate header file located
  in include/linux/ and export them to the user space
The details are in the changelogs.
Comments welcome.
Greetings,
Rafael
