Who is changing the use count? How do you ensure that someone doesn't
cache a reference past that magic sync point?
IMO the real problem is that cleanup_module() can't fail. If modules
already do proper data acounting, it's not too difficult to detect if
there still exists a reference. In the driverfs example the problem is
that remove_driver() returns void instead of int, so it can't fail.
