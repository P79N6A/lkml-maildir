Hi,
	Sorry for the trouble. I have worked out what is going on.
I have been using Cygwin, but I has assumed incorrectly that MS WindowsXP
SP2, like MS Windows 2000, honered mixed case filenames correctly. This is
not the case making MS WindowsXP SP2 Pro non POSIX complient (what a
supprise). A quick google search sugests that I am not the only person
to have issues with this.
Is there any chance that at some point in the future, the kernel filenames
will be changed so that dumb OS like MS Windows don't mess it all up ?
Regards
	Mark Fortescue.
