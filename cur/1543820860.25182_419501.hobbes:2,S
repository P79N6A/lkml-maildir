Subject: Why the RPC task structure adds a new field "tk_count"?

I migrate from 2.6.11 to 2.6.16, but found that a new field tk_count
was added to the rpc task structure. In function rpc_release_task(), I
saw the following code:
	if (!atomic_dec_and_test(&task->tk_count))
		return;
Looks like a task can be reused or refered multiple times? What's the
theory behind this? Why do we need this?
Thanks,
Xin
