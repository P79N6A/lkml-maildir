Subject: [PATCH] Override 80-wire cable detection for Toshiba S1800-814

Hi!
Please CC me, as I'm currently not subscribed to this list, thx.
Attached patch will add above mentioned Laptop Model to whitelist for both 
pata_ali and alim15x3, as it is correctly detected as 40-wire connected but 
this cable is short enough to still do transfers higher than UDMA33.
Don't know if this is also true for other S1800 Laptops cause I own only one.
I hope I did this correctly as this is my first Patch Mail to LKML :)
