I did some more tests (I'm becoming a big fan of the ext3 filesystem).
The lockup also occurs with older kernels like 2.6.0-test1 and 2.4.20.
A sure way to reproduce the problem is running the following one-liner
with a DOS floppy in the drive:
  find / & mdir
Disabling DMA with "hdparm -d0" doesn't help, although the kernel
messages are different. I now get:
  hda: lost interrupt
What could be the cause for this. Is my hardware dying? And if yes,
what part? Any tips on how to isolate this problem? I know for sure
that my floppy worked two months ago, but I don't known when it worked
for the last time.
