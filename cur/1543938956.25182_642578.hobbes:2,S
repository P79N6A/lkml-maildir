I think I'm going to just switch the memory modules. If the problem
persists maybe memtest will be able to shed some light on the problem.
Good thing, the weekend is coming.

Hmm. Good thinking. But the system ran perfectly stable with a
Core2Duo E6600 and the same amount of hard drives. There are dedicated
power supplies with enough juice for the devices and for the mainboard
with the CPU and the usual PCI/PCIe cards.
I'll have a closer look at the whole hardware thing at the weekend.
Thanks for the fast responses.
