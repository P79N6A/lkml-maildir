I've been holding off on making many changes to PnP at the moment,
because I have been considering replacing it with a new (more modern and
ACPI capable) ISA/LPC bridge driver.  This work would likely begin after
my PCI bridge driver rewrite is finished and merged (as the PCI work is
in some ways a prerequisite).

Still, if there are changes to fix actual bugs, then I'm all for them.
Also a few features could be added.  Specifically PnPBIOS
hotplug/docking station support.  If anyone's interested, I may
implement it (and it would use some functions that were removed by this
patch).  Furthermore, ISAPnP could be made a module.  PnPBIOS probably
couldn't.

Correct.

Not that I'm aware of.
So in short, I'd rather not remove them, because they take away from the
original design of the PnP layer.
Thanks,
Adam
