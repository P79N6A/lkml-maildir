They're raw values as provided by the ADC. Collie will have a different
ADC and hence different raw values. There's no real need to convert them
to mV and back again all the time.

The battery levels are totally different between the models and each is
going to need a levels translation table as its an extremely none linear
decay curve. Using ADC values here makes a lot of sense as that's as
granular as the information ever gets and you don't start to lose
accuracy anywhere with rounding.
I still think you've much bigger problems to worry about as this code is
heavily PXA biased and is going to need a lot of changes to work on the
SA1100. Its why I've put it in mach-pxa rather than common and a
separate driver for collie based on this code might be easier.
