Just a caution, I suspect that this is related to something happening in
a small time window, and identical configs might not work the same on
different machines. Interrupt timing can be changed by disk layout,
rotational speed of the drive, interrupt priority, maybe even a user
event like keystroke or mouse action.
Comparing configs will help, but may not be consistent.
