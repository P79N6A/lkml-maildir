That appears to have cleared it up. I tried the tests I discovered in my
earlier e-mail of creating bogus lost+found etc... and couldn't get the
filesystem to fail. Mind you, I only ran an rsync over a 2GB filesystem,
but previously the problem was exhibited 100% of the time. I'll bang on
this for a while. Hopefully you don't hear back from me right away :)
Thanks,
