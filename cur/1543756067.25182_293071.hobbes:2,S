Many thanks for your help,
I'm using a TI-PCI4510 on a Dell Inspiron 8500.
Kernel is linux-2.6.11-rc3 and your patch is already included there.
I tried to load the module with 'disable_clkrun' option but nothing has
changed... :-(
dmesg extract:

It is perhaps that IRQ11 is shared with a lot of other devices?
