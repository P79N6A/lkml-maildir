Yeah, that seems like the best thing to do in the long run.  Of course it 
has to wait until libata at least has ATAPI support I'd imagine.  Jeff 
also mentioned that it would require changes to the legacy IDE driver to 
prevent it from binding to certain PCI devices (and given that it just 
uses I/O ports that might get hackish).
