Well it works ok with 2.6.22 powering off and saying so right before
powering off, with some references to ACPI. On 2.6.23-rc8 however it doesn't
seem to get that far.
I have followed the poweroff of my distro (Debian unstable) and on getting
to the end of rc 0 it calls halt with options -d -f -i -p. So it does call
it with the -p you asked for. BTW, this halt comes fom Debian's sysvinit
version 2.86.ds1-38.1 in case that matters, but as I said it is working ok
for .22.

That init.d/halt is the one that is calling halt with -d -f -i -p already.
