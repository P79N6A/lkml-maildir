I'm not sure I agree that there's no point. If we shove half the 
overhead into highmem (well, maybe 1/3 depending if on your PTE size), 
we can fit a workload double the size. Not to be sniffed at. 50% of 
the benefit at 5% of the cost.
No, it doesn't completely solve the problem, but it's another hammer
to give it a good sturdy whack over the head with.
