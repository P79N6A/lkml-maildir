It is only a temporary accident that it appears easy to undo this
change, because the resource management changes are being done in an
incremental fashion.  The "leaving info around" is going to happen
because it's the whole point.  To safely configure a new device,
you've got to know what resources are used by other hardware, whether
or not a driver happens to currently own those resources.  At the
moment, the only things leaving info around are the existing drivers,
but soon that info will be left around by the PCI subsystem and some
PnP code.
A consequence of this is that if multiple drivers use one piece of
hardware, they're going to have to agree on what resource ranges
describe that piece of hardware, and not try to grab arbitrary subsets
of resources.  That seems like a reasonably minor restriction.
