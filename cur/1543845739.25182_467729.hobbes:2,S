Thanks James and Erich for your great work in getting this driver
ready for inclusion and making sure it will be in 2.6.19.  It will
be nice to not have to apply the patch to every kernel I build!

    [SCSI] arcmsr: fix up sysfs values
    The sysfs files in arcmsr are non-standard in that they aren't simple
    filename value pairs, the values actually contain preceeding text which
    would have to be parsed.  The idea of sysfs files is that the file name
    is the description and the contents is a simple value.
    Fix up arcmsr to conform to this standard.
