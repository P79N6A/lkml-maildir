not ANSI C :-)  plan9 C added the `becomes' keyword which behaves
like return except that it doesn't construct a new stack frame.
their rationale was that the programmer can tell when this is possible
(and necessary) much more easily than the compiler can.
however, they seem to have dropped it from release 3 as i can't find it
in the reference pages.
