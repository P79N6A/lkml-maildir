The only libata change I can see that could possibly affect your setup,
is this one here, which went in sometime between -rc7 and -final:
--- linux-2.6.24-rc7/drivers/ata/libata-eh.c    2008-01-06 16:45:38.000000000 -0500
+++ linux-2.6.24/drivers/ata/libata-eh.c        2008-01-24 17:58:37.000000000 -0500
@@ -1733,11 +1733,15 @@
               ehc->i.action &= ~ATA_EH_PERDEV_MASK;
       }
-       /* consider speeding down */
+       /* propagate timeout to host link */
+       if ((all_err_mask & AC_ERR_TIMEOUT) && !ata_is_host_link(link))
+               ap->link.eh_context.i.err_mask |= AC_ERR_TIMEOUT;
+
It looks pretty innocent to me, though.
If you want to try reverting just that change
(comment out the two lines and rebuild),
then that might provide useful information here.
If -final is still b0rked even with those two lines changed back,
then I suspect you're just "getting lucky" when switching between
the -rc7/-rc8 kernel and the -final kernel.
"Lucky" in a bad way, that is.
The real test would be to rebuild the kernel without libata,
and *with* the old IDE driver instead, and see if the problems persist.
If you need help with that, then perhaps someone familiar with Fedora
might be able to assist.
