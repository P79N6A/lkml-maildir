For my local setup it is already a minor PITA that there is no tool
combining the functionality of arptables, ebtables and iptables, but
I can cope with the help of marking and ipt_physdev. If that doesn't
work reliably anymore, I'll be stuck.
Wasn't someone working on a unified framework for *tables? IIRC that
would have been pkttables, but Harald(?) said there was not much
code there yet.
