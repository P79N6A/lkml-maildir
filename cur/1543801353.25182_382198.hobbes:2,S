Soft mixing is performed by writing to allocated shared memory block.
Try to use SELinux on dissalow use SHM only for mixing souds.
In case performing ALL (possible) mixing tricks you have SINGLE point of 
entry from any application. Using SHM with r/w permission allow one
allicattions dump sound streams writed by other applications.

Moment .. are you want to say: there is no compact mixing abstraction 
layer in ALSA because because ALSA is developed by believers ? (not 
technicians/enginers ?)
Sorry .. be so kind and try to answer on my question using only stricte

Hmm .. if "ALSA is developed by belivers" slowny now I undestand .. all 
this :>

Not true. Download OSS from opensound. You can find in soundcard.h 
AFMT_S24_PACKED define.

Are you want say something like: architesture of OSS is so bad there is no 
civilized way for extending this ? (except: chorus/reverb are now handled 
by comercial OSS).
Correct me if I'm wrong: his not true.

Completly disagee.
And another argument: comercial OSS have ALSA emulation and ALSA have OSS 
emulation.
So .. there is no general architecture problems on implemting both varians 
(in both variants sits only some implementation bugs).
This unhides one fact: *ALSA and OSS are mostly izomorphic* (look on 
similarities ALSA and OSS device drivers architecture).
And if it is true there was/is no strong arguments for droping OSS and 
replace this by ALSA. As I sayd ALSA is only on Linux. Using OSS allow 
easier develpment soud support in user space applications for some group 
of currently used unices. This is IMO strong argument .. much stronger 
than existing or not group of belivers. For me now switching to ALSA have 
only *political groud* .. nothing more. Interesting .. how long Linux can 
survive without looking on some economic aspects ?
If you allow .. EOT
