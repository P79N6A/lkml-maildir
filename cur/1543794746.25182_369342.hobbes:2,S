Opps, misread your mail. Sorry.
But in that case, why shall we have any pci_*-function in the first 
place when !CONFIG_PCI? As it was before, they were contained within 
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI's.
You said your patch were easier to read, please elaborate. Yes, in the 
dgrs_init_module() (no arguments there), but you introduces new 
functions (who need to be checked out if you read the code for the first 
time) and is really #ifdef's a good idea to change function behavior? 
Isn't better to change the input? (I know, linux/pci.h does it, but at 
least that is in a .h-file with inline functions containing at most 
"return 0;").
Btw, you said Jeff should decide. Why not Rich Richardson who is the author?
Apologize for the ranting.
As I said before, thinking of deleting CONFIG_PCI's containing 
pci_*-functions and if so, need a valid plan for it (because of the 
pci_driver-struct). If there is any no-no in "my" way, please point it 
out to spare me/you/lkml the patches. If not for this, I would've let 
this rest and leave it to Jeff (or Rich ;) ).
cu,
Richard
