Explain to me how a kernel compiled with
        CONFIG_SERIO=m
        CONFIG_KEYBOARD_ATKBD=m
would be able to boot with "init=/bin/sh" and still have the keyboard
working.
I've just verified that "make allmodconfig", which is what many people
are tempted  to do once they've  learnt about it, will  produce such a
.config.
