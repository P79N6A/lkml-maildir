The last time I looked at snort it created a tcpdump capture file of the
days activity.  I remember seeing the behaviour you describe in an earlier
release, so either you have an old version (which you should probably
update given snort's sketchy security hole history), or theres a configuration
option that you might be able to fiddle with to get it to work in capture-file
mode.
Either way, it's got to be easier than hacking ext3 code 8)
