clear_inode() <- dispose_list() <- prune_icache().
IOW, if file still exists, but is closed by everyone, etc. you _can_
get clear_inode() on it. <thinks> Ah, I see your point. OK, how about that:
	* clear_inode() _can_ be called for still-alive objects.
	* no matter how it is called, we don't give a damn for the stuff
on the list.
	* moreover, if it gets called for object that is still alive the
list is just empty. It doesn't contain anything valuable (as in every
case) _and_ it doesn't contain random crap.
If that's what you were talking about - fine with me.
