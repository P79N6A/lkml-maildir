JFYI: I reproduced too on my UP athlon. I run:
	tcpblast -d0 -s 40481 another_host 9000
two times and after the second it locked hard. I didn't had any fork
bomb at the same time but there was an high computing load in the
background.
the nic is:
Ethernet controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] 79c970 [PCnet LANCE] (rev 36)
