Did you write this from scratch?  I've got a DP83815 driver from National.  It was written against
2.2.14 and I ported it to 2.4.0test-X
If you're working on the same driver I could give you my 2.4 patches.  National wanted to take my
patches in-house, set up some kind of support structure and then finally let me submit the driver to
the kernel.  I've got a lot of other work so I haven't been pushing it.
If Donald has written one too, that's kind of a bummer that NSC didn't get their crap together faster
and out the bloody driver.
