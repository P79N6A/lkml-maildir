I think you're talking past each other.
Trond noticed that kfree_skb() can be called from a _non_ bh context, ie
process context. So it needs to protect itself against other bh's on this
CPU (which it wouldn't need to do if it was only called from a bh
context).
So it's exactly your "better context" that is at stake here.
