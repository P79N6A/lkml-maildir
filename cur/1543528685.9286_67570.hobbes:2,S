At least on trains they use Windows 3.1 (!) and soon "Embedded NT" for
the status displays for the train driver. I know from one of the guys
who (must) write software for it. They shot down Linux because the
company (for the germans: In Erlangen, you may guess now which
one... ;-) ) is committed to MS-OS.
Hint: Don't step on board of the new german high speed trains...
