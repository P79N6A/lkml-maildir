You're right, the cast is meaningless and should be removed. It's an artifact
of a macro that had several iterations of development.

Yep, they're useless. I had introduced them merely to be consistent with
how the other macros in asm-ia64/atomic.h were done (macros that I didn't
modify). But the parentheses can be removed.
Thanks for the corrections.
