Is it less pain than making something like a memory allocation which comes
out of a deep stack? Say, nfs server -> filesystem -> lvm/raid -> fiber channel,
which itself does something like a writepage into an nfs filesystem and ends
up in the networking stack? OK, getting back into the filesystem on a
memory allocation from the block layer should not happen, but you could
certainly be down in the bowels of the first filesystem when this happens.
There are other combinations which worry me. I do wonder how close to the
edge some of these are living now and cutting them off at the knees, stack
wise, is going to bite later. How many folks run the mm kernel in production
server environments?
Maybe there should be a competition to see how convoluted a stack you can
generate out of the kernel ;-)
