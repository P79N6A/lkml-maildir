If the value of the HPET_T0_CMP register is reached and exceeded
by the value of the HPET_COUNTER register after HPET_T0_CMP is
read into trigger, but before the first iteration of the while,
the while loop will iterate "endlessly" until the HPET overlaps
eventually (in as much as 5 minutes).

Yes, making trigger unsigned is a good idea (although having it
signed would probably never cause any problem, because this is
called during boot and it takes ~2 minutes for HPET to overflow
the s32)
But no, looping while the unsigned result is >= 0 does not seem
that good an idea to me ;-)
An updated patch follows. It is still not wraparound safe (a
lockup would still happen if it's called ~5 minutes after boot, but
this should never happen -- it's called early during boot)
