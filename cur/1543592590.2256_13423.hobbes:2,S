On 'ac' kernels at MDK, only when initrd is used, we are seeing the root
filesystem mounted read-write, no matter what rdev and bootloader
settings are...  Things are fine with no initrd.
I looked at the root_mountflags usage and it looks ok, so I put it in
the "figure out later" pile.
Haven't yet verified if this 'ac' only problem....
