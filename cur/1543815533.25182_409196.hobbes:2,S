I don't think they're all that different conceptually.  If something as
simple as this was merged then we'd at least have a common structure to
throw things in, and a common syscall infrastructure that can gracefully
handle kernel API versioning without requiring dozens of syscalls.

Please read "vx_info" as "container" (or your preferred term).  I
decided to punt on the naming issue and copy Herbert :-).
And also because the acronym "vx" makes the API look nice, at least to
mine and Herbert's eyes, then when you go to the network virtualisation
you get "nx_info", etc.  However I'm thinking any of these terms might
also be right:
  - "vserver" spelt in full
  - family
  - container
  - jail
  - task_ns (sort for namespace)
Perhaps we can get a ruling from core team on this one, as it's
aesthetics :-).

This patch is simple, but does not handle SMP scalability very well
(you'll get a lot of cacheline problems when you start actually using
the container structure; the hashing helps a lot there), and does not
provide functions such as looking up a container by ID etc.  I think
Herbert's context.c is a pretty nice basic set of functions for dealing
with container-like things.
Thanks for your feedback!
Sam.
