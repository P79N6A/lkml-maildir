Restarting from exit() is only an option, leaving the module in the
cleanup state (once it started with the cleanup) is no error.

I was talking about network drivers in general. pci drivers can be stopped
simply with pci_unregister_driver().
To get struct net_device in first place you need the name of the device,
so you can deconfigure it (otherwise the driver stays busy).
For example ISA network drivers are currently not registered as drivers
themselves, only the devices they manage are registered. start()/stop()
does only start/stop (or register/unregister) the driver _not_ the
devices.

Could you please explain how this is related to what I wrote above?

Have you understood what I wrote? I was talking about worst case behaviour
and you talk about locking???

That case is actually quite trivial. If one device fails to unload, it can
always set itself back to the stopped/running state, the active devices
will continue to work fine. If you want the other devices back you can
start a new bus scan.
Note a the driver cleanup itself only starts when all devices are gone,
until then it can always go back at least to the stopped state. A driver
in the stopped state can get no new users, so there is nothing to race
with.
The cleanup stage is only needed for usage which you don't return with
usecount() (usually proc entries). So if you only use
pci_register_driver() you only need to call pci_unregister_driver() in
stop() and remove the devices in exit() until the refcnt is zero. Until
then the driver stays in the stopped state, you could even call start
again and everything is working again (Practically it needs a few more
changes in driverfs, but it should show the basic idea.)
bye, Roman
PS: Could you please at least try to understand what I wrote before you
start flaming, your answer came a bit too quick for that. :(
