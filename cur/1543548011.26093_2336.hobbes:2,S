I don't know whether lilo has trouble. But if it has
that is easily avoidable by adding the "linear" keyword.
And fdisk does not have trouble. It just warns you.
These warnings can be ignored. You can also avoid them
by giving the kernel hdc=C,H,S boot parameters.

Maybe there was no gain. The kernel comes with an educated guess,
satisfactory in 99% of the cases. Even if the guess improves
there will be people for whom it gets worse. This change was
an improvement for a handful of people and now we find that
it may require you to use boot parameters (or suffer looking
at warnings).
