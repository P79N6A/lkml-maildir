Hi!
So another flamewar is over, good. I even received one apology ;-),
and probably should have sent some apologies, too...
Anyway, it means that suspend is still quite a hot topic, and that is
good. (Linus said that suspend-to-disk is basically for people that
can't get suspend-to-RAM to work, and after I got suspend-to-RAM to
work reliably here, I can see his point).
Anyway, uswsusp project needs your help. It is basically working, see
www.sf.net/projects/suspend , and it is already faster then in-kernel
version. How you could help?
* testing is useful at this point. Few confirmations that it works in
different configurations would make us feel warm and fuzzy. 
* documentation improvements, and small scripts. Having script that
prepares initrd would be nice, for example. 
* having someone to maintain suspend.sf.net web pages / release CVS
snapshot as package would help, too.
* userspace code improvements. Encryption, LZW and graphical progress
should be reasonably easy to do. There's some tricky stuff, if you
prefer -- support for swap files and normal files would help,
too. Plus I guess everyone has their favourite feature...
