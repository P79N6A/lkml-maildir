That very point came up recently in a MMC meeting:
http://www.t10.org/ftp/t10/document.05/05-056r0.pdf
To confuse things further "ATA_16" is shown as opcode 0x98
in the latest draft of SPC-3 (rev 21c 15 January 2005)
http://www.t10.org/ftp/t10/drafts/spc3/spc3r21c.pdf
 [annex D.3.1].
Hopefully these matters will be sorted out at the next t10
meeting in March.
