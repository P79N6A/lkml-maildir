Known issue.
The problem is that the floppy driver is broken since the block I/O
and VFS changes in 2.5.13. I have a partial fix, which you can get from
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/patches/2.5/patch-fix-floppy-2.5.22
or from the current -dj patch kit, but it only repairs raw access so
things like tar/dd to/from /dev/fd0 work. VFS access to mounted floppies
causes data corruption, but I have no fix in sight for that yet.
