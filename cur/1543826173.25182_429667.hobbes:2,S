You could lower the obvious values in this code from drivers/usb/core/hub.c
	if (hdev == hdev->bus->root_hub) {
		if (hdev->bus_mA == 0 || hdev->bus_mA >= 500)
			hub->mA_per_port = 500;
		else {
			hub->mA_per_port = hdev->bus_mA;
			hub->limited_power = 1;
		}
If that does the job we need to somehow inherit the power supply maximum from
PCI when we allocate the root hub's device structure.
