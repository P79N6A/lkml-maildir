So eth0 now randomly changes between on board and PCMCIA depending upon
whether the PCMCIA card was inserted or not, and your disks re-order
themselves in the same situation. That'll be funny if anyone does a
mkswap to share their swap between Linux and Windows. Gosh look there
goes the root partition.
I'm hoping thats not what you are implying. Especially for disks,
network is much much less of an issue.
