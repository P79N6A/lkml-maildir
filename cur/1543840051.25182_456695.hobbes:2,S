Hi,
I was wondering about the differences between the aperture size types defined in agp.h. As far as I understand the size_value field in the aper_size_info_8/16/32 structs just defines the value to be set in the AGP bridge registers to configure a specific AGP aperture size (e.g. 8 MB, 16MB, etc..).
Wouldn't it be sufficient to define size_value as 32 bit only, or does the type of size_value/aper_size_info_x have an influence on the generation of the graphics address remapping table (e.g. address alignment) ?
For example the uninorth driver uses the aper_size_info_32 struct to define the AGP aperture size, but only defines values between 1 and 64 for the size_value field (so aper_size_info_8 would be sufficient).
BTW: Can anybody explain the format of the graphics address remapping table or point me to some docs where it is described?
regards,
Gerhard
