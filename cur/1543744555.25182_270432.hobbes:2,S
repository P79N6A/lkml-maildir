There's a huge difference between an acronyn that is well-established, and 
one that is _totally_ made up, has no history, and is only used on one 
platform.
"irq" is a very traditional shorthand for "interrupt request", and anybody 
who has _ever_ worked with any OS on _any_ platform knows _exactly_ what 
it is.
In contrast, gsi has _zero_ meaning outside some small ACPI group. 
Trust me. Do a poll. 
The same way we don't call disks DASD devices do we not call interrupts 
gsi's.
And that "we" is not a "royal we".  It's a f*cking established _fact_. 
Type "irq" into google, and what's the first hit? In fact, EVERY SINGLE 
hit on the first page is relevant.
In contrast, type "gsi" into google, and NOT A SINGLE ONE has _anything_ 
to do with interrupts. Not the first one, not the tenth one.
So stop being idiotic.
