I don't forsee any order changing.  I would expect to use link
ordering so all the 8250_platform ports are registered first, then
all the 8250_acpi, then all the 8250_pci.
The order WOULD change in some cases on ia64, because we'd get rid
of the current wierdness where the device in the HCDP/PCDP firmware
table always becomes ttyS0, regardless of where it lives.  This
would be an improvement, though, because the devices would stop
changing names just because you selected a different firmware
console.

Yeah, I'll poke him about "console=uart".  I sent it to you because I
think a clean solution requires minor 8250 hooks so we can look up
the ttyS device that corresponds to an MMIO or IO address.
