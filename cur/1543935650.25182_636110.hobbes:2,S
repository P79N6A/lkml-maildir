I must say that the number of bugs which actually go away when the user
stops using nvidia/fglrx/ndiswrapper/etc is a small minority.
And you can usually tell beforehand too: if the user reports bad_page
warnings or pte table scroggage or whatever and they're using nvidia I just
hit 'd'.  But people who think that removing the nvidia driver will
magically fix that khubd-got-stuck-in-D-state bug are urinating up an
incline.
Facts:
- lots of people use nvidia/etc
- most bugs they report aren't caused by nvidia/etc
- we need lots of testers
draw you own conclusions.
