Not sure whether you had had other feedback on this elsewhere in
the rest of the thread, but yes, this would make sense if the
"embedded" angle is the only reason we need this (and not, say,
performance, etc.) Also, having done that, maybe it would make
some sense to have it be a "disable" rather than "enable":
CONFIG_MARKERS_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION?
