Colour me stupid, but I don't see how that can be.
Looking at verify_area() from 2.6.13 - the arm version (
http://sosdg.org/~coywolf/lxr/source/include/asm-arm/uaccess.h?v=2.6.13#L81
) :
static inline int __deprecated verify_area(int type, const void __user
*addr, unsigned long size)
{
        return access_ok(type, addr, size) ? 0 : -EFAULT;
}
How will this cause pre-faulting if a call to access_ok() will not?
Please enlighten me.
