Umm, where did I define "performance" as being
the same as "global disk throughput" ??
You're imagining things again, and blaming me for it ;)

There was a known starvation issue in the elevator,
at least up to 2.4.0-test9-pre2. Until that problem is
resolved, that is the logical thing to "blame" for the
phenomenon that one process stalls while some others are
still running at full speed.
Besides, if it was a VM issue, all allocators would
stall. That did not happen, so VM wasn't the subsystem
to blame in this case.
That said, there may be some interactivity issues with the
VM, but with the elevator bug present, there is not much
possibility to test for those.
About screwing up the VM subsystem, why didn't you help with the
details?  (remember that you agreed about the design in Ottawa)
regards,
Rik
