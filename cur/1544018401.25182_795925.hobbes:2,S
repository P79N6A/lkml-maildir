On x86, spinlocks are now FIFO. But yeah, shouldn't be relying on
architecture-dependent implementation of spinlocks.

Done.
The unlock and lock could be removed and only compiled in if PREEMPT.
If the number of tasks isn't bound, the lock might be held too long.
It would be kinda funny if hung_task caused a softlockup.
---
To avoid holding the tasklist lock too long, hung_task_check_count was used
as an upper bound on the number of tasks that are checked by hung_task.
This patch removes the hung_task_check_count sysctl.
Instead of checking a limited number of tasks, all tasks are checked. To
avoid holding the tasklist lock too long, the lock is released periodically
and the processor rescheduled if necessary.
The design was proposed by Frédéric Weisbecker.
