It seems kind of odd, at first, but it does make sense in a inverted sort
of way.  Basically you aren't going to get any signals from the kernel
until the EWOULDBLOCK state clears.  Consider what would happen if you
received a signal every time you could, say send. Your process would be
flooded with signals, which of course wouldn't work.  If you want to take
a look at the Hybrid-7 cvs tree, let me know and I can give you a copy of
it.  I just got the sigio stuff working correctly in their.
