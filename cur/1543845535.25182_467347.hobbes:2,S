No.  It is being used.
This interface is used to register board-specific functions that can be
use to control the serial port modem-control lines.
For example, the AT91RM9200 only provides the full modem-control signals
on USART1.  If you need the modem-control signals for any of the other
ports you need to drive some of the GPIO pins manually.  So you need
this hook back into your board-specific file to do that.
