Two reasons:
  1) "...of which Parted is just one."  Whatever logic you fancy for
     determining the geometry, the results need to be available to
     several tools.  Parted is only one such tool; ergo, the logic
     belongs OUTSIDE of it.  Parted should expect to be TOLD the
     geometry in any situation where it matters.
  2) The ideal logic varies depending on the capabilities of your
     kernel.  The distribution vendor knows the capabilities of its
     kernel, and can construct appropriate logic.  Putting logic into
     Parted to handle every possible kernel is a sloppy design.
I hate "smart" software.  Don't be smart; be simple.  Default to
whatever you like, but give me a way to TELL Parted the geometry.

You understood correctly, but see below...

Not according to the kernel developers.  They are threatening to
remove HDIO_GETGEO completely.

No, because Parted will "helpfully" infer the geometry from the
existing partition table, no matter what HDIO_GETGEO returns!
In short, the /proc/ide/hdX/settings + HDIO_GETGEO solution 1) only
works on blank drives and 2) uses an interface which the kernel
developers consider a crock.

Yes, absolutely.  This is why I wrote the legacy_* support for the
edd.o module in the first place.  Otherwise, I could have used
x/255/63 and been done with it.
