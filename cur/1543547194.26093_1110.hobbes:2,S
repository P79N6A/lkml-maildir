Jan,
Motherboards that have integrated Promise Ultra/100 controller use
the 20265 chipset. The standard Promise Ultra/100 PCI card uses the
20267 chipset. However, both chipsets are supported in Andre patch
dated 08/05 or later. The latest patch is dated on 08/25. You can
download it at the following site:
