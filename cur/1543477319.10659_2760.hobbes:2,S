I have been following the kernel-C++ discussion as it spins off
the cliff, hoping to see an answer to the one question that matters.
We don't need a flame war here about the relative merits of C and C++.  
(I have been more disappointed to read miserable FUD written by people 
whom I respect (you know who you are) than to read flaming advocacy 
by people I never heard of (and you know who you are, too).)
The only question that matters is this:
  Will Linus accept header-file patches in 2.3 to clean up 
  incompatibilities with Egcs g++?  
If not, then there is nothing to discuss.  
If so, then there is _still_ nothing to discuss until somebody 
writes an interesting driver in C++ and demonstrates some merits 
in using the language in the context of the Linux kernel.
What seems dead clear, either way, is that talking about using C++ 
exceptions in the Linux kernel is purely masturbatory.  It simply 
won't happen in any foreseeable future.  C++ has plenty of other 
strengths ("OO" features perhaps least among them, for kernel 
purposes), but there is no point in talking about them either 
without code in hand.
