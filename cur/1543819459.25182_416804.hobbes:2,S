I haven't really understood what problem this solves.  Is this just a
standardised form of documentation, or are you imagining that an automatic
tool will use this to auto include a minimal set of firmware files in an
initrd?  I'm thinking of something like this: (1) redhat (or whoever) ships
firmware files for every driver under the sun in /lib/firmware; (2) redhat
wants to allow users to have a customized initrd with only essential drivers;
(3) the tool goes through the list of essential drivers, looks up the firmware
string via MODULE_FIRMWARE, finds the file in /lib/firmware, and includes it
in the initrd.
All the best,
Duncan.
