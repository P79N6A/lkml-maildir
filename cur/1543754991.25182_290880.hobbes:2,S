Here's the description from Apple.
(from
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Darwin/Conceptual/KernelProgramming/scheduler/chapter_8_section_4.html
):
However, according Stéphane Letz who ported JACK to OSX, this does NOT
describe the reality of the current implementation - it's not a real
deadline scheduler.  "period" and "constraint" are ignored, RT tasks are
scheduled round robin, and the scheduler just uses "computation" as the
timeslice.  If an RT task repeatedly uses its entire timeslice without
blocking, the scheduler can demote the task to SCHED_NORMAL.
Audio apps do not normally set these parameters directly, the CoreAudio
backend handles it.

(This was from a private mail thread, that lead to Con's SCHED_ISO patches, 
if all the participants agree I will post a link to the full thread because 
it answers many questions that are sure to come up on LKML)
So this system *requires* an app to tell the kernel in advance what its
RT constraints are, then revokes isochronous scheduling privileges if
the task lied.  This would require a new API.  Furthermore I suspect
that these "System" threads aren't subject to having their RT privileges
revoked, and that the GUI gets special treatment, etc.
The upshot is while the OSX system works in that environment, it's
largely due to Apple controlling the kernel and a lot of userspace.  OSX
is useful as a model of what a good API for soft realtime support in a
desktop OS would look like.  But we are a general purpose OS so we
certainly need a more general solution.
