Subject: [PATCH] make (vim) tags
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's my version of a kernel tags generator to be used with vim.
One interesting part is limiting the set of searched files to just some
architectures, and culling out drivers you'll never want to look at.
The other interesting bit is telling ctags to ignore certain
identifiers so it doesn't generate 50 entries for __initdata, e.g.
New file, presented as a diff.
