On powerpc we manage to keep gettimeofday monotonic even when ntpd is
adjusting the clock.  We have 3 parameters used to convert a value
from the timebase register to the time of day, and these parameters
are adjusted if necessary at the beginning of each tick, based on the
value returned by current_tick_length().  The point is that
current_tick_length() tells you at the *beginning* of each tick how
much time will be added on to xtime at the *end* of that tick, and
that makes it possible to aim the interpolation to hit the same value
as xtime at the end of each tick.
Clearly if you make a discrete jump backwards with settimeofday or
adjtime, it's impossible to keep gettimeofday monotonic, but apart
from that it's monotonic on powerpc.
At least, that's the way it's supposed to work.  I hope the recent
timekeeping changes haven't broken it. :)
Paul.
