No it doesn't.
We have the page locked.
And if somebody does "getpage()" and doesn't check for the page lock, then
that test _still_ doesn't prevent races, because the getpage might happen
just _after_ the "atomic_read()".
As it stands now, that atomic_read() does _nothing_. If you think
something depends on it, then that something is already buggy.
