This is the revised patch for fixing the following problems of a
memory copy function in nilfs2 ioctl.
(1) It tries to allocate 128KB size of memory even for small objects.
(2) Though the function repeatedly tries large memory allocations
    while reducing the size, GFP_NOWAIT flag is not specified.
    This increases the possibility of system memory shortage.
(3) During the retries of (2), verbose warnings are printed
    because _GFP_NOWARN flag is not used for the kmalloc calls.
The first patch was still doing large allocations by kmalloc which are
repeatedly tried while reducing the size.
Andi Kleen has pointed out that just using vmalloc would be
easy/faster/more reliable, and he also told me that using
copy_from_user for large memory is not good from the viewpoint of
preempt latency:

For the function in question, the size of buffer memory can be reduced
since the buffer is repeatedly used for a number of small objects.  On
the other hand, it may incur large preempt latencies for larger buffer
because a copy_from_user (and a copy_to_user) was applied only once
each cycle.
So, this revision avoids the latency issue as well as fixes the
original problems merely by reducing allocation size of the buffer.
