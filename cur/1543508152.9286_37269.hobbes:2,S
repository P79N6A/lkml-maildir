Since bounce_user_kiobuf() is required anyway, I would prefer this
aproach:
it looks like a 2 line fix.

Is that planed for 2.[34]?
If not, then I'd wait: I don't like a large in-advance solution for a
not exactly defined problem [possible OOM problems]
Note that currently, kswapd automagically ignores pages from bigmem if
it cannot allocate the bounce buffer [mm/vmscan.c, line 159]. It will be
difficult to do that in ll_rw_block().
