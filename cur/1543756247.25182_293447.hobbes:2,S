Sorry guys! I have been away for three weeks on short term disability.:(
I have tested Christoph's patch before the leave. It did work for CSA
and showed performance improvement on certain configuration.
CSA is currently implemented as a loadable module. I think ELSA is the
same, right? The use of the enhanced accounting data collection
code is not in the kernel tree. That was why Andrew did not see usage of 
the accounting patches. Should i propose to include the CSA module in
the kernel then, Andrew? :)
Cheers,
