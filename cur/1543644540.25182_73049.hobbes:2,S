Bloat, bloat, and more bloat.  This API is not scalable at all, if we 
have to add a new header and new foo_problem() macros for every little 
subsystem in the kernel.
If you actually want to standardize some diagnostic messages, it is a 
huge mistake [as your scsi driver example shows] to continue to use 
random text strings followed by a typed attribute list.  If you really 
wanted to standardize logging, why continue to allow driver authors to 
printk driver-specific text strings in lieu of a standard string that 
applies to the same situation in N drivers.
I do encourage the clean-up of drivers logging and can see the utility 
of it, but you are really using a sledgehammer to drive in a carpet nail 
here...
