I ran into the same problem some time ago on e1000. The problem was
that if the link doesn't come up netconsole ends up waiting forever
for it.
The patch was for 2.6.12, did a quick untested port to 2.6.13rc5.

Only try a limited number to send packets in netpoll
Avoids hangs on e1000 when link is not up.
