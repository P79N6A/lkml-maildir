There was a lengthy discussion some weeks ago about exactly this.
Sveasoft has expressed that they think they're in the clear
because they're shipping the sourcecode to older versions of
their distribution and their current version is nothing more
than their old distribution plus some additional proprietary
code.
I still believe that this is both incorrect and also impolite
but we'll only know for sure if someone tries to enforce the GPL
in this case.
Servus,
