The Xircom ISDN interface looks like a serial modem with special AT
commands.  There is no need for special kernel code to support it.
Alas you need to know what AT commands to send to the Xircom.  Ask
Xircom for their ISDN AT command set and use a chat script.  It is a
userspace problem, not kernel.
