   Not true. Even if the only descriptors available are 64-bit, there is no 
   reason why I should have to care about the upper 32 bits when I know that 
   my dma_addr_t will always be 32-bit, at compile time. I can simply 
   memset(0) the entire descriptor and initialize only the bottom 32 bits. 
Yes true, storing the two consequetive 32-bit values is better
for store buffer compression of the cpu.  Using memset is much
more inefficient because you push the full set of data once
then you push non-compressible stores to the same data through
the cpu.
I'm not talking out of my ass, I've measured this.
