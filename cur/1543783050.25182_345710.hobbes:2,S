logging in...this is really a userspace notion, so via PAM.  creating a
new process or changing credentials of a new process are the types of
things that lsm watches (and of course, opening of files).

I don't think that can be done in a race free manner.  Perhaps get the
device and check its state, but you'd have to ask usb folks.  ATM, it's
only checked during exec of root process.
