You might want to double check that your most recently built kernel isn't
on a disk cylinder higher than 1024, as I'm booting off of my second IDE
interface, first drive, just fine. I'm figuring that you've had 2.3.16
around for a while and it lays on your disk below 1024; the other two
kernels were built later, and subsequently installed somewhere above that
dreaded limit.
(Could be a good time to make /boot a separate partition!)
Let me know if that's not the case.
