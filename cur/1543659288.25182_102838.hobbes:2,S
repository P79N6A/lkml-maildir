I'd just ask whether you considered what happens when:
1. two people open the same tty
2. the tty is hung up
3. both people close the tty
(this isn't an indication that the patch is wrong, I'm just interested
to know.)
I'll test its behaviour later today - the current rules for incrementing/
decrementing the tty driver module use counts are rediculous at present,
and this patch would solve it nicely.
