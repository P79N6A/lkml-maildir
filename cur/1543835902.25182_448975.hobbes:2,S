Yes, it is possible.
I would ask is it needed at all? It contains number of immediately fired
events (i.e. those which were ready when event was added and thus
syscall returned immediately showing that it is ready), total number of
events, which were inserted in the given queue and number of events
which were marked as ready after they were inserted.
Currently it is compilation option which ends up in printk with above
info when kevent queue is removed.
