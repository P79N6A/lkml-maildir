Since I've gotten so much entertainment value out of this "conversation" as
a lurker, I feel compelled to give back to the greater community.

All your examples show is that inheritance in C++ is usually implemented
with a pointer to a vtable, and that the compiler isn't quite smart enough
to figure out that you only have 1 virtual function in your class and that
it could replace the vtable ptr with the contents of the vtable ptr.
To turn your example on it's head, add another "virtual" function to your C
and C++ code.  Now count the number of cycles required to copy or
initialize objects in a loop.  Uh oh, looks like C is hopelessly broken, it
requires an INEVITABLE extra memory reference.  
ROTFL.
