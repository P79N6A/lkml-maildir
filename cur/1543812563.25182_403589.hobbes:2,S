Honestly I'm quite surprised that there is a difference between legacy 
and native mode (more joy :)).  ICH seems to want an ack to the bmdma 
status register even on non-DMA commands, since it directly reflects the 
IDE INTRQ line.  Perhaps pounding on the Status register will clear that 
condition, thus enabling legacy software to continue successfully 
without worry about this ICH-specific detail.  </speculation>
