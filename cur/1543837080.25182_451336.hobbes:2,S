Subject: 2.6.17.8 - do_vfs_lock: VFS is out of sync with lock manager!

I have some webservers that have recently started reporting the
following message in their logs :
  do_vfs_lock: VFS is out of sync with lock manager!
The serveres kernels were upgraded to 2.6.17.8 and since the upgrade
the message started appearing.
The servers were previously running 2.6.13.4 without experiencing this problem.
Nothing has changed except the kernel.
I've googled a bit and found this mail
(
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/23/254
) from Trond saying that
"The above is a lockd error that states that the VFS is failing to track
your NFS locks correctly".
Ok, but that doesn't really help me resolve the issue. The servers are
indeed running NFS and access their apache DocumentRoots from a NFS
mount.
Is there anything I can do to help track down this issue?
