 There is still a little difference between your implement in
 inotify_dentry_parent_queue_event from dnotify_parent
 In dnotify_parent, if parent is not watching the event, the code will
not fall
 through dget and dput path.
 While in inotify_dentry_parent_queue_event kernel will go dget and dput
even
 if (inode->inotify_data == NULL).
 
 While dget and dput will introduce a lot of atomic operations..
 And the most important, dput will grab global dcache_lock...,
 I think that is the reason why John Hawkes saw great performance drop.
 
 Simply follow dnotify_parent, only call dget and dput when
inode->inotify_data != NULL will solve this problem I think.
