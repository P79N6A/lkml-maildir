I tried something useful with this, see below.

It probably means that the very clear explanations you shortened above 
should go it a file in Documentation. Particularly with the feature to 
have different levels of message different colors this allows monitoring 
of machines even when you can't read the message from a distance. When 
you see the magic color you can go look closer.

I tried something here, I have a monitor page on my window manager with 
lots of xterms opened to machines like DNS, HTTP, mail and NNTP servers. 
I use 100x25 xterms, with font size default. So just for fun I put a one 
line message on one in green on black (instead of black on white) and 
sized them all down to "unreadable" (cntl-right click menu) and I could 
clearly tell which one had the message even on the postage stamps.
Then I tried white on red, white on blue, and white on green. Those 
messages made the tiny xterm stand out as well. So I think it's a true 
statement that using colors to make important stuff stand out is 
something which in practice would be useful. Obviously if you use the 
"unreadable" font you can't read it, but that one xterm can be resized 
to a sane font to actually use it.
This isn't any dumber that Fedora printing the boot status of anything 
which fails in red, that may be "damned by faint praise" of course.
