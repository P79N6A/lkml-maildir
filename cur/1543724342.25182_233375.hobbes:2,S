For our benefit, could you try to recreate the situation with
the cfq scheduler, and see if it still skips? If not, also do
a run with the anticpatory scheduler again to see if your
recreation was enough to cause a skip there...
That would at least point to the culprit (disk or cpu starvation)
Thanks
