Subject: [PATCH] x86: Document the hotplug code is incompatible with x86 irq handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I just realized that except for doing the code review and noticing
that the current cpu hotplug code is fundamentally incompatible
with x86 I haven't done anything about it.  So here is my patch
to document what is wrong.
The current cpu hotplug code requires irqs to be migrated from a cpu
outside of irq context.  On x86 ioapics simply do not support this,
making the code unfixable without major redesign of the generic cpu
hotplug code.
So this patch makes CPU_HOTPLUG on x86 depend on CONFIG_BROKEN
and adds a WARN_ON so people that do enable it are not in doubt about
which part of the code is broken, even if it does work for them.
