Is there any reason to not just remove the lines
        if (!onlist)
                /* The page is still mapped, so it can't be freeable... */
                age_page_down_ageonly(page);
        /*
         * If the page is in active use by us, or if the page
         * is in active use by others, don't unmap it or
         * (worse) start unneeded IO.
         */
        if (page->age > 0)
                goto out_failed;
from vmscan?
They look like a complete hack, although an understandable one from the
time when the virtual memory scan used to actually do IO as well.
These days, if you think of the VM scanning as just a "shrink the page
tables" operation, the down-aging doesn't make much sense. That will
happen once the page has been moved to the lists, no?
