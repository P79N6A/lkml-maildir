Hello,
I have a problem to poweroff my machine when issuing halt -p.
I turned on APM in the kernel as well as in the BIOS, but all I get to see are
myriads of hex numbers in square brackets after the "System halted."/"Power
down" message.
The setup is the following:
- Gigabyte GA6BX-E Mainboard with the latest BIOS (according to Gigabyte's
  website)
- Intel Pentium II-350
- 128 MB RAM
running
- Kernel 2.2.2 (Problem occurred since I had the machine, which is since
  beginning of thgey year --> since 2.1.1[23]x)
- both using conventional VGA text mode as well as fbcon
- RedHat 5.2 (with necessary updates installed (I think))
Nils
