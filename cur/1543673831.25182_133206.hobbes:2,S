Hopefully near future only, assuming you have a proper log/alert system
that sends logs to another machine.
(and if you don't and your box stays owned, you have bigger problems
than the swap sniffing).

The performance impact for one.  My systems often has processes taking
hundreds of megabytes in swap.  If we'd have to wipe all this space on the
disk whenever such process dies, the system would be unusable.
Second, see previous posts on this thread re hardware issues when writing
zero blocks to some disks.  In short, you're never sure its really clean.
Third, in case of crash (i.e. when someone pulls the plug and steals the
server), the system had no chance to clean the swap.
Encrypted swap solves all that.
