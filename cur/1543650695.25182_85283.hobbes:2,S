An excellent engineering practice but extremely difficult to do.  This is
the holy-grail of software design and I don't think it would work for an
extremely loosely connected set of developers.
There is no central control of the system (or chain of accountability) and
that knocks down the practicality of this plan.  It would work extremely
well in another project, though.
} What does the list think of this?
