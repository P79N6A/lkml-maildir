It won't give more accurate backtraces, not even on i386 because show_stack
doesn't have any code to follow frame pointers.

I have a plan to fix this - basically Jan's NLKD has
code to read the unwind information and then do an accurate backtrace
without frame pointers. The plan is to port that code over
(it currently requires too much infrastructure from the debugger
and needs some coding style fixes) and then add something like
CONFIG_RUNTIME_UNWIND_INFO that puts the unwind information into
the running kernel. Then you'll get accurate backtraces without 
frame pointers.
The NLKD code would work on i386 too so it could be later enabled
there then too.
IA64 works similar already BTW but the code is not really usable
for other architectures.

They are useless because the core kernel doesn't have any code
to follow them. That's true on i386 and on x86-64.
The only reason to use them would be external debuggers, but those
don't need them on x86-64 neither.
