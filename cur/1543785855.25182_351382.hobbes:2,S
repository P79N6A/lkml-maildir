Basically, the concerns raised are non-issues.	The new patch
merely limits the BAR restoration to those situations where it is
truly needed.  Anything broken in that situation was broken before
the original patch as well.
The only other point was that this particular ia64 hardware is
broken if you can't rewrite its BARs.  That may well be, but we can
accomodate it w/o losing the intent of the original patch.
Tony's post indicates that this is not a generic ia64 problem.  If you
want a patch along the lines of what Dave Miller and Ivan Kokshaysky
advocate (i.e. something in the pci access routines for this box),
then Keith or someone else w/ knowledge of (and access to) this box
will need to step forward w/ a patch or at least some information.
