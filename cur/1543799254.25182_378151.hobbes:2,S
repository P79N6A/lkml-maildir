I am afraid, I'd better not:
 - spin-locks do not imply disabled interrupts;
 - how can "swapper" guarantee that there is enough pages in the free
 list to satisfy stack page faults atomically? The only way is to keep
 free page for each thread. But then it's so much easier to just use
 this reserved page for the stack from the very beginning. 
 Note, that RSX/RT didn't have "kernel threads" at all: it was
 implemented as a non-blocking state machine serving user requests on
 per-cpu stacks (at least pdp-15 versions).
