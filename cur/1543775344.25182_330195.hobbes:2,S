That explains a lot. Thanks for clarification : )

The initramfs contains /init which is a shell script, while /bin/sh is 
bash. So I figure bash is running with PID 1, but I'll verify that by 
adding echo $$ to the init script.

I'm not (yet) too much into C programming, so I'm afraid I won't be able 
to do that. As this problem arises only due to my own early-userspace 
setup, I'd rather try using different shells for init-as-shell-script, 
and maybe do some not-so-clean hacks to get the bigger picture.
As this is not a kernel issue, I'd rather take this one off LKML and 
write a success report once appropriate.
Thanks for your help to everyone involved : )
