The fix only for smp_call_function seems fine to me since we really don't 
want to broadcast to all processors but only online ones. 
smp_call_function is particularly dangerous because the interrupt handler 
accesses stack data which wouldn't be persistent due to the calling 
processor not waiting for non online processors.
