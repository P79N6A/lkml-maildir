Hi,
I would like to bring your attention to 2nd oops posted in the first mail for
this thread (
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0202.1/1193.html
).
Initially I thought both might be same because they were both releated bind
hash lists. But I have to began suspect it. The first oops is because of race
caused by tw structures left out in the list.. for which a patch is being
discussed here. 
The second one seems to be purely because of a corrupted tb
(tcp_bind_hashbucket).. there is no race there.. tb just got pointers into
arbitary place. Also we saw second oops sometimes with relatively less load.
These are two locations it we have seen (with different bad values for
affending pointers each time it occured):
net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c:tcp_v4_get_port(): 
                        spin_lock(&head->lock);
                        for (tb = head->chain; tb; tb = tb->next)
1======>                         if (tb->port == rover)
/*tb is a bad pointer, not NULL */        goto next;
                        break;
                next:
                        spin_unlock(&head->lock);
	            /*
			 more stuff removed
                    */
                         struct sock *sk2 = tb->owners; 
                         int sk_reuse = sk->reuse; 
                         for( ; sk2 != NULL; sk2 = sk2->bind_next) { 
                              if (sk != sk2 && 
2======>                           sk->bound_dev_if == sk2->bound_dev_if) { 
/* sk2 (tb->owners) is a bad pointer */
I will think more about if the problem that causes 1st oops can cause this as
well.
Thanks,
Raghu.
