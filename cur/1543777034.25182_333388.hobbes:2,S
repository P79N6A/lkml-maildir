Hi,

I was not quite able to reproduce these values, probably because I got the
math wrong. I used:
  $oneSecond = $ticksJiffie * $HZ / 1193182
which yields 11932*100/1193182 = 1.00001508571198693912, !=1.000015238
Math corrections welcome.
Anyway, I've done some graphs. Intersting that the smaller the HZ, the less
error (seen on a whole, esp. view_1k and view_8k.png) we get. 20Hz seems to
be the 0.0 case, and 18Hz is not bad either. IIRC, DOS used 18HZ ;)
