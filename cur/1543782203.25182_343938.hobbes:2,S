Hi!
I have also the problem with a dlt drive HP C9264CB (with
media changer). After I have discovered, that after a
rmmod st ; modprobe st
the tape is working again, I take same "readings" in the
code of st.c.
I think, I have detect a bug. The st_buf_fragment[] should
begin after the scatterlist[]

I have it not tested, because the tape drive is in a datacenter
of a provider, and "killing" the kernel will not be repairable
with an ssh-connect ;-(  I can't get the tape out off the data-
center before friday..
