The gratuitous inconsistencies between platforms is something that is 
currently driving me up the wall.  I'm starting to think the NetBSD 
people have the right idea: when you add a system call on NetBSD, you 
only have to add it in one place and it becomes available on all the 
platforms they support.  Of course, you can provide a custom 
implementation for any one platform, but the idea is to keep as much of 
the code generic as possible...
