You misread what I wrote.  This is a rephrasing of what I wrote:
The splitting does not affect any shells when called by scripts with
<= 1 argument - because the splitting change doesn't affect anything
in those cases.
Therefore the shell behaviour is not relevant, except for such scripts.
On my system there are no such scripts.
