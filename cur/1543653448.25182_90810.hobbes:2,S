Hi,
I just read this RFC on 'local link configuration' (mirrored at
http://keetweej.vanheusden.com/~folkert/draft-ietf-zeroconf-ipv4-linklocal.t
xt ) and I was wondering: is this planned to be in the kernel? Or should
occur this in userspace? (and if so; does it exist? freshmeat/google say it
doesn't)
Initially I thought I just configure an ip-address in that range on an
adapter, but then I read that there is this whole protocol of sending and
receiving arp-requests etc.
