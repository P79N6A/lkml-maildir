Dear Trond,
Thanks for answering my question, we have use the i386 kernel at the
server that works fine. Also even we uses the i686 kerenl at the server,
it happens normally when doing NFS mounts, it will only be dead slow
when
	server i686 2.4.7-10 kernel && client nfsroot(2.4.13 i686)
The network is fine. It is so slow that an ls -l at the rootfs takes
more than 2 minutes. The readdir() seems alright because the ls
immediate counts the number of records says "total blahbalh" but when
doing individual lookup calls, it seems slow like hell. We have other
production i686smp servers 2.4.14 serving diskless i686 clients using
2.4.13 kernels works great. Is there any difference in nfsroot with
normal nfsmounts? And can we configure the nfsroot use a v3 mount?
becaus now it defaults to v2 always.
David
