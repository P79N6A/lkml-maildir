Hi David,
I think this really depends on what you are trying to debug. If you
expect the macros to do exactly what they are described to be doing
then I'd agree. However every so often when you look up the macros you
really want to look at the details what they are actually doing or
even compare them to another arch's implementation to make sure they
are behaving the same. At least thats my experience.
I personally think it's unrealistic to think one can try and debug
things in include/asm without being able to read the assembly output
in the first place.

Reducing the amount of inline asm in the kernel would be a good
thing. It is cetainly one of those things that have been abused way
beyond it's intent.
Cheers,
Jes
