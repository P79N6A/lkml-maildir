From reading the kernel source, it would appear that all and only Pentiums
are assumed to have the f00f bug.  From the source of 2.2.6-ac1
include/asm-i386/bugs.h:
__initfunc(static void check_pentium_f00f(void))
{
        /*
         * Pentium and Pentium MMX
         */
        boot_cpu_data.f00f_bug = 0;
        if (boot_cpu_data.x86 == 5 && boot_cpu_data.x86_vendor ==
			X86_VENDOR_INTEL) {
                printk(KERN_INFO "Intel Pentium with F0 0F bug - workaround"
				"enabled.\n");
                boot_cpu_data.f00f_bug = 1;
                trap_init_f00f_bug();
        }
}
