Just _what_ information do you want to get from there? That some packet
has a reference to file? Great. Gonna love this DoS - you'll have to lock
the whole thing to do that and it will not be a fast operation. OK, you
did it. So? Yes, we know that somebody holds such a reference. Fine. Who?
The destination may change. Easily. Moreover, if several processes hold
have the receiveing socket opened _any_ of them may get the packet. Better
yet, there may be no one having such a thing - socket itself may be passed
the same way. Want to trace _all_ pathes? 'cause many pointers can be
passed that way... You are not even promised that there will be no loops.
Good luck dealing with that.
