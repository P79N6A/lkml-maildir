Because it may only operate on a small section of the file and hopefully 
splice the rest through? But yes support for mmapped I/O would be 
necessary.

There was no talk about slightly. 1G page size would actually be quite 
convenient for some applications.

Writing a terabyte of memory to disk with handling 256 billion page 
structs? In case of a system with 1 petabyte of memory this may be rather 
typical and necessary for the application to be able to save its state
on disk.

No, we need support for larger page sizes than 16k. 16k has not been fine 
for a couple of years. We only agreed to 16k because that was the common 
consensus. Best performance was always at 64k 4 years ago (but then we 
have no numbers for higher page sizes yet). Now we would prefer much 
larger sizes.
