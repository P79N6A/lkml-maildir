I wrote a patch some time ago to correct a bug exactly at usblp_write. It is 
still not in the main kernel, but you can give it a try and see if it helps. It 
applies cleanly against 2.6.2-rc2, but I guess it should apply to 2.6.2-rc3.
This patch corrected a problem for me, that happened when a printer presents an 
out-of-paper status while printing a document. The driver would send endless 
garbage to the printer.
I hope this helps,
