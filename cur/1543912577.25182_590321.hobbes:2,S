When I have an iPod attached via USB to an ABIT IC7-G board before it 
boots up and let X start etc, the mouse (PS/2) does not function, but the 
keyboard works OK.
GPM does not work either.
When I attach the iPod after the machine has booted up, everything is OK, 
until the next reboot (with the iPod still attached via USB)
Any idea why this happens?
The kernel .config is attached.
There are no modules in use, everything is compiled into the kernel, the 
distribution is Debian Testing.
