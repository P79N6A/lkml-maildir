I see it as a big advantage to not have to use the main kernel for the 
suspend. please keep it as an option at least.

I thought the existing hibernation wrote to the swap partition as it's 
dedicated space?
I didn't know that anyone was suggesting writing the hibernation image to 
a filesystem that the kernel was activly accessing.

I was talking about the scripts that would be used inside the initrd (or 
boot partition of whatever type)
to start with don't worry about how the kexec kernel gets it's / 
filesystem (for testing just use a real partition on your disk. after you 
get everything working let the people who really understand the initrd and 
consider it trivial switch it to an initrd image)
fo rthe current stage where we are trying to make things work don't worry 
about packaging everything tight with initrd and re-useing partitions or 
kernel images. once everything is working reliably then it's time to look 
at useing the same kernel for multiple functions, writing to a partition 
that's i use for other things, etc
unless you are saying that this is a trivial task, and if someone is 
willing to use seperate partitions and kernels this works well, and 
therefor the only problem left is how to make it look the same to the user 
as the old approach?

later on it may be the right thing, for now get it working with different 
images.
