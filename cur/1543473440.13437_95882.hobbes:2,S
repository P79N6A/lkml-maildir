I think I understand why you say this, but the collection of fixes Alan
has rolled into 2.1.132-ac3 make the difference between a knfsd that works
and one that doesn't.

Marking it experimental is a good idea.  No arguments.  I suspect the
reason that no one has come forth to support the kernel-based server is
that it touches a large number of specialized subsystems.  Most of us
mortals are just barely catching up with the myriad of low-level changes
between 2.0 and 2.2 <g>.  It would seem to require a superhuman hacker,
perhaps an Alan Cox / Bill Hawes hybrid?  
Though I have dug out and fixed two minor problems in the past year,
the majority of the kernel nfs code is beyond my meager abilities.
