Oh it's not such a big problem then. If it tells you/Andre anything,
the controller I've run into trouble with seems to be (output from
2.4.19-pre2):
00:0f.1 IDE interface: Relience Computer: Unknown device 0211 (prog-if 8a [Master SecP PriP])
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64

ServerWorks OSB4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 79
ServerWorks OSB4: chipset revision 0
(This is what they put into the HP NetServer E800, which is otherwise a nice
machine -- With these we can get up to 8 NICs to work w/o IRQ sharing. Ideal
for building routers, except if we were to put SCSI drives everywhere, we'd
have nothing to eat soon enough.)
So far we've been ok as 2.4.19-pre2 indeed appears to work just fine in UDMA2.
