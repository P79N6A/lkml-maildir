Hi there !
I'm also having some problems with this combination.
First, at boot time there's a message, that should belong to pppd:
SIOCADDRT: Invalid argument
Couldn't find how to get rid of it.
My ppp connection sometimes hangs and there are strange
messages in the log file I've never seen before.
Looks like a hex dump.
I've attached the ppp.log and syslog of one connection.
I had a closer look at older syslogs (kernel 2.2pre6).
There was another message from the kernel that might help:
kernel: TCPv4 bad checksum from 195.27.221.8:0050 
   to 130.149.145.83:0435, len=912/912/932
I've attached this part of the log as well.
I have 2xSCSI and 1xIDE harddiscs. The IDE is running in
PIO mode and is not in use most of the time as the whole
system is on the SCSI harddiscs. Actually, it's nearly
always powered off.
I'm not on that list, so Cc would be nice.
Steffen
