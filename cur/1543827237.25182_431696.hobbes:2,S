Here are real numbers, which illustrate how the above two statements 
contradict, and how the second statement is false:
blkdev A, formatted with a 50MB filesystem
	block size		4096
	block count		12800 (size S1)
	inodes per group	12800
blkdev A, formatted to full capacity (~350GB)
	block size		4096
	block count		95472256 (size S2)
	inodes per group	32768
Case 1:	online resize from 50MB to 350GB
Result:	inodes per group == 12800 (it remains the same)
Case 2: mke2fs blkdev A, with no block-count restrictions
Result:	inodes per group == 32768
Thus, each inode group holds fewer inodes per group in case #1 than #2.
Thus, case #2 has greater inode density than case #1.
Overall,
a) mke2fs chooses optimal values based on creation-time block count
b) online resize does not change these values
thus the values are no longer optimal.  And in this case, they are never 
-more- optimal, and potentially -less- optimal.
