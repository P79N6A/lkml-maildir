Patch makes no difference.
Situation:
 no special kernel boot parameters concerning these disks,
 no hdparm used
 no CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366
For 2.5.33:
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 48
HPT366: detected chipset, but driver not compiled in!
HPT366: chipset revision 1
HPT366: not 100%% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0x9c00-0x9c07, BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf:pio
HPT366: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 49
HPT366: chipset revision 1
HPT366: not 100%% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xa800-0xa807, BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
For 2.5.38:
The string HPT does not occur in the boot log.
For 2.5.38 with CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366:
 all OK at first sight, the disks mount, have not tried to stress them
 warnings in boot.log:
HPT366: chipset revision 1
HPT366: not 100%% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0x9c00-0x9c07, BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:DMA
hde: Maxtor 93652U8, ATA DISK drive
hdf: Maxtor 96147H6, ATA DISK drive
hde: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hde: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
hdf: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdf: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
Funny that 2.5.33 reports "BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf:pio"
while 2.5.38 says "BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:DMA".
Long ago I would get (sporadic) disk errors and fs corruption with
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366, while all worked without. Today
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_HPT366 is required, but apart from the messages quoted
I have not seen any error messages or problems. Everything works.
Precisely the same holds for 2.5.39.
