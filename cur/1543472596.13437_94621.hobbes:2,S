Wasn't there a compression patent held by IBM for which an earlier
patent on exactly the same algorithm already exists?

Actually it wasn't Microsoft but a tiny video graphics equipment
manufacturer from the 70s, the patent was later acquired by HP. The
essence of the patent, however, was hardware split-screen and panning,
in a way every VGA can do (and the Atari 400/800 display list
processor already could). They claimed IBM and other big players paid
royalties.
