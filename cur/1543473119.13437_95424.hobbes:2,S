   Actually, it wasn't me -- I have just moved the old code to oldproc.c
and didn't touch its format at all except for formatting of 64-bit
addresses. I did some investigation to figure out where did this change
appear and it turned out that the format was changed by DaveM when he wanted
UltraSparc 32-bit IRQ numbers to be shown in a reasonable way. As /proc/pci
is only a backward-compatibility option now, we can safely switch
back to decimal IRQ numbering. That's all. Sending a patch to Linus :-)
				Have a nice fortnight
