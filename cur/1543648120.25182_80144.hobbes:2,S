The spec hasn't ratified yet and I don't have a copy (I only have 
pre-spec hardware).  I think distribution is limited to PICMG members 
once a spec is available, but I'm not sure.  Who needs specs anyway :)

If you think it would be accepted, I'd spend the time making 2.5 kernel 
patches.  Beyond your other comments, any suggestions to get it accepted?

The hotplug events occur through IPMI (a system management interface 
specification) messages.  I'm not sure if the hotswap manager will go in 
the kernel or not, but if it were in the kernel, it could use 
/sbin/hotplug to notify management software of hotswap events (which 
would allow the scsi hotswap commands to be used to add or remove 
devices).  Initially I am going to probably do a user space manager 
since its simpler and I think that sort of thing probably belongs in 
user space.  It will access the IPMI driver, read hotswap events from 
the IPMI driver, and swap in and out devices and map/unmap devices via 
the ga mapper.
Perhaps what is really needed is a kernel driver that uses the IPMI 
driver kernel interface to pump disk device hotswap messages through 
/sbin/hotplug.  After I get a userspace implementation working (which is 
easier to debug and test) I can start work on something like this.  What 
would you think of that?  The nice thing about using /sbin/hotplug is 
more things can be scripted like automatically removing a MD disk if the 
hotswapped device is part of an MD device.
I've not started on this component yet and am just figuring out the IPMI 
messaging at this point.  Any comments you have on how to best integrate 
this into the current hotplug system would be highly welcomed.

I'll have to look at that.  I'm not familiar with the ram based 
filesystem.  Could you point me to a source file that uses some of the 
interfaces?
