Hi there,
in the past, I reported about my multithreaded benchmark being faster with
HZ=400 than with HZ=100 on ix86.
From that, a defficiency in the linux SMP scheduling algorithm could be
guessed.
I created a HZ=400 patch (configurable) for ix86, which can be found
on my web page 
http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/
 
The benchmark is on 
http://pebbles.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de/numlib/
Now, with the scheduler changes in 2.2.8, my benchmark runs at about the
same speed with 100 or 400Hz, so I think the problem is cured.
Regards,
