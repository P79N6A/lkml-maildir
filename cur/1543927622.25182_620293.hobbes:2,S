Additionally if we want support caching in gitweb, and not need to rewrite
cached file, then we should use absolute time everywhere in gitweb (perhaps
rewriting to relative using JavaScript, or output filter,...).
There is some cutoff where gitweb stops displaying relative time and
displays date; gitweb should also always provide absolute date in tooltip
on mouseover (in title attribute), if it does not then it is a bug.

Perhaps the following solution would be good idea:
 1. use git-describe to find nearest commit
 2. if it took long / if the distance from tag is large
    then make some special tag denoting calculated git-describe e.g.
    in tag name
 3. if found tag is helper tag created in previous step, recaulculate
    true git-describe from it, or just output closest contained tag.
This needs write access to repository, although can be done using simple
database... what do you think?
