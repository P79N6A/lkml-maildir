Subject: [Suspend2][ 08/35] [Suspend2] Reopen the resume dev_t.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/515

Having processed the resume2= setting once to get the dev_t it refers to,
we can just use the dev_t again afterwards. This routine reopens the bdev
at some later stage, getting afresh the inode and device info - something
might have been modified by the user since our last use, and it would be
wrong to keep the device open all the time anyway.
