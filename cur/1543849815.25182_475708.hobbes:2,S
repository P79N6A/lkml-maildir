I've seen crashes (rock solid - system halted, following a core dump)
occasionally when unplugging this device:
sn9c102: V4L2 driver for SN9C10x PC Camera Controllers v1:1.27
usb 2-1: SN9C10[12] PC Camera Controller detected (vid/pid 0x0C45/0x6005)
usb 2-1: TAS5110C1B image sensor detected
usb 2-1: Initialization succeeded
usb 2-1: V4L2 device registered as /dev/video0
usbcore: registered new interface driver sn9c102
It crashed 100% with 2.6.19-rc1-git6.  2.6.19-rc2-mm2: it only crashes
occasionally (1/10 times) making me suspect a lock issue.   Haven't the
foggiest where to look and as I only tested this hardware on a whim,
it's not high enough priority for me to debug.   I'm also so rusty on
drivers that my eyes would probably be of no help.
I can duplicate this on several different systems - but they're all
EHCI-based USB2 hosts.  (Intel Corporation 82801DB/DBM on this laptop)
Maybe that helps.
