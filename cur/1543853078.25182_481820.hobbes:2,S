It's a *driver model* API, which is also accessible from sysfs ... to support
per-device policies, for example the (a) workaround.  The mechanism exists
even on kernels that don't include sysfs ... although on such systems, there
is no way for users to do things like say "ignore the fact that this mouse
claims to issue wakeup events, its descriptors lie".

No; I'm saying the driver model is used to record that the hardware mechanism
isn't available.   The fact that it's because of an implementation artifact
(bad silicon, or board layout, etc) versus a design artifact (silicon designed
without that feature) is immaterial ... in either case, the system can't use
the mechanism.

ISTR they do that too.  :)

That's not an issue at all with OHCI; it only DMAs when the relevant
schedule is enabled.  Which it isn't, unless it has work to do.

Exactly.  That's why I said it's purely a power saving mechanism.
