As I stated before, we will never have more than one ilO2 device on a
system. Also, this device will only be used on x86 and x86_64
architectures. I will check in the dev_warn changes asap.

I wouldn't be surprised if this device someday turned up on non-x86
systems.  I know there's some x86 firmware stuff in there that clearly
requires x86.  But it'd be nice if the rest of the driver compiled and
worked (minus the x86 firmware functionality) on other architectures.
For example, you could wrap all the event logging code in "#ifdef
CONFIG_X86" and provide a null implementation for !X86.

This is more dangerous than using the gcc assembler operand syntax,
because it assumes things about how the parameters are put on the stack.

You might consider using dev_printk(), dev_warn(), etc, instead of most
of your printk calls.  Then you get the device ID and driver name
automatically.

The driver assumes only a single instance of the device.  But PCI being
what it is, it's often possible to have multiple cards, so you might
want some protection in case you trip over more than one.
