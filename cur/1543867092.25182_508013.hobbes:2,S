Disregard, I found the problem.
CONFIG_NEW_LED=Y , so I have to do a make and boot from the produced image.
Which brings me to another question.
If a dependent driver is selected as module (for reasons you dont want
to reboot and all), is it possible to have the dependencies built as
module aswell rather than being built into the kernel? for
CONFIG_NEW_LED I cant choose for built-in or module, it's built-in,
and that's all there is possible.
