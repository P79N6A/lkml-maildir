Hmmm... That means the updates to SLUB in mm will fix the regression that 
you are seeing because we there can use large orders of slabs and fallback
for all slab caches. But I am still interested to get to the details of
slub behavior on the 16p.

Yeah in 2.6.26-rc kmalloc-512 has 8 objects per slab. The mm version 
increases that with a larger allocation size.

Hmmm... Interesting. Lets first get the details for 2.6.25-rc. Then we can 
start toying around with the slub version in mm to configure slub in such 
a way that we get best results on both machines.
