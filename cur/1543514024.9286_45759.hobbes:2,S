Headers and code are different things

Also remember the GPL subsumes anything freer. So you can mix code that is
as free as the GPL with the GPL as GPL. This is why we can share code
with FreeBSD that doesn't have the advertising clause.
If it bugs you, write a clean GPL driver from their nailed together DLPI
glue and driver.
