What should the application do if it gets events that it didn't ask for?
If you choose to ignore them, the next time epoll_wait() is called it
will return instantly with these same messages, so the app will spin and
eat CPU.
The alternative is to put some kind of sanity-check wrapper around
epoll_wait() calls, and match the output with what the app asked for.
If epoll starts returning messages that it doesn't want, the only
alternative is to get heavy-handed and try to get epoll to shut up with
EPOLL_CTL_DEL on the file descriptor. But this seems like fighting
against the OS.
Perhaps it should only OR the user event with POLLHUP|POLLERR if
POLLIN or POLLOUT is set?
