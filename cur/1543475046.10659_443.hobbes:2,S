Don't whine, make a new mirror with both.
I thought about making ftp.de.kernel.org, but when I heard that I would
have to mirror all the archive, I decided against it.  While we are a
major university with about 50 GB for the whole FTP server, it would be
unreasonable to expect us to mirror the whole archive when >90% is
redundant.
First, I would only mirror the bz2 stuff, because network usage is paid
for by traffic, and international traffic is more expensive.  Secondly,
I would only mirror the latest .tar.bz2 kernel, the others can be
reconstructed by backwards patching.
