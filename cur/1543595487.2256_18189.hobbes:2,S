Ummm, the AS/400 was based out of Rochester, Minnesota at least initially.  It
was the follow to System/3 -> System/36 -> System/38, and customers originally
programmed it in RPG-III and Cobol.  Now that AS/400's are based on special
PowerPC's, the home may have moved to Austin, which is the PowerPC/AIX center.
The AS/400 line was intended to be the mid-range system, between the mainframes
(360 -> 370 -> 3080 -> 3900 -> ???) and the PCs.
