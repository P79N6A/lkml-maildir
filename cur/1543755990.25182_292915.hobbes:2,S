How does the hardware die? Are you sure that it is not simply a bug in
the program doing the POST? Look at the scitech source and you will
see many BIOS quirks that have to be emulated in order for the post to
work. If your post program is missing any of these the post won't
work. So far every time I have encountered a non-working post it was
fixed by tweaking some things in the post program.
