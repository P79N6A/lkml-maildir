He has the wrong permissions in
/etc/udev/permissions.d/50-udev.permissions (or whatever), or no
entry for it, and his default_mode (in /etc/udev/udev.conf) is very
restrictive, or he does not use pam_console (or using it with a
display manager?), or add some other explanation.  Personally I would
just say that he/his_distribution should fix the shipped
udev.permissions.
Apart from above, I cannot say anything is wrong with the addition of
tty's to sysfs, and if its the same in functionality as the old patch
from Greg, then I ran it for months no problem.
