Hi ppl,
just reporting on 2.6.0-test1 on sparcs:
i am trying to compile linux-2.6.0-test1-{mm1,mm2,ac1,ac2)
on 2 differents sparcs, both latest debian sid & gcc-3.2.3:
ultra enterprise 1 (sun4u sparc64)
sparc station 4    (sun4m sparc32)
on both i need to enable PCI support even
when these boxes doesn't have a PCI bus,
i think the main bus is SBUS and i get
errors when compiling the Sun ESP scsi
controller about functions for DMA depending
on PCI.  I don't think is convenient for
these old boxes having support for PCI
because enlarge the kernel and it really
doesn't have that type of bus.
And when i enable PCI support the sparc32
compiles fine but hangs inmediately on boot.
The sparc64 doesn't compile with ac2 patch:
arch/sparc64/kernel/built-in.o(.init.text+0x3bcc): In function `pdev_cookie_fillin':
: referencia a `pci_remove_bus_device' sin definir
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
The others mentioned kernels hangs when booting.
Yes, i have selected proper configuration for the
CONFIG_INPUT_*=y layer, CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y,
CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE=y and CONFIG_PROM_CONSOLE=y.
I even tried both CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE set to y/n
Any help will be apreciated as i really want
the 2.6 kernels support both sparc32 and sparc64
boxes, googling i found osinvestor.com/sparc but
is down and in the sparclinux archives there are
patches but they appear to be applied on linus
2.6.0-test1 kernel.
Thanks.
