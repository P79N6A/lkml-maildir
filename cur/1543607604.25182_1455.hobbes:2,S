This message is to thank Dr. Horst H. von Brand and to act as an 
explanation:
Over 2 month ago I questioned fstat64() and whether st_mtime was being 
updated correctly after using crontab -e reported no changes made.
Dr. Horst H. von Brand sent me the following explanation:

This was exactly the problem I was having.  I had all the evidence I
needed but I couldn't see it.  The details were as follows:
  1)  Crontab -e command created a temporary file called
      /tmp/crontab.812, and with the open file handle called fstat64()
      to get the mtime.
  2)  Crontab ran Vim on the temporary file and I edited the file and
      saved it.
      Unknown to me Vim (6.0z BETA) had replaced the /tmp/crontab.812
      file with a new one of the same name.  The stat /tmp/crontab.812
      commands I ran did show that the inode had changed but I didn't
      notice it.
  3)  Crontab then called fstat64() on its original open file handle
      to the now deleted file.  Since Vim did not edit this file its
      mtime had not changed, hence crontab reported no changes made. 
      (When a file is deleted the directory entry is removed and
      the inode link count is reduced by 1.  When the link count
      reaches 0 the file is removed, but not before all open file
      handles are closed).
Thanks,
Mike
