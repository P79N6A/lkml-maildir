I just retried it with a nc6000, it worked with "vga=normal
acpi_sleep=s3_bios rw init=/bin/bash".
It did not work from a full blown system including X etc, but this is
probably a driver problem, the machine was sitting in a docking station
which connects everything via USB. Sorry, right now i cannot debug this
further, but it basically works and should not be too hard to get going.
Also, it does not work with vesafb (I have not tried radeonfb)
