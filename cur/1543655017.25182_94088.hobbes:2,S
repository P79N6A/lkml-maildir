Lets say there is a bit of code in the kernel ( i.e.
.../kernel/ ) that needs a function that is in an
asm-gneric/*.h file.  Now someone comes along and does an
asm-x386/*.h with the same functionality but much faster asm
functions.  How should the using code be set up to get the
faster asm version if it exists and the generic version if
it does not?
