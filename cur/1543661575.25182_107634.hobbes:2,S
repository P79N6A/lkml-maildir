I sit on the web interface a lot to see what's being merged. If you ask for
it, it will give you a list of csets ordered by date, newest first. I've
noticed sometimes that recently merged csets will appear to be older than
the date they were merged, perhaps because they actually were that old in
the parent repository. Is cset age preserved across repositories? It seems
to be.
If this is the case, then the cset was merged recently but the actual change
was done a long time ago. When did this get merged?
(BTW, Larry, the bk binaries segfault on my (glibc 2.3.1) i686 system. Any
chance we could see binaries linked against 2.3.x? There's NSS badness between
2.2 and 2.3 that causes even static binaries to segfault ... )
Thanks,
Matt
