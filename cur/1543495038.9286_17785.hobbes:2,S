 Careful.  This is dead wrong.  The assignment will always be made,
othwise the compiler is flat broken.  If we were testing whether the
assignment was made, this expression would ALWAYS be true (which is NOT
the case).

 why, this is a simple assignment. there is nothing to prioritize here.

          if ( left = right )
 although the first and last are rather bad form, all three of these
lines are functionally equiv, and will generate identical object code.
The first simply contains a superfluous set of parens.

 until recently, C/C++ did not have boolean values- it simply checks for
non-zero results of the enclosing expression.

 'if (a = b)' is not an error, it is however sloppy form.
