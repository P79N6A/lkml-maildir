For the third time this thread, yes, you can, you just have to escape 
the path name to prevent the win32 api from translating the name to the 
non existent AUX device.  From a command line you can do:
echo foo > \\?\c:\aux
And it will work just fine.  The only place the name "AUX" has any 
meaning is in the win32 api layers that translate certain device names 
to the real kernel path.  The kernel and filesystem will store whatever 
name you choose for compatibility with the posix subsystem.
