This will hopefully happen in the future. In fact mcelog has support
to decode using DMI tables, but it turns out this doesn't work
very well in practice (both because of BIOS problems and because
the DMI standard was not really designed for this). That is why
I wouldn't advocate right now to move this code from mcelog
into the kernel. This might change later.

I've been looking at using EFI runtime services for this, but it's
also somewhat problematic (e.g. getting the messages out again in
a useful way without risking duplicating events)
There are also a few other candidates like the Management Engine
interface on many Intel platforms, but it's also not available everywhere.
Short term just changing the MCE panic to timeout by default
is the best option. I'll probably submit that for .30
