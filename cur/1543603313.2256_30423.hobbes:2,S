Lilo is fine, back down to the kernel image prior to your current one, 
run lilo with your new image, then boot into the new image.
Lilo can now be run just fine.
Something in the pre10 series hosed something which caused the first 
instance of lilo to segfault then the next to deadlock waiting on a 
page.  2.4.10 proper fixed that.  In my case I reverted to 2.4.7-pre6, 
ran lilo, then booted into 2.4.10 and ran lilo.  Worked like a charm. 
 ('course I had a boot disk at the ready)
