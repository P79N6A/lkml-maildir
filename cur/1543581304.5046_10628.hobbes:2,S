Better still, follow the lead from other Solaris and HP-UX.
/dev/dsk/* block access for hard drives
/dev/rdsk/* char access for hard drives
/dev/diskette block access for floppy drives
/dev/rdiskette char access for floppy drives
/dev/rscsi/* char access for raw scsi (replace /dev/sg* )
Since linux currently doesn't have char access to drives,
rdsk/rdiskette would be ignored untill it is implemented
and needed.
