Right you are.  The commands cdparanoia uses are:
TEST_UNIT_READY
INQUIRY
MODE_SELECT
MODE_SENSE
READ_10
READ_12
READ_TOC
MODE_SELECT_10
MODE_SENSE_10
GPCMD_READ_CD
GPCMD_READ_CD_MSF
0xD4 (10-byte read on old Sony and NEC drives)
0xD4 (12-byte read on some old drives)
0xD5 (10-byte read on some old drives)
0xD8 (12-byte read on some old drives)
0xE5 (10-byte read on Creative/Acer cdd522,525,620,622)
For 0xD4/0xD5/0xD8, I'm not particularly sure which drives require
them; cdparanoia currently takes a heuristic approach to detecting the
available command set, and the data for what drives they come from
isn't in the code.
MODE_SELECT is used to set the block size for reads, as is MODE_SELECT_10.
For all but the MODE_SELECT ones, there's a patch below, but it's all
for vendor-specific commands.  For the mode selects, we're either
going to need some sort of device class mechanism, or for these to be
modifiable at boot time by userland.  Or, of course, startup/login
scripts can just give your user +w on the device if it knows its a CD
drive.
I'm not a big fan of having the vendor-specific commands here either,
but there's not a better way right now.  I imagine this patch will be
vetoed for security concerns because of them.
