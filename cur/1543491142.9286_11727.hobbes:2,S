As first thanks again to MikeG for forwarding me this email while the
kernel list is down here ;).

Note that you should also revert to freeing at least the freelist (this is
the reason Linus posted the patch against 2.2.4) and all other lru-list if
the BUF_CLEAN is empty.
But more important you could have the first entry in the lru list not
freeable (don't ask me why ;), and in such case you would have big
stability problems.
Note that in 
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/andrea-tree/2.2.4_andrea3.bz2
 I am
just freeing pages in shrink_mmap() in perfect lru basis (taking care also
of buffer aging). But I am doing it at the pagemap level. I see it far
more clean and general. I am touching the buffer not in bread but in
get_hash_table and in getblk if the buffer is not found in the hash table.
Performances are impressive here. I can checkin a whole linux CVS tree in
2sec. Having a perfect lru rocks.
