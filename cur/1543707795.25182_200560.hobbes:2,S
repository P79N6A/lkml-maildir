Subject: [PATCH][0/4] poll()/select() timeout behavior
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The following patches against linux-2.6.3 address several issues related
to timeouts in sys_poll() and sys_select().  The same problems exist in
2.4. One or more of the (trivially small) patches may be controversial,
so I've split them for purposes of discussion.
