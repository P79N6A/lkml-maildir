The packet likely doesn't fit into the socket buffer and is silently 
dropped. The TCP stack doesn't force an ACK in this case, but it 
probably should, although it wouldn't solve the deadlock. The deadlock
will be only solved if the local application reads data and clears the
socket buffer. If you have a single packet that is bigger than the
empty socket buffer / 2 you lose.
You can check the allocated socket buffer size using netstat.  
You can increase it using the /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_{default,max} 
sysctls; in 2.4 there is also a TCP memory limit that can be tuned
using /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mem. Doubling one of these will probably
fix your problems. 
Normally the socket buffer should not overflow if the sender honors 
the TCP window protocol, but there are some corner cases where it can
still happen, e.g. when the application sends lots of small packets
(which all have fixed metadata overhead) or the device driver always
hands full MTU sized packets to the stack.
2.4.4+ has some fixes that should make these corner cases less likely.
It cannot be completely solved unfortunately.
