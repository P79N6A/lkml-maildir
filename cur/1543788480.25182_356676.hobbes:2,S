Blocks read by bread() and friends are cached in block device (not you
:-) struct address_space. File data are cached in the per-inode struct
address_space.

Now 2 pages are cached in memory in address_space associated with inode.

This reads blocks directly from the disk (igrnoing cached copy), and
caches them in block device address_space.

This makes changes to the block cached in block device address_space.

vi uses read(1), and, hence, will fetch data from inode address_space,
where original pages still live.

And this will read from block device cache.

You are bypassing normal file sysetm caching and results can be
unpredictable.
