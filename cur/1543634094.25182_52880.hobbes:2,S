You are refering to the naming of this 4-tuple, right: HCIL vs. CBTU?
I chose for CBTU, because that on's used in devfs. Actually, as you can see
from scsidev, I like HCIL more. But that's a detail the kernel should not
care about. The header line should be removed anyway as Albert remarked.
And helping those people who think that 200 bytes is unacceptable bloat.

I'm not sure I know what you mean. The fact that I decided to put
the sg device name first independently of the (potentially) random
order in which high-level drivers are assigned?

It is.

Just I decided to report shg first. This has a very pratical reason:
I you want to use userspace tools to collect more advanced (and maybe type
dependant information), you will always want to use the sg device, which 
you can use to send SCSI commands and which you can open, even if there is
no medium or if the device is in use.

This looks find to me as well, by the way.
The reason why I chose to additionally report the device type reported by
inquiry is that you will only see the attached (and thus only the loaded)
high-level drivers of a device. With the device type, a userspace tool could
easily decide whether to trigger a modprobe and start again ...

I still think the easy /proc/scsi/map format would be a nice basis to
inquire more information on the SCSI devices from userspace, even if you add
hierarchical attachment information via driverfs. And I think a solution
that works with both 2.4 and 2.5 would help most users, of course.
