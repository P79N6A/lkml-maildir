Don't need to be smarter, just to know more about program behaviour and 
desired system response than the o/s. Think of it as providing more 
information to the o/s and letting the o/s autotune with the additional 
information if that makes you feel better ;-)
The only tune I really want, and I patched it in 2.4.18 or so, is the 
ability to reserve some memory which will never be used for anything but 
program pages. Or some way to stop a program making a single pass 
through a large file (80GB) from pushing programs out of memory. I'm 
watching that now as I read the list, vmstat says si/so are about 800 
each, on a system which runs at zero otherwise.
I'm going to look at capabilities when I get that mythical free time, 
and see if I can let a few programs lock their ass in memory, having 
60-80% of RAM dedicated to once-read pages is silly.
Sorry for the rant, but this is the single most common problem I see 
with performance.
