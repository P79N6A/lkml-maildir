Subject: [PATCH] ipmi: fix event queue limit
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The event handler mechanism in the IPMI driver had a limit on the
number of received events, but the counts were not being updated.
Update the counts to impose a limit.  This is not a critical fix,
as this function (the sending of the events) has to be turned on
by the user, anyway.  This avoids problems if they forget to
turn it back off.
