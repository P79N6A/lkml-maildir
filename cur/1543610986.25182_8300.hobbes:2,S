two comments. First, this has already been done - Andrew Morton has
written such a patch.
Second, as i've repeatedly said it, it's a failure to do this over /proc.
What if /proc is not mounted? What if the process is in a chroot()
environment, should it not be able to set its own affinity? This is a
fundamental limitation of your approach, and *if* we want to export the
cpus_allowed affinity to user-space (which is up to discussion), then the
right way (TM) to do it is via a syscall.
