Welcome to the awful wireless driver API.  This type crapola is a key
thing that needs changing, but its not the only thing.  There are also
some nasty wireless APIs which do casts based on variable (passed-in)
struct offsets...
This needs to change to a type-safe thingy like struct ethtool_ops, but
the above is what we were lumped with.
