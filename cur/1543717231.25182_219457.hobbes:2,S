Apologies, but I don't follow this.
It was my understanding that the (potentially) many threads of a single 
process all share a canonical file descriptor table. Hence as long as 
the various calls you mention are issued in a guaranteed order, 
maintaining state as you go (which is what the 1 second sleep in the 
test code was a very quick and dirty way to almost do), I don't see how 
a race condition arises.
If I were to replace the sleep (1) with, say a global semaphore or 
something similar, would your explanation still hold?
