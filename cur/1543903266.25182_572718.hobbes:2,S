The other thing is that "legacy" in this context is fungible.  No IOMMU
was legacy until the Intel x86-64 chips came out, and I can promise you
that some legacy code will be necessary once we start seeing VIA and
others come out with embedded x86-64.
On the other hand, it's pretty bloody safe to assume that we'll never
see an x86-64 chip without CPUID, CMOV, FXSAVE, SSE-2, CMPXCHG, etc.
