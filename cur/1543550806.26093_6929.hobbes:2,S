Search the linux-kernel archives for the terms
"wake one" and "wake all".
The 2.2.5 kernel you're using (why the hell are you using that?!?!)
only supports wake all semantics, meaning that ALL waiting httpd
processes get woken up on an incoming connection.
It would be interesting to see what happens if you also use a
2.4 kernel to do the same tests and compare the results...

Rik
