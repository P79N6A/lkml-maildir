Which is why, IMO, we should endeavor to make drivers as cookie-cutter
and dirt simple to create as possible.  It will probably take many
months, but I would like to continually factor out from the net drivers
not only common code but -design patterns-.
As an experiment a couple months ago, I got most of the PCI net drivers
down to ~200-300 lines of C code apiece, by factoring out common code
patterns into M4 macros.  "m4 netdrivers.m4 epic100.tmpl > epic100.c"
I would prefer to make drivers so dirt simple that people don't need to
worry about details like PCI DMA API changes...
	Jeff, dreams on
