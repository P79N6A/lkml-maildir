Mrs. Abdul Esther,
Demark Lout Street,
93050 Kuching,
Sarawak,Malaysia
Beloved Friend,
I am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great
sorrow in my heart because my Doctor told me that I will die in
three months time due to my illness causer. Base on this
development I want to will my money which is deposited in a security
company. I sound pessimistic about my health because from the
look of things here in the hospital, I know I will surely die
anytime. All my hairs are falling off. I am also finding it a
difficult to breath freely because of the internal injuries. I am in
search of a reliable person who will use the Money to build charity
organization for the saints and the person will take 20% of the
total sum. While 80% of the money will go to charity organization
and helping the
 orphanage. I grew up as an Orphan and i don't have
anybody/family member to take care of my wealth. The total money in
question is $3.5million dollars. I will provide you with other
information's once you indicate your willingness.
Please do contact me on my personal email,because i may not be able
to open this dating site any longer due to my precarious
condition.you can now contact me If really you are out to take up
this great challenge.Waiting to read your message. I have limited internet
access in the hospital.So I am still stuck to the laptop to read your message.
contact me on my private email:
mrsestherabdul11@yahoo.com in your next reply.
Yours sincerely.
Mrs Abdul Esther.
