Others have addressed several points already, I just want to come
back to the scalability issues to make my point clear:

Consider the following:
1) kue_read() has a while(1) which loops around and delivers messages
one-by-one (to the best of my understanding of the code you posted).
Hence, delivery time increases with the number of events. In contrast,
relayfs can deliver tens of thousands of events in a single shot.
2) by having to maintain next and prev pointers, kue consumes more
memory than relayfs (at least 8 bytes/message more actually, on a
32-bit machine.) For large messages, the impact is negligeable, but
the smaller the messages the bigger the overhead.
3) by having to go through the next/prev pointers, accessing message
X requires reading all messages before it. This can be simplified
with relayfs if: a) equal-sized messages are used, b) sub-buffers
are used. [Other kue calls are also handicapped by similar problems,
such as the deletion of the entire list.]

Right, but by reusing the event, older data is thereby destroyed
(undelivered). Which comes back to what I (and others) have been
saying: kue requires the sender's data structures to exist until
their content is delivered.

Right, but then you have 2 layers of buffering/queing instead
of a single one.

Right, but kue has to loop through the queue to deliver the messages
one-by-one. The more messages there are, the longer the delivery time.
Not to mention that you first have to copy it to user-space before
the reader can do write() to put it to permanent storage. With relafys,
you just do write() and you're done.
