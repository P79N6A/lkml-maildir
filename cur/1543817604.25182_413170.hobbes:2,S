I think you misread the C standard then. This only applies when you ONLY
include the headers defined in the standard, and no others.

if you follow this argument then ANY library, be it glibc or gtk or
mysql or .. can only add __ things. That is not the case. Think of
"non-indirect" kernel header includes as including a header for a
library.
Maybe an example is needed: include/mtd/mtd-abi.h  
Well it's a slightly bad example since it uses stdint.h types not __u64
types. But assume it used __u64 types, then this header would be
perfectly fine, including from a standards point of view.

yes this the example where __u64 needs underscores, and headers need to
use __u64 as they have to today.

exactly. Nowhere is linux/* or asm/* in the standards as specified.

ok now I'm confused. How is providing FUNCTIONALITY such as setting
bitops the right thing for such headers? I would argue that the clean
headers should absolutely NOT do that but only provide the INTERFACE.
(this is also there for a license angle btw, if you actually start to
provide large bodies of code this way the lawyers will get unhappy wrt
the GPL; it's a LOT better to strictly do interface things only, eg
types, defines and prototypes)
In general:
I think you're focusing WAY too much on the __u64 kind of thing, which
is the vast minority of the ABI work, the ioctl structs are the big one.
For the __u64 kind of thing I would strongly suggest that you stick to
the currently already used symbols; anything existing knows to stay
clear of those already, so things are fine there so lets keep it simple
for those.
