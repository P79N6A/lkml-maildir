Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 08:01
I am using Caldera OpenLinux 2.2 and have successfully built an SMP kernel, but
I get the above message when trying to boot with it.  Since Caldera is only at
2.2.5, and the most recent release kernel is 2.2.10, I suspect I may have to
grab the most recent source and rebuild from scratch.  I have tried to search
everywhere I can find to see if this problem is known and fixed by a later
version.  If someone can point me in an appropriate direction, I would be most
appreciative.
Set up:
    Caldera OpenLinux 2.2 (Linux 2.2.5 kernel)
    Micron MilleniaPro/2 200MHz, 64MB RAM
    Adaptec AHA-2940 UltraSCSI/Seagate ST39173
    3c509, 3c905 adaptors
Feel free to flame me if this question has been asked repeatedly, but at least
tell me where to look!  The search engine at
http://www.linuxhq.com/lnxlists/linux-kernel
 does not work, and I find no other
source for lkml archives.
Thanks in Advance -
