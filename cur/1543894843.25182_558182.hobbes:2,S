And that doesn't matter. In the context of the GPLv2 the only legally active 
parts *ARE* in the GPLv2, under this heading:
                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
No other text published by the FSF has any legal bearing on the GPLv2 *except* 
when it is the FSF that holds copyright to the work and has placed it under 
the GPLv2. When I place a program under the GPL, it becomes *my* 
interpretation of the license and those "published texts" I might have (that 
are relevant to the situation) which have bearing on the license.

Nope. Because the intent of the author of the license is worth nothing. The 
intent of the person who has placed the code under the GPL is, however, worth 
quite a bit.

In the context of the license it means that the copyright holder is placing no 
restrictions. And that is because they legally *cannot* - as you agreed. But 
the copyright holder *can*, OTOH, make it clear that they wish for there to 
be no limits, artificial or otherwise, placed on the code.

And the preamble carries no legal weight.
