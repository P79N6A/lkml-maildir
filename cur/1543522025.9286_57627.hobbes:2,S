     For what it's worth, I built it on Pentium system, Asus motherboard,
200mhz Pentium using gcc version 2.7.2.3, and got exactly the same thing.  The
machine hangs indefinitely at that point but will respond to
control-alt-delete.  I believe this was originally RedHat 4.2 distribution
though much has been upgraded since the original install.  2.2.14 works fine on
this same machine.
