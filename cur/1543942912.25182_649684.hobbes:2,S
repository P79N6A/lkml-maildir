I would have, but I didn't see the original offender in my upstream
branch, so I just applied it separately - looks to me like fcprint.c
hasn't been touched (until your patch) since its introduction:
ericvh@ericvh-desktop:~/src/linux/9p$ git log net/9p/fcprint.c
commit bd238fb431f31989898423c8b6496bc8c4204a86

    9p: Reorganization of 9p file system code
    This patchset moves non-filesystem interfaces of v9fs from fs/9p to net/9p.
    It moves the transport, packet marshalling and connection layers to net/9p
    leaving only the VFS related files in fs/9p.  This work is being done in
    preparation for in-kernel 9p servers as well as alternate 9p clients (other
    than VFS).
