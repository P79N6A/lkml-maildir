They are not different branches. Perhaps what is confusing him (and sometimes
also confuses me), is that there are patches in aa kernel (I am not a
compulsive patcher...) that look like basic bug fixes or simple but effective
enhancements that never reach mainline, they are only in aa for ages (looking
at andrea's dir in ftp.kernel.org: all the _vm patches, the spinlock-cacheline,
compiler.h, rwsem, parent-timeslice, etc.). Nothing wrt numa, tux, uml or lvm.
How about a 18-pre1 taking from aa all that is usefull and not really intrusive ?
