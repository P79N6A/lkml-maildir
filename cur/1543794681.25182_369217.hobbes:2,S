Can you please explain clearly:
- What are you changing.
- What was the problem with the old behaviour
- Why that particular change
- Why can't that APIC number setup not be done by the BIOS itself
Thanks.
Please note there is a high barrier of entry for any kind of BIOS workarounds -
in particular for LinuxBIOS i'm not very motivated because you guys can
just fix the BIOS.
