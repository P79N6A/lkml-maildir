Could I ask where the information which permitted this (nice-looking) driver to
be written came from?
Trivia:
There's some whitespace damage in there.  Please search the diff for "^ "
and fix it up.
We indent the body of switch statements one tab stop less than this driver
does.
The driver has lots of really big inlined functions.  It's best to uninline
these.  If the function has a single callsite, gcc will inline it anyway. 
If the function has multiple callsites (now, or in the future), inlining it
is undesirable.
The driver has a lot of things like
	static inline void* tifm_get_drvdata(struct tifm_dev *dev)
whereas we prefer
	static inline void *tifm_get_drvdata(struct tifm_dev *dev)
