Nope. modversions are information about the ABI/API and objects referenced
directly or indirectly from them.  The policy is entirely in modutils.
Modutils has the power to say "well that looks kind of the same I'll bind
that symbol name".
Kernel -> "Here is a helpful set of ABI compatibility hashes"
Modutils -> "This symbol doesnt match, what do we want to do about it. Lets
	     fail". It could equally pick something looking similar.

People who start using capital letters always seem to have emotional rather
than logical reasons for their argument.
