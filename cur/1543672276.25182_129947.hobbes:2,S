So can we say that, during initialization, setup.s pushes some bios info 
to the memory, and then after entering protected mode in i386, it pops
these information and sets kernel depending on it. Because of absence of
FDC controller info at this data area linux does not recognize FDC. However,
I can turn it on still usin IO ports and using in, out assembly instructions.
what i mention above for sure is not correct, however, is the procedure something like that?
thank you..
