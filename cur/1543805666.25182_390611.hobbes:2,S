I think it's better than adding many HAVE_ARCH_*_BITOPS.
I will have 14 new headers. So I want to make new directory
include/asm-generic/bitops/:
include/asm-generic/bitops/atomic.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/nonatomic.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/__ffs.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/ffz.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/fls.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/fls64.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/find.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/ffs.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/sched-ffs.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/hweight.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/hweight64.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/ext2-atomic.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/ext2-nonatomic.h
include/asm-generic/bitops/minix.h
