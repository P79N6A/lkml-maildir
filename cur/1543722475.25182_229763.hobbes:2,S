It's difficult to come up with comprehensible semantic refinements.
The trick with slab is whole slabs are frequently pinned by active
references, so there's quite a bit of squishiness there even after
SLAB_RECLAIM_ACCOUNT is figured out. A counter in the slab header for
references is plausibly precise, but appears to too invasive to ever
put into place. A less invasive refinement may be to clear_page_wired()
for empty slab pages.
Thanks for spotting rd.c's blkdev pagecache; that's a bogon in my
patches.
Also, I should mention this concept is based on code seen in RHEL3,
which uses a __GFP_WIRED flag, albeit for a different purpose (it
appears to be centered around removing dirty ramfs pagecache from
the LRU lists(s) as opposed to accounting for OOM-related reasons).
