Mixing O_DIRECT i/o and cached i/o is probably a recipe for disaster,
unless the cooperating programs are very careful and very aware of how
the particular file system in the particular kernel implements direct
i/o and caching, including cache validation.
This seems like a dangerous enough area that denying mmap on a file which
has been opened with O_DIRECT by any process and denying open(O_DIRECT)
on a file which has been mmap'd would be a good thing.  These things are
easy enough to keep track of, so it shouldn't be too hard to implement.
    Thanx...
