Subject: Simple question on files & sockets in kernel space.

I would like to be able to read/write a file in the
regular file system (like /tmp/mystuff.txt) from the
kernel space.  In user-space, I'd use open() and then
read() and write().  Can someone suggest a piece of kernel
code or documentation that does something like this?
I would also like to get a TCP/IP socket and read/write
to it in a similar manner.  Basically, I want the familiarity
of user-space, but I have to implement most of the functionality
in the kernel.
Thanks,
Ben
