Do you know why? Is it because the average seek distance becomes
smaller with your algorithm? (I later realized that request merging is
done before the elevator function kicks in, so your algorithm should
not produce more seeks than a CSCAN algorithm. Unfortunately I didn't
realize this when I wrote my CSCAN patch.)
Btw, does anyone know how the seek time depends on the seek distance
on modern disk hardware?
