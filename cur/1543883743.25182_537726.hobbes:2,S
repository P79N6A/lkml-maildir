i2o/device.c should be GFP_KERNEL as far as I can tell. It was meant to
be that way and the callers appear to all be calling it in sleep capable
contexts.
aic7xxx_old.c should probably be GFP_KERNEL as ->slave_alloc methods
appear to be able to sleep (although some drivers use GFP_ATOMIC here and
some GFP_KERNEL).
