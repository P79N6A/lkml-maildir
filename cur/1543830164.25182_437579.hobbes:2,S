Hi Nick,
We are using SLOB allocator, why need to set PageSlab?
If later there come forth another type of allocator(SLEB, SLUB), Do we
still need to set PageSlab bit?
On the other hand, I'm not sure if the current SLOB code works
properly on the MMU system. If so, I think changing the nommu.c should
be a better solution.
Regards,
-Aubrey
