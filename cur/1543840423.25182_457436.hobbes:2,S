kmalloc is really slow actually - it always shows somewhere on top 
in profiles and brings noticeble overhead (as was shown in network tree 
allocator project, although there were used bigger allocations).
I chose 3 ukevents, since they fit exactly one cache line (on my test
machine). In general I try to avoid allocation as much as possible, and
more generic usage case (for various servers) to accept one client and
add it, instead of waiting for several of them and commit them at once.
