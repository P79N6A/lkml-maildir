debian uses a highly patched udevstart and calls it udevsyntesize.
needed some time to figure that out when chasing failures of ubuntu's
initramfs-tools which in debian use the newer udevsyntesize.
the patches can be seen at:
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/u/udev/udev_0.071-1.diff.gz
but more easily if you apply that to the unpacked
http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/u/udev/udev_0.071.orig.tar.gz
