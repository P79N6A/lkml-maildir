Again the compat layer is only supposed to be as good as a native 32bit
kernel. You try to make it better by allowing values that a 32bit
kernel wouldn't allow. But that's not its goal - it just wants to be 
as compatible as possible.

The goal isn't to be clear, the goal is to be compatible.
Please stop continue arguing about this - it's useless.
