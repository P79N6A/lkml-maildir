Looking at the code, ext4_ext_ext_grow_indepth() implements tree growing
procedure. It allocates a new index block, moves the top-level data of
the tree(root or leaf blocks in i_data) into the new block, initializes
the new root, creating index that points to the just created index block
The original top-level data (in i_data) could be extent tree root (index
block) or extents (leaf block). The current code (without the patch)
treats the top-level data always be the leaf block, which is incorrect.
assumes when the tree is growing the extent structure pass in is always
