Hello,
here my patch for PPS support against kernel 2.6.24:
   
http://ftp.enneenne.com/pub/misc/linuxpps/patches/ntp-pps-2.6.24.diff
The code has been tested by some guys intered in PPS stuff and it
seems ok. :)
Please report your suggestions in order to get kernel inclusion.
Thanks in advance,
Rodolfo
