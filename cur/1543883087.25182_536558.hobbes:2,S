The underscore always goes before the final t (short for type I assume).
The typedefs in the kernel do the same... kmem_cache_t (now replaced,
though) as an example.

#undef u32
#undef u_int32_t

Once again, \b comes to the rescue! :)
[And it also works with u32 at SOL and EOLs, and -o counts the number of
occurrences, not the number of lines]

The tendency towards __uX and uX is probably because these have been
existent since decades, even before stdint.h and uintX_t got introduced.
Which btw, is another point. Userspace programs that need to include
files from /usr/include/linux sometimes have a hard time compiling
because they want u8, which is defined (or not!) somewhere in
/usr/include/asm. Maybe it is not a problem anymore today, but I had
had it often enough to call it a problem. This is where uintX_t could come
a little more handy, because userspace has a higher chance of already
knowing it through stdint.h or some compiler foo.
