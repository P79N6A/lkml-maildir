Hmm, I'm not sure. They are modeled after the put_{short,int,uint,...}
functions that only exist in block/ioctl.c and I put them in so I
could use almost identical code in the native and compat path.
If we find these generally useful, I guess we could have both
versions of each of these functions in global headers, e.g. in
linux/uaccess.h and linux/compat.h, but right now I would recommend
using plain put_user in all compat code except for block ioctl.
