In practice, the meaning of 0 is file system [driver] dependent. For 
example in case of NTFS-3G it means that the block is sparse or the file is 
encrypted or compressed, or resident, or it's the $Boot file, or an error 
happened.
Thankfully the widely used FIBMAP users (swapon and the ever less used 
lilo) are only interested in the non-zero values and they report an error 
if the driver returns 0 for some reason. Which is perfectly ok since both 
swaping and Linux booting would fail using a sparse, encrypted, compressed, 
resident, or the NTFS $Boot file. 
But in real, both swap files and lilo work fine with NTFS if the needed 
files were created the way these softwares expect. If not then swapon or 
lilo will catch and report the file creation error.
Afair, somebody is doing (has done?) an indeed much needed, better 
alternative. Bmap is legacy, thank you Mike for maintaining it.
