This is one of the worst pieces of FUD I've ever seen.
Note their use of "performs UP TO 150% better" everywhere in the text.
I'm sure you can set up tests where NT performs 150% better, while in
normal operation it performs about 400% worse...
-40000% to +150% can very well be described as "UP TO 150% better". :/
