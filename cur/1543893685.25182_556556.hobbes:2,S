Can you please tell me _what_ else can be done?

Well, AFAICS, Suresh has tried to debug one failing case recently without
any consistent conclusions.  I don't know of any other test cases (links,
please?).

You are probably right, but OTOH I've tried the CPU hotplug via the sysfs
interface for _many_ times and it has _never_ failed for me.

All kinds of suspend, not only hibernation.

Sorry, but that's how it goes.
We've been using that code for more then a year now and I'd expect someone
to tell us that it's wrong a bit earlier.
If you are telling us to drop it now, then _please_ advise what we can use
instead, because we obviously need the functionality.
