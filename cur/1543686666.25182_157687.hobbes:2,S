I've used cp & Midnight Commander (mc). Also when someone uploads big
file 
on server through
samba, speed sometimes fall down to zero.
Have no idea about scsi, drives are IDE.
Hello,
Let's see if we can eliminate this HW constraint:
Do you have the 2 HDs at the same IDE port (primary or secondary) or at
different IDE ports?
It might be related to the fact that IDE driver can't send 2
simultaneous cmds to 2 different drives if they are attached to the same
IDE port.
This is a simple point, but I hope we don't overlook it when making the
comparison between Linux and *dows. :-)

Anthony Dominic Truong.
