Well, a runtime-set function-pointer isn't all that bad.  Basically
if a simple cycle-counter driver is available, it would use that,
otherwise it would fall back to ordinary spinlock behavior.

That's lock-free FD lookup (open, close, and read/write to a certain
extent).  I'm handling something more like serialization on a fifo
accessed in both user context and interrupt context, which in a
traditional implementation would use a spinlock, but with a spinaphore,
one could do this:
In interrupt context:
spinaphore_lock_atomic(&fifo->sph);
put_stuff_in_fifo(fifo,stuff);
spinaphore_unlock(&fifo->sph);
In user context:
spinaphore_lock(&fifo->sph);
put_stuff_in_fifo(fifo,stuff);
spinaphore_unlock(&fifo->sph);
If there are multiple devices generating interrupts to put stuff in the
fifo and multiple processes also trying to put stuff in the fifo, all
bursting on different CPUs, then the fifo lock would be heavily loaded.
If the system had other things it could be doing while waiting for the
FIFO to become available, then it should be able to do those.
Cheers,
