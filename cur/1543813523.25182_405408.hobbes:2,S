Please do not beat me up for suggesting this. I was wondering if it
makes sense to add a PF_SHRINKER flag and set it in shrink_slab().
Use my solution, instead of PF_MEMALLOC check against PF_SHRINKER.
I think PF_SHRINKER might be a good idea, it might help us detect
races between the shrinker and other subsystems too - not only dcache.
It might be well worth adding in. If there is sufficient interest I can
send create and send out a patch.
