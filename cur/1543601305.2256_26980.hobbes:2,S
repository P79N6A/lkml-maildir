Well, what I meant was: compared to the _same_ situation and test bed, the load
seems "pretty high". ac versions are somewhat lower in this setup.

Hm, remember my setup: I read a lot from CD, write it to disk and read a lot
from nfs and write it to disk. Basically both are read once - write once
setups, so the pages are touched once (or worst twice) at maximum, so I see a
good chance none of them ever make it to the active list, according to your
state explanation from previous posts. And thats what I see (I guess). If I do
a CD compare (read disk, read CD and compare) I see lots of pages walk over to
active. And that again looks as you told before. I think it does work as you
said.
Anyway I cannot "feel" a difference in performance (maybe even worse than
before), but it _looks_ cleaner. How about taking it as a first step in the
cleanup direction? :-)
