I don't know. I do know that the normal CRC is not just appended in the
NE* SNIC. You can 'remote DMA' data both ways and when you get it back
it doesn't have the CRC. Several years ago I tried for a long time to
be able to read the CRC of the packet I was about to send. We use these
things are RF modulators in a UWB communications system.
It looks as though the normal CRC is appended during the actual transmit.
If the offset of the checksum was known to a controller, it could fill in
the checksum using the same mechanism.
