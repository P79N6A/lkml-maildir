nitpicking: i guess the answer also depends on what the precise 
requirement is. If the requirement is 'run for 4 seconds every 10 
seconds, uninterrupted, else the power plant melts down', i'd sure not 
make the washing machine process the higher priority one ;-)
(also, i'd give the power plant process higher priority even if the 
requirement is not as strict, just from a risk POV: what if the washing 
machine control program is buggy and got into an infinite loop 
somewhere.)
