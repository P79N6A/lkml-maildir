Subject: Kobject: drop child->parent ref at unregistration
To: Greg KH <greg@kroah.com>, Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>
Cc: Kernel development list <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>
Message-ID: <Pine.LNX.4.44L0.0711191047230.4806-100000@iolanthe.rowland.org>
This patch (as1015) reverts changes that were made to the driver core
about four years ago.  The intent back then was to avoid certain kinds
of invalid memory accesses by leaving kernel objects allocated as long
as any of their children were still allocated.  The original and
correct approach was to wait only as long as any children were still
_registered_; that's what this patch reinstates.
This fixes a problem in the SCSI core made visible by the class_device
to regular device conversion: A reference loop (scsi_device holds
reference to request_queue, which is the child of a gendisk, which is
the child of the scsi_device) prevents the data structures from being
released, even though they are deregistered okay.
It's possible that this change will cause a few bugs to surface,
things that have been hidden for several years.  They can be fixed
easily enough by having the child device take an explicit reference to
the parent whenever needed.
