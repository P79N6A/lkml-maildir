Object labeling (or labeled security) looks simple and straight forward way,
but it's not.
(1) Object labeling has a assumption that labels are always properly
defined and maintained. This can not be easily achieved.
(2) Also, assigning a label is something like inventing and assigning
a *new* name (label name) to objects which can cause flaws.
 I'm not saying labeled security or SELinux is wrong.  I just wanted to
remind that  the important part is the "process" not the "result". :-)
