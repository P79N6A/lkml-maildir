It's alrweady there, but with a bit mis-leading name.
bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
To see the repository in your browser use:
http://linux.bkbits.net
 and select the linux-2.5 repository.
The reason to keep the linux-2.5 name is simply that renaming the repository
would cause parent information to be void for all people pulling
from this directory.
To my knowledge there is no possibility to symlink two repositories, so
both names could live in parrallel for a while??
