Didn't test it yet with 2.6.23-rc2 or rc3, but up to 2.6.22 it was fine :)
Regarding the option to blacklist VIA in the module:
I would prefer blacklisting VIA by default but giving the module some 
parameter like "honours inactive bit" to override this.
Perhaps there are newer VIA Chips out there, that indeed do this and some 
users trigger happy enough to test this. :)
