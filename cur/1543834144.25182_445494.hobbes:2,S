That probably the cause of my problem. Thanks for the info!
BTW: I think there was nothing important on the broken filesystems, but
I'd like to keep what's still there anyway just in case... How would you
suggest should I copy that data? I fear, just mounting and using cp 
might break and shutdown the FS again, would xfsdump be more
appropriate?
Thanks for XFS, I am using it for years in production servers!
