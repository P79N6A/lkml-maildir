Really?  Would you show me the call path from the spin lock aquire
to try_to_swap_out?  I don't see it. 
I do see

attached to try_to_swap_out, so that's probably enough not to
call schedule, but I don't see any such spinlock held.  Moreover,
the comment would seem to indicate it _is_ legal to sleep, so
long as you indicate that it happened.
