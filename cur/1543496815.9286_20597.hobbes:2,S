Hi all,
    I am new to this concept of line disciplines. I wanted to perform
    data transfer thru serial ports after performing some processing
    on raw data.For this I have written a program which has routines
    for the linedisc entry points.
    Now I want the existing char driver(/usr/src/linux/drivers/
    char/serial.c)to use my linedisc routines.
    when I went thru the source code I found that the calls to the disc
    routines from serial.c are done in tty_io.c
    (/usr/src/linux/drivers/char/tty_io.c).
    Now the problem is how do I tell the tty_io.c to access my disc
    routines?
    Is it possible to register my linedisc without making it a network
    interface/driver?   
     Could u please tell me the sequence of steps needed to solve my
     problem.If not could u please suggest some sources where I can
     reach out for help.
     Thanx in advance
     regards
     HVC
