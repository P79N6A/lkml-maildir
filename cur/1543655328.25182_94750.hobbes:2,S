Patch looks ok to me, I'll queue it.
I agree about IO-APIC -- though I also think the reports that replacing 
via-rhine with linuxfet, and changing nothing else, helps the situation.
It might be something cosmetic like silly dev->tx_timeout handling, or 
it might be something useful like a chip-specific patch [often happens 
with on-mobo chips] or even a north/south-bridge-specific fixup.
