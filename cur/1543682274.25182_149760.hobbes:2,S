Ok. Sounds good. In fact, it's something I've wanted for a while, since 
it's also potentially the solution to performance-critical things like 
virtual filesystems based on revision control logic etc (traditionally 
done with fake NFS servers).
I did a very very quick scan, and didn't see anything that raised my 
hackles. But it's late in the 2.6.x game, and as a result I'm not going to 
apply it until I get a lot of feedback from actual users too.
