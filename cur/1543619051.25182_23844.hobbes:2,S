Looks good. 
In fact, this looks a _lot_ more palatable than the "scalable page
cache" approach with the hashed locks.
Can you post the numbers on scalability (I can see the locking
improvement, but if you have numbers I'd be even happier) and any
benchmarks you have?
The only real complaint I have is that I'd rather see "radix_root" than
"rat_root". Maybe it is just me, but the latter makes me wonder about
the sex-lives of small furry mammals. Which is not what I really want to
be thinking about.
It looks straigthforward enough, so if you feel it is stable (and
cleaned up), I'd suggest just submitting it for real.
