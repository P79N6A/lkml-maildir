I have USB host controllers and HID compiled in due to the keyboard.
irq 10: nobody cared!

Disabling IRQ #10
This occured while I was at lunch (not touching the computer).  This happened
at 12:38 (I left for lunch at 11:50).
I don't have this problem on 2.4.26, but I did not compile it into the kernel.
(Actually, that was something I forgot to do).
Another thing I'm having problems with is the fact this keyboard has extra
keys which work under 2.4, but not 2.6.  Appears that the keycode table is
missing 16 sets at the end which correspond to 6 of those keys.  I think I
can fix this myself.
Not sure if this helps or not:
lspci -v on the usb controllers:
