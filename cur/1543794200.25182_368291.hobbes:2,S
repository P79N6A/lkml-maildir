This should be noted in the patch description not in the announcement.

However your flush request can fail on the sector _completely_
unrelated to the barrier request so in this case old code worked
differently.  Anyway I'm fine with this change (previous logic was
too complicated).

The consequence could be increased number of bugreports about
failed IDE commands which wasn't the case with !drive->wcache check
in place - please leave as it was.

Are you sure?  I think that only calling del_gendisk() assures you
that there won't be outstanding fs requests?
I have also noticed bug in ide_disk_remove() - ide_cacheflush_p()
should be called after del_gendisk() - I will fix it later.
BTW Nowadays you can dynamically dettach/attach driver from/to
device using sysfs interface.
