There's a known bug in dd where it incorrectly attempts to truncate
the output file even though it's a block device. In kernels older
than 2.4.0-test10 or so it got away with this, but now the kernel
correctly returns an error.
Use the 'conv=notrunc' option to dd to fix this, i.e.
    dd if=rootfs.gz of=/dev/fd0 bs=1k conv=notrunc seek=XXX
