I have yet to see this, unless a something else on the system is conflicting
with a resource that the ne2000 wants.  Actually its Win95 that I have seen
hang slightly upon boot up using ne2000, for some reason it takes it a
couple of minutes to fully initialize its network occasionally with some
ne2000 cards.  However, I have seen those same adapters work flawlessly
under linux.
