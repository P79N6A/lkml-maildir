Hrm, I think we may be talking about different things.  Are you thinking 
that the driver I posted allows you to do PCI pass-through over virtio?  
That's not what it is.
The driver I posted is a virtio implementation that uses a PCI device.  
This lets you use virtio-blk and virtio-net under KVM.  The alternative 
to this virtio PCI device would be a virtio transport built with 
hypercalls like lguest has.  I choose a PCI device because it ensured 
that each virtio device showed up like a normal PCI device.
Am I misunderstanding what you're asking about?
Regards,
Anthony Liguori
