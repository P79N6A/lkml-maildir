I looked at it yesterday.  The problem is, it loses the information about *how*
a page is used: pagecache lookup via readahead has different implications than
actual usage.  The other thing that looks a little problematic, which Rik also
pointed out, is the potential long lag before the inactive page is detected.
A lot of IO can take place in this time, filling up the active list with pages
that we could have evicted much earlier.
