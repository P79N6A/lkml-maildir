I've found the problem. It appears to be in lockdep. struct lock_class has a 
const char *name field which points to a statically allocated string that 
comes from the code which uses the lock. If that code/string is in a module 
and gets unloaded, the pointer in |name| is no longer valid. Next time this 
field is dereferenced (count_matching_names, in this case), we crash.
The following patch fixes the issue but there's probably a better way.
