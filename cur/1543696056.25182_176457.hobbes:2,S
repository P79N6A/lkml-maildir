Here on thinkpad with ATI 7500 I have APM suspend/resume working
in -test9 with the following workaround:
$ more /etc/apm/event.d/video
#!/bin/sh
case "$1" in
suspend)
         /bin/fgconsole > /var/tmp/fgconsole.save
         /usr/bin/chvt 1
         ;;
resume)
         /usr/bin/chvt `cat /var/tmp/fgconsole.save`
         ;;
