Looks to me like the problem I had in Febuary, see the thread
"epic100 in current -ac kernels" at 
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg28523.html
After I had upgraded my BIOS, the problems were gone and I stopped
looking into it. The DMA mapping code first introduced in 2.4.0-ac2
(smallest diff here) originally triggered the bug, which had different
symptoms depending on the configuration of the chipset.
Note that I have a VIA VT8363 (KT133) chipset while this is a VT82C595 
(VP2) chipset, so it is appearantly not limited to one very specific 
configuration.
