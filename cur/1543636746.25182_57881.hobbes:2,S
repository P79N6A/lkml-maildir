That is nothing like safe enough. The current approach it takes is IMHO
backwards. The probing stuff isnt safe. Any laptop could have this kind
of stuff lurking.
I would much rather see DMI tables used - both the DMI entry that is
meant for this and board id matches. That way it would only activate on
systems that it is known to be safe on. It would also require no user
configuration, which again could lead to problems.
We have a DMI parser, and we can encourage vendors (or suicidal users)
to contribute table entries.
