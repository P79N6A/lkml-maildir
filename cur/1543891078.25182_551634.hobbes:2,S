That is true, the sync write also has side effects at the drive side
since it may have a varied cost depending on the workload (eg what
already resides in the cache when it is issued), unless FUA is active.
That is also true for the barrier of course, but only for previously
submitted IO as we don't reorder.
I'm not saying that a SYNC write wont be potentially useful, just that
it's definitely not free even outside of the write itself.
