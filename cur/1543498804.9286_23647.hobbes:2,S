I get almost the same thing with kernel 2.2.7-2.2.9 on my system.
Boots until the second IDE controller and then hangs.
Kernel 2.2.5ac7 and all previous work just fine.
My system is a Micronics W6-Li with 2 Pentium Pro CPUs and a DPT
SCSI controller.  The only thing on IDE is a CD-ROM and a Zip drive.
The only thing different is the kernel: there have been no hardware
changes on my system.
Besides Bill, I have read messages from two others that have boot
trouble with the later 2.2 kernels.  Seems serious enough for
someone to take a look.
Unfortunately, I can't get any information from the magic keys.
I just get a hard freeze after ide0's line is printed to the screen.
I can't imagine this problem would be fixed by Andre's patches
since I don't use IDE drives to boot up.  My SCSI controller is my
boot controller and this isn't a problem from 2.0 to 2.2, it's just
between minor revisions of 2.2.
I'm not really sure how to further probe this problem because I
can't get anything but a quick freeze at boot.  I've tried turning
off the secondary IDE controller in BIOS but that had no effect.
