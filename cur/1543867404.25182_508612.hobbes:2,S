Let me spell it out, since you appear to have completely missed my point.
At the moment, SKIP_TO_NEXT_ON_STOP is specified to jump a "jump a full
syslet_uatom number of bytes".
If we end up with a system call being added which requires more than
the currently allowed number of arguments (and it _has_ happened before)
then either those syscalls are not accessible to syslets, or you need
to increase the arg_ptr array.
That makes syslet_uatom larger.
If syslet_uatom is larger, SKIP_TO_NEXT_ON_STOP increments the syslet_uatom
pointer by a greater number of bytes.
If we're running a set of userspace syslets built for an older kernel on
such a newer kernel, that is an incompatible change which will break.

Okay - I guess the userspace library approach is fine, but it needs
to be documented that applications which build syslets directly are
going to be non-portable.
