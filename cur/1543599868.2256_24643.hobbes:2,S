We already have good experience with it. Feel free to try something
else, the more the better.
Nevertheless you have to define the bug and its context first. The
problem with defining some fancy min macro is you have too little
information about the context, so you can mostly only restrict the use
of min, possibly preventing legal uses of it (signed/unsigned compare is
AFAIK the only exception).
