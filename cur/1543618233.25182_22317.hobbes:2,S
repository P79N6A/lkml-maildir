Here's my understanding. If you are using hardware RAID you can do
anything your controller supports, and it looks like a single drive to the
CPU. But if you are looking for reliable boot, you need to use /boot as a
RAID-1 partition on the first two drives, and make that partition the
active partition (that may not be needed with your BIOS).
This is because if the first disk fails totally, the 2nd will be used to
boot. You also should use an initrd image to be sure all you need to get
up is on that small mirrored partition. After that your other partitions
can be whatever pleases you.

It should outperform most other RAID configs under heavy load, but in most
cases RAID-5 is fine for system which don't need the absolute highest
performance. Note that the extra writes are queued and there are no extra
reads unless it is in recovery mode. RAID-1 can be faster, because there
are two copies of the data, if one drive is busy the other can be used. I
haven't checked to see that software RAID does that correctly and gets the
benefit.
