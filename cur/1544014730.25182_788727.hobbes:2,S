Hello :)
Sorry it took me so long to reply - I built a kernel based on
vanilla-2.6.28 and applied patches with quilt to .DATE=2009-01-05-12-50.
That worked well, except that when booted, the xfs driver corrupts each
time my MUAs (evolution) configuration :(
But not your problem... the LED-scheduling-problem went away (no more
blinking, on more kernel-BUG and I get:
[   31.822317] lis3lv02d: laptop model unknown, using default axes
configuration
[   31.822367] Registered led device: hp:red:hddprotect
[   32.059496] input: ST LIS3LV02DL Accelerometer
as /devices/platform/lis3lv02d/input/input8
[   32.081954] lis3lv02d driver loaded.
$ lsmod | egrep 'lis3lv02d|hp_accel'
hp_accel                6656  0 
led_class               3908  2 iwl3945,hp_accel
lis3lv02d               5956  1 hp_accel

/sys/bus/platform/devices/lis3lv02d
/sys/bus/acpi/drivers/lis3lv02d
/sys/module/lis3lv02d
/sys/module/hp_accel
I was shortly confused, because CONFIG_LEDS_HP_DISK went away and got
integrated into CONFIG_SENSORS_LIS3LV02D with
lis3lv02d-merge-with-leds-hp-disk.patch :)
Bye,
Daniel
