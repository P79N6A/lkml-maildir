Someone finally noticed that my program that uses ptrace only works on i386..
and, by the looks of it, there is no portable way to refer to the
registers of a
user_regs_struct when inspecting a system call.
I will probably end up making a header file for each architecture that
defines where
in the user_regs_struct things like the syscall number, the return
value and the first 3 parameters are..
has anyone done this already?  or can otherwise save me a lot of time?
Thanks,
Trent
