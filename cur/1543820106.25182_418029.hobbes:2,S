The subadmin gets CAP_SYS_ADMIN. This is because capable() is often done before
the LSM callout, e.g. sys_sethostname(). Even when capable() is after an LSM
call, the process needs a certain capability or the syscall/function will
return failure to userspace. The best solution I can think of is that capable()
disappears entirely from functions and that an LSM function does it all then.

Yes, but at least it returns permission denied in the default case :)
Best would probably if the caller uses a fixed string rather than __FUNCTION__
from the expanded capable_x() macro. Or an enum value...
enum {
	HK_SETHOSTNAME,
};

static bool mt_file_alloc_override(int cur, int max) {
    /* Called when the maximum number of files is open. Only superadmins may
    override this. Return >0 for success. */
    return is_any_superadm(current->euid, current->egid);
}
I see what you mean - cur and max are unused. However, if I was to call to a
seconday module from within this function (which is not really implemented), I
would suddenly need cur and max again. I do think that the parameters have a
reason to be there - a user might wish to enforce this sort:
    return is_any_superadm(...) ||
           (is_any_subadm(...) && (max <= 2048))
E.g. "allow some more" for subadms. Multiadmin is currently extremely tailored
to one specific (call it the default :-) use case.

Exactly (like above with capable(), DAC shares the same 'positional' problem).
In fact, after some thought I could come to the conclusion that the POSIX
CAPability framework is more a hindrance for this sort of LSM, since it's
mostly UID/GID-based. We only raise capabilities so the rest of the kernel
plays fine with us.
