hm, the syslog you sent suggests that it's the 2.6.10-rc1-mm3-RT-V0.7.24
kernel that crashed:
 Nov 11 12:39:46 lambda kernel: EFLAGS: 00010083   (2.6.10-rc1-mm3-RT-V0.7.24)
not -V0.7.26-3. The particular rmmod crash you got:
 Nov 11 12:39:46 lambda kernel:  [<c013b72c>] kmem_cache_free+0x4a/0xc7 (8)
 Nov 11 12:39:46 lambda kernel:  [kobject_cleanup+142/144] kobject_cleanup+0x8e/0x90 (12)
 Nov 11 12:39:46 lambda kernel:  [<c01b0f08>] kobject_cleanup+0x8e/0x90 (12)
seems to be quite related to one of the fixes that -V0.7.25 includes:
 - added upstream fix for kobject related crash, pointed out by Shane
   Shrybman.
so ... unless you got similar crashes with -V0.7.25 or later kernels
(but no syslog traces), please try the latest one (-V0.7.26-4), does
that one crash in rmmod too?
