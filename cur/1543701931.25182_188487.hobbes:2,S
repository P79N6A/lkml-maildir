Andi, you must not modify sg->length in any way shape or form.
The following is legal:
	pci_map_sg(..&sg);
	pci_unmap_sg(...&sg);
	pci_map_sg(..&sg);
If you must modify the length field for DMA, you must have a seperate
dma_length member of the scatterlist structure on your platform, see what
sparc64 does here.
If the documentation states this wrongly, it's a doc bug.
