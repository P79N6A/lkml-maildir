Easy to understand: you're wrong, that's all 8).  It makes perfect
sense for the master thread to close the socket every thread is
waiting on, they all wake up, get -EBADF whether they be in read(),
poll(), etc.  They then shut down.  Neat, huh?

No, Solaris is more programmer-friendly here.  That doesn't mean Linux
is wrong, just that the above claim is dubious.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
