We need it.  It doesn't make sense for every device driver
to register a reboot notifier.  When especially as they
have to run the same code when they are modular and are
removed.
Why would you not want to do that?

Because most device drivers don't implement a reboot notifier?
And they almost certainly need it.

Error please try again.  It is just they don't cause major problems
on reboot so no one notices the problems.
