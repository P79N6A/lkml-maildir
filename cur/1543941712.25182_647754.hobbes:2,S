if a new drivers is originally written for Linux, then you are breaking
the GPL. There is no other way to name this. Using EXPORT_SYMBOL or
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL make no difference here. You driver was meant to be
running as Linux kernel module and thus it is derivative work. While
there is a gray area, but this case has always been pretty clear.

What are you arguing here. It makes no difference if it is technical or
not. The EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL gives you a clear hint that when using this
symbol, you have to obey to the GPL. Even the EXPORT_SYMBOL is protected
by the same GPL license. And thus both has the same binding power to be
used from GPL modules only.
At this point I would strongly advise to talk to lawyer since you are
obvious missing the point here.

First of all we are talking about kernel modules here. Not the
userspace. So stop this FUD.

In userspace, yes, the kernel would "run" proprietary code fully legally
without any problem. As a kernel module, the only safe answer is no. And
in case of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, it is pretty clear. You would obviously
violate the license.
