Excellent. Thanks. Preliminary testing works as expected (ie: deadlocks
don't occur, xattrs/<dir> is removed when owning file is deleted)
I've integrated the changes into my patch set. With those issues
addressed, would you feel these would be appropriate for inclusion? I
suspect you may have gotten questions as many interested parties in this
feature working as I have.
