Do we really want to design for this though?
Being able to look up the parent directory is explicitly encoded in
all revisions of the NFS protocol. In NFSv2/v3 the names '.' and '..' 
have a clearly defined meaning, whereas in NFSv4 you are required to
support LOOKUPP.
I can't speculate about the needs of other networked filesystems which
may want to use this handle interface, but as far NFS is concerned we
are not interested in considering such special cases.
Cheers,
