	Fix alpha compile from Jeff.
	(recommended)
Only in 2.4.6pre5aa1: 00_bh-async-1
	Patch to Stefan.Bader@de.ibm.com to allow lowlevel layer
	to override bh->b_end_io callback without breaking the
	async I/O.
	(nice to have)

Only in 2.4.6pre5aa1: 00_ksoftirqd-7_ppc-2
	Dropped a comment (no code change). ('and' is really needed
	because lwz doesn't update the equal bit state of the cpu)

In the 40_experimental there's the latest blkdev in pagecache and it has
to be applied after all the other patches. Issue to solve in the
blkdev-pagecache-3 patch are:
-	fix ramdisk: lookup on pagecache and pin blkdev address space
	while the ramdisk stays allocated
-	I/O granularity is fixed to 4k, this can be easily decreased with
	a recompile, but I'm wondering if we should make the granularity
	dynamic somehow to avoid the partial write to do too many
	read-modify-write cycles
-	Currently the pagecache assumes the end of the device is aligned
	for excess on the next 4k (in genereal BUFFERED_BLOCKSIZE)
	boundary to be sure we can read and write all bytes of the disk.
	(see buffered_blk_size) I don't expect problems but blkdev layer
	must be able to cope with it.
I'm running this patch on all my systems and I didn't had problems yet
(though you cannot expect to get ramdisk and in turn initrd working
[ramfs works fine of course]). As said in a earlier email you can do
rawio now by simply openeing the blkdev with O_DIRECT (however you get
the BUFFERED_BLOCKSIZE granularity for it too, instead of the
hardblocksize granularity of the /dev/raw rawio, but this also means you
pay less cycles for bulding a flood of 512 bytes large bh) and mmap
private and shared on the blkdev works like with files in the fs.
