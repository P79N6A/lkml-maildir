A common case is that you only want to use some of all your devices of
a certain model. (My view may be strongly influenced by the s390
perspective, where we only have a quite limited amount of different
models and device drivers. In the highly diverse PC world, module
load/unload may indeed be the better way, since it doesn't require
additional work.)

It might. (s390 doesn't currently have power management.)
