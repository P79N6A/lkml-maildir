So really it's just the debug code which is being misleading?  hm.
Couldn't you set some magical global ACPI flag:
acpi_super_early_init()
{
	acpi_in_super_early_init = 1;
	do_stuff();
	acpi_in_super_early_init = 0;
}
And test that flag in acpi_os_wait_semaphore()?
It's a bit grubby, but so is the problem.
We do have this `system_running' flags in init/main.c which perhaps should be
fleshed out into a more fine-grained way of communicating the kernel's
start/run/stop state.
