Subject: [PATCH] Fix SH4 DMAC API
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch fixes the DMA cascade by masking the correct bits.
Tested and working with Dreamcast PVR2 DMA. With this patch applied
the existing mainline code in arch/sh/drivers/dma/dma-sh.c works,
whereas before I was patching that to get round this problem.
