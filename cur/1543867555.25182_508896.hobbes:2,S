I agree, that's really what should happen. We solve this by marking modules as 
supported, partner supported, or unsupported, but in an "insecure" way, so 
partners and users could try to fake the support status of a module and/or 
remove status flags from Oopses, and cryptography wouldn't save us. We could 
try to sign Oopses which I guess you guys are doing. This whole issue hasn't 
been a serious problem in the past though, and we generally try to trust 
users not to play games on us.
In the end, it all seems to boils down to a difference in philosophy.
Thanks,
Andreas
