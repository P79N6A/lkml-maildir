It's easier if you skip the ones by Hans and their immediate followups :)
(Nothing personal, it's that Hans is mostly justifying reiser4's
behaviour, and the posts you really need to read aren't about reiser4).

Somewhere deep in that thread is a discussion between Al Viro and
Linus on it.

The new flag would indicate more than that: These mounts should be
detachable in the sense that deleting the file is possible, and
perhaps renamable/linkable too.  That's the stuff Al Viro discusses in
some detail in the big thread.
Ideally we'd like automounting, a bit like the Hurd's translators.
Attached to files (using an xattr or something, and executed with the
uid/gid of the file owner), and also per-user "pattern->action"
options for matching files with a certain type (e.g. tgz/zip/deb/rpm/xml).
But that can be added much later, as it's an orthogonal feature.
