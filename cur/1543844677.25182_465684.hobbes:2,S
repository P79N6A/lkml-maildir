Just a data point, FWIW; I've made no systematic effort to find regressions.
We've been running Thomas's (pre-dynticks) 2.6.16-hrt patchset (and
HZ=1000) without issue as part of my standard kernel build on x86 and
x86_64 UP/SMP production hosts -- workstations, PostgreSQL (and other)
servers, and routers --- since I experienced latency/ntp problems with
an unpatched kernel using sata_nv on Tyan 2895 Nvidia CK804-chipset mobo
back in March 2006.  I've also been running the (originally x86-only)
2.6.17-dynticks patch on a Tyan Athlon SMP workstation mobo, and occasionally
on my laptop, so far without issue.
I originally chose Thomas's -hrt variant of John Stultz's timekeeping
patchset because it had known-working x86_64 support ...
We're not doing anything exotic (such as audio, packet capture,
or serving thousands of connections) that might stress the timer or
clock system much, but the x86 routers have GigE traffic and the
x86_64 PostgreSQL servers are often heavily loaded.
