So my introducing SCHED_IDLE we add another case where users can
break their code in seemly strange ways?
I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but I don't see how it is a good
thing either.

I still not convinced -- what problem does SCHED_IDLE solve? Why
can't we just extended the range of acceptable process priorities as
other OSs (eg. Solaris) have done?
Sure -- its not quite the same thing, but in reality is the 1% or so
different you might see with rc5crack or whatever going to really
matter all that much?
