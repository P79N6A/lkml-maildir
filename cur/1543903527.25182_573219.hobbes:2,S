I enabled the MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME option and the problems I was seeing was
"fixed". I think having this option is a bad idea (in its current form)
as it doesn't actually stop filesystem corruption.
With the option disabled, if a filesystem is mounted when you suspend my
tests show the filesystem is corrupted. At least if the option is
enabled, the filesystem is only corrupted if you remove the card whilst
suspended which is more preferable.
I guess the solution would be to abort the suspend if mounted systems
were detected and the option was disabled? Alternatively the option
could be "auto" enabled only for mounted systems maybe with a printk
warning?
Of course the best solution would be to have filesystems support
suspend/resume requests since other subsystems like pcmcia also suffer
this problem and would benefit from this but I accept that teaching
filesystems this is more difficult.
