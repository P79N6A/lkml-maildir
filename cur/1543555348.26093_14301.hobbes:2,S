The disk drivers are not, and they normally see merged runs of blocks so they
will see big chunks rather than 1K then 1K then 1K etc.

I see higher performance with 4K block sizes. I should see higher latency too
but have never been able to measure it. Maybe it depends on the file system.
It certainly depends on the nature of requests
