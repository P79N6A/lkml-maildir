Yes.  In fact, that's how I got the idea.  But the reasoning is
backward, it's not "Let's make a filesystem that uses full gc rather
than limited reference counting", it's "Let's make a filesystem where
we can have circular structures and other Nasty Things - then of
course we will need a gc on that".

Yes.  And c/.. is not . but rather c/d/a (actually, ".." is pretty
meaningless in a gcfs).

I've had a look at the Hurd, and they have the same kind of problems:
Unix tools (even when made by GNU) will assume Unix filesystem
semantics, and these are not necessarily verified under the Hurd.
When you run 'find' on a user's directory under the Hurd, you are in
the same situation as running a web crawler on a person's site: they
decide what you will see under that directory/site, and you have no
guarantee that what you will see will obey *any* kind of filesystem
semantics, or finiteness conditions
(see 
http://www.eleves.ens.fr:8080/cgi-bin/infinity/
 for example).

Actually, it's worse than that: a/ has disappeared from c/d/ because
you just moved it.  So now it looks like this: c/ contains d/ and a/,
c/d/ is empty, and c/a/ contains b/ which points back to c/

It's more like the other way around: Unix filesystems have very rigid
semantics, which we have gotten accustomed to, but they are by no
means necessary.  The Web of URL's has much (much!) looser semantics,
for example.

Ah, but that is your mistake: why would it get 'moved' into your
directory.  If it does, that implies that sam is no longer using it.
Otherwise she would have kept a link to it.  I.e. the 'shared'
directory would have been hardlinked in yours, not moved in yours.
A 'move' operation is almost equivalent to link-and-remove, i.e. "mv
foo some/place/" (no matter whether "foo" is a file or a directory) is
almost the same as "ln foo some/place/; rm(dir)? foo" (the 'almost'
part comes from the fact that, if foo is a directory, in the first
case foo/.. will point to some/place/ whereas in the second case it
will still point to .).  So you must think of the move as two
operations: first I decide I am interested in sam's 'shared' directory
(note taht I do not need her permission to make that link), then sam
decides that she does not want it any more.

It *is* great.  Because that is exactly the kind of fs semantics we
*want*: if I am interested in an object, I can make a hard link to
that object, and it will remain living so long as I do not remove the
link, or, rather, so long as there are live links to that object.
This is already the semantics we have for files (replace the "'shared'
directory" by the "'shared' file" throughout in your discussion), and
I am just proposing to extend it to directories.

It really does.  To be honest, I think it is completely useless, but
it certainly sounds cool.  You have made that all the more obvious.

IMHO, the VFS should never have to worry about that sort of things.
It only cares about two things: inodes, which are real references to
objects (resources) in the filesystem, and dentries which name a way
of getting there.  It is not supposed to know anything about the state
of the filesystem, and in fact that state can change all the time.
But I do not know whether my Humble Opinion actually reflects the way
the VFS is organized in Linux.  :-(

I was thinking of storing the links on disk rather than in memory.
The disadvantage is that the fs is more easily subject to corruption.
The advantage is that the mount operation is much easier (the links to
not have to be all reconstructed).  On disk, they could be either
within each block, or in a large table of blocks at the beginning of
the filesystem.
There's still much to be thought about.
Happy hacking,
