This has been resolved; Petr suggested I make sure the PCI card is snug, and it wasn't.
The card reported its proper Vendor ID of 1095 after I reinstalled it.
Eventually I discovered you need to install this card in a Windows machine and get it working
with at least 1 drive connected for the card to become accessible.  I'm assuming the Windows driver
does some sort of initialization on the card.  After this, Linux detects it perfectly:
SiI680: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:08.0
SiI680: chipset revision 2
SiI680: BASE CLOCK == 133
SiI680: 100% native mode on irq 10
    ide2: MMIO-DMA , BIOS settings: hde:pio, hdf:pio
    ide3: MMIO-DMA , BIOS settings: hdg:pio, hdh:pio
hde: WDC WD136AA, ATA DISK drive
ide2 at 0xd1816c80-0xd1816c87,0xd1816c8a on irq 10
...
hde: max request size: 64KiB
hde: 26564832 sectors (13601 MB) w/2048KiB Cache, CHS=26354/16/63, UDMA(66)
 hde: hde1 hde2 hde3 < hde5 hde6 hde7 >
Thanks again
