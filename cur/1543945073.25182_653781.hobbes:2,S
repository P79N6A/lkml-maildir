The sound driver doesn't fail because two different drivers have
requested the same region; it fails because PNP told us a region
exists, and the sound region crosses the edge of the PNP region.

I thought you were suggesting here that the PNP system driver would
do an insert_resource(), and it would fail if it clashed with the
PCI resource.
Can you be more explicit about how you think I should fix this?
