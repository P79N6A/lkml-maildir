ONLY in the case where you would have otherwise blown up at boot.
Lets face it; blowing up if the admin does "lspci -vvvxxx" with a clear 
message in dmesg about which device was enabled last is BY FAR preferable 
over just plain not booting.
In all cases where the kernel knows MMCONFIG is broken, no amount of pci_enable_ext_config()
(from drivers or sysfs) will enable MMCONFIG.

It's containing them not so much covering. To the point that it becomes diagnosable
and that users have working systems by default.
