And which place would that be?  Concrete example: we have 4 links to the
same inode in /bin - /bin/gzip, /bin/gunzip, /bin/zcat and /bin/uncompress.
What should happen upon attempts to look at the metadata of /bin/gzip and
/bin/gunzip simultaneously from completely unrelated processes?  Where
can these guys be found and in case if you say "whoever looks first wins,
another guy gets -EBUSY or some other error" keep in mind that user-triggerable
DoS tend to make sysadmins quite unhappy.

Uhh...  Hans, think for a second - any algorithm would have to be able to
tell if adding an edge to graph would create a loop.  Consider the following
graph: take two full binary trees of depth N, order their leaves, revert the
edges in one of them and for each leaf of the first tree add an edge leading
to corresponding leaf of the second one.  (IOW, for N=2 you'll get 14 nodes
with the following edges: A->A0, A->A1, A0->A00, A0->A01, A1->A10, A1->A11,
A00->B00, A01->B01, A10->B10, A11->B11, B00->B0, B01->B0, B10->B1, B11->B1,
B0->B, B1->B).  Now, give that tree to your algorithm and start asking if
adding an edge between given two nodes would add a loop.  You'll get
exponential time complexity.  Moreover, the number of nodes you would have
to examine is also exponential.
Note that guy specifically mentioned that his filesystem had been in-core
one.  With disk-based fs you'll either have to keep the entire graph
in-core *or* you will have to walk the damn thing pulling it from disk.
And you need an exclusion against graph modifications while you are looking
through it.  Have fun...

The word "closure" has more than enough meanings, so I am afraid that
unless you care to specify what exactly you are talking about it will
remain above my head - I am not a telepath.
