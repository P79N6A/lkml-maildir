One problem with input_sync is that the panel get's too fast, and double
click is experienced quite often, maybe some threshold is needed for low
values in Z-direction?
I'm probably doing something wrong here since I experience easy
doubleclicks when I just lightly touch the screen.

Thanks, I've adopted to those now, havn't had time to test with the
panel today, but my guess is that this dosn't make a big deal.

Done.

Done.

Sorry, the panel is a fixed size, and it gives out coordinates from 0 ->
4095 in both X- and Y-direction. In Z-direction (pressure strength) it
goes from 0 to 255.
Or did you want the size of the screen? Meaning you want to know if it's
a 15", 17" and so on?
