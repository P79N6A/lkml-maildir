Nice try :) Okay then, you remove the freezer, try hibernating, then get back 
to me after you've fixed your filesystem because some process that wasn't 
frozen started writing things after the atomic copy (making the on disk 
filesystem inconsistent with the snapshot).
As Pavel rightly said, you can get rid of the freezer, but you're only going 
to have to implement another one that does the essentially the same thing, 
even if it is at some other level.

(Leaving the rest of the message intact so we don't have to fragment the 
discussion into a million subthreads).
