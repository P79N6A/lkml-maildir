Should the symbol_put be done at all?  When I wrote the code this is based
on, it would check if FUNCTION failed or not.  If it failed, the symbol was
put.  But if it worked, then one was returned a handle into FUNCTION's
module, and so the symbol was not put.  If it was, the module's refcount
would be zero but the caller would have a handle into the module.
So if FUNCTION does anything that creates references to the module, and it
doesn't inc it's own refcount, then the symbol_put shouldn't be done.
