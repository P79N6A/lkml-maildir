I think this can be useful for more than just a cool toy.  I think that the
main thing that this discusion has shown is no OOM killer will please 100% of
the people 100% of the time.  I think we should try and have a good generic
OOM killer that kills the right process most of the time.  People can impliment
(and submit) different-style OOM killers as needed.  Or at least get 'em on
freshmeat. :)
