This is completely orthogonal to the `Two Trees' (cf. Tolkien ;->)
issue!
We can (and probably should) make all drivers allocate their resources at
init time.  We also should make them receive data from the bus scan so
they won't do this allocation themselves but instead receive it from
outside (if possible).  The other tree is neccessary only so that the scan
itself can be done in a sane fashion.
One sane (and backward-compatible) interface for this may be quite similar
to David's current PCMCIA support.  Drivers which know about the new
system don't initialize any hardware state in their init function, but
only global driver data; they then call register_driver().  The bus
drivers then allocate the (normal) resource nodes for the device and
invoke the thus-registered hardware initialization function (once per
physical device that should be handled by the driver).  At the end of all
this, the resource tree is fully populated.
Drivers which aren't updated will still try to use the resource manager as
a locking facility, but they'll work; they just won't properly support PnP
or hotplug.
And, since we _anyway_ need such a `register_driver' (or equivalent) for
supporting hotplug _at_all_, I believe it's a definite win.

It can be both at the same time.
