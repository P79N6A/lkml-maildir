Erk, that's beyond ugly, into actual evil.
To make this general you need to find the last N 1-element chains (but SCSI 
doesn't do this of course).  Oh the horror...
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the sg_ring ata patches were 
straightforward, and indescribably beautiful if compared to this!
Thanks,
