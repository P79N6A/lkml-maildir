Actually, a lot of embedded applications like initramfs because it saves 
memory (a ram block device, a filesystem driver, and filesystem overhead.)  
Don't use embedded applications as a reason _not_ to do this!
BusyBox has had explicit support for initramfs (switch_root) for several 
versions now.  I pestered HPA about building a subset of BusyBox against 
klibc (and cross-compiling klibc for non-x86 platforms) at the Consumer 
Electronics Linux Forum, but haven't had time to follow up yet.
