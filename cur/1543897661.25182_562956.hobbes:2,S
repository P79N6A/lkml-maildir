Not a problem, thanks for taking a look...

True, it isn't quite crypto code, but I gravitated to this location because:
1/ the models are similar, both are general purpose apis with a driver component
2/ there are already some algorithms in the crypto layer that are not
strictly cryptographic like crc32c, and other checksums
3/ having the code under that directory is a reminder to consider
closer integration when adding support for more complex algorithms
like raid6 p+q (at what point does a 'dma-offload' engine become a
'crypto' engine?  at some point they converge)
The hope is that other subsystems beyond md could benefit from offload
engines.  For example, the crc32c calculations in btrfs might be a
good candidate, and kcopyd integration has crossed my mind.
