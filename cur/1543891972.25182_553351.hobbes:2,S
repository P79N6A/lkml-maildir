Interestingly it seems to be only in -mm.

I have a patch for a tsc-based clock, but that's a little orthogonal: I
actually need to override sched_clock.
(I'd really like to do stolen time and everything, but looking at Xen
it's a lot of code to do right, and noone's asked for it yet).
This time for sure!

In recent -mm kernels, the TSC capability cannot be disabled,
resulting in a divide by zero error in the normal sched_clock.
The correct fix is to have a special lguest sched_clock
implementation: this is as simple as it gets.
