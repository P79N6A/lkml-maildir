Just FYI,
before these "#ifdef" fixes it was treated as OFF_BOARD unless
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE is set. (now it's inverted)
And my point is that it does not matter how physically this controller
installed - onboard or offboard. Idea is that we should have control
which controller should be treated as "primary" (ide0/1) and which as
"secondary" (ide2/3). I don't see/know how we can do it unless we mark
one of controllers ON_BOARD and another OFF_BOARD and play with
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_OFFBOARD.
And also I don't believe that this is good idea to treat one of Promises so
differently.
