You said way back that it was only wget that did hog the andbith, 
right? Assuming that you speak to the same servers all the time (i.e. 
for both the wget and non-wget cases), how about playing with the tcp 
windows? If the send and receive machines are the same, any 
difference have to come from different tcp setups. Check what 
options, if any wget and others are setting. I bet announcing a large 
receive window can folld your upstream network (your ISP's queues) 
and make the rest of the tcp timer magics run on longer control 
loops, this making it respond to changes more sluggishly.
