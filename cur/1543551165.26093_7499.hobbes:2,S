   Ok, I'm on 2.2.18pre15 now, and using mkisofs and cdrecord directly.
I'm also using 'speed=2' on the cdrecord commandline.  If it's relevant,
this is using IDE-SCSI emulation.  Now, I've just managed to write 4 CDs
in a row on one bootup fine, but the 5th one bombed out nastily (as I
was writing the first version of this email, it must have been
watching).  I'm trying again with a:
	echo 1 >> /proc/sys/dev/cdrom/debug
Ah, it's just crapped out again, all be it twice as far in this time
(95MB in rather than 43MB).  Hmmmm, those first 4 burns mostly had big
gaps inbetween (1 and 2 had quite a gap, 2 to 3 was 12 hours and more, 3
and 4 were done right after each other).  I wonder if I simply have some
overheating problem in the drive.
   Anyways, some more data to add to the pile, hopefully it helps
someone track down the culprit.
thanks,
