Some time ago I compiled cdrdao 1.1.7 with support for this (iirc I
copied libscg from cdrecord)
I use it all the time with 2.6, works like a charm at 32x.
If you are brave enough you can use it (never trust binaries offered by
strange people :) especially don't run them as root. (I never burn cd's
as root, works just fine as a normal user as long as you have
write-permission for the blockdevice, but you loose the
realtime-priority of the process when running as non-root which might
matter if you have a slow or highly loaded system while burning)
