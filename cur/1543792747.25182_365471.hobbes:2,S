you're welcome
comparing our two emails, you can see that Rickard is much better used to 
this matter than myself, as his email is more condense but has the same 
information as mine. (see also my signature in this email)

well placed questions never hurt (some answers may, but that's another 
story :P )... and often other people find that they also wanted to know 
the answer but didn't dare to ask. 
greetings,
Damir
