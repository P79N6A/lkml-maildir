Well you can - its called SG_IO and that really does get the OS out of
the way. O_DIRECT gets crazy when you stop using it on devices directly
and use it on files
You do need some way to avoid the copy cost of caches and get data direct
to user space, it also needs to be a way that works without MMU tricks
because many of that need it are the embedded platforms.
