Right.  Didn't know that.  Whoa.  So in essence "char" is not a safe
type.

To be honest I didn't know that above.  That's why I'm always explicit.
 [btw my code builds in MSVC, BCC and ICC as well].
You don't need to know such details to be able to develop in C.  I'm
sure if you walked into [say] Redhat and gave an "on the spot C quiz"
about obscure rules they would fail.  You have to use some common sense
and apply the more relevant rules.  
Point is 0xDEADBEEFUL is just as simple to type and avoids any sort of
ambiguitity.  It means unsigned long.  No question about it.  No having
to refer to subsection 12 of paragraph 15 of section 23 of chapter 9 to
figure that out.
Why people are fighting over this is beyond me.  Fine, write it as
0xDEADBEEF see what the hell I care.  Honestly.  Open debate or what?  
And I don't need mr. Viro coming down off his mountain saying "oh you
fail it" because I don't know some obscure typing rule that I wouldn't
come accross because *** I AM NOT LAZY ***.  Hey mr. Viro what have you
contributed to the public domain lately?  Anything I can harp on in
public and abuse?  
Asshat.
