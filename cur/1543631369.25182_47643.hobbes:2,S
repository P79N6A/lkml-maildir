Anybody know where the website to get the patch to use pppd with kernel code 
went?
Apparently, 2.4.1 is still the latest version of ppp...
http://va.samba.org/ppp/
And it doesn't support pppoe.  It needs a patch, which used to be available 
from...
http://www.shoshin.uwaterloo.ca/~mostrows
Which is giving me a 404.
Any clues?
Might be possible to get the patch out of the google cache or the wayback 
machine, wo knows...
