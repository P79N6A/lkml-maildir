I suspect that many applications don't try to distinguish an open error 
beyond pass/fail. If the application actually tried to correct errors, 
like creating missing directories, it might, but if the error is going 
to be reported to the user and treated as fatal there's probably no 
logic to tell "can't do it" from "could if you asked the right way."
I always thought the difference between Linux and Windows was the "big 
brother" attitude. If someone wants to use O_DIRECT and tmpfs, and the 
system can allow it, why have code to block it because someone thinks 
they know better how the users should do things.
