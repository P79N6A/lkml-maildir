  Hi,
  the series of patches below implements automatic enabling of quotas on
remount read-write when filesystem with quotas enabled has previously been
remounted read-only (and thus quotas had to be disabled).
  The patches are split logically, but due to interface changes all four
patches need to be applied together or ext3, ext4 or reiserfs won't
compile.
[PATCH 1/4] quota: Quota core changes for quotaon on remount
[PATCH 2/4] ext3: Make ext3 handle quotaon on remount
[PATCH 3/4] ext4: Make ext4 handle quotaon on remount
[PATCH 4/4] reiserfs: Make reiserfs handle quotaon on remount
