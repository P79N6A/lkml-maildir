Damn. I really should refrain from posting to linux-kernel
just because I can't sleep :)

OK. Then I guess we want to implement this for mmap() and
swap I/O.

Now that you've pointed out the extra complexity involved, I
don't think it is worth it. Read-ahead and read-around should
be enough for most cases...

They might be separate, but I will argue that read-ahead
without clustering isn't worth much. Sure, you'll reduce
I/O latency of a single app when you get the data in
advance, but it will still break down when more processes
need access to the disk.
Clustering allows us to minimize the (absurdly expensive)
disk seeks so that we can increase filesystem throughput
to a level that's actually enough to service multiple apps
with minimal latency (if we read the data in advance).
Since these goals are so much alike, I don't think we
should make the (artificial) distinction you are making.
We should, IMHO, take the time to think up a simple
algorithm that approaches both goals without too much
hassles.
