Subject: [PATCH] missing pci_disable_device()

Hi,
As mentioned in Documentaion/pci.txt, pci device driver should call
pci_disable_device() to deallocate any IRQ resources, disable PCI
bus-mastering and etc. when it decides to stop using the device.
But there seems to be many drivers that don't use pci_disable_device()
properly so far.
The following patch changes pci_device_remove() to call
pci_disable_device() instead of the driver if the device has not been
disabled by the driver.
