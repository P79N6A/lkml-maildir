Yes, sounds reasonable.
The patch is needed, but MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE should be ripped out.
AFAIK sonypi and sony-laptop cannot coexist together. But sony-acpi
should be preferred. If someone needs sonypi, he needs to blacklist
sony-apci in modprobe.conf and load sonypi manually.
Shouldn't sony-acpi replace sonypi on longterm or at least addtional
"SNY6001" functionality be merged to sony-acpi? Having two drivers for
the same device is not a good idea.
Thanks,
