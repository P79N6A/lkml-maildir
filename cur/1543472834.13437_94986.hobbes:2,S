Because they're thinking like businesspeople, and business (in the U.S. at 
least) is a culture of blame.  "No support" really means "nobody I can 
threaten to sue if something goes wrong".
And yes, we all know that they've zero chance of suing Microsoft 
successfully if something goes wrong --- but that doesn't enter into the 
equation.  They need *someone* to point a finger at.
