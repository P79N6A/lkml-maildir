Sure, but my suggestion is just a way to make it possible without having
to maintain a lot of duplicated code. The point is simply that we'll be
getting rid of nopage from mainline sooner or later, and it will probably
be less painful for your out of tree stuff if you do it rather than me. Maybe.

It is pretty for mainline :) I appreciate you going out of your way to make
the code nicer rather than just make your life easier.
