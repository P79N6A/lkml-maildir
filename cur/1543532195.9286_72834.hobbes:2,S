   Also, perhaps devfs could mount on /dev even if /dev is missing?
Currently, you can get a nasty surprice when not being careful during a
transition to devfs: If you forget to mkdir /dev before rebooting, you get
"Unable to mount devfs on /dev: -36", followed by "unable to open initial
console", at which point you can safely forget about booting from that root
fs.
