When the kernel is booting it tries to locate the ipw-2.2 firmware
which cannot be found as the filesystems are yet to be mounted. The
firmware normally resides in the /lib directory. Its always advisable
to use drivers which require firmware loading as modules so that when
you try loading the module you have your file system already mounted.
