Just because it is old, it does not mean that it is bad....
It is the only interface that did not need to be modified since then.
The current driver interface is still 100% binary compatible to the
one I made in August 1986.

Note that Linux did not have a usable /dev/whatever based interface 10 years ago.
Also note that cdda2wav distinguishes between "OS native Audio ioctl calls" and
generic SCSI from checking the dev= parameter. For this reason using 
/dev/whateter is just wrong. Take it this way or you are a victim of you own 
decision to ignore the documentation of a program.
