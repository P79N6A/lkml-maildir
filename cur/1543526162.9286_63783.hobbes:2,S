Yep. I suggest to apply these two patches on top of pre5:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.3/2.3.46pre5/elevator-merge-typo-1.gz
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.3/2.3.46pre5/elevator-starvation-9.gz
(the first path is equivalente to your above patch, the second it's a
little fix for a debugging printk, that's the only difference left between
my current tree and Linus's pre5 tree)
Both patches are just in Linus's mailbox.
