I have a few changes and will post a updated version shortly.
There's also unfortunately still one outstanding bug (triggeredb y
some recent changes) on 32bit that makes the self test suite not pass
currently.

- WBINVD is a very nasty operation. I was talking to some CPU people
and they really recommended to get rid of it as far as possible.
Stopping the CPU for msecs is just wrong and there are apparently
even some theoretical live lock situations.
- It is not interruptible in earlier VT versions and messes up
real time in the hypervisor. Some people were doing KVM on rt 
kernels and had latency spikes from that.
I'll add that to the changelog.

Actually graphics drivers can do higher frequency allocation of WC
memory (with PAT) support.

Yes, that is why it took so long. But it's eventually needed
to make PAT actually useful for once.

Not sure what you mean here? If someone doesn't pass in the correct
area then not everything will be uncached in the first place. 
Using something as cached that should be uncached is usually
noticed because it tends to be quite slow or corrupt data.
I don't think you have thought that concern through.

change_page_attr() is used for more than just ioremap (e.g. a common
case is mapping memory into AGP apertures which still happens in
many graphics drivers). I also expect it will be used even more
in the future when PAT usage will become more wide spread.

It all depends on each other; I don't think any of the changes can
be easily reordered.
