erk.  That sounds right.
I don't think the max_index test matters much - if we ever
hit that index then something has gone horridly wrong, because
it's out-of-bounds for the tree height.  But whatever.

But your patch only fixes the symptoms of the bug.  You should
fix the real bug.  But to do that you'd need to find me, so this
will have to do for now.

Nope; this code is only in the mm crash-test-dummy tree at present.
And it's currently at the "wow, it worked first time" stage.  I need
to get down and write some special test code for it, and to run
fsx-linux.  Possibly fsx-linux has sufficient coverage.
