This helps - see below.

Why not include this info in kexec -h ?  Bet it would prevent a few
failure reports...

droping to init 1, then calling kexec -e (with the root= and the rest
of the appended parms) works and boots 2.5.51 just fine.  <grin>
Two more possible additions to the kexec command.  
1. kexec -q which returns rc=1 and types the pending selection and 
   its command/append string if one exists and returns rc=0 if nothing 
   is pending.  
2. kexec -c which clears any pending kernels.

Very possible since I did not do an init 0/1/6 before the kexec -e.  Usb
was probably being asked to do something very unexpected...

2.5.51 + fbcon(bk) + usb(bk) + kexec

Done.  I will see if I get this to reoccur and will send you debug
output.
