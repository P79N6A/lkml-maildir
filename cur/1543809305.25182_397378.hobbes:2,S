I shall and thank you. Given current constraints on my time I should have the 
patch I mentioned available in no more than two weeks.
If my patch breaks something on another OS, then please inform me so that I 
can modify the code and send you a fixed patch. After all, as I've said 
before, I don't have the access to the resources you do for testing.
