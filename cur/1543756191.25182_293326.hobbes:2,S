I recently posted an update to 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1786
 that shows the bug escalating on newer hardware, such that there is no user-accessable workaround.
It seem that where an MX-series mouse's cruise-control buttons are concerned, the mouse (by default) produces two events for each button press: The button itself, as well as a scroll event simulating a keyboard-style press-delay-repeat cycle on the scroll wheel axis/buttons.
Utilities such as logitech_applet (unmaintained afaict) seem to be able to change some settings. For example, on my MX1000 mouse it's able to disable the cruise-control scroll button simulation, which would allow me to use the buttons as ordinary mouse buttons. What I'd love to do is to be able to disable the button's native function and use *only* the cruise-control function, as the mouse was intended.
If such a hardware reconfiguration is not possible, perhaps it would be easier to leave the mouse in the default configuration, but filter one event or the other before it reaches userspace? Or is it more natural to filter out the mouse's scroll-simulation, and do a mapping & key-repeat simulation in userspace somewhere?
Please CC me in replies.
