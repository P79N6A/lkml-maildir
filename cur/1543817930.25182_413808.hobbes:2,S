Shouldn't be needed: Documentation/atomic_ops.txt specifies that any atomic_
which both modifies its atomic operand and returns something is to be a full
barrier before and after the operation.
This misuse occurs a few times in core code, which makes it a bit confusing.
However, I think it is nice to add a comment if these implicit barriers are
used, if the purpose is not really obvious.
