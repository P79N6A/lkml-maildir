Hello,
I need 200 to 500 32k buffers in my device driver,
which is a lodable kernel module.
get_free_pages failing to allocate these many buffers.
My requirement is the all these 32k buffers should be
contiguous physical memory and I need a minimum of 200
such buffers.
I'd like to know how to get get these many buffers
(physically contigous) for a loadable kernel module.
Have a nice time.
Regards
Arun
