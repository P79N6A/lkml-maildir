Ok, let's look  at the higher levels
We call vfs_rename (old_dir, old_dentry, new_dir, new_dentry), which
checks, wether old_dentry->d_inode is directory
If so it calls vfs_rename_dir, if not calls vfs_rename_other
In vfs_rename_dir checked if we can delete old_dentry (by means of may_delete), then if new_dentry->d_inode is present, check if we can delete it
But it is not checked, wether new_dentry->d_inode directory or not
I don't find this check in chain started from syscall and ends in ext2_rename
Correct me if I'm wrong.
Thanks in advance,
