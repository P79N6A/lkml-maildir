There is also a patch against 2.6.8-rc1-mm1. The naming scheme is a bit
confused at the moment :(
Anyway a lot more changes since I last announced a release. Memory manager
is working much better on bigger memory systems and highmem systems now.
If anyone knows of any meaningful pagecache intensive tests, let me know.
Better yet, try it and let me know where it performs worse than vanilla!
