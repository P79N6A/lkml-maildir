Hi everybody!
I got two old 8-bit ISA LANCE (AMD 7990) boards (what
company uses an SK logo?). I tried them with the lance driver
(from the SUSE 6 boot disk), which is unable to detect the boards
on all four adresses (0x300, 0x320, 0x340, 0x360)  the driver allows.
Does anybody use this driver with the old LANCE? Comments in the code
suggest that the the author doesn't. 
I would like to use these boards and would be willing to spend some
time to get them working, if anybody can help me and tell me how.
With best regards
Hartmut Niemann
