Hello Jeff,
I'd like to confirm that the patch in your email from 2005-12-11 does indeed 
work for my vt8251 on an K8M800 motherboard.
It didn't apply cleanly to 2.6.15; I had to fix two rejects, and then comment 
out the two lines with
	.host_stop =
and
	.check_err =
to make it compile.
I'd like to ask you if that could have negative effects, and when the driver 
(part) will be included in the standard kernel.
Thank you for this patch. I'm looking forward to your answer.
Regards,
Phil
