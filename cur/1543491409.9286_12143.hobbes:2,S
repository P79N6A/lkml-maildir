   He should be able to allocate kernel pages and mmap() them to user
   space. Then he can DMA into the pages and wake up the user process
   when it's done.
This would work, but only if it is mlock'd (could be done by the
kernel, just set the appropriate vm_flags during the mmap) else the
swapper can toss it to disk at any time.
