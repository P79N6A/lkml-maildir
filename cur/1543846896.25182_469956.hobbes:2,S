Reminds me - I did a small change to avoid dependency on strlcpy.
You can see it here:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=14a036d2dc304797f3624c06bd6d2a1e9b59e45a
I strongly preferred 8 simple codelines as replacement for carrying
strlcpy in a seperate file. Feel free to include this in your unifdef
as you whish.
