Removing the depends won't be enough because CONFIG_PARAVIRT won't be
selected unless one of Xen, VMI, or lguest is selected. (PARAVIRT is
not visible on menuconfig, only PARAVIRT_GUEST, that doesn't enable any
code).
When hacking, I remove the 32-bit depends and add "select PARAVIRT" to
"menuconfig PARAVIRT_GUEST".
I think neither of the three guest implementations are ready for 64-bit
yet. I am working on Xen and it is far from being ready for inclusion. I
don't know about VMI and lguest.
If this is desirable for broader testing, we can make config PARAVIRT
visible and selectable on menuconfig, even when there is no guest
implementation being enabled. Should I do it?
Maybe should this force-paravirt mode be a kernel debugging option?
