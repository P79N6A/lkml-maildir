Hi!
It may seem like crazyness, anyway:
did anyone get fbcon-mac to work on PC? fbcon-mac is as buggy as hell,
and I'd like to debug it on my pc before moving to Velo. It would
actually be usable: other framebuffers can not handle 4x6 font, on
1024x768 console it should give me 256x128 text resolution -- not bad.
