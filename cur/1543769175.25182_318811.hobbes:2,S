Hello,
I've created a bugreport at 
http://bugme.osdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4472
and I was advised to write to this list.
A patch called "loop device recursion avoidance" which appeared in
2.6.11 kernel has complicated ISO image mounting from another mounted
media.
Example:
# mount /mnt/dvd
# mount -o loop /mnt/dvd/file.iso /somedir
The mount command produces this error: "ioctl: LOOP_SET_FD: Invalid argument".
This operation maybe is a kind of recursion but I think that recursion
should be limited - not disabled.
Now I have to copy the ISO image to my hdd before mounting. I used to
put CD backups on DVDs; now it's more complicated to use.
I am not a "linux-kernel" subscriber so please CC me to: lubosd at gmail com.
Best regards,
Lubos Dolezel
