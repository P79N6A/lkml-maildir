I will but I dont have any such similar problem until 
2.4.19-pre7-ac4. The box is very stable; even with
2.4.19-pre7-ac4 if I did not exit X. 
ah, one more detail, actually the OOPS happened when
exiting X, not because of starting a new X server. The
other strange thing with 2.4.19-pre7-ac4 is it can not
turn off the computer if I run ` sudo  halt`  as a
child process of icewm, If I start a new terminal and
run  sudo  halt   ; X goes down and if during that I
press Alt + F1  the text screen appear and it can turn
off. I think this problem related to the OOPS ; 
How it is possible?
May be there is a change in the kernel setup, or
memory allocation etc..?
