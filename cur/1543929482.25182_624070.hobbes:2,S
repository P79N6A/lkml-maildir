(This is waaay over my head.)
Why do you think the two plots (at least the second one)
were not obtained as you describe?
Why would the system manufacturer botch the measurements
when I asked them to show me evidence that their system
was compliant?

I don't understand this 10-20% figure.
(0V + 10-20% is still 0V.)
AFAIU, the nominal peak-to-peak voltage is 3.3V. The observed
peak-to-peak voltage is 6.08V (3.3V + 84%).
