Uh, what do you do - SMB over a 300 bps link? I've not seen it be *that*  
slow, ever, even though our server is far from being a fast machine, and  
(until recently) we only had 10Mbit ethernet.

What's new about typing tab? It's a *lot* older than VFAT or NTFS. I've  
even had it under DOS (using 4dos) since practically forever. And besides,  
it's a much larger convenience than using 8+3 aliases; I'd hate to have to  
type out even those.
