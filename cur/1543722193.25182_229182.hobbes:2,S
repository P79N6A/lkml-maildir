No it does not. If 'export KBUILD_OUTPUT=/foo' command is used used before
kernel is built, it is not any more difficult to compile external modules
with that same env variable defined.

If and when external module build scripts are updated to automatically
detect the /lib/modules/`uname -r`/object symlink, users can even unset the
KBUILD_OUTPUT= env variable and external modules will still compile ok.

You seem to be in some strange "I must destroy... I must destroy... I must
destroy..." mental state. There is a no-breakage alternative and you just
will not consider that at all.

Nope. Solution #3 is the minimal breakage solution.

In which case Andrew and Linus should consider revoking your kbuild
maintainer status. I moved Andrew and Linus from CC list to TO list in hope
to get this small question answered:
Andrew, Linus,
How about choosing someone else less destructive to maintain kbuild?

Same 'export KBUILD_OUTPUT=/foo' will work the same for kernel build and
external module build. Your "FAIL *1" is bogus.

Same 'export KBUILD_OUTPUT=/foo' will work the same for kernel build and
external module build. Your "FAIL *2" is also bogus.
> FAIL *3 Grep will fail because it try to grep in files located under build/
Yep.
