So sparse offsets are supported, with some special cares on ->start.
My case is to scan the address space in ranges. The "object" is the
start offset of a range:
__________________#######______________________#############__________
                  ^start                       ^start
Now the solution can be:
        - ->show shows the current range
        - ->next seeks to next range
        - ->start must *also* do the seek
The last requirement is made clear by you, a fact I refused to accept :)
My old concept was that a ->next should be called to move pages
forward after a new start.
