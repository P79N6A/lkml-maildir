That's orthogonal to whether that patch caused a regression,
of course.  The operational semantics have, except when they
were changed, been that it did what it needed to do.

Maybe -- such a change would have been OK as part of the patch
which changed the operational semantics of Kconfig.
For better or worse, operational semantics are most of what we
have to go by here.  It would be nice if they were cleanly and
clearly specified, like a Prolog engine ... just a simple little
tristate logic engine, provably correct, with some UI wrappers.
But that's not what we have today.

Well, avoiding such error-prone idioms would seem good to me.
They're common enough, and nasty.  But that's not why those
mechanisms are there.

The requirements are that (a) just one peripheral controller
driver be selectable, and (b) that it be linked either
statically or dynamically.  Related, that for the gadget
drivers (c) none may be selected until the peripheral
controller driver they'll be used with is known, and either
(d1) one may be statically linked, or else (d2) any number
may be built as modules, with only one loaded at a time.
This stuff isn't for "distro" kernels; it's for embedded
environments of the "only this hardware exists" sort.
Space matters, and having small code matters.  Nobody has
been interested enough in an "embedded distro" model to
provide patches enabling such stuff.

Yes.  We may want to change that requirement at some point,
but as a rule there can be no more than one upstream USB link
in systems certified as USB conformant.  Most hardware doesn't
even allow it.
Certainly, *right now* we don't support multiple upstream
links, and that's been true for as long as that driver stack
has existed.
