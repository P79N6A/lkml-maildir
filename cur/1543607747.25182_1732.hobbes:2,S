Found this and didn't have time to mail it from work..
Someone has a problem typing in numbers. Given the number of typo's I've seen 
corrected in previous versions of the trident driver, it's not totally 
suprising, but annoying none the less.
Haven't checked if it fixes my problem, but I do know that it had no chance 
of working with the wrong PCI Vendor ID.
