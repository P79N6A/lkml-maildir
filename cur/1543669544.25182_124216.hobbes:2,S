    Yes !! I agree. I am not worried about running out them.
    I am more worried about names slipping. I atleast hope
    to see device names not changing by just doing
    rmmod/insmod.
But you see, the present sd_index_bits[] gives no such
guarantee. In sd_detach a bit is cleared, in sd_attach
the first free bit is given out. There is no memory.
