you can use kmsgdump (you should find it on sourceforge or similar). It
allows you to dump the oops to a floppy.
you can also try to apply 02-revert-fast-pte-2.bz2 and see if the
problem goes away. It must be some driver or something that deadlocks
the machine for you, I can't reproduce it here. Maybe you're using AGP
or some binary only module?
If the problem goes away by applying 02-revert-fast-pte-2.bz2 you can
back it out again and apply as well the debugging patch I posted
yesterday to l-k, so we'll get a stack trace in the right place.
