Because it's a generally useful function, /dev/random and /dev/urandom
are in the kernel, /dev/urandom is SLOW. And doing a userspace solution
is a bitch in shell scripts ;-)
Since bloat is being discussed in several threads, you may want to
propose that /dev/*random be config options in the "delete features for
size" section.
