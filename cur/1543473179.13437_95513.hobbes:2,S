  There seems to be a long standing bug with the buslogic SCSI driver w/ my
  system. The system is a Dual P5MMX. Since kernel 2.1.105 (or so, I've
  forgotten) the computer hard locks (leds wont change or anything) when
  playing sound (via SB16). Problem does not occur in UP mode or when using
  any other SCSI driver.
  I've tested three sound cards, two other Dual P5MMX systems, and 2 other
  scsi controlers (aic7xxx). 
  The system only dies with the Buslogic driver (I'm using a BT-956C). 
  Any assistance would be welcomed. If needed I can provide root access on
  this box. Thanks.

Please send me the startup messages from the BusLogic driver and the SCSI
subsystem.  Unfortunately, I do not have a similar enough configuration to
attempt to reproduce this problem.  Determining the precise kernel version at
which this problem began would be a good strategy.  Also, some versions of
BT-956C firmware had a condition where the host adapter could lock up.
