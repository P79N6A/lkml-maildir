I've done that in the past (USB, PCMCIA - screw the maintainers, redo 
it basically from scratch). But the thing is, I'm totally uninterested 
personally in the whole disk-snapshotting, so I'm not likely to do it 
there.
But yes, I'm actually hoping that some new person will come in with a new 
idea. The current people seem to be too set in "their" corners, and I 
don't expect that to really change.
Quite honestly, I don't foresee any of the current tree approaches really 
doing something new and obviously better, unless somebody new steps in.
