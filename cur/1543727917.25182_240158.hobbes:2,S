Pretty much, but you must change ownership first to
keep the user from changing the mode back. There are
ways for an evildoer to win this race if you don't
change the ownership first.
Now all we need is revoke() and we're all set.
Ordering: chown, chmod, revoke, unlink
BTW, I'm make revoke() just force re-verification
of file access.
