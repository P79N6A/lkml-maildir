I think I agree with you. As far as the kernel is concerned, "isspace()" 
should just accept the obvious spaces (hardspace, tab, newline), and 
*perhaps* the VT/FF kind of things.
You should realize that the kernel <ctype.h> thing is *ancient*. It's 
basically there from v0.01, and while the really original one (I just 
checked) had all the non-ascii characters not trigger anything, it was 
converted to be latin1 in the 2.1.x timeframe.
That's a *loong* time ago. Way before UTF-8 and other things were really 
common.
So we should probably just make all the upper 128 bytes go back to "don't 
trigger anything in ctype.h" - they'd not be spaces, but they'd not be 
control characters or anything else either.
