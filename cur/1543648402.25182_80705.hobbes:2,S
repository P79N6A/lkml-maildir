Your welcome. This is your code :
for (;;) {
     fd = event_wait(...);
     while (do_io(fd) != EAGAIN);
}
If the I/O space is not exhausted when you call event_wait(...); you'll
never receive the event because you'll be waiting a 0->1 transaction
without bringing the signal to 0 ( I/O space exhausted ). That one is a
typical use of poll() - select() - /dev/poll and you showed pretty clearly
that you do not seem to understand edge triggered event APIs. If you code
your I/O function like :
int my_io(...) {
	if (event_wait(...))
		do_io(...);
}
and you consume only part of the I/O space with the first call to my_io(),
the second call will block _infinitely_.
