Yes. As well as the ones of a Transmeta etc.
I just haven't tested the old Cyrixes, that
AFAIK were trying to ignore some Intel bugs.
The test-case for the bug is here:

Same as for the Intel ones - unless you are
a dosemu or, in a lesser extent, Wine user -
nothing except for fixing the small "information
leak".
If you are the dosemu user however, then this
patch adds a lot. Whether or not it adds
something for the VMWare users I can't say, since
I am not the one of them, but my guess is that
it can help with the DOS programs under it.
