This uses the basic rlimits infrastructure.  You can manage it manually
in a shell with ulimit -l, or you can use pam (pam_limits) to configure
per uid limits.  There's a pam doc that describes limits, and a manpage
for ulimit.  It's really easy to use, and should eliminate the need for
the mlock part of that module.
