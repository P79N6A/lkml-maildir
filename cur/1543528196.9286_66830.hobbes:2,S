I have an NFS server running 2.2.13 (smp) and a client running
2.2.12-20smp.  I am seeing error like this on the client system:
nfs: server khan2 not responding, still trying
nfs: server khan2 OK   
I put a note on Redhat's bug tracking system thinking it was something
with NFS, they came back and said:

Could somone point me in the right direction on changing the number of
kernel sockets.  
I have been looking in /proc/net/sockstat and getting resaults like this:
sockets: used 243
TCP: inuse 141 highest 223
UDP: inuse 36 highest 64
RAW: inuse 2 highest 7
Am I looking in the right place here?  Any help would be apprecated,
thanks.
Luke
