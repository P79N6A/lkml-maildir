What is so nice about this? That Linux novice user with his new lappie
will join a neighbor's network every time he powers up the lappie,
even without knowing that?
That will be analogous to me plugging ethernet cable into the switch and
wanting it to work, without any IP addr config, even without DHCP client.
Just power up the box (or modprobe an eth module) and it works! Cool, eh?
For some reason, we do not do this for wired nets. Why should wireless
be different?
