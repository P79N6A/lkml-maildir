... Becouse the chances are fscking high - that you will miss command
completion interrupts for the "other drive" on the same channel.
The dready heritage of "dangling ISA bus" with *idiotic* edge triggered
interrupts bite us here. Someone just please shoot this enginer
who saved the few pullup resistors in the head or send him alternatively
for "hunting white bears" in Siberia... about 15 years would be fine in my
opinnion.

Don't worry - I got your point.
