Fortunately, it would take a long flight of imagination to classify
ndiswrapper as "software that circumvents copyright protections".  One
would have to claim that ndiswrapper is "bundling" itself with non-free
code and "distributing" that "bundle" from the hard drive into RAM, or
something just as ridiculous.
Anyway, I'm glad that the sanity has prevailed for now.
