Yep, I'm a dummy. The failure I was thinking of was w/the completely
flaky 3rd-gen iPod, just went back and looked at logs.
So far as I can tell, I'm thinking 128k limit + fix capacity should be
okay for both the 2nd and 3rd-gen iPods, and if someone comes up with
evidence that the 2nd-gen does something badly w/the fix capacity
workaround enabled, then we revisit trying to apply the workarounds
more narrowly somehow.
