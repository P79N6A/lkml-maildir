Hi Ted,
Would you mind if I removed TIOCTTYGSTRUCT?
I suppose you don't need it any longer, and otherwise
could easily add some debugging stuff again when needed.
This ioctl exports lots of kernel-internal stuff that
userspace has no business looking at.
The direct reason I ask is that it also exports a kdev_t,
and the meaning of that will change.
