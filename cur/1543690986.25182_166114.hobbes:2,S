Any time someone messes with the clock timing code, they always
break Sparc.
We have to make assumptions about several things, one of which
is the clock crystal used because the Sun firmware provides
no way to just guess this so we just have to know what it is.
Second, as you mention we reverse calculate the clocks to turn the
video mode the firmware brought the card up in into the parameters the
driver wants.
Please, can we revert your changes if we can't fix Sparc quickly?
This is a pretty serious regression you've added and I have this
feeling it's going to stay broke for some time as you go back and
forth with us trying to resolve this.
