The vmscan patch doesn't seem to help in the 'make -j' testcase.  
Here's time of a couple runs:
2.4.17 vanilla
real    32m2.097s
user    9m51.800s
sys     3m47.700s
real    19m45.696s
user    9m55.820s
sys     2m32.170s
2.4.17 + vmscan patch
gave up waiting after 2 hours...never finished.
Unfortunately, box was not responsive enough to gather any useful
information.  Perhaps not swapping enough???

I tried just about everything I could think of and it never went in OOM.
Even
the first test I did were with several days uptime - meaning far away
from
"cleaning" reboot. I hate reboot :-)

Well, take the other side: if you do not manage to OOM afterwards, even
at the
tenth consecutive try, there is probably something about the patch ...
