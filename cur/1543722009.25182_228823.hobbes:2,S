ChangeLogs are available, amongst other things the ChangeLogs contain info
on who wrote or submitted the patch. For more info read the MAINTAINERS
& CREDITS files as well as source code comments in the source files
themselves.
Other people can probably point you at more...
Btw, what are you going to use this info for? I'm currious (and I'm sure
other people are as well).
