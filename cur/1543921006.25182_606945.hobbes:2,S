It seems to me if I look at the code, that it's intended to make a bool out of 'out'. That's
nonsense because of the precedence the ! will turn it into a boolean before the & 0x1.
x = !x & y behaves like x = !x for y != 0. 
for y = 1 the behavior is even the same for x = !(x & y)
so it does not matter in this case, except for clarity. I'll make it out = !out.

ok, thanks, I'll correct and omit these in my follow up patch.
