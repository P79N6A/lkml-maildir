In the 2.0.x kernels, there is a timeout field in struct task_struct,
which can be used to implement a polling delay. In the later 2.1.x kernels
this field has been removed. I was wondering how a polling delay is now
implemented in the 2.1.x kernels without this field, which seems to be
missing now.
Should I make use of a task_queue, or a loop where I calculate the number
of jiffies until the next poll and do something along the lines of:
	while (jiffies < jiffies_at_next_poll)
   	    schedule();
I realise that this might be totally off topic, but I have no idea where
else to make a start. Feel free to point me in the right direction if this
is an inappropriate post (in which case, I'll apologise in advance)
Regards,
Simon
