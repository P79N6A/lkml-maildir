Well, they FORCE the use of the C states to save power, even if the 
kernel doesn't want to because it still has runnable tasks.  This can be 
useful if you know you are running a task that busy waits but would not 
suffer from having the performance of the cpu cut in half.  Since it is 
busy waiting, the kernel never activates the C states, but the 
throttling will force it and thus, save you power and heat.
