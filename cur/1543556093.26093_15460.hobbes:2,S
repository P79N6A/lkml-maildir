Section 7 paragraph 3 relates to patent infringement. The GNU WWW site is
extremely clear on this issue:
"You should also have the freedom to make modifications and use them privately
in your own work or play, without even mentioning that they exist."
(
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html
). No restrictions are imposed in
the GPL; none are intended, according to the FSF.
[jas88@dax linux-2.4.0-test11.vanilla]$ grep -i --context=3 commercial COPYING
    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
That's the only occurrence of the word "commercial" in the GPL.

Nope. RMS defined the terms which apply to GPL code. You are free to define any
other terms you like for your own code, but it is no longer GPLed in that case.
