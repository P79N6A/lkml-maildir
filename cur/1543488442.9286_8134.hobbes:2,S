Hi,
sorry I can't give you an exact answer since I don't have this soundcard
any more... but I had a Creative Vibra 16x PnP which worked fine - but
only if I told the sb driver that it should use _the same dma channel for
both 8 and 16 bit_ !!!
I can't remember the exact parameters, but I think it was dma=1 and
dma16=1.
Sure, this is braindead - but I could play mpeg audio files with these
settings.
Bye, Patrick
