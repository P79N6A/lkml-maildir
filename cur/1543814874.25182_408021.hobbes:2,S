Believe it or not,  but I actually do try to think about the patches I submit.
I make mistakes sometimes and I don't know all the code in as much
depth as I would like, but I do try to help out the best I can.
I appreciate feedback on the work I do, and I try to improve based on
it - this means I also value your feedback although I must say I
dislike your tone.
I'll stare at the code some more and try to come up with a better
patch after I've had some sleep.
