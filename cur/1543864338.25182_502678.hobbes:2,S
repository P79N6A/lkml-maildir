You can read config space, but it's not clear to me if the HV is allowed
to filter it and hide things. It's also possible that the device
supports MSI, but for some reason the HV doesn't allow it on that device
etc. so you really have to ask the HV if it's enabled. So pci_find_cap()
shouldn't crash or anything, but it may lie to you.

It would be good to have a common data structure if possible. My
thinking was that most of the information is per pci_dev, so that's
where I put it. I realise the Intel code stores some info that's
per-irq, but most of it is per-device. I hadn't got anywhere near coding
it, but my vague idea was to add a arch_data (or whatever) pointer to my
msi_info struct, which would allow backends to stash stuff.
I think the pci_intx() calls can be in the core.
Munging dev->irq could be in the core, assuming it's left in some known
location by the code. On the other hand we might want to decide it's a
bad idea altogether.
One thing I did like about my code, is that pci_enable_msi() and
pci_enable_msix() are just small wrappers around generic_enable_msi() -
which does all the work, and is the same regardless of whether it's an
MSI or MSI-X. Although that's facilitated by the type arg which you
don't like.
