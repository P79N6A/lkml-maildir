I think we should try to fix invalidatepage instead, and just always
remove it from the LRU.
(If invalidatepage fails, we can just leave the page as an anonymous page
_off_ the LRU, and let whoever holds a reference to the page eventually
drop it, whatever).

I'd _really_ really prefer to go the other way. I think this brokenness is
all from that one broken patch that removed the "remove from LRU".
And from what I can tell, that broken patch has no real point to it
anyway.
