Hi Adrian,
	Sorry for a bit of delay... We are away at an SCTP Interoperability 
event.

Are you sure?  I vaguely remember one of the network structs having 
#ifdef'd fields for v6.   Consequently, if one compiles first without, 
but the tries later compiles/loads ipv6... bad things happen as the 
kernel has a different concept of what the sock is.

Yes.  The intent was to at least discourage a configuration that will 
segfault.
