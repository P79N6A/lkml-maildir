What happens here is that make resort to a chained rule to create the
irlan.o file.
The chain goes from SCCS/%.c -> %.c -> %.s -> %.o
The two files %.c and %.s is considered intermidiate files, and make
guarantees that intermidiate files that did not exist when
make was called, does not exists when make exists.
This is reported by make with the "rm ..." line.
See info make -> Implicit rules - > Chained rules
The reason why you see this is that there is no implicit rule from SCCS/%.c -> %.c
wich is because kbuild does not 'know' of SCCS/* - but make uses some build-in
rule for this.
Two questions pops up though.
First my make documentatin say the make would use "rm -f ...",not "rm".
What make version do you use?
Also I would expect to see irlan_client.s to be deleted also - did you miss that?
It may show up a bit later.
