That's a good point, and one I would be happy with.  (or, ditch -all-
current config code, and replace with the existing mconfig)
Eric's configurator definitely seems to have a place with users.  Making
kernel configuration easier for the masses is more than fine with me... 
Impacting kernel developers' productivity and workflow because of this
is more of what I object to...
