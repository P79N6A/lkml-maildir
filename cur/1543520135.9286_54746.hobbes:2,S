How quickly can an interupt be received by user space and be acted on. 
I don't know enough about the latency issues of user vs. kernel space.
Anyway, I wouldn't be worried about the low water mark IRQ being acted
on slowly as much as the high mark.  A FIFO overflow would cause missed
commands.
Though I suppose if the firing of the watermark IRQs could be adjusted
to be sooner the latency could be compensated for, but the amount of
compensation required would vary depending on system load.
