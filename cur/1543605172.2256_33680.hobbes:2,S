If it only happens when the ISP drops the connection while running mppp, I
can easily avoid the situation until a solution gets developed. My ISP
drops the connection automatically after 12 hours but allows immediate
reconnection. So a little magic with ip-up, cron, and ip-down is enough to
avoid the bug, I can easily disable mppp and the connection a few minutes
before the 12 hours pass and then bring the connection and mppp back up a
few moments later.
