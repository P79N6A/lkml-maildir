this was done intentionally, and this scenario (1+2 tasks) is the very
worst scenario. The problem is that by trying to balance all 3 tasks we
now have 3 tasks that trash their cache going from one CPU to another.  
(this is what happens with your patch - even with another approach we'd
have to trash at least one task)
By keeping 2 tasks on one CPU and 1 task on the other CPU we avoid
cross-CPU migration of threads. Think about the 2+3 or 4+5 tasks case
rather, do we want absolutely perfect balancing, or good SMP affinity and
good combined performance?
