Hello,
 I recently bought 
Highpoint RocketRaid 1520 pci - dual channel -  sata cards - chip is HPT372N -   
to use as simple block devices for linux software raid purposes.   I thought 
they were supported on Linux, because of highpoint web site and my previous 
experience with highpoint pata controllers was ok.
 However I get the same kernel OOPS reported by Johan Palmqvist on Mon Nov 07 
2005 with the latest stable kernel 2.6.14.4 .
 I also see a posting from Mar 17 2003 by Henning Schroeder reporting success 
with the highpoint driver hpt3xx-opensource-v131.tgz. 
 I tried to compile the hpt3xx-opensource-v2.0.tgz against latest stable 
kernel 2.6.14.4. After minor corrections   I have failure to compile their 
driver due to  scsi_cmnd structure "has no member abort_reason".  Has their 
been a change in scsi subsystem? 
 Which kernel can I use? Any advice? Sorry to interrupt your amazing work with 
my question. I am off list. I will read list but cc is appreciated. 
 Thanks Gurus!
