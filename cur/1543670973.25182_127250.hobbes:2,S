I don't think this is PCMCIA related - something else is going on here.
My guess is we're trying to locate a driver for the card, and we get to
maestro3.  This works as expected, but the next driver on the chain
seems to be a module which was may have been removed but which left
its pci_driver structure behind (at 0xd10545c0.)
Decoding the attached x86 opcodes didn't reveal anything interesting to
me.
Anyone else?
