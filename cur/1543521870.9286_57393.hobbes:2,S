	You don't need inodes for that. If it is done on per-opener basis
- forget all stuff with minors and associate the data with struct file.
file->private is your friend.

It wouldn't. Moreover, it's blatantly bad policy - you need (a) writable
/dev (bad idea security-wise) and (b) unique name generation in said /dev.
Worse yet, you have to deal with situations when somebody grabs a
reference to such file and holds it, thus creating an easy DoS - keep
doing that and you'll be out of inodes on root.

Please, don't. Could you show me your code? Probably I can help with that
problem.
