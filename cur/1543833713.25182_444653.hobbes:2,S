The attraction is that the kernel abstractions are very nice.
Much of the POSIX API sucks ass. The kernel stuff is NOT crap.
Here we have a full-featured set of atomic ops, byte swapping
with readable names and a distinction for pointers, nice macros
for efficient data structure manipulation...
Sure, you'd like all the app developers to write bloated C++
and use sucky POSIX threads stuff, but then you're not the
one who has to write or maintain it.
Don't blame app developers if they go for what is good.
To stop them, provide the goodness in a sane way.
(alternately, make the Linux code suck ass more than POSIX)
