pcp->batch = max(1UL, batch/2); is the line of code that is setting the
batch value for the cold pcp list.  batch is just a number that we
counted based on some parameters earlier.

Not every time there is a request for higher order pages.  That surely
will defeat the purpose of pcps.  But my suggestion is only to drain
when the the global pool is not able to service the request.  In the
pathological case where the higher order and zero order requests are
alternating you could have thrashing in terms of pages moving to pcp for
them to move back to global list.

The original change was to try to allocate a higher order page to
service a batch size bulk request.  This was with the hope that better
physical contiguity will spread the data better across big caches.
