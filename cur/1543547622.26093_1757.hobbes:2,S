WOOHOO, you remember!!!!  Way to go Alan!!!!
You and several others know that I stink at describing a complex point
regardless that I understand it completely.  I am just glad that you hung
in there long enough for me to get the point across.
Everyone owes HPA a debt of thanks for suffering the most to help me
explain what it is I know but could not describe.  If you ever have a
problem and need a sound board that will make you think in ways you have
never tried before, HPA is the man!
