Please read Druschel and Peterson's paper on fbufs and any followon
work before going down this path.  Fbufs are exactly what you are
proposing as a workaround for the VM cost of page flipping, and the
idea has been around since 1993. :-)
As I mentioned Chapter 5 of Networking Algorithmics discusses this
in detail, and also covers many related attempts such as I/O
Lite.
