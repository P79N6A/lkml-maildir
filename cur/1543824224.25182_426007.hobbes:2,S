             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       4049724    4021196      28528          0      16384    3217288

This is an 64 bit machine, the "concentrator".
It looks like use all, the 4G ram as "lowmem".
If i replace the cpu on my nodes to 64bit capable ones, i can use all the
memory as buffer-cache? :-)
