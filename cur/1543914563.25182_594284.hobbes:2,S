The reason for this is that the only way to write a userspace "driver"
for USB devices on Windows versions prior to Vista was to be a HID
device.  Your userspace program could then easily grab the device and
control it.
This could be fixed in Linux by providing a way to have driver
"heirachy" for USB whereby a vendor/product id providing driver would
take a higher priority than a class driver.
But we've been talking about that for over 7 years now :)
