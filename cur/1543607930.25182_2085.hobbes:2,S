I see the proposed implementation as a decisive cut with the try to have
processes instantly moved across CPUs and stuff like na_goodness, etc..
Inside each CPU the scheduler is _exactly_ the same as the UP one.

Hey, ... that's part of Episode 2 " Balancing the world", where the evil
Mr. MoveSoon fight with Hysteresis for the universe domination :)
