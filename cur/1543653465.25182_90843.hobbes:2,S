I think that retrieving module name from module's binary is wrong: I
need to have dummy.o (network driver) insmodded two times to get my
test environment up. 
I do not think that it is correct that I must add multiple device support 
to the dummy due to new module loader, and creating two dummy.o,
with different .modulename sections, also does not look like reasonable
solution to me.
