Candidate patch for clearing that up as been posted. Thanks for cc'ing me
on this as I would have missed it.

I think there is a problem there all right. VM_ACCOUNT will not be set
with the other patch applied but VM_NORESERVE might be. If so, we
potentially set VM_ACCOUNT on a hugetlbfs mapping and probably make a
mess out of Committed_AS later. Maybe something like the following?
================
Do not account for address space usage when making hugetlbfs mappings RW
hugetlbfs accounts for its address space usage separate from the VM
core. VM_ACCOUNT should not be set for its mappings but it is possible it gets
set if a user creates a RO hugetlbfs mapping MAP_NORESERVE and then calls
mprotect(). This patch stops VM_ACCOUNT being set for hugetlbfs mappings
during mprotect().
Credit goes to Kosaki Motohiro for spotting this.
