Linus,
Please pull from 'for_linus' branch at
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/galak/powerpc.git for_linus
To get a fix for 2.6.22 to the rheap allocator that was causing multiple
instances of the UCC ethernet driver to fail because it was running out of
memory due to wasting space for aligned requests.
Thanks,
Kumar.

    [POWERPC] rheap - eliminates internal fragments caused by alignment
    The patch adds fragments caused by rh_alloc_align() back to free list, instead
    of allocating the whole chunk of memory.  This will greatly improve memory
    utilization managed by rheap.
    It solves MURAM not enough problem with 3 UCCs enabled on MPC8323.
