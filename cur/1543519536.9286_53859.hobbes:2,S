Subject: Kernel disallowed exec of *some* suid/sgid for a few minutes

last night i built 2.3.33 and applied the usb afs/euro urb patch.  it
patched cleanly and seems to run cleanly save for one thing.
i could not exec all suid/sgid programs.  operation not permitted.  yes, i
had the right mount options on the partition, 'su', 'rxvt', and etc, are on
the same partition.  i could run su but i couldn't run rxvt (sgid tty) or
sendmail, suid/sgid mail.
thirty minutes into analyzing it, it magically fixed itself.  it was
literally hitting the up arrow on 'rxvt' and it launched.
i have been unable to reproduce it.  i have rebooted a few times and tried
all sorts of possibilities.  being that i can't reproduce it any longer,
this is just an FYI message.
