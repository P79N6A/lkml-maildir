Wrong.  Op-codes on this machine are organised such that bits 31-28
indicate the "condition" that the instruction executes.  All 16
combinations are meaningful.  This means that any 32-bit value can
appear to be an instruction OR data.  It takes human intellect to
decide which it is.  No machine can tell you that.

But there could well be a symbol for 0xc0023004, but it also
corresponds to the instruction:
	andgt   r3, r2, r4
"Perform a logical AND operation between r2 and r4 and place the result
 in r3 if the condition codes indicate the `Greater Than' condition"
In addition, the kernel may not be compiled to run at address 0xC.......
but at address 0x6....... or maybe even 0xe.......  Guess what 0xE means
in the high nibble of the op-code?  "Always", or "Unconditional".

As far as I am concerned, you are the people who propose to break
something, and therefore you are the people who should provide the
effort to fix what you will be breaking when the brokenness is
highlighted.
