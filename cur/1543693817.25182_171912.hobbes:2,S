And on some systems, the resume path even works ... :)
The D3cold resume path -- which should behave very much
like resuming from software suspend -- can be made to
self-deadlock in some cases:  dpm_sem is held while the
resume callbacks are made, so they deadlock when calls to
device_del (for getting rid of the old device tree) try
to grab the same lock.
So don't get your hopes up too far yet -- but yes,
that usbcore patch does help some configs a bunch.
