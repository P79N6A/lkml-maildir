Hello all...
I've got an Abit NF7-S v2.0 mainboard with an Athlon XP 2000+ CPU.
Yesterday I've compiled the 2.6.0-test9 kernel with -mm1 patch. My
system is on the first sata device (/dev/hde).
After reboot I've noticed an Oops after setting dma and other settings
with hdparm. Without -mm1 patch the machine works well. 
After the oops I've tried to find what the problem was. 
hdparm -c1 /dev/hde -> nothing was happened, switched off...
hdparm -d1 /dev/hde -> Oops...
I've got this messages:
hde: DMA timeout retry status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady
SeekComplete DataRequest }
ide2: reset phy, status=0x00000113 siimage_reset
.
.
.
Buffer I/O error on device hde2, logical block 97865
lost page write due to I/O error on hde2
.
.
.
EXT3-fs error (device hde2) in start_transaction: Journal has aborted
The rootfs is /dev/hde2.
Please cc the answers to my address, because I'm not lkml member...
Thanks:
