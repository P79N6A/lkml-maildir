I am seeing __idiv3 and __imod3 unresolved externals if I attempt the
following within a kernel modules:
(long long) val / (long) val1;
and
(long long) val % (long) val1;
Is there a compiler switch somewhere to forced the compiler to inline
this code for 64-bit divides and modulo operations or include it from a
macro library somewhere for IA32 systems that want to support 64-bit
filesystem math without being like broken NT and needing stupid kernel
library functions to do this?
NT i.e. LARGE_INTEGER typedef functions.
:-)
