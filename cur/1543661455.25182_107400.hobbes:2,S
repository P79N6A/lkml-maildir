The thing is, RockRidge attributes are a file-by-file thing.  You can
have it on half the files if you want.
Of course, since Linux isn't dependent on the inode numbers to find the
directory entries anymore (since we now have dentries), one could
rewrite the iso9660 filesystem so that it doesn't matter.  This is a
major rewrite, however.  It wouldn't be unwelcome; the current code is
pretty awful.
