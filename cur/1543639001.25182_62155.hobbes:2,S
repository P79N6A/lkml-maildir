Hello sir:	
I have some Error report when I use boot_logo, after I patch it into my 
kernel-2.4.18, and try to select following menu:
			Main Menu
				==>Console drivers -->
					==>Frame-buffer support -->
some report like following message:
			Q> scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu64: command not found
My kernel version is: 2.4.18
finally, I have to telling you, sir, my english is very poor.
