I think we must first find out what partition table you have.
Please send me the output of
sfdisk -l -x -uS /dev/hda

[I would also be interested in the sequence of events that lead
to this. Recently I have seen a few people with very strange
partition tables, and I would like to know what the cause of
this sudden flurry of peculiarities is. Did you use Disk Druid?
Did you mix for example Win98 FDISK and WinNT FDISK?]
