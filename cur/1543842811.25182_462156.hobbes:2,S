Why would saving/restoring %fs be quicker?  The main reason I chose %gs 
was so that it didn't add anything to the context switch time (since %gs 
needed to be switched anyway), and it leaves open the possibility of 
using gcc's TLS support in the kernel (I have a working demonstration of 
this, but Rusty and I are still working out the module details).
