     This has pretty much always been my experience with Adaptec controllers,
from Linux .98 to current.
     Every one I've had fail has failed flakey like this.  Start out with a
bus, maybe five devices on the bus, everything has run OK for a couple of
months, and then I start seeing SCSI errors. 
     So I mess around, try to eliminate devices to no avail; and finally I swap
out the passive terminator with an active..  Then things run OK again, for a
couple of months.  Then errors start creeping in again, timeouts, occasional
bus hangs.  Then I swap out the active for a forced-perfect terminator; and
again, things behave for a while. 
     Then after a couple of months things start flaking out again; and I go
through and replace all the cabling with the shortest cables I can get away
with, and things seem to stablize for a while, then the errors start occuring
again.
     And I can't get them to stop for anything.  Replace the controller, things
are good for a while, 4 or 5 months later they start flaking again.  Replace
the controller again, another 4 or 5 quiet months.
     Finally, replace Adaptec with Buslogics (or whatever the name of the
company that bought them)...  No more problems. 
     I don't know what it is about Adaptec's, maybe I've just been unlucky, but
I am personally convinced there is something about the bus drivers or
tranceivers that gradually degrade.
