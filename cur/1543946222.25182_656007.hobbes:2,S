It's repeatable, but not in a really reliable way.
So to mark a kernel good I need to compile around 100 KDE packages,
and even then I'm not 100% sure, if it's good or if I was just lucky.
But I did a partly bisect against 2.6.24-rc6-mm1:
2.6.24-rc6 + mm-patches up to (including) git.nfsd -> worked
2.6.24-rc6 + mm-patches up to (including) git.xfs -> crashed
I think the only added patch between rc2-mm1 and rc3-mm2 in that range
where the iommu changes that I later ruled out.
That leaves some git trees as suspects:
git-ocfs2.patch
git-selinux.patch
git-s390.patch
git-sched.patch
git-sh.patch
git-scsi-misc.patch
git-unionfs.patch
git-v9fs.patch
git-watchdog.patch
git-wireless.patch
git-ipwireless_cs.patch
git-x86.patch
git-xfs.patch
