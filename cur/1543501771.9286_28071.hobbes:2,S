I don't think we want to be doing this for backups.

Nice.  Alternative: half the numbers are reserved for forward-assignment
by the client, half by the server.  The server can refuse to accept
client-assigned numbers at any time, and it also returns the
server-assigned numbers with client transactions using those numbers.
So things start quickly, and the client can replace its assignments with
stateless server assignments within one round trip.  If the server
decides not to maintain the state, or reboots or whatever, it can drop
client-side assignments at any time and the client will recover with a
retry if it's just starting out.  So the server can't get overloaded.
Rather like HTTP 1.1 can drop connections when the server decides it
wants to, but with even less state than TCP ;-)

No I don't like that idea either.
