As far as I know, Solaris won't use locking if it doesn't detect a
lockd daemon. (Note that we could easily implement that in the 'mount'
program for Linux; just use 'pmap_getport'.)
Your Solaris client will thus only give you local file locking, and
access by 2 different machines to the same file is not safe.
