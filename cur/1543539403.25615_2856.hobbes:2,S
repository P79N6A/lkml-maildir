I just upgraded from 2.4.0test1ac7 to test5pre3 and discovered that I
could no longer access past the first ~900MB of my DVDs:
Jul 20 22:57:51 rdaneel kernel: attempt to access beyond end of device 
Jul 20 22:57:51 rdaneel kernel: 03:40: rw=0, want=3163138, limit=899698 
I got the same limit=899698 on three discs of varying lengths and number
of layers.
Commenting out the following two lines (2276-7) of drivers/cdrom/cdrom.c
restores the previous (working) behavior so I can watch them:
if (!CDROM_CAN(CDC_CD_R | CDC_CD_RW | CDC_DVD_R | CDC_DVD_RAM))
		goto use_toc;
The drive is a Philips PCA532, it doesn't do any writing at all so this
was diverting it away from the working code to the Code of Doom... Don't
know whether the CoD itself is flawed or if my drive is reporting the
wrong thing to it when queried that way.
