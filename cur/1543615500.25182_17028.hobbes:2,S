A similar things happened to me. I have a Toshiba Satellite 4080 XCDT, and
switching from XFree to console and back to XFree becomed impossibile with the
upgrade to Redhat 7.x and XFree 4. The problem is that the apm script use to
switch to console mode when I suspend (es. closing the laptop) and when it
resumes it tries to switch to XFree again, but this messes the screen. I am
still able to come back to console and killall X, but of course I'll lose my
current not saved works under X.
Under XFree 3 I could switch from X to console and back without problems -
anyway, after a couple of switches my laptop used to hang. I think X writes to
the uncorrect memory regions causing my laptop to hang.
ciao
