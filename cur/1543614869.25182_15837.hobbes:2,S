Wrong.  Most patches are independant, and even touch different functions.  
Things like "add member foo of type baz to struct z" are independant 
changes even if they conflict when patching.

How about "I'm sick of resending this one line bugfix to maintainer of 
$foo who keeps dropping it"?  That's the problem that patchbot is meant 
to solve, not the merging problem.  If the people responsible for applying 
patches were perfect, we wouldn't need it.
