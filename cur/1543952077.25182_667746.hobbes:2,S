So it would seem I screwed up something in my testing, and failed to reproduce 
the panic after adding '[PATCH] firewire: fw-ohci: use dma_alloc_coherent for 
ar_buffer' to the mix. Best as I can tell now, the panic was actually 
resolved by that patch, as backing out the sync altogether now works just as 
well as with the sync, with an mb and with an mdelay.
This sort of makes some degree of sense, since this is another x86_64 system 
w/>= 4GB of RAM. It would appear possible that at some higher layer, where AT 
and AR transactions are coordinated with one another, we were getting an AT 
packet into a bad state due to its corresponding AR traffic being stuck in a 
non-coherent buffer we couldn't read. But this is only semi-informed 
speculation...
