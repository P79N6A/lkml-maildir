Properly used, asserts are not debugging code so much as executable design
constraints.  They are really useful as in-line documentation.  assert(arg !=
NULL) is much more powerful than a /* arg cannot be NULL */ comment.  The issue
of whether the assert actually generates code is secondary; the code *should*
run the same either way.
