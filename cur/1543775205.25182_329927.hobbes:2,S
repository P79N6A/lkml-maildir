The IOMMU is still used for some devices that are only 32bit in a 64bit 
OS. Linux actually will allocate the 64MB anyway, so it doesn't hurt to 
have the bios and linux in sync ;-)

Yeah, this is again something that ASUS would need to fix in their bios. 
I'm not sure how important it is though...
