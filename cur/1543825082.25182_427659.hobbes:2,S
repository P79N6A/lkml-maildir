Subject: Query: No IDE DMA for IBM 365X with PIIX chipset?

Hi there,
Have an old Thinkpad 365X laptop that 'hdparm -i' tells me is 
running mdma2 but it refuses to set dma mode.  2.6.16.18 also 
refuses to set dma.
With 2.432-hf32.6 running 'hdparm -c 1 /dev/hda' speeds up the 
IDE interface from ~5MB/s to ~7.5MB/s for a reading an unmounted 
500MB partition to /dev/null.
Is there something I forgot to do to get DMA operation, or this 
one of those early PIIX that Alan is doing new drivers for?  
I've yet to try development kernels since udev/pcmciautils not 
setup on the thing (yet).
