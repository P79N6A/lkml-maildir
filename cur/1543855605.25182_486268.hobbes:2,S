Hi Lee,
   The failure is a Gentoo sandbax failure. On the surface of it I
didn't really think it was a kernel problem but I know you've pushed
me to move to PAM telling me realtime-lsm wasn't going to work in the
future. I really just wanted to know that PAM was now a requirement
instead of only best practice.
Thanks,
Mark
