This is simply an attempt to reduce/combine work queues used by the Infiniband 
code.  This keeps the threading a little simpler in the rdma_cm, since all 
callbacks are invoked using the same work queue.  (I'm also using this with the 
local SA/multicast code, but that's not ready for merging.)

rdma_resolve_ip() is the operation actually being canceled if that makes it 
easier to come up with a better name.
