A possibility that no one has mentioned is to have a diskless
target machine, booting with TFTP and using an NFS root filesystem.
Boot NILO (www.nilo.org) on a floppy, and configure it to load
the kernel off a TFTP server, which would also be the machine you
compile and run kgdb on.
One advantage is that no matter how badly you crash the target
machine you won't corrupt the filesystem.
