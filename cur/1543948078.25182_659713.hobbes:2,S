Woah slow down guys. Did I miss the review?
Yes it's a 200 line patch, but it's a 200 line x86 patch. Surely we
should apply some of the same rigour we did when we merged the oprofile
patch? Is it biarch safe? Will it run on powerpc, arm etc?
I'm still struggling to understand why we need this functionality at
all. Lets argue the ABI and not cloud it with a discussion about
userspace eye candy. What does this give you that is an improvement over
the oprofile kernel-user ABI?
