Heck, why stop the overkill here, the whole patch is overkill ;-)

Thanks, so many places in the kernel have acronyms that are just suppose
to be "obvious". I hate them, because they make me feel so stupid when I
don't know what they are. After I find out, I usually slap my forehead and
say "duh!". My mind is set on reading code, not deciphering TLAs.

I said 'no' becaues of this:
+rcu_try_flip_idle(void)
+{
+       int cpu;
+
+       RCU_TRACE_ME(rcupreempt_trace_try_flip_i1);
+       if (!rcu_pending(smp_processor_id())) {
+               RCU_TRACE_ME(rcupreempt_trace_try_flip_ie1);
+               return 0;
+       }
But now I'm a bit more confused. :-/
Looking at the caller in kernel/timer.c I see
	if (rcu_pending(cpu))
		rcu_check_callbacks(cpu, user_tick);
And rcu_check_callbacks is the caller of rcu_try_flip. The confusion is
that we call this when we have a pending rcu, but if we have a pending
rcu, we won't flip the counter ??

Sure, why not. More and more and more overkill!!!

And this seem reasonable to me that this would be enough to satisfy a
grace period. But the CPU moving around the rcu_read_(un)lock's around.
Are we sure that adding all these grace periods stages is better than just
biting the bullet and put in a memory barrier?

Well, I hope you keep doing both for a long time to come.

That is definitely an accomplishment. And I know as well as you do that it
happened because of a lot of people sharing ideas. Some good, some bad,
but all helpful for heathy development!
