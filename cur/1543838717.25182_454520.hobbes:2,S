Why would you want o do this? It seems like a cruddier strategy 
than what we can already do  (which is to never get an transmit
interrupt, as long as the kernel can shove data into the device fast
enough to keep the queue from going empty.)  The whole *point* of a 
low-watermark interrupt is to never have to actually get the interrupt, 
if the rest of the system is on its toes and is supplying data fast
enough.
