OK - lets reset on the personal attacks stuff. I know there are people 
who like to goat people into fighting about this but STOP IT.
The question that should be answered is - is Reiser4 ready yet - and 
that should be answered only by people who actually know what they are 
talking about. Someone saying "I had Reiser 3 in 2001 and it crashed my 
drive man" has nothing to do with this decision.
So - may I ask ....
Does Reiser 4 break anything? What is the down side of including it?
Does Reiser 4 lack anything that is required? Has it met the criteria 
for inclusion?
If Reiser 4 isn't ready then what specifically needs to be done to get 
it ready? Let's post a list.
How ready is Reiser 4 compared to other file systems at the point of 
inclusion? Is it ripe yet?
