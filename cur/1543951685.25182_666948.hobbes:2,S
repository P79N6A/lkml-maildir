The logic in this case was that I don't really expect platform
setup code to check this stuff any more than it checks IRQ setup.
But, as the comment says, if platform setup code goofs, it can
cause un-bootable systems.  Ergo the pr_err().
It could be argued either way; that's just what I did, way back
when I noticed the issue.
