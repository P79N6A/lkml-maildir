Hi there.
I just went through the warnings that were thrown up when compiling
2.3.10 on my system, and the following patches basically fell out to
fix several of them, so here they are.
Before anybody asks, I ignored the various "defined but not used"
warnings, as those are generally minor. These are the more major
warnings...
First, a case of missing braces leading to incorrect logic. The macro
IFDEBUG expands to an if statement, and it's used at least once in the
then branch of another if statement, leading to incorrect nesting. The
following patch block puts the braces round all of the IFDEBUG blocks
to implement the nesting implied by the indentation, which looks
correct throughout...

Next, two function calls which return results that are ignored. I'm
not sure whether they should be ignored, but the following patch
documents the fact that they currently are.

Next, a couple of "variable may be undefined when used" warnings.
Whilst they are documented as being bogus warnings, it's actually
simple to get rid of them in the first place, and here's how.

Next, a for loop that does absolutely nothing, although the fact is
hidden by the location of the semicolon. This patch unhides that fact,
although I'd guess that it's actually a bug that needs some attention.
