Here you go:
In 2.6.12 we started dropping the conntrack reference when a packet
leaves the IP layer. This broke connection tracking on a bridge,
because bridge-netfilter defers calling some NF_IP_* hooks to the bridge
layer for locally generated packets going out a bridge, where the
conntrack reference is no longer available. This patch keeps the
reference in this case as a temporary solution, long term we will
remove the defered hook calling. No attempt is made to drop the
reference in the bridge-code when it is no longer needed, tc actions
could already have sent the packet anywhere.

Patrick
