Yes, mark_pages() and unmark_pages() can just be removed as soon as
you like.
I didn't reply to the original posting because I noticed they're not
all of the virt_to_page()s in sound/core, and sometimes a part-answer
distracts someone more competent from responding with the full answer.
And I'm in no hurry to remove these PageReserved traces myself, since
it's not a bad idea to hold on to the bad_page cross-checking for a
release or two.
