Hi Jeff,
it is NOT resolved: I just tried libata again, and I can  observe the 
same behaviour: I just did a "cat /dev/sda >/dev/null" and watched 
gkrellm2 showing the throughoutput. The first tiem I do the cat I only 
got about 27mb/s, no matter how ong I waited, but all subsequent cat 
gave me about >60mb/s. So there is a tiny bug in libata, I guess, as 
when using the siimage.c ide driver, already the first cat gives me 
maximum throughoutput. I am using 2.6.5-mm4 based kernel. Filesystems 
were mounted/ I didn't change anything between first and secound cat.
bye,
Prakash
