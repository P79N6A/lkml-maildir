What is the output of 'lspci -v'? If it says that the chip revision is '78' then
this is one of the new 3C905CX (note the CX) NIC's or ASIC on the motherboard.
I've seen a problem with the 3c59x.c driver and this chip, it can send packets
but not receive any. The 3Com 3c90x-1.0.0i.tgz driver at
http://support.3com.com/infodeli/tools/nic/linux.htm
 should work with this chip.
There has been some discussion of this NIC on the vortex mailing list at
http://www.scyld.com/network/vortex.html
 , with a patched driver to make for
this chip available for testing at Andrew's web site
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/#3c59x-bc
 (see the '2.2.19pre2 driver for
testing').
