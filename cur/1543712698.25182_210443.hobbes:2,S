Hello Andrew,
We faced this problem starting 2.6.3 while working on kexec. 
The problem is because we now initialize cpu_vm_mask for init_mm with 
CPU_MASK_ALL (from 2.6.3 onwards) which makes all bits in cpumask 1 (on SMP). 
Hence BUG_ON(!cpus_equal(cpumask,tmp) fails. The change to set
cpu_vm_mask to CPU_MASK_ALL was done to remove tlb flush optimizations 
for ppc64. 
I had posted a patch for this in the earlier thread. Reposting the same
here. This patch removes the assertion and uses "tmp" instead of cpumask. 
Otherwise, we will end up sending IPIs to offline CPUs as well.
Comments please.
Regards, Hari
