Subject: Bug report for linux-2.6.0-test7: System crashes when I try to start my software raid

Hi!
Today I wanted to give 2.6.0 a try on my fileserver. It's got a software 
raid (md - no evms) with 11*120GB IDE. When I tried to start it 
(raidstart /dev/md0) my system crashed badly. It didnt react to anything 
but magic sysreq. The last thing I could see was an (incomplete) stack 
trace. Incomplete beacause scrollback didn't work anymore. It looks like 
the crashes didn't trash my data or raid headers.
I can reproduce the bug - it happens everytime when I try to start my raid.
I already tried to disable DMA - didn't help. The system worked fine for 
over a year with 2.4.x kernels. Currently I run 2.4.22_pre2-gss (a 
gentoo flavour).
I am willing to help anyone who wants to fix this as good as I can. This 
includes giving informations,  testing, etc... just contact me.
If there's a better place than this list for posting this report, please 
tell me.
Thanks for helping,
Thomas Kleffel
