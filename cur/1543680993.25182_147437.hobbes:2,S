That's fine.  The problem is, does this completely starve the other
tasks such as kswapd, ksoftirqd, bash etc.?
The real problem is can a user accidentally or malicious lock up a box
using SCHED_SOFTRR (when xmms, xine, GNU software radio and modem are
all using it :), and also what about multi-user boxes, can two users
accidentally break it.
Perhaps there should be a _global_ maximum amount of CPU used in
SCHED_SOFTRR beyond which SCHED_SOFTRR tasks get downgraded.
