Thanks for your pointed out.
I didn't know the macro, but it is suitable for my purpose.
I'll replace it on the next submitting.

The entries under capability/names have its private data as integer value,
stored in kobj_attribute->data declared as void *.
One idea is casting it to 'unsigned long' and using "%ld" as the format.
I believe it is correct assumption that long type and pointers have
same width in the linux kernel. Please tell me, if it is wrong.
