Hi,
I'm currently running 2.5.3-dj3 with the "fix for inodes with wrong item versions" and got the following errors in dmesg:
vs-825: reiserfs_get_block: [283508 198 0x19001 UNKNOWN] should not be found
[many times]
and after a while:
vs-825: reiserfs_get_block: [799572 866493 0x3001 UNKNOWN] should not be found
[many times]
What does this mean?
