But since this is a 2.5 kernel, now is the time to change it, but you must
_also_ change the IOP version in lvm.h to 12 (not 11!) if you change the
struct sizes.
Sadly, I think the work that was done in the past to support user tools
for multiple IOP versions was dropped from (or never added to) the LVM
build process, so it will not just be a matter of "install the latest
user tools and all will be well", sigh.  We had this problem with the
change from IOP6 to IOP10, and had fixed it all up, but we are doomed
to repeat the same problem over again.
Cheers, Andreas
