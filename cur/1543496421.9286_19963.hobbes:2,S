Hi,
	I have a Sun Ultra/10 here (IDE drive) running RH-6.0 2.2.5 and an
rm on a large file takes a _really_ long time to return and other I/O's on
the disk don't return till the rm is done either (or at least till after
a really long time). So maybe it's an IDE only problem. I have a PC with
SCSI (BusLogic) and IDE at home, I'll try it here tonight.
	Marc
