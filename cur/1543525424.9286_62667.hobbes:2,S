I've recently become aware that some companies looking to adopt Linux into 
their organization are using existing code-review processes to "get 
acquainted" with LInux.  Unlike the commercial vendors, Linux is available 
in source form so it becomes possible to use it.
Now, the procedures for code review vary all over the block.  My experience 
with code review practices over the past 30 years indicates that very 
little attention would be paid to  expletives, unless the evaluator was 
VERY easily offended (rare in big business).  Attention will be paid 
instead to the quality of the code (which is good), quality of the comments 
(which is all over the block), and the quality and quantity of the external 
documentation (which the CoriolisOpen series is being identified as one 
such source of external documentation.)
There is also the problem of the perception by the evaluators of the Linux 
community and its ability to "support the product" -- IBM has seen the 
light, but other companies are having problems believing that the 
development and support method is really going to work.  How many of them, 
for example, are aware that the linux-kernel list even exists?
What code evaluators want to see is professionalism.  Dirty words (in 
moderation) doesn't detract from professionalism.
If anyone asked for my recommendation (and no one has, so you can stop 
reading this now) my suggestion would be to improve the quality and 
accuracy of comments.  In particular, when you do something that would look 
strange to an "average" person who has been coding C for five years, and 
you have a damn good reason for coding it in exactly that way, drop a short 
comment explaining what you are doing, and why.  The rationale for this 
suggestion is simple:  the second-rate coders that usually get stuck with 
code review aren't system-level people, and rarely do they know assembler 
well, let along how to read GNU assembler.
The bad news is that adding comments will increase the bloat of the kernel 
source even more, which makes it tougher on people with PSTN modems who 
wish to download the source.  That just means that adding comments should 
be done with thought.
Finally, this observation:  by putting the source out there under the GNU 
copyleft, we are BEGGING the suits to read our code.  Now, the majority of 
the suits (marketeers, executives, salesmen, bean counters) won't take the 
time, but the ENGINEERING suits will...and do.  In other words, the 
management most likely to read our code are the ones who are used to the, 
er, attitudes of the gear-heads and propeller-heads.
Bottom line:  GOOD comments, and try to keep it at or under R-rated.
