the lowlatency patch has the potential to trigger various races within the
kernel much more agressively. For the 'stuck process' case you first have
to check out at which EIP the process is stuck:
hell:~> ps -elnf | more
  F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR    SZ  WCHAN TTY          TIME CMD
100 S     0     1     0  0  60   0    -   274 139331 ?        00:00:02 init
take the 'WCHAN' field and add '0xc0' in front of it: 0xc0139331. Then
look this EIP up in your System.map. Hopefully it will be some meaningful
place, not a generic one like sleep_on(). If this does not help then you
might need the IKD patch-collection's stuck-process-oopser feature.
