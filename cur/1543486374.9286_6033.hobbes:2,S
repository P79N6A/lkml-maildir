Hi,
	I'm running a pII 400 with 256Mb of ram with a vanilla 2.2.1 kernel
Im trying to create a raid5 array with 4 9gig scsi seagate cheetah drives
connected to the external adapter of  an adaptec 2940uw controller. My os
drive is also a 9gig scsi cheetah on the internal ultra scsi adapter. I
have no scsi2 devices at all. I have verified proper termination and turned
off the auto term in the adaptec bios. 
Now I have no problems with mkraid, mdadd, or mdrun. All of these raid tools
report no errors. The problem comes when i try to format /dev/md0
my syntax is 
mkfs.ext2 /dev/md0
mkfs gets almost halfway through writing the inode tables and then i get
this output
Writing inode tabels: 1969/3254
Out of Memory for mkfs.ext2
Killed
and i am taken back to my command prompt
I have tried this several times with the same result. I have even went into
the scsi utilities and verified the media on each drive. Has anyone else
seen this problem, or am I just incompetent?:)
