I'm happy to say my experience has been better, when swraid was a patch I
built a kernel:
-rw-r--r--   1 root       763429 Dec 14  1999 k2.2.13s3r
And set up a four drive RAID-0+1. It has recovered from every problem with
nothing more that a hot add. You certainly have had bad luck, but I don't
think it's typical.
The situation when a drive fails and the system stays up seems to be
pretty good, back in the days of 340MB IDE drives I tested it more than I
wanted;-) As you note, recovery if the system goes down is somewhat
painful and manual.
