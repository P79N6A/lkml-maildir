You proved absolutely nothing, you cannot prove anything without
evidence. That's how these things work. It could be a driver issue of

Ok, so Justins aic7xxx I'm thinking. scgcheck reports residual bug with
the sym driver as well, I'll take a look at it.

Agree

It's an internal flag and it does exist. I'll add the flag to block sg.
