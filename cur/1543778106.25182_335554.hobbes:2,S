Yes, I am sure that it is not a simple problem.  I am not a kernel developer
but I imagine that issues such as NTP adjustments would complicate this
issue.  I must also admit that I am not intimately familiar with the POSIX
spec regarding itimers.
Our current code does a setitimer followed by getitimer, then uses the
actual interval retrieved by getitimer to set a global timer delta.  On each
timer signal, it updates the notion of the current time by the timer delta. 
As mentioned, this works on every other platform (Solaris, BSD, HPUX, AIX,
DGUX, IRIX, Tru64, and Linux up to 2.6.11) but breaks on 2.6.12.
This is not an insurmountable problem for userspace.  It can be easily
solved by using gettimeofday in the timer interrupt instead of adding the
delta to the current time blindly.  No big deal.  I just wanted to point
this issue out and ensure that (1) it was a known issue, and (2) it is the
direction that the Linux kernel intends to take.  If so, no big deal and we
can modify the timer code to take that into account.
