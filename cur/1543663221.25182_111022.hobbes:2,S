Read the comments in .../linux-n.n/include/linux/tty.h and then
modify NR_PTYS accordingly. You need to add more majors as well.
Note that ptys are used for interactive terminals, you don't need
one for every network connection. You may be adding something that
you don't need and wasting kernel space.
