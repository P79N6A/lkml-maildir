In order to clear things up I should clearly state that my rsync
problem manifests itself under local operation. Ie., 'rsync -arv
linux-242p4/ linux' will hang. No network is involved and the
problem does not manifest itself under 2.2.X kernels with the
exact same dataset.
Also, I have played around with strace and discovered that if I
make strace follow the children too the hang goes away. So
'strace rsync -arv linux-242p4/ linux' hangs (in wait4, btw)
while 'strace -f rsync -arv linux-242p4/ linux' does not.
I hope this will mean something to somebody. I can put up
strace output on the net if anybody profess any interest.
