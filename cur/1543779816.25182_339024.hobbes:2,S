hai,
    I have written a daemon which is running in user space, will send some 
data periodically to kernel space. This I have done with the help of a 
device file.
  It is working, but I want to apply threads mechanism in that daemon. But 
when I split that daemon functionality into a thread and a original 
process. I am unable to 
open the device file. This is happening in both places(either in thread or 
original process).
The device is opening  when threading is not there.
Can anybody suggest me?
Regards,
P.Manohar.
