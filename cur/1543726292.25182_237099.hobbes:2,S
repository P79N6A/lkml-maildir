The latest findutils package I can find is version 4.1.20, and its most
recent ChangeLog entry is dated 2001-06-09.
It doesn't have this feature of find not stat'ing the regular files, but
using dirent d_type instead.
I also found a March 2004 thread presenting a patch to use d_type, at:
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-findutils/2004-03/msg00004.html
But the thread seemed to end inconclusively, after just a few messages
discussing various alternative implementations of some stuff.
Ulrich - could you provide a clue where to find a find that does what
you describe?
