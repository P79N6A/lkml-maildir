Well, I suspect that David referred to a commit that he just sent by 
email. Which obviously will have a *different* commit ID once you commit 
it - so it probably made sense in his tree, but not once he exported it 
as an email instead of syncing with git natively. 
I also suspect that the whole series was re-ordered in email (or by you 
reading/applying them in a different order). Since now the revert of the 
"disable MSI" happens *before* the patch that looks like it will fix the 
issue.
So I think David also probably didn't number his patches.
