I have no problem on SUSE 10.0 (2.16.91.0.2-8) or SLES9 (2.15.90.0.1.1-32.10) 
which are both far older than a year.  Both produce good looking
vdso.sos.
sles8 (2.12.90.0.15; it was really one of the first production
binutils for x86-64) doesn't work out of the box (looks like as-instr doesn't 
work anymore and it has another assembler issue I'll fix) 
but with that workarounded it also builds a reasonble looking vdso
Sam, can you please take a look at the as-instr issue? It seems
to succeed now when it should fail.
It would be useful if someone could find out which binutils versions
really not work.
