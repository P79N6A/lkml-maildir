Sorry I had about 5 minutes to do something when this issue
came up and unfortunately I knew how to solve it cleanly :(
So I wrote the patch.  It was my hope that by putting it into
-mm I could sucker someone with some time into doing fixing
the architectures that broke.
I think what we want is one of the too patches below.  Basically
something that just sets pm_power_off to a non NULL value is
enough to continue the alphas current behaviour.

Disagreeing in saying it didn't quite go far enough pm_power_off
should be initialized on alpha.

That is a good point.  But I really don't want to see a fix that
just blindly fixes a build issue.  When it takes about 10 minutes
to audit machine_power_off and see what really needs to be done.
To that extent I have hacked up your patch two different ways
one of them should be usable.  I'm just not certain which non-zero
initializer I like better.  The second setting pm_power_off to
machine_power_off is what the powerpc port currently does.
