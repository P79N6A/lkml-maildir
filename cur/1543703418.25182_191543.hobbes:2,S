Hello,
I am sorry for the long delay, I ran completely out of time unfortunately.
In short:
You are right, there is no regression between .23 and .24, shoot me.
Anyway I know there was a former kernel that worked with ACPI on this board.
I wanted to return the info which one though, but don't have it yet.
Anyway as soon as I find some spare time I will go hunting...
Regards,
Stephan
