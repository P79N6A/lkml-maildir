indeed, good catch - could you check whether the patch below fixes this? 
I also pushed this out into x86.git#testing, which you can pick up via:
       
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/x86.git/README

correct - these are never supposed to be 'true', generally allocated RAM 
pages - or like we do with AGP where the pages are exclusively owned we 
restore their cacheability explicitly.

yes, the biggest constraint from ioremap comes when it applies to pages 
that are mapped by the kernel. But i guess we could extend this to all 
things RAM ... the second patch below does this. What do you think? I've 
queued this up in x86.git#testing as well.

i removed the WARN_ON_ONCE() from x86.git a few days ago, it's lined up 
for the next push.

Jan Beulich noticed that if a driver's ioremap() fails (say due to -ENOMEM)
then we might leak the struct vm_area - free it properly.
