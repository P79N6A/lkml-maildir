Hmm.. That's not always true in general, since Sign-off does allow to sign
off on other peoples patches (see the "(b)" clause in DCO), but maybe in
the ALSA tree it is.
Are you coming from a CVS tree or what? It's clearly not my patch 
applicator thing, since that one removes spaces, I'm pretty sure.
