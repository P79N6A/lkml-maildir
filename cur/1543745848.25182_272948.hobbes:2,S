I have been trying to track down why all attempts to burn a cd on my ide cdrw 
fails (see bug #3741 on bugzilla ), with a subprocess of cdrecord ending up 
hanging in uninterruptable sleep state.
I think I understand what is happening, I just don't know what to do about it.
Inside drivers/ide/ide-cd.c
the ide_do_rw_cdrom routine has been called via a request with the request 
flags having the REQ_BLOCK_PC flag set.  The request->data_len of this 
request is set to 0.
This request is sent to the device and it generates interrupts to eventually 
land it up inside the routine cdrom_newpc_intr.
At this point the status register on the hardware is set to 0x58 - implying, I 
think that the DRQ_STAT bit is set and that something should be sent to the 
device.
Normally, because the requested data_len is not zero, the data is sent.  In 
this case however, because the original request had nothing to send, the 
while/if clauses to initiate a new transfer are skipped and the routine ends 
up setting a new interrupt handler address and returning to await an 
interrupt that will never come.
Question: should something validate that the request length is not zero 
earlier, or should there be a check in ide-cd.c, or is it my hardware (its a 
generic cd read/rewriter which announces itself as 'CW078D CD-R/RW')
