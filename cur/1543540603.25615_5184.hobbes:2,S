The RSA patent doesn't expire until Sept 20th.  We still have 49 days, 7
hours and 39 minutes to go. :)
As far as a BSafe equiv, check out 
http://www.openssl.org
.
"The OpenSSL crypto library implements a wide range of cryptographic
algorithms used in various Internet standards. The services provided by
this library are used by the OpenSSL implementations of SSL, TLS and
S/MIME, and they have also been used to implement SSH, OpenPGP, and other
cryptographic standards."
