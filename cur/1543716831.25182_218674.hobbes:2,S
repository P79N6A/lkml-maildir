+ debugging firmware?
	
	Maybe. But the point I had in mind is, say for example
memory diagnostics applications/exercisers which reads (Blind
reads, without caring about contents) memory
to uncover errors (single bit errors)  can use
this to know the usable ranges and map them thru /dev/mem and
read those ranges.
+ 
+ 2) Can the memory map output ever be larger than PAGE_SIZE (lower
+ limit is 4KB on x86)?  If not, what guarantees that?  If so, you need
+ your own read mechanism rather than the generic sysfs one.
+ 
	I don't have an answer right now. I'll investigate. Tony Luck also 
expressed similar concerns and suggested seq*() interfaces. I'll see
how I can do that.
+ The one-value-per-file rule has an exception for an array of values of
+ the same type per Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt, which this
+ looks to adhere to.
+ 
+ Thanks,
+ Matt
