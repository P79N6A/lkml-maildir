   If it wants THOSE, it is asking for wrong abstraction layer 
   information.
   No userspace program (beside of special sysadmin tools) should
   be poking into PROC_FS.  The NET interface abstraction is already
   wrapped inside  libc.

   Good software gives clear diagnostics if some necessary facility
   is missing at runtime.
