No, thank *you*!  Here I thought I was the only one...
As a low-life out-of-tree maintainer, I would like to plead for at
least a mitigation of the pain of constantly changing kernel/module
APIs.  I realize that an interface freeze is out of the question, but
how about a more formal and regularized way of flagging changes.  The
nasty mess of version checking works (I guess) but it would sure be
nice to have change flags that were actually tied to the changes
themselves.  Consistently.
(And taking my drivers main-line isn't an option.  It would be fine
with me, but there is *zero* chance that my funky code would be
welcomed into the tree.)
Thanks,
Bill (donning asbestos shorts...)
