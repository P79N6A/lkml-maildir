BTW, that IS a very good idea and It Should Be Done By Make. It's good
enough for 90% of the cases I can imagine, _provided_ that you can
identify the image, i.e. that the lilo/whatever config hasn't changed.
That's the problem. Imagine giving the instructions over the phone, blind
(and in a foreign language, as I often do, to someone with a regional accent
who thinks _you_ speak funny, and who usually turns the lights on and
off).  Whereas the stuff in proc would be a tease.
