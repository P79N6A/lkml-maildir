You don't say it, but I assume you are hoking into a input firewall chain.

On input time the skb carries an input route which points to the local
delivery function. If you call skb->output on input again you'll get an
endless recursion which will quickly fill up the kernel stack and crash
the machine.

You have to generate a correct header (with ICMP header, correct destination
and source address based on the original packet, payload), then look up the
output route for it (using ip_route_output). See icmp.c for an example. I assume
you want to spoof ICMP echo replies, please be advised that this is generally
a bad idea (and do not even think about doing the same thing for TCP!)

http://www.uk.linux.org/Documents/buffers.html
 has a basic introduction, but
for the kind of stuff you seem to want to do you'll need to do RTFS. Perhaps
the SF source will be helpful (
