The problem is that it's not a race in who gets to do its thing first, but a 
parallel reader can actually see a corrupted value from the two independent 
words on 32bit (e.g. during a 4GB). And this could actually completely corrupt 
f_pos when it happens with two racing relative seeks or read/write()s
I would consider that a bug.
Fixes would be either to always take a spinlock to update this (nasty on 
platforms where spinlocks are expensive like P4) or define some architecture
specific way to read/write 64bit values consistently. In theory also some
lazy locking seqlock like mechanism could be used, but that had the disadvantage
of being theoretically starvable.
