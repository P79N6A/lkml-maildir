Ok, so you saved what, 200 bytes? On a few drivers that may save you a
small amount -- you basically said you had to have everything loaded to
see 5K.
Weren't most of those savings from moving a big function out-of-line?
The part I agree with?

Quit being dense. No one has said that there are cases will it make a
difference, just that that case is far removed from the usual case.
I think I'm done on this topic. You've got more important people to
convince than me, and they've already clear stated their position.
