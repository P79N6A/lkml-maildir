I dont take the mail list dist just answer here in and i will see the
answer.
The problem
I thought
echo "scsi log all" >/proc/scsi/scsi 
would turn on kernel scsi logging and put some notification line
in /var/log/messages
indicating scsi logging was now active at such and such a level
that is not happening and I have a external drive connected via
usb talking scsi that cannot be unmounted and i need to trace
scsi action so I can post here.
any help would be appreciated.
