Subject: MLOCK_LIMIT needs PAGE_SIZE

commit 448580132dc7f55493269bb850c2955df9c7d778 in Aug 2004 changed
MLOCK_LIMIT from (32*1024) to (8 * PAGE_SIZE):
        [PATCH] sane mlock_limit
        As David M-T points out, the default per-user mlock limit should
        be at least a single page.
linux/resource.h appears to be a userspace header. PAGE_SIZE is
unavailable because asm/page.h is not included.
Will an extra #include asm/page.h cause any trouble for kernel builds?
It currently gets included via linux/time.h -> linux/seqlock.h ->
linux/spinlock.h -> something.
Userspace PAGE_SIZE will be discussed in another mail.
