Care to name one? What exactly is the rule you see broken? Sure you can build
loops, but you cannot prevent people from doing braindamaged things to their
data anyway. You would not ban dd either for being able to flatten your
harddisk only because of one mistyping char...
Every feature can be misused and then damaging, but that is no real reason not
to have it - IMHO.
