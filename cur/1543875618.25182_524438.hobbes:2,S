I'm not using an initrd, most of my kernel is builtin,
just a few modules for occasional filesystems.
CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_SCSI=y
CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC=y
CONFIG_SCSI_WAIT_SCAN=m
2.6.21-rc5-mm2 VFS panics unable to find my root on /dev/sda2,
but boots okay if I change drivers/scsi/Kconfig to "default y"
instead of "default m" for SCSI_WAIT_SCAN.
I'm sure that's not the right fix, but I don't know what is.
I've had no trouble with SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC=y until now: I could
turn it off, but others may have trouble with the same regression.
Hugh
