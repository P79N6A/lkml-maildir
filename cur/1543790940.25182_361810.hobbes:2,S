Any pseudo direct map will produce the behaviour.
It behaves as if the ghost option was not specified even when it has. 
This is because the altered test for an empty directory is always 
returning true even though the directory isn't empty.
I'm still trying to understand why this happens. In theory it's just not 
the expected behaviour. I must be missing something in the directory 
creation. I've been here before and looked several times and I just can't 
see why it happens this way.
