It probably is, although I suspect it should just be a default action, and 
drivers can choose to implement their own "suspend()" functionality if 
they want to.

I would strongly encourage letting the device hierarchy suspend() (now
called sysfs, not driverfs) call be the _only_ call the disk controller
ever gets. Having two different suspend mechanisms is just too confusing
for words, and there's no point.
