The good news is that git itself doesn't really care. I think it's
literally _one_ function ("get_sha1_filename()") that you need to change,
and then you need to write a small script that moves files around, and
you're really much done.
Also, I did actually debate that issue with myself, and decided that even
if we do have tons of files per directory, git doesn't much care. The
reason? Git never _searches_ for them. Assuming you have enough memory to
cache the tree, you just end up doing a "lookup", and inside the kernel
that's done using an efficient hash, which doesn't actually care _at_all_
about how many files there are per directory.
So I was for a while debating having a totally flat directory space, but 
since there are _some_ downsides (linear lookup for cold-cache, and just 
that "ls -l" ends up being O(n**2) and things), I decided that a single 
fan-out is probably a good idea.

Hey, I may end up being wrong, and yes, maybe I should have done a 
two-level one. The good news is that we can trivially fix it later (even 
dynamically - we can make the "sha1 object tree layout" be a per-tree 
config option, and there would be no real issue, so you could make small 
projects use a flat version and big projects use a very deep structure 
etc). You'd just have to script some renames to move the files around..
