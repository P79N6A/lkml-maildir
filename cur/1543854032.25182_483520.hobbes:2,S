Ooops! sorry missed that one. Its the 2.6.19-rc5-mm2. Its having the
same .config which i posted on the bugzilla. Do you want the acpidump
again?

Hold on, so let me get it right. When i do an echo 1596000 >
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_setspeed, the cpu cores
will still be running at 1.86 Ghz since the other core is at that
frequency? In this situation how do I then change the frequency?
Thanks
