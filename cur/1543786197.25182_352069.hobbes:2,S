It is. Just get the "id" file that is associated with a snapshot, and it 
gives the git commit ID for that state.
So for example, the 2.6.14-rc1-git3 snapshot is associated with the ID 
file patch-2.6.14-rc1-git3.id, which contains 
	v2.6/snapshots(0)$ cat patch-2.6.14-rc1-git3.id
	065d9cac98a5406ecd5a1368f8fd38f55739dee9
so once you know that something broke between rc1-git3 and rc1-git4, you 
can now do
	git bisect start
	git bisect good 065d9cac98a5406ecd5a1368f8fd38f55739dee9
	git bisect bad bc5e8fdfc622b03acf5ac974a1b8b26da6511c99
and off you go..
