I'd prefer pci_io_start() and pci_io_check_err()
The names should have "pci" in them.
I don't like "ioerr_clear" because it implies we are clearing the 
io error; we are not; we are clearing the checker for io errors.

Do we really need a cookie?

Yes, they should be no-ops. save/resotre interrupts would be a bad idea.
