    It's not exactly "kernel-based fsck". What I've been talking about
    is secondary filesystem providing coherent access to primary fs
    metadata.  I.e. mount -t ext2meta -o master=/usr none /mnt and
    then access through /mnt/super, /mnt/block_bitmap, etc.
Call me stupid --- but what exactly does the above actually achieve?
Why would you do this?
