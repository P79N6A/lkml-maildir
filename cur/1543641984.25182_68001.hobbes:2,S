do you see the conflict between your two statements?
if it's a "semi-realtime" process that needs more CPU time and needs it
sooner than other 'unimportant' processes in the system like httpd or
remote shells, then give it a higher priority.
under the O(1) scheduler this will now do something meaningful. Yes, this
needs root privileges, otherwise it could be abused to lift priority and
effectively lock out eg. the root shell.
under the old scheduler the nice levels were just a rough mechanism to
determine how CPU hogs use the CPU - interactiveness-wise it did not make
a big difference.
but, i have a spare plan for this, mentioned previously: to enable
unprivileged processes to lower their priority to -5 if they want to.
Could you please test your game server, does it feel interactive enough at
-5?
(allowing -10 might be too much of a stretch.)
