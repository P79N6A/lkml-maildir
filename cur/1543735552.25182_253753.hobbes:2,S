The whole section should be run with interrupts disabled,
so disabling preemption should be trivial.
Beyond this the code needs a bogomips based timeout, (we can't use external
time sources just the delay loop).  Any of the other cpu's could have
crashed at this point, or our accounting data structures could be
currupt.
Putting the initial call inside of machine_kexec is also bogus.
crash_machine_kexec needs to call crash_stop_cpus and then
machine_kexec.  machine_kexec is currently factored as a perfectly
reusable piece of code let's not mess that up.
