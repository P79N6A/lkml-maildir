Nice 2.7 material, and parts I've always wanted to work on. (Including
making the entire partition scanning user-space on top of DM too.)
KS material?

And then add all the other stuff, like scenarios where half of your RAID
is "somewhere" on the network via nbd, iSCSI or whatever and all the
other possible stackings... Definetely user-space material, and partly
because it /needs/ to have the input from the volume managers to do the
sane things.
The point about this implying that the superblock parsing/updating logic
needs to be duplicated between userspace and kernel land is valid too
though, and I'm keen on resolving this in a way which doesn't suck...
