i had a patch integrating the iodesc idea, but after some thought, had
decided to call it struct file_io.  That name reflects the fact that
it's doing I/O in arbitrary lengths with byte offsets, and struct
file_io *fio contrasts well with struct bio (block_io).  I also had
used the field ->nbytes instead of ->count, to clarify the difference
between segment iterators, segment offsets, and absolute bytecount.
FYI, the patch is still in the works and would convert the whole file
I/O stack to use the new structure.  I would like to base it off of
this work as well if this makes it into -mm (as I think it should)
