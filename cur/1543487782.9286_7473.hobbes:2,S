If you are controlling nuclear power stations, software bugs are not your
only problem.
For #2, I think that something could be done something like this
Break the mp3 output into 
         Get a Mp3 block; break it into rt segments; send segments to device
The first two parts can run under standard linux. What would be nice
is a feature like:
launch_rtl(put_segment,rtfifo_mp3, blocksize,period);
while(data_input)
    {
     break into segments and do whatever else preprocessing can be done
     write to rtfifo /* this blocks when queu is too full */
     } /* perhaps rtl_put_sound also causes this process to run at a
          high priority when the queue is small or even dynamically
          adjusts this process priority by queue size as in Synthesis */
     
Does this fit the MP3 problem?
