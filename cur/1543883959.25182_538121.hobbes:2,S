To exploit the hole you need CAP_SYS_RAWIO which is the highest
capability of all. CAP_SYS_RAWIO gives you the ability to access hardware
directly so since it checks for CAP_SYS_RAWIO it isn't security.
The patch isn't wrong however and adds some sanity checking so it would
do no harm to send it to Andrew for -mm testing.
