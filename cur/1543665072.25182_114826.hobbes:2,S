Of course the numbers as well as comments on the inactive or unused 
entries could be added, just as they are today.  I had also considered 
the possiblility of adding the system call proto type as a parameter 
in the macro.  This could lead to a rather complete one entry 
description of the call.
Still, it seems to not be in favor, so I will let it drop.
