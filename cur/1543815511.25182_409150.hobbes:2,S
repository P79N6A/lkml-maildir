Yes.
In that case, the lockup is most probably really the PCI bus locking up 
due to some device not answering. Not a whole lot of debugging help from 
the kernel on things like that - you won't be able to get any information 
out of the system without a hardware reset which also tends to clear all 
memory ;(

Likely no. Not a lot to do but trying to figure out why the -mm tree works 
for you (if I recall correctly) by checking which patch breaks things..

Yup, narrowing down where exactly things go south is the way to do it.
