SATA-II is a highly confusing marketing term.  It is /not/ a technical
term.
In some cases there are NO differences between SATA-I and SATA-II.  You
can find 1.5Gbps non-NCQ-supporting devices claiming SATA-II.
Similarly, there is no "SATA version" word in the IDENTIFY DEVICE page,
like there are "ATA version" words.
