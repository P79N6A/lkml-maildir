shrink_mmap() is the obvious place.  The biggest problem is that we will
need to export enough functionality to allow other filesystems to
hook their own data structures onto the page cache LRU list, so that
filesystem-specific caches can be reclaimed in the same shrink_mmap()
loop.

Think about the buffer cache too.  But yes, if we restrict this to page
cache pages, then a page dirty bit and a separate lru for those pages
will do for this.

The whole reason we need this is to avoid deadlocks.  If we don't have
it, we can deadlock if we have transactional filesystems --- it's pretty
much that simple.  It's not enough to detect deadlocks here, we really
do need to prevent them, and allowing for pre-reservation of pinned
pages is the simplest way to let that happen.

Absolutely.
