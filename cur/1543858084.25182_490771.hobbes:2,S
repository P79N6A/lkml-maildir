Ok, this should be fixed in the current -git tree now (which I pushed out 
already, but due to mirroring delays it might not be visible for a while). 
If you see the commit "[PATCH] fix SG_IO bio leak" by FUJITA Tomonori, you 
should have the fixed tree.
(Commit 77d172ce2719b5ad2dc0637452c8871d9cba344c to be precise).
Thanks for noticing,
		Linus
