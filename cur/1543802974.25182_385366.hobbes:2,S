On the subject of pcnet32 and the invalid vendor ID, you may find this 
interesting:

The user saw the correct vendor ID (AMD) in 2.4, but when upgrading to 
2.6, it changed to Trident.
I guess this is still likely to be a hardware bug, but it demonstrates 
that the Linux PCI layer has something to do with it (even if it is just 
triggering it somehow).
