Oh, I'm not even there yet ... just thinking about what cpusets needs
independantly to operate efficiently - I don't think cpus_allowed is efficient.
Whatever we call it, the resource management system definitely needs the 
ability to isolate a set of resources (CPUs, RAM) totally dedicated to
one class or group of processes. That's what I see as the main feature
of cpusets right now, though there may be other things there as well that
I've missed? At least that's the main feature I personally see a need for ;-)

Mmm. Looks like you're trying to do multiple CKRMs, one inside each cpuset,
right? Not sure that's the way I'd go, but maybe it makes sense.
The way I'm looking at it, which is probably wholly insufficient, if not
downright wrong, we have multiple process groups, each of which gets some 
set of resources. Those resources may be dedicated to that class (a la 
cpusets) or not. One could view this as a set of resource groupings, and
set of process groupings, where one or more process groupings is bound to
a resource grouping.
The resources are cpus & memory, mainly, in my mind (though I guess IO,
etc fit too). The resource sets are more like cpusets, and the process
groups a bit more like CKRM, except they seem to overlap (to me) when
the sets in cpusets are non-exclusive, or when CKRM wants harder performance
guarantees.
Feel free to point out where I'm full of shit / missing the point ;-)
