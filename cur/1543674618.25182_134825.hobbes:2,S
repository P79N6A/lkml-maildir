Yes it does.  "Move the PCI core to start..." describes exactly this
portion of the patch.  We have to change from device_register() to
device_add() if we want to grab a reference count on the pci device
before we register it with the driver core.  Which we do want to do,
because of the two stage process of creating and registering pci
devices.

CodingStyle doesn't _explicitly_ say that this is not allowed :)
I'll fix it next set of pci patches...

Just being safe.  We can drop it if it really annoys you, but other
subsystems do the same thing.
