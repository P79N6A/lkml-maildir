The version I just released does exactly that.  Well, not exactly; it
actually looks at fstab -- /proc/mounts gives you '/dev/root' rather
than a physical device name in the root entry.

No.  It only knows about IDE and SCSI root devices at the moment.  As I 
learn how to identify other kinds of root volume it will get smarter.
