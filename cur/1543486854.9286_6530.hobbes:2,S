I think the big attraction to the userfs solution was that the protocol
was very simple and it was trivial to add new filesystems. From what I
recall NFS isnt exactly a trivial protocol and people doing nfs<->userfs
could find it rather intimidating and confusing.
In the CDROM-XA situation though, its probably better to add support for
it in the ISO9660 driver directly as it doesnt require a new filesystem,
just detect Mode2 sectors and deal with them properly.
