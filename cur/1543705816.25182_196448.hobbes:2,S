I have same problems since of 2.6.0, now I running 2.6.2 stock kernel
I run XFree86-4.3.0 and still with problems, anyone try XFree86-4.4.0 devel snapshots???
I try kernel with/without  preempty/acpi/apic make all possibilities, 
then may be error is not in kernel, but in XFree86-4.3.0 which not support big changes in input system
of 2.6.x, I tried compile XFree86 with linux-2.6.{0,1,2} kernel headers was 100% fail, sounds binary 
and source incompatibilites,  
Thanks in advance
