Thank you for the background!  It has been quite some time since I
did significant embedded work.  Let's just say that I am glad that
"embedded CPU" no longer means "8-bit CPU"!  ;-)

Good points.  Suppose there was a way to get the hard realtime benefits
using a slight elaboration of this approach that worked on single-core,
single-threaded CPUs?  Would that be of interest?

Agreed, if you are going for the ultimate in response time, you have
no choice but to run hand-coded assembly language on bare metal (though
optimizing compilers are improving, so maybe it will soon be hand-coded
C on bare metal).  If you are using your computer to digitally modulate
and synthesize a USA FM radio signal (around 100MHz carrier frequency),
you certainly are not going to have anything resembling an OS involved.
You will have nothing but a tight loop running flat out, assuming that
even today's general-purpose CPUs are fast enough to accomplish this.
So, I guess the question is whether 100-microsecond restricted hard
realtime support in Linux is worth the effort.  From what you are saying,
it sounds like the answer is currently "no" if it requires multithreaded
CPUs or multicore dies.
So, again, if there was a way to make this approach work on
single-threaded single core CPUs, would that be of interest?
					Thanx, Paul
