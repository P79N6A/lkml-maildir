This is very very bad.
It's a uniprocessor machine, yes?
Could you describe the workload a bit more?  Is it something which others
can get their hands on?
It spends a lot of time in the kernel for a build system.  I wonder why.
At a guess I'd say either a) you're hitting some path in the kernel which
is going for a giant and bogus romp through memory, trashing CPU caches or
b) your workload really dislikes run-child-first-after-fork or c) the page
allocator is serving up pages which your access pattern dislikes or d)
something else.
It's certainly interesting.
