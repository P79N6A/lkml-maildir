Subject: ide problems: 2.6.22-git17 working, 2.6.23-rc1* is not

I have a via mini-itx epia 5000 motherboard as a firewall.
It has an ide device: PQI 128MB flash DOM [1] which just plugs
directly into the ide connector on the motherboard.
2.6.22-git17 works, although it gives some warning 
hda: set_drive_speed_status: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: set_drive_speed_status: error=0x04 { DriveStatusError }
Full dmesg output [2]
When i compiled any 2.6.23-rc1 kernel out so far it always froze on me.
Yesterday i tried 2.6.23-rc1-git3 and i booted until:
VP_IDE: VIA vt8231 (rev 10) IDE UDMA100 controller on pci0000:00:11.1
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xd000-0xd007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xd008-0xd00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
Marking TSC unstable due to: possible TSC halt in C2.
Time: acpi_pm clocksource has been installed.
hda: PQI IDE DiskOnModule, ATA DISK drive
hda: IRQ probe failed (0xfff2)
Clocksource tsc unstable (delta = 84358771493 ns)
So i went back to 2.6.22-git17.
This morning i saw a fresh git4 and compiled/installed that.
This kernel actually booted! (once)
I had a netconsole running to catch the lucky event [3]
After about 2 minutes of working however, the whole machine froze.
No message at the console, not able to toggle numlock, no magic
sysrq key features: solid frozen.
After the power cycle i was not able to boot the same kernel
ever again. It was just like a timer had run out and it wouldn't 
work anymore. 
I know my hardware is "ancient" and the flash thing is probably
not current. My firewall however is solar powerpowered (10 watt 
power consumption) and it would be fun if i could run the latest/
greatest kernels on it.
Config files and hdparm info on the DOM in the same directory as
dmesg output.
Any comments appriciated.
Danny
