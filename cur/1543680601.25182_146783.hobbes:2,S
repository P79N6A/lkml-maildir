What piece of code does prevent that?
As I see, OOM is triggered if no pages were freed in few loops. It
doesn't care about pages that are already being written or pages for which
write operation was started.
The only thing that prevents total oom when writing a lot of dirty pages
is blk_congestion_wait, but it's pretty unreliable because
1) it uses timeout
2) not all page writes go through block devices (NFS, NBD etc.)
blk_congestion_wait may be used for improving performance, but not for
ensuring stability.

I remember there was (and probably still is, only with smaller
probability) a similar bug in 2.2.
