This is my fault and I apologize.
Starting again from the beginning, Oracle table creates will create sparse
redo logs and database files, and then populate them sequentially.  A table
create can happen at any time, though it is arguably a rare occurrence
(some administrators have creates scripted to run nightly, others much
less).  Allocating memory to the page cache for these operations is
sub-optimal, since Oracle maintains its own cache layer.  The pages will
eventually need to be reaped, anyway, and this doesn't happen until there
is memory pressure.  I asked for performance numbers showing the impact of
this behaviour, and I'm working on producing some numbers here.  I'll
post the results when they are available.
So, how did this work in the past?  In kernels prior to 2.6.12,
generic_file_direct_IO looked like so:
	retval = mapping->a_ops->direct_IO(rw, iocb, iov,
					offset, nr_segs);
	if (rw == WRITE && mapping->nrpages) {
                int err = invalidate_inode_pages2(mapping);
	        if (err)
	                retval = err;
	}
If this was a write to a hole in a file, retval will be 0 and we fall back
to buffered I/O.  In this case, the invalidate_inode_pages2 call may not
invalidate any pages at all.  Here is the caller:
	if (unlikely(file->f_flags & O_DIRECT)) {
		written = generic_file_direct_write(iocb, iov,
				&nr_segs, pos, ppos, count, ocount);
		if (written < 0 || written == count)
			goto out;
		/*
		 * direct-io write to a hole: fall through to buffered I/O
		 * for completing the rest of the request.
		 */
		pos += written;
		count -= written;
	}
	written = generic_file_buffered_write(iocb, iov, nr_segs,
			pos, ppos, count, written);
Here, we end up populating the page cache.  Notice that, just like in
current kernels, there is no invalidation logic here.  The catch is that on
the next I/O to this file, all of the pages associated with the file will
be invalidated by the call to invalidate_inode_pages2 in
generic_file_direct_IO.  So, each I/O clears the page cache pages used by
the one before it.
In 2.6.12, the call to invalidate_inode_pages2 in generic_file_direct_IO was
changed to invalidate_inode_pages2_range:
		retval = mapping->a_ops->direct_IO(rw, iocb, iov,
						offset, nr_segs);
		if (rw == WRITE && mapping->nrpages) {
			pgoff_t end = (offset + write_len - 1)
						>> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT;
			int err = invalidate_inode_pages2_range(mapping,
					offset >> PAGE_CACHE_SHIFT, end);
			if (err)
				retval = err;
		}
So this means that we no longer invalidate the pages used by the previous
I/O.  This is the source of the regression.

I think it is expected that a direct I/O should not populate the page
cache.  I think your statement is correct for writes.  For reads, I don't
think we need to shoot down the page cache (we do a filemap_write_and_wait
on the mapping before issuing the I/O, so the on-disk copy should be up to
date).
The man page for open states:
       O_DIRECT
              Try to minimize cache effects of the I/O to and from this file.
I think that invalidating the page cache pages we use when falling back to
buffered I/O stays true to the above description.

I don't think it's a bizarre requirement that we invalidate the page cache
that we may have used while falling back to buffered I/O.

I'm sure I'm missing something.  But I think that if I can get a suitable
patch posted for this issue, then there is no further work needed.
Again, sorry that I didn't include a better description.  I've attached my
reproducer to this message.

'Sneaking' is certainly not my intention.  =)
