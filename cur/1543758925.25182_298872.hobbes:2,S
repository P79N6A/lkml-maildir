Greg,
Wouldn't this actually happen automatically simply by Linus switching
to being a lot more picky about whats accepted into an even release. I
agree that if it becomes too formal it could probably turn into an
unmaintainable mess. However, by simply making it a golden rule, then
developers can just continue pushing their patches and the people
above can just shift things to -mm that aren't deemed suitable for the
even release.
I think this would work quite well.
Cheers,
Jes
