I didn't have a second box available at first.  Then I blew close to 45
minutes trying to figure out why netconsole was totally failing to work,
before I found this in .config:
# CONFIG_NETCONSOLE is not set
"Do'h!" -- H. Simpson
Unfortunately, defining netconsole caused NETPOLL to be defined, which caused
a recompile of half the known world, and the symptoms of the crash moved.
Film at 11, once I figure out what's going on, and fix the testbed in my
office so I can actually catch this sucker - I may have to string a serial
cable.  One solid good data point:
21-rc5 with only the -mm4 'origin.patch' applied is OK, so whatever the
issue is, it's not in Linus's tree.
