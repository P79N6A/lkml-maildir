Trust me, the way git does things, you'll have so much redundancy that 
you'll have to really _work_ at losing data.
That's the good news.
The bad news is that this is obviously why it does eat a lot of disk. 
Since it saves full-file commits, you're going to have a lot of 
(compressed) full files around.
