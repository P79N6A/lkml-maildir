Hi,
Gcc 3.2 doesn't honours the regparm attribute for FASTCALL in
asm-i386/linkage.h
while compiling modules. It assumes regparm(0) instead of regparm(3) and
generates
incompatible code for modules. I have tried gcc 2.96-x and gcc 3.2. I
have upgraded my binutils.
Still the problem persists. Tried searching the Net for right gcc
version. But could not find any information. 
Could anyone send me some info on gcc and binutils versions?
Thanks in advance
Aravind
