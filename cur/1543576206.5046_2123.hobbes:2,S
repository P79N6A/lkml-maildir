Hi,
I found a way to crash an SMP 2.4-test11 kernel:
1. Create a BIG file (lets say about 300-400 MByte)
2. use losetup and the loop device to create an
   ext2 filesystem within the file
3. mount the file
4. copy huge amounts of data into the file.
   (for example copy your /usr directory into it.)
-> Kernel deadlocks after some time.
Could someone try to reproduce this behaviour ?
so long
  Ingo
