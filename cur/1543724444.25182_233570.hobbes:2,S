BTW, binutils 2.15 on ARM has other issues, which I've reported to
Nick Clifton/binutils-bug.  The assembler seems to produce extra
symbolic information in the form of symbols starting with '$', eg:
c0067860 T __fput
c0067860 t $a
c0067954 t $d
c0067958 T fget
c0067958 t $a
Not only do these symbols interfere with ld's error reporting, but
they also interfere with kallsyms - the backtrace information from
such a kernel is not very useful when it reports function names of
'$a':
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x6042c): In function `$a':
: relocation truncated to fit: R_ARM_PC24 .exit.text
Obviously not useful to anyone.
This seems to only affect binutils 2.15, so I think we should hang
fire on any work-arounds until the binutils folk have commented.
