so it does....I'm retarded. ;-)
Although I should still be able to build the kernel without pci support,
shouldn't I?
Where does the CONFIG_BIOS_FIXUP come from and is it necessary for a
device like this is I guess what I'm asking -  the code compiled in by
CONFIG_BIOS_FIXUP seems to depend on PCI being in but you can select it
without selecting PCI -  that's the underlying issue here I think.  I
assume I don't really need CONFIG_BIOS_FIXUP for this device (given the
name of the option, I would hope that this thing doesn't have a bios
that needs 'fixing
up') but I'm not even sure how to turn it off... and of course I'm only
guessing based on the error I got and the names of the things involved,
i haven't rolled up my sleeves and got into it yet..
