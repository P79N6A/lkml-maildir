I hope you can turn this on/off via /proc or at compile time.
There are situations where linux's old behavior is useful.
Example situation:
While setting up a test machine at a university, I was given an unassigned
IP. Somebody had happened to be using the IP though. Both machines were
NT, so they throw up a little message box telling you about the IP
conflict. The user whom had taken the IP, just kept clicking Ok, without
reading the error. After quite a few minutes of this, I brought up a linux
machine with the offending IP. In about 2 minutes, a call came into the
helpdesk reporting the error.
So linux's current behavior as far as duplicate IPs, can be handy.
If this new behavior, can be turned off via /proc, defaulting to catching
duplicates is not a bad thing. Maybe /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_conflict?
