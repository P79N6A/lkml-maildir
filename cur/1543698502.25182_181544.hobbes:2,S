Ok, setting CONFIG_NR_CPUS=8 does indeed solve the HT issue, looks like 
it was the numbering scheme:
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: CPU 0 (0x0000) enabled
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: Processor #0 Pentium 4(tm) 
XEON(tm) APIC version 16
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x0001] id[0x6] 
enabled[1])
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: CPU 1 (0x0600) enabled
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: Processor #6 Pentium 4(tm) 
XEON(tm) APIC version 16
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x0002] id[0x1] 
enabled[1])
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: CPU 2 (0x0100) enabled
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: Processor #1 Pentium 4(tm) 
XEON(tm) APIC version 16
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x0003] id[0x7] 
enabled[1])
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: CPU 3 (0x0700) enabled
Dec  3 18:32:28 spicymeatball kernel: Processor #7 Pentium 4(tm) 
XEON(tm) APIC version 16
But we're still only interrupting on CPU0 with this kernel.
