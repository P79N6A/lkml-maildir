Paulo, please ;)
Humm.... I've already found a way to make the debugger work (see th 
other thread) and at a first glance it seems unrelated to this. So I 
suspect I wouldn't gain much by testing it.
If you think it is worth doing it anyway, it won't be that much trouble 
to test yet another kernel, so I can certainly do it tonight...
