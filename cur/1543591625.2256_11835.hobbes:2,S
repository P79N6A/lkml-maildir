It most certainly is not. This attitude of pushing more and more stuff
out of the kernel and into initrd is really annoying. Initrd is messy,
nasty and opaque. It makes the boot process more complex. There is no
way in hell I want to be forced to use it.
Removing N lines from the kernel at the cost of adding N+k lines to
user-space is a *loss*, not a gain. I want my *system* to be simple
and transparent.

No, initrd is fundamentally painful. Let go of this ideology of
removing code from the kernel at all costs. A super-slim kernel which
requires a more complex to administer user-space is too high a cost.
The benefits of removing partition support from the kernel are
basically zero.
