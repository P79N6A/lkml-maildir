Subject: [PATCH,RFC] Transparent SuperPage Support for 2.5.44
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This is a transparent superpage support patch for 2.5.44.
Big difference between this patch and 2.4.19 patch is
eliminating of automatic dynamic downgrade for superpages.
Instead, I place pagesize adjust routine where required.
I hope this change minimize the overhead for conventional
programs which does not use superpages.
Linux SuperPage patch is transparent for user applications.
It will automatically allocate appropriate size of superpages
if possible.
It does not allocate real strage unless the application
really access that area. And it does not allocate memory
larger than the application requests.
This patch includes i386, alpha, sparc64 ports.
But I could not compile for alpha even with plain 2.5.44, and
I don't have sparc64 to test, then only i386 was tested now.
Any comments will be welcome.
I am not on this list, then please CC me for any comments.
