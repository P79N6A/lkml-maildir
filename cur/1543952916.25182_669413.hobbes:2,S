In current kernel the wakeup flag in /proc/acpi/wakeup means whether the
device can wakeup the sleeping system. It is only used to wake the
system from S1/S3/S4. 
Now the power/wakeup sys I/F is created for every device. Maybe it is
better that  the power/wakeup sys I/F is only created for the device
that can wake up the sleeping system. In order to determine whether the
device can wake up the sleeping system, it is necessary to check whether
the associated ACPI device can support wakeup  and whether the native
device can support wakeup (For example: PCI device should support PME
function.)

Now I am trying to do them. But the difficulty is that we should support
the runtime wakeup.
