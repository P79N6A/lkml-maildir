Its actually a nontrivial construct - especially since readers can vanish
and appear asynchronously during the lifetime of any event. You could 
implement it with multiple linked lists of pointers to refcounted objects,
and you could do that in user space (eg with shared memory), the chances
are that for all but the most extreme cases sending a copy of the event to
each listener is cheaper, simpler and more debuggable
