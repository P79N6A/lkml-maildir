Fair point...  Though the -rt variant has its shortcomings as well,
such as being unusable from NMI/SMI handlers.
How about this:  I continue running the GP_STAGES=3 run on the pair of
POWER machines (which are both going strong, and I also get a document
together describing the new version (and of course apply the changes we
have discussed, and merge with recent CPU-hotplug changes -- Gautham
Shenoy is currently working this), work out a good answer to "how
big exactly does GP_STAGES need to be", test whatever that number is,
assuming it is neither 3 nor 4, and figure out why the gekko-lp1 machine
choked on GP_STAGES=3.
Then we can work out the best path forward from wherever that ends up
being.
