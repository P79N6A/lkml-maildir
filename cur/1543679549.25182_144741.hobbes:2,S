Why restricting this to SSH ? I mean, this can occur even if you
are not using SSH.
Some per-user limit seems to be good... but if we do that, what about
also limiting the number of TCP/UDP ports used on a per-user basis ?
In fact, all the resources that are available should be per-user limited
if you want to avoid a single one causing a complete DoS...
