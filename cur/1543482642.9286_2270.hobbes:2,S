PTRACE_SYSCALL.  annul the syscall.  do what you want to the target
process.

In my view of the world, every process would be a direct child of
the user-mode kernel (UMK).  The UMK would handle the pseudo-parent-
and-child relationships by proxy'ing syscalls such as wait and
ptrace.
I have no clue how to handle things like device drivers, but I have
some of the puzzle pieces for the syscall filtering layer for a UMK.
