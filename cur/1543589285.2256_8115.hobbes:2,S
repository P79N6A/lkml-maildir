All three CDROM's are on the 1542. Sorry, you can't see that from [7.6].

How do I get "full panic info"? Pointers would help.
I copied the info from the screen to paper because the system was locked,
.../log/messages did not show anything. Allthough I am a programmer
(embedded systems) I do not yet know how to get more information, but I'm
working on it (I have RTFM in Documentation/, e.g. oops-tracing and in the
HOWTO's). This bites me so I want to know it.
The panic caused some lost files, so when testing new kernels for this
problem I stop after the first tried mount and reboot if it doesn't mount
and don't risk any more panics. As I mentioned in the mail, the panics are
follow up errors (kernel memory corrupted?). Too bad I can't use this box
as a crash system, I do only have this one and full restores with an old
Exabyte just take too long.
I diff'ed sr.c but can't find a bug there, but that hasn't say too much.
