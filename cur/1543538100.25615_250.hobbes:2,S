BTW: In response to Richard's complaints, as well as to problems with 
the API when we went to SMP, and to the discovery of POSIX 1001.13
we have switched over to a Pthreads based API -- and gdb even works.
It's not that different. I'm still trying to figure out a good solution

up with or hear about, but maybe someone will figure it out.
