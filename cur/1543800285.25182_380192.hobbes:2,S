I can clearly reply on this one :
root@pcw:vm# swapoff -a
root@pcw:vm# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:       1031752      84992     946760          0       3144      38564
-/+ buffers/cache:      43284     988468
Swap:            0          0          0
root@pcw:vm# echo 2 > overcommit_memory
root@pcw:vm# echo 0 > overcommit_ratio
root@pcw:vm# uname -a
bash: fork: Cannot allocate memory
root@pcw:vm# echo 10 > overcommit_ratio
root@pcw:vm# uname -a
Linux pcw 2.4.33-pre1 #1 SMP Fri Dec 30 21:52:06 CET 2005 i686 unknown

So as one could expect, if you're limited to allocation of
(swap_size)+0% of RAM, then you have a limit of 0 kB, so that
malloc() always fails. I'll do some crash tests with mmap, shm
and 100 ratio to see how it behaves, but at the moment it's
clearly good. Multi-process malloc cannot allocate more than
specified and that's good.
