... and I'm quite sure that EMACS could do it easily.  Let's not talk

I will take it into userland, thank you very much.

Except that in this case it doesn't make anything simpler.

They are related to the fact that we enter userland too late.  Which can
(and should) be fixed.
Linker is not something special - it's yet another userland program.
And we _can_ get userland early - before any drivers are initialized.
Including ramdisk.  Including any block filesystems.  Including at
least large part of (if not entire) PCI initialization.
All we need is s/rootfs/ramfs/ (8Kb patch, mostly removing code) and
unpacking archive to absolute root.  End of story.  Loader should
leave that archive (or concatenation of several archives) in core and
I don't believe that creating cpio on the fly is more complex than
whatever structure you will use to tell the kernel where these modules
are left in core.
All you need on the kernel side is a pass through the area where loader
had left the damn thing and uncpio to /.  After that we free that area
and do execve("/init", ...).  End of story.
BTW, we don't need a special device to handle initrd after that.  Just
have your initrd image (gzipped, whatever) in the archive under /initrd.
After that /init will have the contents in that file (regular file, at
that) and can do whatever it bloody wants.
It kills a _lot_ of kernel code.  And works nicely with any existing
loader - if they want they can build archive on the fly, but they can
just get a pre-built archive using the same mechanism they currently
use for initrd images.  IOW, we are backwards compatible with old
loaders.
