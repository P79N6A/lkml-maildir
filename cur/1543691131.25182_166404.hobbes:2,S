After these changes the code still works but I couldn't really measure
any differences to the code without the extra attributes.  This is on a
4p machine with 10 processes running in concurrently using mutexes and
condvars with 250 threads each.  This might be because either the hash
function is good or very bad (i.e., hashes all futexes in the same
bucket or far away).  I guess the extra attributes don't hurt.
