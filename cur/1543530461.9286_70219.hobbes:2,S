Either you compiled the SCSI driver as a module (double check your
.config) or it was compiled as builtin but failed to detect the
hardware (ask the ncr53c8xx maintainer).

Trying to load the SCSI driver.  Fix the "scsi : 0 hosts" and this
problem will go away.

08:xx is SCSI, side effect of no host found.
>NMI Watchdog detected LOCKUP on	CPU0, registers:
NMI oops is a side effect of having no root.  This is not a modprobe
problem, modprobe is only being called because the kernel needs root on
SCSI but there are no SCSI hosts found.  Fix the hosts problem and the
rest should disappear.
