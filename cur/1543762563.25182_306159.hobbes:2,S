Last I checked, Documentation/oops-tracking.txt wasn't under
Documentation/sound/alsa.  It seems obvious to me, but maybe it isn't
obvious to others, as your message appears to suggest.
As far as the question of ALSA documentation being up to date, that's
one set of directories in the kernel tree I've _never_ looked at, so
can't comment.  Sorry.
