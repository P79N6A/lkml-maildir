Thank you I will look forward to your comments.

In a thread voicing the concerns for maintaining out of tree patches

I am willing to contend that my approach also leads to a complete solution.
In fact I believe my network virtualization has actually gone much farther
than yours.   Although I admit there is still some work to do before
the code is in shape to be merged.
You notice in the kernel there is also not a struct process?
To me having a container structure while an obvious approach to the problem
seems to add unnecessary policy to the kernel.  Lumping together the
implementation of multiple instances of different namespaces in a way
that the implementation does not require.
