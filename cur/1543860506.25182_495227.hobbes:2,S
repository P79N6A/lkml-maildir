ok, how about this as a patch:
diff --git a/Documentation/CodingStyle b/Documentation/CodingStyle
index 9069189..064a13e 100644

 Generally, inline functions are preferable to macros resembling functions.
-Macros with multiple statements should be enclosed in a do - while block:
-
-#define macrofun(a, b, c) 			\
-	do {					\
-		if (a == 5)			\
-			do_this(b, c);		\
-	} while (0)
+There are two techniques for defining macros that contain multiple
+statements, depending on whether you're returning a value or not:
+
+ (a) If there is no return value from the macro, you should enclose
+     the statements in a do - while block, as in:
+
+	#define macrofun(a, b, c) 		\
+		do {				\
+			if (a == 5)		\
+				do_this(b, c);	\
+		} while (0)
+
+ (b) If the macro is designed to return a value, you should use the
+     gcc extension that a compound statement enclosed in parentheses
+     represents an expression, as in:
+
+	#define maxint(a, b) ({			\
+		int _a = (a), _b = (b);		\
+		_a > _b ? _a : _b;		\
+	})
