There are many way of being unreliable. If it means "bad things
happen and nobody is told about it", then yes, this would be
strange in this context. Howver, "loss due to congestion" is a
perfectly reasonable behaviour (*), and netlink indicates when
this has occurred.
If you get more events than you can queue or compress (e.g. if
you have on/off events but are only interested in the current
status, you could aggregate any number of such events in just
one bit), congestion is possible.
