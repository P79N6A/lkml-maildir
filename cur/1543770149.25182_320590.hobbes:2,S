Please just read the code like I asked.  If you do, you'll find that the
sdev_classdev release method is NULL until scsi_sysfs_add_sdev()
precisely for the reason that the class references don't matter until
that point.  We're free to kill the whole thing without bothering about
the class devices until scsi_add_lun detects something and calls
scsi_sysfs_add_sdev() to make the whole thing visible.  Then all
classdevs get a ref on the parent gendev which their release method
relinquishes.

Well, I know aic7xxx works perfectly on a dual channel card, because I
actually test the failure paths and insmod/rmmod is one of my tests.  I
can't comment on aic79xx because I don't have the hardware.
