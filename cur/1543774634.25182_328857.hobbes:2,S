Ignoring Hans' point, there is still a performance gain.
Assume we can do on-disk caching, similar to fscache/cachefs for nfs.
Now, benchmark:
$ unzip linux-2.6.12.zip && make -C linux-2.6.12
versus the hypothetical
$ make -C linux-2.6.12.zip/.../contents
This is an automatic performance gain, in theory, because the second
command is identical to unzipping just the parts you need into
linux-2.6.12, then running "make".  The one disadvantage is that because
the unzipping is done on demand, it only really performs well if you can
keep the "zip" binary cached.  Even on most embedded systems, 54K of RAM
is really not much to ask these days.
Also, once you've run "make" once, you get to run it as many times as
you like, and so long as the on-disk cache of the zipfile is still there
and valid, you never have the overhead of unzipping again.
Of course, this probably saves only a minute or two at most per kernel
compile.  But that doesn't mean there aren't real-world situations where
this kind of architecture would be much more beneficial.

 and ponder until enlightenment arrives.
So what?  I don't intend to convince anyone based on how much
slower/faster their kernel compiles.  It's meant to illustrate the
principle of the thing.
Besides, your point was that you could not run make inside of a kernel
tarball/zipfile.  Nobody ever suggested that you would actually want to.
