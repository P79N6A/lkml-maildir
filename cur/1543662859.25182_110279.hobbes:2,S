It may also affect UML, since it has come to know exactly what to expect
from a ptraced process.  So, when you have the semantics nailed down and
implemented, can you see if UML still runs?
Not that it's a showstopper if it doesn't, but I'd like to know so I can
fiddle UML so that it continues to run.
