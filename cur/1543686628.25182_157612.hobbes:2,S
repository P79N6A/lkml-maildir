It is not a Prism 2.5 chipset, it is an Intel chipset that currently is
unsupported. I have not had a response from Intel in my last mail to
them, but I guess there could be holiday time there.
For the time being those mini-PCI cards is dead weight in the laptop I
am afraid. I hope that either Intel suddenly sees sense (snowflake in
hell analogy coming on) or some bright spark reverse engineers the card
and writes an alpha driver that surpasses the functionality of the Intel
beta drivers they keep under lock and key internally.
I'll probably locate some Prism CardBus card in the meantime to use.
