What's the gcc bug?  The current fixup.c code is asking gcc to put
toshiba_ohci1394_dmi_table[] in the .init.text section.  This makes
gcc think that .init.text contains writable data.  Then some other
declaration in the file asks gcc to put a function in .init.text.  gcc
correctly complains that text and writable data can't share a section.
If we fix toshiba_ohci1394_dmi_table[] to go into .init.data as is
intended, then gcc is happy.
The only thing remotely like a gcc bug is that the diagnostic gcc
prints does not flag toshiba_ohci1394_dmi_table[] as the problem.
Admittedly I have only tested gcc 4.0 and gcc 3.4, but given that no
one reported this problem before toshiba_ohci1394_dmi_table[] was
added, and that the __devinit declaration of an array is obviously
wrong and would cause exactly this sort of section conflict, I think
we should at least try the correct fix.
