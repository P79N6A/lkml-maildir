I tried to find documentation about the sysctl library function on kernel  
2.4.
The sysctl man pages are not so detailed.I need examples to understand the
function and its behaviour.
I found on the web only two articles :
1)www.geocities.com/chrootstrap/writing_sysctl_drivers_on_linux.html
2)www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=2365
The first is good but a bit short and the 2th is good but too old.
I tried to find more infos (how-to , guides, manuals, articles) but I found
no more docs.
Does someone know where to find other sysctl detailed infos ?
Thanks
