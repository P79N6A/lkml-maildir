It gets called later in that case.

I think you'll need to move the clock gating thing to be a sysdev 
suspend/resume event, which gets done really early along with things like 
core timekeeping etc. We kind of hit that already with the USB driver, 
where CONFIG_PPC does all kinds of wrong things:
	#ifdef CONFIG_PPC_PMAC
	        if (retval == 0) {
	                /* Disable ASIC clocks for USB */
	                if (machine_is(powermac)) {
	                        struct device_node      *of_node;
	                        of_node = pci_device_to_OF_node(dev);
	                        if (of_node)
	                                pmac_call_feature(PMAC_FTR_USB_ENABLE,
	                                                        of_node, 0, 0);
	                }
	        }
	#endif
inside the hcd-pci.c driver. If that whole thing was a sysdev feature, you 
wouldn't need that kind of insane "do my own arch-specific thing in a 
generic driver" thing. AND waking it up would work too.
I'm assuming this is exactly the kind of thing that is now biting you?
