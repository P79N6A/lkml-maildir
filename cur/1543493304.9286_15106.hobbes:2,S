I know you guys are tired of hearing this from me, but ... it will take a
while for me to be able to do the suggested tests (as it's a production
system, and the customer does not have 'Net access, and blah blah blah
...). I'm listing all of them, though. The ones I have pending so far are:
- 'lspci -H1 -vvx' with the latest pciutils (Martin Mares);
- apply provided patch and check whether it makes a difference (Gerard
  Roudier);
Does someone has any other suggestions ?!?!
Martin, could you please give me a URL or something similar as to where to
find the latest alpha release of pciutils ?? Does it run under 2.0.36
(upgrading this system to a 2.2.x kernel is not an option, at least in the
short run) ?!?
As soon as I get around these test results, I'll post them in the list.
Thank you very much for all the help provided.
Regards,
Ivan
