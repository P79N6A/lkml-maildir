Is anyone besides me having difficulty cloning a tree from
linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5 or 2.6?
I keep getting:
[mdharm@g5 mdharm]$ bk clone bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5 linux-405-2.5
Clone bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.5
   -> file://home/mdharm/linux-405-2.5
BAD gzip hdr
read: No such file or directory
0 bytes uncompressed to 0, nanX expansion
sfio errored
I can clone from linuxusb, so I don't _think_ it's a problem on my end...
