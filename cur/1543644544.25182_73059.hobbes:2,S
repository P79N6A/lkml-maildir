The behaviour does seem wrong. Resolution should not be faked to be
more accurate than the granularity offered by the underlying file
system. Timestamps can be persistently stored, or stored for longer
periods of times, for all sorts of reasons beyond 'make', each with
consequence that cannot be determined here.
What would it take to get microsecond or better time stored in ext[23]?
