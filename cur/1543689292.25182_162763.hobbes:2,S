Explain the cache footprint argument - if you're only using a single
copy from any given cpu, it shouldn't affect the cpu cache. More 
importantly, it'll massively reduce the footprint on the NUMA 
interconnect cache, which is the whole point of doing text replication.

Not if you have an SSI cluster, that's the point.

No, each node in an SSI cluster has its own pagecache, that's mostly
independant.

Indeed, unless the hypervisor-type-layer sets up an efficient cross
communication mechanism, that doesn't involve it for every transaction.
Yes, there's some cost here. If the workload is fairly "independant"
(between processes), it's easy, if it does a lot of cross-process
traffic with pipes and shit, it's going to hurt to some extent, but 
it *may* be fairly small, depending on the implementation.

True. depends on how the processes / threads in that app communicate
as to how big the impact would be. There's nothing saying that two
processes of the same app in an SSI cluster can't run on different
nodes ... we present a single system image to userspace, across nodes.
Some of the glue layer (eg for ps, to give a simple example), like
for_each_task, is where the hard work in doing this is.

You *need* to be able to migrate processes across nodes. Yes, it's hard.
Doing it at exec time is easier, but still far from trivial, and not
sufficient anyway.

It raises a lot of hard issues. It addresses a lot of hard issues. 
IMHO, it's a fascinating concept, that deserves some attention, and
I'd love to work on it. However, I'm far from sure it'd work out, and
until it's proven to do so, it's unreasonable to expect people to give
up working on the existing methods in favour of an unproven (but rather
cool) pipe-dream. 
What we're doing now is mostly just small incremental changes, and unlike Larry, I don't believe it's harmful (I'm not delving back into that 
debate again - see the mail archives of this list). I'd love to see how
the radical SSI cluster approach compares, when it's done. If I can 
get funding for it, I'll help it get done.
