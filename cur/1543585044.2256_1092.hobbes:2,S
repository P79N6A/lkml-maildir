Well, it's been almost a week since the latest stupid bug was found in the 
JFFS2 code, so I suppose it's time to admit to the world that it exists.
JFFS2, developed by Red Hat, is a complete reimplementation of a 
journalling filesystem for FLASH devices, based on the original JFFS 
from Axis Communications AB. 
Improvements of JFFS2 over the original JFFS include:
	- Improved wear levelling and garbage collection performance.
	- Compression
	- Improved RAM footprint and response to system memory pressure.
	- Improved concurrency and support for suspending flash erases
	- Support for hard links.
You can get it from anonymous CVS:
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.infradead.org:/home/cvs login (password: anoncvs)
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.infradead.org:/home/cvs co mtd
The only platform currently supported is Linux 2.4. A port to eCos is 
likely to happen quite soon.
JFFS2 filesystem images of the current 'Familiar' distribution for the
Compaq iPAQ, along with appropriate kernels, are available at 
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/people/dwmw2/familiar-0.3/
