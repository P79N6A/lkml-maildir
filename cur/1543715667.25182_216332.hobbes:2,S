True, I haven't seen any failures with that kernel (which comes with Rocks 2.3.2, which is based on RH 7.3).  On the other hand, I haven't rebooted it nearly as often as the others, so I can't be confident the error doesn't occur there.

I did try 2.4.26 and it has the same problem.  
I'm afraid I've already spent as much time (and as much hardware) as I can afford on this problem.  I wrote a script to reboot if processors are missing.  That should suffice for my needs for now.
If anyone else encounters this problem, or someone who knows the smp boot code or the Intel motherboards is interested in helping, please let me know and I'll see what else I can do.
