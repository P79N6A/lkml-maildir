I don't know.
In fact, I have found that apparently there is a worse ACPI regression 
between 2.4.20-pre5 and 2.4.20-rc1; I have one machine here which does 
not work without ACPI (because of broken PCI tables -- that's what you 
get for duplicating data), and -pre5 works on it and -rc1 doesn't.
I will try 2.5.<latest> when I get home this evening.
