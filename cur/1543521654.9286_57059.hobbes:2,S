LS,
Just looked over the uid16.c file, functions sys_getgroup16()
and sys_setgroup16().
Every function correctly uses the high2lowgid and low2highgid
stuff correctly, except those 2. I presume the array we read
/write from user space contains 16 bits gids, so they must
be converted to 32 bit gids, yes?
I'm also puzzled by the sys_setuid16() and sys_setgid16() functions,
but I assume the high/low functions are not needed here, since
the -1 value has no special meaning here?
Hmmm, come to think of it, the group function have probably the
same reasoning?
    Met vriendelijke groet,
        Pauline Middelink
