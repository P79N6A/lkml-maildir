I need the same for APM. (I would prefer ACPI, but it currently hangs by box) 
I have to use vesafb or I get artifacts (Trident CyberBlade/XP), but then a
resume from APM never restores the video.  Presumably, a reset (similar to
when the fb is turned on?) would fix the problem.  I haven't looked into it
yet due to lack of time, but if someone else is going to work on it, I'll
gladly help test.
