Subject: [PATCH] QStor SATA/RAID driver for 2.6.9-rc3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Here is the current release of the 2.6.xx driver source code
for the Pacific Digital Corporation QStor SATA/RAID chip.
This 4-channel chip has hardware-assisted RAID0/RAID1/RAID10,
host-queuing, per-request TCQ/NCQ support, support for hot insertion
and removal of drives, etc..  The 64-bit/66Mhz chip shows throughput
in excess of 220MByte/sec on my ancient P3-1GHz test system,
and can do much better when installed in a PCI-X slot.
The driver (attached) supports most of the chip features,
including host, native and legacy tagged queuing,
but does not yet include boot-from-raid support (coming soon),
or SATA port-multipliers.
Both hdparm and smartmontools are supported by this driver.
This patch is against linux-2.6.9-rc3.
