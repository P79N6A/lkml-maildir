Hi Andrew,
These macros set the SD_POWERSAVINGS_BALANCE flag based on the
sysfs tunable.

Your are suggesting to move these to inline functions.   I will write
a patch and post for review.

Agreed, but these macros are used throughout sched.c and are
performance sensitive.  Inline functions are a close enough
replacement for the macro let me look for any performance penalty as
well and report.
Thanks for the review and comments.
