Umm, what CPU is X going to run on in that case?
You have two high-priority, interactive tasks to be scheduled: X and
xosview.  You have one low-priority background task --- the
benchmark.  If both xosview and X are ever runnable at the same time,
then the benchmark task MUST be bumped off the cpu.  And if the other
cpu becomes free first, then what are you going to do?  Leave it idle?
That may win in some cases but in general it's a bad idea to bet that
way.
