I agree with you but we are going to load Ubiquity software on this server
and they approve only the Red Hat Linux 7.3 load. I will write them and see
if we might use a newer load.
Thank You

Thats the first thing to change. Red Hat 7.3 is very very old. Linux,
installers and the rest have come on a long way since then. Its a bit
like "I'm having trouble installing Windows 95 on my new machine".
Red Hat Linux itself has turned into Fedora Core (end user), and Red Hat
Enterprise Linux (packaged with support).
