i'd be happy to, but based on my previous experience sending
in a few patches, it's just not worth the aggravation any more.
just one of my patches that got adopted took, literally, several
weeks of being dropped on the floor with no reason why.  and i
had to resubmit it, slightly updated, for every BK rev of the
kernel since the previous patch wouldn't apply cleanly --
it might be a line or two off, which would require remaking
the patch and resubmitting it *again*.  at which point, it
would be dropped on the floor *again*.
don't get me wrong -- i understand that there has to be some
form of QA in accepting kernel patches, and after a while, 
regular submitters can build up a reputation.
but, at this point, it's not terribly useful to encourage people
to submit patches if those patches are just tossed.
it's like the classic catch-22:
  "we can't hire you.  you don't have enough experience doing
    this job."
  "ok, so how do i get experience?"
  "well, you have to do this job for a while."
uh, right.  so, while there's not much point in my submitting
patches, i can still toss suggestions from the sidelines, unless
you have some ideas.  i'm certainly open to advice.
