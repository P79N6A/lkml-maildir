I can list two machines with USB that are slower - and I run both of
them...
 1. P166 (non-MMX) based, with USB on the motherboard. Currently
    unused, but I plan on plugging a digital camera SmartMedia card
    reader into it when I get one.
 2. 486dx4/120 with USB on a plug in ISA-bus card (I'm not joking
    either).
I'll admit that I was surprised to come across that ISA-bus USB card
at a local radio rally, but as they only wanted £2.50 for it, I paid
the pennies and tried it out. It works fine for my scanner interface
although I've never tried it for anything else.
Best wishes from Riley.
