Much as I would love to help, I'm usually buried under schoolwork.   
In any
case, I really have to admire the people behind the project, translating
tens of thousands of MIPS assembly instructions to C, documenting the C,
then giving the documentation to somebody else to write the driver even
though by that point you could write it backwards in a blindfold,  
that has
_got_ to be hard and frustrating work.
Cheers,

software stuff and not get a real job. Charles Shultz had the best  
answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because
life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't. That's why I  
draw
cartoons. It's my life."
