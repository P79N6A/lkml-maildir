Hi Roman.
Despite the fact that you are advancing slowly could you explain what your plans
are with the configuration system?
As of today we have basically three different ways to read the Config.in files,
where xconfig are the one with the best but also most critical parser/analyser.
Do you plan to replace all of them or?
Have you planned to let CML1 and ZCONF(or whatever you planned to call the
new semantic) co-exist?
