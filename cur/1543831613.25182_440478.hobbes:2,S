The most common error?  A few years ago I restored a file from
backup, because I deleted it in error.  I can't even remember
the second-last time I had that problem.
I'd say this error is among the easiest to avoid. :-)
Even a little performance loss won't justify it for me.
Now, there may be clumsier users than me, but they tend to
be using GUI "file managers" which do implement a "wastebasket"
for all internal deletion.
