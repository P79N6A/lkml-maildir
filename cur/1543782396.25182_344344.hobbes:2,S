Well, it's been running here for a few hours this evening, and I must say
that I have not noticed anything strange yet (except the printk timestamps
which switch to zero twice during boot and start with funny values, but
that's not important). The box is a dual-k7 with aic7xxx, and NFSv3 over
an e1000 NIC. Tested with SMP and preempt enabled.
