I know not Sam's tree.
It's a generic thing. "gcc -g" does not cause compiled .S files to include
debugging information, and -O1 optimised code is more debuggable than -O2
optimised code.

-O1: Dunno; if they don't they're buggy, and if they don't they're buggy.
-Wa,--gdwarf2: No, no and no.
I can move the -Wa flag back into the frv arch if you insist, but moving the
-O1 flag there is more tricky, since it'd then be overridden in master
Makefile.
