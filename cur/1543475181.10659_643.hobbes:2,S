just thought i'd mention this minor bug... (v 2.2.0-pre4 on ia32)
during kernel configuration, the new processor family menu looks like:
386
486/Cx486
586/K5/5x86/6x86
Pentium/TSC
PPro/K6/6x86MX
     ^^
but the help text says that a K6 is a Pentium, not a Pentium Pro.
AFAIK, the AMD K6 is a Socket 7 Pentium replacement, not a Pentium Pro
or Pentium-II, so the help text is correct, and the menu should
be fixed.
