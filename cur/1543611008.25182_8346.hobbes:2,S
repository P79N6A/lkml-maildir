OK. Of course. It's just a few lines length:
Just mention to create any "test.dat" file in the current directory;

Additionally  the interesting thing is - if I change MMAP params to:
p=mmap(NULL,4096, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE , MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANON ,-1 ,0);
(The only change is mapping done ammoniums instead of mmaping  a file
- this increases speed really much and it does not decrease)
