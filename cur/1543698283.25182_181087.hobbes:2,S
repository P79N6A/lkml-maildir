One thing that might be of interest - XFS does tend to pass
variable size requests down to the block layer, and this has
tripped up md and other drivers in 2.4 in the distant past.
Log IO is typically 512 byte aligned (as opposed to block or
page size aligned), as are IOs into several of XFS' metadata
structures.

I would tend to agree (but will happily fix things if proven
wrong ;) - I took a brief look through dm & md this afternoon
but nothing obvious jumped out at me.  I'm not particularly
familiar with that code though.
cheers.
