I think that's especially true. If a user begins with a single full disk 
for their entire filesystem, uses tar to backup, and then later adds a 
second disk, copies everything from /usr and /home onto partitions there 
(making sure to preserve all interesting bits like ctime/mtime), and 
mounts them over the original directories, tar should not decide that 
every file in /usr and /home was deleted and recreated.
