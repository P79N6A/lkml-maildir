This will return 'int foo(void)', what's the problem ?

It will only return 'foo(void)', and you won't find its return type.
Personally, I strongly prefer getting maximum information in one line, and
I find it useful to have the return type, the name and the args together.
If you still need the name and only the name, use some sed on the output :
   sed 's/^\([^ ]* \)*\([^]*\)(.*/\2/'
Cheers,
