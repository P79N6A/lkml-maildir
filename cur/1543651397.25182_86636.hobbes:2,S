Hello all,
can i ask you some silly questions:
arch/i386/config.in contains line below:
"If you want to see it working mail an VW540 to hch@infradead.org 8)"
arch/i386/mach-visws/visws-apic.c also contains interesting line:
"Copyright (C) 1999 Bent Hagemark, Ingo Molnar"
May be you have some VISWS docs hidden in your attic ?
Best regards.
