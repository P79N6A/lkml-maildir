Suppose you have two database transactions, the first
of which needs to be flushed before the second one
can be flushed.
Now suppose these transactions are on the *record* level
and two records from both transactions share one page in
memory.
Now how are you going to flush the one transaction while
keeping back the other one?

None, you're right here. The overhead we would have is
not of the pagetable/tlb kind, but of the "split VMA into
dozens of smaller ones" kind. Probably just as expensive,
but something different ;)

But at what cost?  System calls and kernel operations can be
quite expensive. Doing a system call and modifying 200 bytes
of in-kernel data (holding expensive locks) probably isn't
worth it when all it saves is copying around a 50 byte database
record.
