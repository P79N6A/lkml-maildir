It is interesting to compare the wording of the Solaris man page, it
sounds pretty much like the SuSv2 paragraph above, but without the
restriction that the result is unspecified, it guarantees the extending
is a legitimate operation. Sounds like the SuSv2 authors chickened out
on that issue, most of the Unix platforms I know (including SunOS 4&5,
HP/UX, IRIX, Tru64, AIX and various *BSD) do happily extend a file on
truncate.
