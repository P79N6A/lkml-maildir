You're right.  The kernel sort-of saw the second CPU but it appears to have
not come up.
Have you used any other 2.5 kernels?  Are you able to pinpoint and
particular kernel version at which this started to happen?
If not then I'd appreciate it if you could test stock 2.4.74.

That's a warning, not an oops.  The ACPI IRQ handler claims that it's not
handling the IRQ all the time.  That's a fairly, err, mature problem
actually.
