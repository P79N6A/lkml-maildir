the ACPI idle code runs with irqs disabled anyway, so there's no issue 
here. If something takes long there, we can do little about it. (but in 
practice ACPI sleep latencies are pretty ok - the only latencies i found 
in the past were due to need_resched bugs in the ACPI idle routine)

Yes, idle threads can have preemption disabled. There's not any big 
difference in terms of latencies, the execution paths are all very 
short.
