I posted a URL last Saturday to the patch, and Andrew merged it into 
-test4-mm4. 
If you're interested in testing, please try -test4-mm6, as it has a couple 
of more fixes.

What model is it? It probably doesn't support APM at all. I can't
guarantee that ACPI suspend/resume will work on it, but I'm interested to 
see if it does..
