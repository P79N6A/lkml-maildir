Let me ask you, are you noticing slowness sending or receiving?  I'm having
a similar problem (2.4.25 and 2.6.4 is slow).  I had upgraded the machine
and kernel at the same time.  The nic is a 3c905b+mba nic (it netboots). 
Receiving seems fairly quick, but sending seems slow.  My definition of slow
is "not to it's full speed".  I see about 5mb/sec when I transfer files from
that machine (the disk was capable of 26mb/sec on a file, over network it
was about 5mb/sec)  I noticed the nic was sharing an IRQ (12) with the sound
card (not in use at all).
I should downgrade to 2.4.22 to see if I see a difference.  Oddly, I had
this same board in another machine (which was upgraded) using a 3c990 nic
w/o problems (kernel 2.6.x).  However, I didn't often send files at full
speed either.
