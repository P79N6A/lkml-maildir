Heh, yeah. That's a very odd way to write it.
It would probably make more sense to just write it as something like
	struct zone *base = zone->zone_pgdat->node_zones;
	if (zone == base + ZONE_HIGHMEM ||
		(zone == base + ZONE_MOVABLE && zone_movable_is_highmem());
instead.
The above is totally untested, of course.
