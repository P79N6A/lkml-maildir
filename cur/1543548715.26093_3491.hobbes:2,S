Yes. In effect you have a 32-bit counter that serves as a guarantees
that an inode is not reused 'within a reasonable period of time'.

We'd want to make an implementation that is generic and fits all
'commonly used' UNIX filesystems. That means that we don't want to
apply an ext2-specific hack at the VFS or nfsd levels.  The
inode-generation field is a feature on several filesystems which
already support sub-second timestamps.
