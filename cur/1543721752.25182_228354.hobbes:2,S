Timothy,
Who are you to revoke my request to SuSE and other distributors and others who share
my views on LKML?
What is wrong with making a demand for standardization?. It's high time
that things got a bit more organized. And where do you see a demand....I just
said "like to see". Which is more of a request the way I understand English.
It's high time people like me spoke up for standardization and some sense of
organization. If the majority doesn't want to listen fine, it's a free world,
but you have no right to silence me for airing my views.
best regards
Dev Mazumdar
