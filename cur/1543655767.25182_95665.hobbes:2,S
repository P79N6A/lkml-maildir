Hello list,
I am trying to configure a notebook with a PCMCIA NIC to boot over network. 
(kernel 2.4.20)
In order to accomplish this I passed over the neccessary configuration 
paramters through the boot loader (ip, root, nfsroot)
The problem is: When the kernel is booting it is trying to configure the 
Network interface, before it has been activated.
Thus my question is: Is it possible somehow to change the order by some 
configuration parameter ?!?
Thanks for answers in advance
- -Andreas
