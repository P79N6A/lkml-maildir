There's some more information. Hope that it helps, since md5summing whole
CDs takes lots of time... ask freely if something is missing.

I made more tests with differently compiled kernels:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640=y, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RZ1000=y:
	8 out of 9 cd-r disks worked
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640=y, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RZ1000 is not set
	1 out of 5 cd-r disks worked
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640 is not set, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RZ1000=y
	1 out of 5 cd-r disks worked
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640 is not set, CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RZ1000 is not set
	3 out of 8 cd-r disks worked
By saying that it "worked" I mean that I get correct MD5sum with
	dd if=/dev/cdrom bs=2048 count=<size> | md5sum
It seems that if I select either RZ1000 or CMD640 chipset bugfixes,
the situation changes worse, but if select both, the problem
is almost fixed. Or maybe it just depends on the moon phase.
The CD-R drive manual doesn't say what engine it has nor the device
has anything printed on it. cdrecord says that it has "Philips CDD-522"
core, I don't know then how much one can trust that. (And let me remind
you that the device is Mitsumi CR2801TE cd-r drive).
My CPU is standard Pentium 120 MHz:

The motherboard doesn't have any manuals, but I see two chips labelled

SL23P		SL238
