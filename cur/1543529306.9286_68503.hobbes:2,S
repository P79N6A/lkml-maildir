  I have to agree with Richard here. From what I've been told, it's
  fairly "expensive" for an Alpha to "jump" for an IRQ interrupt and
  not get it - i.e. wasted time. If the code exists to support it, the
  "default setup" at init time could be to assign IRQs rotating
  through the list of CPUs. This way no IRQ would be sent to more than
  one CPU (if I'm understanding correctly how all this works)
  therefore incurring no wasted cycles.
