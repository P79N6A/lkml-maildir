"Of course", because in many parts of the world, a device who's manufacturer 
fails to take reasonable steps to prevent it from being used outside 
regulatory limits is illegal.  Providing source code not only is a failure 
to take those reasonable steps, but is quite the opposite.  It may even be 
viewed as encouraging users to use it inappropriately.
