Hmmm... I still can't reproduce it.
What happens if you change your /etc/exports file to:
/               *(rw,async,fsid=0)
/usr/src        *(rw,async,nohide)
/mnt/export     *(rw,async,nohide)
Also, does removing the "/mnt/export" line from /etc/exports mean that the
/mnt reappears in the directory listing?
