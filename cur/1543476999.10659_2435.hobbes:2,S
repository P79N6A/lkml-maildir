One thing I see now that I examine the mail headers more closely, is
that I am receiving linux-kernel via listserv.funet.fi:

This means that mails are being bounced across the Atlantic *twice*
(vger->Finland->Detroit).  Are there any repeaters in North America?
I did notice that since the weekend, the list has been flowing much
better, presumably because of restricting CVS access on vger.  Time to
seperate the list and CVS on different machines?
