Isn't this all covered by the LGPL ? (Library GPL)
If the kernel is counted as a library (by the module, or the module
counted as a library by the kernel) doesn't that fit with the LGPL
definition? I believe the LGPL covers the runtime library.
This was hashed out some time ago - If I remember correctly Linus didn't
favor the LGPL for kernel because that ment the interface between
the kernel and modules had to become more "static", restricting the
future enhancements of the kernel/module interface.
