Hmm. In such a suit, however, the user would not be "the licensee" and
would not be a party to the suit - some author would be the plaintiff
and would be suing someone for doing something in violation of the
license that author granted - that is, the *defendant* would be the
licensee who would get the benefit of the doubt...
