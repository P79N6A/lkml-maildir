  dear sir 
i want to design a system moniter for linux 
could you just guide me on what will be the basic
architerture like:
i have thought of
kernel(using printk)->logfile(myfile)->application
but in order to make it real time .please correct me
on this architecture 
and i am unable to find some functions where the user
as well as kernel threads are actually exited also i
want to distinguish between the user level and kernel
level at that moment.but as i have done during the
forking of thread in fork.c in do_fork function
through the use of
if(p->mm==null)i could check the kernel thread or user
thread but i am unable do so during exit in exit.c in
do_exit function it seems that in somewhere between
execution the tsk->mm is being filled up .
so do i need to find some other place from which i can
find out about exiting threads and processes and what
will i check to see the user thread is exited or
kernel thread.
thanks sounak
