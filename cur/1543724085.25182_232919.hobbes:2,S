I'm curious--this seems to be exactly what the cluster membership portion of the 
SAF spec provides.  Would it make sense to contribute to that portion of 
OpenAIS, then export the CMAN API on top of it for backwards compatibility?
It just seems like there are a bunch of different cluster messaging, membership, 
etc. systems, and there is a lot of work being done in parallel with different 
implementations of the same functionality.  Now that there is a standard 
emerging for clustering (good or bad, we've got people asking for it) would it 
make sense to try and get behind that standard and try and make a reference 
implementation?
You guys are more experienced than I, but it seems a bit of a waste to see all 
these projects re-inventing the wheel.
