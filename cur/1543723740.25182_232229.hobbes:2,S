Hello,
In Linux 2.6 kernel, configured with SCHED_RR, - could rescheduling be set
to be attempted (and executed when appropriate) at EVERY CLOCK TICK, thus
allowing the "other" process/thread (if available and ready at the moment)
with the higher (highest at that time) priority or, otherwise, with the same
priority (the "next" process/thread in the same Round Robin queue, from
which the "current" process/thread was "picked" ) to preempt the "current"
process/thread ?
If EVERY CLOCK TICK is not conceptually possible (please note, that I am not
claiming that frequent rescheduling is "good", I am just asking to what
measure it is possible ...) - then what is the minimum "rescheduling" time
quantum (measured in clock ticks) is settable/possible ?
What is the default value (which I presume was chosen as "optimal" ?) ?
Thanks,
Best Regards,
Alex Povolotsky

in Linux there's no difference between the scheduling of 'threads' and
'processes'. Both are internally a 'task'. If two tasks share the same
MM (this is possible via the use of clone()) then they are called
threads. If a task has its own MM (normally created via fork()) then
it's called a process - but the scheduler doesn't care.
so the normal Linux scheduling policy applies to 'threads' too. Fully
preemptable, SCHED_NORMAL by default, or SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR if you set
it. The priority (or rt_priority) can be set per-task as well. Newly
created threads/processes may inherit (or not) the policy of the parent,
this largely depends on the library implementation.
