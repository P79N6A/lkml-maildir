I would expect this to take more like 5 years. Sure, someone could whip
out a clone that can migrate processes and look like it's doing load
balancing, but the performance issues in parrallel computing are so much
harder to debug, and even quantify. Writing a MOSIX clone is going to take
a great deal of knowledge, not to mention a cluster to test on.
I propose that those of you who want a MOSIX clone, go get the GPL'ed
kernel modifications they made, and us it as a base for a generic
load balancing and process migration API for the linux kernel.
I would hope that this idea could then resolve this license fiasco, and
allow those of us that are interested in using/evalutating MOSIX to do so,
and provide a framework for future GPL'ed work.
