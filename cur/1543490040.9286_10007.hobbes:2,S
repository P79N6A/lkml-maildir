The inode also has to be the same and one of the nfs clients
has to have the file `open'.  So it does seem remote.

The reason that you want to get a random number is to make it
harder for someone to guess it.  If you can't guess the inode/
generation number you can't access the file.
I must say you are right about the expense of get_random_bytes().
However if you don't seed the i_generation number each time then
you get very little security from the i_generation numbers and
they should only be used for correctness.
The reason is that you can set up a daemon that creates a file and
then deletes it in a loop looking at the inode after each create.
If the inode is different then it knows that someone created a file
and you also know the filehandle for that file.  This is not a problem
at the moment because we check the permissions on the path to a file.
However many people would like to see linux nfs behave more like
other nfs implementations.
I would appreciate more input on this.
