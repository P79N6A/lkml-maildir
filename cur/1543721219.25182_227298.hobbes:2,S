I'm running an x86 version of 2.6.5, attempting to use a lexar CF memory
card with the Jumpshot card reader.
possibly relevent config options:
CONFIG_SCSI=y
CONFIG_SCSI_PROC_FS=y
CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG=y
CONFIG_USB=y
CONFIG_USB_UHCI_HCD=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_JUMPSHOT=y
When I plug the card in I get the following:
Jun 14 23:27:42 doug kernel: usb 2-2.1: new full speed USB device using
address 4
Jun 14 23:27:42 doug kernel: usb-storage: probe of 2-2.1:1.0 failed with
error -5
It works fine under windows.
