In the early 1990's (and maybe even the mid 90's), the typical hard
disk's storage could theoretically be byte-addressed using 32-bit
addresses -- just as (if I understand you correctly) you are arguing
that today's hard disks can be byte-addressed using 64-bit addresses.
If this was going to be practical ever (on commodity hardware anyway),
I would have expected someone to try it on a 32-bit PC or Mac when
hard drives were in the 100MB-3GB range... That suggests to me that
there's a more fundamental reason (i.e. other than lack of address
space) that caused people to stick with the current scheme.

tmpfs isn't "definitely faster". Remember those benchmarks where Linux
ext2 beat Solaris tmpfs?

Also, the only way I see where "there is no more swapping" and
"[y]ou're dealing with memory only" is if the disk *becomes* main
memory, and main memory becomes an L3 (or L4) cache for the CPU [and
as a consequence, main memory also becomes the main form of long-term
storage]. Is that what you're proposing?
If so, then it actually makes *less* sense to me than before -- with
your scheme, you've reduced the speed of main memory by 100x or more,
then you try to compensate with a huge cache. IOW, you've reduced the
speed of *main* memory to (more or less) the speed of today's swap!
Suddenly it doesn't sound so good anymore...
