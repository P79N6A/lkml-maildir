ACK.  Have tested two kernels in the past 24 hours, and the third is
building as I type this.  The builds seem to be taking about 3 hours
each.  First two tests good, so the offending commit is somewhere in
the last 25% (roughly) of the changes between -rc2 and -rc3: git says
82 revisions left to test.  Might have this painted into a corner in
the next day or so.  I'll try to be quick about it, since -rc4 is out.

Will do...  I'm in the fortunate position of having enough disk space
on my Alpha that I can maintain multiple trees for this kind of effort.
