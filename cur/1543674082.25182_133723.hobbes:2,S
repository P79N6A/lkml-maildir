that's the issue yes. but then when a multithreaded app sends a signal
to another process  it can take up to this "x" timeslice portion before
the signal will run (I mean in UP). Same goes for mouse clicks etc..
1msec for mouse clicks should not be noticeable though. And over all I
don't see a real big issue in the current code.
To try it probably the simpler way to add a need_resched_timeout
along to need_resched, and to honour the need_resched only when the
timeout triggers, immediate need_resched will set the timeout = jiffies
so it'll trigger immediatly, the timer interrupt will check it. The
reschedule_idle on a non idle cpu will be the only one to set the
timeout. Effectively I'm curious to see what will happen. Not all archs
would need to check against it (the entry.S code is the main reader of
need_resched), it'll be an hint only and idle() for sure must not check
it at all. this would guarantee minimal timeslice reserved up to 1/HZ by
setting the timeout to jiffies + 2 (jiffies + 1 would return a mean of
1/HZ/2 but the worst case would be ~0, in practice even + 1 would be
enough) Does anybody think this could have a value? If yes I can make a
quick hack to see what happens.
