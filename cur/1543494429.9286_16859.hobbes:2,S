I did my monthly save under 2.2.7 and hit the phase error again, which I
have been getting since late 2.1.xxx. Random disk data is corrupted and
this time it took me a few hours to get the system back up.
The scsi guys say that it is caused by something else polluting the bus.
System was copying from scsi disk to ide tape at the time.
2.0.36 still does the same copy perfectly every time.
