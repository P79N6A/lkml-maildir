nice patch! Ack for -mm testing:
Acked-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
one general suggestion: could you rename ->cpu_power to ->__cpu_power? 
That makes it perfectly clear that this field's semantics have changed 
and that it should never be manipulated directly without also changing 
->reciprocal_cpu_power, and will also flag any out of tree code 
trivially.

Could you remove the BUG_ON() - it will most likely cause the 
non-inlining of these functions if CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE=y and 
CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING is disabled (which is a popular combination in 
distro kernels, it reduces the kernel's size by over 30%). And it's not 
like we'll be able to overlook a divide by zero crash in 
reciprocal_value() anyway, if cpu_power were to be zero ;-)
