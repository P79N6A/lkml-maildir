Subject: RTL8139D support for 2.4?

I recently got a local (Australian, NetComm) NIC that uses a 8139D.
The standard 8139too seems to work with it but I wonder if I can
get something more out of a driver that has extra support.
The vendor supplies a driver in
	
http://www.netcomm.com.au/one/support/drivers/NP1100_4.exe
which contains
	np11004.c
This is a modified rtl8139.c, based on a reasonably old version
	1.11 7/14/2000
The latest rtl8139.c I found is
	1.20 6/21/2002
2.4 does not anymore contain the rtl8139.c driver, but has moved
to the 8139too.c
Rather than use a vendor driver, is there support for this chip
in a current (2.4) driver?
Anyone knows the difference between the 8139C and 8139D?
