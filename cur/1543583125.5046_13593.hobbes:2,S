Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The latest drop of JFS was made available today.
The file system has fixes included.
The log manager no longer uses the page cache for log pages, this
eliminates dead-locks that were occurring in the log manager. The file system has
general work done to remove SMP dead-lock problems. fsck now supports default
values passed by fstab correctly. For more details about the problems
fixed, please see the README.
