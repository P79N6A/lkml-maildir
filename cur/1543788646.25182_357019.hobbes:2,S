Sorry for delay - I was very busy during past week.
Well, I guess that thanks to this file I am able to know that the drive is 
connected to via chipset and not to some pseudo raid controller (it is 
important if I am working remotely), if it has 80w cables attached, what 
is attached where, what are controller parameters, dma rate and timings 
(if they are strange I can suspect that something bad is happening with 
the drive / controler).
I am not saying that these data are not available elsewhere (but some are 
not for sure). But they are presented nicely in one standard place and 
this is in my opinion good.
But I understand the desire to remove all files that can be removed from 
/proc. So I am just suggesting to move some of the data (like type of 
cable detected for example) to sysfs if they are not already there.
Thanks,
Grzegorz Kulewski
