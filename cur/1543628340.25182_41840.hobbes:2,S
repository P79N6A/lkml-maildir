That is never going to happen, at least not as long as Linus is the kernel 
maintainer. I believe he has said so more than once before...
One of the reasons being that such an act would make changing global APIs a 
virtual impossiblity. And such changes happen often in Linux during the 
unstable kernel series. And those changes are good changes... Otherwise we 
will end up with Windows having backwards compatibility with DOS for 
virtually all eternity...
Best regards,
Anton
