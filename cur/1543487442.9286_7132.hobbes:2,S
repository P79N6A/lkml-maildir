I had the same problem with a K5 -- I changed a bunch of options
(almost at random) and finally got it to boot.  The options I suspect
the were causing my hangs are one of the following: 
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y
CONFIG_KMOD=n
CONFIG_PNP=n
After I changed only those to:
CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=n
CONFIG_KMOD=y
CONFIG_PNP=y
it booted perfectly (no idea why (or which) as yet).
Hope this helps.
