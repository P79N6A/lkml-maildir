Only if we build _everything_ at once, which may take an insane amount
of RAM. Doing it a directory at a time makes a certain amount of sense,
and tends to combine the most incestuous code -- although maybe
combinations like building arch/$ARCH/kernel/ with kernel/ (and likewise
mm) could be an interesting experiment.
I suspected that most of the 'further savings' to which you refer above
could be achieved more easily with -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections
--gc-sections
