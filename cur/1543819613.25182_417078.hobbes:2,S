Subject: [(resend)patch 0/7] Notify page fault call chain

Hi Andrew,
Currently in the do_page_fault() code path, we call
notify_die(DIE_PAGE_FAULT, ...) to notify the page fault. 
The only interested components for this page fault 
notifications  are  Kprobes  and/or  kdb. Since 
notify_die() is highly overloaded, this  page  fault  
notification  is  currently  being  sent  to  other
components registered with register_die_notifier()  
which  uses  the  same die_chain to loop for all 
the registered components.
In order to optimize the do_page_fault() code path, 
this critical page fault notification is now moved 
to different call chain and the test results conducted
by Robin Holt showed great improvements.
Patches for i386, x86_64, ia64, powerpc and sparc64 follows this mail.
Please apply.
Thanks,
Anil Keshavamurthy
