With disgusting hacks to the existing uwire driver.

I was thinking of replacing the hacks with spi_bitbang stuff;
the txrx_bufs() method is appropriate for MicroWire since it
needs to know whether to read _or_ write, and txrx_word() calls
assume the full-service shift register is available.

Got patch?  :)

Cool.  tsc2101 + uwire will handle H2 (and H3?) also.  The only
API change I know of (== necessariy affects your code) will be
the "spi_transfer.transfer_list" patch, which I'll get out soon.
