Yeah, it does the same on my other laptop (newer HP as opposed
to an old Dell).

Input: atkbd - throttle LED switching
On some boxes keyboard controllers are too slow to withstand
continuous flow of requests to turn keyboard LEDs on and off
and start losing some keypresses or even all of them.
Delay executing of LED switching request if we had another one
withing 50 ms thus easing load on the controller.
