Interesting....
So far even today these things can happen, however they are sufficiently
unlikely the tools don't account for them.
Once a hostile user can cause them things are more of a problem.

I don't see a way that backup and deluser won't need to be modified
to work properly in a system where non-priveleged mounts are allowed,
at least they will need to account for /share.
That said it is clearly a hazard if we enable this functionality by
default.
If we setup a pam module that triggers on login and perhaps when
cron and at jobs run to setup an additional mount namespace I think
keeping applications locked away in their own mount namespace is
sufficient to avoid hostile users from doing unexpected things to
the initial mount namespace.  So unless I am mistake it should be
relatively simple to prevent user space from encountering problems.
That still leaves the question of how we handle systems with an old
user space that is insufficiently robust to deal with mounts occurring
at unexpected locations.
  I think a simple sysctl to enable/disable of non-priveleged mounts 
  defaulting to disabled is enough.
Am I correct or will it be more difficult than just a little pam
module to ensure non-trusted users never run in the initial mount
namespace?
