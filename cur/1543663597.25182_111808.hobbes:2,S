I have some problems with this hardware, too. Maybe I can provide some 
useful bugreports - I'd gladly do some tests with the 2.4.x kernels if 
someone is interested (I only tried 2.4.19 and 2.4.20 with this 
hardware so far).
I have a Tyan S2466N-4M (Tiger MPX, Chipset AMD 760MPX, 762, 768), 
2x Athlon MP 2000+, 
512MB Reg. ECC SDRAM
2-3 IDE drives and a DVD-ROM on the onboard channels
DMA support enabled (I don't like to disable this, because when I copy 
over 100MB from the DVD to a harddrive with DMA disabled the cpu-usage 
wents well above 50% and then the machine _freezes_.)
With 2.4.19, the power-switch didn't work after shutdown (It works now 
with 2.4.20). Automatic power-off (halt -p) doesn't work with neighter 
2.4.19 nor 2.4.20. 
With "AMD 76x native power management" I experienced freezes under X11 
when the system was idle for about 30 min that usually went away when I 
typed on the keyboard. Using the (USB) mouse had no effect. But I had 
no problems at boot-time.
Thomas.
