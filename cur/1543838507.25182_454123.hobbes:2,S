It means XFS detected ondisk corruption in inode# 254474718, and
paniced your system (stupidly; a fix for this is around, will be
merged with the next mainline update).  For me, a more interesting
question is how that inode got into this state... have you had any
crashes recently (i.e. has the filesystem journal needed to be
replayed recently?)  Can you send the output of:
	# xfs_db -c 'inode 254474718' -c print /dev/sdc1
You'll need to run xfs_repair on that filesystem to fix this up,
but please send us that output first.
thanks.
