Unfortunately this won't work, not even for network destinations.
The reason is that this gets called as soon as the destination's
splice hook returns, for networking that means when sendpage returns.
So by that time we'll still be left with just a page reference
on a page where the slab memory may already have been freed.
To make this work we need to get the destination's splice hooks
to acquire this reference.
Cheers,
