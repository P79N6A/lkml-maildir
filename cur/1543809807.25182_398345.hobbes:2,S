Finally, let me explain why I favour the termios solution.  The biggest
(and most important) aspect is that it allows existing applications
such as minicom and gettys to work as expected - getting the correct
handshaking mode that they desire without having to change userspace.
I think that is an _extremely_ important property to have.  Without it,
you would end up with (eg) a security issue where a user changes the
handshaking mode of the dial-up connection they're on, rendering it
useless until the sysadmin "undoes" the damage.
Alternatively, every serial line getty at least needs to be taught
how to reset the handshaking mode, which at present means that it
needs to be taught about the hardware cards so it knows what silly
random ioctl call for some proprietary method to make.
