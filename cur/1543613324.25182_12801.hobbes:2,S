Stephen,
I have tried every imaginable root device out there but with no success.
Thank you though  for all  your emails.  I gave up on RH 7.1
and decided to install RH7.2.  SMP is now enabled only after
configuring the BIOS of Proliant 6000 to "Linux" as the
OS. Now it is working the way we expect it.     I still
have issues with my Fiber Channel but that's not critical at the moment.
There is definitely something screwy with the mkinitrd RPM that was
supplied by RedHat.
Good day,
