Alt-Sysrq-Space will give you a summary, if the system is still alive
enough to accept sysrq.

I suspect it may be another case where the kernel resource subsystem
doesn't actually know the full story of which ports are in use.
Chances are you're hitting some sort of system management port which
is then causing the system to lock up.

You could try finding out exactly which IO port(s) are causing the
problem by tweaking your PCMCIA config.opts file, by doing a binary
search in the affected IO region, and then reporting the result here.
The output of dmidecode and lspci -vxxx may also be useful.
Note that PCMCIA performs IO probes using a granularity of 8 bytes,
so there's no point going below that.
