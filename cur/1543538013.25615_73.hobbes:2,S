But Linus has already stated that the cost in the present form is way too
high for the win. Most kernel gurus agree...

Which give _no_ additional security (some script kiddies are now using
exploits that work even with them applied, just think what will happen if
all kernels are "securized": Esploits will work around that, and the cost
in the kernel stays forever).

That is definitely not your call to make for Linus' own kernel tree.
