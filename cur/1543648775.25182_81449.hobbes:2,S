Sorry, but I fixed up all in-kernel instances of this usage.  If you
want to keep a driver outside of the main kernel tree, you're going to
have to get used to things like this.  In fact, this is a very minor
change, wait until some of the other USB API changes that have happened
in 2.5 get backported to 2.4 :)
Good luck,
