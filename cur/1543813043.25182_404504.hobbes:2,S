Ok. The only thing I have tested is the timing of "outb()" on its own, 
which is definitely long enough that it clearly waits for _some_ bus 
activity (ie the CPU doesn't just post the write internally), but I don't 
know exactly what the rules are as far as the core itself is concerned: I 
suspect the core just waits until it has hit the northbridge or something.
In contrast, a MMIO write to a WC region at least will not necessarily 
pause the core at all: it just hits the write queue in the core, and the 
core continues on (and may generate other writes that will be combined in 
the write buffers before the first one even hits the bus).
