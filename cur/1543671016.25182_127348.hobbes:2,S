I wouldn't say it's what you want. I really rather not have open office
(for eg) killed just because while I could have had the space to suspend
fully I wasn't able. And if it's my only reason for using the laptop at
the time then it just outright dieing might be just as useful.
Have the OOM killing if you want but being able to tack on an extra swap
partition when suspending would be most useful, either out of the kernel
or out of userspace, whichever would be the most reliable.

Martin's distress was in contrast to the bitter satisfaction of some
of his fellow marines as they surveyed the scene. "The Iraqis are sick
people and we are the chemotherapy," said Corporal Ryan Dupre. "I am
starting to hate this country. Wait till I get hold of a friggin' Iraqi.
No, I won't get hold of one. I'll just kill him."
