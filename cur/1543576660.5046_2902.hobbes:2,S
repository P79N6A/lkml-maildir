Subject: 2.2.19pre3 on sparc64: Hangs on boot, "no cont in shutdown!"??

Red Hat 6.2 + updates (plus local hacks, like binutils-2.10.0.33) on
sparc64 (Ultra 1).
When booting, it detects the floppy drive (I left a floppy in by mistake,
the floppy is OK, and the same boots fine with 2.2.18):
  [snip snap]
  Floppy drive(s): fd0 is 1.44M
after this, it just gives the "no cont in shutdown!" message after a few
seconds, and stays stuck AFAICS (not much patience, I'm afraid). This
message is inside drivers/block/floppy.c:floppy_shutdown(), a file that
hasn't changed from 2.2.18 to 2.2.19pre3.
BTW, the floppy here (and also on sparc32) normally gives:
  $ mdir
  init: set default params
  Cannot initialize 'A:'
the first time around, the second time it works OK. A too short timeout in
mtools or in the kernel perhaps?
