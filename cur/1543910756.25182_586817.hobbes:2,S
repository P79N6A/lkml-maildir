Obviously a gcc <= 3.4 [1], and therefore no unit-at-a-time.
You can reproduce it with a more recent gcc when adding 
-fno-unit-at-a-time to the CFLAGS.
And it's becoming a real maintainance problem that not only this problem 
but also other problems like some section mismatches [2] are only 
present without unit-at-a-time.
Currently we support 6 different stable gcc release series, and it might 
be the right time to consider dropping support for the older ones.
Are there any architectures still requiring a gcc < 4.0 ?

[1] unit-at-a-time was added in gcc 3.4, but on gcc 3.4 we disable it on
    i386 due to stack usage problems
[2] example: static __init function with exactly one caller, and this
             caller is non-__init
