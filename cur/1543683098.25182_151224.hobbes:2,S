Which adds one more warning (the third one below) to my build log:
| ide.c:175: warning: `ide_scan_direction' defined but not used
| ide-lib.c:174: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
| binfmt_elf.c:446: warning: `files' might be used uninitialized in this function
Seems to be harmless, though.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
