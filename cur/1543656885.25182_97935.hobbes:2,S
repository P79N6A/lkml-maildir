I presume *%gs:0x18 is only for shared objects?
A naïve:
-               asm volatile("call 0xffffe000"
+               asm volatile("call *%%gs:0x18"
in the trivial getppid benchmark code gives a SEGV, since
(according to gdb's info all-registers) %gs == 0 when it runs.
Is it just that my glibc is too old, or is there a shared vs static difference?

P.S.    On a (1 Gig) mobile p3 the getppid bench gives ~333 cycles for
        int $0x80 and ~215 for call 0xffffe000, before yesterday's push.
