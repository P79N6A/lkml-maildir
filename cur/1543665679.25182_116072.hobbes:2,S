ATAPI scanners? Cool stuff. Seriously, there is cheap ATAPI junk and

Well, some amount of configurability would be nice for the ones of us
who have working ATAPI hardware. Even if it's a boot-time parameter like
"hdc=atapidma" or something (that's what FreeBSD does, with the
boot-time variable hw.ata.atapi_dma, it defaults to 0 but drop
hw.ata.atapi_dma="1" into /boot/loader.conf.local and have the machine
talk DMA to ATAPI stuff). Am I missing such an option?
I am currently facing the choice "switch to some other OS that talks DMA
to my CD-writer" or "buy an ATAPI-SCSI-converter" (which is above 100
EUR). I'd like to have a third option to choose, tell the kernel "forget
your sorrows and talk DMA." -- it could use a (user-space) whitelist,
say "Plextor CD-R   4824TA 1.04 is fine".

/sbin/hdparm -X66 -d1 -u1 happens at boot time (for hdc) -- still I'm
facing unreasonably high system load when writing a CD.
