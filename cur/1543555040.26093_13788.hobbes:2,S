Of course. This list of priorites is very natural, I think:
1. Working SMP driver
2. Broken SMP driver with a warning.
3. Broken SMP driver without a warning. (Even if "everyone" knows it
   is broken)
It takes less than a minute to add such a warning, but it can take days
or weeks to find someone to really fix the driver. That was my point.
