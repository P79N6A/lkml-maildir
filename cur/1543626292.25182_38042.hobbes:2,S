This is a patchkit against Linux 1.0.9, largely based upon Paul
Gortmakers linux-lite patch. Why this new kernel release?
After all the discussions about VFS races and VM problems and growing bloat
in all areas of the kernel people seem to have forgotten the good old days
of the small and simple linux kernels.
Even more important the ego of a young kernel developer will suffer
in the long term if he doesn't have his own kernel patchkit, so here it is:
