This fixes MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS spotted by Jens and Martin, plus it
avoids vmware to crash (but it only warns about the missing VM_RESERVED
bitflag).

Changelog diff between 2.6.5-rc1-aa3 and 2.6.5-rc2-aa1:
Binary files 2.6.5-rc1-aa3/anon_vma.gz and 2.6.5-rc2-aa1/anon_vma.gz differ
	Fixed silly bug in mmap(MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANONYMOUS) and converted a
	BUG_ON to a WARN_ON if some device driver passes non-pageable pages
	to the VM via ->nopage. VM_RESERVED it's not required with current
	VM, so even if the WARN_ON triggers the machine remains completely
	stable.
Only in 2.6.5-rc1-aa3: linus.patch.gz
	Updated to 2.6.5-rc2 so not needed anymore.
