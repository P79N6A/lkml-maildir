Actually, it makes a difference. Backquoting doesn't really have anything 
to do with the problem at all, since make doesn't understand it, it
just puts literally "`date`" into the variable, so you pass
echo "B="`date` to the shell, which will then to the substitution.
(Try
C = `echo all.c`
all: $(C)
it won't compile all, even if there is all.c - backquoting can only work
in the command part of a rule.)
Anyway, A= vs A:=, A += $(shell ...) behaves differently, as I 
conjectured. Example:
VAR =
#VAR :=
VAR += $(shell echo $$RANDOM)
all:
	@echo $(VAR)
	@echo $(VAR)
Not that it really matters...
