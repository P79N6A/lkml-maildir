Hi,
It maybe a bit off topic, but I just tried to compile latest
2.6.14-rc2 with new gcc-4.1 (stage 3:
http://gcc.gnu.org/develop.html#stage3
). I have noticed some warnings
(in example):
usr/initramfs_data.S: Assembler messages:
usr/initramfs_data.S:1: Warning: line numbers must be positive; line
number 0 rejected
This maybe a gcc issue.

kernel/sched.c: In function 'yield':
kernel/sched.c:4069: warning: value computed is not used
void __sched yield(void)
{
	set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING);
	sys_sched_yield();
}
I found this while googling: 
http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/1998-04/msg00810.html
What's wrong? TASK_RUNNING is definition from include/linux/sched.h
