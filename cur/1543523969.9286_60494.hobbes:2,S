hmm... i'm not an expert on building distros, but i don't think you should
be installing a fresh set of headers unless you rebuild glibc.
i just grabbed a copy of linux-2.3.41 and glibc-2.1.2 and did a quick build
(athlon rules :-)   and some of the glibc test programs in 'make check'
spit out that same warning.
it seems that the linux definition of RLIM_INFINITY got moved into
<asm/resource.h> from <linux/resource.h> (which i assume is the internal
counterpart to <bits/resource.h>?)  also, it is *right* before an
#ifdef KERNEL.  should RLIM_INFINITY be moved inside the ifdef KERNEL, or
maybe back into <linux/resource.h>?
