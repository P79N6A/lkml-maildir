Hi all,
Thanks for the workaround on the Dell 5000e APM problems.
However, there does seem to be a small typo in the patch.  The
comments state that the A04 BIOS dates 08/24/2000 is known defective,
but the code itself is looking for 08/04/2000.
With this small fix it actually "Works for Me" (well, minus the power
status stuff of course) but at least I get real working suspend/resume.
Later,
Tom
