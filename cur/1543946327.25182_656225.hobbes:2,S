That or to me or to dwmw2...  I'm not too picky about the path, as long
as it gets merged eventually.

For module unload we should be safe.  Errors are only returned if the
device doesn't exist (a clear bug) or if the device is still being used.
Module refcounting should prevent the latter case, so either way we have
a bug if del_mtd_device returns an error.
When removing the device via your proposed interface we should simply
return the error to userspace, if the interface permits.  Sysfs doesn't
seem to permit error returns, so we should keep the device alive and do
nothing.

Agreed, sysfs' lack of error indication isn't ideal.

Could work.  Passing the fd raises several alarm bells.  Arnd, any
comments from you?
In general I'd like to see some good reasons for adding an ioctl (or any
other) interface first.  Creating interfaces is hard and you rarely get
a second chance to fix the mess you created before you knew all the
consequenses.

There may be.  Can you check if there is?

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are,
by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
