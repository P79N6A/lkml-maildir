Some people find the blinking text cursor equally annoying, you appear to be 
trying to dictate what their options should be.

Ask the original poster if he's willing to take the risk of going with an xor 
cursor.  We are talking text mode, right?  No way to get rid of that blinking 
text cursor, ever.  Tell me, do you like having the colon blink on your alarm 
clock too?  Personally, I opened the thing up and put a piece of tape over it.
As I recall, one of the popular projects when the IBM PC first came out was 
trying to get the cursor to stop blinking.  No luck, IBM had hardwired in a
special trace to make sure you couldn't.  You could or two blink patterns 
together, but never get it to stop.  Since we are now in a position to 
dictate, why don't we continue that grand tradition.
IBM had lots of ideas about how computers should work.  Remember the keyboard 
keys that when CLACK CLACK CLACK.  Thank god they turned out to be too 
expensive to clone - nobody misses them now.
When people ask for such options it's not because they want to make *your* 
cursor stop blinking, it's because they want *theirs* to stop.
