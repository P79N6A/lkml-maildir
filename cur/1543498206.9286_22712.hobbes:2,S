The kernel tree. Remember Linux is GPL. If yo are trying to write GPL code
for Linux drivers you are actively encouraged to start with the nearest
similar driver and use it to hack your driver.

I don't know enough about windows internals to know what VCOMM provides. If
its upper layer interfaces to serial drivers then it is analogous to the
line disciplines in unix and linux
