Red Hat did a 2.4.2 release which was 2.4.2 + a lot of stability changes.
IIRC, RH7.x was based on 2.4.7, with updates to 2.4.9, 2.4.18 and finally
2.4.20-based kernels.  However, I also seem to remember each of these had
a fair number of patches applied.
I'm sure Arjan will correct me if I got the above wrong.
