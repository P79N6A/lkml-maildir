This is changes what sr1 is mapped to without specicying any option.
The default _must_ be 0 partitions or existing setups will break.
+MODULE_PARM(partitions, "i");
please make this module_param so it works at boot-time aswell.
+MODULE_PARM_DESC(partitions, "number of SCSI CDROM partitions to support");
+	/* Check number of partitions specified. */
+	if (partitions < 0)
+		partitions = 0;
now if you made the variable 'unsigned' you wouldn't have that problem..
While you're at it please also cook up an ide-cd variant, having partitions
only supported on scsi cdroms is more than confusing.
