Hi!
Sorry Alexey for keeping it quiet but I got pulled away to some other duties for 
the past 3 weeks.
Anyway, the similar problem I was reporting has not been seen since that last 
incident a month ago. We did change, on our application side, some of the 
parameters (aka SO_RCVBUF) that did not need to be set in the first place (bug 
on our side).
This plus your patch seem to have resolve the issues we were having. So, it's 
all good !
Thanks again..
Guillaume.
