Assuming you have already configured your kernel and previously compiled
it then no questions should be asked. - The way I work is to do make
bzImage, try it, modify. make bzImage, try, etc... No questions asked.
If you did an accidental make mrproper or make clean in between then make
a copy of you old .config (I keep mine in /usr/src/my2.4.4config for
example so I would do from /usr/src/linux: cp ../my2.4.4config .config)
then run make oldconfig
followed by make dep && make bzImage
In future don't do a make mrproper or clean for that matter. All modified
files are automatically recompiled while non-modified ones are taken from
old compile. - This saves incredible amounts of time when using a Pentium
133 for development...
