Thanks. Unfortunately, looking at the refactorized ACPI code in 
2.6.18-rc4, there are still issues with sleeping functions called with 
disabled interrupts (during resume), in ACPI code.
Two random examples:
- when acpi_pci_link_set() is called during resume (local irqs off), the 
following callchain happens, which is bad: acpi_pci_link_resume -> 
acpi_pci_link_set -> acpi_set_current_resources -> 
acpi_rs_set_srs_method_data -> acpi_ns_evaluate -> acpi_ns_get_node .. 
here the mutex is acquired. Not good. 
- device_power_up -> sysdev_resume -> __sysdev_resume -> cpufreq_resume -> 
blocking_notifier_call_chain -> down on semaphore. Not good.
Is there any general idea for solution?
