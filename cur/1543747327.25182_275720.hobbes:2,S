/dev/mem *is* physical.
[Jon M. Hanson] I can read /dev/mem from a userspace application as root
with no problems and print out what it sees. However, things are not so
simple from a kernel module as I just can't call open() and read() on
/dev/mem because no such functions are exported from the kernel. Is
there a way to read the contents of /dev/mem from a kernel module?
