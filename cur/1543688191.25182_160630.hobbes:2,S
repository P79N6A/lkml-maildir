I didn't really understand this one. What Werner says seems correct 
though. For recursive tasklets one of the two things are bound to happen. 
Either the tasklet_kill hangs (which will happen on UP) or one (read last)
tasklet_schedule is not honoured (which will happen on SMP). On SMP the 
user context tasklet_kill gets a chance to exit the 
"while (test_bit(TASKLET_STATE_SCHED, &t->state))" loop as it gets a 
chance to run parallely with tasklet_action in the small window (during 
which TASKLET_STATE_SCHED is not set) that I mentioned in one of my 
earlier mails.
So I believe that at least one (to be precise, the last one called before 
tasklet dies) tasklet_schedule is not honoured.
Thanx,
tomar
