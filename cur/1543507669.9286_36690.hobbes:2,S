Have you tried throwing out the knfsd-lock patch, and just running
with the stock lockd stuff (no userland rpc.lockd required)?
The userland rpc.lockd + kernel patch should really only be needed as
a hack for NFSroot systems and for people who can't afford to start
rpc.statd before mounting an NFS partition.

Which automounter is this? I have no such problems with 'autofs'.
If you're using am-utils or amd, first try using autofs as an
alternative. (You will lose the '/net' stuff, but since you said that
didn't work...) If that shows your problem to be with am-utils/amd
then please contact the maintainer of that package.
