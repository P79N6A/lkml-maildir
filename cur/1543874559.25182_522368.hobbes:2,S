I hope by Greg's queue you meant:
<ftp:ftp.kernel.org:/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/gregkh-2.6/patches>
As that's the tree I just pulled in and put in /usr/src/patches with gftp.

I do too, but I'm now less than 2 hours from the backup run, which with 
this currently running kernel, should be a sane one.
?  Since this will start with a patch level of a 2.6.20.3 kernel (or is 
that patch level a mistaken assumption on my part, but I haven't reversed 
the 2.6.20.4-rc1 patch yet, that's next.), and I have to edit both the 
Makefile and my 'makeit' script so the names all match, what makes a good 
naming convention while I'm doing this?  This might all be clear once I 
read the quilt manpage, which I haven't had a chance to do yet.
That is next, after I reverse that patch.
