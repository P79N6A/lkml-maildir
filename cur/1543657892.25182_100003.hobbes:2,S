Pat, I need your help tracking this one down... :-)
Your recent patch creating find_bus("scsi") always returns NULL.  I see
that's because bus_subsys.list is empty.  Now, why is it empty, when the
SCSI driver did a bus_register()?  It comes down to the code in
kobject_add(), where struct subsystem *s = kobj->subsys == NULL, thus the
list_add_tail code never gets called in there.  
The calls go something like this:
scsi_sysfs_register()
  bus_register(&scsi_bus_type)
    subsystem_register(scsi_bus_type->subsys)
      subsystem_init()
         kobject_init()  sets kobj->subsys = subsys_get(kobj->subsys)  which
seems wrong
	kobject_register()
	  kobject_add() where kobject->subsys is NULL
Strange, but true, and it may be kobject_init() that's borked setting
kobj->subsys.
Please advise.
Thanks,
Matt
