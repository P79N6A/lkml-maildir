I hope you are aware that any of those applications may screw up your
system under load. In case such application does read() into buffer
and unmaps that buffer from other thread, result may be anything - we
are talking about random memory corruption.
I hope you are feeling safe ;-).

PS: What is configuration of your system? I'm using 386/40, 8Meg ram,
and was unable to get reasonable performance even from X alone (well,
X started about 1 minute and crashed my hercules in about 2 minutes -
that was unacceptable :-)
