6.2.1.
The device shall consider the CBW valid when:
- The CBW was recieved when the device had sent a CSW or after a reset
Sending two requests without reading the CSW in between is illegal.
So a storage device can only execute one command at a time.
As you have to evaluate the CSW just queuing the requests buys you little
and in terms of memory allocation is worse.
Besides, this applies only to the bulk only protocol variant and the storage
driver shall be universal.
