Subject: [RFC][PATCH] Update REPORTING-BUGS

Hi,
The recent "kernel bugzilla is FPOS" thread made me think that it might be a
good idea to update REPORTING-BUGS, so that it's more "friendly" to people who
want to report a kernel bug for the first time.
The patch below does that, but it's more a means to spark a discussion than
anything else.
Comments are obviously welcome. :-)
Greetings,
Rafael

+Reporting Linux kernel bugs
 
+What follows is a recommended procedure for reporting bug in the Linux kernel.
+Still, you are not obliged to use the suggested bug reporting format, it is
+provided as a guide to the kind of information that can be useful to developers.
+
+In general, the kernel developers' preferred way of reporting bugs is email,
+because it allows them to react quickly to the problems that are easy to fix.
+Still, later on, if the reported problem turns out to be difficult, you may be
+asked to open an entry in the kernel Bugzilla at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 .
+Usually, this requires you to do some more work than just sending an email
+message with a bug report, but it often is necessary to collect all information
+related to the reported bug in one place, so that it is easily accessible at
+any time later.
+
+Email messages containing bug reports should generally be sent to the
+Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org> and to the
+mailing list dedicated to the affected subsystem.  You may send a bug report to
+three mailing lists simultaneously, if you think that it is necessry.
+[However, if you send them to more than three lists at a time, people will
+likely get angry with you.]
+
+It also is a good idea to notify the maintainer of the affected subsystem and
+the maintainer of the tree in which the bug is present by adding their email
+addresses to the Cc list of the bug report message.  The email addresses of
+maintainers of the majority of kernel subsystems can be found in the MAINTAINERS
+file, but you should not worry too much about getting a wrong person.
+
+If you know which patch has caused the problem to appear, you should also add
+the email address of its author to the Cc list of your bug report (this address
+is usually present in the 'From:' field of the patch header).  Additionally,
+it is recommended to notify all of the people involved in the process of
+merging the patch (you can find their addresses in the 'Signed-off-by:' and
+'Acked-by:' or 'Reviewed-by:' fields of the patch header).  This way you can
+increase the probability that someone "in the know" will notice the report and
+respond to it quickly.  Apart from this, you should make it clear that your
+message contains a bug report, for example by adding the word "BUG" in front
+of the message's subject line.  If the bug is a regression (ie. one of the
+previous kernel versions worked correctly), please put the word "REGRESSION" in
+there instead.
+
+Unfortunately, sometimes bug reports are not responded to even if they contain
+all of the right email addresses etc.  If that happens to your bug report, you
+should first check if it has not been intercepted by a spam filter.  This is
+easy if you have sent the report to a mailing list, since in that case it only
+is necessary to look into the list's archives to see if the message is there.
+If it turns out that the report has reached the list and no one is responding to
+it, the developers might have overlooked it or they may be too busy to take care
+of it right now.  In that case you should wait for some time (usually, a couple
+of days) and send it once again (if you resend the report, you may add the word
+"resend" to the message's subject to indicate that this is not the first time).
+If that does not help and there still is no response, it is best to open a new
+entry in the Bugzilla at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 .  If you have already done
+that, send messages to the appropriate lists and people periodically to remind
+of the issue.
+
+As far as the contents of bug reports are concerned, you should generally avoid
+putting irrelevant information into them.  Of course, that may be difficult,
+because you may not know which information is relevant in given particular case.
+Still, you can always safely assume that if more information is needed, you will
+be asked to provide it.
+
+First of all, you need to say what the bug is, which kernel version it is
+present in and how to reproduce it.  You also need to describe the symptoms and
+include all of the corresponding kernel messages, if you can collect them.  In
+particular, if the failure includes an "Oops:" type message in your log or on
+screen please read "Documentation/oops-tracing.txt" before posting your bug
+report. This explains what you should do with the "Oops" information to make it
+useful to the recipient.
+
+Generally, the following things are appreciated in a bug report:
+
+* One line summary of the reported problem
+* Description of the problem
+* Version of the kernel in which the problem appears
+* The last known version of the kernel in which the problem does not appear (if
+  applicable)
+* Architecture of the system on which the problem is observed (that may
+  include some more detailed hardware information if the problem seems to be
+  hardware-related)
+* Steps to reproduce the problem
+* Kernel messages related to the problem (if available)
+* Concise description of software environment in which the problem appears (as
+  per the output of scripts/ver_linux)
+
+Additionally, if you know which patch has introduced the problem, the name of it
+or the corresponding git commit name should be included in the report.  [Please
+read Documentation/BUG-HUNTING to learn how you can find the "guilty" patch.]
+
+The version of the kernel can be read from the output of scripts/ver_linux or
+directly from /proc/version .  Still, if you use git to download the kernel
+sources, you can obtain more precise version information by running
+'git describe' from within the root of the kernel source directory.
+
+After reporting a bug you may be provided with a patch to test.  In that case
+you ought to test it and report back to the developer who have sent it to you
+whether or not it fixes the bug.  If it does not fix the bug, you will likely
+receive more patches to test.  In any case, please be patient and work with the
+developers until the issue is resolved.
 
 Thank you
