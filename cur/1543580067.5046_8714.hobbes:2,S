Stephen Tweedie has a rather funky i/o stats enhancement patch which
should provide what you need. It comes with RedHat7.0 and gives decent
disk statistics in /proc/partitions.
Unfortunately this patch is not yet in the 2.2 or 2.4 kernel. I'd like to
see it make the kernel as a 2.4.x item. Failing that, it'll probably make
the 2.5 kernel.
Cheers
Chris
