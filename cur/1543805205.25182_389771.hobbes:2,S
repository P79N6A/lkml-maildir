Your e820 memory map shows the first 2GB of RAM is at 0-2GB and the 
remaining 2GB is at 4-6GB, so yes there is a hole. This doesn't explain 
why all of 0-4GB is set as write-back and then the top half of it is 
also set as uncacheable. This will presumably have been set up by the 
BIOS though, I don't think the kernel does this.

Just because there is MMIO there, does not mean it can be safely set as 
write combining. For devices that support write combining, I believe 
it's the responsibility of the driver (or in the case of a graphics 
card, X) to set this up if it wants. Generally this is only done for 
graphics cards due to the limited number of MTRR entries.

Sounds like X is doing something reasonable, that range shouldn't have 
been set as write-back in the first place. Presumably the fault of the 
BIOS however.
