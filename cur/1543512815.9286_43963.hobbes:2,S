You will notice that the second region is 128k short of a full 63meg.  (63 +
1 = 64).  When you set the command line to 64M, the system tries to use some
memory that the bios is not making available as regular memory.  Crash is
inevitable.  This is why I have been unhappy with advice on the list to
"Just set mem= to however much memory you have."
If you like, you could try  mem=65408K. (64M - 128k)  Another option would
be to turn ACPI off & see how it goes.
That NVS reserved memory is interesting.  (That's the type 4 region at the
end.)  Since Linux does not currently recognize NVS memory (and if it did, I
don't know how it would address that range), any operation looking like an
ACPI sleep is likely too be a bad thing...
