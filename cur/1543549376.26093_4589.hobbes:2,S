Hi n' stuff,
Around 2.4.0-test9-pre2 (or so, definitely in pre3) both my SCSI scanner
and trident sound card stopped being happy.  They are still both broken
in pre5.  On test8, both work perfectly.
On test8:
(scsi0:6:0) Synchronous Data Transfer Request was rejected
  Vendor:           Model: Scanner           Rev: 1.70
  Type:   Scanner                            ANSI SCSI revision: 04
Detected scsi generic sg0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 6, lun 0, type 6
(scsi1:0:3:0) Synchronous at 8.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 31.
  Vendor: YAMAHA    Model: CRW4416S          Rev: 1.0e
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi1, channel 0, id 3, lun 0
scsi : detected 1 SCSI cdrom total.
sr0: scsi3-mmc drive: 16x/16x writer cd/rw xa/form2 cdda tray
... on test9pre5 and test9pre3:
(scsi0:6:0) Synchronous Data Transfer Request was rejected
  Vendor:           Model: Scanner           Rev: 1.70
  Type:   Scanner                            ANSI SCSI revision: 04
(scsi0:0:3:0) Synchronous at 8.0 Mbyte/sec, offset 31.
  Vendor: YAMAHA    Model: CRW4416S          Rev: 1.0e
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02

("Detected scsi generic..." line missing.)
The trident driver appears to be working, but the mixer (ac97_codec?)
appears to always keep everything muted, even though programs let the
levels be apparently adjusted.  Turning up the volume all the way on my
receiver lets me hear some very faint sound leaking through, which sounds
like a mixer problem instead of a playback problem.  An ALSA CVS snapshot
works fine.
