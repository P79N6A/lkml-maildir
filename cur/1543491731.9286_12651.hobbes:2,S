Hello!
My problem is that my FAT16 partitions work well with msdos module, but not
well with umsdos. With 2.0.36 it always was o.k.
any time I try to modify or create in umsdos fs I get error messages like:
in /var/log/messages
 kernel: UMSDOS_notify_change: no EMD file //--linux-.---
cp: cannot create regular file `./try': Operation not permitted  
So what should I do to fix it?
Why can't it automatically create that index file?
( kernel: UMSDOS dentry-pre 0.84 (compatibility level
0.4, fast msdos)          
(Sorry I'm not on the list)
Would you send a fix-patch? 
Thanx.
