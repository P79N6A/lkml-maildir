Subject: [patch 2/8] PCI Error Recovery: header file patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/23/255

Various PCI bus errors can be signaled by newer PCI controllers. Recovering 
from those errors requires an infrastructure to notify affected device drivers 
of the error, and a way of walking through a reset sequence.  This patch adds 
a set of callbacks to be used by error recovery routines to notify device 
drivers of the various stages of recovery.
