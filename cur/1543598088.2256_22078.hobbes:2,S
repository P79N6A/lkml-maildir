How about something like:
In ../asm/signal.h  (for i386)
#define PT_REGS_ENTRY(type,name,p1_type,p1, p2_type,p2) \
type name(p1_type p1,p2_typ p2)\
{	struct pt_regs *regs = (struct pt_regs *)&p1;
#define _do_signal() do_signal(regs, NULL)
in ../asm_arm/signal.h
#define PT_REGS_ENTRY(type,name,p1_type,p1, p2_type,p2) \
type name(p1_type p1,p2_typ p2, struct pt_regs *regs) \
{
#define _do_signal() do_signal(NULL,regs, NULL)
and other archs as needed.
in ../linux/signal.h  (the default)
:
#include <asm/signal.h>
:
:
#ifndef PT_REGS_ENTRY
#define PT_REGS_ENTRY(type,name,p1_type,p1, p2_type,p2) \
type name(p1_type p1,p2_typ p2)\
{
#define _do_signal() 1
#endif
and finally in nano_sleep :
PT_REGS_ENTRY(asmlinkage long,sys_nanosleep,struct timespec
*,rqtp,struct timespec *,rmtp)
	struct timespec t;
	unsigned long expire;
:
: etc...
:
	do {
                current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
        } while((expire = schedule_timeout(expire)) && !_do_signal());
The notion is that this could be used for other system calls, in
particular I want to implement clock_nanosleep() as part of the extended
POSIX standard.
Comments, flames,...
