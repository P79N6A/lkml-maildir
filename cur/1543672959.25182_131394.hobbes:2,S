s/uint32_t/u32/ please.
And if this is going to be used for pointers, why not just say they are
pointers?  Otherwise people are going to have to be careful with 32 vs.
64 bit kernels to not overrun their space.
struct sk_buff uses a char, any reason not to use that here too?  Has
being a char made things more difficult for that structure over time?
thanks,
