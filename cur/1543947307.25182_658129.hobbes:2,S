Perhaps it's more useful to have git become more content aware.
If git could track user specified file glob pattern ("*.[ch]$")
changes by statement terminator (";") and git could format
output by a user specified pass (lindent), many of the bike shed
paint discussions and a lot of commits would never occur.
