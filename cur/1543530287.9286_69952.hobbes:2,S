	_Please_, do it - that would solve the whole problem. Nobody argues
against using the term in the meaning you are using it. The _only_ problem
is that your text refers to Plan 9 definition and uses totally different
one. If you replace the reference to Pike et.al. with one that would not
give conflicting meaning of the term - all problems are solved.
	For anyone who knows about Plan 9 the combination "Plan 9" and
"namespaces" immediately implies "namespace as a binding of unified tree
from individual filesystems (as in UNIX), but unlike UNIX different
processes can have different namespaces". So the first reaction on pointer
to Plan 9 papers in your text is "HUH? How the heck does he do it inside
the filesystem driver", the second "Hey, he describes something completely
different, where does he see any connection with Plan 9 meaning?" and then
come, erm, unflattering ones...
