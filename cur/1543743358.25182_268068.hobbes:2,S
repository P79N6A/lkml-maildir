Subject: [patch 08/20] uml: mconsole_proc simplify and partial fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Gerd Knorr <kraxel@bytesex.org>, and me, Paolo Giarrusso
This is a rewrite of the mconsole_proc function.
The old code had the problem that the kernel crashed after calling
"uml_mconsole proc <somefile>" a few times.  I havn't tracked what
exactly causes the problem, I guess trying to access the procfs without
actually mounting it somewhere causes some corruption of kernel data
structures.
The new code simply openes /proc/<file> via sys_open().  That simplifies
the function alot.  It also doesn't crash any more ;)
Also, from Paolo Giarrusso:
When printing the content of a file through the "proc" command, make
it begin on his own line.
PROBLEMS:
Drawback is that it only works when procfs is actually mounted below
/proc. And within UML, often this is false, because when building honeypots we
mount HPPFS under /proc to avoid the hacker recognizing he's attacking a UML
instance.
One suggestion I've received to fix the later issue was to mount
the procfs within a kernel thread with a private namespace, but I havn't
tried that so far.
Instead, we'd like to fix the actual code of the mconsole_proc function. From
"Anthony Brock" Anthony_Brock (at) ous (dot) edu comes a comment, suggesting
where the bug lays (as noted in the source): removing part of the code (it
seems the symlink lookup) there are no more crashes.
