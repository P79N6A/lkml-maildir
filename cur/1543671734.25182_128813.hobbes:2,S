  You are trying to make the case that open source developers are in the
same group as those who illegally download copyrighted media, but you
are wrong.  Taking ideas and concepts from the "daemon book" or "The
Design of OS/2" or whatever and putting them in Linux is not a crime,
nor is buying a program and trying to clone its functionality.  Copying
the source or object code is something entirely different.
