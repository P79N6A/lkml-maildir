Right, we don't need another dozen of attempts to get it wrong.
Interestingly enough some talks at ELC were using UIO already for
testing and prototyping and the feedback from these guys was positive on
the technical side and not at all focussed on the ability to do closed
source hackery.

It's not necessarily slower. We were able to optimize an application by
using UIO and we got >20% performance gain, due to the fact that we can
operate on the device directly instead of copying data back and forth
between kernel and userspace for no good reason.
Removing the insane amount of 68 ioctls of the original in kernel
driver, which are just there to flip some bit in the chip registers is
definitely a win.
Having a sane user space driver instead of an eye-cancer causing kernel
driver and a user space library, which needs to hide the ioctl madness
away from the application programmer reduced the overall code size from
5264 lines of kernel code + 3275 lines of user space code
to 
 156 lines of kernel code + 2970 lines of user space code.

UIO is not targeted on devices which are part of a kernel subsystem, it
is targeted for self contained special devices, which have currently
tons of out of tree drivers with an average quality of 0. Those devices
do not fit in the in kernel driver landscape at all and we really should
give those folks something sane to work from.

Right, you can do closed source drivers and I prefer when people use
this interface instead of fiddling with faked licenses and creating
legal bordercases. 
All drivers we did so far have LGPL user space counterparts and that's
the preferred way to go.
Also we have the user space driver support for USB already and I have
not seen negative impact from this one yet.

Ack.
