Well, I really don't want people to act dynamically differently depending 
on whether they can sleep or not. That makes static sanity-testing 
impossible. So I really think that the only really valid use of the above 
is on one single place: might_sleep().
Which right now doesn't do the "irqs_disabled()" test, but otherwise looks 
good. So the code should really just say
	if (gfp_mask & __GFP_WAIT)
		might_sleep();
and might_sleep() should be updated.
Anybody want to try that and see whether things break horribly?
