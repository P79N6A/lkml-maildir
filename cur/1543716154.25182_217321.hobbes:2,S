Maybe the kernel should be told by the apps exactly what they require in 
the way of memory and maybe how to slice up what the app gets for memory 
from the kernel.
This would not be the first time that applications had to specify such 
information.
That was what REGION= and other such parameters were all about in other 
operating systems.
Then the kernel would have free use of what was left until the next app 
started etc ....
Cheers,
