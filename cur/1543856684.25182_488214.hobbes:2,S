erp, please don't touch that code.
The writev deadlock fixes which went into 2.6.17 trashed writev()
performance and Nick and I are slowly trying to get it back, while fixing
the has-been-there-forever pagefault-in-write() deadlock.
This is all proving very hard to do, and we don't need sweeping code
cleanups happening under our feet ;)
I'll bring those patches back in next -mm, but not very confidently.
