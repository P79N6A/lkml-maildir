IIRC, it is a standard according to the FHS.   Please let's not get started 
on the RPM v. Apt debate.

You know, it's funny how people think.  I'm sure that  we all have had some 
ideas which appear goofy to others, esp. at first blush.   I think that 
creativity requires that thoughts sometimes be juxtaposed in a goofy manner;
usually it  creates garbage, but sometimes it's like peanut butter and 
chocolate. :-)
That much said, a good system administrator should be able to handle this
situation without having to rely on RPM.   The fact that that RedHat ships 
everything defaulted to i386 (except the kernel) is just one more proof of 
good thinking.  If you know what you're doing, then Mandrake i586 is good, 
but can be a rude awakening for newbies, which is Mandrake's target it
would seem.
IMHO, for ordinary day to day tasks, the gains from compiling -m[4|5|6] are
not worth the effort and extra administrative work.
