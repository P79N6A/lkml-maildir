The cciss driver is for our next generation of array controllers.  
Besides adding the complexity of a single driver, there is also a question
of regression testing a single driver.  The  cpqarray driver has support for
all our controllers back to the EISA based controllers.

		Often its easier for the driver author to copy and modify an
existing
		driver, rather than spending the time to design and test a
single driver
		which supports all flavors of the target hardware...
		For Compaq specifically, talk to the driver maintainer
		(arrays@compaq.com), he is actively maintaining the driver.
