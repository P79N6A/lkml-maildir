Good :-)
I asked the question because I considered (and started but didn't
have time) doing what you have done. I wanted to generalise the rt_mutex
to have real rw_lock as well - which was dropped due to the
non-deterministc behavioir even with PI. To do that I needed to have the
recursion and the callback..
