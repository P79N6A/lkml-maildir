| This patch addresses the backward compatibility with device nodes

| 
| SCSI has 16 majors. Each major supports 16 disks currently.

If there's any chance that TOTAL_SD_DISKS is not a multiple of
BITS_PER_LONG, then the value above should better be
	(TOTAL_SD_DISKS + BITS_PER_LONG - 1) / BITS_PER_LONG
