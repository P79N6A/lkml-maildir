Subject: [PATCH] make ipv4 multicast packets only get delivered to sockets that are joined to group
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/13/78

The situation is this:
Two programs have opened IPv4 UDP sockets, set SO_REUSEADDR on them, and
are bound to INADDR_ANY on the same port. One program joins a multicast
group address, the other program joins a different one. When a multicast
packet is sent to this port on one of the group addresses to which these
sockets are bound, both sockets get delivered a copy of the packet. Only
the socket that is bound to the group address to which the packet was
sent should get it.
The issue seems to be that there is no actual check to see if the socket
is joined to the multicast group. This patch adds such a check, and
corrected the problem on my test rig.
I looked briefly at the ipv6 equivalent code, and it appears to already
handle this correctly with a check near the top of inet6_mc_check(). I
have not actually verified this, however.
This patch should apply cleanly to Linus' git tree as of last night.
