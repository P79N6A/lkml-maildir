Hi,
a patch by Alexander Viro:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/diffs/fs/partitions/osf.c@1.4
changed the naming scheme of OSF partitions: empty partitions are now
skipped, whereas previously the partition number would always
correspond directly to the number in the partition table. E. g, if you
have partition a and d, you end up with hda1 and hda2 instead of hda1
and hda4.
I wonder whether that is intended? Is there any problem with
non-continguous partition numbers in 2.5?
