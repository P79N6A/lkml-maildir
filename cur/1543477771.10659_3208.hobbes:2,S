Looking at the asm code closely, it becomes clear that only %ebx is free to
hold the ct pointer; I would therefore apply the following path (don't get
confused -- all that really changes is the "g" into a "b", but breaking the
long line and aligning the input operands with the outputs that occupy the
same space seemed reasonable to me).
