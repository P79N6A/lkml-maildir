Currently this code is called from the interrupt code in timer.  At this
time the xtime(write) lock is held and interrupts are off.
It could also be called from the "bh" section of timer.c at which time
the interrupts are on and the xtime lock is not held.
In either case, the state of the interrupt system is known and the the
irq_save version of the spin lock need not be used.  (Hay a cycle is a
cycle.)  
But more to the point, could the call(s) be made from the "bh" section
and thus inprove interrupt latency, not to mention xtime lock
contention.
Also, if a 250ms tick is needed, you might consider a timer (which is
also called from the "bh" code).
