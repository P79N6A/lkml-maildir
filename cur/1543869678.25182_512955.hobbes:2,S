OK, I will bite...
Why doesn't the traditional hash table of locks work here?  Use the
cache-line address as input to the hash function, take the corresponding
lock, do the compare-and-exchange by hand, and then release the lock.
What am I missing here?  Address aliasing do to memory being mapped into
multiple locations or something?  (In that case, use only the portion
of the address within the page, right?)
I will agree that cmpxchg() has been abused pretty thoroughly in
some venues, but it does have legitimate uses.
