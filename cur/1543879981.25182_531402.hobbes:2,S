Yes.  But I think we've already establish that the on-disk structure
chosen by ext3/htree is not able to perfectly support NFS (which is a
pity given that it was written for Linux and Linux is thought to
support NFS).  Our goal is to find the best mapping possible and,
where caching can improve stability for real-world uses, use caching
to help stabilise that mapping.

You have provided some very helpful insights into how ext3/htree
currently works - thanks for that.
I will definitely make a closer inspection of the code and so how
possible it is to realise by ideas.  I'll let you know how I go.
