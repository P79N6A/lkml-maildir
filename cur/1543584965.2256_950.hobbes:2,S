    RedHat distribute mount separately from util-linux and I wouldnae be
    surprised if others do the same...
I am not aware of any distribution that ships some version of
util-linux, but replaces its mount part by an older version.
I think that even in cases where, because of historical reasons, util-linux
is repackaged in several parts, mount --version gives the right answer.

    Not on RedHat systems.
There is no other source. Some people like to repack but that
has no influence on versions.

    Neither am I. The ver_linux script has lines for determining the
    versions for both Console Tools and Kbd but on EVERY system I've
    tried, including Slackware, RedHat, Debian, Caldera, and SuSE based
    ones, the line for determining Kbd versiondoesnae work. I've just
    included the line that worked, and ignored the Kbd one as I can see no
    point including something that doesnae work.
You are mistaken, as is proved by the reports that contain a kbd line:
a grep on linux-kernel for this Februari shows people with
Kbd 0.96, 0.99 and 1.02.
