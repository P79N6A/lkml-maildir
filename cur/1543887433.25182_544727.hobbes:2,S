Hi!
Since 2.6.21 I have a problem with the it821x driver on my ITE 8212
controller.
Now I saw some updates to it821x in 2.6.22-rc1 and gave that a try, but
the problem persists.
It seems that DMA is broken on it8212 somehow since the merge of
the it8213 driver.
dmesg shows some BUG DMA OFF:

------------------------>8-----------------------
Until 2.6.20 (since 2.6.10) the driver worked quite fine, but since
2.6.21 moving/copying files from/to any drive on the controller is 
a) really slow, 
b) music starts skipping, 
c) mouse stopps moving for short periods, 
and hdparm does not work anymore:
# hdparm -d1 /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
 setting using_dma to 1 (on)
 HDIO_SET_DMA failed: Input/output error
 using_dma     =  0 (off)
This has not been a problem before. hdparm -tT showed something around
40MB/s for buffered reads, now it looks like this:
# hdparm -tT /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
 Timing cached reads:   356 MB in  2.01 seconds = 177.30 MB/sec
HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(null) (wait for flush complete) failed: Input/output
error 
 Timing buffered disk reads:   10 MB in  3.28 seconds =   3.05 MB/sec 
HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(null) (wait for flush complete) failed: Input/output
error
