Subject: [PATCH 0/3] stack overflow safe kdump (2.6.18-rc1-i386)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
This is a the first of a series of patch-sets aiming at making kdump
more robust against stack overflows.
This patch set does the following:
* Add safe_smp_processor_id function to i386 architecture (this function
was inspired by the x86_64 function of the same name).
* Substitute "smp_processor_id" with the stack overflow-safe
"safe_smp_processor_id" in the reboot path to the second kernel.
List of patches (the last two should be applied in the order of
appearance):
[1/5] safe_smp_processor_id: stack overflow safe implementation of
smp_processor_id.
[2/5] crash_use_safe_smp_processor_id: replace smp_processor_id with
safe_smp_processor_id in "arch/i386/kernel/crash.c".
[3/5] ipi_use_safe_smp_processor_idfault: replace smp_processor_id with
safe_smp_processor_id in "include/asm-i386/mach-*/mach_ipi.h".
I tried to incorporate all the ideas received after a previous post. In
particular I hope the new code is handling the Voyager case properly.
I am looking forward to your comments and suggestions.
Regards,
Fernando
