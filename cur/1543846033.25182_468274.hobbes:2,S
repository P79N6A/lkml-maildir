it could be cleanly handled though: in June i suggested to use the 
next-stack pointers at the end of exception pages. The only current 
complexity here is that the 'linking' of exception pages is non-uniform, 
it depends on the type of page. That's largely why that complex 
statemachine had to be implemented, to match up the type of the page. 
Since those pointers are put there by us, there's no real reason why we 
couldnt standardize them.
