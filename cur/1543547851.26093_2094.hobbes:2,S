Don't worry about that. I can add a rule to devfsd so it creates
appropriate compatibility entries.

Well, how about another directory name? Can you think of something
else that would be appropriate? And no, "LVM" is not on!
But we really should stop namespace pollution in /dev, and doing it
before 2.4 is released is the best time. In fact, given that this
patch has only gone in recently, I'd be inclined to go with the names
I suggested and just break the userspace tools. People have to expect
that things may change before a production kernel is released.
