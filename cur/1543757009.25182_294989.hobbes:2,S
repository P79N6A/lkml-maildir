Don't get me wrong, I would go nuts without swsusp2 on my notebook and I don't 
see why that shouldn't be a valid avenue to pursue; even for servers it doesn't 
seem like a terribly bad idea. But for me it only works on 1 out of my 4 
machines. The 3 non-working machines have their root and swap on SCSI devices 
and to top it off 2 of them are non-x86 architectures.
Another issue would be dual-booting, which a lot of people still do for some 
strange reason. At least I had noticed that Windows tends to have problems when 
filesystems it had mounted before the hibernation are altered while it's not 
running. I'm not sure if similar issues would apply to Linux, hell I'm not even 
sure if it still applies to Windows because that was so long ago that I had 
noticed.
