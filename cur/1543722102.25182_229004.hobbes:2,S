I can't compile 2.6.7-mm1. here are the errors :
CC      security/selinux/hooks.o
security/selinux/hooks.c:4129: error: `selinux_netlink_send' undeclared here (not in a function)
security/selinux/hooks.c:4129: error: initializer element is not constant
security/selinux/hooks.c:4129: error: (near initialization for `selinux_ops.netlink_send')
security/selinux/hooks.c:4130: error: `selinux_netlink_recv' undeclared here (not in a function)
security/selinux/hooks.c:4130: error: initializer element is not constant
security/selinux/hooks.c:4130: error: (near initialization for `selinux_ops.netlink_recv')
make[2]: *** [security/selinux/hooks.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [security/selinux] Error 2
make: *** [security] Error 2
With the same config, the 2.6.7 compiles perfectly. I join my .config.
