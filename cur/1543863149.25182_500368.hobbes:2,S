Completely agree. If you have barriers enabled in your filesystem, then
it should Just Work when you do fsync(). At least that is the case for
reiserfs and XFS, I'm not completely sure that ext3 also handles it
correctly.
For direct block device access, fsync() does need to provide a commit to
stable storage as well though.

That would be the preferable approach, just have the hardware that
doesn't need a flush ignore the FLUSH_CACHE. That would also need to
ignore the FUA bit on writes then. I'm not sure what the spec has to say
on this, basically the requirement is just that data is on stable
storage (eg survives power failure and so on), then that would be fine.
And I would hope it is, it'd be hard to specify anything else.

That only works if you just care about the stream of writes going to
stable storage and don't care about ordering. But the above is
essentially how the barriers work on write back cache + non queued
devices. When the barrier write is received, we commit the previous
writes first with a flush and then write the barrier (followed by
another flush, or possibly not if we have FUA).
