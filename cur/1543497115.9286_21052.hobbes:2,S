I'm attempting to upgrade a remote boot machine (etherboot 4.0
bootrom) from 2.0.34 to 2.2.5.  I am using dhcpd to provide boot info
including "option root-path".  The 2.0.34 kernel sends a bootp request,
gets a bootp answer, and gets a file handle for the directory specified in
the root-path option.  With the same dhcpd configuration fails to get the
directory specified in root-path.  
The kernel command line options are "auto rw root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=kernel
nfsaddrs=kernel".
Are there any changes that would effect this?  And if so do you have any
suggestions how to fix it?  Have the kernel options just changed?
Thanks so much for your help,
Ken
