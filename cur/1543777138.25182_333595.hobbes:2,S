Sigh. I guess some options in my .indent.pro overrode those in
scripts/Lindent. I just assumed it would do its job.
At any rate, the goal really is only to change the indentation to the
Linux standard, so I'll post a pre-patch to fix up a case where indent
misreads the code and indents a tab stop, as well as the one liner to
reformat.
