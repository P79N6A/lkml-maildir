Results from list-based have been posted. The actual patches will be

In an ideal world, we would have both. Zone-based would give guarantees on
the availability of reclaimed pages and list-based would give best-effort
everywhere.

It requires careful tuning. For suddenly different workloads, things may
go wrong. As with everything else, testing is required from workloads
defined by multiple people.

The obvious concern is that it is very easy to grow ZONE_NORMAL or
ZONE_HIGHMEM into the ZONE_EASYRCLM zone but it is hard to do the opposite
because you must be able to reclaim the pages at the end of the "awkward"
zone.
Linus has also stated that he does not mind the zone the kernel is using
(be it normal or highmem) growing, but he takes a dim view to it being
shrunk again. Either way, to shrink it again, it is likely that a page
migration mechanism is a requirement because there is no way to be sure
that easily reclaimed are at the end of the zone.
