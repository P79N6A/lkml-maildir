Note that main reason why sysfs uses ramfs model is that it gets good
interaction with VFS locking for free - it just uses ->i_sem of associated
inodes for tree protection and that gives us all we need.  Very nice,
but it means that we need these associated inodes.  And since operations
are done deep in tree, we don't want to walk all the way from root, bringing
them in-core.
However, having them for all nodes is an overkill - if we keep them only
for non-leaves, we get all the benefits of ramfs approach with less overhead.
Indeed, even if argument of sysfs operation is a leaf node (and I'm not sure
that we actually have such beasts), we can always take the parent node and
be done with that.
All we need is
	a) ->lookup() that would look for an attribute (all directories are
in cache, so if there's no attribute with such name and ->lookup() had been
called, we'd need to return negative anyway).
	b) sysfs code slightly modified in several places - mostly,
sysfs_get_dentry() callers.
