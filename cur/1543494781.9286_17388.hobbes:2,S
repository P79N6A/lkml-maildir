Ah ok. But that's the way I expect it to work. In the unlikely case you
want to disable the irq from the irq itself simply use
disable_irq_nosync(). If you instead call such my new API from a normal
context you are assured that after it there won't be an irqhandler running
on the same CPU that run previously disable_irq_nosync().
But in general it make not a lot of sense to disable an irq from the irq
itself, because if you are the irq your are just assured by design that
you can't reenter in yourself.
