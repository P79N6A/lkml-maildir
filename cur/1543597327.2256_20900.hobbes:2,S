If it changes vmlinux by a single byte, I might agree.... all it does
is close off and older depricated API.
Anyhow, say we leave linux/malloc.h for external module authors, but
make the other changes?
I'll re-run the script I wrote duing 2.5.x when we do remove malloc.h
to catch anything left over.
Does that sound reasonable?
