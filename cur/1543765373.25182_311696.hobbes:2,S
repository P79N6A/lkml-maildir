Nope. No go. The kernel log getsb these 4 lines:
Apr 13 22:08:30 tippex SCSI error : <0 0 0 0> return code = 0x8000002
Apr 13 22:08:30 tippex sr0: Current: sense key: Medium Error
Apr 13 22:08:36 tippex SCSI error : <0 0 0 0> return code = 0x8000002
Apr 13 22:08:36 tippex sr0: Current: sense key: Medium Error
and the application bails out with:
:-[ WRITE@LBA=0h failed with SK=5h/ASC=30h/ACQ=05h]: Wrong medium type
:-( media is not formatted or unsupported.
:-( write failed: Wrong medium type
This is with a fresh from the box DVD-RW. Do I need to 'format' the
thing before writing to it? This is getting tricky... Are these kind
of errors normally indicative of lack of support or a faulty unit?
I have no windows around to test it with the shipped nero-cd :-(
