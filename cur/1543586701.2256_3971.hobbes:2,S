I give you a concrete example:
Running DB2 on an SMP system.
In DB2 there is a processes/thread pool that is sized based
on memory and numcpus. People tell me that the size of this pool
is in the order of 100s for an 8-way system with reasonable
sized database. These <maxagents> determine the number of agents
that can simultaneously execute an SQL statement.
Requests are flying in for transactions (e.g. driven by TPC-W like
applications). The agents are grepped from the pool and concurrently
fire the SQL transactions.
Assuming that there is enough concurrency in the database, there is
no reason to believe that the majority of those active agents is
not effectively running. TPC-W loads have observed 100 of active
transactions at a time.
Ofcourse limiting the number of agents would reduce concurrently
running tasks, but would limit the responsiveness of the system.
Implementing a database in the kernel ala TUX doesn't seem to be
the right approach either (complexity, fault containment, ...)
Hope that is one example people accept.
I can dig up some information on WebSphere Applications.
I'd love to hear from some other applications that fall into
a similar category as the above and substantiate a bit the need
for 100s of running processes, without claiming that the
application is broke.

do you have some example of this in mind?  so far, noone has
actually produced an example of a "high end" server that has
long runqueues.
