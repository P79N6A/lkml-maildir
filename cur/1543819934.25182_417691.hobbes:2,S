Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Release Digsig 1.5: kernel module for run-time authentication of binaries
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Digsig development team would like to announce the release 1.5 of digsig.
This kernel module helps system administrators control Executable and 
Linkable Format (ELF) binary execution and library loading based on
the presence of a valid digital signature.  The main functionality is
to help system administrators distinguish applications he/she trusts
(and therefore signs) from viruses, worms (and other nuisances). It is
based on the Linux Security Module hooks.
The code is GPL and available from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/disec/,
 download digsig-1.5. For
more documentation, please refer to disec.sourcefrge.net.
We hope that it'll be useful to you.
All bug reports and feature requests or general feedback are welcome
(please CC me and disec-devel@lists.sourceforge.net in your answer or 
feedback to the mailing list).
Regards,
Makan Pourzandi
