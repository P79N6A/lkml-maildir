I was speaking about oprofile needs, that may interfere with target process 
needs, since oprofile calls find_vma() on the target process mm and thus zap 
its mmap_cache.
oprofile is yet another mmap_sem user, but also a mmap_cache destroyer.
We could at least have a separate cache, only for oprofile.
If done correctly we might avoid taking mmap_sem when the same vm_area_struct 
contains EIP/RIP snapshots.
