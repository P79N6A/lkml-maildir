I think that the main question here is -- what exact features are you 
missing in the vanilla Linux kernel that grsecurity provides?
Over past months/years, vanilla kernel gained some of the features that 
were initially present only in the PaX/grsecurity patchsets (address space 
layout randomization for x86, to name the one that I have been involved 
in myself).
Other things (roles? && access control stuff ) could be achieved by code 
that is already present in the vanilla kernel (selinux, smack and 
friends).
