Sigh...  Configurations with /usr/include/{linux,asm} being symlinks
are BROKEN.  Please, look through the archives - it had been discussed
a lot of times.  Userland has no business using kernel headers directly
and that's precisely what had bitten you - setup where /usr/include/asm
comes not from libc but from the (currently being built) kernel.
