I haven't tried it yet, but I'm interested in your result, since my
2.5.41-mm2v result was actually better then plain -mm2. I am just building
some new test stuff on an SMP machine so I can compare uni and SMP
performance under load, and I'll look at 2.5.42 tonight or tomorrow.
My reference machine was a 96MB machine, if you're really curious about
this you could boot with mem=96m (or 128m) and rerun the test. In any case
I have the kids tonight, if I get some time I'll try it, otherwise
tomorrow.
