Best?  No.
Local APIC timers are based on a clock which on many processors will
STOP when the processor enters power saving idle states, such as C3.
So the LAPIC timer will not accurately reflect how much time
has passed across entry/exit from idle.
True, this has not been an issue on SMP, since there have not been
SMP systems shipping with C3, but as you know soon everything
interesting will be SMP...
