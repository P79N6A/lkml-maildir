Interesting... _If_ that happens - we have a bug somewhere that gives us a
slow block leak.
Look: if *prealloc_count is non-zero - we have several blocks (from
*prealloc_block to *prealloc_block+*prealloc_count-1) marked as busy in
the bitmap, but not attached to inode (yet). The next lines destroy all
information about them - here's an instant leak for you. Normally
ext2_discard_prealloc() would take care about freeing them, but it is not
going to find them...
_If_ that assertion is triggered - too bad, it means that we just didn't
notice that leak until now.
