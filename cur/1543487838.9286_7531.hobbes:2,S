The Linux networking traces I've seen with MTU discovery all show it working
correctly and faults at remote sites. I have yet to see a single case where
the problem is the Linux end with 2.0.x
With 2.2.x it is entirely possible given the changes to the masquerading
code that a bug has crept in. But I've yet to see a trace for that and it
would be suprising
(If you think about it masquerading doesnt kick in on a download problem 
 error case. The errored tcp frame bounces off the start of the low MTU
 PPP link before it is masqueraded)
