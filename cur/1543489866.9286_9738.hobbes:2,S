I don't think forking's much of an issue either. But being able to keep
track of which patches you're using (especially if someone gives you a
precompiled kernel) is useful. Together with the config.gz thing, this
will let you report most of the relevant info about a running kernel
(config options, compiler, applied patches) with a simple script.
And simply being able to build 2.2.x and 2.2.x+foo on the same machine
without having them overwrite each other's modules should be worth it by
itself for developers.
