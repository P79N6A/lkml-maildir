Nope.  pgpgout is simply writes to disk, of all types.
swapout is accounted for under pswpout and your vmstat trace shows a little
bit of (healthy) swapout with swappiness=100 and negligible swapout with
swappiness=0.  In both cases, negligible swapin.  That's all just fine.

Look at your "si" column in vmstat.  It's practically all zeroes.

swappiness=100: swaps a lot.  swappiness=0: doesn't swap much.
With a funny workload like that you might choose to set swappiness to 0
just around the hourly tar operation, but as the machine seems to not be
swapping there doesn't seem to be a need.
