Hmm, the only multiport cards I've used are
some tlans and some intel pro 100s -
The tlans are no good for serious use, at least
in my experience - I've been replacing them
as replacements are available.
The dual intel 10/100s I've used work fine,
they are simply detected as 2 intel ethernet
devices.
