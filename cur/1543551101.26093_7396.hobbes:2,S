Then spam the console loudly with printk, but don't destroy the whole machine.
Init should only get killed if it REALLY is taking a lot of memory.  On a 4 or 8meg
machine tho, the probability of init getting killed is simply too high for
comfort.  I have never ever seen init start consuming memory like this so I'd
rather get spammed on the console a LOT then have my entire machine instantly go
dead.
We get enough reports about innocuous messages on the console, I'm sure these would
get reported to LKML as well...and in short order as is usual.
