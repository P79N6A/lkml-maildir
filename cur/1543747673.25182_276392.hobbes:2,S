The issue is that the SiI 311x controllers send out packets (called 
"FIS's" in SATA-land) that are not multiples of 512 bytes.
This is perfectly legal according to SATA spec, but early drive 
firmwares (notoriously Seagate in this case) were written with the 
assumption that the FIS's would be multiples of 512 bytes.
