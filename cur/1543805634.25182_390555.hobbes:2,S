That's an interesting idea...  Keep track of the number of pages "reserved"
but allow them to be used something like read-only pagecache...  Something
along those lines would most certainly be easier on the page allocator,
since it wouldn't have chunks of pages "missing" for long periods of time.

The impetus for this work was getting this functionality into the
networking stack, to keep the network alive under periods of extreme VM
pressure.  Keeping track of 'criticalness' on a per-socket basis is good,
but the problem is the receive side.  Networking packets are received and
put into skbuffs before there is any concept of what socket they belong to.
 So to really handle incoming traffic under extreme memory pressure would
require something beyond just a per-socket flag.
I have to say I'm somewhat amused by how much support the old approach is
getting now that I've spent a few weeks going back to the drawing board and
coming up with what I thought was a more general solution! :\
