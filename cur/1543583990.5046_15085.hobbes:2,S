I think one of the maintainers for usb-uhci (Georg) said he'd
want the general fix ...

There are two problems I see.
(1) CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG breaks the documented
requirement that the slab cache return adequately aligned
data ... which the appended patch should probably handle
nicely (something like it sure did :-) and with less danger
than the large patch you posted.
(2) The USB host controller drivers all need something
like a pci_consistent slab cache, which doesn't currently
exist.  I have something like that in the works, and David
Miller noted one driver that I may steal from.
