	There is no difference. Every requirement can be rephrased as an equivalent
restriction. The requirement that you maintain the terms is the same as a
restriction against removing them.

	Definitely.

	Then you have another problem. You can't place something under the GPL if
you don't have the source code to it. How can you offer the source code to
others if you don't have it? (Though my opinion seems to differ from the
mainstream on this point. It is my opinion that you must possess the source
code to any object code you wish to GPL.)

	Glad to hear that.

	Of course, you shouldn't rely upon them.
