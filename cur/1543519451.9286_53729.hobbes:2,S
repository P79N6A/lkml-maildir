  No problem :)  No offence taken...

   That's what I figured.  I bet this is the reason for the lost
interrupts then.  The driver has to have a full implementation of all the
modem protocols in software and could definitely hold the system up.  This
isn't to say that their driver couldn't be improved, but as you said, I have
to take this up with them.  However this could start to come up more often as
we see more of these in use on Linux in the future.  We can't be responsible
for other peoples' proprietary drivers, but it might be worthwhile to either
try to detect bad drivers in some sense, or at least document the cause of
the problem.
