OK, that patch was misdescribed.  It in fact added the <asm/hardirq.h>
includes to arch/avr32/kernel/traps.c and arch/sh/kernel/traps_32.c.
The "sparc fix" was Sam's patch:

yes, there were some nasty problems liek that.  In several cases we wimped
out and added the necessary includes to the .c file.  Will that (sad hack)
work here?
