OK.  So until that CPU sees it bit come on in smp_commenced_mask()
it's not allowed to assume that it is running yet.

I agree.  And from a quick read it does seem that ia32 is
doing the right thing apart from calling printk.
I don't think we should make changes to the timer code because
who knows what assumptions other console drivers could be making?
I don't think we should carefully remove all printk() calls because
printk() is supposed to be robust, and always callable.
The logical thing is to implement arch_consoles_callable().  Does
this look workable?
