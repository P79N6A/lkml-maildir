Oh, come on. (a) is obvious, but obviously not enough ;-)

Yes, but block reservation also makes sense (otherwise we can end up
putting a directory into parent's CG only to have all children
going there _and_ getting far from their data).  Which might be the
problem with original code, BTW.
OK, anyway - I've got a bunch of cleanups for ialloc.c (equivalent
transformations, split into small steps and decently tested - I've
used them for almost a year).  That stuff moves choice of CG for
directories and non-directories into separate functions, so no
matter which variant we end up doing I think that it's worth doing
first - things will be cleaner after that.
