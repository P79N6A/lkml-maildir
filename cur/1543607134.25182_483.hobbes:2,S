My logic is that a lack of rebellion implies consent.  If you don't
rebel against it, then you must agree with it.  If you don't agree with it,
then you must rebel against it.  Is there a flaw in that logic?  Surely,
there are degrees to it, i.e., you disagree, but not enough to be
killed.  However, in what is practically the scenario now (either
they're are killed by the Taliban for disagreeing or killed by Americans
for agreeing), it only makes sense to align yourself with the same side
as your heart.
