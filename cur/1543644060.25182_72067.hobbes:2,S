I agree.  But the info is now in the driver core, it's not present in
the USB core at all anymore.  So since drverfs exports what's in the
driver core, that info shows up there.  usbfs doesn't have access to
this info, so it can't display it.

Is this file _really_ used?  All it did was show the USB drivers
registered.  Even so, that same information is now present in driverfs,
I haven't taken away anything, just moved it.  Lots of things are
starting to move to driverfs, this isn't the first, and will not be the
last.
