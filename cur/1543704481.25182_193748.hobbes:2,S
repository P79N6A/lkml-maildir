I have some faint recollections of when I was using USB mass storage 
camera media.  Look into a package called scsiadd; which can be used to 
rescan the bus and add/remove devices on the fly.

 is what google brings me up.
I think this will help you - you'll need to rescan the USB mass-storage 
bus - remove/add devices when you change the parameters of a device. 
It's quite easy, I cobbled together a little shell script that would 
remove add the device then mount it.  I used that script to mount the 
USB card instead of mount - meant that I was sure the scsiadd stuff was 
handled if needed.
I think this will help you work around having to reboot.
rgds,
Phil
