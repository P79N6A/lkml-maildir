Did you expect anything less :-)
As soon as I trace and squash an introduced bug in the delayed SATA 1.0
release for 2.4, I will do an update of the original port forward.
Also you will enjoy the added features of 2.4 soon.
echo ide-scsi:{0|1} > /proc/ide/hdX/settings
This will auto sense and discretely toggle the atapi/ide-scsi driver sets
between devices with all modules built-in.  This is a minor detail but it
is the next to last stage of dynamic devices sense on open("/dev/hdX").
