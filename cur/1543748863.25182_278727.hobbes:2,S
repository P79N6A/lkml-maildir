Drive is obviously degrading, I tried it "one more time" today with 2.4, and 
it only just managed to work.  It managed to finish the task, but there were 
several resets and error messages very similar to the ones in 2.6.
My apologies to others time that I might have wasted, although it personally 
was a good learning experience on how the kernel works.
