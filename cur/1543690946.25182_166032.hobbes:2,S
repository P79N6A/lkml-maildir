Subject: [SUMMARY] rebooting problem solved - athlon/SiS incompatibility.

Hi,
As a follow up to a message that I sent earlier, I've found
the reason that my machine would reboot on 2.6 kernels.  It
could be argued that it's no fault of the kernel, but perhaps
the documentation should be updated.
I traced the problem to between the gunzip() call and the
startup32 call.  There are very few options that affect this,
obviously.  Two that do are CONFIG_SMP and the coprocessor
emulation option.  After turning them off and rebuilding,
the kernel started.  It hung on ACPI, but after compiling that
out of the kernel, it booted fine and I'm running it now.
This is the output of lspci, to show the configuration that will
cause this problem:

Which basically seems to mean:  you cannot enable SMP and turn off coprocessor
emulation on an SiS motherboard containing an Athlon Thunderbird processor.  The
kernel will not even get past the "Ok, booting the kernel" stage.
