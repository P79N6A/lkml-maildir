According to debian's package description for the irq balance package:
"Daemon to balance irq's across multiple CPUs on systems with the 2.4 or
2.6 kernel. This can lead to better performance and IO balance on SMP
systems. Useful mostly just for 2.4 kernels, or 2.6 kernels with
CONFIG_IRQBALANCE turned off."
I have the CONFIG_IRQBALANCE option turned on, so it should be balancing
the irq's itself; is it not?  Would there even be any benefit from
balancing the irq's with a single dual core processor?  Thanks.
Adrian
