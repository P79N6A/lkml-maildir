It'll not crash the machine for the swapped out case, but it is unsafe 
(e.g. when someone calls munmap for the brk region inbetween or when the
page can not be swapped in)

It'll cause a kernel oops when the address is not mapped.
You need the special exception handlers the *_user functions set up
to catch it.
Also accessing the user space directly this way is not portable (e.g.
it won't work on the m68k or sparc port, it only works by accident in the
current x86 port because the user space is 1:1 mapped)
The rule is simple: for all user space accesses use *_user(). I don't know
why you don't want it.
