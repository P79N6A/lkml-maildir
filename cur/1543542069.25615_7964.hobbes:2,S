That's one aspect.
Another is finding out *how* to do that sharing right.
When your code is riddled with #ifdefs, most people will agree that  
something's wrong here.
However, when all those #ifdefs get converted to if()s, something's  
*still* wrong here. It's just wrong at runtime instead of wrong at compile  
time.
The point here is that when something like that happens, one needs to sit  
back and think about abstractions. A new, better abstraction is usually  
what is needed in this situation - something that makes most of those  
conditionals go away, *stay* away, and possible also take care of a number  
of forseeable future ones.
Unfortunately, sometimes the best new abstraction one can come up with is  
a driver split. In that case, can we have common subroutines/macros/ 
definitions at least? Or maybe change macros and leave the rest the same?  
Those are also ways to abstract change.
Maybe we can't, or at least we don't know how. Too bad.
Then again, maybe we *can* find ways to handle this without giving up on  
common source, and without producing code riddled with conditionals.  
*That* is the ideal case.
