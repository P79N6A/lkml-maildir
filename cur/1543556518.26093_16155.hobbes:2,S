It is also called during prune_icache().  Yes, I know that the
CAN_UNUSE() macro should make sure we never try to do this on a
count==0 inode which still has dirty buffers, but I'd feel happier if
we had the safety net to guard against any callers ever doing a
clear_inode while we have dirty buffers around.
We have two completely different paths to clear_inode() here: one in
which there had better not be any dirty buffers or we've got a data
corrupter on our hands, and a second in which dirty buffers are
irrelevant because we're doing a delete.
That's the problem --- doing the invalidate in clear_inode() feels
like the wrong place to do it, because our treatment of the dirty
buffers list differs depending on the caller.  I'd be much happer with
the delete case doing the invalidate, and leave clear_inode BUG()ing
if there are any dirty buffers left, and that's basically what the
test with i_nlink==0 did.

No, I don't think so.
Cheers,
