Yes, this interaction between CONFIG_MODVERSIONS and CONFIG_SMP is a
nasty bug in CONFIG_MODVERSIONS (it does not remake the .ver files when
the configuration changes).
I am working on a new CONFIG_MODVERSIONS but I don't know if I'll have
it ready for 2.4.  Sigh.  For the curious, it uses "objcopy --redefine-sym"
to fix up symbol names, with no .ver files anywhere.
