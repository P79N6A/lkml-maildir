Subject: Is sys_sysfs used?

In fs/filesystems.c, we have sys_sysfs: 
/*
 * Whee.. Weird sysv syscall. 
 */
asmlinkage long sys_sysfs(int option, unsigned long arg1, unsigned long arg2)
{
	...
}
Which is, as advertised, kinda weird. 
I see that only one architecture defines __NR_sysfs: x86-64, though it
appears most architectures mention it in arch/*/kernel/entry.S (or 
equivalent). 
Is it used anymore? Would it be possible to remove it?
