You know, I have been running into that exact same problem, except that
I don't fork at all.  I start up my process and nearly immediately try
and spawn a few threads.  The calling thread blocks indefinately in
a __sigsuspend(), but is apparently delivered an unknown signal.
The spawned thread executes normally.
It appears to be fixed when I compile with -D_REENTRANT, but I am not
certain...
