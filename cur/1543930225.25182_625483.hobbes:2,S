Hi,
In this patch, I unify segment_32.h and segment_64.h into segment.h
They have some common parts, but a considerable ammount of code still has
to be around ifdefs. 
The only patch that is really important to paravirt is the first one, that
moves a paravirt definition into the common header. The other two are just
normal integration, and pretty much independent
