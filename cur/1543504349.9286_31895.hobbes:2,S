Unless things have changed in the last few months, the current
implementation of pthreads combined w/ the clone implementation prevents
delivery of signals (w/ some special goodies for POSIX RT queued
signals) per the POSIX specs for signals and threads.
I am currently working on a design, and may in the future be pursuing a
project where it would be possible to conform to POSIX with regard to
signals and know which thread/process is within a given "thread group"
(to be viewed logically as a "multi-threaded process").
