Subject: [10/12] V4L: Fix VIDIOCGAP corruption in ivtv
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/29/504

2.6.24-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us
know.
------------------
From: Alan Cox <alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk>
Frank Bennett reported that ivtv was causing skype to crash. With help
from one of their developers he showed it was a kernel problem.
VIDIOCGCAP copies a name into a fixed length buffer - ivtv uses names
that are too long and does not truncate them so corrupts a few bytes of
the app data area.
Possibly the names also want trimming but for now this should fix the
corruption case.
