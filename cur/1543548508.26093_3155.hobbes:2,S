I've been hammering this all day installing the relevent tools and
building win32 mozilla under vmware (the drives being 2Gb files on a
reiserfs partition).  This partition also doubles as /home.
Very stable so far, and having Andrea's VM patches in (I usually didn't
put them in) has made a noticeable difference - xmms has rarely skipped
and things start faster and run smoother.  Hopefully I'll see the same
(or better) results from Rik's new VM in 2.4 when that's released.

FWIW the reiserfs partition is on a 30Gb IBM 75GXP attached to a Promise
ATA100 PCI controller.  I have Andre's 20000904 ide patch in.  Nice
drive if you have to use IDE, and I have no complaints about the
controller either.
