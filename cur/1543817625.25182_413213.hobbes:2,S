That's doesn't seem to be the point that Tony was making.  To illustrate
it let's add a practical example:
static inline void clear_bit_mode(int bit, unsigned long *ptr, int mode)
{
	case (mode) {
	...
	}
}
void foo(blah blah, int mode)
{
	... complex function ...
	clear_bit_mode(bit, ptr, mode);
	...
}
void bar(blah blah)
{
	foo(blah, MODE_BARRIER);
}
In this case, the compiler can not optimise the unnecessary code from
the clear_bit_mode because the mode argument quite definitely is not a
constant known at compile time.  Only if 'foo' was a static inline
would it be known.
