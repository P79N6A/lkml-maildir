It's just weird - it exploits internal knowledge of VFS behaviour, diddles
with pagecache within a fake disk strategy handler, etc.
Furthermore, because it pretends to be a block device, the VFS will not use
highmem pages when accessing the ramdisk.  So the 8GB machine will go splat
with only 800MB of ramdisk.
ramfs is much cleaner and does not have that limitation.

loopback does some pretty weird thigns too, but it has more of an excuse:
it is a specialised layering thing, whereas ramdisk is, umm, just a
ramdisk.

Store it all in ramfs, no loopback needed?
