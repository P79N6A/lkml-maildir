Ok, I installed xlibmesa-gl1-dri-trunk, xserver-xfree86-dri-trunk and
compiled linux-2.6.11-rc4 and drm modules from drm-trunk-module-src, all
from 
http://www.nixnuts.net/files/
But I had no success whatsoever. With this (Xorg server, current dri/drm
stuff, ..) the laptop not even wakes up from sleep!
Now I am back at debian XFree 4.3.0.1 and DRI disabled and suspend works
again.
I don't know wether this is a problem with the kernel or the drm, so to
sum up:
- kernel 2.6.11-rc3-mm2, XFree 4.3.0.1 (debian/sid), no dri
	works
- kernel 2.6.11-rc4, Xorg 6.8.1.99 (debian sid + nixnuts), drm cvs, drm 
  activated
	no resume (thus also no test for X)
Best wishes
Norbert
