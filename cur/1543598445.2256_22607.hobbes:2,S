a strace shows it works differently
nanosleep({1, 0}, {1, 0})               = 0
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFREG|0600, st_size=227128, ...}) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [CHLD], [RT_0], 8) = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGCHLD, NULL, {SIG_DFL}, 8) = 0
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [RT_0], NULL, 8) = 0
the file is opened just once (as I expected), and tail sleeps in nanosleep
() until the file grows. I think strace isn't showing more nanosleep() as it
should be looping there. BTW what's the reason for the sigprocmask, etc?
