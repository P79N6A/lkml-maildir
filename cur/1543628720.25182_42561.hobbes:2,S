Have you tried without running X ?
A SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR task has ALWAYS priority over any SCHED_OTHER
task, so if your application sits in an infinite loop without blocking, the 
window manager cannot preempt it and you simply cannot switch x-term.
I think you should carefully debug your app in SCHED_OTHER mode first, and 
then switch to some real-time policy.

It would be surprising, but if you were sure of that, it would deserve some 
deeper investigations !
