Yes, I agree and, like I said, there are other things to do still. It just
looked like "the field was added recently but no support for it so it may
be a 'must-have' item for 2.4.0" which is why I rushed to try and give it
some meaning.
At least one useful thing came out of this exercise -- I understand the fd
allocation (fs/file.c) routines now.
