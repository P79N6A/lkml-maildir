Replying to myself with an update.  After reading the fs/Kconfig help
for SMB_FS I now realize that having that compiled in or not was 
orthogonal to starting the samba server.
I installed Redhat 9 (Shrike) on the test box, and tested samba with
both the vendor kernel and 2.5.67 (with and without SMB_FS before I
realized that was not the issue).  It all worked.  Then I upgraded
the samba packages (security updates) and tested everything again, and
it still all works. 
I cannot reproduce the kernel BUG at fs/buffer.c:2538, at least not yet.
