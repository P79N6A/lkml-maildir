Why? Directories are directories, files are files, file contents is file
contents. Mixing them up is a bad idea. Sure, you could build a filesystem
of sorts (perhaps more in the vein of persistent programming, or even data
base systems) where there simply is no distinction (because there are no
differences to show), but that is something different.

I'd go one level up: Eliminate the distinctions that bother you, not try to
patch over them.
