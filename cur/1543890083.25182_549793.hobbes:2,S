git bisect told me that this is the first bad commit:

libata: add deadline support to prereset and reset methods
I suspected my unstable timing source and booted with acpi=off. Now
the printk timestamps are in sequence but the bug is still there.
The drive worked flawlessly with the old ide-cd. So what's the
difference between libata and ide-cd?
Is there a kernel parameter to completely disable probing the cdrom?
Thanks,
Gregor
