We don't need "low cost RNG" and "high cost RNG" in the same kernel. 
That just begs a "reduce RNG cost" solution...  I think security experts 
can easily come up with arguments as to why creating your own "low-cost 
crappy PRNG" isn't needed -- you either need crypto-secure, or you 
don't.  If you don't, then you could just as easily create an ascending 
64-bit number for your opaque filehandle, or use a hash value, or some 
other solution that doesn't require an additional PRNG in the kernel.
For VIA CPUs, life is easy.  Use xstore insn and "You've got bytes!"  :)
