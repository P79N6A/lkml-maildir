I'd say lets keep nice levels out of this completely for now - while 
they should work _too_, it's easy because the scheduler has the 'nice' 
information. The basic behavior of CPU hogs that matters most.
So the question is: if all tasks are on the same nice level, how does, 
in Mike's test scenario, RSDL behave relative to the current 
interactivity code?
