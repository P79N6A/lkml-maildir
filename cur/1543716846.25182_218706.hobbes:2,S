OK.. I need to clarify - I'm OK on the patch being *in -mm* precisely *because*
it's a testing ground.  Anybody who's running a -mm kernel should have the
technical savvy to deal with the issue by reverting the one patch in question,
and to recover if it eats their file system (Yes, I'm running 2.6.6-rc3-mm2 and
the NVidia driver as I type.  No, making it work wasn't a problem.  Yes, I spin
everything needed to rebuild out to CD/RW at least once a week, just because it
*is* a -mm kernel. ;)
It's a Good Idea to do this in -mm, to flush out all the binary modules that
are known to have issues with this (have we identified anybody other than NVidia
that actually *has* a problem)?
It's probably a Bad Idea to push this to Linus before the vendors that have
significant market-impact issues (again - anybody other than NVidia here?)
have gotten their stuff cleaned up...
