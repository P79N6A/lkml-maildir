I did it symmetrically for suspend and hibernation and renamed SUSPEND_SMP to
PM_SLEEP_SMP.  Patch follows.

Dependencies of CONFIG_SUSPEND and CONFIG_HIBERNATION introduced by commit
296699de6bdc717189a331ab6bbe90e05c94db06 "Introduce CONFIG_SUSPEND for
suspend-to-Ram and standby" are incorrect, as they don't cover the facts that
(1) not all architectures support suspend and (2) SMP hibernation is only
possible on X86 and PPC64 (if PPC64_SWSUSP is set).
