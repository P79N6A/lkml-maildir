Indeed, it registers a platform device. On the dynamic vs static
subject, it shouldn't matter here. Could switch to dynamic allocation
if needed.

No, it won't ever be a module. It woudn't make sense. Most of the time,
it is needed to boot the system...

The only case in which it is called is when registration to the EISA
framework fails (because there is no EISA mainboard, or some PCI/EISA
bridge has registered before, with the same IO range). Thus we call
plateform_device_unregister, which calls the release function. And
this only happens at init time. Never after.
Thanks,
