I've tried to explore this suggestion (the best I could).
There are 2 ext3 filesystems locally mounted. / and this one. Running 16 
parallel runs of this program on a file on the /-mounted filesystem 
cannot reproduce the problem. If it was linked to hot hardware, I 
believe I should be able to reproduce it this way. The servers are in a 
17 degress serverroom.
It changes alot when.. it actually happens. The "earliest ones" has been 
from 200000 cycles.
Ive tried to upgrade.. so the system is now running a 2.6.24-16-server 
(Ubuntu/Hardy) kernel. But execpt from differnet output in uname, 
everything else seems to be the same.
All suggestions/ideas are welcome? The general feeling is that it wont 
change a thing to reformat the filesystem?
