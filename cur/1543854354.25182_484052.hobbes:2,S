I've been working on this with Jay since his initial submission.  Thanks 
to everyone who has provided feedback on the resubmit.  We're currently 
quite short on actual testers, since the chip only seems to be on Asus 
M2V motherboards at present.  Please let me and Jay know if you have one 
of these boards and would like to test and/or have encountered bugs.
