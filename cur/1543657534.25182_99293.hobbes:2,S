Hi ,
I am writing a code in a driver for issuing persistent group reservation to
a SCSI disk.
For this I am using the functions scsi_allocate_request to create the
request packet and then calling scsi_wait_req (with command as
PERSISTENT_RESERVE_OUT and service action as Register) to transport the
command to the SCSI disk.
The problem I am facing is I am not able to send the parameter list
(consisting of Reservation key,Service action reservation key etc).with the
command.
The error message which I get is "Invalid field in parameter list" . I guess
this error came because the parameter list
was not supplied .
Can anybody suggest how to send the command and the parameter list together
i.e. whether the command parameter of scsi_wait_req will have both the
command and parameter list together ?
Thanks and Regards
Chandrasekhar
