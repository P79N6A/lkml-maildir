Heck no, it won't.  I had `put_file(file, 1);' in nlmsvc_traverse_shares()
before, and it complained.
Have you looked at put_file() close enough?  It's an inline function,
and it's basically `--f_count' plus my paranoia.  Again, feel free to
remove it and simply decrement f_count if you like that better.  Or put
all f_count manipulations into a pair of new functions.  But please
stop arguing with me -- I only found the bug, fixed it, reported it,
and now I will say good-bye and move on.  I guess Linus & others are
already becoming bored... sorry for that.

Yes, but the call to nlm_release_file() on return from nlmsvc_proc_*()
will decrement it again.  In lockd's main event loop, no changes are
visible unless you add or remove a share.

Who is "we"?
Excuse me, but lockd is so full of `maintenance issues' (*cough*) that I
would never have touched it if there hadn't been this bug.  Maybe that's
the reason why the bug has been there for such a long time and nobody
cared to fix it, although there has been at least one report 5 months ago.
Did I hear `thank you'?
