Christoph,
You can try to hide the forest by killing some trees.
Are you sure that RCU 'file structs' is the only problem lying around ?
For instance, I think other RCU freeing problem are dormant (see maxbatch=10 
and think about the number of routes a busy router (or DOS attack) can handle...
Of course, a 'test program' is more difficult to write than a
while (1) close(open("/dev/null", 3));
