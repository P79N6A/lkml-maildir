I've actually looked at the code now and it seems that it might be
quite easy to fix this, after all.
I have a question about cdrom_start_read_continuation:
Variables called nframes and frames are computed but never used. Only
nskip actually gets factored into the request:
	rq->current_nr_sectors += nskip;
The others are local vars and never get assigned to anything more
global. So I conclude they are meaningless? I ask because this
is one of the places that uses SECTORS_PER_FRAME and it doesn't make
sense to me.
Unrelated question:
Later on, the code decides to use DMA only for requests aligned
on a SECTORS_PER_FRAME boundary. Where does this limitation come from?
Does it come from the drive, so that alignment to 512 byte would be
enough on a drive with 512 byte sectors?
I've actually ordered some 512 byte sector MO discs today and will try
to get them working with ide-cd once they arrive here.
