what are those bugs?
the sysdata stuff try to fix:
when calgary iommu code was introduced, it is trying to share sysdata
that orginally is initialized k8_bus.c and used by pcibus_to_node. but
that only happen with AMD K8 platform. and have nothing to do with
calgary.
Then my patch get_mp_bus_to_node_as_early will use that sysdata as
node as early as possible before the pci_scan bus is called.
then Mul came out his patch ...to split the sharing that will never happen.
But andi picked muli patch even my patch stay a while in -mm.
Also i don't think anyone test muli sysdata patch with amd64 platform
with acpi=off. even muli himself.
calgary support bus numa at this time? i mean mult peer root bus on
different node..
anyway I will produce my patch in v3...
