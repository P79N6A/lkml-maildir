I don't think it is necessary to split kprobe_exception_notify(). All it is 
having is a simple switch case and based on the swich case it takes appropriate
actions.

Their is no race while we call unregister_page_fault_notifier(), as we unregister
only after the last probe is removed and after synchronized_sched() is done which
guarantees that all the probes have completly finished executing.

Calling kprobe_exception_notify() directly can be made to work with
out any races if needed. Not sure if calling directly  will have 
any significant performance improvement over current non-overloaded
call chain notifications.
