Anyone know what is needed to use the special buttons on a keyboard that has
extra buttons for internet / favorite apps / cd player controls etc...
I bought a keyboard that appears to be one of these things: (both urls are for
the same part)

+Options%7CInput+Devices%7CKeyboards%7C00K8649

Neither showkey, nor showkey -s, show anything when pressing the extra buttons.
sad side note: IBM didn't even make an OS/2 driver for an IBM oem part.
