The company argument really doesn't bother me at all ;-)
I'm much more concerned with making things easy to maintain ... the .h
file stuff under subarch is *superb* as long as you don't have to build
one kernel that supports many machines. If the .c stuff worked like that,
I'd have no issues.
The function vector stuff is another issue ... we need to make the distros
happy at some point soon for the mainline arches that need to be supported
at least (ie NUMA-Q et al don't matter so much).
