It's been asserted that the patent licence requires that _all_ userspace 
apps running on the system by GPL'd. Yet there are many Free Software 
applications in a standard Linux distribution that are under 
GPL-incompatible licences. Apache, xinetd, etc...
If that interpretation is true, it _would_ be a problem, and not just for 
those trying to make money from it.
