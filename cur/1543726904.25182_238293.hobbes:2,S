Nope. I don't think it makes sense to have the caller understand
anything about D states. And their actual impact on hardware tend
to depends from one chip to another too...

Nobody can get a D state right anyway, so it makes no sense to pass
that to drivers. Only the driver itself may know it's hardware well
enough (eventually with platform specific tweaks) to figure out what
D state to apply for a global policy.
What we need to pass to drivers are policies. Right now, we defined
suspend-to-ram and suspend-to-disk system wide policies, we may want
to define some additional ones especially those that can be triggered
by userspace to individual drivers.

Well, system suspend state too, right, it defines the driver
state we are asking for.

Sure, and that already works, but it's a per driver policy at this
point, I don't think we can do much better at the driver model level.

I don't understand what you are talking about... in the case of
usb-storage, it has scsi disk as it's child in the device tree,
the child should get the suspend call first of course, and yes, I know
the current sysfs semantics for userland-originated suspend are broken.
Right now, we are trying to at least get the full system suspend
working, we can work on fixing partial-tree suspend (which is what you
want there) later.

Yup, but I still consider that it's a non-sense to pass D states to
driver suspend() callback ;)
