Turns out that it is common.
It is in i386 defconfig, ships on i386 Fedora Core 6,  ships on i386 OpenSuse 10.2.
For x86_64 it isn't in defconfig or OpenSuse 10.2, but is in Fedora Core 6.
So I've taken Andi's advice and checked in the patches below.
(I didn't bother updating defconfig, it will generate according to this rule
and I don't want to conflict with any re-generation andi might be checking in)
thanks,

    ACPI: always enable CONFIG_PNPACPI on CONFIG_ACPI kernels
    We removed the ACPI motherboard driver which handled
    the ACPI=y, PNP=n case, so now we need to enforce that
    PNP & PNPACPI are always enabled for ACPI kernels.
    Most major distros ship this way this already.

    ACPI: remove non-PNPACPI version of get_rtc_dev()
    It isn't needed in ACPI code anymore because
    now ACPI always includes PNPACPI.
