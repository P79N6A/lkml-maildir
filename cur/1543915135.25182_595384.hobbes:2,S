The main thing keeping me from doing this ATM is what I perceive as lack 
of interest in a generic interface.  I think it's also a little 
premature given that we don't have any features on the plate yet.  
However, I don't think that means that we cannot turn KVM's PV into a 
generic one.  So here's what I propose.
Let's start building the KVM PV interface on 4000 0000.  That means that 
Xen cannot initially use it but that's okay.  Once KVM-lite is merged 
and we have some solid features (and other guests start implementing 
them), we can also advertise this interface as a "generic interface" by 
also supporting the signature on leave 4000 1000 and using the MSR 
trickery that you propose.
As long as we all agree not to use 4000 1000 for now, it leaves open the 
possibility of having a generic interface in the future.
