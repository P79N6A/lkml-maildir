Yes I know. I was just kidding ;-) I would say that I didn't know the
git bisection method at all... but I would say that it is really
smashing!

Okay, here is the point: I will have these bloody buffer underruns
unless I select a 'Timer frequency' of 1000 Hz in 'Processor type and
features' section of the kernel configuration. That's quite
understandable, as recording a DVD at 16x requires a throughput of 22160
KB/s, which is quite fast.
I will have a deep look in the patch, and maybe write a patched patch
(Ooooo my god what am I writing ?) in the next few days.

I do not get any kernel error message. It is just my burning app that
complains that buffer underruns occured, as if the source media was not
fast enough to deliver 22160 KB/s.
