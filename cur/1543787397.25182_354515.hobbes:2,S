I think this is a BIOS problem; the BIOS needs to provide the proper 
ACPI frequency/voltage tables for cpufreq to use. You might want to 
harass your system/motherboard vendor.
Alternately maybe you can find someone who can give you the secret table 
and then you can just hardcode it into the driver.

Beware that p4-clockmod won't increase the power efficiency of your 
system. (As an aside, clock modulation is so simple that you can do it 
from userspace in a few lines of C if you modprobe msr. This works on 
x86-64.)
