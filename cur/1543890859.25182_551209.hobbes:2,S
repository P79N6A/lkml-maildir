Yes, you're right, but I was just wondering whether any users really
cared enough about the rowsize and groupsize, also seeing that
accommodating these two args leads to a lot of increase in code.

Please, don't drop this! I only complained because when global or
commonly-used functions have very long arglists, one tends to forget
which arg goes at which number, and it becomes necessary to write
the calls with having the prototype simultaneously open in another
terminal for reference! ...

Oh yes, I'd missed that if (!len) goto nil; -- sorry for the noise.
