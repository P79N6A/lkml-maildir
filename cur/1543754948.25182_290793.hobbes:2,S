From within the kernel, on Intel machines, all addresses that are
mapped (using ioremap_nocache()) are addressable even if there is
no hardware at that address. It cannot cause a system panic. A
read from non-existent hardware will simply return a value with
all bits set (0xffffffff for a size_t). A write will go to
hyper-space, doing nothing.

There will be no such faults. You to use ioremap_nocache() first.
Remember to iounmap() when you are through.

If the access is through a port (in and out instructions), you
don't have to do anything, ports are always available in kernel
space.
BBBBUUUTTT!  If you write to somebody else's address-space like
a hard-disk controller, you can destroy all your data requiring
a complete re-installation of everything. That's why what you
want to do is NOT what you should do.
You need to have a competent programmer make a driver and
its attendant test-program to thoroughly test your board(s)
with no possibility of somebody entering wrong information.
