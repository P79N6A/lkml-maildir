Ok.

Not necessarily. The current code would though in practice, it doesn't
change much, but as I said, it would be trivial to change it so that a
domain using a linear reverse map is fully "allocated" when initialized.
Stable numbers are somewhat useful for users, thus one of the thing the
ppc code tries to do in order to get "mostly" stable numbers/names as
well is to try to use the HW number as a "starting" value when searching
for a linux irq number to assign. Only if it's not possible (the HW
number is in the reserved ISA range, too big, or the matching linux
number is already used) then it will allocate a new one.
I still think I need to add the domain and HW number to /proc/interrupts
though (or to some other sysfs file) in order to provide the mappign to
virqs to userland.
Also, if the eixsting linear and radix tree reverse maps don't fit your
needs, you can create a new one or request no reverse map from the core
at all and do everything in your arch code.
Basically, what I'm saying is that I'd like the concept of domain &
generic remappers to become generic. sparc64 and ppc use it and I'm
convinced it would be useful to other especially archs with lots of
cascaded PICs like ARM. And by doing so, we can also make it easier to
expose the HW -> virq mapping to userland in a common place with a
consistent format since it would be done by generic code.
Cheers,
Ben.
