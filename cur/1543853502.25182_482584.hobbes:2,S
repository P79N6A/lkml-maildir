You're looking at recent source to explain what happened in 2.6.8:
not a good strategy.  2.6.8 didn't even record file_rss and anon_rss
separately.  We split off anon_rss in 2.6.10, and changed the meaning
of "shared" then too - here's my ChangeLog comment justifying it.

[PATCH] statm: shared = rss - anon_rss
The third "shared" field of /proc/$pid/statm in 2.4 was a count of pages in
the mm whose page_count is more than 1 (oddly, including pages shared just
with swapcache).  That's too costly to calculate each time, so 2.6 changed
it to the total file-backed extent.  But Andrea knows apps and users
surprised when (rss - shared) goes negative: we need to provide an rss-like
statistic, close to the 2.4 interpretation.
Something that's quick and easy to maintain accurately is mm->anon_rss, the
count of anonymous pages in the mm.  Then shared = rss - anon_rss gives a
pretty good and meaningful approximation to 2.4's intention: wli confirms
that this will be useful to Oracle too.
Where to show it?  I think it's best to treat this as a bugfix and show it
in the third field of /proc/$pid/statm, after resident, as before - there's
no evidence that the total file-backed extent was found useful.
Albert would like other fields to revert to page counts, but that's a lot
harder: if mprotect can change the category of a page, then it can't be
accounted as simply as this.  Only go that route if real need shown.
