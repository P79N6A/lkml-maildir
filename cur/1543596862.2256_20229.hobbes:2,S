This stuff is gold.
Anyone clueful want to comment things so this will end up in the
documentation when you do a make docbook or something?
Having access to simple facts like this is of so much value to those
of us who simply just don't have the time and/or exposure and many of
you (oh, and of course some of us just aren't as clever and need a
little more help!)

    correct.

    yes, but it's not discontigmem issue, it is the other way around (page
    structure is valid but it maps to non ram, like the 640k-1M region that
    we have the page structure for, we don't use discontigmem for it because
    the hole is too smalle, but it is non ram, or also normal ram mapped by
    some device as dma region).

    that cannot happen, remap_pte_range only maps invalid pages or reserved
    pages.
