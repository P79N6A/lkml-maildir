Here's the fix I came up with for this.  Untested (my test boxes are
busy doing some aio+syslet perf runs :)).  What do you guys think?

async: return task_ret_reg() from async_cachemiss_loop()
When a thread blocks in __async_schedule() it finds a thread waiting in
async_cachemiss_loop() to return to userspace.  The return value of
async_cachemiss_loop() is propagated to userspace as the return code of the
call which the thread blocked in.
Previously this return code was hard-coded to 0 and -1, which worked fine for
the first syslet syscall APIs.  sys_io_submit() wants a different return call
convention when it uses syslets.  So cachemiss_thread() was changed to return
task_ret_reg(), sys_io_submit() would set it to the value it wanted returned to
userspace.
But this, by itself, was buggy.  The syslet syscall APIs didn't set
task_ret_reg() like sys_io_submit() did, so they got garbage returned.  Both
Jeff Dike and Chris Mason saw this in testing, though I was lucky enough to
have my returned garbage pass the tests I initially tried.  It also didn't
catch the other callers of async_cachemiss_loop() which would be returning to
userspace on behalf of calls which blocked in __async_schedule().  This would
be a problem, say, if people mixed sys_threadlet_on() and sys_io_submit() in
the same task.
So this patch fixes those up.
We always return task_ret_reg() from async_cachemiss_loop().  If we're
returning to the user's stack and IP instead of on behalf of a blocking call we
set task_ret_reg() to -1 and then return it.
__exec_atom() sets task_ret_reg() to NULL if there's a chance that it will
block while executing the syscall in the atom.
