This is indeed pretty useful.  A few comments on your version of the patch:
 - might as well post a patch this small inline
 - In Kconfig, what happens if someone turns on highmem?  It seems all
   the USER_XXX choices depend on NOHIGHMEM.  also, the config option
   probably needs at least some help text.
 - the change to vmlinux.ld.S can be dropped from future versions
   (Linus merged this post-2.6.8)
 - why create PAGE_OFFSET_RAW in asm-generic, when it depends on
   i386-only config symbols and is only used in i386?
 - what's the reason for the odd rewrite of free_one_pgd()? it looks
   equivalent (and misindented)
Thanks,
  Roland
