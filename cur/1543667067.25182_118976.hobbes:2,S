there's no positive feedback loop. What might happen is that in 2.5.65 we
now distribute the bonus timeslices more widely (the backboost thing), so
certain workloads might be rated more interactive. But we never give away
timeslices that were not earned the hard way (ie. via actual sleeping).
i've attached a patch that temporarily turns off the back-boost - does
that have any measurable impact? [please apply this to -mm1, i do think
the timeslice-granularity change in -mm1 (-D3) is something we really
want.]
