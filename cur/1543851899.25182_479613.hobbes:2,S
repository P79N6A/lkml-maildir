could you create a special /dev/mdx device which is used to 
assemble/create arrays only?  i mean literally "mdx" not "mdX" where X is 
a number.  mdx would always be there if md module is loaded... so udev 
would see the driver appear and then create the /dev/mdx.  then mdadm 
would use /dev/mdx to do assemble/creates/whatever and cause other devices 
to appear/disappear in a manner which udev is happy with.
(much like how /dev/ptmx is used to create /dev/pts/N entries.)
doesn't help legacy mdadm binaries... but seems like it fits the New World 
Order.
or hm i suppose the New World Order is to eschew binary interfaces and 
suggest a /sys/class/md/ hierarchy with a bunch of files you have to splat 
ascii data into to cause an array to be created/assembled.
