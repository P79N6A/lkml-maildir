I did a quick and dirty search on packet_type.data == NULL protocols.
Here is a list -
802/psnap.c
appletalk/ddp.c
ax25/af_ax25.c
core/ext8022.c
econet/af_econet.c
irda/irsyms.c
x25/af_x25.c
These need to be made safe for a non-BH based timer. I guess
the current code assumes serialization between timer and
BH context code due to the use of now-defunct NET_BH.

It should also be possible to make minimal non-smptimers 
bhless_timer patch - just in case smptimers isn't going in
any time soon. It will run a timer tasklet off of do_timer().
The tasklet handler still has to grab global_bh_lock and
the likes to keep the tty and other drivers that expect
serialization BH and timers or use __global_cli, happy.
Will such a patch be useful ?
Thanks
