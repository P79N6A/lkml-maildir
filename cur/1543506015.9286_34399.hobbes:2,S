Instructions aren't 128/3 since that's not an even number :-)
Someone can fill in the details, but instruction groups are 128 bits,
divided into 4 sections - 3 instructions and a tagging section that
describes the types of the 3 instructions.
The 128 bit instruction groups must be aligned.
I can only assume that WCHAN would contain the instruction group address.
