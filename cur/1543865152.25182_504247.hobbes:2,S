If libata is built as a module, putting libata.atapi_enabled=1 on the 
kernel command line won't work. In that case, try putting
options libata atapi_enabled=1
in /etc/modprobe.conf. Of course if libata is being loaded from the 
initrd that may not work, in which case the easiest solution is likely 
to just build it into the kernel so that the kernel command line method 
will work.
