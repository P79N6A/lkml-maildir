Sure, but it seems quite useful for this task.

For me, this is not a goal.
It might perhaps be a side effect, but I care about correctness, not 
about compile time.

It's not perfect, but it finds a subset of the problems.
There also other possible problems like stuff only used in a #define.
The perfect is the enemy of the good.

i don't think the header cleanup could be completely automated.
But if automated tools help that's a good thing.
