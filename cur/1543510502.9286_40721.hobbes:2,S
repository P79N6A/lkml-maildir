Latency? zero-copy TCP is not going to do anything to the latency,
since a NIC that does TCP checksumming on TX will have to do it as
'store and forward' since the checksum is in the header.  The world is
about bulk data transfers ;-)
I am still looking forward to the day when we will have zero-copy TX
support, it should give us even more performance on the Linux boxes
running our tape silos.
