The idea is right - I already had it in my tree, with some little changes (for 
instance including the symbol address and so on). So I'll send it reviewed a 
bit.
I had not yet sent it because there was more critical stuff and because 
sometimes on panic it does not work yet - this seems to be a missing flush 
from the UML console drivers :-(, a bit long to solve because currently the 
locking is broken (a semaphore is used in process context, nothing in 
interrupt context).
And removing the final Emacs comment is not welcome (I don't care, but Jeff 
does. If that should be removed, that's a separate problem).
Bye
