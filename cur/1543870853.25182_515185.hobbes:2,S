yeah.  It'd be worth spending some time, try to come up with some set of
commands which produce an effect which you find objectionable.

VM hasn't actually been tuned *for* anything much at all, really.  Looking
back on it, much of the tweaking in there has been to avoid really bad
situations.  We put much work into avoiding the 100%, 1000% or 10000%
slowdowns, but not a lot of work into providing the 15% speedups.
So it may well be that the result is not particularly great at anything,
but it's also not horridly bad at anything, either.  Or at least, it's not
supposed to be.

databases actually like to manage their own cache via various means.  There
are some situations in which bulk IO activities can trash the databases's
cache.  That's the sort of thing which this tool is trying to help address.

Well.  If the CPU scheduler makes a mistake, we see 5% or 15% degredations.
 If VM make a mistake (or fails to read the operator's mind), we go to disk
and can suffer 1000% degredations or worse.
