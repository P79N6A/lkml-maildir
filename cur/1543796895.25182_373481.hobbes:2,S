Again, specifics please?

devfs was documented for over a year that it would be removed.  This
after 2 year notice that it was going to be removed some time in the
future.  So for over 3 years people have known about this.
You have also notified people about the raw driver going away, what more
can we do about this?
And there will always be a need for new package upgrades for some small
subset of programs that are tightly tied to the kernel (like
wpa_supplicant or alsa-libs, or even udev).  But "normal" userspace
applicatations should not break, and if they do, we want to know about
it so we can fix it.
thanks,
