Sorry, Alan. <grabbing the printout of "UNIX PROGRAMMER'S MANUAL". Dated
November 3, 1971 (manual, not the printout ;-)>
      11/3/71						   SYS MKDIR (II)
NAME		mkdir -- make a directory
SYNOPSIS	sys mkdir; name; mode / mkdir = 14.
DESCRIPTION	mkdir creates an empty directory whose name is the null-
		terminated string pointed to by name. The mode of the di-
		rectory is mode. The special entries "." and ".." are not
		present.
		mkdir can only be invoked by the super-user.
FILES
SEE ASLO	mkdir command
DIAGNOSTICS	Error bit (c-bit) is set if the directory alread exists
		or if the user is not the super-user.
BUGS
OWNER		ken, dmr

Unlikely. Unless you mean creation of the normal links, that is. *That* is
relatively modern, syscall by itself isn't. I suspect that at some moment
it was replaced with unified syscall and was resurrected when the atomic
creation of links became an issue. Yup, that happened after v7.
