	As far as mingetty respawning to fast, that's almost certainly because
	you have an entry in /etc/iniitab which for /dev/tty[123456] which 	
isn't
	going to exist if you don't have a video card installed.  Edit
	/etc/inittab to fix that problem.

Maybe /dev/tty[123456] should be renamed to /dev/vc[123456]
How many years has it been since a tty (teletype) was even manufactured?
My kids did their grade 3 math on one, but the youngest is 39. I
personally find the ttySn tty, pty stuff pretty non intuitive. Obviously
the devfs junkies agree.
Cheers, Garst
