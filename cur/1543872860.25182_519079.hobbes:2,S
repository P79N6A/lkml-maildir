Did it always use ra->prev_page? ISTR it using pos%PAGE_SIZE == 0 at some
stage (ie. read from the start of a page -- obviously that also has holes).

Yeah it is there because that is basically how our "use once" detection
handles the case where an app does not read in chunks that are PAGE_SIZE
multiples and PAGE_SIZE aligned.
