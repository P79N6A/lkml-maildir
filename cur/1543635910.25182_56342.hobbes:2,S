Such driver would only work with ATAPI devices. Joerg, does not
seem to realize that the vast majority of IDE devices do not
support ATAPI at all. As a rule of thumb, winchesters do not,
CD-ROMs and such do, and tapes do too. To make a pseudo-HA
driver which speaks plain IDE and plugs into SCSI subsistem
would saddle the IDE with SCSI limitations, and add one more
layer for no benefit whatsoever.
