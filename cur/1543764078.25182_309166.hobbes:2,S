Yes. But how do you have _such_ an empty stack when the interrupt comes
in? See what I mean? IOW, that requires that the kernel stack would have
only two words on it when the interrupt happens. How?
It may be a 4kB stack issue or something. Does this happen only with
CONFIG_4KSTACKS, and just after a stack switch to an irq stack, for 
example?
So I definitely think the "bug" is in your optimization, I just think it 
should be a valid optimization and we should just make sure our kernel 
stack is never _so_ empty that "struct pt_regs" is not safe to 
dereference.
