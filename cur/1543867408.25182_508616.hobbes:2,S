Yes, I saw that. But there isn't any patch for me to test, and my
 userspace remains broken. Please don't get me wrong - I'm
 not bitching about this, but I will effectively not be able to test
 newer snapshots until either a fix for this new bug gets in, or
 the commit that introduced the bug gets reverted.
Thanks,
