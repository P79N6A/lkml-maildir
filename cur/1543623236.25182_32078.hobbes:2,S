writeback data order is important, mostly because of where the data blocks
are in relation to the log.  If you've got bdflush unloading data blocks
to the disk, and another process doing a commit, the drive's queue
might look like this:
data1, data2, data3, commit1, data4, data5 etc.
If commit1 is an ordered tag, the drive is required to flush 
data1, data2 and data3, then write the commit, then seek back
for data4 and data5.
If commit1 is not an ordered tag, the drive can write all the
data blocks, then seek back to get the commit.
