Ignoring PSH completely on RX would probably not be a worse heuristic 
than forcing an ACK on it. At least other stacks seem to do fine too 
without the force-ack-on-psh. I think you added it a long time ago, but 
I do not remember why you did it; but at least here is an counter example
now that may be a good case for a reconsider.
