From his technical knowledge he's as ok as many other developers are
who have been involved for several years now.
He tries to become the DVB Maintainer, from my side I wrote he first
has to prove it for at least a half year that he supports the project
and helps out people. Till now I haven't seen any response to the
technical questions I had.
And telling that the politicians here are so bad to everyone who'd
like to help finding a solution for it is definitelly the wrong way
either, so other people will not even be able to get an insight into
the whole story.

Since all these issues have been there for more than one year now it
either would be better that he leaves the project OR starts to
seriously discuss the issues and how it would be best to solve them
(and in a way where everyone agrees here)
He just nacks the changes proposed by Uwe which got implemented by
Trent and now Mauro wants to get it done somehow, either in a way
explaining what he wants to do with it in future or changing these few
lines NOW.
I couldn't care less what will happen with his driver, the whole story
gets blown up just because one party here doesn't understand that the
other one doesn't know what he wants to do (and if he seriously will
do something)

I fully agree with that.
