It's now or never. The new code solves several long-standing problems
(Matthias will gladly explain what the details) and improves the
performance significantly. Besides, it does not change much (if anything
at all) that will affect the ax25 utilities.

The 2.2.x kernel AX.25 does almost everything the 2.0.x version does,
with the exception that the axctl functions are broken (which are a
debugging aid for AX.25 hacker, anyway).
And, folks: Kernel 2.3.x is a *developer version*. It currently has
severe stability problems regarding the filesystems. Use at your
own risk, your mileage will vary, etc pp.
