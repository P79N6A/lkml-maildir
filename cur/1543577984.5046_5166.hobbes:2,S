You need to distinguish between SCSI-the-protocol and
SCSI-the-physical-layer. The term "SCSI" alone is simply too ambiguous to
be really useful anymore. I think you can use term "SCSI-1" or "SCSI-2"
when specicfally meaning SCSI protocol over classic 50 wire layer.
Saying "SCSI does not support hotplug" is very misleading.
Right now, the term "SCSI" is more akin to "IP".
