This is not only in -mm, but also in Linus' git tree. I just sent the 
patch below to Jeff (who is the author of the commit that broke it), which 
I believe might be correct:
[PATCH] fix reference to removed toshoboe_invalid_dev() in 
drivers/net/irda/donauboe.c
commit c31f28e778ab299a5035ea2bda64f245b8915d7c (which currently is in 
mainline) broke drivers/net/irda/donauboe.c, as it removes 
toshoboe_invalid_dev(), but this is called from toshoboe_interrupt() (your 
patch removed reference to it only from toshoboe_probeinterrupt().
