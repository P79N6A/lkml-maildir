Yes, we need one. The adapter needs to maintain these stats from the
registers in the kernel structure and not
its own local variables. That way, when someone calls to clear the stats
for testing and analysis purposes,
they zero out and are reset.
The code fragment above is in our analysis code not the kernel, but we
use it to test performance of various
vendor cards. It's provided as an example of this capability.
