The obvious suspect with a filesystem problem would be the disk 
controller driver, AHCI here. However, the controller appears to set the 
flag to indicate that it supports 64-bit DMA, so it should be fine, 
unless it lies of course (which we know that ATI SB600 chipset does, but 
I don't believe Intel is known to).
Could still be a DMA mapping bug that only shows up when IOMMU is used. 
However, AHCI is a pretty well tested driver..
