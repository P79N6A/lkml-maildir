You assume that using sys_indirect will be the norm.  It won't.  We
mustn't design system calls deliberately wrong so that they require the
indirection.
Beside, if the number of syscalls which has to be handled this way grows
we can use something more efficient for large numbers of test than a
switch statement.  It could even be a word next to the system call table.
But I still don't see that the magic encoding is a valid solution, it
doesn't address the limited parameter number.  Plus, using sys_indirect
could in future be used to transport entire parameters (like a sigset_t)
along with other information, thereby saving individual copy operations.
I think the sys_indirect approach is the way forward.  I'll submit a
last version of the patch in a bit.
