True.

Yes, I always get the "unexpected IRQ trap at vector 7d" message. This
is the same message even with different NICs (though they were placed in
the same PCI slot). About 30-120 seconds after this message (depending
on some driver timeout value I guess) the NETDEV watchdog kicks in with
a "eth0: transmit timed out".

That could indeed be a problem. But this will become clear pretty soon
once this APIC reprogramming workaround is actually implemented in the
kernel. Then I will be able to test that. Any ideas how this workaround
in the kernel would look like?
Thanks for the help,
