Assuming ints are 32-bits wide.  They don't have to be.  They could be
as narrow as 16 bits, in which case the constant will have type long
or unsigned long (because long must be at least 32 bits), or they
could be wider than 32 bits, in which case the constant will be signed
int instead of unsigned int.  You might lose either way.  It's
probably safer to make it explicitly UL, except perhaps in
machine-specific files where the width of types is well-known.
