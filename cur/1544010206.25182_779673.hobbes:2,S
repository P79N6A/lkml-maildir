Hi Andrew
Take v2 of this patch serie got no new feedback, maybe its time for mm
inclusion for a while ?
In this third version I added last two patches, one intialy from Christoph
Lameter, and one to avoid dirtying mnt->mnt_count on hardwired fs.
Many thanks to Christoph and Paul for this SLAB_DESTROY_PER_RCU work done
on "struct file".
Thank you
Short summary : Nice speedups for allocation/deallocation of sockets/pipes
(From 27.5 seconds to 1.62 s, on a 8 cpus machine)
Long version :
To allocate a socket or a pipe we :
0) Do the usual file table manipulation (pretty scalable these days,
but would be faster if 'struct file' were using SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU
and avoid call_rcu() cache killer). This point is addressed by 6th
patch.
1) allocate an inode with new_inode()
This function :
- locks inode_lock,
- dirties nr_inodes counter
- dirties inode_in_use list  (for sockets/pipes, this is useless)
- dirties superblock s_inodes.  - dirties last_ino counter
All these are in different cache lines unfortunatly.
2) allocate a dentry
d_alloc() takes dcache_lock,
insert dentry on its parent list (dirtying sock_mnt->mnt_sb->s_root)
dirties nr_dentry
3) d_instantiate() dentry  (dcache_lock taken again)
4) init_file() -> atomic_inc() on sock_mnt->refcount
At close() time, we must undo the things. Its even more expensive because
of the _atomic_dec_and_lock() that stress a lot, and because of two cache
lines that are touched when an element is deleted from a list
(previous and next items)
This is really bad, since sockets/pipes dont need to be visible in dcache
or an inode list per super block.
This patch series get rid of all but one contended cache lines for
sockets, pipes and anonymous fd  (signalfd, timerfd, ...)
socketallocbench is a very simple program (attached to this mail) that makes
a loop :
for (i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
    close(socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0));
Cost if one cpu runs the program :
real    1.561s
user    0.092s
sys     1.469s
Cost if 8 processes are launched on a 8 CPU machine
(socketallocbench -n 8) :
real    27.496s   <<<< !!!! >>>>
user    0.657s
sys     3m39.092s

This patch serie avoids all contented cache lines and makes this "bench"
pretty fast.
New cost if run on one cpu :
real    1.245s (instead of 1.561s)
user    0.074s
sys     1.161s
If run on 8 CPUS :
real    1.624s
user    0.580s
sys     12.296s
On oprofile, we finally can see network stuff coming at the front of
expensive stuff. (with the exception of kmem_cache_[z]alloc(), because
it has to clear 192 bytes of file structures, this takes half of the time)

This patch serie contains 7 patches, against linux-2.6 tree,
plus one patch in mm (fs: filp_cachep can be static in fs/file_table.c)
[PATCH 1/7] fs: Use a percpu_counter to track nr_dentry
Adding a percpu_counter nr_dentry avoids cache line ping pongs
between cpus to maintain this metric, and dcache_lock is
no more needed to protect dentry_stat.nr_dentry
We centralize nr_dentry updates at the right place :
- increments in d_alloc()
- decrements in d_free()
d_alloc() can avoid taking dcache_lock if parent is NULL
("socketallocbench -n 8" bench result : 27.5s to 25s)
[PATCH 2/7] fs: Use a percpu_counter to track nr_inodes
Avoids cache line ping pongs between cpus and prepare next patch,
because updates of nr_inodes dont need inode_lock anymore.
("socketallocbench -n 8" bench result : no difference at this point)
[PATCH 3/7] fs: Introduce a per_cpu last_ino allocator
new_inode() dirties a contended cache line to get increasing
inode numbers.
Solve this problem by providing to each cpu a per_cpu variable,
feeded by the shared last_ino, but once every 1024 allocations.
This reduce contention on the shared last_ino, and give same
spreading ino numbers than before.
(same wraparound after 232 allocations)
("socketallocbench -n 8" result : no difference)
[PATCH 4/7] fs: Introduce SINGLE dentries for pipes, socket, anon fd
Sockets, pipes and anonymous fds have interesting properties.
Like other files, they use a dentry and an inode.
But dentries for these kind of files are not hashed into dcache,
since there is no way someone can lookup such a file in the vfs tree.
(/proc/{pid}/fd/{number} uses a different mechanism)
Still, allocating and freeing such dentries are expensive processes,
because we currently take dcache_lock inside d_alloc(), d_instantiate(),
and dput(). This lock is very contended on SMP machines.
This patch defines a new DCACHE_SINGLE flag, to mark a dentry as
a single one (for sockets, pipes, anonymous fd), and a new
d_alloc_single(const struct qstr *name, struct inode *inode)
method, called by the three subsystems.
Internally, dput() can take a fast path to dput_single() for
SINGLE dentries. No more atomic_dec_and_lock()
for such dentries.
Differences betwen an SINGLE dentry and a normal one are :
1) SINGLE dentry has the DCACHE_SINGLE flag
2) SINGLE dentry's parent is itself (DCACHE_DISCONNECTED)
This to avoid taking a reference on sb 'root' dentry, shared
by too many dentries.
3) They are not hashed into global hash table (DCACHE_UNHASHED)
4) Their d_alias list is empty
(socket8 bench result : from 25s to 19.9s)
[PATCH 5/7] fs: new_inode_single() and iput_single()
Goal of this patch is to not touch inode_lock for socket/pipes/anonfd
inodes allocation/freeing.
SINGLE dentries are attached to inodes that dont need to be linked
in a list of inodes, being "inode_in_use" or "sb->s_inodes"
As inode_lock was taken only to protect these lists, we avoid taking it as well.
Using iput_single() from dput_single() avoids taking inode_lock
at freeing time.
This patch has a very noticeable effect, because we avoid dirtying of three contended cache lines in new_inode(), and five cache lines
in iput()
("socketallocbench -n 8" result : from 19.9s to 3.01s)
[PATH 6/7] fs: struct file move from call_rcu() to SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU
From: Christoph Lameter <cl@linux-foundation.org>
Currently we schedule RCU frees for each file we free separately. That has
several drawbacks against the earlier file handling (in 2.6.5 f.e.), which
did not require RCU callbacks:
1. Excessive number of RCU callbacks can be generated causing long RCU
  queues that in turn cause long latencies. We hit SLUB page allocation
  more often than necessary.
2. The cache hot object is not preserved between free and realloc. A close
  followed by another open is very fast with the RCUless approach because
  the last freed object is returned by the slab allocator that is
  still cache hot. RCU free means that the object is not immediately
  available again. The new object is cache cold and therefore open/close
  performance tests show a significant degradation with the RCU
  implementation.
One solution to this problem is to move the RCU freeing into the Slab
allocator by specifying SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU as an option at slab creation
time. The slab allocator will do RCU frees only when it is necessary
to dispose of slabs of objects (rare). So with that approach we can cut
out the RCU overhead significantly.
However, the slab allocator may return the object for another use even
before the RCU period has expired under SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU. This means
there is the (unlikely) possibility that the object is going to be
switched under us in sections protected by rcu_read_lock() and
rcu_read_unlock(). So we need to verify that we have acquired the correct
object after establishing a stable object reference (incrementing the
refcounter does that).

[PATCH 7/7] fs: MS_NOREFCOUNT
Some fs are hardwired into kernel, and mntput()/mntget() hit a contended
cache line. We define a new superblock flag, MS_NOREFCOUNT, that is set
on socket, pipes and anonymous fd superblocks. mntput()/mntget() become
null ops on these fs.
