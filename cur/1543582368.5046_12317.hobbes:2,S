While I understand that internal docs and source are often simply a mess, I
fail to see why this should prevent a company from releasing specs or
source.
Sure somebody will come along and say "What on earth were you people
THINKING?!", and then they'll get over it and do something useful with the
specs and/or source to the drivers (or if they don't, somebody else will)
I seriously doubt it'd lead to a company seeing a drop in sales because of
it... and even if they did, I'd say it's a calculated risk, as they could
well pick up a higher number of new customers than the number of old
customers they lost due to wider ranging support.
And even if their specs and code were the worst peices of trash on the
planet, I'd still thank them for opening them up to the public.
