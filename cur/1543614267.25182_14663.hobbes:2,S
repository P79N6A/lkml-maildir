Lilo (broken), syslinux (not very difficult), GRUB, (already implemented).
The list is not long. It's little differeent then a boot loader supporting
initrd loading.

Which is why all of that shit that loads multiple initrd floppies, etc,
etc should be gutting and replaced with a solid initrd system that
can load tar.gz's to tmpfs. Jeez...I happen to have such a patch RIGHT 
HERE....for 3 years now. (minix prior to tmpfs existance...)
Loading initrd and boot time kernel modules, from multiple sources,
belongs in 'pre-kernel' (prom/bootloader) land. Most importantly this
boot loader is already implemented for IA32.

Already done (properly) in GRUB. Userland (after the kernel boots) is
no place for this. It's too late to be done cleanly. I agree the kernel
is no place either.

This is a very much a failed concept. In theory it sounds nice. My
experience in
	1) implementing a Linux OS from scratch
	2) administering multiple networks of mission critical servers
says this doesn't work well.
