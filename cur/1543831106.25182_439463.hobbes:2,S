Answers with respect to how I see layer 2 isolation,
with network devices and sockets as well as the associated routing
information given per namespace.

Wrong question.  A better question is to ask how do you know which namespace
a packet is in.  
Answer:  By looking at which device or socket it just came from.
How do you get a packet into a non-default namespace?
Either you move a real network interface into that namespace.
Or you use a tunnel device that shows up as two network interfaces in
two different namespaces.
Then you route, or bridge packets between the two.  Trivial.

Just like we do now.

All network devices are abstractions of the hardware so they are all
sort of virtual.  My implementation of a tunnel device has a mac
address so I can use it with ethernet bridging but that isn't a hard
requirement.  And yes the mac address is different because you can't
do layer 2 switching if everyone has the same mac address.
But there is no special ``virtual'' device.

Manage?

Like you always do.  It would be a terrible implementation if
we had to change that logic.  There is a little bit of that
where we need to detect which network namespace we are going to because
the answers can differ but that is pretty straight forward.

Then look at:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiederm/linux-2.6-ns.git#proof-of-concept
or the OpenVZ implementation.  
It isn't serious overhead.

The socket should remember it's network namespace.
It works fine.

Just like we always do?
