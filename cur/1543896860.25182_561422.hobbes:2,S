While I agree in principle that less work for the end user who wants
it to "just work" is good (if done correctly), I think this is more an
issue of where the scheduler is being put to work. In a desktop
environment, I'd agree that you would want the player > encoder, but

compile time option to configure the scheduler for the environment it
will be working in.
I do think however that the default in most cases should be "it just
works" with the option of turning on the more advanced features.
