There are mostly two things which did this.
One is that Mauro translated almost all of the V4L1 radio card drivers to
V4L2.  The changes are all very repetitive, but it made a huge diffstat:
 15 files changed, 1758 insertions(+), 918 deletions(-)
The second source is the dvb_attach() system, which was not supposed to go
in 2.6.18, it was for 2.6.19.

The dvb_attach() stuff isn't ready for 2.6.18, it hasn't been tested at all
and it's a very significant change.  The ISA radio card drivers....  I
don't think they are used very much anymore.
