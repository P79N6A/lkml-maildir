Of course, you'll be able to do voice or v.21, because that's about
everything we've got just now ;-).

That is not true. I've seen SuSE + Toshiba asking them for drivers.

PS: Actually, lucent drivers can pretty happily live in
userspace. (They only need interrupt. In case that irq is not shared
(common case) it is chance to do this in userland). I
guess non-opensourced binaries are much better than binary-only kernel
drivers.
