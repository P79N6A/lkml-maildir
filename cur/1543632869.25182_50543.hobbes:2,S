Subject: Conflicting symbols of zlib (jffs2 and ppp_deflate)

Hello !!!
I've found out something that probably is a bug. I've tried to compile a 
kernel using the generic ppp (and the ppp_deflate module) and the jffs2 file 
system. 
No problems at the compilation but when the linker started off it complained 
about conflicting symbols in net.o and fs.o objects.
Taking a more carefully look at the problem I discovered that the files 
zlib.c and zlib.h are in two differents places in the kernel (fs/jffs2/ and 
drivers/net/) and the diff of the files don't show any significant difference.
As a workaround for this problem I removed the zlib.o from fs/jffs2/Makefile 
but it wouldn't work if I wasn't using the ppp stuff.
I'd like to know if anyone (ppp and jffs2 guys) have a solution for this 
problem or at least a suggestion. Any comment will be very welcomed.
thanks
henrique
