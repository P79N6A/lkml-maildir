ah, just took a closer look at this.  from <linux/pm_legacy.h>:
...
#ifdef CONFIG_PM_LEGACY
...
#else
#define PM_IS_ACTIVE() 0
...
#endif
so if you choose not to configure legacy PM, that macro equates to
false and that "if" construct in arch/i386/kernel/apm.c doesn't come
into play, anyway.
so i re-iterate what i posted in my earlier e-mail -- if APM and ACPI
want to avoid clashing, they have to do it without invoking anything
related to legacy PM.

p.s.  if someone wants to take that previously-submitted patch
proposal and tidy it up and submit it officially, feel free.
