 Hi, James.
 Sorry about late reply.  Been busy and currently on the run, so please
excuse me for being brief.
 * A command is passed to lldd and starts execution
 * It times out.
 * eh runs
 * abort isn't implemented or fails
 * eh issues eh cmd (TUL, STU...)
 * The command miraculously & stupidly completes just now.
 * The lldd succeeds to delete timer and normal completion path runs.
 * We're fucked up now.
 If anything is wrong, please point out.
 Thanks.  Gotta go.
