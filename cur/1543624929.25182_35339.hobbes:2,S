Like I said, I know why BK is going what it is doing.  That doesn't 
change the fact that peoples options are very poor in this case.

That's what I meant by option #1...  you yelled at me, rightly, when I 
first tried to send BK patches to Linus, because I used 'bk export'.  If 
you have to leave the BK system entirely for certain cases of merging, 
that's really a failing of the system.  So, I chastise you back for even 
suggesting 'export' :)
Basically you need out of order changes to do it right...
I think a fair question would be, is this scenario going to occur often? 
 I don't know.  But I'll bet you -will- see it come up again in kernel 
development.  Why?  We are exercising the distributed nature of the 
BitKeeper system.  The system currently punishes Joe in Alaska and 
Mikhail in Russia if they independently apply the same GNU patch, and 
then later on wind up attempting to converge trees.
Do you see what I'm getting at?  In a widely distributed SCM system for 
an open source project, chances are -good- that some random two or more 
people will independently apply the same patch.
