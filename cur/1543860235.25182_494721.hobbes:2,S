Well, that was a really _old_ fedora kernel. I guarantee you it didn't 
have the page throttling patches in it, those were written this summer. So 
it would either have to be Fedora carrying around another patch that just 
happens to result in the same corruption for _years_, or it's the same 
bug.
I bet it's the same bug, and it's been around for ages.
