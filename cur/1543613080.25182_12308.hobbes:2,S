I know I'm stepping into a minefield, but I just can't help putting in
my 2 pennies.  :-)

I agree with Anton.  Files have certain characteristics that we all
know and love, stream-style attributes have pretty-much those same
characteristics.  IMHO, we would like EAs to have a different set of
characteristics so that the application programmer has different tools
in her toolbox.  To continue the analogy: "if all you have is a hammer,
everything looks like a nail".  Give someone that _already has_ a hammer
a screwdriver and they will be confused for a while but will end up
happier than if you gave them a "better hammer".
Thanks,
