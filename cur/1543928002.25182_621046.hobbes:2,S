Hm, this is a good argument for having such a web interface, but IMO it
shouldn't be mandatory.  IOW, there should be a way to report a bug using plain
email, if the reporter prefers that.  We can, however, request that the address
of our bug tracking system be added to the report's Cc list.
Now, the question is what information this web interface should ask for.
IMO, first, it should ask for what the bug is against, ie.:
- kernel version (to be obtained from 'git describe' or from /proc/version or
  from .config, if the kernel doesn't boot)
- architecture (x86, ARM, MIPS etc.)
- subsystem and subsubsystem (that could be selectable from a menu and might
  depend on the architecture)
It also should ask if the problem is a regression and what was the last known
good kernel (I'd prefer that to be the last known major release selectable from
a list).
Also, the reporter should be required to provide a summary (subject) and
a (concise) description of the problem and a list of email addresses to
send the report to in addition to the regular handling (there should be a way
to verify which addresses are acceptable).
Anything else?
Next, the report should be sent to a mailing list selected on the basis of the
information provided (not necessarily to individual developers, unless there
are some addresses provided explicitly by the reporter).
IMO, it should be possible to work on the bug using both email and the web
interface, whichever is preferred by the participant in question, without the
need to stick to any of them (ie. email messages sent in the corresponding
email thread should be registered by the bug tracking system and comments
entered into it should appear as messages in the email thread with the
appropriate To:, From: and Cc: information).
There surely are more things that we'd like it to do, but the above seem to be
a reasonable minimum.

Let's collect these opitions, then, and try to find a solution that would
satisfy all of them or at least the majority of them.
