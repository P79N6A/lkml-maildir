_NO_!!!
This is a _bad thing_, if a distribution wants to do it to their tree,
fine, but why add extra layers of complexity that a lot of devlopers
don't care about just so that the source tree 'looks nice'?  It's
absolutely pointless, and irritating for anybody actually trying to
work on the codebase.

It's _counter productive_ just to bodge it so that make allyesconfig
works.  I _want_ it to _fail_ if the drivers are _broken_.
A CONFIG_KNOWN_BROKEN option is a good thing, in the case where,
E.G. a SCSI driver is broken, and will randomly corrupt data, but
otherwise compiles and appears to work.  Apart from that, it's a
complete waste of time to fiddle around with silly options that do
nothing but bloat the codebase and waste developers' time.
John.
