Set this up on my laptop yesterday with some awesome results. I'm
using 2.6.17-ck1 which has v2.1.
Heres some bootcharts, before, after, and a prime run.

Repeated boots show about the same 6 second improvement, 32 down to 26
seconds. Looking at the slowdowns in the fs-fcache run, most are due
to cpu load, waiting on network or, modprobe, and not disk access. X
now starts nearly instantaneously.
As an experiment, I primed my cache right through to logging into my
desktop environment. It was so effective, that now when I login, the
GNOME splash screen only flickers onto the screen briefly, and the
panels appear almost instantly. This is a big improvment over without
fcache, where you'd see each component of GNOME being loaded on the
splash screen, nautilus, metacity, and the panels would take quite a
bit of time to render and load all their applets.
Impressive work, I hope to see it broadened to other filesystems,
improved and merged to vanilla soon because it has clear improvements.
