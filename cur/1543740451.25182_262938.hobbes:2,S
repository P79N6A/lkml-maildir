Not too long ago, some people were experimenting with nVidia cards and 
trying to use them as part of a renderer.  One of the things they found 
was that although the GPU was orders of magnitude faster at rendering 
than was the host CPU, the time it took to get the commands onto the 
card and the results back off was so high that it eliminated most of the 
advantage.
I have before thought of the idea of selling a "card full of FPGAs" that 
developers could use for all sorts of compute-intensive projects.  You 
could program them to do rendering or protein folding or FFT's for SETI. 
  But in that case, I'm not sure what Tech-Source's value add would be, 
since you'd have to get all of your software tools from the FPGA vendor.
