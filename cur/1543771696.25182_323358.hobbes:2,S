I'm testing an Adaptec SCSI controller + an IBM drive.  All the things
used to be fine before I had made the low-level format of the drive
(thru the Ctrl-A Adaptec's menu).  And now after
        modprobe aic7xxx
I have:
scsi0 : Adaptec AIC7XXX EISA/VLB/PCI SCSI HBA DRIVER, Rev 6.2.36

The message
scsi0:A:0:0: DV failed to configure device.  Please file a bug report against this driver.
had never appeared before the low-level format.  But it seems that
after the format the drive still works fine.
So, what does this message mean?  And can I just ignore it?
Some additional info: it's the PCI64 card installed in a 32-bit PCI
slot, Domain Validation is turned on thru the Adaptec BIOS setup.
Thanks in advance.
