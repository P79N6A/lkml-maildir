And I still run and use a platform where the GUI issues cardmgr ioctls.
A recent kernel upgrade (from 2.6.9ish to something more recent) broke
the "eject" GUI button applet due to the fscking with the cardmgr ioctls,
and it thinks the wireless card is always plugged in (and therefore the
signal strength meter remains.)
With all the ioctls gone I'll probably loose the signal strength meter.
And no, I don't have the resources (read: code) to fix and rebuild
userspace since I didn't snarf them when the CVS server was alive a
few years back.
That's the problem with API changes - things always break.
