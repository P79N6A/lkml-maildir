Subject: [PATCH 001 of 2] md: Fix formatting error in /proc/mdstat.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

If an md array is "auto-read-only", then this appears in /proc/mdstat
as
   /dev/md0: active(auto-read-only)
whereas if it is truely readonly, it appears as
   /dev/md0: active (read-only)
The difference being a space. 
One program known to parse this file expects the space and gets badly
confused.  It will be fixed, but it would be best if what the kernel
generates is more consistent too.
