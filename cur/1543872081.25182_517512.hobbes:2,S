The reason for the special function, was not to provide a non-blocking 
behaviour with zero timeout (that just a side effect), but to read the 
siginfo. I was all about using read(2) (and v1 used it), but when you have 
to transfer complex structures over it, it becomes hell. How do you 
cleanly compat over a f_op->read callback for example?
