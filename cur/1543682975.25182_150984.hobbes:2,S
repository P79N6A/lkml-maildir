hmm, i have a lot of huge files on different hard drives and wish to access 
them in a uniform fashion. i would like to sort ALL files in subdirectories 
but have no need for an LVM, RAID or similar. for example:
/mnt/drive1/category1
/mnt/drive1/category2
/mnt/drive2/category1
/mnt/drive2/category2
(the data is so huge, that it is not possible to always merge categories on a 
single disk!)
what i would like to do now is to be able to display all files of "cat1" and 
"cat2" respectively in "/mnt/union/category1" and "/mnt/union/category2". yet 
i don't wish to simply link the directories as this would complicate access 
with growing number of hard drives the data is spread on!
it's a bit weird to explain, i hope it's understandable now :-)))
