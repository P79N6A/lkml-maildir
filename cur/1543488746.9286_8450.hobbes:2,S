Looking at the sources, it would seem that it is possible for a process
without some desired capabilities (e.g. CAP_SYS_MODULE) to modify execution
(using ptrace, signals, /proc etc) of another process with those
capabilities but with the same uid.
Would this look like possible fix:
-allow if (current->uid == child->euid)...
+allow if (current->uid == child->euid &&
  cap_issubset(child->cap_permitted, current->cap_permitted)...
