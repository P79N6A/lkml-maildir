With my Maxtor disk connected to a PIIX3 IDE interface and stock kernel 2.4.19, I get this behavior:
# hdparm -Y /dev/hda
Disk sleeps
# find
No disk activity - it doesn't wake up.  It doesn't work once for me, it always hangs on the first attempt.
So, I try dmesg on another console - no new output.
# hdparm -w /dev/hda
Performs a device reset, and the disk spins up.
# dmesg
hda: ide_set_handler: handler not null; c0181050
hda: dma_intr: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hda: DMA disabled
hda: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=c0181050, new=c017b160
bug: kernel timer added twice at c017afe1.
hda: ide_set_handler: handler not null; old=c017b160, new=c017b160
ide0: reset: success
Obviously, if you're going to try to repeat this, sync the disk beforehand, because I assume that a device reset will loose data in the disk's write cache.
John.
