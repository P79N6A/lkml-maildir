hi,
I don't see why, it used to work reliably at some point but now it does
not. It even won't work without hotplug and then manually typing:
echo 1 > /sys/class/firmware/2-1/loading
cat /lib/firmware/BCM2033-FW.bin >/sys/class/firmware/2-1/data
echo 0 > /sys/class/firmware/2-1/loading
usb 2-1: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 2
Bluetooth: Broadcom Blutonium firmware driver ver 1.0
bcm203x_probe: Mini driver request failed
bcm203x: probe of 2-1:1.0 failed with error -5
usbcore: registered new driver bcm203x
It does not work with kernel 2.6.10/11 any ideas ?
