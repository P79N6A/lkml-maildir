Not really. We could fix this by making the page freeing
functions smarter and only free the pages we need.
I just don't know if this is worth it for 0.5% of the 
allocations (and further more, since we allocate the
1-page allocations directly from the cache when we're
low on free memory, fragmentation isn't as bad as it
used to be with the old VM).
regards,
Rik
