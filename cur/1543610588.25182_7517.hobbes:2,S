The reason Intel came up with the name "Pentium" is that a judge ruled 
they couldn't trademark a number like "386" or "486" to stop AMD from using 
it.  Just a data point.  What the law REALLY says these days is anybody's 
guess, and you can be sure somebody's lobbying to make it worse...
The law is a lot like poker: bluffing and wagering more than your opponent 
can afford is often more important than what your cards say.  The MS 
antitrust trial shows how when you stonewall it can take years for any 
enforcement action to work its way through the bureaucracy, by which point 
the issue is moot.  And the RIAA shows how somebody without a leg to stand on 
can get a really biased and/or ignorant judge to decide that PI should 
henceforth be 3 in all government documents.  But if you live your life in 
fear of being sued, you can't even go out and buy groceries...
So a vendor THREATENING to sue is normal.  Making threats is really cheap.  
Actually following through requires spending money and taking a potential 
public relations hit that can make it onto yahoo's business report where 
investors read it and drive the stock price down, which they'd generally 
rather like to avoid.  Doesn't mean they won't, but it doesn't mean a form 
letter on company letterhead justifies digging a bomb shelter...
