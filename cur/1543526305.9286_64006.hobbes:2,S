I had the same problem on upgrading from 2.3.39 to 2.3.46.  I finally
got mine to work (except it was 'Creative SB16 PnP') once I used
/proc/isapnp to set up and activate the card manually, then loaded the
sb module with all the io/irq/dma info specified, and with isapnp=0
set.  This seems like a heavy-handed kludge which shouldn't be
necessary, though.
