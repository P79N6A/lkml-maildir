Streaming I/O wants read-ahead.  Filesystems themselves implement the
write-behind and we do not want to circumvent so much of the kernel.
The point of O_STREAMING is one change: drop pages in the pagecache
behind our current position, that are free-able, because we know we will
never want them.  Its a hint from the application saying "I will never
revisit this so dump it".
O_DIRECT is a much bigger can of worms.  You lose a lot of what the
kernel provides.  You have to do things in block-sized chunks.  Etc.
etc.

Yep.  Linux treats most "hints" (e.g. madvise) as a requirement - it
fails if it cannot do it.  That is against the spec most of the time,
but oh well...

Shrug.  I do not have much experience with O_DIRECT.  I suspect the
synchronous nature and the requirement of aligned buffers is not ideal.
With O_STREAMING you can simply set the flag and use your normal I/O and
normal interfaces and have a field day.
Andrew, any experience on one vs. the other?
