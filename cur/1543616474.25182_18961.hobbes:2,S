nice -20 is an equivalent but safe version of the same (if you use my
patches). I made priority levels -20 ... -16 to be 'super-high priority',
ie. such tasks never expire. (they can still drop above prio -16 if they
use up too much CPU time, so they cannot lock up systems accidentally like
RT tasks.) So it's in essence a 'admin priority', for super-important
shells. I'm using it with great success.
