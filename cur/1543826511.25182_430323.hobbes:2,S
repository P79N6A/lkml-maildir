The idea is that the memory that is already used is tested. And the machine should
be still usable.
If you want a generic memory eater you can use memhog from numactl.
It's mainly a quick test for machines that error out when they detect
a 2 bit errors using ECC. And when run for longer it tends to stress
other parts of the motherboard like VRMs.
At least on Opterons with ECC memory it seems to detect most memory problems
pretty reliably, that is why I suggested it to Martin.
