Okay, I should have documented that.
Here is the explanation.
The previous code did something like,
if (error) goto out_err;
....
do {
             struct au1000_pcmcia_socket *skt = PCMCIA_SOCKET(i);
              del_timer_sync(&skt->poll_timer);
               pcmcia_unregister_socket(&skt->socket);
out_err:
               flush_scheduled_work();
               ops->hw_shutdown(skt);
               i--;
} while (i > 0)
.....
1. On the error path, skt would not contain a valid value for the
first iteration (skt is masked by uninitialized automatic skt)
2. does not do hw_shutdown() for 0th element of PCMCIA_SOCKET
Does it sound good?
Regards,
Om.
