I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss it. There are enough physical
placement issues already even without pinned userspace pages.
Empowering the kernel to remain largely oblivious to physical placement
of userspace pages would be very convenient and eliminate many problems.
Also, given that the alternatives are IO and allocation failure, I
wouldn't be so quick to dismiss it as slow, either. Unfortunately even
page relocation is only a half-measure while mapping->gfp_mask persists.
