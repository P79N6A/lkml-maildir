If I may ask, how does it work right now?  Ceiling is set at constant value
irrespective to nice value.  Are you saying current code is broken as well?
        ceiling = JIFFIES_TO_NS(MAX_SLEEP_AVG -
                  DEF_TIMESLICE);
        if (p->sleep_avg < ceiling)
                  p->sleep_avg = ceiling;
We maybe also misunderstand each other.  I'm not arguing of removing the
ceiling. Having a ceiling is the right thing to do here.  What I don't like
is that 2.6.17-rc4 has the ceiling set too high, and your patch also does
an inversion of the ceiling value w.r.t nice value.  So it's the detail of
what's the right value for priority boost that I'm uncomfortable with.
