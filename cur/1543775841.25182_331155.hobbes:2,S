Does setkeycode work with current kernels? When I try to set a keycode, I 
always get following error:
dominik@box # LANG="C" setkeycodes e03e 84
KDSETKEYCODE: Invalid argument
failed to set scancode be to keycode 84
but my dmesg output tells me, that this should be ok:
atkbd.c: Unknown key released (translated set 2, code 0xbe on isa0060/serio0).
atkbd.c: Use 'setkeycodes e03e <keycode>' to make it known.
so, is the output from atkbd.c wrong, or does setkeycodes work in the wrong 
way?
cheers,
dominik
