that path can take as long as timeslice to run, not taking interrupts
for a whole scheduler timeslice is pretty bad.
Note that the data structure will become a tree soon, but a prio-tree,
walking it with RCU lockless sounds very tricky to me, but it may be
doable. For the short term I doubt you want the RCU prio-tree, I guess
you want to stabilze the kernel first with the irq safe spinlock, then
you can try to hack on the prio-tree to read it in a lockless fascion.
If you can make the reading lockless we can giveup the abstraction too,
since we can make all archs walk with lockless, but warning, freeing
vmas in rcu callbacks means freeing mm in rcu callbacks, that then means
freeing pgd in rcu callbacks, the whole mm layer will collapse on you as
soon as you try to read that tree without any locking, only the inode
will be still there as far as you've a reference on the page (and as far
as you don't use nonlinear :-/ ).
