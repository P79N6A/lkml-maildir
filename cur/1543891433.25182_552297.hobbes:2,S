AppArmor isn't trying to defend everyday users from getting phished or
social engineered; it is trying to protect servers from getting rooted
because of security holes in their network daemons.  I find that a
laudable goal.  Sure, it doesn't solve every security problem in the
world, but so what?  A tool that could solve that one security problem
would still be a useful thing, even if it did nothing else.
I don't find the Windows stuff too relevant here.  As I understand it,
AppArmor isn't aimed at defending Windows desktop users; it is aimed at
defending Linux servers.  A pretty different environment, I'd say.
Ultimately, there are some things AppArmor may be good at, and there
are also sure to be some things it is bloody useless for.  My hammer
isn't very good for screwing in screws, but I still find it useful.
I confess I don't understand the kvetching about AppArmor's goals.
What are you expecting, some kind of silver bullet?
A question I'd find more interesting is whether AppArmor is able to
meet its stated goals, under a reasonable threat model, and with what
degree of assurance, and at what cost.  But I don't know whether that's
relevant for the linux-kernel mailing list.
