Sorry to join this discussion so late.
ACPI tells us the resources used by devices.  Today, we don't reserve
ACPI resources until a driver claims a device.  PCI does some sort of
reservation up front, before the driver claims devices.  Conceptually,
I think ACPI should do the same thing, and I don't think it's that
hard to do.
But breaking things like lmsensors would make the transition painful.
