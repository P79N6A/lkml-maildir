I don't know what you mean by groups (a nonempty set G with binary
operation * s.t. G is associativity, there exists e in G s.t. e*a=a*e=a,
and there exists i in G s.t. i*b=b*i=e?).
System calls are implemented per-architecture.  You can see the list at
the bottom of arch/i386/kernel/entry.S.  There is about 290.
System calls are prefixed by "sys_".  Thus, read(2) is implemented in
the kernel as sys_read().  It, for example, can be found in
fs/read_write.c.
Hope this helps.
