While all config programs should be able to handle this, it might look a
bit strange. Especially the split view of xconfig relies a bit on the
current organisation of the config data.
My idea to handle this would be to turn e.g.:
menu "Memory Technology Devices (MTD)"
config MTD
	tristate "Memory Technology Device (MTD) support"
into something like this:
menuconfig MTD
	tristate "Memory Technology Device (MTD) support"
This would give the front ends the most flexibility. The required
changes are quite small, so it should be doable for 2.6. I'm not
completely sure about the syntax yet, but above is the most likely
version.
bye, Roman
