Where (in make menuconfig) is the option to turn
on /dev/audio and /dev/dsp support in 2.2.3?  I
swear I saw it in 2.2.1.  Did it gat relabled?
Also, I have always though (since 2.0.x days)
that sound would be alot easier to configure if
the configuration options to turn on/off sound
hardware support were clearly visually seperated
from the options to turn on/off the device file
interfaces to such hardware...
Comments?
