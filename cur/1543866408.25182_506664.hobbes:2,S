Agreed. There's lots of problems with the interface (imho), but my biggest
two issues are the page lock being held on ->prepare_write() /
->commit_write() and the fact that the file system only sees the write one
page at a time

I like ->perform_write(). It allows the file system to make re-use of the
checks in the generic write path, but gives a maximum amount of information
about the overall operation to be done. There's an added advantage in that
some file systems (ocfs2 is one of these) want to be more careful about
ordering page locks, which should be much easier with it.
If this goes in, it could probably be helpful to me in some of the code I'm
currently writing which needs to be better about page lock / cluster lock
ordering and wants to see as much of the (allocating) writes as possible.
