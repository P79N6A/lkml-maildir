Because a driver has over 10,000 lines of code does not mean it is a 
quality driver.

Petr is expressing his political view. It has nothing to do with technical 
arguments. In fact I place a bet. I will port the matrox driver and it 
will have the same functionality as the previous driver except for text 
mode support. If I can't do it I will not only revert the changes but I 
will give Petr his wetdream. I will start inetergrating vt.c and 
vt_ioctl.c into each fbdev driver. Each fbdev driver will be its own 
console system. We will not longer need vt.c and vt_ioctl.c as each driver 
will have its own version intergated into the driver. Sound fair?
