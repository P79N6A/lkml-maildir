Sounds like a valid bugfix then - but it should probably be sent upstream
separately, with it's own changelog (what I quoted above should be fine)...
Remember - one patch, one logical change, so your patch should be split up
(among other things, that way the bugfix can proceed even if the new-function
part gets hung up in review).....
Other than splitting it up, I have no further comments on either part.. Enjoy...
