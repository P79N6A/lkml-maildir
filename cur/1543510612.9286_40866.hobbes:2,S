Subject: [patch] bttv "tv remotes" support (needs review)

A first attempt at bttv tv remote support is at:
http://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~rggammon/bttv-remotes-2.3.9.patch
It supports remotes connected to the general purpose io register on the
bt848 chip. 
It works for me, but I'm new to device drivers. I highly doubt it's
perfect.
Any words of advice as to what needs fixing are greatly appreciated
(please CC me if possible, as I'm not subscribed).
The code is somewhat derived from my work, and that of a couple of other
people on the lirc project.
Thanks!
