Subject: [PATCHES 0-12/12] FS-Cache: Generic filesystem caching facility
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/15/102

The patches are available from:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/cachefs/
There's a patch-list.txt file in there with the patch descriptions and patch
names in order as well.
Also in there is dump-cachefs.c which can be used to peer into the depths of a
block device that has had cachefs mounted on it to see what's what.
