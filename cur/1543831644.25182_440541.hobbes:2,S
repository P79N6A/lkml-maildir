Of course.  I don't care which trade-offs you prefer to maintain as long
as the driver stops yelling at me as the machine boots.  That patch was
what Arjan suggested as the simplest.
Also, while looking at this I saw that the locks are being
re-initialized from mthca_modify_qp().  Is that just a side-effect of
relying on mthca_wq_init() to reset the non-lock members?  If you're
concerned about microoptimization it seems like this could be avoided.
