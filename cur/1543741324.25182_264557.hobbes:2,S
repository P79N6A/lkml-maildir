Yes, they do as much as they can.  Kbuild cd's to the objtree before doing 
anything. Specifying $(objtree) is not needed. Specifying $(obj) probably 
does not even work in the ARCH Makefile.
That said, O=<whatever> is highly broken; it seems that Gerd Knorr was able to 
build the tree with O=, but actually some files are still created in the 
source tree, while they should not. This is a problem and would require 
various changes.
