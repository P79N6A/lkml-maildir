I'll duck the discussion that followed your post as to whether some
sort of error or null return would be better than killing something.
If it is the case that some code path leads to the OOM killer, then
I don't agree that memory restrictions such as cpuset constraints
should mean we avoid the OOM killer.
I've already changed the OOM killer to only go after tasks in or
overlapping with the same cpuset.
static struct task_struct *select_bad_process(unsigned long *ppoints)
{
	...
	do_each_thread(g, p) {
		...
		/* If p's nodes don't overlap ours, it won't help to kill p. */
		if (!cpuset_excl_nodes_overlap(p))
			continue;
                                                    
I am guessing (you don't say) that your concern is that it seems
unfair for some app in some small cpuset to be able to trigger the
system-wide OOM killer.  The basic problem that this caused, that
of killing unrelated processes in entirely non-overlapping cpusets,
which was of no use in reducing the memory stress in the faulting
cpuset, is no longer a problem.
