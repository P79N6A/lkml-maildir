I have been following this discussion for the last week or so, and
what I haven't been able to figure out is what the hell is the big
deal with TiVO doing whatever they want to with their stupid design.
They made a design, they build a machine, they sell it as is, and
provide source code for GPL'ed software... what's your problem?
In order to play backuped games in, say, a PS2 I need to modify it's
hardware. Gut it up, solder some cables to a chip that will bypass the
signature key reading in the CD/DVDs. It's legal to mod it (it's my
hardware, I paid for it) although it voids my warranty. It's also
legal to copy the games (where I live) if I own the original, but
we're no talking about DMR here. Not exactly
Now, I'm sure some alike modification can be made to "help" TiVO
bypassing the signature key check... and I'm sure it's legal. Again,
what is your problem?
Linus said it already, but TiVO has seen himself FORCED to protect its
software for the very same reason Microsoft had to uncanningly
overhead EVERYTHING in Vista: the Media (Fox, Universal, Etcetera)
companies forced them too. But this is just a comment.. the thing is
that I really can't see the problem
