Well, in keyboard.c, handle_scancode, after
	if (!kbd_translate(scancode, &keycode, raw_mode))
	    return;
keycodes are the same for up and down.  Probably later on the up/down
bit gets set.  Anyway, id really doesn't matter, I tried with
keycodes, but many programs use kbd RAW mode therefore keycode
filtering (as opposed to scancode filtering) is really useless
(e.g. X).

Ok, we can change it to 200 ms in order to be below any PC kbd I
know.

Strange, it shouldn't...  It enforces only the kbd delay, not the
repeat rate...  Does it affect your kbd rate????

Well, though I consider myself a quick typist, I seldom think at smth
else while I type and my fingers are a bit lazier - resting a bit more 
on the keys - therefore I might not release a key after 100ms - also I 
am very accustomed with the 250ms delay, I know exactly when to
release a key in this time frame so it doesn't repeat.  If we put 100
ms (I tried) sometimes I get duplicates (catching one glitch after
100ms, probably releasing the key at 110 ms or smth...).

Of course, I agree that fast key repeat is important, but is 250 ms
too long for you as kbd delay?  Because it doesn't affect the kbd
rate, IMHO...  Also, maybe we should make this configurable, so it
does get compiled in only for those who care - and maybe the delay
also configurable - I don't know enough about kernel configuration -
maybe smbd can help?
