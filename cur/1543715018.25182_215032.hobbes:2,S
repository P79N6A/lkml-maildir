Of course you are right. However, the main purpose of posting my 
patches was _not_ to get them into the mainline kernel but 
to get feedback regarding the technical possibility of using the driver 
without the firmware. I got some private mails confirming that the 
patched driver works for different controllers without the firmware.
While looking at the tg3.c sources I found the attached problem.
