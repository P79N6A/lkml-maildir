Hmm, they already need linux/init.h for module_init() and
module_exit().  Of course the backwards compat MODULE_PARM must not
require an extra include (and it doesn't, does it?).
I guess this leads to the bigger "what are the rules for new header
files?" question, which I'm not prepared to try to answer.
