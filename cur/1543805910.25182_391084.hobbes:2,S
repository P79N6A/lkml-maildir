What about the first paragraph of what I wrote? You are going to want to 
keep often-used keys around somehow, proxy certificates is not a 
solution for your own use of your personal keys and with the exception 
of hardware solutions such as smart cards, the keys will be safer in the 
kernel than in a user-space daemon...
Further, the mpi and dsa code can also be used for supporting signed 
modules and binaries...the "store dsa-keys in kernel" part adds 376 
lines of code (counted with wc so comments and includes etc are also 
counted)...
