Nothing much to add - it's a pretty stock install of (I think) UP1.1 (may
have been 1.1.9, but I don't think so).
Rather than init, it was, of course, ld-linux.so.2 which couldn't resolve
the symbol - the symbol was sometimes blank, sometimes not, but often it
looked like a mangled library symbol - 'memcp' and similar things appeared
a few times..
