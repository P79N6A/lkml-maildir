For a 32-way system fastwalk will perform badly from dcache_lock point of 
view, basically due to increased lock hold time. dcache_rcu-12 should reduce
dcache_lock contention and hold time. The patch uses RCU infrastructer patch and
read_barrier_depends patch. The patches are available in Read-Copy-Update
section on lse site at
