I've rewritten your rewrite again 8)
This patch actually implements module_param in sysfs for modules.  You
can see my tests in crypto_null().
What's missing is inbuilt modules.  I think /sys/modules/ne2k/debug
should exist whether ne2k is built-in or modular, for example.  Since
the only thing we have is a kparam with "ne2k.debug" as its name, there
will have to be some kludgery here, but we can end up with something OK.
Cheers,
Rusty.
