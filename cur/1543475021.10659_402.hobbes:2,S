I rewrote the patch-kernel script to accept patch filenames from the
command line.  This is helpful with patches that don't follow the normal
increment (ie, *-acX, *-preX, etc.)  Please test it before I send it to
Linus.
Note:  I changed the parameters so you now need to put -s before the
kernel source dir and -p before the patch dir.
