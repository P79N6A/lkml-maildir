They have a problem that requires I backup everything first before setting up
the disks.  That will require enormous time (to back up 203GB onto CDs) or
money (buy a big tape backup system).

Yes, I bought Promise fasttrack100 TX@ (PDC20270), Adaptek 1200A (HPT370A
chipset), Iwill (HPT368 chipset), HighPoint Rocket 133 (HPT302 chip: didn't
work at all), and PDC20276 built onto the Asus P4B533-E motherboard, as well
as the CMD648 (from memory), CMD649, and the SiliconImage 680 that I am
currently stuck with as the best of the bunch.
Do you think there is there any chipset available that I can use native IDE
on so I can use the software RAID on Linux?

Yes; if only I could use it without a massive backup and restore!
Thank you Mike.
