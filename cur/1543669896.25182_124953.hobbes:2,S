Topic drift...
After asking around internally, it sounds like we should not be doing a
video re-POST on wakeup. Windows only used to in order to workaround
buggy video drivers, according to what I've heard.
Ben obviously PPC is ahead of the pack on this stuff (congrats) but I
did just want to put forward the idea that when we're all done with this
stuff on all archs, we will hopefully not be regularly re-POSTing the
video bios.
