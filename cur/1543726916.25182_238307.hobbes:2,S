I have an nforce2 motherboard also (Asus A7N8X Deluxe).  And I'm
having issues as well, like the parent poster I had to previously
revert bk-usb.patch when using mm kernels.  Now the problem persists
in vanilla 2.6.8-rc2.  Specifically my problem is that Starting Cups
hangs during bootup.  I removed USB support and it booted fine, but I
can't live without USB, keyboard, mouse, and external hard drive are
all USB.  Below is my config file hopefully it will help.
