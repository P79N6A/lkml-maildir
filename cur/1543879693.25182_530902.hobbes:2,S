Obviously I don't know how Chris created his conglomerated repo, but I 
just made one of my own, and it has all the tags I would expect in it ... 
so it's not an inherent git problem (or not in 1.5.1.1 anyway).
I guess that Chris created his in such a way that the automated tag 
following code didn't trigger? (Or maybe used a really old git?)
(Mine's at 
http://git.q42.co.uk/w/stable.git
 if anyone is interested 
enough to want to look at it ...)
It only took me 4 commands to create too (ok, so three of them were bash 
for loops ... and I did do a little bit more to tidy up), I do enjoy using 
flexible tools :D.
