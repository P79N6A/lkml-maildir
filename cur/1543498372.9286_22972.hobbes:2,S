If i am understanding the NFS "problem" correctly it is as follows.
1. server is booted, drive is given a dynamic major/minor number
2. nfs server gives this out as part of a file handle
3. server is rebooted gets another dynamic major/minor number (not the
same one)
4. client then attemps to use the old file handle to access the file
<BOOM>
The fix for this as I seee it is that the nfs code should be modified to
not use the major/minor number but have some other method of storing the
info. As a reminder the file handle for nfs is supposed to be opaque, that
is it only has meaning for the server, the client cannot assume anything
about how it is structured.
Of course I may have missed the point of the argument, if so I know
someone will tell me :-)
