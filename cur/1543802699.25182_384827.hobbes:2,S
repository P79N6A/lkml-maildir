Nope tried every thing, shutting down the ntp server, changing the Ntp 
server, any thing I do it still will hang intermittently. And if the 
problem is because of the Ntp why should it hang only on 2.6 not 2.4 
kernels ?
And the point is that when it reaches that stage all the commands seem 
to execute ultra slow.
Any help for diagnosing the problem is most welcome.
Thanks,
Chaitanya
