Forgive me please if this is off topic, but has anyone here had any sucuess
getting information out of vendors that would enable you to write a device
driver?  The vendor I'm having the most trouble with is Trident Micro.  Does
anyone know the magic person/email address for said person to get technical
reference information on the sound cards they don't make anymore?
