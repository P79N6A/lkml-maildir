No, VFAT and NTFS use an 8-bit encoding, and I think its only NTFS5 that is 
forced to only use UTF-8 as the encoding (vfat can use any 8-bit encoding, 
and NTFS4 afaik can as well, and I don't think NTFS5 uses UTF-16 internally),
Forcing people to use unicode isn't a bad thing btw, especially since it is a 
culture agnostic encoding that can represent wide characters (eg. from Asian 
languages) in a uniform manner*, and allowing to use multiple languages (eg. 
Chinese and Japanese) at once without needing to switch encodings.
This also means it fixes the 'bug' where you have multiple encodings for the 
same language (ie. JIS, SJIS, and EUC_JP; similarly, simplified Chinese has 5 
popular encoding methods, and traditional Chinese as three), which allows 
easier sharing of data between users without needing to muck with encoding.
* Unicode can do so in UTF-8 as well as UTF-16 to describe the entire 20-bit 
space.
