I like that approach, if you really think it's a good idea to have a
separate structure for the subset needed for IO.  I'm not clear why it'd be
a bad idea to have one structure and the IO subsystem would only use the
parts it cares about, but you've clearly thought about it more than I have,
so I'll take your word for it.
I looked through your patches.  It looks like you're on the right track,
generally.  I am a little concerned about some of the current_get*/set*
functions.  I'm not entirely convinced there aren't race conditions in
them, but I need to think harder on it.
