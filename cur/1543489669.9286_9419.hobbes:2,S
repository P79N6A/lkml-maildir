Running gdb with a debug linked version of xawtv produces the following
backtrace after the segfault.

Looking at the code in question
  static int
  grab_queue(struct video_mmap *gb)
  {
    if (debug > 1)
    fprintf(stderr,"g%d",gb->frame);
  #if 1
    /* FIXME */
    memset(map + gb_buffers.offsets[gb->frame],0,
       gb_buffers.size/gb_buffers.frames);
  #endif
Looks like the fault runs deep, and people know about it. Commenting
out the code (#if 0) lets you get the app up, but it segfaults later
in another file, another memset, when trying to change channels.
This worked fine with 2.2.2-ac7, failed with 2.2.3-ac1. So something
in the kernel has changed to cause the fault, but that comment seems
to suggest its not the kernel actually at fault here.
