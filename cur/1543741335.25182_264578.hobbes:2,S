Unfortunately this won't be OK either. 2.6.10-rc1 has a lot of i2c
changes, including a number of things your patch attempts to fix (macro
abuse reported by Mark Hoffman). So it won't apply to Greg's tree.
Please provide your patch against 2.6.10-rc1. Sorry that you always seem
to provide your patch against the not-really-last tree ;)
