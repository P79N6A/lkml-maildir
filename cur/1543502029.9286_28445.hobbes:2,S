The new driver times out repeatedly with my on-board (Tyan 1696DLUA)
7895 controller. It recognizes my narrow AIWA TD-8001 on Channel A id 6
and then goes into infinite host 1 ch 0 SCSI bus resets. The tape drive
is the only thing on Channel A... my 2 Wide Hard Drives are on Channel
B. Unfortunately I don't have time at the moment to unplug the tape
drive to see if it behaves exactly like it did before (it worked when I
did so before).
I did try forcing the tape drive negotiation to narrow without it
helping anyway.
