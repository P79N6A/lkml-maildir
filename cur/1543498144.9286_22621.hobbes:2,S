Hmm..  There are edge conditions where it helps to have a bit of swap
even if you're not going to need a lot of it.  Just enough to swap out
stuff that you really don't need, in order to make room for other stuff. 
I certainly always advocate having some swap-space: it makes the "uhhuh,
I have too little memory" case degrade much more gracefully..
