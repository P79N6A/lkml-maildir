Hi,
the subject I struggled over this thing is still my not working
MO-drive. I sat down to extensivly test the conditions when and how my
Optical behaves when mounting it. 
As said earlier this is an older Optical drive with SCSI revision: 01 CCS
I booted with media inserted.
Then I mounted the device via 'hand' means: mount /dev/sdc <mountpoint>
and NOT mount <mountpoint> which is written in fstab. 
Ok, behaves ok. 
Now umounting the drive and ejecting it.
Mount an empty drive (no cartridge in) with mount /dev/sdc <mountpoint>
gives a few errors, ok.
Umount the empty drive.
gives a few errors, same as above, ok.
Mount an empty drive with mount /dev/sdc <mountpoint>
gives a few more errors.
Umount the empty drive.
umount: /dev/sdc: not found, ok.
Now I change the side of the cartridge and do the same again.
Doing so I get the correct content listed from Bside.
In short I can see my A and Bside of the MO-media when I go through a
uninserted media step. A progress for me then before I did the same with
the following result:
Scenario same as above EXCEPT I mount via mount <mountpoint> (/mnt/Aopto).
My entry in fstab: /dev/sdc	/mnt/Aopto	ext2	noauto	0	0
Now I mounted the device via mount <mountpoint>
Ok, behaves ok. 
Now umounting the drive and ejecting it.
Mount an empty drive (no cartridge in) with mount /dev/sdc <mountpoint>
gives a few errors, ok.
Umount the empty drive.
gives a few errors, same as above, ok.
Mount an empty drive with mount /dev/sdc <mountpoint>
gives a few more errors.
but different than above in first scenario.
unmount /mnt/Aopto
umount: /mnt/Aopto/: not mounted
Now I change the side of the cartridge and do the same again.
Doing so I get the WRONG content listed from Bside. The tree is still
the same as on the Aside. 
And here it stops. The only chance to get the Bside was a reboot with 
Bside inserted at boottime.
Now I can save this step :-)
My question: why this behavior when working with fstab entries???
A detailed log of the procedures I did is available..
Thanks for any hint
Andreas
