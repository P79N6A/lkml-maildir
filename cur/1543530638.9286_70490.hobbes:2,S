So they can impliment the above mentioned propritary features.
It's a tough sell when you've got a $100 part which in a sane world would
be a <$5 part built-in the motherboard. :)
Perhaps once Linux's networking stack makes it easier to do neat things
like zero copy, and hardware checksumming type things the vendors will
fell less compelled to produce such drivers.
Further, if Linus hadn't made that stupid exception to the GPL, then we'd
be able to include the vendor driver (in the rare case that it's actually
better then the openly made one).
