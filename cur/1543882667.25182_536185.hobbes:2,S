I've been playing with libata on a few machines and I found that this machine
(An old Dell Dimension L866r) gives me this when it loads and does not give me
access to the cdrom.  This is the only machine that I've tested that I know
for a fact cannot do DMA on the cdrom.  I searched and noticed a similar
problem with 2.6.19-rc versions but I'm not sure if it's the same problem.
dmesg output:
