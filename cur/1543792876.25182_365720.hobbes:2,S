I believe the latter half of those comments (timeouts) should
be left in the IDE layer (somewhere), as a note to current/future
maintainers about something that does need fixing eventually.
Something like this:
/*
  * FIXME:  Someday we ought to parameterize IDE timeouts to use
  * much smaller values when dealing with flash memory cards.
  * For example, these devices never require more than a second
  * (much less, actually) for "spin-up", compared with a limit
  * of 31 seconds for mechanical ATA drives.  This would speed up
  * error recovery for these popular devices, especially in embedded work
