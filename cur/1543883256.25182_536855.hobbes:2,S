It didn't come across this way, sorry, but I didn't ask a priori to be
persuaded, but rather because I thought your argument (at the wiki site)
could be enhanced by pointing out the concrete applications of the
facility.  When I visited the page, it only explained how the facility
works, not what the end-use is.

(Although if a certain number of kernel components is inappropriately
labeled, the facility becomes useless of course.)

You said "it's not just presentational markup", I said "it is". :-)

I see a discussion on OBSOLETE vs. BROKEN there, which even ended in a
consensus, but I do not see an explicit discussion on OBSOLETE vs.
DEPRECATED.  The only definition of DEPRECATED I see there is yours, and
as it is worded, it is largely overlapping with the definition of
OBSOLETE (which, as it is laid down in that thread, is mostly yours too)
--- but it is not actually conflicting with it.
Note, another classification system can be found in
Documentation/ABI/README.  That one also features the category
"obsolete", but does not include a category "deprecated".  This is
beneficial because it doesn't leave room for disagreeing interpretations
like ours, nor for any overlap in the definitions like in those at the
end of the thread you referenced.
