No, bogomip calculation is too expensive to do during a running kernel.  At
boot time it doesn't matter one whit what it costs.

No, that's it exactly.  Some questions:
Given:
If we know the frequencies the amchine runs at in each mode, it's no big
deal to find the new bogomips.
Then:
Is that something we can find quicker than a full on bogo mips calc?  How?
Would laptops need a bogomips.conf file in their /etc directory, or do APM
and what not have an API that can tell us that on most systems that change
clock speed?  Or is there a super fast and dirty check we can do to "guess"
from a group of logical speeds which one we're running. 
If none of those work, could we do a super quick and dirty compute to guess
what speed we're going?  (I.e. do most of these systmes just shut down the
front side bus, or only the CPU side of it by changing the multiplier?
How expensive is a bogomips calc anyway?
