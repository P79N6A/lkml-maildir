On the other hand, we could handle it in the compat code alone and leave
the rest as-is.
/* PPC32 aligns this at 64bit, IA32 packs it */
struct raw1394_cycle_timer32 {
	__u32 cycle_timer;
	__u64 local_time;
}
#if defined(CONFIG_X86_64) || defined(CONFIG_IA64)
__attribute__((packed))
#endif
;

should be put into practice though.
