It is completely the wrong thing for a the root_user to span multiple
namespaces as you describe.  It is important for uid 0 in other namespaces
to not have the privileges of the root_user.  That is half the point.
Too many files in sysfs and proc don't require caps but instead simply
limit things to uid 0.  Having a separate uid 0 in the different namespaces
instantly makes all of these files inaccessible, and keeps processes from
doing something bad.
To a filesystem a uid does not share a uid namespace with the only things
that should be accessible are those things that are readable/writeable
by everyone.   Unless the filesystem has provisions for storing multiple
uid namespaces not files should be able to be created.  Think NFS root
squash.

This patch looks extremly incomplete.
Every comparison of a user id needs to compare the tuple
(user namespace, user id) or it needs to compare struct users.
Ever comparison of a group id needs to compare the tuple
(user namespace, group id) or it needs to compare struct users.
I think the key infrastructure needs to be looked at here as well.
There needs to be a user namespace association for mounted filesystems.
We need a discussion about how we handle map users from one user
namespace to another, because without some form of mapping so many
things become inaccessible that the system is almost useless.
I believe some of the key infrastructure which is roughly kerberos
authentication tokens could be used for this purpose.
A user namespace is a big thing.  What I see here doesn't even
seem to scratch the surface.
