It's just as bad, probably worse! You trap on an invalid op-code. The
trap-handler checks the op-code and if it's emulated, it emulates it
and returns to the executing task. This takes many instruction cycles,
certainly more than `if(cmov) doit; else do_something_else;` --which,
itself, takes many more instruction cycles than cmov is supposed to
reduce. It's a no-win situation. The only way to win is a compile-time
choice. This means customizing for your CPU IFF it has the cmov
instruction.
