Count me in. I want to make it work.
It's not a Prism II, it says Prism I. It is a D-Link DWL-520 PCI card.
Does that matter?
By the way, I wouldn't want to admit it, but it works much better under
Win98 (ick). It cycles between "Associated: (mac addr)" and "Scanning..."
for _several minutes_ before giving up. And ping is working all this time.
Under Linux, average time before failure is 20 sec :(
I presume card is considering AP to be too weak and try to find a better
one. There isn't any. How can I disable this reassociation or lower
reassociation threshold?
At the very least, how can I see whether it is associated or scanning?
Pointers to 802.1b docs? (I am googling in parallel...)
Meanwhile will download and look into HostAP.
