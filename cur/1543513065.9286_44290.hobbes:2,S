The sig11 is a common trouble in overclocked processors. In a
i486DX4-100 overclocked to 125, i've putted another cooler (actually, a
power module fan) to stop the error. Now i got a nice overclocked
machine running 2.2.12 for +- 3 weeks.
Other common trouble is a *too fast* bios' options. Try to reduce read
and/or write wait times.
More info on Sig11 at Sig11 web page (( Please Please Please i've lost
the bookmark :p anyone who knows please please send it )).
See Ya.
