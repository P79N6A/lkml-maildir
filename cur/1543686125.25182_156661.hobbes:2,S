No.  It just means that it's possible to produce artificial loads that 
break things, and since those artificial loads won't be encountered in 
typical usage, they should not be optimized for.
Mind you, we prefer that the worst case "record you cannot play" doesn't 
have TOO much impact, because we don't want people writing DoS programs 
which exploit those artificial cases.
