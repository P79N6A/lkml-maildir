Subject: patch 2 / 3: deselect dst and dst-ca modules if they aren't needed
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi folks,
although this patch is fine and necessary it has been blocked and ignored for months by the following so-called "maintainers"
who are a tall order, a shame and a mismatch for the whole linux community:
a. Manuel Abraham <abraham.manu@gmail.com>
b. Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@infradead.org>
I vote for excluding Manuel Abraham from maintainership as we all need communicatable, accurate and reliable maintainers, no mismatches!
within the current kernel concept you are forced to compile the TwinHan dst and dst-ca modules as a regular case which is absolute nonsense.
With this patch you optimize RAM usage for all bt8xx DVB-S abd DVB-T cards with the following known exceptions:
1. Pinnacle PCTV Sat with CI extension
2. TwinHan DST and clones
3. TwinHan DST with CA slot
4. Chaintech DST-1000
5. DNTV Live !
Please sign-off or ack this only in connection with the bt8xx documentation fix (i. e. patch 1 / 3).
Written, tested with a Pinnacle PCTV Sat without CI extension and:
