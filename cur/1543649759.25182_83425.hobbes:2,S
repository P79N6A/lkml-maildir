Subject: 2.5.44 serial driver bug with asus pr-dls m/b

I can't get the serial port driver to work from with the stock linux 
kernel 2.5.44 and an asus pr-dls dual xeon m/b.
It doesn't seem to detect the uart of tts/0 at all, although it finds 
tts/1 if I enable it in the bios (there isn't a DB9 for tts/1 on the 
rear plate so I can't actually try it)
If I
    setserial /dev/tts/0 uart 16550A
which seems happy, it still doesn't work.
dmesg says...(Note this is tts/1 it sees)
Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ IRQ sharing disabled
tts/%d1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A
Bios sends POST text down serial fine, so I know the hardwares OK
PS Ultimate aim is to get serial console stuff working
Any suggestions?
