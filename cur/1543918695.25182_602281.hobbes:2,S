I vaguely remembered something called orasim, so I went looking for it.
I found 
http://oss.oracle.com/~wcoekaer/orasim/
 which is dated from
2004, and I found 
http://oss.oracle.com/projects/orasimjobfiles/
 which
seems to be a stillborn project.  Is there anything else I should know
about orasim?  ;-)
