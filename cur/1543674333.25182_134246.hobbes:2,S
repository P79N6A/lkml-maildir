This sounds reasonable. The people who shipped that already to
customers have so heavily patched kernels, that this simple patch
for the old sys_futex shouldn't really matter.
But cluttering the kernel with an API/ABI that was born in the
same development cycle, where it has been obsoleted sounds not
worth the bytes it consumes. And so we have a syscall slot
available for the next development cycle.
Or did anybody promise that this was final already? Usally this
promise comes with x.even.y not with x.odd.y .
