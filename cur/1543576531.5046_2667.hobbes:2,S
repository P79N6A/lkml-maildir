you don't mention which kernel you are using, but for some time now
ext2fs has been able to handle large files (>2GB) -- and I suspect dd
created such a beast for you
rm probably stat'd the file beforing removing it -- and failed,
because it's either old or uses and old library (which isn't LFS
aware)

    For grins, I did `dd if=/dev/zero of=testfile bs=1024 count=4000000` 
    
    Obviously, with the limits of ext2, this isn't allowed, however, dd continued
    marrily on its way, tho it spouted an error...
    
    I cancelled the dd and went to remove the file, though the following occured:
    root@obfuscated:/home/ftp# rm testfile
    rm: cannot remove `testfile': Value too large for defined data type     
    
    'ls' complains about the same.  I ran e2fsck -f /dev/hde6 (the partition of
    /home) and it didn't 'find' the problem.
    
    How do I remove this file and reclaim the HDD space?
    
    Thanks,
