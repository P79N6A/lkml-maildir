I am not aware of non-Intel FWHs supporting the same RNG interface.

If you're worried about people thinking their box being reported to have no
FWH when it does, then just make the message say so (i.e. add 82802 or
alike).
># Do you think that a "FWH not detected" message is noisy?
No, I think it helps understanding why there's no RNG device in the system.
