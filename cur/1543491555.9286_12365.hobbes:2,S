Hi,
I remember that there was a question for going around the buffer/cache of filesystem in linux a few days ago - I shared the discussion.
Advice was given to use raw-devices to have a constant datastream without buffering/caching - is there any possibility to decrease the cache or to switch it off without using raw-devices?
I am running kernel 2.0.36 and was told that there is no possibility of using raw-devices so far except on kernelversions above 2.1.131.
