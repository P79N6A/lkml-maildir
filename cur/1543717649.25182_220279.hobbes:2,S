You said  2.6.6-rc3-mm2 gives you these strange
messages, but how does 2.6.6-mm2 behave?
> ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: suspend D0 --> D3
> ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: No PM capability
2.6.6-mm2 won't give that message pair.  The EHCI
suspend/resume should work better though.
> uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.2: suspend D4 --> D3
> uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.2: suspend_hc
> uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: suspend D4 --> D3
> uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.1: suspend_hc
> uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.0: suspend D4 --> D3
> uhci_hcd 0000:00:1d.0: suspend_hc
Those messages are a bit strange.  If it still
misbehaves in 2.6.6-mm2, please send "lspci -vv"
info for these USB controllers.  (Preferably
to linux-usb-devel, where it's easier to see.)

> ehci_hcd 0000:00:1d.7: can't resume, not suspended!
Again, 2.6.6-mm2 shouldn't do that.
