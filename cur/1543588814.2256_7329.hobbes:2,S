Someone else here traced the process flags of a FP-intensive program
on a machine before and after it is put in the faulty FPU state.  He
periodically sampled /proc/pid/stat while the program was running.
He found that PF_USEDFPU was always set before the machine was broken.
After he found that it was set about 70% of the time.
