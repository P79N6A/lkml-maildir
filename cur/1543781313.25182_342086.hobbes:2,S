I think the big problem with this idea is the huge memory regions that
InfiniBand applications are dealing with. If the application forks (or
uses system()), you are going to copy a huge chunk of data (most
likely swapping since the application memory footprint is probably
already tuned to consume the available physical memory). And the copy
is really for nothing since in most (or at least many) cases the child
is just going to exec anyway.
