Nobody seems to be intrested in fixing this bug?
Anyway, I was looking at some statistics of the box, which I
think might be related to this problem.
netstat -s shows this under TCP:
Tcp:
    11681 active connections openings
    0 passive connection openings
    84689 failed connection attempts
    0 connection resets received
    94 connections established
    10963047 segments received
    11476087 segments send out
    392891 segments retransmited
    772 bad segments received.
    24083 resets sent
It seems it has to retransmit 3.4% of the TCP segments, which is
rather high.
The box is just up for 10 days, this means it has to retransmit
about .45 segments / second, and the rate seems to be going up.
I hope this helps.
If there is anything else I can do, please ask.
Kurt
