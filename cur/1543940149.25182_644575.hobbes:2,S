This is a bit tricky b/c this goes to the drivers/firmware and also depends on 
the kobject changes in Greg KH tree. But I should have included Mike on the 
CC which I keep on forgetting <sigh>.

Done. This repost:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/28/304
has the details.

Yes.

Fixed. The function now is in include/linux/iscsi_ibft.h

Uhh, I didn't add that.

The data structure does not change when the machine has booted up. The iBFT is 
a read-only structure and there are no known mechanism to write to it via the 
iBFT structure (or even BIOS up-calls). You have to use custom-vendor 
applications to flash the BIOS with the new iBFT structure. Hence no need for 
locking at this stage - when the specs becomes more advance I will add them 
if they are required.

There is no reading of data from the user-land. All of it is just outputing to 
the /sysfs entries from reading the data in the iBFT structure which the BIOS 
created.

Done. Took out the #define.

FIEF, or FEUD. In its origin, a fief was a district of country allotted to 
one of the chiefs who invaded the Roman empire, as a stipend or reward.

Originally I had it to be x86-specific but was told that I should make it all 
platforms since the IBFT is platform independent. Somebody can very well 
insert a NIC with IBFT on a IA64 machine or PPC.

Ok. Fixed it.
