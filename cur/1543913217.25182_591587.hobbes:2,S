Linus, please pull the latest scheduler git tree from:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mingo/linux-2.6-sched.git
8 changes: 6 fixes and 2 preparatory cleanups to one of the fixes. The 
most serious fix is the one from Suresh Siddha - we still under-balanced 
tasks on multi-core systems - this should be the only user-noticeable 
fix. Plus there are 2 debug-only fixes, one build warning fix, one fix 
affecting the granularity of reniced tasks (it was inconsistent with the 
sched_latency goal) and a reniced-tasks granularity code fix that did 
not appear to have visible effects (that anyone noticed) but is correct 
and simple nevertheless.
