The following message ("This sound card may not...") appears when my via
audio driver initializes.  How can I get rid of it?
Regards,

This sound card may not be fully Sound Blaster Pro compatible.
In many cases there is another way to configure OSS so that
it works properly with OSS (for example in 16 bit mode).
Please ignore this message if you _really_ have a SB Pro.
