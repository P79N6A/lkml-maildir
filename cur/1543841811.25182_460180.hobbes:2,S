It's not a question of me being satisfied or embarrassed.  The only 
question is what works for all cases.
My guess is that we need more complex logic to detect which devices are 
truly on-board.
Unfortunately for us, PCI cards with VIA SATA or VIA ethernet exist, so 
we cannot continue the current scheme of device ID enumeration either.
