It found sys, and then the second iteration in in xlate_proc_name it failed
to find net because the de->subdir for sys/net wasn't set.

Wasn't my code originally - I think the original author thought that since
all the *other* config stuff for ipv4 was down under /proc/sys/net/ipv4, this
one should be as well because that's where sysadmins would look for it, and
wasn't thinking so much about whether it was a sysctl or not.

It's easy enough to move the entry under /proc/net or someplace instead.
What's the current advice on what kernel interface to use for this scenario:
In userspace, we do something like this:
(while read foo; do echo $foo > /proc/my_file; done) < /etc/bunch_of_lines
and we want to catch, parse, and save each line as it enters the kernel, and
we end up with several dozen entries saved.
If we do a 'cat /proc/my_file', we iterate across the list of saved lines
and dump them all out.
