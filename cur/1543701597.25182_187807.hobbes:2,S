My understanding was that the syscall always only supports si_int/si_ptr.
Only the kernel can pass other values.  The original idea was to
detect if the code comes from user space, the convert si_int/si_ptr,
otherwise do the kernel conversion.
More for compatibility the emulation layer has been copying the
rest of the 128byte siginfo too, but it didn't do any alignment
adjustment. So if somebody passes some arbitary structure
in there from user space it will likely only work if he sends
it to another 32bit or another 64bit process. Otherwise the alignment
will be messed up. There is nothing that can be done about them.

Basically it was supposed to be: 
any signal queuing system calls: 
	reject any codes that can be generated by the kernel
conversion:
	if (code generated by the kernel)
		do appropiate conversion
	else
		fix si_int/si_ptr alignment and copy the rest

If glibc uses other values than si_int/si_ptr for non kernel generated
signals it is IMHO broken.

I think it is reasonable to just not support this in emulation. We should actually
reject these codes in sigqueueinfo when comming from user space.
