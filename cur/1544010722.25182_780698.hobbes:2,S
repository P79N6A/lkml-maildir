Hello,
I'm sorry if it is not the best place to ask, but I haven't find any answer.
I am currently developing a software that needs approx 60k timers. I
currently use timer_create and all the relative functions to manage timers.
I've noticed that after having created 16039 timers I always get an oops
from the kernel, which are always of the same kind:
Dec 15 15:20:00 evolution kernel: [601680.417064] BUG: unable to handle
kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000040 .
I tried looking at kernel/posix-timers.c and I discovered that posix
timers are kept in slab memory. By monitoring the my program I can see
that in /proc/slabinfo the number of timers increases till 16039, when I
get the oops and no more timers are created.
In /prob/slabinfo I have
posix_timers_cache 0 0 192 20 1 : tunables 120 60  8 : slabdata 0 0 0
If I try to increase tunables to 2400 120 16 the maximum number of posix
timers that I can create does not change.
How can I tune the kernel so that it supports 60k or more timers?
Thank for your help,
Ottavio
