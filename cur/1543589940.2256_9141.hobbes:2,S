You can't be serious.  You invite the poor user to sit through an
indefinite, unpredictable, and *large* number of mutation passes
hoping the stupid search will trip over a solution?  That's a far worse
waste of their time than telling them to correct by hand in the
exceedingly rare cases that would be necessary, in my considered
opinion.
A more egregious case of using a bazooka to swat a fly I've seldom seen.
Can we restore some sense of *proportion* here?

Rifles, muskets, long-bows and hand-grenades are inherently democratic
weapons.  A complex weapon makes the strong stronger, while a simple
weapon -- so long as there is no answer to it -- gives claws to the
weak.
