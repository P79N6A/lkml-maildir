I'm sure the idea has been raised before, but given the above
paragraph I can't resist poking my nose into where it doesn't really
belong:
Would it perhaps make sense to use one of these last 'free' fields
as a pointer to an 'inode entension'?
If you still want ext2fs to be able to accommodate new projects and
ideas, then it seems that being able to extend the inode is a
desirable feature, but perhaps this overlaps with the apparent plans
for adding resource forks?
Cheers,
