Ah, but it could.  If you had more than one IDE controller (which is
even possible on laptops; the Fujitsu P7120 is one that I'm familiar
with that has more than one), the initialisation order *of the
controllers* would change which was hda and which was hde.

It's not something anyone particularly set out to do, it's just how
it worked out.  It was justified by saying "ok, this goes from a 99%
solution to a 96% solution, but there's 100% solution called uuids".
I don't particularly agree with this line of argumentation, but it did
hold sway.
