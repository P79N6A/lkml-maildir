Well, I realize that it has been on bugtraq, but does that make it a real 
concern? I'll make the tristate a boolean, but has anybody half-way sane 
ever _done_ what is described by the bugtraq posting? IOW, it looks pretty 
much like a made-up example, also known as a "don't do that then" kind of 
buglet ;)
