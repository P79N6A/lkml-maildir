EFBIG is very different in several ways. To start with the get_block code
doesnt have enough information to correctly implement the SUS specification
rules.
The generic cases can be handled in generic code. They cannot cleanly be
handled by copying that code into every file system. Ditto with truncate.
Since the VFS can handle them nicely the VFS should handle them.
