If BIOS is often correct: Is it possible to read these values and compare
them to the values linux calculates? If both match: OK, continue. If they
are different: Either BIOS or linux is wrong, print a warning and disable
DMA (or go to some other kind of 'safe mode').
Just an idea, I don't know anything about chipsets and IDE timings ;-)
