Somewhere back around 2.2.15 (or so) a change was made that has the smp
cpu start up code removing the start up task from the run list.  I think
you will find the del_from_runqueue() is only used in this case.  It
could have been done in init_idle() in sched.c (in fact the code is
there) but it is also done prior to this call.  Sigh...
