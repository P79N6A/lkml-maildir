Hello,
maybe im on the wrong, i dont really know if i can find help here.
i compiled the 2.6.12-rc4, everything works fine, and i tried ide-scsi
module to get better dvd burning speed.
it works, i get 5x transfer, but once its finished, the dvd burner is
no longer recognized and doesnt want to eject, i have to reboot to get
it work again.
without ide-scsi, i only have a 1x burning speed and the dvd can eject
and burn another one without pb.
