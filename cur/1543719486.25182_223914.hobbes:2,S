Well, my argument is that we only have immediate need for raw access to 
PC-style AUX ports because of wide variety of connected devices. Serial
ports have other historical means of accessing them, busmice ports have
well known devices attached.
Once we have sysfs integration in place I imagine we will be able to
implement dynamic binding of serio drivers and ports, atkbd and psmouse
being default ones and user will be able to rebind a specific port to
let's say serio-raw or some other driver that does not have automatic
hardware detection yet.
But in the meantime marking several ports raw will allow most of the users
use old means of communicating with their pointing devices without too
much effort.
