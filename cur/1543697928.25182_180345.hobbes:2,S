Have you already tried (as a module, *not* builtin) the SpeedStep
clockmod driver (CONFIG_X86_P4_CLOCKMOD=M) or, if your Southbridge is an
ICH[234], the ICH driver (CONFIG_X86_SPEEDSTEP_ICH=M)?
You might then always have access to the maximum speed, and reduce
according to need of usage to something lower.
