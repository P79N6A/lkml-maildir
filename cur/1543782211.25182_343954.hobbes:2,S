Interesting ! At least it does not seem to be present in the
epoll-2.4.24-0.20 I have right here, and although the code changed
significantly in 2.6, it does not seem to contain it either. But I
don't even see how to merge this into 2.6. You should ask Davide,
he knows this code better than anyone else, and could tell us if
this patch was simply lost or is unneeded.
Regards,
Willy
