Fengguang, congratulations, I can confirm that your patch fixed the bug! With 
previous kernels the bug showed up after each reboot. Now, when booting the 
patched kernel everything is fine and there is no longer any suspicious 
iowait!
Do you have an idea why this problem appeared in 2.6.24? Did somebody change 
the ext2 code or is it related to the changes in the scheduler?
regards,
Jörg
