| Why is it appropriate to register the MCA bus type when there is no
| MCA bus present?
Mostly because it was selected with CONFIG_MCA=y.
Another option (I think, need to test) is to check !MCA_bus
in drivers/mca/mca-legacy.c::find_mca_adapter(), so that
mca_bus_type isn't used when it shouldn't be.
Do you prefer that approach?
