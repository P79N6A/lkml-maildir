Subject: Re: [PATCH][IPMI] Fix mem leak in try_init_dmi() code

Indeed this is a problem, please merge.  This is only called at init
time and only happens if the BIOS screws something up, so the leak is
slight and it is probably not worth sending to 2.6.22.x.  The driver
would not initialize the interface in the case, and I have no reports
of this happening.  I have booted and run tests on a system with this
patch.  Note that the original patch was munged by the mailer, here's
a new one.
If we ever hit the "default:" case in the switch in try_init_dmi(), 
then we'll leak the storage allocated with kzalloc() and assigned 
to 'info'.
