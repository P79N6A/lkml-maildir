As was mentioned by Domenico Andreoli the changes are just those 
required to get reiser4 to work under 2.6.5. Other differences are line 
offsets due to the fact that the debian kernel also has patches 
applied.

Unfortunately, not easily, since this is the only box that I can 
currently test this out on. However, there a couple of tests that I can 
still perform (as mentioned elsewhere in this thread) and I will report 
back on the results of those later tonight.
