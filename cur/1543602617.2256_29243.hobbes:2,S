I am currently trying to compile and install a new
kernel (2.4.10) into my Mandrake system.
I decided to use the 'make oldconfig' option in an
effort to keep the current settings.
I created the 'bzdisk' so I can test the system prior
to compiling a 'bzImage'
After making the modules then modules_install, I
conducted a reboot and ran off the boot floppy.
I got the following error:
"nic: Attempting to kill the idle task!
In idle task - not stncing
<1> Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference
at virtual address 00000000"
Then I get a screen full of numbers and end up with:
"nic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing"
What have I done/not done to have this problem ?
Pete
