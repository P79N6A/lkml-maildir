Solved.
By the help of the kernel newbies pages, I was pointed to the page 
http://kernelnewbies.org/wiki/moin.cgi/Karthick,
 which pointed at
the label '_ret_with_reschedule' in entry.S.
This piece of assembler is called after each interrupt, and tests the 
need_resched flag to see is scheduling is nessesary.
Anyway, thanks for your time.
