Hello guys,
Is someone awared about DLTs sequential tape changers running on
Linux ?
We used an HP SureStore DLT 30/70GB linked to a Mylex Flash LT. Fine.
Quite a litte slow but fine.
Nevertheless, due to huge amount of data to save, I am looking now
for a sequential changer driving 5 or 8 (or 16) DLTs to be
used automatically during large backups (600 GB)
Any idea about?
Regards
