We have two similar systems, using acenic gigabit cards, plugged into a
3com Superstack 3 10/100/1000 switch.
When we use kdb on one of the systems, the other system stops receiving
packets.
We've seen this from kernel 2.4.2 with the kdb patches from oss.sgi.com to
2.4.4 with the patches.
Are there any thoughts on this? Any other information that may prove to be
useful?
