Well, may I suggest that the impact on end users is absolutely not the 
same :
	- 4KSTACKS only bites people that use badly written drivers allocating 
a lot of local variables on the stack (Nvidia, ...) and the availiable 
stack using this config is (from what I've read on this list) roughly 
equivalent to what is availiable in 2.4 series...
	- REGPARAM kills any driver whith object only file containing system calls,
Concerning the number of ways the kernel is compiled, I think that the 
number of GCC version produce even more debugging path than theses 
options. I really wonder if this is not a tactical game to push hardware 
manufacturer. But beware it could strike back because some supplier may 
just give up if they have to work on their driver even on stable series...
