What I wanted to mention was the difficulties or efforts to make
assumptions real.  I never meant a circular argument, but if you
felt so I apologize sincerely.

Permission bits can be checked easily with "ls" command,
but assuring the correctness of labels are not that easy.
I'll try to explain.
The correctness of the permission bit for a given file can be judged
solely by the result of "ls" command.  The correctness of the label,
on the other hand, can't be judged without understanding of whole policy
including domain transitions. (see the attached figure)
I can imagine that once one get the complete SELinux policy,
then it is able to modify and maintain it.
I don't say making a complete SELinux policy is impossible,
and actually you said you did it.  But to be frank, I don't think
you are the average level user at all. ;-)

0) I understood the default policy and perfectly understand the
every behavior of my system.
this is where the difficulties exist.

Thank you for the procedures.  It's quite helpful.

Every pathname-based security must provide the mechanism
to prevent a conflicting/malicious access, otherwise it's junk.
I have a question for you.  With current implementation of
SELinux, only one label can be assigned.  But there are cases
that one object can be used in different context, so I think
it might help if SELinux would allow objects to have
multiple labels. (I'm not talking about conflicts here)
What do you think?

I believe what you wrote, but it may not be as easy for average Linux users.
