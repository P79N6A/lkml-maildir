Yes.

That actually wouldn't be my initial concern. Otherwise I'm happy to point 
out kernel bloat, but here it's more important to prototype a mechanism. 
In this case bloat can still be fixed later, as it's rather isolated 
behind a standard API.

The problem here is twofold. First, duplication means extra maintenance 
overhead, various version of the copies have to be kept in sync. The 
temptation to fix only the kernel version without updating the normal 
version could be quite big, so that users might not realize they have 
broken tools until they e.g. try reconfigure the system.
Second, whatever we deliver with the kernel, might become part of kernel 
API (e.g. config files), which needs to be supported for a long time. 
Compatibility code can accumulate rather quickly.

klibc will continue as independent project anyway, so it should not be 
difficult to include from the kernel whatever the distribution provides. 
It would help avoiding possible problems with mixing binaries built from 
different libraries.
