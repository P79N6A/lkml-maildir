I've had to support an app running as a back-end to a webserver that would
malloc() different amounts of memory depending on user input, up to
multiple gigabytes of memory which vastly exceeded the 512k the machine
had as main memory.  The app was a program that would scan genetic
sequence looking for 'repeats' in the sequence, and one sequence would
malloc a hundred megs while a similar sequence of the same size would
cause the algorithm to try to malloc over a gig.  Part of the algorithm
was actually to simply try to malloc all the memory it could and if it ran
out, it would bump down the resolution that it was scanning with and try
again.  And it would regularly push the machine into OOM and take it down
because daemons got killed long before the OOM killer got around to taking
out the process that was malloc()ing all the memory.  On other machines
I'd set RLIMIT_DATA and my OOM problems went away, but on linux this
didn't work (and i wasn't comfortable enough with kernel sources back then
to manage to find RLIMIT_AS).
