My approach is something like the others.  I developed a small wrapper to catch
unaligned traps on alpha.  What it does is run a program in gdb with some
specified arguments (it also sets up so that the process gets a SIGBUS when it
does an unaligned access, but that's probably not relevant here).
Any case, its available by anonymous ftp at 
ftp://uncarved.com/unaligned.c
 
in case you're interested...
