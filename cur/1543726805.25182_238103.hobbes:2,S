Sorry for the delay in reponse to this thread.  I've been testing this out,
and it takes awhile.
Well, sadly, I was *wrong*.  After a couple days my 2.4.26 kernel completely
died on me too.
So, I back tracked to 2.4.22, which I had previously thought stable.  But
no, it also died.
So, I started at the beginning.
Here are my results:
2.4.0-2.4.9:  Do not compile.
2.4.10-2.4.15: 'Oops' on boot.
2.4.16-2.4.17: skipped
2.4.18:       Same SMP symptoms.
So, I could try 16/17, but I don't think it matter much at this point.
What should my next step be?
Thanks for all the help so far.
Jason
