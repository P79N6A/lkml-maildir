The PCI Busmaster bit should (read must) be set by the driver to enble
bus-mastering after the dma mask is set.
   Commands are (in order):
    pci_set_dma_mask(dev, 0xffffffffULL);    // 32 bit DMA only
    pci_set_drvdata(dev, NULL);              // Harmless if unused
    pci_set_power_state(dev, 0);             // Turn it ON
    pci_set_master(dev);                     // Make bus-master
    pci_set_mwi(dev);	// Check return, different code
    pci_write_config_dword(dev, PCI_COMMAND, PCI_CONFIG_YOU_DEFINE);
   Typical bus-master PCI_CONFIG_YOU_DEFINE is:
     (PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY|PCI_COMMAND_MASTER|PCI_COMMAND_SERR)
