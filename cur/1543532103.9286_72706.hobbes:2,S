Actually, now I come to think of it, I believe the BSD rules work:
  0) the system starts with total swap+ram counting as "available
     virtual ram"
  1) a "secure" process must have 8MB of "available virtual ram" 
     before it can be started successfully (replace 8MB with rlimit, in
     general).
  2) every time a secure process starts up it reduces the "available
      virtual ram" by 8MB.
  3) a process can start up with less than 8MB available, or not reduce
     the available amount by 8MB, but in that case it will be marked
     "volatile", which means that it is a candidate for killing if the
     kernel needs more swap/ram.
This ensures that a secure processes stack has somewhere to be paged out
to, and that therefore the kernel need never kill it when trying to
find swap space in which to put processes current stack pages.
