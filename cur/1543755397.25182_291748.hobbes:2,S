Sounds sane.  We need to make certain there is a checksum of that
region but putting it in a separate segment should ensure that.
I also think we need to look at the name crashimage= and see if we
can find something more descriptive.  But that is minor.  Possibly
elfcorehdr=  We have a little while to think about that one before we
are stuck.

A clarification on terminology we are talking about struct Elf64_Phdr
here.  There is only one Elf header.  That seems to be clear farther
down.

Agreed.  Size is not the primary issue.  There is some clear waste
but that is a secondary concern.  Not performing a 1-1 mapping
to the kernel data structures also seems to be a win, as the concepts
are noticeably different.

I have serious concerns about the kernel generating the ELF headers
and only delivering them after the kernel has crashed.  Because
then we run into questions of what information can be trusted.  If we
avoid that issue I am not too concerned.

For a first round doing it in user space sounds sane.  Obtaining
the information at the time of load is much more robust.

At least for a start.

Either that or /proc/cpuinfo.  But the sysconf approach looks more
robust at this point.

The nice thing about doing this in user space is that we can hack
something together and get each side of the interface sorted
out independently.  i.e. We can hard code it for now.  Sort out
the users and then come back and make certain we have the information
exported cleanly. 1K per cpu currently matches the kernel code so
it is a good place to start :)
It does look like getting the size of each array element is a problem,
so the current kernel code certainly needs to be revisited.  And
there are quite a few other things pieces of how we are obtaining
the information that can be fixed as well.

I like that.  I was thinking a virtual versus physical address
separation.  But using the offset field is much more appropriate,
and it leaves us the potential of doing something nice like specifying
the kernels virtual address later on.  Looking exclusively at the
offset field to know which memory addresses to dump sounds good.
For now we should have virtual==physical==offset except for the
backup region.
This sounds like a good place to start.
