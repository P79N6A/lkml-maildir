I must admit that I'm not very keen on this.
I would much rather that in-kernel autodetect were deprecated rather
than enhanced.
Just use 'mdadm' in an initrd, or during normal boot, to assemble all
your arrays.
However.....

No.  No-one outside this file uses them, so they are fine where they
are.

Probably list_add_tail would be better so the ordering is the same as
it was before?

i_passed is never used.
And what is the point of i_loops (and i_scanned)?  The comments
at the top of the patch should explain this if there is a good reason.

list_entry will *never* return NULL.   It simply doesn't pointer
arithmetic.  (Well, I guess it could return NULL if it was passed
NULL, and the struct-offset were 0, but that isn't the case here).
So you don't need this 'if' at all.

so you don't need to worrying about indents.

I'm not dead-set against the change, and if you tidy it up I'll
probably accept it, but I really think you would be better off skipping
the in-kernel autodetect stuff altogether and use mdadm to assemble
your arrays.
