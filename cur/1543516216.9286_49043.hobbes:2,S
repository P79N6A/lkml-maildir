I'm very sorry to post this question here but I can't seem to find this info
anywhere else.  I would like to know if there are (I presume there will be)
any system calls in the Linux kernel to access information on the memory of
the current system, such as amount of memory used, free, used swap, free
swap...etc.  Much like can be achieved by reading the /proc/meminfo file.  I
have a small application that displays this info, it is currently using
/proc/meminfo, but I would like to utilize any system calls in the kernel to
access this information if I can.
Also what are the thoughts of people on this list as to using /proc/meminfo
for this kind of task?  I've been seeing some negative posts in other
mailing lists as to using proc at all, although I think it's quite a nice
feature.
Thanks in advance,
Jeff Buckey
