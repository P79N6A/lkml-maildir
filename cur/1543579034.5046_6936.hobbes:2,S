SCSI host probe order has never been guaranteed, afaik -- this is not
new to 2.4.  If you have multiple host adapters, you really need to use
the command line to say which is which, as always.  If you don't, you
will be bitten eventually.
"Eventually" in this case meant 2.2->2.4, perhaps, but that doesn't
make it an item for Documentation/Changes.  Or is this not what you
were talking about?
