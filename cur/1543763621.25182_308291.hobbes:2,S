I had the same results yesterday, while punishing the swap by building
the kernel with make -j64 over NFS.  It thrashed wildly for 20 minutes
or so then eventually all disk activity stopped.  Of course that stupid
cow continued bouncing up and down...
It wasn't clear from your last mail whether you were using NFS.  If so I
would be suspicious given the NFS changes in the new RT patches.  I'll
try to reproduce the problem on a local fs.
