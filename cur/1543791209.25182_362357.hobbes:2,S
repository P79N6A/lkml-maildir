Three issues here.  Fragmentation of memory in general, fragmentation of usage, 
and being able to have 100% success rate at removing memory.
We will never be able to have 100% contiguous memory with no fragmentation. 
Ever.  Certainly not while we have non-movable pieces of memory.  Even if we 
could move every piece of memory it would be impractical.  What these patches do 
for general fragmentation is to keep the allocations that never will get freed 
away from the rest of memory, so that memory has a chance to form larger 
contiguous ranges when it is freed.
By separating memory based on usage there is another side effect.  It also makes 
possible some more active defragmentation methods on easier memory, because it 
doesn't have annoying hard memory scattered throughout.  Suddenly we can talk 
about being able to do memory hotplug remove on significant portions of memory. 
    Or allocating these hugepages after boot.  Or doing active defragmentation. 
  Or modules being able to be modules because they don't have to preallocate big 
pieces of contiguous memory.
Some people will argue that we need 100% separation of usage or no separation at 
all.  Well, change the array of fallback to not allow kernel non-reclaimable to 
fallback and we are done.  4 line change, 100% separation.  But the tradeoff is 
that under memory pressure we might fail allocations when we still have free 
memory.  There are other options for fallback of course, the fallback_alloc() 
function is easily replaceable if somebody wants to.  Many of these options get 
easier once memory migration is in.  The way fallback is done in the current 
patches is to maintain current behavior as much as possible, satisfy 
allocations, and not affect performance.
As to the 100% success at removing memory, this set of patches doesn't solve 
that.  But it solves the 80% problem quite nicely (when combined with the memory 
migration patches).  80% is great for virtualized systems where the OS has some 
choice over which memory to remove, but not the quantity to remove.  It is also 
a good start to 100%, because we can separate and identify the easy memory from 
the hard memory.  Dave Hansen has outlined in separate posts how we can get to 
100%, including hard memory.

Perfectly stated.
