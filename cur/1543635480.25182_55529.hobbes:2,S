This isn't dead at all. Rusty and I talked about this at the kernel 
summit, and there was no loud verbal dissention (that I remember). 
Unfortunately, progress has been temporarily hampered by a few things,
like the factd that the people that this type of stuff actually turns on
are few in number, and distracted by several other projects...
