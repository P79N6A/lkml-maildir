Using umount still leaves the iPod flashing a "do not disconnect" 
message as I recall, while eject clears it. So while umount may be all 
the o/s needs, and all some external storage media need, it may be 
highly desirable to do the eject for the benefit of the attached device, 
to cue it to finish whatever it's caching internally. Whatever eject 
does clearly is device visible, and in the case of iPod the device 
objects if it isn't given.
I would think that allowing it on any device on which the caller has 
write permission would cover the security aspects. In this case I would 
prefer not taking the "my XXX doesn't need it" approach, and do it 
unless there's a reason not to.
Not allowing a CD/DVD burner to "prevent media removal" on a device for 
which the user has write permission is another case of questionable 
security. Since that prevents unpatched growisofs from being used by a 
user it has a real negative effect and no obvious (to me) security 
benefit. I don't think of a case where I want to pull a media as it's 
burning...
