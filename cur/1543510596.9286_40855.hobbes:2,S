AFIK wbindv has nothing to do with the tlb. It only flushes the L1/2 cache
to memory and invalidate all the cachelines.
After changing a _PAGE_GLOBAL pte you should run an "invlpg" on the
virtual address of the page. For the asm implementation of invlpg see
__flush_tlb_one() (for the recent chips).
