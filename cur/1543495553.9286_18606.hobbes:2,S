   Note: it has also my wake-one on accept that just address completly the
   overscheduling problem.
"Completely"?  I beg to differ, watch and you will see that on every
new TCP connection, there will be 2 spurious and unnecessary wakeups,
and these originate in the write_space socket callback because as we
free up the SYN frames we wakeup listening socket sleepers.
I've been working today on solving this very issue.
