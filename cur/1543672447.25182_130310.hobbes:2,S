250GB partition, FAT32 LBA (partition type 0x0c i think).
The problem is verry inconsistent as i said earlier, so the number of
files in a directory doesn't seem to matter, nor do the depth in the
directory structure. Some files i manage to copy yo the disk, some files i
don't... I havent managed to find any pattern in what files this affects.
