I think you'd do far better to implement it yourself for half a dozen
architectures.  It's not my job to teach you things which can be
gained by reading the code and thinking a little.
We're going in a circle again.

No, it's exactly the same as before.  You can't see that, and I've
given up explaining it.

This problem is in your mind Roman.
Deal with it.

Quoting Al's rant isn't an argument.  It wasn't very coherent when he
wrote it, and it doesn't gain with repetition.
The code exists.  It's simple to use.
I give up.  You're killfiled again 8(
