This is not correct.  Reducing API abuse is simply a bonus.
The rationale for the patch is to remove unneeded infrastructure which 
complicates security by introducing the idea that the security module can 
be removed at all.
It was in response to your very own posting about the new capabilities 
code which would need to take this into account.

The underlying issue here is the notion of security mechanisms which are 
built as loadable modules.  It's not useful for any in-tree users, and 
introduces several unnecessary problems which then need to be addressed.
A better approach would be to make LSM a statically linked interface.
This would also allow us to unexport the LSM symbols and reduce the API 
abuse by third-party modules.
