Hi
	I've got a linux box here running 2.2.17.  ifconfig reveals this
for eth0:
          RX packets:2147483647 errors:11 dropped:0 overruns:140 frame:22
          TX packets:2147483647 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
Thing is, it's been that way for several weeks.  Is there a counter limit
I'm hitting here with the networking code in the kernel, or is it
ifconfig?  I'm using net-tools-1.55.
Thanks.
