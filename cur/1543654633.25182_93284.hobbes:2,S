Hello,
I was trying to use kgdb.
But I get the following error while trying to create
the kernel image after applying kgdb patch.
I couldn't copy paste the error and so typed the same
here.
"
i386_ksyms.c:172: 'do_BUG' undeclared here (not in a
function)
i386_ksyms.c:172: initializaer element is not a
constant
i386_ksyms.c:172: (near initialization for
'__ksymtab_do_BUG.value')
make[1]: *** [ie86_ksyms.o] Error 1
make *** [_dir_arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
"
Your earlier response would ne of great help.
Have a nice time.
Warm Regards
Arun
