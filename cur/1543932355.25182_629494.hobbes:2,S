>ata1.00: XXX DMA address 202275000 is above 32bit
Tejun-I find the allocation always above 32bit with the following tests
-
1) kernel-2.6.24-rc5 + the 32 bit limiting patch that you provided in a
previous posting.
2) vanilla-2.6.24-rc5.
But I don't find the DMA allocation above 32bit in the kernel logs when
I apply my patch on the vanilla-2.6.24-rc5 kernel.
