It's also a good reason not to use one huge partition on each disk,
and a good reason not to partition the whole disk when it's not
needed.
I've seen, (mainly desktop, not server), Linux machines with one
physical disk containing two partitions, root and swap, with the swap
partition being twice the physical memory of the box, even when the
box has more than a gigabyte of physical RAM.
It's usually more flexible just to partition the space you need, and
add more partitions when necessary.  For typical desktop use, swap
isn't even necessary with 1 GB of physical RAM.
For example, if you have an 80 GB disk, you could initially partition
10 GB for the root partition, and leave 70 GB unused.  When the root
partition fills us, you can simply use du -s /* to see which
directories are taking up the most space, and move them to separate
partitions.
