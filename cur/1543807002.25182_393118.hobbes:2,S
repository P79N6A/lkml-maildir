Yes, you are right, sorry for noise. We have exactly same situation
before de_thread() locks tasklist after killing the leader.

Actually, now I think this patch fixes a small theoretical bug.
Currently we have a tiny window in switch_exec_pids() when it
detaches ->pid from PIDTYPE_PID namespace. RCU based kill_proc_info()
does not take tasklist, so we can miss a signal.

I think you are right.
Andrew, please drop this one:

Eric's patch includes this cleanup.
