Note that it says "Disabling hardware tapping". mousedev module still
does software tap emulation which can be turned off with
mousedev.tap_time = 0

I am not quite sure about the keyboard iteractions but all-in-all I
don't think ALPS support is really ready for prime-time yet, there
some issues with tap and double-tap detection. I think Peter has some
patches improving it though, but for now I recommend
psmouse.proto=imps.

That is default sensitivity not suiting your habits I think. I would
recomment trying out Synaptics X driver (which also does ALPS) so you
will be able adjust sensitivity the way you like it.
