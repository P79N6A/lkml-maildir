Subject: ide-cd problem in 2.6.12-rc5 + todays snapshot

Background: I have a Sony CDU5211 CD drive with Intel D815EEA2 mainboard 
(ICH2 IDE in 815 chipset). Since 2.4.21 timeframe IDE DMA for this CD 
drive is broken (see my post 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0410.3/0480.html
). This 
happens on at least 2 identical machines. This is the first problem 
(that I have learned to live with).
Now, since ide-cd dma is broken, the first access to cd always gets DMA 
timeout and turns off DMA, then it works. I have hddtemp installed and 
it probes for drives on boot. In 2.6.12 (and I think I tested pristine 
2.6.12-rc5 too) the cd works as before - dma timeout+disable on first 
access (by hddtemp).
Now, in 2.6.12-rc5 + todays git snapshot, it does not work any more. I 
suspect the DMA alignment change.
In 2.6.12-rc2 the dmesg from hddtemp was
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04 { AbortedCommand }
ide: failed opcode was: 0xb0
In todays snapshot, the dmesg is
hdc: DMA interrupt recovery
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset complete

and so on ad infimum.
The messages are very similar to my earlier reported problems that were 
fixed:
