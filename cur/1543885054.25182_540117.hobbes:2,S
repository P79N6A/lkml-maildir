Sergey Afonin (cc'd) ran into the same problem when trying to use the
DFE-580TX card on a new machine with the Intel 945G chipset (I don't
have exact motherboard info - PCI subsystem ID matches Intel D945GTP)
and 2.6.18-based x86_64 kernel.
ALT Linux Bugzilla entry (sorry - it's in Russian):
https://bugzilla.altlinux.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11687
Full dmesg output:	
https://bugzilla.altlinux.org/attachment.cgi?id=1940
lspci -vvxxx output:	
https://bugzilla.altlinux.org/attachment.cgi?id=1942
I have tracked down this problem to a bad I/O base address assignment
for network chips.  As you may find from the lspci -vvxxx info, the
following addresses were assigned to region 0 of these chips:
  05:04.0 - 0x1180
  05:05.0 - 0x1100
  05:06.0 - 0x1080
  05:07.0 - 0x1000
Chips at 0x1000 and 0x1080 work fine; however, chips at 0x1100 and
0x1180 are not reachable, because the PCI-PCI bridge 04:00.0 has the
NoISA bit in the BridgeCtl register set, and these addresses are being
treated as ISA port aliases and not forwarded to the internal PCI bus of
the card.  (The bridge at 00:1e.0 also has NoISA set, but this is not a
problem, because that bridge is transparent.)  Turning off the NoISA bit
with "setpci -s 04:00.0 3e.b=00" makes all Ethernet ports work.
For comparison, the lspci -vvxxx output from an older machine, where
this card works: 
https://bugzilla.altlinux.org/attachment.cgi?id=1944
In this case the I/O port addresses for network chips are assigned
correctly: 0x9000, 0x9400, 0x9800, 0x9c00, and all ports work.
The problem looks like a BIOS bug - apparently the PCI config set up by
the BIOS is bogus.  However, can Linux at least warn, or (even better)
apply some workaround in such cases?
