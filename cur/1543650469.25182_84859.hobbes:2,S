Ok I will.  I primarily meant to put an APIC bus above pci.  And maybe
filter the APICS down.  The real challenge is that the APIC connection is
in parallel with the PCI connection.  It would take a DAG to truly model
the connections between hardware, and I have been told that people don't want that...
