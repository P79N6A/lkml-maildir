Subject: [PATCH 04/26] kbuild: introduce $(kecho) convenience echo
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/20/60

From: Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>
There is a bunch of places in the build system where we do 'echo' to show
some nice status lines.  This means we still get output when running in
silent mode.  So declare a new KECHO variable that only does 'echo' when we
are in a suitable verbose build mode.
