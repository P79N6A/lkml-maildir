This is unexpected.  High load average is due to either a task chewing a
lot of CPU time or a task stuck in uninterruptible sleep.
Can you please work out which of these is happening?  Run `top' on an idle
system.  Is the CPU less than 1% loaded?
Run
	ps aux | grep " D"
or something like that on an idle system, see if you can spot a task which
is spending time in D state.
If there's a task whcih is spending time in D state, try running
 echo w > /proc/sysrq-trigger ; dmesg -c > foo
the check "foo" to see if it has a task in D state (search foo for " D "). 
If it's not there, do the sysrq again, repeat until you've managed to
capture a trace of the blocked task.
If it turns out that the CPU really is spending excess amounts of time
being busy then a kernel profile would be a good way of finding out where
it is spinning.  Or run sysrq-P from the keyboard a few times.
