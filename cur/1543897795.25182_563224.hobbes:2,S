Its made for every thing before it goes upstream. It shouldn't be going
uptream until it works, is reliable and does something useful. Then if it
ever makes that grade it can go and sit in -mm for a bit to shake down .

SELinux orders a beer object
AppArmor order a /beer
Hilary says "You are both under 21 you can't"
SELinux orders a shandy object
AppArmor orders a /shandy
SELinux is refused because the shandy mixer opened a beer object and
	shandy inherited beer typing
AppArmor gets drunk because /shandy and /beer are clearly different
