Subject: [PATCH] fix missing wakeup in ipc/sem

Hi Andrew,
My patch that removed the spin_lock calls from the tail of
sys_semtimedop introduced a bug:
Before my patch was merged, every operation that altered an array called
update_queue. That call woke up threads that were waiting until a
semaphore value becomes 0. I've accidentially removed that call.
The attached patch fixes that by modifying update_queue: the function
now loops internally and wakes up all threads. The patch also removes
update_queue calls from the error path of sys_semtimedop: failed
operations do not modify the array, no need to rescan the list of
waiting threads.
