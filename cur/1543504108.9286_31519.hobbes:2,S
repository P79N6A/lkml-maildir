I've been seeing the same behavior, on 2.2.10 with my SCSI Smart & Friendly
CDR2006 and ATAPI Creative CD4830E (see my earlier posts to linux-kernel).  I
can also see the problem with an image mounted via loop.  So far it seems to be
only certain CDs which cause the problem.  Can you confirm what format the CDs
that are causing problems for you have?  Also what mainboard/CPU do you have?
