We're bad.
Seems that your context switch rate when running two instances of
badblocks against two different disks went batshit insane.  It doesn't
happen here.
Please capture the `vmstat 1' output while running the problematic
workload.
The oom-killing could have been unrelated to the CPU load problem.  iirc
badblocks uses a lot of memory, so it might have been genuine.  Keep an eye
on the /proc/meminfo output and send the kernel dmesg output from the
oom-killing event.
