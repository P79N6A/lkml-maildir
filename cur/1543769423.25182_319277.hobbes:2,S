Not why no - but there where *major* problems with SMP+NFS+XFS up until
2.6.11.
I run 2.6.11(.8/9) on both SMP (dual athlon) and NUMA (64 bit kernel on
dual opteron) with NFS and XFS and haven't yet seen any problems (knock
the wood).
Seriously, any 2.6 earlier than .11 is *unusable* for file serving over
NFS (at least with XFS which at the moment is the only FS with
journalled quota so at least for me that's the only option).
