It obviously _shouldn't_ make a difference.  Different hardware could
excercise different code paths though.
Not only that, but all parallel port hardware is different in some way.

The Zip drive is 'invisible' when it's not being used.  To all intents and
purposes, an idle (but powered) Zip drive may as well not be there, if
it's working properly.
Here's what I'd like you to do:
1. Have all the parport/ppa/lp stuff as modules.
2. Fresh boot, load the parport, parport_pc, and lp modules, and check
that printing works when the Zip drive isn't there.
3. Then plug the Zip drive in, and the printer into it, and see if
printing works.  If not, it pretty much has to be a hardware problem.
4. With the Zip drive still in, load the ppa module.  Find out if printing
works.  If it did before, and doesn't now, it's a parport/ppa interaction.
Try powering off and on the Zip drive and see if printing works again.
Let me know what happens.
Thanks,
Tim.
