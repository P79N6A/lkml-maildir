Hrm. Is this something that is likely to be introduced at some point?
My interest lies in the fact that I use a Linux based DVD player which
locked up for around twenty minutes the other night trying to read a
dozen bad blocks on a DVD with a single scratch...
Being able to reduce that time lag to a minimum, even if it left the
hardware delays, would be great -- even if it was only for ATAPI
devices.
The biggest slowdown was the kernel retrying each block a number of
times, then performing a full ATAPI bus reset before giving up.
