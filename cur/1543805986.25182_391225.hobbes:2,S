Now that I applied the patches correctly:
  x86-x86_64-ia64-unify-mapping-from-pxm-to-node-id.patch
  x86-x86_64-ia64-unify-mapping-from-pxm-to-node-id-fix.patch
  [PATCH 001/003]Fix unify mapping from pxm to node id. 
  [PATCH 002/003]Fix unify mapping from pxm to node id. 
  [PATCH 003/003]Fix unify mapping from pxm to node id. 
They compiled on a 2.6.16-rc1-mm3 source base, for archs:
  alpha arm i386 ia64 sparc x86_64
and they compiled and booted ok on SN2 (ia64 sn2_defconfig).
I just noticed as I typed the above that the last 3 patches all had the
same Subject "Fix unify mapping from pxm to node id."  Each patch
should have a different Subject (after the [...] is stripped.)
Other than that detail ... looks good.
