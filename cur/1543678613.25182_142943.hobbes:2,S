Yeah, I saw that.  Same time in my inbox, too. ;^)

It says on the front of the case "IBM eserver", but the "e" sort of
looks like an "@".  Also printed on the front of the case is "x220."
I have no idea if there is a service processor installed in the box.
Here is the output of lspci:

There is a 2nd Intel e100 interface on the motherboard ("planar" in
IBM-speak), but that has been set to "disabled" in the BIOS for some
reason.  Re-enabling it has no effect on the time skew, nor does the USB
legacy support that worked for someone else on a different system.
Strange, huh?
