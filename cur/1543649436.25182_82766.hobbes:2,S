Corey's IPMI driver is GPL, as are all the other components
of the kernel. People who are worried about patents on IPMI
implementations can get a royalty-free license any time by
going to 
http://www.intel.com/design/servers/ipmi/spec.htm
 
and signing the Adopter's agreement. Yes, to get the royalty-free 
patent license for implementations of the IPMI spec, you have 
to give a promise not to sue other Adopters of IPMI, but I don't 
see why anyone who isn't planning on going around suing people 
should have a problem signing this agreement. In any case this 
is very similar to USB, which also has an Adopter's agreement 
for patents, and USB has been in the kernel for years without 
causing any IP problems.
