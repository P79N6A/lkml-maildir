There are still few annoyances with slink vs. 2.1/2.2 kernels.
dmesg & klogd are not using bigger kernel log size in new kernels
(8192 bytes vs. 4096 bytes in 2.0).
acct package is incorrectly compiled (with sys/acct.h instead of
linux/acct.h, IIRC), so it doesn't work.
procinfo segfaults.
lsdev has problems.
Those are all I can remember, it would be nice to get that fixed
before 2.2.0 gets into distribution.
