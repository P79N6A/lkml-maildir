Hello
I am looking for nforce2 MCP southbridge thermal specification. Please
can anyone provide that?
It seems that I have possibly found a temperature-dependent bug in the
southbridge, that manifests long before the chip seemingly overheats.  I
would like to determine if it manifests within the operating range of
the MCP.
