The point of this test is to measure interactions, and fairness.
It answers the question "how much impact does heavy filesystem I/O have upon
other system activity?".
The "other system activity" in this test is a kernel compile.  That is a
fairly reasonable metric, because it is sensitive to latencies in servicing
reads and it is sensitive to inappropriate page replacement decisions.
A more appropriate foreground load might be opening a word processor and
composing a short letter to Aunt Nellie, but that's harder to automate.  We
expect that reduced kernel compilation time will correlate with lower-latency
letter writing.
