Confusingly similar to the single value version:  a single letter.
Far better to use "bitmask" or something similar ...
... also, better to split out discussions of gpio_chip methods
(NOT used by all implementors of the GPIO interfaces) from the
discussion of those interfaces (implemented uniformly on all
platforms that support any of the calls).
