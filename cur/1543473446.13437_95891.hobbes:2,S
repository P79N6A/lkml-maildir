Oh, those are not comments!  They are semantically meaningful lines
that happen to start with '#'.  All the flavors of configuration
translate those on input to "CONFIG_PCI_GOBIOS=n', et cetera.
By the way, the reason these are comments is because the Makefiles
read .config, and these *are* comments to the Makefiles.  And the
Makefiles do care about the difference between something with a null
value and something with a value of "=n".
I didn't design this configuration system.  I hate this configuration
system.  I am not proud to be the maintainer of Menuconfig, even though
I asked for the job.  The very existence of xconfig causes me pain.
But the part of the job I hate the most is when everyone else in the
world with a text editor writes untested crap into Config.in files and
then says "oh just make all flavors of Configuration smarter please."
I CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THIS.  And it chews up time that I want to use to
rewrite this whole compost heap of code the right way.

Actually, I don't agree with that.  But I respect Linus's judgement
even when I think he's wrong.
So now I am hip deep in kconfig.tk trying to figure out how it manages
its symbols.  And then I can't simply edit code, I have to change tkgen.c
and tkparse.c to recognize the 'unset' statement and *emit* the right
thing in kconfig.tk.
I am probably going to suggest the following patch instead:
    + else
    +   define_bool CONFIG_PCI_BIOS n
    + ...
    + else
    +   define_bool CONFIG_PCI_DIRECT n

Well, I won't argue with that one.
