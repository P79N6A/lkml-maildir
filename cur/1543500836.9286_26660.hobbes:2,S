somebody on slashdot had a bright idea: x86 and alpha architectures firmware
are located at different memory addresses. so you could have one board with
both bioses/firmware. If you have an alpha cpu, it will jump to the alpha
firmware at the usual alpha address, and if you have a k7 it will jump to
the usual x86 address. 
I don't know the relevant addresses, so i don't know if things would clash
anywhere, but it seems possible.
regards,
paul.
