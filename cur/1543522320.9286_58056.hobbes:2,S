It's not possible since ABOVE.NET choose to block ORBS. If systems @ ABOVE.NET
are blacklisted it's ABOVE.NET fault, not ORBS fault.

Hmm. Since that server is blocked spammer can mark it as "anti-spam compliant"
as well. ORBS bot can not check it.

Not dozen peoples. Just city's head. And they DO NOT SHOOT them. They just
refuse to speak with them till policy is not changed. It's what US goverment
is doing all the time: "we will not speak with you till you'll do this and
that". If it's Ok for US goverment why it's not Ok for ORBS ?

Just like US goverment (and most other goverments out there :-)...

They can blame existing one. If they will complaing loud enough provider can
change his mind. They can ask someone to work as ORBS-allowed relay for him
(if my friend will ask me to work as relay I'll give him key and allow SMTP
over SSL for him so he'll be able to send mail even if his provider is blocked
by ORBS).

Why so ? They are the ones who support provider by his money. They are the ones
who can ask him to change his mind. ORBS can not do this. But ORBS CAN blacklist
that provider and they done that.

If it's can not be checked by ORBS bot than it's Ok: ORBS can not check if
someone who marked it as "anti-spam compliant" is not spammer and can not check
itself. If not, then it's definiteally something wrong.

If there are no choice then yes.
