Hi,
I've made my linux-from-scratch with latest stable (2.4.19) kernel, made
swap, turned it on but it doesn't work. It seems it does but when there's
not enough memory, the system crashes. Either it kills the application
desiring more memory (gcc or something) or crashes the kernel with memory
dump. Neither the 2.4.20-pre5-ac3 helped.
Thank you for your help,
Vladimir Trebicky
