Yeah! That's exactly what Carl proposed in a previous message. So, I
did, but now I can't reproduce the oops with ymfpci compiled as a
module. I can only reproduce the oops if ymfpci is built-into the
kernel.
Wops! I'm lost. I'm tired and it's too late, so I'd better get some
sleep and try to guess a little bit more tomorrow.
Thanks!
