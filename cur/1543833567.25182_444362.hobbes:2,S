Dear friend.,
Good day dear friend am so sorry to inform you of the new development i have
seen a new pertiner and I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting
those funds transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from paraguay.
Presently i'm in Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of the total
sum. meanwhile,i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in
transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.
Now contact my secretary in Benin his name is Ali on belloali@mywaycom ask him
to send you the total money of $800.000.00 which i kept for your compensation
for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I
appreciated your efforts at that time very much. so feel free to get in touched
with my secretary Ali and instruct him where to send the amount to you.
Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy
after all the sufferness at that time. in the moment, Im very busy here
because of the investment projects which me and the new partner are having at
hand, finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on
your behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with Ali, He
will send the amount to you without any delay.
Regards,
Elder Micchael.
