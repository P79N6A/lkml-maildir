Wouldn't that result in the following scenario:
1) freeswan gets merged into the kernel
2) davem fixes a networking thing which
   happens to touch freeswan
3) the freeswan developers don't take davem's
   fix into their tree
4) the next patch by the freeswan people doesn't
   apply to what's in the kernel
Somehow this scenario doesn't seem like it would make
the ipsec implementation very maintainable.
Maybe it would be better to use what the usagi people
are building, just to have an easier maintainable system?

Rik
