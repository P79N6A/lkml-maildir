Not if you have to take an alignment fault, which is easily several 
thousand cycles.
Think of "get_unaligned()" as a worst-case limiter. It can make the best 
case be worse on architectures where it matters, but it can make the worst 
case go from thousands of cycles to just single cycles.
And your flash isn't _that_ slow. Thousands of cycles that can't even 
overlap with any flash IO _does_ show up.
Now, whether the unaligned case is common enough for people to even worry, 
I don't know.
