The SMART data is the temperature recorded by the drive itself.  There
are various places where these measurements may be made, the actual
implementation is vendor specific.
An ambient temperature exceeding 55C would void most drive warranties,
it isn't a good idea.  Sure, your drive may survive at higher temps,
but it really is a bad idea.
