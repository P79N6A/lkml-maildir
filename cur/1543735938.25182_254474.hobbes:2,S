And here's the 3 line patch that I added to the usb core to hook up both
the usb and usb-serial drivers to support the modules symlinks.
I'll go mess with the pci core now, but as there is no "struct module *"
in the pci driver structure, it will take a bit of auditing to get them
all hooked up properly.
thanks,
