Ahh, right.  I never thought of it like that.  Perhaps a more
elegant solution would be to test wether EXTRAVERSION were set or
not, and then automatically add a "-" instead.
if [ -z $EXTRAVERSION ] ; then
	KERNELRELEASE=$(VERSION).$(PATCHLEVEL).$(SUBLEVEL)
else
	KERNELRELEASE=$(VERSION).$(PATCHLEVEL).$(SUBLEVEL)-$(EXTRAVERSION)
fi
Something like that...  Just an idea...
Take care,
