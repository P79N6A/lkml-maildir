Hmm.
If you're doing these kinds of Lindent changes, you might as well also
fix another non-linuxism:
	return (x);	->	return x;
I don't know why some people seem to think that "return" is a function
with an argument..
I guess that one isn't mentioned in the CodingStyles thing. I'm lazy.
Bad Bad Linus.
