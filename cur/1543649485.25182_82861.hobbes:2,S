I had sent a quite similar patch to Gerd and the v4l list (where I am
not subscribed) on Oct 6th. The only thing I got was the "maintainer
action required" reply from the list bot. As the archive is for
subsribers only I cannot say if it ever reached the list.
Alan please include this patch in -ac2.
To Suse-folks: what happend to gerd ? I had seen lots of questions
	regarding v4l2 on this list but no answers.
