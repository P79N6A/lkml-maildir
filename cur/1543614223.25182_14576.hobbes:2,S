Interestingly, the subject of bit-stuffing came up during the discussion of 
modem testing, because of the HDLC framing used in V.42 error 
control.  Statistics provided by the representative from Hayes (R.I.P.) 
showed that bit-stuffing occurred in roughly 1 out of 64 bits in the data 
path when V.42 bis data compression was enabled.  The 1:63 ratio held over 
a surprisingly wide range of data patterns, all the way from repeated 
single characters through text in English, French, German, and Chinese to 
the output of a 64-bit random number generator.  When v.42 bis data 
compression was disabled, the average ratio was about the same but there 
was considerably more spread because of data pattern sensitivity.
Which is grossly off-topic but I thought a few of you might be interested.
