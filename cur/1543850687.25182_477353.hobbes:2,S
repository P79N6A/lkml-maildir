Well, consult <
http://kerneljanitors.org/>,
 or start to send patches.
My first step was to open top Makefile with emacs, and just to save file
(without even editing it). Resulting patch broke some old `make' on
Andrew Morton's test field:
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-mm-commits&m=116198944205036&w=2>
That means top Makefile is writen with errors, somebody doesn't edit
kernel versions with "decent editor" (;
But it's working for many years and kernel versions. This yields, that
linux kernel is written by open source developers with help of users.
And it's written for to do the job. ^1
Do not expect much, just help with what you can. But i would suggest to
search archives, read sources (1.0, 2.0. 2.2, 2.4) + apply ^1 before any
questions.
