This could give an advantage for e.g. networked daemons, too. No more 
root privilege necessary for applications just to bind to a privileged 
port which does make life easier (CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE). Other ideas for 
e.g. CAP_NET_RAW or CAP_SYS_RAWIO come to mind. Using the current 
capabilties in this design as all incuding supersets that can be defined 
more fine grained in a later step I guess should suit others, too. The 
remaining problem would then be the design of an extensible interface 
that is backwards compatible.
