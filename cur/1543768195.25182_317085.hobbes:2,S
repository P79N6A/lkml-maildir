As I understand it, the $(shell ...) construct doesn't "work" in the case 
cited above because make evaluates/expands the $(shell ...) stuff while it 
is parsing the makefile and building the command list--i.e. before it has 
issued any commands to build anything.  What seems to be desired in this 
case is a file-existence test which runs "inline" with respect to the 
preceding commands.  The use of $(shell ...) inside a command 
subverts/preempts that natural sequence.  I think. :-)
