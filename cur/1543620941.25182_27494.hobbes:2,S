A vague memory of when I used to use a neomagic-based laptop tells me that you
might want to try giving lilo (or whatever bootmanager you're using) a
parameter to limit your memory to 1MB less than your actual memory... although
this is from way back in 2.2.[789] days, I think. (For lilo, that would mean
typing mem=xxxM or adding append="mem=xxxM" to /etc/lilo.conf, where xxx is
your total RAM minus 1.)
