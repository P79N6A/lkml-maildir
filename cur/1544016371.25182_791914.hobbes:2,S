Subject: [RESEND][PATCH] early platform drivers V2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Magnus Damm <damm@igel.co.jp>
This patch is V2 of the early platform driver implementation.
Platform drivers are great for embedded platforms because we
can separate driver configuration from the actual driver. So
base addresses, interrupts and other configuration can be kept
with the processor or board code, and the platform driver can
be reused by many different platforms.
For early devices we have nothing today. For instance, to configure
early timers and early serial ports we cannot use platform devices.
This because the setup order during boot. Timers are needed before
the platform driver core code is available. The same goes for early
printk support. Early in this case means before initcalls.
These early drivers today have their configuration either hard coded
or they receive it using some special configuration method. This is
working quite well, but if we want to support both regular kernel
modules and early devices then we need to have two ways of configuring
the same driver. A single way would be better.
The early platform driver patch is basically a set of functions that
allow drivers to register themselves and architecture code to locate
them and probe. Registration happens through early_param(). The time
for the probe is decided by the architecture code.
The drivers are regular compiled-in modules with the exception that
they also register themselves using early_platform_init():
 +static int __init sh_cmt_init(void)
 +{
 +       return platform_driver_register(&sh_cmt_device_driver);
 +}
 +
 +static void __exit sh_cmt_exit(void)
 +{
 +       platform_driver_unregister(&sh_cmt_device_driver);
 +}
 +
 +early_platform_init("earlytimer", &sh_cmt_device_driver);
 +module_init(sh_cmt_init);
 +module_exit(sh_cmt_exit);
The architecture code can then decide whenever it wants to probe for
early platform devices. The architecture code simply does:
 +void __init time_init(void)
 +{
 +       early_platform_driver_probe("earlytimer", sh_timer_pdevs,
 +                                   sh_timer_nr_pdevs, 1);
This will first make sure that all compiled-in early platform drivers
belonging to the class "earlytimer" get registered. After that the
platform devices passed to the function are scanned through and matched
against the registered early platform drivers. The user can select which
device that should be prioritized by specifying the classname and platform
device name together with id on the kernel commandline. For instance the
string "earlytimer=cmt0" will match the driver named "cmt" with id 0.
Later when the platform device core code is up and running the driver
can turn itself into a regular platform device in the regular probe()
callback.
Comments anyone? Maybe there are better ways to do this?

 This patch was previously sent to LKML 2008-12-15.
 Changes since V1:
 - changed function names to use "early_" prefix
 - use struct early_platform_driver for data
 - added support for matching against pdev->id
 - use early_platform_init() in device drivers
 - added more comments
