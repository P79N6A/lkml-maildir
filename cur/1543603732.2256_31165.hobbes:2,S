So it needs a handbrake in case of a emergency? The box at work deadlocks
or crashes. I can hardly call that normal operational behaviour.
I have a Dell PE 2500 (Serverworks LE) with 2GB ram and 2 1.13Ghz
processors. If I disable HIGHMEM (4GB) support the box does not produce
these allocations messages and does not deadlock or die under the same
load or worse. What I used was a mongo.pl with 5 processes (does not
matter if the
fs is ext2 reiserfs or xfs) and the box dies within minutes/seconds after
starting the benchmark.
This happens using either 2.4.10-xfs or 2.4.11-pre3-xfs.
Using a single process hides the issue.

The system is beafy enough to tolerate something mundane as this. It
should definitely not die.
