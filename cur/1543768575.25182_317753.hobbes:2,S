It requires a request per object, but it should be possible (with
somewhat more complicated code) to overlap them such that it doesn't
require a serial round trip for each. Since the server is sending static
files, the overhead for each should be minimal.

In the present mainline, you first have to find the head commit you
want. I have a patch which does this for you over the same
connection. Starting from that point, it tracks reachability on the
receiving end, and requests anything it doesn't have.
For the case of having nothing to do, it should be a single one-line
request/response for a static file (after which the local end determines
that it has everything it needs without talking to the server).
