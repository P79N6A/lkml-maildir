I apologize for sending a separate cover letter for a single patch.

So here's the definition of the x86_64 find_first_bit() macro, straight 
from include/x86_64/bitops.h:
#define find_first_bit(addr,size) \
((__builtin_constant_p(size) && (size) <= BITS_PER_LONG ? \
   (__scanbit(*(unsigned long *)addr,(size))) : \
   find_first_bit(addr,size)))
In this case "boolean" is:
    __builtin_constant_p(size) && (size) <= BITS_PER_LONG
the first arm of the conditional is:
    __scanbit(*(unsigned long *)addr,(size))
the second arm of the conditional is:
    find_first_bit(addr,size)
(this is the "function" version of find_first_bit, not the macro that's 
being defined.  The naming here is unfortunately confusing).
Thus, roughly speaking, when the type of "size" is smaller than a long, 
the macro's return type evaluates to unsigned long.  If "size" is larger 
than a long, the macro's return type evaluates to signed long.
By making the return type of __scanbit() an unsigned long, both arms of 
the conditional evaluate to the same result type.

Well, I can only assume what you mean by this, but I think that would 
address the problem.
My real interest here is to eliminate a whole lot of compiler noise when 
I enable -Wsign-compare for certain parts of the kernel.
