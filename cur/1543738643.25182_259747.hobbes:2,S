With 2.6.9-rc4, using matroxfb, I can no longer pass
video=1280x1024-8@85.  This worked on 2.6.8.1, and I'm trying kernels
inbetween now.
$ cat /proc/cmdline 
root=/dev/hda1 ro video=1280x1024-8@85 elevator=cfq 
$ zgrep -E CONFIG_\(FB\|VIDEO\).*= /proc/config.gz 
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_MODE_HELPERS=y
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
CONFIG_FB_MATROX=y
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G450=y
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G100=y
CONFIG_FB_MATROX_I2C=y
$ dmesg | grep matrox
matroxfb: Matrox G450 detected
matroxfb: MTRR's turned on
matroxfb: 640x480x8bpp (virtual: 640x26214)
matroxfb: framebuffer at 0xCC000000, mapped to 0xe0880000, size 33554432
matroxfb_crtc2: secondary head of fb0 was registered as fb1
