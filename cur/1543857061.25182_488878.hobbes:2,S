I thought it was, but from my look through yout 8-billion-task backtrace,
no task was stuck in D-state with the appropriate call trace.
So I don't know what's causing this.  In the first trace you have at least
four D-state kjournalds and a lot of processes stuck on an i_mutex.  I
guess it's consistent with an IO system which is losing completion
interrupts.  AFAICT in the second trace all you have is a lot of processes
stuck on i_mutex for no obvious reason - I don't know why that would
happen.
How long does it take for this to happen?
Yes, lockdep might find something.
