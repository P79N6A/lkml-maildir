"S" is one of the following (from MAINTAINERS):
        Supported:      Someone is actually paid to look after this.
        Maintained:     Someone actually looks after it.
        Odd Fixes:      It has a maintainer but they don't have time to do
                        much other than throw the odd patch in. See below..
        Orphan:         No current maintainer [but maybe you could take the
                        role as you write your new code].
        Obsolete:       Old code. Something tagged obsolete generally means
                        it has been replaced by a better system and you
                        should be using that.
