If you want more details on this kind of issue, look at CP-Miner.  A
paper published earlier this year in IEEE TSE[1] reports that that
tool found 421 cut-and-paste-related possible bugs in Linux, of which
49 were real bugs, 249 were false positives, and 123 could not be
proven either true or false positives.
