Hmm, i didn't think NMI handlers called that. e.g. nmi watchdog just
uses jiffies.
get_cycles_sync patching happens only relatively early at boot, so oprofile
cannot be running yet.

Ok it's a fair point.  But how would you address it ?
Even if we IPIed the other CPUs NMIs or MCEs could still happen.
BTW Jeremy, have you ever considered that problem with paravirt ops
patching?

This cannot happen for the current code: 
- full alternative patching happen only at boot when the other CPUs
are not running
- smp lock patching only ever changes a single byte (lock prefix) of
a single instruction
- kprobes only ever change a single byte
For the immediate value patching it also cannot happen because
you'll never modify multiple instructions and all immediate values
can be changed atomically.

kprobes does that, but to write the break point it uses text_poke() 
with my patch.

Hmm, perhaps it would make sense to add a comment warning about
the limitations of the current text_poke. Can you supply one?
