Are you still only seeing these problems on loopback?  I can't help but wonder 
if this is the skb_clone() problem where it wasn't copying skb->iif causing 
SELinux to silently drop the packets.  Then again, I'm not sure if there is a 
clone operation in the code path are going down.  From what I can remember I 
only saw clones on some of the multicast stuff but I'm still learning some of 
the darker corners of the stack.
If you've got some spare cycles, the kernel below should both have the 
clone/iif fix (it's in Linus' tree now) as well as some printks when errors 
occur so packet's are no longer silently dropped by SELinux.
