That sounds like a configuration error, or not running depmod/modprobe 
properly. svc_wake_up() &co are exported by the sunrpc module, and you've 
apparently not loaded it..
As to what the "DV failed", it's apparently normal if DV is disabled, 
whatever the hell that is.  James will know whether it's something to 
worry about..
