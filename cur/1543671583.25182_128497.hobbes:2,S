Can I object that it came built onto the board? okok... i'll take that 
as a no for now...
Tho i'm still not quite sure how it makes a diff to be honest, unless 
you mean that the Promise and HPT will never be supported for DMA?
and the only other thing i should say is that altho i'm not exactly a 
n00b, the average user WILL expect it to work.
can i expect this to be fixed by 2.6? (yeah, i know... 2.4-ac-ide code 
is similar to 2.5-ide code)
