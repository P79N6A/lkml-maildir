Yes.

Basically git-bisect is an automated binary search through patches
to help find bugs.  If you ever can't compile at an intermediate
patch git-bisect and other people walking through the patches
looking for bugs won't like it.
It's not mandatory that you never break anything in a patchset,
but it is much friendlier when you can avoid breakage.
