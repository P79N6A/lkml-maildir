Hi,
As far as I know 2.2.0 doesn't have the ability to do what I need it to.
The idea behind that patch was to restrict all outbound connections to
users with a uid < 1000 or in group 103 except to certain ports.  The fact
that it works for a while indicates the patch is sound but I am by no
means a kernel hacker so I don't know why it would stop working after a
day or two of uptime.
Furthermore, I wrote a little program that makes a test connection to a
remote site and executed it as a user which was not in group 103 and it
went through but when I put it into the user's crontab, it failed as it
should.  So it's only succeeding when the user is logged in.
