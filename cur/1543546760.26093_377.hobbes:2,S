That's not the problem.
I think what Jamie is overlooking is all the details.
For example, take the really obvious one: sure, you don't need a kernel
stack under some circumstances.
What are you going to do when you DO need one?
Allocate one dynamically?
Good-bye performance.
That's why I said "Show me the code". I'm rather unconvinced that you can
actually get the details right without huge amounts of complexity.
I'm sure it could be done. I'm pretty convinced that there is no way to do
it efficiently.
