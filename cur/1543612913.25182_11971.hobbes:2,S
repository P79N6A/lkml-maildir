So obvious that it's been re-introduced 3 times now even though
it broke each time. ;)
The only way to get stuff balanced somewhat is to call the
shrink functions unconditionally. It's not optimally balanced,
but at least the cache will stay reasonably small while still
being able to grow under load.
