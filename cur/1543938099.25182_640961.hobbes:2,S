Is there an existing linux userspace interface for accessing the 
microsecond or nanosecond level (a|m|c)times of filesystems that support 
them (e.g. ext4, xfs)? and possibly also the generation counters used by 
NFS.
I notice sys_utimes is able to set microsecond (c|a|m)times but I can't 
find an associated interface to read them (I've googled to no avail).
(also noticing freebsd and darwin's struct stat contains struct timespec 
for these as well as an st_gen field - although I do realise how 
incredibly difficult it would be to add these to linux's struct stat).
