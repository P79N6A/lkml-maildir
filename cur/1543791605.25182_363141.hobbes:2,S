I have no idea if this is related at all, but I have had system time
speed issues on my machine for a while too.
With 2.6.8 it always ran fine, with 2.6.12 it seemed to gain around 10
minutes per hour, and so far today with 2.6.14 it seems to be gaining
about 3 or 4 minutes per hour.  These are all Debian kernels, although I
hope they haven't added/removed anything that would affect this.
This is happening on an Asus A7N8X-E-DX with an Athlon XP 2800+.  I have
acpi enabled, so who knows if that is what is breaking things.  There
does seem to have been time keeping issues on ati chipsets big time in
recent kernels, and some other acpi issues at times, so it wouldn't
surprise me if a fix for one issue causes problems on another chipset.
The chipset on this board is the nforce2.
