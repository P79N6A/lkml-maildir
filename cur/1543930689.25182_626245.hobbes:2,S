Still, it looks like a path. :)
Please don't reference any device directly with a /sys/devices/ path.
You have to use the subsystem links to the devices
in /sys/bus/dst/devices/. Devices are free to move around
in /sys/devices, even during runtime. Yours don't do, but anyway, please
remove all mentioning of direct access to /sys/devices/.
Btw, where is the top-level /sys/devices/storage/ coming from? I don't
see that in the code. We don't accept any new "virtual parents" here.
Your devices will automatically appear in /sys/devices/virtual/dst/, and
not below your own parent. But that path does not matter anyway, because
you should only access them from the /sys/bus/dst/devices/ directory.
And in general please don't claim generic names like "storage" in any
namespace for a very specific subsystem like this.

Ok, how does:
  ls -l /sys/devices/storage/n-0-ffff81003e24117
look?

How does:
  ls -l /sys/bus/dst/devices
look?
Further questions:
Why do you do your own refcounting instead of using kref?
Why don't you use groups for the attributes?
Why don't you use default attributes for the device, where you get all
error handling done by the core.
