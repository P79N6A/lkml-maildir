After removing kfree(), which was here in the initial implementation,
this function became a thunk which does nothing useful - we can just
stick fn and data directly into work_struct.

Then this becomes:
int execute_in_process_context(void (*fn)(void *data), void *data,
			       struct work_struct *work)
{
	if (!in_interrupt()) {
		fn(data);
		return 0;
	}
	INIT_WORK(work, fn, data);
	schedule_work(work);
	return 1;
}
(and struct execute_work is no longer needed).
