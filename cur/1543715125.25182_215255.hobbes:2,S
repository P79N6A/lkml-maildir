It was pointed out to me that I shouldn't have referred to XF86's 
drivers as 'lousy'.  Let me clarify.  They would be wonderful if ATI 
would provide documentation.  Instead, developers have to stab in the 
dark.  Perhaps I should have said "XFree's drivers based on ATI's lousy 
documentation."
My apologies for being rude.
