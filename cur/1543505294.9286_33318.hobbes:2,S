As I said before I'm trying to get speakfreely to work in full-duplex
mode.
This program has two components (two independent processes) that try to
access /dev/audio. The thing is that during execution they open/close
/dev/audio multiple times so I think that the second method wont work
(correct me if I am wrong).
Can you indicate me some (online) documentation concerning file handle
passing?
Thanks
