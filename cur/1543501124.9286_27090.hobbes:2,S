A serial card costs roughly $20, or for free as "junk" at some
surplus store, or at a garage sale.  I've got a boatload of them
around here.
If the problem you're having is causing downtime, I'll assume
that downtime equals lost money, directly or indirectly.  $20 for
another serial port is peanuts in this case.  A Parallel cable is
also possible too I believe.  I've used PLIP many times and it
works fairly well.
