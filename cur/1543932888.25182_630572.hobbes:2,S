You're wrong.  It would mean that PG_private is the logical disjunction of
PG_fscache and some condition not otherwise explicitly stored.  I tried that
with NFS and it was nasty.
As you can no doubt see, it means that you can't distinguish all the states
you used to be able to.

I think you missed what I said:
	but PG_private is 'owned' by the generic buffer cache code.
That means more of the core code would have to change - or, at least, change
more.
