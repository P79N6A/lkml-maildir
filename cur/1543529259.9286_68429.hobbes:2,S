i disagree with your method; it'll only result in more user complaints
about buggy soft/how to do?/multi list spam.
Another solution  may to do as when one want to compile a driver as a
module when modules support is disabled (warning box). But i'll require
a lot of work (altering all  config programs)
We may also remove the DEVFS support in microcode driver or add in the
doc that it's require devfs.
Or this driver should use an include that provide a layer between
proc/devfs and the driver itself; /proc/cpu/ should be used when there
is no devfs support.
But this is not the _real_ problem, it's only an effect of the devfs vs
procfs debat.
Anyway, for final user, either they'll never see this because either
distro won't provide i686 compiled kernels or they'll provide kernels
for all ia32 cpu AND compile in devfs as it fixes some problems (i'am
thinking of the possibilty to break the 15 fs limit on scsi disks). So
why change this driver ?
