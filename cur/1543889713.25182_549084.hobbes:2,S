Propose a better way to code this then? It's not my fault that dealing with 
callbacks in C is so messy. _here just massages one callback
prototype (smp_call_function's) into another (cpufreq's) because
both callbacks do the same in this case.
The r_s_f BTW stands for resync_sc_freq which is a function earlier 
in the file and should be familiar to a serious reader.
