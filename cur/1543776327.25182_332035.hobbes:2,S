Subject: [PATCH 1/1] cdev: cdev_put oops
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

While fixing an oops in the st driver in a dirty release path,
I encountered an oops in cdev_put for cdevs allocated using
cdev_alloc. If cdev_del is called when the cdev kobject still
has an open user, when the last cdev_put is called, the cdev_put
will call kobject_put, which will end up ultimately releasing the cdev
in cdev_dynamic_release. Patch fixes the oops by preventing cdev_put
from accessing freed memory.
