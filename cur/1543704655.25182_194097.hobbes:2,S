Going off on a tangent...
There are all sorts of potentially-interesting things that could be
done if Linux had a userspace filesystem mechanism included in the
standard kernel -- as well as encryption, there's also network
filesystems, various sorts of specialised caching (such as Zero
Install), automounter-like systems, prototyping and so on.
Is there a technical reason that none of the userspace filesystem
layers have been included in the stock kernel, or is it just that
nobody's submitted any of them for inclusion yet?
