Well, yes. I should have known as I converted so many occurences of
to_video_device to container_of in my second patch.

BTW, just a few V4L2 drivers and videodev seem to use this construct:
  video/usbvision/usbvision-video.c:    container_of(cd, struct video_device, class_dev);
  video/sn9c102/sn9c102_core.c:   cam = video_get_drvdata(container_of(cd, struct video_device,
  video/sn9c102/sn9c102_core.c-                                        class_dev));
  video/videodev.c:       struct video_device *vfd = container_of(cd, struct video_device,
  video/videodev.c-                                               class_dev);
And then their are drivers with other variants of container_of, e.g.:
  video/pvrusb2/pvrusb2-v4l2.c:   vp = container_of(chp,struct pvr2_v4l2,channel);
  video/bt8xx/bttv-vbi.c: struct bttv_buffer *buf = container_of(vb,struct bttv_buffer,vb);
   ...
I think, there should be a to_video_device macro for usage in v4l2.
An most probable for the other container_of stuff (when more there is more
than one occurence of a particular construct), drivers should provide their own macro,
e.g. to_video_buffer() or so.
That's what other subsystems do. It is more self-explanatory than a direct usage
of container_of.
So why not apply (my first patch ... oh no, of course that's  rubbish ;-) 
Linus' below patch for 2.6.23 to fix the compilation for that particular driver.
And to work on the conversion of container_of() stuff to meaningful macros for the
next kernel release?
