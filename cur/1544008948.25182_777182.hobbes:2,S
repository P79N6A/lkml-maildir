Argh, the following one is broken:
 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=558073dd56707864f09d563b64e7c37c021e89d2
so please scratch it and this one is already on your list:
 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=7b4d469228a92a00e412675817cedd60133de38a
The remaining two, ie.
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=65df78473ffbf3bff5e2034df1638acc4f3ddd50
 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=40599072dca3ec7d4c9ff8271978be169f974638
should still be added into the -stable queue IMO.
Thanks,
