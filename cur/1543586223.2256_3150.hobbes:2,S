So? If the requirement is no-overcommit, then assume it WILL be overwritten.
Allocate sufficient swap for the requirement.
Now, it shouldn't be necessary to include the text segment - after all
this should be marked RX.
Actually just X would do, but on Intel systems that also means R. and if W
is set it also means RWX. I hope that Intel gets a better clue about memory
protection sometime soon.
