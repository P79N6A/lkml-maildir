Your suggestion is very valid, since the cpu_notifiers are called only
at init time, unless CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU is turned ON. Definitions of
__cpuinit and __cpuinitdata takes care of HOTPLUG config option.
XFS wants to register only for HOTPLUG_CPU case, and it do so by putting
the callback, register and unregister inside #ifdef HOTPLUG_CPU.
Note: I made the changes and tested, it works.
Andrew, Linus, Any comments ?
