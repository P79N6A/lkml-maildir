this is a common misunderstanding. When switching from thread to thread in
the 1:1 model, most of the cost comes from entering/exiting the kernel. So
*once* we are in the kernel the cheapest way is not to piggyback to
userspace to do some userspace context-switch - but to do it right in the
kernel.
in the kernel we can do much higher quality scheduling decisions than in
userspace. SMP affinity, various statistics are right available in
kernel-space - userspace does not have any of that. Not to talk about
preemption.
