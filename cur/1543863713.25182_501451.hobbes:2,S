Unfortunately, that also massively collides with a giant radeonfb update
that's been simmering on my HD for some time (mostly the work of Solomon
Peachy to support ATOM BIOS and newer cards).
I really need to finish some bits in there and push it out. Dave, you
want to push your stuff first or you prefer re-adapting your stuff on
top of mine ? I'll try to dig a patch to put in -mm for a while next
week.
Ben.
