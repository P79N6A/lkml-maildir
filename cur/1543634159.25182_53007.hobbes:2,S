   This patch replaces the timer_bh with a tasklet.
This is going to break a lot of stuff.
For one thing, the net/core/dev.c:deliver_to_old_ones() code to
disable timers no longer will work.
If you had deleted TIMER_BH you would have noticed this breakage.
Also, aren't there some dependencies on HI_SOFTIRQ being first in
that enumeration?  This needs to be answered before going further
with this patch.
