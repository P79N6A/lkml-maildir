Missing the point; this is an alternative to the previous choices; Choice 
C explicitly removes all remaps ("folding") from mempolicies.  The 
nodemask passed to set_mempolicy() will always have exactly one meaning: 
the system nodes that the policy is intended for.
Cpusets, which are built upon mempolicies, can obviously take access to 
some of those nodes away.  That's why the existing mempolicies are AND'd 
with the cpuset's mems_allowed to represent the current nodemask that the 
mempolicy is effecting.  If none of them are available because of cpusets, 
the mempolicy is invalidated and MPOL_DEFAULT is used.  If access to some 
nodes from the mempolicy's nodemask become available once again, the 
policy is again effected.
I'm arguing that remapping a policy's nodemask, although that is what 
currently is done, is troublesome because it can use a policy such as 
MPOL_PREFERRED to work on a node for which it was never intended.
