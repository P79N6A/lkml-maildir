I added the original check, but I can't remember the reason I
initialized acpi_kbd_controller_present to 1.  Possibly just
timidity.
At the time, it was used in pc_keyb.c to avoid a blind probe.
That usage no longer exists.  i8042 now registers a regular
PNP driver with the appropriate PNP IDs.
Nobody actually uses acpi_kbd_controller_present or
acpi_legacy_devices anymore.  Maybe the best thing is to
just remove both of them.  Then the Keith can add back
the acpi_kbd_controller_present part to the kdb patch if
he decides that's the best route.
ia64: remove unused acpi_kbd_controller_present, acpi_legacy_devices
Nobody uses either one anymore.
