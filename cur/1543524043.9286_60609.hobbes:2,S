  Hi,
  This message is printed by net/udp.c :
    if (usin->sin_family != AF_INET) {
         if (usin->sin_family != AF_UNSPEC)
               return -EINVAL;
         if (net_ratelimit())
            printk("Remind Kuznetsov, he has to repair %s eventually\n", current->comm);
    }
      
  I saw this messages too and what I discovered was:
1) Create an udp socket and bind it to a port and INADDR_ANY
2) Send a mensage to this socket from localhost
3) The first recvfrom returns the sockaddr with address (IP) equal 0
(not 127.0.0.1 or ethernet address) and replying to this request with
this sockaddr causes that printk .
4) Next recvfrom returns sockaddr right.
