I had a lockup on 2.4.24 today, too.
The machine was not pingable (suddenly) and all network
access failed (NFS, SSH).
The box had an uptime of aproximately 20 days.
Machine is a pentium 1 75 Mhz with 48MB Ram.
The bad things are:
- - I have no logs. They got lost when I reset the machine.
- - The kernel was tainted with the fritzcard dsl driver.
  But exact the same driver had uptimes of over 30 days on
  this machine several times in the past.
- - The machine has no peripheral hardware, so I was not
  able to test sysrq, catch dmesg or something like that.
I know, that this mail is not very helpfull, but maybe
better than sending no mail at all. :)
