It is preferable to use a ia64_pal_cache_flush instead of SAL call. But
it hangs the machine with that pal call.  I will look at it tomorrow.
The type argument for sal_cache_flush is: 1 for icache, 2 for dcache,
and 3 for i+d.

Calibration result on ia64 (1.5 GHz, 9 MB), somewhat smaller in this
version compare to earlier estimate of 10.4ms.  The optimal setting
found by a db workload is around 16 ms.
