It would seem that all chips would have off, max, full, etc, but mapping 
nondescript names into functionality may require some chip info anyway. 
As you note, with some chips these are not nice linear points on a line, 
  so it would seem to tell if the top points were "max norm" and "max 
safe" vs. "critical" and "shutdown NOW" is still going to need some 
information on the chip, both points and operating range.
That's an observation, not a complaint, not even a question unless you 
feel the urge to enlighten me.
