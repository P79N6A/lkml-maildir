Since this issue is subject to discussion, i think a consensus can be 
reached, with a discussion with the relevant owners, _if_ it needs to be 
changed. I did not imply that it needs to be changed.
I have personally contributed some code which does EXPORT_SYMBOL, but 
for me changing it to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is acceptable if the general 
consensus is that way, or if there is a valid reason to go either way. I 
don't mind either.

AFAIK, the only hardware that exports EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL is only the 
budget core, other than that all of the code uses EXPORT_SYMBOL only.
