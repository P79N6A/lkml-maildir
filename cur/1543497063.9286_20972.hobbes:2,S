This suggests a particular way of going to a larger dev_t.
I have been using (and am using a kernel like this right now):
static inline kdev_t to_kdev_t(dev_t dev)
{
        int major, minor;
	major = (dev >> 32);
	if (!major) {
		major = (dev >> 16);
		if (!major) {
			major = (dev >> 8);
			minor = (dev & 0xff);
		} else
			minor = (dev & 0xffff);
	} else
		minor = (dev & 0xffffffff);
        return MKDEV(major, minor);
}
I am not aware of any disadvantages of this system,
although, now that I think about it, the fact that
multiple representations yield the same (major,minor)
has both advantages and disadvantages.
So far I have not encountered real problems.
