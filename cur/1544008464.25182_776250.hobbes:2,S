My current idea is to have an explicit list of asm-generic headers
that can act as drop-in replacements, either in include/asm-generic/Makefile
or in arch/*/include/asm/Makefile, and then generate these trivial
wrappers in $(objdir)arch/*/include/asm/ and $(INSTALL_HDR_PATH)/asm
if it doesn't already exist there.
This way we don't have to change all the headers that do #include
<asm-generic/foo.h> plus something else.
