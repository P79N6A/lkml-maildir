 contains a patch for kdb
v1.5-beta2 against 2.4.0-test9-pre7.
Copied to linux-xfs for interest only, XFS will stay on kdb v1.4 until
kdb v1.5 has been better tested.  If nobody complains then this will
become kdb v1.5 some time next week.
This version of kdb has had a lot of internal changes from kdb v1.4 so
it comes with even less warranty than normal.  You may hit problems in
the debugger itself so only apply this patch if you want to explore the
debugger, if you want to do real debugging then stick to kdb v1.4 for
the moment.
Changes from kdb v1.5-beta1.
* Upgrade to 2.4.0-test9-pre7.
* Breakpoints that are set via kdb/kdb_cmds at bootup are now activated
  automatically.  They are also applied to each cpu as it boots so you
  can specify global hardware breakpoints and they will appear on all
  cpus.
* SS and SSB commands have some minor bugs fixes.  The change to only
  release one cpu for ss[b] appears to be working.
* NMI oopser for uniprocessors.  This builds on Keir Fraser's excellent
  patch for activating the local APIC on P6 systems and (ab)uses the
  local APIC to generate NMI on systems which have a local APIC but no
  IO-APIC, typically any P6 and above uniprocessor.  So you poor
  developers with uniprocessors can now get diagnostics when the system
  gets into a spin loop.
  On the Processor configuration menu, select 'APIC and IO-APIC support
  on uniprocessors'.  That option will detect the local APIC if it
  exists.  See the help for 'NMI watchdog active for uniprocessors' and
  Documentation/nmi_watchdog.txt.
* gdb single step sometimes hangs with this version of kdb, probably
  related to the dr7 changes in 2.4.0-test9-pre7.  Under investigation,
  for the moment do not use gdb single stepping.
