IMHO /user/src/linux have nothing to do with glibc headers.
Any half-sanely configured glibc will have all relevant kernel
headers installed under /usr/include/{asm|linux} (most probably copied
from a kernel tree).
The sad fact is that these are symlinks on many systems in Real World.
In short, on sanely configured system you should be able to rm -rf /usr/src,
then untar some $source and configure/build it successfully.
