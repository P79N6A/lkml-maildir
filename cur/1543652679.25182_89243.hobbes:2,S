Really? Last time I checked the ATA spec, C1h comes
out to BSY=80h | DRDY=40h | ERR=1h.
I was *merely* trying to fix the loop on status=C1h, flags=11h.
By the use of flags (error register) and status's bits, I concluded
that while status is not *the* ATA status register, it's bits
are pretty close. For this reason I used the C1h *mask* to make
everyone happy.
Yes, I did assume that it is massaged by the controller,
but with a closed hardware spec and a bug, I had to start
somewhere.
