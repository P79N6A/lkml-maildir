It's great to hear I am not on my own with those problems. If you have
read my source you know that speed changing routine is there and works,
or rather is seemed to work according to the data sheet. What I can't do
now is find a proper way to invoke it and not make the kernel panic. If
I solve this problem only error handling and performace tuning will have
to be done (if no other problems will be born by the way).
Please tell how can I help.
PS. I am simply curious how long did it take you to develope your code
and how many of you have worked on it?
