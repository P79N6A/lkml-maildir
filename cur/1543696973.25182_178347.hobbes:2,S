Subject: 2.6 BK Autoloading of modules regression?

I am using a recent Linux-2.6 (BK) with module-init-tools 0.9.15-pre3.
I cannot autoload some modules in spite of (what I think) correct
configuration.
When I try to access /dev/nst0, I'd like the st module to be loaded.
$ grep char-major-9\  /etc/modprobe.conf
alias char-major-9 st
$ mt -f /dev/nst0 status
mt: No such device. Cannot open '/dev/nst0'.
dmesg reports
"request_module: failed /sbin/modprobe -s -- char-major-9-128. error = -1"
Changing the alias to char-major-9-* or char-major-9* does not help.
The st module is available, a manual modprobe st loads it fine.
This worked with older post-2.6.0-test9 BK kernels with 0.9.15-pre2
module-init-tools.
The other issue I'm having is that apparently the kernel does not even
try to autoload my "scanner" module. I have "alias char-major-180-48
scanner" in modprobe.conf, /dev/usb/scanner0 which is a character special
wit 180,48 is opened, but the module is not loaded. This has always been
the case for 2.6.0-test9 for me.
Did I do something wrong? Is there a kernel or module-init-tools
problem?
