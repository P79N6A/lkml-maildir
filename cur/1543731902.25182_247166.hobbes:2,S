Let me try to summarize the different options regarding BUG_ON, 
concerning whether the argument to BUG_ON might contain side effects, 
and whether it should be allowed in some "do this only if you _really_ 
know what you are doing" situations to let BUG_ON do nothing.
Options:
1. BUG_ON must not be defined to do nothing
1a. side effects are allowed in the argument of BUG_ON
1b. side effects are not allowed in the argument of BUG_ON
2. BUG_ON is allowed to be defined to do nothing
2a. side effects are allowed in the argument of BUG_ON
2b. side effects are not allowed in the argument of BUG_ON
It would be good if there was a decision which of the four choices 
should become documented policy.

My personal opinions:
IMHO, 1b doesn't make much sense, since in the case of 1. side effects 
are never a problem.
IMHO, 2b is bad since it might cause nasty heisenbugs if BUG_ON does  
nothing, and preserving the side effects is easy.
