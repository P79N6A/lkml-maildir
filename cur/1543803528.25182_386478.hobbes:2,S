The irq timeout problem might be broken hardware/firmware, but there
is a problem with drive locking and the pktcdvd driver.
If you do
	pktsetup 0 /dev/hdc
	mount /dev/hdc /mnt/tmp
	umount /mnt/tmp
the door will be left in a locked state. (It gets unlocked when you
run "pktsetup -d 0" though.) However, if you do:
	pktsetup 0 /dev/hdc
	mount /dev/pktcdvd/0 /mnt/tmp
	umount /mnt/tmp
the door will be properly unlocked.
The problem is that the cdrom driver locks the door the first time the
device is opened in blocking mode, but doesn't unlock it again until
the open count goes down to zero. The pktcdvd driver tries to work
around that, but it can't do it in the first example because the
mount/umount commands do not involve the pktcdvd driver at all.
