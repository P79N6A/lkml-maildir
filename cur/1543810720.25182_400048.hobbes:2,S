So then the statement is that debugfs is for _ALL_ kinds of debugging,
including application debugging. IOW, anyone considering debugfs as
an fs exclusive to kernel-developers is WRONG. IOW2, distros should
_NOT_ shy away from enabling debugfs by default on their production
kernels.
Right?
Just want to make sure this is clear as it has been my impression
all along (and it seems that of others out there), and I may have
very well been wrong, that debugfs is solely for kernel developers.
Thanks,
Karim
