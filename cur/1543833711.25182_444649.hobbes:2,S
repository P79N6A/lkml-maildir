We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.16.26 kernel.
This should fix the reported issue of NetworkManager dying when using
the 2.6.16.25 kernel release.  All users of the 2.6.16 kernel are
recommended to upgrade to this kernel, as it fixes a publicly known
security issue that can provide root access to any local user of the
machine.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.16.25 and 2.6.16.26, as it is small enough to do so.
The updated 2.6.16.y git tree can be found at:
 	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.16.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
	www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
greg k-h
