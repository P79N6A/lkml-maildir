I was only able to scrounge 5 minutes on this system this morning.
Here's the last few messages output with initcall_debug on:
Calling initcall .... init+0x0/0xc()
Calling initcall .... noop_init+0x0/0xc()
io scheduler noop registered
Calling initcall .... as_init+0x0/0x4f()
io scheduler anticipatory registered (default)
Calling initcall .... deadline_init+0x0/0x4f()
io scheduler deadline registered
Calling initcall .... cfq_init+0x0/0xcc()
io scheduler cfq registered
Calling initcall .... pci_init+0x0/0x2b()
What other info can I grab? (Although I have to fit in with that
system's production schedule so I may not be able to come back with that
until later on today/tomorrow).
