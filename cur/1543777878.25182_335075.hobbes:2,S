Not really... You know, I am reviewing the 2.6.12 patch and don't really
see anything that might have caused the problem you are describing. I know
that not all devices on pass-through ports are broken since I have one
(not TrackPoint, just a simple eraser head pointer) and I make sure it
works ;)
When you are talking about reading secondary ID, are you talking about
TP_READ_ID or something else?
Are you experiencing the breakage yourself? It might be interesting to
see the log with i8042 debugging turned on.
