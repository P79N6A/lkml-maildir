Mike,
      I have implemented such a bridge in Linux for modem testing 
purposes.  I have also implemented a bridge between Ethernet (Clear TCP) 
and serial ports.
      You really, really want to do this in user space.
      Putting it in the kernel sounds like a great idea, but the truth is 
that you aren't going to do much better there than you would in user 
space.  At 115,200 bits/s, you get a character no faster than once every 87 
microseconds.  Some facts:
1)  The 16550A UART is designed to minimize interrupts.  This means that, 
depending on how the driver is written, that you will see interrupts after 
a latency.  For example, with the FIFO threshold set at eight, you will get 
the interrupt anywhere from between 348 microseconds and 609 microseconds 
after the receipt of the first character in the FIFO.
In other words, you now have a 1/2 millisecond latency caused by the 
hardware itself.
2)  There are portions of the Linux kernel that run with interrupts 
inhibited, so that when this code is run the interrupt response time is 
going to be extended anyway.  So even if you had a kernel solution, you 
will see the box add latency.
3)  The only time a kernel solution would make sense is if there is a 
significant applications load running in the Linux box.
If your goal is to monitor lines, then I suggest you use a Y-cable to do 
so, and not interpose the Linux box in the middle.
