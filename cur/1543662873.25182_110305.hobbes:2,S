woo hoo!  Thanks much.  I was sorta hoping you would step in and help 
out with the kbuild issues ;-)

FWIW, this should be ok for testing, but not a merge...  we need to have 
a single "do_mounts" code flow, not two code paths that are selected 
with a switch.
That's why I see a lot of little klibc binaries, especially initially. 
Moving piece-by-piece from do_mounts.c (and other places) to userspace 
takes longer, but really maximizes both stability and testing of new code.
