Thanks, that's really nice.
I'd assumed `kern_mount' was similar to mounting a normal filesystem,
but in a non-existent namespace.  Traditionally in unix you can't
unmount a filesystem when its in use, and mounts don't disappear when
the last file being used on them disappears.
But you've rather cutely arranged that these kinds of mount _do_
disappear when the last file being used on them disappears.  Clever, if
a bit disturbing.
