Actually, if you look closely, there is an OOPS report in there at the
end as well.  Unfortunately, since the tasklist output also looks like
an OOPS, it is basically impossible to extract.

You can see it says "NMI Watchdog detected LOCKUP on CPU 0, registers:"

It may be that if the tasklist is too long, and it runs with interrupts
disabled, that this will trigger the NMI watchdog timer.  Since I don't
know anything about the console, I can't help.
