Subject: [PATCH] Fixes and enhancements for the MMC SPI driver - revised
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
thanks to all contributors who have reviewed my patch, especial to 
Andrew Morton for pointing out some problems.
Here is a revised patch incl. changelog. I have though about putting
some warnings in the message log with printk, Pierre. But this is low-level
stuff and will likely flood the logfile.
This patch will change the status of the MMC SPI driver from "works NOT 
for the majority of SD cards" to "works for the majority of SD cards".
changelog:
o  Release CPU time to other tasks in mmc_spi_skip() if busy waiting is longer
   than a scheduling period. Otherwise the whole userspace will lock until the
   SD card is not busy any more (maybe 900ms). ktime converted to jiffies to
   match the scheduling periods.
o  Wait a little bit longer (16 Bytes instead of 8) in mmc_spi_response_get()
   to read the response code from the SD card. Some SD cards are slower than
   the standard allows; especially if the card is internally writing data to
   flash.
o  Rise the write block timeout to a minimum of 1s in mmc_spi_writeblock().
   Some cards - even SDHC! - need longer timeouts if they are pushed to the
   limit (back-to-back write transfers, blocksize < than internal flash block
   size). This may be enforced by the small cluster size of FAT32 volumes.
o  Some SD cards are not able to send the response code after a write data
   block in time if they are internal busy flushing data to NAND. Allow for
   max. 27 bit offset in mmc_spi_writeblock(). (The highest observed delay
   was 12 bits).
o  Omit the CRC check for all non-data-reads (CID and CSD) in 
   mmc_spi_readblock(). Some cards send wrong CRC if len != MMC_SPI_BLOCKSIZE.
o  Allow the platform data to specify SPI_MODE_3, overriding the default
   SPI_MODE_0. This is for SPI hardware which is not able to drive Chip Select
   correctly in SPI mode 0 (Blackfin).
