These are othogonal problems.
IS_NOCMTIME is the filesystem's way of saying that it doesn't need
->setattr on truncate(), write(), etc.  Why?  Because it can do the
[cm]time change implicitly _within_ the operation.
If IS_NOCMTIME is set, the only place where the filesystem should get
ATTR_MTIME or ATTR_CTIME (and for that matter ATTR_MTIME_SET) is from
sys_utime[s].
