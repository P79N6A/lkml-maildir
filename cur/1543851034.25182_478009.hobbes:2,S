That is fair question. I got that conclusion by a quick test with
"memmap=" and kernel did not boot. :)
Now think about it, it could be because the loader  (or the real-mode
part of kernel) has not been modified to deal with the initial gap.
Can someone confirm that and give some hints on how to do this?
Thanks.
