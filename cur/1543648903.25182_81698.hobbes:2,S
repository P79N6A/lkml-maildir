I think it's a client issue. NFS servers don't care about cogestion of UDP
traffic and they will try to response to all NFS requests as fast as they can.
You can try to increase the number of clients or the number of mount points
for a test. It's easy to mount the same directory of the server on some
directries of the client so that each of them can work simultaneously.
   # mount -t nfs server:/foo   /baa1
   # mount -t nfs server:/foo   /baa2
   # mount -t nfs server:/foo   /baa3
Thank you,
Hirokazu Takahashi.
