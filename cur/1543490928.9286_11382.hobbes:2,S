Hello all.
I'm writing a Linux driver for the new Octoport multiport (4/8) rs232 PCI
board (saled by Computer Modules, Inc. 
http://www.compumodules.com/
).
Computer Modules SUPPORTS this work (providing me all necessary resources),
and maybe it will support moreother in the future.
At this moment, the driver development is at the initial phase (board detection
and configuration), but I believe a major number for the associated devices
is needed. Do I have to ask Peter Anvin <hpa@zytor.com> (maintainer of
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/devices.txt)?
I hope this work can be useful for various users and goals.
My best regards, Massimo
