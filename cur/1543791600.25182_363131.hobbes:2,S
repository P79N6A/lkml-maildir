Your basic fault is in believing that the free watermark would stay 
constant.
That's insane.
Would you keep 8MB free on a 64MB system?
Would you keep 8MB free on a 8GB system?
The point being, that if you start with insane assumptions, you'll get 
insane answers.
The _correct_ assumption is that you aim to keep some fixed percentage of 
memory free. With that assumption and your math, finding higher-order 
pages is equally hard regardless of amount of memory. 
Now, your math then doesn't allow for the fact that buddy automatically 
coalesces for you, so in fact things get _easier_ with more memory, but 
hey, that needs more math than I can come up with (I never did it as math, 
only as simulations with allocation patterns - "smart people use math, 
plodding people just try to simulate an estimate" ;)
