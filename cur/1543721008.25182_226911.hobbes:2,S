Grrr.  I was testing on a fairly generic kernel configuration which
did not include fast_clear_page()...
If the FPU state belong to the userspace process, kernel_fpu_begin()
is safe even if some exceptions are pending.  However, after
__clear_fpu() the FPU is "orphaned", and kernel_fpu_begin() does
nothing with it.
Replacing fwait with fnclex instead of removing it completely should
avoid the fault later.  However, looks like we really need the proper
fix - teach do_coprocessor_error() to recognize kernel mode faults and
fixup them.
