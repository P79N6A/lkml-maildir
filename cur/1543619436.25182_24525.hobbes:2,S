Standard ia32 references, i.e., at Intel's website. Beware, it is some 500
pages PDF. But they (and standard PC assembly books) use the nearly
unreadable Intel syntax with operands the other way around, so this is much
less of a help than it could be.
Has anyone gotten a instruction listing (just instructions and short
description, not the whole other stuff in there), preferably in AT&T
syntax?
