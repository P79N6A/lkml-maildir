With nproc, tool authors won't need to write any special-casing code
for non-MMU. All they need to handle is the possibility that a field
they ask for does not exist. (Of course it doesn't hurt if they know
how to deal with non-MMU specific fields if any exist)

It seems we all agree on that.
What I'd object to is offering fields like Size, Exe, etc. and filling
them with values that are wrong (e.g. returning always 0 for Exe). In
such a case, the field is simply not offered and asking for it an
error.
That's not a problem we can solve for tool authors: Allowing them to
distinguish between N/A and 0 is a property of the interface, and using
that interface means knowing how to deal with that distinction.
