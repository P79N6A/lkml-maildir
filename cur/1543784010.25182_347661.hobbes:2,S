Sure it is! It just isn't the GNU flavor of open source. It's likely
that it's even "compatible" as long as it's not more restrictive
than GNU.
Often the "GNU protestants" are rejecting perfectly good work because
they have adopted a highly restrictive religion, having been taught
that it is the true meaning of freedom. Marx would be so proud!
Wonderful thing about published private works, i.e., proprietary
source-code, is that you can use it as a reference and write your
own version(s). Since it's published, you don't need "clean-room"
techniques. You just can't grab portions "whole cloth" and paste
them into your source.
When your driver, probably with improvements, is finished it
is normal, but not necessary to provide some attribution in the
source such as "Adapted from xxx.yyy.zzz" as a public "thank you".
