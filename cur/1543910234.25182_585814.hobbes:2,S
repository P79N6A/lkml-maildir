I maintain the sky2 driver, and have one of the (buggy) Gigabyte motherboards.
It is interesting that the problem seems to track with video card.
Are you using the Nvidia binary driver?
The video card in the system I have troubles with is:
	ATI Technologies Inc RV370 [Radeon X300SE]
Surprisingly, using other PCI-E cards with same driver (different Marvell chips)
has no problem.  Vendor version of sk98lin driver has same failure mode
on the buggy hardware.
You might want to look at lspci -vvv output on two system to see if there
are differences. Perhaps there is a CPU speed dependency?
