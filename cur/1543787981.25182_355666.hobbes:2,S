Hi Linus,
Here is a (tested) patch to remove the setting of ATTR_CTIME in
do_truncate() as you suggested.

Having gone through looking at ext2/3 and having made ntfs_truncate()
behave the same way as ext2/3_truncate() wrt m/ctime, I now agree with
you.  do_truncate() should only set ATTR_SIZE, not ATTR_CTIME.  The file
system will set ATTR_CTIME and ATTR_MTIME anyway so it's a waste for the
attribute to also set ATTR_CTIME.  That way it happens twice.
Below is a patch to remove it...
Best regards,
        Anton
