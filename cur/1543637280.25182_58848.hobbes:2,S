Subject: Errors in 2.4.19-rc3 CML rules (SiS related)

Hello.  I encountered some errors in the 2.4.19-rc3 CML rules.
It took a little while to track down, but I finally know what's
going on:
  1) CONFIG_DRM_SIS needs to require CONFIG_FB_SIS_315.
      Currently, you can select CONFIG_DRM_SIS without CONFIG_FB_SIS_315.
      If you do that, you get undefined symbol errors for sis_malloc and
         sis_free.
  2) CONFIG_FB_SIS must be compiled into the kernel (i.e. NOT a module).
      Currently, you can compile it as a module.
      If you do that, you ALSO get undefined symbol errors for
         sis_malloc and sis_free.
These requirements could be enforced with CML rules.  Before I
submit the patch to do this, I'd like to know if that's the proper
fix!  Would it be better to just make CONFIG_FB_SIS able to be built
as a module instead?
Thanks for any help.
