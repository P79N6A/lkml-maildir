The aic79xx driver shat itself.
The log buffer starts with
scsi1 (4:0): rejecting I/O to offline device
scsi1 (4:0): rejecting I/O to offline device

So we've probably lost the info which will tell us how the problems
started.  A serial console would be nice.

Are all the failures due to the aic79xx driver failing in this manner?  If
not then please report the different failures separately, thanks.
