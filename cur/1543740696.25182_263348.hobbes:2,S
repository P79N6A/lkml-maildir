Modify the V4L2 API by adding the correct generic interface.

At least two: w9968cf, ov511.

No, it's not easy for me to say that: the w9968cf driver is not really usefull
without the optional module available *outside* the kernel, since native UYVY
is not supported in userland at all. Furthermore, having had a separate module
for these things, is one more reason why none never patched any of the existing
applications.
Another example: sometime ago I had to patch the V4L2 API to add Bayer format
support to V4L2. This saved me from implementing colorspace conversion in the
sn9c102 driver. The patch was *one line* long and one of its results is that
now someone is working on gnomemeeting/pwlib to implement Bayer-to-* color
conversions that will make thousands of webcams work on Linux with this
application.
