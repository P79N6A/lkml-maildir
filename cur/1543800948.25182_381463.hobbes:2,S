Hello all! Hi Jens!
I'd be kind if you would cc me in case you reply as I'm not (yet)
subscribed to this list.

Hi Jens,
I did as you said and disabled dma:
/dev/hdc:
 IO_support   =  1 (32-bit)
 unmaskirq    =  1 (on)
 using_dma    =  0 (off)
 keepsettings =  0 (off)
 readonly     =  0 (off)
 readahead    = 256 (on)
 HDIO_GETGEO failed: Invalid argument
Then I reripped the whole disc. Now this is remarkable. The rip still
has errors, but the errors are not only in the same tracks. They are
exactly the same errors (md5sums are equal to the ones I yielded from
using ide-cd before):

I used the wav compare function in EAC.

I'm sorry if this isn't what you had in mind when you told me to compare
the wav files. If it doesn't help what can I do to compare the files to
your liking?
