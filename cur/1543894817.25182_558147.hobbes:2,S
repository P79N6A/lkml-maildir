For the architecture we use (Blackfin), it does not support unaligned 
accesses, and we purposely never put in the trap/fixup code - we trap, and 
printk("fix your source");
We have run into a few kernel issues (never networking) this way - but a fixup 
of the source is normally the best solution - since it doesn't impose a 
hidden performance issue by trapping everything all the time.

Is there something specific that you can think of that we should be testing?
We have done alot of testing, and people have shipped alot of systems 
connected to a varity of networks, and have run all kinds of protocols on 
them.
