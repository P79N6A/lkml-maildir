Common misconception.  Even Al Viro fell for it, even though it was he
who wrote the code :)
What is not allowed is that the _new_ mountpoint is in a different
namespace.  The _old_ mount can actually come from a different
namespace or a detached mount in a bind (not an rbind though).
Again experimentally verified.
The check_mnt() function is not a security measure, rather a locking
measure.  Current code in namespace protects modification of the mount
tree with current->namespace->sem.  The check_mnt() calls are needed,
so that the namespace to be modified is really the current namespace.
This limitation can actually be removed.  See patch by Ram Pai posted
earlier in this thread:
  http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111683338801090&w=2
The code can be generalized for other types of mounts, not just bind.
With that and allowing access to /proc/self/fd/*, I think we'll have a
proper interface for passing mounts between namespaces.
The mount groups idea is orthogonal to this I think, and I'll send
comments in a separate mail.
