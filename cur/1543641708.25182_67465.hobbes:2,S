Is coping between user and kernel spaces so bad? As you pointed
out there are problems with only user space implementation.

Yes. But I don't see what is wrong with our system? Our queues _don't_
vanish with creator exit. (Our add on to exit() (and fork) is to keep
track of processes that have opened mqueue. Then mq_unlink() can
postpone deleting queue to the time when it isn't opened by anyone)

To this I answer in an answer to your next post :)

I don't fully understand it. Can you explain it in more details?
