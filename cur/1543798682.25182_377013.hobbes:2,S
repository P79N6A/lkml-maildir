I'm glad it helped. :-)

Mh, that's just the same phenomenon one always sees with web sites. If 
some data structure, be it a file system or an HTML-like tag soup, 
doesn't conform to the specification, the processors (fs driber or web 
browser) behavoiur will be implementation dependant... One specific error 
will break one implementation but not the other, while another error will 
just cause the opposite, there may be implementations which are more 
sensitive to specification violation and so on...
So the behaviour you observed is not that surprising, after all. ;)

Well, as I understood it this message just stated that the fs driver was 
confused and blocked write access for safety reasons, to avoid further 
damage.
It had nothing to do with a "kernel panic" or similar.
