I don't think it's the "same instruction". Looking at the pattern, I think
that a "mov->ss" always checks interrupts _before_ it executes, and never 
checks interrupts _after_ it executes.
So I think the pattern is (for your athlon64):
 - regular instructions check interrupts before they execute, _except_ if 
   the "dontcheck" flag was set. They clear "dontcheck" after execution.
 - "mov->ss" always checks interrupts before it executes, regardless of
   "dontcheck". It always sets "dontcheck".
 - "sti" sets "dontcheck" if interrupts were disabled before.
So you can get two-instruction holes by doing the sequence
	/* interrupts disabled */
	mov->ss
	sti
	/* any instruction except cli/mov->ss */
but no other combination (series of "mov->ss" will always check _before_
each "mov->ss", and series of "sti" will obviously only have interrupts 
disabled for the _first_ sti).
And I suspect this is very much micro-architecture-dependent, although the 
Athlon64 rules seem very simple and straightforward.
