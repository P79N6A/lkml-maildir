Hmm, I did reproduce this:
$mkdir -p /var/kernels/src/linux-2.6.15 && cd /var/kernels/src/linux-2.6.15
$tar xjf /usr/portage-distfiles/linux-2.6.15.tar.bz2
$make allyesconfig
$ find . -name Kconfig|xargs  egrep -h "depends on m | && m" -B2
config SOUND_WAVEFRONT
        tristate "Full support for Turtle Beach WaveFront (Tropez Plus,
Tropez, Maui) synth/soundcards"
        depends on SOUND_OSS && m && OBSOLETE_OSS_DRIVER
--
config HOSTESS_SV11
        tristate "Comtrol Hostess SV-11 support"
        depends on WAN && ISA && m && ISA_DMA_API

        tristate "NE2000/NE1000 support"
        depends on NET_ISA || (Q40 && m) || M32R

config HYSDN
        tristate "Hypercope HYSDN cards (Champ, Ergo, Metro) support (module

        depends on m && PROC_FS && PCI && BROKEN_ON_SMP

        tristate "DIVA Maint driver support"
        depends on ISDN_DIVAS && m
--
config PCMCIA_AHA152X
        tristate "Adaptec AHA152X PCMCIA support"

config PCMCIA_NINJA_SCSI
        tristate "NinjaSCSI-3 / NinjaSCSI-32Bi (16bit) PCMCIA support"
        depends on m && !64BIT
So there are things that have to be build as modules??
Didn't know that...

You can try `make allyesconfig` but that will produce huge kernel.
Try better `make allmodconfig` and then manually edit some important stuff
like IDE to be built in. Or use initrd.
BTW, what is G4L ?
