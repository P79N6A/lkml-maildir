I think the constraint set should be applied when we add to a group, if
when we add a counter to the group, the result isn't schedulable
anymore, we should fail the group addition - and thereby the counter
creation.
This would leave us with groups that are always schedulable in an atomic
fashion.
>From what I understand the code RRs groups (co-scheduling groups where
possible) (ungrouped counter is a group of one), this means that with
the above addition you'd have the needed control over things.
If you need things to be atomic, create a single group, if you're fine
with RR time-sharing, create multiple.
This seems to leave a hole where multiple monitors collide and create
multiple groups unaware of each-other - could we plug this hole with a
group attribute?
