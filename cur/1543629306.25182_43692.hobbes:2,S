sure, the only issue is the API that the hardware provides to advertise
the start/end of the memory for each node. It doesn't matter if it's
squashed or not as long as you still know the start/end of the phys ram
per node. It also won't make any difference with nonlinear or
discontigmem because you need to fill the pgdat anyways to enable the
numa heuristics (node-affine-allocations being the most sensible etc..).
