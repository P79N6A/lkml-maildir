With a new logic I now know when somebody have an fs lock held from under
me, thus I can skip the write in such cases.
However I see that if some filesystem down() a private lock needed by the
write(shared_file) path and then it generate a page fault it may deadlock
too. So checking down() in the filesystems (and not only in the VFS) will
be necessary. Then the fs will also be free to allocate with GFP_KERNEL
even in places that may be run with some lock held. So I can also return
to allocate the buffer cache with GFP_KERNEL and that's a good thing as
far I can tell.

Ok, but then we should drop the hacks that we have in 2.2.17pre9 to try to
fix this and declare MAP_SHARED allocations not relaible. I voted for this
at first (and that's what I did in 2.2.17pre6aa2) but I got this:

Marcelo told me the unstable patch he was referring to is the
00_shrink_mmap-noblock-2 patch where I dropped the stuff that tried to
avoid mmap002 to fail.
One part of the real problem is that all the VM become dirty at once
because we're not able to account for it. This is mostly a performance
issue because we should be able to handle a VM full of dirty pages. (since
if half of the memory is free and the other half is dirty we could eat the
free part in a hurry and so we could fallback in the current scenario with
all the VM dirty even when we'll fix that problem, it will be more unlkely
to happen but still possible)
But the other part of the problem is realted to shrink_mmap and kpiod.
It's not enough to make shrink_mmap smart in blocking when necessary since
kpiod seems as well involved into the problem since it won't do any write
throttling but it will return "success" unconditionally. But the page
isn't freeable yet, the buffers aren't yet been allocated and there will
be nothing to shrink in the cache even if we just returned success. If we
do some write throttling in shrink_mmap we should quite naturally do some
write throttling also in filemap_swapout, no?

If it will try to do a memory allocation it will never recurse on
try_to_free_pages because PF_MEMALLOC is set.

loop on top of ext2 could deadlock. This can be solved by the new logic
too (since if we have any fs lock held while doing the allocation we could
skip the wait_on_buffer/ll_rw_block and so potential
run_task_queue(&tq_disk) then). However I noticed that some usage of
GFP_BUFFER is meant really only to avoid blocking (and generating new
buffer heads in the buffer head allocation case), thus I think I was wrong
in suggesting to block even if the GFP_IO bitflag is clear.
