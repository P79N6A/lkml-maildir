hm, so we simulate IO errors by failing at make_request() time rather than
at end_that_request_last()-time, which is where IO errors would usually be
reported.
If we're testing the filesystem/VFS/etc layers then that's pretty much
equivalent.  But perhaps there's an argument for doing both.
Jens, could you have a think about it please?
