I for one don't give a damn.  Bugs and how fast this development model
fix them aren't a concern to me; although I'd never slow down the bug
fixing process.  My concern is getting a real stable tree for various
maintainers to base on, so that various patches for drivers, security
enhancements, and other things aren't scattered across versions and
impossible to patch together even when they're noninvasive to eachother.
Have you stopped to consider that the features that are critical to me
are also holding me back from upgrading to the newer kernels?
Ironically, these are security features, and the newer kernels have
newer security fixes aside from new schedulers and other toys I could
really enjoy having around.
