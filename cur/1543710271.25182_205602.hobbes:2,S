Hi,
I just wanted to report that cdrtools-2.01a27 seems to works well
with the new 2.6.4 kernel via ide-cd but there is a tricky thing
to know in order to compile the package, I had to use:
make COPTX='-Du8=UInt8_t -D__attribute_const__=__const__'
..to succeed compiling the libscg and so the binaries.
The first macro apply to linux/include/scsi/scsi.h and the
second to linux/include/asm-i386/byteorder.h
The burning process was OK for me but I would like to know if
 there is possibly some bad side effects and why __const__ was changed for __attribute_const__ (yeah, I don't know the difference and I'm curious ;-)
I post this because I think it will maybe help some people that want to switch to a 2.6 and burn some CD quickly.
Regards,
Jerome Pinot
