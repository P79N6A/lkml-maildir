Ok great this explain things, so perhaps my last hack attempt of not
accounting the unstable pages in the "nr_reclaimable" isn't needed.
What about Valids, were you using jfs too along with ext3? If a single
fs has a bug the loop can happen (it could happen in mainline too,
except it was less likely to be visible there).
Note Valids, your smtp server bounces back my emails.
