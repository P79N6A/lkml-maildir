Ted,
I took a quick look at the tg3 driver and that timer interrupt as well
have read this thread.  My suggestion would be to separate that tg3_timer
into 4 different timers, which is what it actually looks like.  One I
believe (the first one) is an actual timeout and the other three are
timers that are expected to be triggered everytime (watchdog like: at 1
second, 2 seconds and 3 seconds) and thus should be converted into a
hrtimers that goes off when expected then having some crazy accounting
thing in one timer.
I don't fully understand the ASF part here, and if it definitely needs to
go off then set that timer  with the highest prio.  I've ask Thomas to
add a way to add a hrtimer with a given prio instead of always taking the
current->normal_prio.  But until he does that, you can do a hack of
changing the current prio to something very high (like 99) then start the
timer, and then lower the prio back to what it was.  This is a hack, but
it might lead to a better solution in the future.
