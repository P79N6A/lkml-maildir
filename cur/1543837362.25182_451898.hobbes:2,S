I love senselessness and technical incompetence of the document.
As I was taught at school, to prove that a statement is wrong one
has to prove that it is wrong once.
Regardless of what the document says stable ABI can be achieved
today - run a chosen Linux kernel version + chosen ALSA version under XEN or
similar, and assign sound card to these (chosen Linux kernel version +
chosen ALSA version).
Redirect sound ('ncat' + friends) to this (chosen Linux kernel version +
chosen ALSA version) from your kernel in which developers refuse
to ensure stable ABI.
Because of the chosen (kernel+ALSA) you have stable ABI regardless
of what Documentation/stable_api_nonsense.txt says and ALSA + kernel
developers think.
