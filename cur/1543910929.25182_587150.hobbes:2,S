Note the P4 is a extreme case in that "unusual" instructions are
quite slow (basically anything that falls out of the trace cache). Core2 
tends to be much more benign and generally acts more like a K8 in latencies.
There are millions and millions of P4s around of course and we
shouldn't disregard them, but they're not the future and not
highest priority.
