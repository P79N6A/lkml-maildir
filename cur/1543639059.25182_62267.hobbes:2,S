Integers are 32 bit, so a 512 byte disk block contains 128 such integers...
Indeed, All the values above are divisible by 128, so you have:
11668992/128 = 91164 blocks of "0x00000002"
231168/128 = 1806 blocks of "0x00000003"
1174528/128 = 9176 blocks of "0x00000002"
32512/128 = 254 blocks of "0x00000003"
This does not prove, neither disprove anything about your
main concern, that writes are non-atomic in the block level.

I would not expect writes to be in order.
A simple elevator algorithm could write fragments (cylinder sized?)
in reverse order. On-disk write scheduling could start writing at any
sector (to minimize rotational latency).
Knowing the disk geometry and parameters could help with understanding
your results.
