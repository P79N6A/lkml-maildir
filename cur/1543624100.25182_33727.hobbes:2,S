IIRC that was a feature in systems from DEC even before
VMS (I'm talking about the late 70's).  eg. file.txt;2 was revision 2
of file.txt.
I don't know if this feature was in the file-system or in the text editor
that I have used.
The basic features were not even close to what you get from RCS or
SCCS.

That's a different topic, and it depends on system's design. Distributed
filesystem may use some form of a file's version to control the caching
(or locking) of data. In that case just any monotonic value will do.
All the version control systems that I know use file granularity version
numbers (or tags), while for distributed file systems you may want to use
anything between single block and full directory granularity - depending
on the typical access patterns.
There are some recent discussions in the Linux Kernel mailing list
about adding "undelete" and ACL features. Well.. I think of "undelete"
as the most primitive form of a version control (you keep one version back).
Add support for extended attributes (where you can store some extra
metadata) and the rest can be done in the VFS layer. Still far away
from a full featured SCM...
