I have also noticed problems with the 2.4.3 release. I have a G450
32Mb, that I use in single-head mode. The console framebuffer runs
fine at boot time, but when I load X (4.0.3 compiled with Matrox HAL
library) and then return to the console, I get a blank screen (signal
lost).
I don't know what the problem is. I can confirm with Mythos that
under
2.4.2 it was working just fine :-)
Petr Vandrovec is the man who knows... what do you say Petr?!
