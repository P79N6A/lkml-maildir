I did not measure it myself, but rumors were they took tens of cycles.
Well, a IFcc prefix meaning 'execute next instruction if' would be
way more cool that CMOVcc. Because I want CADDcc, CTESTcc, CBSWAPcc too ;)
But since all 1 byte opcodes are taken and
	Jcc	skip		# <- 2 byte opcode
	opcode	op1,op2
skip:
I think some CPU magic can detect such short jumps and handle'em just like
they were such a prefix, saving potential branch (mis-)prediction.
