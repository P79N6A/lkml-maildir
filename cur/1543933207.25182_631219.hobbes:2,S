well, maybe i got unlucky, this hackbench thing being the first time i'm 
exposed to a major SLUB regression. The hackbench problem was dead easy 
to reproduce, i (and others) offered immediate testing of whatever test 
patches, it also matched the profiles of the TPC-C regression but still 
i was only offered explanations about why this workload does not matter 
and how others suck because they are unable to give immediate test 
feedback from millions-of-dollars test equipment that is barely able to 
run our devel kernels. The regression is fixed now and i'm a happy 
camper!
Christoph, i'd like to apologize for all overly harsh words i said. (and 
i said quite a few :-/ )
