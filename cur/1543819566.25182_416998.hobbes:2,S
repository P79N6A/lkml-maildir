My brain is small, and my eyes glaze over easily... ;)
What happens for the following sequence:
a) Process A does   fd = open("/some/protected");
b) Somebody then does an unlink("/some/protected");
c) A then does a fork/exec, handing the exec'ed process B the open FD 
as its stdin.
What name do you use to re-validate B's access to the data described by
the inode that open file is referencing?
Note that although B can't get any access to the data that A didn't have,
it can still be used to bypass security, because B may be able to *copy* that
data to an area where A couldn't write (presumably because A is in a confined box).
This can be mitigated by saying "A can't fork/exec" - which may not work if
A in fact needs to exec things (webserver CGI comes to mind).  I don't see
any provision for saying "A can only exec B, C, and D and nothing else..."
