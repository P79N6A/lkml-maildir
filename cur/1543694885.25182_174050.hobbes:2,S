But flush_workqueue() will ignore any newly-added work requests:
 * This function will sample each workqueue's current insert_sequence number and
 * will sleep until the head sequence is greater than or equal to that.  This
 * means that we sleep until all works which were queued on entry have been
 * handled, but we are not livelocked by new incoming ones.
Now, flush_workqueue() is potentially inefficient on SMP because it flushes
each CPU's workqueue sequentially.  But we can fix that in
flush_workqueue() by converting it to a two-pass approach:
a) gather each CPU's insert_sequence number into a local array[NR_CPUS]
b) wait until each CPU's remove_sequence number exceeds the previously-gathered
   insert_sequence number.
