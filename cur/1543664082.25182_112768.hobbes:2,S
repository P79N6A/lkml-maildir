It's easy to say that people don't need a multiple Ghz processor to run
most applications (games and AI aside) because it's true.  But human
nature is such that people bought muscle cars with way more horsepower
than needed in the 60's and 70's before environmental concerns
intervened.  The current slowdown in PC purchases may be more due to a
cyclical bear market than due to satiation of need.  When the economy
turns around, and it always does, many people will opt for the $600 2.4
Ghz P4 instead of the $200 1.1 Ghz Duron.  And not because they need it,
but because of other factors.
Now, fast forward five years.  If AMD is still around, Intel will be
forced to offer ridiculously fast hardware just to stay in business.  My
original point is that the Ghz race may be supplemented by a SMP/HT
race, not because of need (AI and games may help provide an excuse), but
because of greed and envy.  Never underestimate those last two.  And
that SMP/HT race could have an important impact on future kernel design.
Steven (Looking forward to his 2.4 Ghz P4 which will compile a 2.5
kernel faster than the 15 minutes it takes his 450 Mhz PIII today,
especially with Reiser4 patched in.;) )
