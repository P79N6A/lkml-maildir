Hi,
Even with the Andrea/Monchil patch applied against 2.4.17-rc1, i'm still
hitting the loopback deadlock. Doing a 'cp -a' to a loop device leaves cp
and the loop kernel thread in D state.
I don't know if it's useful, but i did a strace of cp, and the process is
deadlocked in a mkdir call. Sometimes, a 'sync' finish the deadlock, other
times sync also hangs:
[...]
589 tty1     S      0:00 bash
594 ?        DW<    0:00 [loop0]
620 tty1     D      0:00 sync
And a reboot is the only way to kill the tasks.
Thanks
David Gómez
