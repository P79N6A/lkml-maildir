Heh, if userspace writes more than kernel's buffer size, what happens?
We suddenly stopped to trust userspace? What if modprobe itself will do
that? Do not differentiate bugs by the nature of not-bad and bad-enough:
we do not trust userspace, even init, and it looking at the very end of
the mail you will find again why this loading crap is a kernel problem.

Apparently just reading the code does not magically fix kernel problems.
What's the cosmic rays should initird check when it is asked by kernel
to load the module? It tries to load it, which in turn tries to load it
again. Since initird does not use libastral yet, it is up to kernel to
decide what to load and when to ask userspace about that.

Registering purely software class device not being backed by real
hardware since appropriate buses are not yet available? Apparently I
know how to fix this problem: I will write a simple console driver
called 'prayer', which will just sacrifice a little CPU's heat to the
Raa-god when anyone tries to write something to console. And this driver
will later be replaced with real console. Ooops, doesn't above patch
from Kay do the same?

It will not infinitely try to load module, which tries to load itself
again via obscure kernel pathes, return error and continue.
I remind again: all console/tty stuff in my setup is built-in, so there
should be no module request at all, but since earlier registered code
does not know that, kernel believes that console is somewhere in the
module. Having dumb device registered first is a fix for this problem.
