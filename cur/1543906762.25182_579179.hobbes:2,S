I have an issue that sounds like it's related.
I've got a syslog server that's got two Opteron 246 cpu's, 16G ram, 2x140G 
15k rpm drives (fusion MPT hardware mirroring), 16x500G 7200rpm SATA 
drives on 3ware 9500 cards (software raid6) running 2.6.20.3 with hz set 
at default and preempt turned off.
I have syslog doing buffered writes to the SCSI drives and every 5 min a 
cron job copies the data to the raid array.
I've found that if I do anything significant on the large raid array that 
the system looses a significant amount of the UDP syslog traffic, even 
though there should be pleanty of ram and cpu (and the spindles involved 
in the writes are not being touched), even a grep can cause up to 40% 
losses in the syslog traffic. I've experimented with nice levels (nicing 
down the grep and nicing up the syslogd) without a noticable effect on the 
losses.
I've been planning to try a new kernel with hz=1000 to see if that would 
help, and after that experiment with the various preempt settings, but it 
sounds like the per-device queues may actually be more relavent to the 
problem.
what would you suggest I test, and in what order and combination?
