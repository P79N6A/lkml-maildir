Of the device size; it doubles the guessed size of the disk until
lseek+read returns an error, and then uses binary search to figure out
the size of the disk.  I did this because it works on pretty much any
OS.

Yes, it works irrespective of what's on the disk.  In fact, if the
Linux-specific ioctl's are not available, it's what will be used by
mke2fs to figure out the size of the device.
