Well I've just tried 2.6.11-mm1 with that patch reverted and it still
leaks so I must be mistaken I'm afraid.  I'll go and trawl through the
builds I've done and try a simpler config as I reverted back to a

Sorry - I had gone through carefully and that was the one that made
the difference.  Back to some more builds :-(
