Hello,
I also updated memory hotplug patches for hugetlbpages.
The patches are against linux 2.6.5 and work with 
memory hotplug patches which Iwamoto just posted.
Main changes from previous version are:
	* Now remap code is shared between hugetlbpage handling
	  and normal page handling. New remap_operations table is
	  introduced for this purpose and it can handle any kind
	  of pages which have diffirent feature from normal one.
	  This made the remap code simple.
	* Made pagefault routine for hugetlbpage stable.
	  Two or more threads can happen to make pagefault
	  at the same hugetlbpage, at the same time.
/proc/memhotplug interface also provide infomation about Hugetlbpages.
  ex.)
   $ cat /proc/memhotplug 
   Node 0 enabled nonhotremovable
           DMA[0]: free 964, active 34, present 4096 / HugePage free 0, total 0
           Normal[1]: free 9641, active 36633, present 126976 / HugePage free 0, total 0
   Node 1 enabled hotremovable
           Normal[5]: free 208, active 86115, present 94208 / HugePage free 0, total 0
           HighMem[6]: free 0, active 17234, present 34816 / HugePage free 8, total 16
   Node 2 enabled hotremovable
           HighMem[10]: free 272, active 109643, present 128000 / HugePage free 0, total 0
