It might be interesting to look at this timeline:
http://www.levenez.com/unix/
Which shows when the first linux kernel was released, and a lot more
info (like how in the older days, there were 2 types of linux,
"stable" and "unstable")
It also shows the different influences the various unices had on each
other (like how Linux was inspired by / losely based on Minix)
