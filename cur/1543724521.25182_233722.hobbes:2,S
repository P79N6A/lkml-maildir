Maybe I'm just missing the whole point but I wonder if we could define
a series of 'test' a version should pass before being marked as -rc ir
final.
Now that we have the automated BK snapshots the "public" release seems
to be a minor milestone in the process.
I would like to see ltp test suite, OSDL's compile stats and OSDL
benchmarking as part of the release process.
Does it make sense ?
