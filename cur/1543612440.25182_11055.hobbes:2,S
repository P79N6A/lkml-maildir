Subject: network interface names ethX and renaming interfaces

Hello *,
in Linux 2.2.20 I have a problem renaming the network interface dummy0
to eth0 and then starting a regular ethernet driver --- I would like
it to come up as eth1 but it comes up as eth0, messing up the dummy0
interface.
Reading the source, it appears that in init_ethernev(), ethernet
drivers claim device names according to the array ethdev_index and
shoot down any device name eth0 claimed by a non-ethernet driver.
Therefore it appears to me that SIOCSIFNAME should either disallow
renaming to ethX or it should adjust ethdev_index.
Thanks in advance for any comment/advice,
Hein
