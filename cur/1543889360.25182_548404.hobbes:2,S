Hmmm... Bad. We have conflicting reports and no clear way to trigger the 
bug. This may actually only trigger depending on how certain objects is 
place in memory.
Could you boot with slub_debug and then run
slabinfo -v
to validate all slabs? If there is anything wrong with an object then it 
should show in the syslog.
slabinfo.c can be found at Documentation/vm/slabinfo.c

See Documentation/vm/slub.txt which covers most of those.
slub_nomerge is not mentioned. It removes an optimization and that is only 
useful for debugging strange cornercases. I hope to remove it someday.
