Not sure about that... the Makefile you supplied was looking like a 2.4 
one (and looks correct from what I understand from the Docs). I must say 
that I used kbuild-2.5 port to 2.4 to build the module (kbuild-2.5 makes 
the build of a single module really easy), so I did not test the 
original Makefile (kernel-Makefile guru around while it builds ?).

Damn, you're right. Why the h&*( the compiler did not yell about this one ??
