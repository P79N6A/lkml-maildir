Ouch. I don't see anything obviously related in the patch... I would
probably start with putting echo foo > /dev/console into the
/etc/.../network and searching for the binary that hangs. Then -
strace the thing. Yes, it _is_ painful.
Another thing that makes me wonder WTF had happened in -pre1 is a bunch of
reports on man problems. User-cache, maybe?
