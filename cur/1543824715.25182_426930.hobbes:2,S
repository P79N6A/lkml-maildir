Memory that the kernel never sets up for DMA ever.

But the problem is fundamentally hard.  I do not want to encourage
people to make changes without thinking through all of the consequences.
So far my impression is that an additional per-architecture data area
is struct kimage encourages people to be sloppy, and it moves key structures
farther from where they are used.  I am coming to suspect it is as bad
as ioctl.
I could probably be convinced with a good use of a per-architecture
area and a well reasoned argument.  But at the moment changing the
infrastructure is unnecessary noise, so please drop that for now.

Dependent patches are not a problem.

Simplicity is good.  
Doing unnecessary things is confusing and the issue is not good,
and at least until the Xen support is merged you were doing
unnecessary things.
Please just take it carefully.  This is possibly the hardest
to debug code path in the kernel and currently it works.  I
don't want to break that.
