Subject: i810 sound broken...

I've noticed some writing on lkml on how i810(AC97) sound was broken. Aparantly a couple of fixes have been posted, but I couldn't see where(if at all) those patches have gone... 2.4.19 still does not work and 2.4.19-ac3 won't even load the i810 module.
Does anybody know if the known i810 sound issue has, in fact, been fixed, and if so - in what kernel/patch?
rgds, Thomas
