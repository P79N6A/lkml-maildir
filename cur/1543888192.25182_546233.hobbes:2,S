I asked this earlier, but figured you might have a better insight.   
Is their value in having 'drivers' for more than one clock source?   
I'd say most (of not all) the PPC SoCs have timers on the system side  
that we could provide drivers for, I'm just not sure if that does  
anything for anyone.
