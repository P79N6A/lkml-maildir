Greetings,
I am developing a system using the Intel SE7520BD2 motherboard. It has an
ICH5 with two SATA ports and one PATA channel. I am able to drive the PATA
channel with either the normal PIIX IDE driver or the libata driver which I
am using for the SATA ports. Ultimately all 4 ports will be in use with the
md driver creating a stripe volume (RAID0) that spans a partition on each of
the 4 drives (not for boot).
My question is, what is the recommended driver to use for the PATA channel?
Is it better to let libata support both types of drives, or use the IDE
driver for the PATA? Searching I have found that the support is there in
libata for the PATA channel (and I have it working on the system), but I
can't find a clear recommendation on which driver is considered 'better' in
this situation.
Thanks!
