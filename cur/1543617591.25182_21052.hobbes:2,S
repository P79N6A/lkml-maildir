I just checked 2.5.3-pre1 and it still makes references to
registers above 0x0f.   I see many references to registers
at  0x11, 0x1b, 0x1f.  For example, the following:
unsigned long atapi_reg	= high_16 + (hwif->channel ? 0x24 : 0x00);
That assumes atapi_reg will be 0x24 beyond the base of bar4 (high_16).
Is my PCI code showing me an incorrect size for bar4, or is this
accessing registers beyond its limits?
Thanks.
