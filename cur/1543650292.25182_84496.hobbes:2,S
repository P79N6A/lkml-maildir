Thank you. Shame on me, this solution shows up with
google.fr/search?q=CONFIG_RTL8139 ... (though, can you add in the
linux-2.2.22/Documentation/Configure.help file that CONFIG_RTL8139 is an
experimental driver ? Alternatively, does it exist a file containing this
type of datas (e.g., for CONFIG_RTL8139 : Code maturity level options ->
Prompt for development + Network device support -> Ethernet (10 or
100Mbit) -> RealTek 8129/8139).
Thank you for both your helps !
[end of story: Yesterday, I have compiled tht rtl8139 driver by hacking
the Makefiles, and I didn't try make xconfig of make config]
