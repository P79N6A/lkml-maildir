Sorry, you're wrong. No physical memory (RAM or swap) is actually given to
a process until after the program touches the page; malloc() alone is not
sufficient. Proof is below.

No, it does not. The malloc() call returns a pointer to a region of
address space that will be filled by the kernel if and when those pages
are faulted. No physical pages (RAM or swap) are allocated by a call to
malloc(), no mater how /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory is set.

Sorry, you're wrong on this one. Even with /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
set to 0, you can easily have a task malloc() a region larger than the
available virtual memory.
Example:
[root@sleepy dwhysong]# echo "0" > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory 
[dwhysong@sleepy dwhysong]$ cat mem.c
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        char *a;
        unsigned n;
        n = atoi(argv[1]);
        a = (char *) malloc(1024*1024*n);
        printf("Allocating %u megabytes at %p\n",n,a);
        return(0);
}
[dwhysong@sleepy dwhysong]$ gcc mem.c -o mem
[dwhysong@sleepy dwhysong]$ free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        257788      98764     159024      19400      37708      32264
-/+ buffers/cache:      28792     228996
Swap:       642016       2200     639816
[dwhysong@sleepy dwhysong]$ ./mem 800
Allocating 800 megabytes at 0x40108008
[dwhysong@sleepy dwhysong]$ ./mem 1000
Allocating 1000 megabytes at (nil)
So malloc() returns success when I ask for an 800 megabyte array on a
machine with only ~640 megabytes of free virtual memory.
