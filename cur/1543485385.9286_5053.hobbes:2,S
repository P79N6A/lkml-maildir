WTF is this?
Anyone else get this message?  It was posted to linux-hppa@vger
to which I am not subscribed.  I'm assuming they sent it to
several vger lists, and possibly l-k too.
It would be nice if we could meet these assholes in real life,
right in person.  Come knock on my door or something.  I'd break
a fucking car jack over their fucking heads.  All I have to say
to them is FUCK OFF AND DIE.
