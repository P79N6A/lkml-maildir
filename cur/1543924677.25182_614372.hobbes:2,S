Subject: [PATCH 6/6] UML - Borrow const.h techniques
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/5/272

Suggested by Geert Uytterhoeven - use const.h to get constants that
are usable in both C and assembly.  I can't include it directly since
this code can't include kernel headers.  const.h is also for numeric
constants that can be typed by tacking a "UL" or similar on the end.
The constants here have to be typed by casting them.
So, the relevant parts of const.h are copied here and modified in
order to allow the constants to be uncasted in assembly and casted in
C.
