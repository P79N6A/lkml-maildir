This discussion went broke-minded again. Your still picturing that single
IDE hard drive in your workstation and im talking about big iron, large
databases, etc.. where the total amount of aggregate disk I/O is completely
limited by the rate you can evict pages from the pagecache.
Picture 6 to 7 fibre channel cards with over 70% utilization during peak
usage times connected to a large EMC storage array with 64GB of non-volatile
cache.
