UDP is not a very good choice of protocol for this purpose. UDP pushes the
transmit timing job into user-space, where it cannot be done particularly
well.

Why do you want to avoid bursts? You're going to be bursting between 10Gb/s
and 0 anyway.
It sounds like you're deliberately putting impossible requirements on
yourself choosing the worst possible protocol and demanding the pacing be
perfect. I don't think the technology to do that is here yet, but why would
you possibly need it?
10GE cards tend to have large buffers precisely because it's not possible to
get the timing even. Why is burstiness a problem?
