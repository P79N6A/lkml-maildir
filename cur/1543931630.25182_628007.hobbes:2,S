The BUG()/WARN_ON() parts of my patch are becoming something of a rathole,
which I don't really have time to dig into right now, so I'm going to split
this up I think into mm/ additions, spinlockdebug additions, and bugon/warnon foo.
The three should be independant, and blocking the first two until I get
time to look at the third seems pointless.
