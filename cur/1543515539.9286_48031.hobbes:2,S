Exactly.  That is why I brought it up.  The licencing "seems" to
be GPL, but it is worded badly.  I just wanted to see it reworded
properly for both our benefit, and the benefit of Hans and anyone
else who works on it as well.

Right, the statements seem to echo what is in the GNU GPL
allready, but are worded badly and non-legal-sounding.  Who knows
how it would be interpreted if it ever needed to be.
His intentions seem to be:  The program is licenced under the GNU
General Public Licence version 2 or later, but is also available
under private licence for any interested parties.

Right.  That seems to be the gist of it.  Any "licence" or other
legal document should not allow or force the reader to make
assumptions though, as others may see it differently.
Clarification is always best IMHO.

Right, sounds good.

Right.  I agree with your interpretation as well.  The fact that
the "addendum" is meaningless as worded is what I'd like to see
corrected.  I don't want to see someone sideswipe the licence due
to bad wording and perhaps steal the code.
It is important that we correct or point out licencing errors
like this when we find them, so that they can be fixed, and can
protect software the way the author truely intended - but perhaps
wasn't able to word well.
Take care!
