Subject: [PATCH] mmap zero-length hugetlb file with PROT_NONE to protect a hugetlb virtual area
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

From: Zhang, Yanmin <yanmin.zhang@intel.com>
Sometimes, applications need below call to be successful although
"/mnt/hugepages/file1" doesn't exist.
fd = open("/mnt/hugepages/file1", O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0755);
*addr = mmap(NULL, 0x1024*1024*256, PROT_NONE, 0, fd, 0);
As for regular pages (or files), above call does work, but as for huge pages,
above call would fail because hugetlbfs_file_mmap would fail if 
(!(vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE) && len > inode->i_size). 
 
This capability on huge page is useful on ia64 when the process wants to 
protect one area on region 4, so other threads couldn't read/write this
area. A famous JVM (Java Virtual Machine) implementation on IA64 needs the
capability.
The patch against 2.6.17-mm6 provides the capability.
