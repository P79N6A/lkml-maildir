Tons of kernel code does
	spin_lock_irqsave(...)
	Sit around
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(...)
On the 68K you really do want that to be spin_lock_irqsave_except_rtbits()
and you really do need that. It isnt even down to poor driver writing, the
timing constraints on an 8530 on an old 68K box are horrible.
Right now a mac68k is pushing it to do 19200 baud in Linux but with rt hacks
will do 115,200 and with irq path tidying should do 230,400
