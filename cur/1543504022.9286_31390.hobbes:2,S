A DSP is very much a number crunching machine. Most are more specifically
polynomial crunching machines. They lack almost everything a general purpose
OS like Linux needs - a general purpose instruction set, MMU, large memory
support, etc.
Take an application like a modem. The DSP can do all the heavy calculations
for the signal processing part well. Now you need a little management and V42
error correction and data compression. Try doing that part on a DSP and the
code gets large, slow and _very_ ugly.
Real time OSes do exist for some DSPs (e.g. SPOX), but they are _very_ much
specialist DSP OSes, and they ain't too pretty.
