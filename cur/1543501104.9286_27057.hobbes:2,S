Starting with Kernel 2.3.6 and above the menus using xconfig do not work
correctly.  Also starting with 2.3.6 MSDOS VFAT and NTFS no  longer
compile.  The compile stops in file.c starting with line #60.  htere are
absolutly no problems using 2.3.5 everything compiles and works.  I can
let you or anyone telnet into my system to see what is happening.  I am
on a very high speed modem ( cable ),  I am somewhat new to this
environment so if you wish for me to help debug I will need lots of
instructions.  Linux is great and I hope to be able to contribute to the
cause.  My
Steven
