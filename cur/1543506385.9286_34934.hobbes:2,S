Well, I hope to see nothing change, but if it is deemed to be
necessary by davem, et al.  then I guess we'll have to bear with
the changes.
I'm interested to see what Linus thinks about it personally.  I
would be inclined to believe he would like to leave it the same,
and make a personal visit to our "friend"'s house late in the
evening - after consuming 10 entire packages of penguin mints,
and losing the latest version of the kernel after 10 days work,
and fsck saying that his disk is toast.
