I had a similar problem with the NUMA policies. With some minor hacks
you could probably reuse the policy support by making it a weird kind
of policy.  That would allow to keep the fast path impact very low,
which I think is the most important part of such hardware specific
narrow purpose, useless to 99.9999% of all users hacks 
(Golden rule number 1 such code: dont impact anything else)
