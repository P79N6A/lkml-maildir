Be aware of the following: If a recent NTP daemon detects an old NTP kernel 
interface (like that of unpatched Linux), it will not use the NTP kernel interface 
at all ("disable kernel"). Thus no leap second processing will happen (AFAIK).

Fight the real problem then: Update the kernel NTP interface to the current one 
(which is several years old by now). It's named "nanokernel" by Dave Mills, and it 
was exactly the reason why I had patched Linux 2.4 to provide a nanosecond clock 
resolution (in theory), and I also thought that's the reason for having 
nanoseconds with your patch set ;-)
