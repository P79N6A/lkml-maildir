- to make the quota active (enable it), the mount option
  is required
- to display an enabled quota as mount option, the quota
  on that 'mount point' has to be enabled 
chicken egg thing, eh?
besides that, not every mountpoint can support quota
and quota should (must) not be enabled at mount time
because before the quota is enabled, the quota hash
has to be initialized to the current usage ...

yep, after 'enabling' quota on a specific filesystem
the kernel knows which quota is enabled ...

yes, and basically the 'mount options' are not stored
by the kernel in any way, so it would be simple to 
remove that check in the quota tools and replace them
by something else ...

yes, quota calculation, see above ...
