you misunderstand my question.
the claim was that UUID's are unique and don't have to be assigned by the 
admins.
I'm saying that in my experiance there isn't any standard or reliable way 
to generate such a UUID and I'm asking for the people makeing the 
claim to educate me on what I'm missing becouse a reliable UUID for linux 
on all hardware would be extremely useful for many things.
