	Yes, the difference is between 2.6.9-rc1 (works) and -rc2 (does not
work). Removing the snd-atiixp module after resume and inserting it
back again helps, but this means killing every app which uses audio
interface (so you cannot keep mplayer running over suspend/resume cycle,
and gnome-settings-daemon keeps /dev/mixer opened all the time too).
	I have tried to add printk() to
linux/sound/pci/atiixp.c:snd_atiixp_suspend() and _resume(), but I cannot
see it in dmesg(8) output after resume. Maybe those functions are not
called at all in 2.6.9-rc2 and newer.
