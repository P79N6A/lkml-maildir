Hello All,
Currently I've got myself a nice setup (amd 1.4ghz, abit kg7raid etc etc) 
with 512mb ram... (DDR). I'm wondering if increasing this to 1gb has 
advantages (speedwise or anything), since I can get my hands on it at a very 
low price...
I must say that even with most of my applications loaded/running, the system 
never even touches the swap partition.
So, would it be wise?
Thanks for any info
DevilKin
