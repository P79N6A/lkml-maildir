I do not know of any manufacturers still making machines or cards based on
MicroChannel.  However, there is a very sizable user base of older
machines that use it.
Production of MCA RS/6ks was killed in 1996/7 (iirc), I'm betting those
were the last to use MCA.  Though there might have been a few MCA PS/2's
produced around then as well.
