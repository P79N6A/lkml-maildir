Alan, is it me or usermode port really tends to catch the stack overflows?
<thinks> How about we allocate the pages by 4, not by 2 as we do now, and
explicitly unmap the pages below the task_struct? That would still leave the
chance of stack overflow going unnoticed, but the window would be limited.
Another possibility for ptrace-related screwups: past-the-EOF check in
filemap_nopage(). I'm still not convinced that it's right. It may be, but...
