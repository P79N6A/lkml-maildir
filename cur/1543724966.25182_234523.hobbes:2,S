I've run the test and it looks like VM in 2.6 does not suffer from
excessive swapping, at least for this test. It could be you need to get
more memory load to get such effect (I was only using some 2G out of 4G
for application, the rest was file cache).
Anyway this is pretty good news.

My concern is mainly users which normally run kernel with default
settings. Things should work for them as well. 
To be honest I do not really understand this OOM without swap problem at
all, why is it possible to move pages from ZONE_NORMAL to swap but not
to other zones ?
