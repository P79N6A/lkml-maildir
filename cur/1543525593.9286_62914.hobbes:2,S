Hi,
I've updated the 2.2 series patch to pre-2.2.15-7.
Changes:
- Fix sense reporting + handling.
- A few extra sense code, one redundant.
- Fix IDE expiry clearing handler too soon.
- Fix possible bug in sense analyzing
- Remove ide-cd write status flag
- Return sense to user space for cgc command regardless of command
  result (user app can extract progress information by issuing
  test unit commands and examining sense data).
- Remove redundant locking (and make sure to relock after a reset).
- Some drives failed READ_DISC_INFO, get length and issue command
  twice. Similar to READ_TRACK_INFO work-around.
- Pack fixed_packet_size, it is not properly aligned in struct.
- Support CDROM_SEND_PACKET on sparc64.
Some of this should go into 2.2.X, as some of the bugs exists in
the stock kernel as well, but let's wait for 2.2.16-pre first.
