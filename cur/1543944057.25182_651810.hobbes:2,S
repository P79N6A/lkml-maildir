Well, I've already bisected that down to commit
6f505b16425a51270058e4a93441fe64de3dd435 "sched: rt group scheduling" and
provided a simple test case.  Moreover, there are patches from Peter that fix
the problem, but they are lost somewhere in the way from him to you (please see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/5/535
 and 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/6/320
).
Thanks,
