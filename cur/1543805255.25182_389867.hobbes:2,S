So looking at the code hard_smp_processor_id is fine.  Voyager
also implements that.
If we are running UP with an SMP kernel we are fine.
But I think x86_cpu_to_apicid will get us into trouble
on Voyager, because I don't think we should compile smpboot.c
as it has conflicting simples with voyager_smp.c
Although reading the makefile I don't see how we can avoid
compiling them both in SMP mode.
Everything else has a local apic when running SMP so we should
be good there.
