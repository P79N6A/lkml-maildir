sys_pselect6() is just a hackish workaround for the fact that most
architectures don't allow seven-argument syscalls. Having your own
workaround in assembly, which then calls sys_pselect6(), seems a little
odd -- why not call sys_pselect7() directly instead from your assembly
wrapper?
Stop a moment and work out precisely what the best way to pass the
arguments _is_ if you have only 5 registers and the stack, perhaps.

¹ Note that I'm just _asking_ -- the answer "Uli doesn't want to support
anything but the basic 6-argument sys_pselect6() in glibc" is an
acceptable answer on your part.
