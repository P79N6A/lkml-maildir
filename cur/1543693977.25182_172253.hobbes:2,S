Well there are two reasons for discouraging cleanups.  The first is of
course that they can destabilise things.  But the other is that we want as
many developers as possible (Hi, Jesse) concentrating on stabilisation.
I hereby introduce the "bugzilla tax".  The cost of each cleanup is two
fixes for open bugzilla entries.
But if David really wants this change, and ongoing stabilisation work will
be based on top of it then yes, it probably should go in after good
testing.
