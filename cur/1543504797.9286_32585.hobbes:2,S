even two seconds can be statistical noise (eg. look at the user-time
numbers, those increased by one second.). But it's not so hard to test
high-intensity VM with kernel compiles. This method is from Davem: compile
the kernel with 'make -jN', where N = 1,2,3... increasingly. [also put
'make -jN' into the top Makefile.] Sometimes at N=6 or so you'll fall out
of core 128M RAM. This is both a good stability and a good performance
test. You can even automate it. This way you'll see both the effect on
'normal' (cached) and 'high load' (swapping) situations. Such a list of
numbers is a much more reliable measurement of performance than just one
arbitrary number.
