Let me defend myself.
The qla2xxx driver numbers devices differently than qlogicfc does.
The qla2xxx driver never existed upstream until it was added a few
months ago, and even with that it's 2.6.x only, therefore people
using pure upstream kernels for all of their systems (such as myself)
has only the qlogicfc driver to use.
So it's not how loud I can yell or not, it's that not keeping the
qlogicfc driver around would break people's systems.
You could remove the qlogicfc driver if you really wanted, by providing
a config option that would provide qlogicfc compatible device numbering
in the qla2xxx driver.
So implement that instead of bitching about me trying to keep people's
systems functional, ok? :-)
