Nobody else posted specific requirements so far. So let's clean up the 
API. How about this:
  - Determine a date or event at which unused symbols and functions will
    vanish. ("Unused": Not used by the mainline drivers and video-2-1394
    or any other project of similar scope of which the linux1394
    maintainers are informed soon enough.)
  - Add an according entry to Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt.
  - Add warning comments next to obsolete EXPORT_SYMBOLs. Add warning
    printks to obsolete functions? (If there are any.)
Are there proposals for a date? How about end of June?
