Hello,
Today I discovered this in my syslogs, after something strange 
happening to XFree86 (hung at startup, then dumped me back to the console)
is_leaf: free space seems wrong: level=1, nr_items=41, free_space=65224 rdkey 
vs-5150: search_by_key: invalid format found in block 283191. Fsck?
vs-13070: reiserfs_read_locked_inode: i/o failure occurred trying to find stat data of [11 12795 0x0 SD]

I've never seen these before, and I've been digging through my syslogs but am 
unable to find any other references of this.
Does this mean the disk is dying? Or just the filesystem is corrupt? 
Unfortunately, I'm not able to rebuild the tree at this time because I 
haven't got a 'rescue' disk with me and the errors are on my root partition...
Any other pointers?
Thanks.
Jan
