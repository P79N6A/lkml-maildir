The x360 doesnt require James' current patches (that arent in the mainstream
quite yet), but what it DOES require that you wont have in the 2.2 stream 
is ACPI parsing. 
The Linus kernel has support to boot fully HT on these boxes as of 2.4.17.
There are a number of changes related to the processor in it. In order to
detect HT you will need the acpitable code. In order to have the machine
function well beyond that you will want changes that Ingo put into the
scheduler :).
Personally I cant tell how much work you will have porting drivers to 2.4
but it might be easier than getting all the support you need back into
the 2.2 kernel, and even if you do backport it I dont know that you'd 
get it in officially :)
