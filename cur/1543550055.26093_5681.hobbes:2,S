Unfortunately, it is not. ipx is maintained by Jay Schulist, 
jschlst@turbolinux.com. I tried to do some changes in ipx year ago
(removing kernel lock), but after I saw ipx interface autocreation
from incoming packet notification routine, I gave up (not that it
works now, when it is guarded by big kernel lock ;-) )

ecx contains sk->protinfo.af_ipx.intrfc. It is pointer. It contains 1...
I have no idea how it can happen, except... did not you change kernel configuration
between compilation of kernel and modules? I can't think any reason except that
you changed one of CONFIG_IPV6, CONFIG_INET, CONFIG_SPX or CONFIG_FILTER
during compile.
Sorry, but I do not have better news for you...
