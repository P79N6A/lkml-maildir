This would also be very nice for CPUs that can set the clock speed on
demand. The SA-1100 can do that trick: the clock can be scaled from
60 to 220 MHz in ~15 MHz steps. Although a slow clock preserves
batteries, but we did not yet implement clock scaling on the LART[1]
because of the timing loop implications (and lack of time is also a
reason ;-). What are the implications of recomputing the bogomips?
Or is it easier to just recompute it if you know your current CPU
clock speed?
