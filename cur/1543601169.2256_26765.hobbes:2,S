Didn't discover yet, the only "strange" thing is when using <TAB>
autocompleteion in a kterm in kde i get every time a kde crash-bug-report
popup message. however, no kernel messages or whatsoever.

Well it's a fpu patch, and as far as i know i don't use the fpu that much
at the moment but i'll try that.
in the hope finding the usage of fpu-irq:
sjoerd:/usr/src/linux # cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
  0:   13374740          XT-PIC  timer
  1:      14581          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  9:     238018          XT-PIC  usb-uhci, usb-uhci, EMU10K1
 10:     601500          XT-PIC  ide2, sym53c8xx
 11:      87300          XT-PIC  eth0
 12:     230338          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse
 14:     331764          XT-PIC  ide0
 15:      39468          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0
ERR:          0
But /proc/interrupts shows only those irq's which are currently in use, is
there any way to show usage of currenlty unused interrupts?
