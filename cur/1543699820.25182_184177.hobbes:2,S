Hi,
Actually, it will be first a user-space driver.
Maybe I wasn't clear:
I link the PCI library with '-lpci' option, but it seems the library is 
not complete, ie I can't use the whole lib. For example, the compiler 
cannot link pci_resource_start() func. or pci_fond_device(). I think 
these are usually in all pci libraries... My lib does not support dma 
abilities too.
My problem is that I have several pci.h files which contain these 
function (the 'whole package?'), but I don't have the lib that fits 
to...
For example
 >>grep pci_resource_start /usr/lib/pcilib.a
returns nothing. I think it should.
I was just wondering how I will be able to retrieve the good lib, which 
I can't find on my PC.  Tried to update the Red Hat (and kernel), but 
it didn't change anything in my lib. I guess someone installed sthg on 
my PC, which removed the 'good' pci library, or changed it for an other 
lighter version.
Is there anything related with CONFIG_... flags??
Damien
