I imagine so.  But that still leaves everything in RAM.  On a
system with just 1 or 2 MB of ram (I have run Linux on such
things :-) there really isn't much point in trying to use any
sortof ramfs.  Its just not going to work.  For that type of
application you really want something like JFFS, JFFS2 and
whatnot living in ROM/flash.  But I'm sure someone could find 
a reason for a *ramfs to be useful, even then.... :)
