Alright, I can do that.  What about cisco_ipsec and fglrx?  cisco_ipsec I 
could live without, but fglrx would be difficult.  I've never been able to 
get the radeon driver working on my system, at all.
Sorry if that sounds silly and the VMware drivers are the only ones that could 
be possibly causing the problem.
Thanks for the response.
