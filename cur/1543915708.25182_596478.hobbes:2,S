Dave, 
     I agree that setting SOCK_NOSPACE would have been a more elegant
fix. Infact I thought a lot about that before deciding on this fix.
    But the point here is that the SOCK_NOSPACE bit can be set when 
the sndbuf space is really less (less than sk_stream_min_wspace())
and some user action (sendmsg or poll) indicated his intent to write.
    In the case mentioned none of these is true. Since user wants
to manage his tranmit buffers himself, his definition of less may
not match with what kernel feels is less. f.e. user might have 
dynamically changing mmap'ed buffer resources at his disposal 
which he wants to use as sendfile buffers. He wants to be notified
whenever a new incoming ack frees up one or more of his buffers,
so that he can reuse that buffer.
    The bigger problem is that user is not indicating his intent
to write, to the kernel. He is just watching the sendbuf space and
when it matches his needs he will send new data. 
Thanx,
Tomar
