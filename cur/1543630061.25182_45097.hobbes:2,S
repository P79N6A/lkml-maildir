For 2.4, I suspect I need to keep this in the ia64 patch anyhow
because it is also necessary to fix scsi_dma.c so it can deal with
allocation bitmaps that are bigger than 32 bits.
I believe ia64 is currently the only platform that supports 64KB
pages.  If so, there is probably not much point trying to get this
past Marcelo (and the patch is large enough to have the potential for
introducing new bugs).  If another platform cares about this, please
speak up.

I'll keep an eye on it.  It's working fine so far, but that doesn't
replace a code audit.  If you happen to bump into something during
your normal work, please let me know.
Thanks,
