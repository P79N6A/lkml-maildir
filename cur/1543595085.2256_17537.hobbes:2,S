Hmm. This *is* the company that has at least one guy full-time working on  
merging their changes back into gcc (with the right Copyright  
assignments), and where the guy in question does discuss how to make gcc  
work nice with both Apple's application framework and the GPL clone of it.
Oh, and one intern working right now to improve gcc's errors-and-warnings  
code, because that's what the gcc list came up with as a task.
Sure, that's not many people in such a large company, but it's a vast  
difference from MS, and it's also a vast difference from the earlier Apple  
from the look-and-feel lawsuit age.
For a while, they also paid someone for working on Debian's packaging tool  
(dpkg) which they now use for Darwin; at the time, that guy was  
practically the dpkg lead developer.
And don't forget MkLinux.
Apple is not another Red Hat, but they're not a Black Hat either.
