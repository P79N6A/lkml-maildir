The benefits of a 'paper' logo are as follows:
1. It builds 'brand' awareness
2. It means that when you take a piece of hardware of the shelf in  
the store you don't need to check an online database for compatibility.

I presume that drivers will be developed alongside the hardware  
because you can't sell the kit until the drivers are on the CD in the  
nice box with the instruction manual.
Also you can't test the hardware properly unless you have drivers for  
it.
