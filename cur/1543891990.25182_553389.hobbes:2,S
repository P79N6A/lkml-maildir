Sorry, I will not.  My local policy (which I have the utmost right to
have) is that I do not wish to be CC'd on responses to replies to my
posts.  Additional useless CC's are a waste of my limited bandwidth
and resources.
It's a question of local policy required by local resource limitations.
So I give you a choice: you can either have the benefit of me reply and
put up with the follow up header, or I will arrange to never reply to
your messages ever again (which may involve me never reading one again).
Which would you prefer?

mail servers.
