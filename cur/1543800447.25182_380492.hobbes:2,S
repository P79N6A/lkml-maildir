Hiya all,
First of all happy new year ! :-)
I might have discovered something interesting which might be responsible
for all those lockups/freezes/crashes !
Right now, i'm putting a huge load on the system, disk i/o, swapping
high, virusscan, number crushing with ssh-keygen moduli etc ...
5 hours passed with this load and no single crash/freeze/lockup happened
! Normally with all this load sooner or later something would have
happened.
What did i do ?
I disabled bttv support in the kernel, so no tv for me at this moment.
I'm planning to let this run for at least another 5 hours with heavy
load and see if still nothing happens...
Keeping you informed.
Mark
