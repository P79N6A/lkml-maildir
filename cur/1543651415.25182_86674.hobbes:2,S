I removed parts of 2.5.43-bk1 and that solved my problem, see attached mail
below. When I did this (2 weeks ago) I removed all changes that touched
net/* and associated includes. I was not able to pinpoint the exact change
that causes the problem, the changes there are a bit to much for my knowledge 
of the kernel, sorry.

Hi,
i posted the message below to linux-mm yesterday, Andrew Morton told me that
it might be one of the changes in networking in -bk1.
removing these changes solved the problem:

 include/linux/tcp.h       |    2=20
 include/linux/udp.h       |   31 -

 net/netsyms.c             |    1=20
(this is the diffstat of the reverse patch)
Is this fixed already?

Hi,=20
funny problem w. 2.5.43-mm2:
i'm running 2.5.43-mm2 on my workstation. Normal workload, X-windows, a few
xterms, editor, mozilla, etc. (host A)
I have a NFS/SAMBA-mount (both show the problem) to host B. Host B runs
2.4.19rc5aa1.
I can get a xterm, in which i have a ssh-connection to a third host C
'stuck' by simply cat'ing a large file from the NFS/SAMBA server to
/dev/null.
The xterm/ssh seems stuck, that is no key i press is received on the other
end, but output of the program running on host C is updated in the xterm. I
checked with tcpdump: the keypress does not generate a packet, my host only
sends ACK's on that ssh connection to host C.
The ssh-connection is not unstuck by stopping the data transfer from host B.
I checked that plain 2.5.42 and 2.5.43-mm1 do not have this problem: here my
input goes through to C. At least for small amounts of input, i did not test
anything beyond typing a few hundret chars.
recap:
 "mount /mnt/hostB"
 "ssh hostC" -> type random stuff in that connection
 at the same time do "cat /mnt/hostB/bigfile > /dev/null"
 ssh gets stuck.
hardware: PIII/600, 3c905B on 10baseT half-duplex
I'm sorry i cant do any further checks until Friday afternoon (MET).
/B.
