Subject: [PATCH 19/22] elevate writer count for custom struct_file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/2/9/364

Some filesystems forego the use of normal vfs calls to create
struct files.  Make sure that these users elevate the mnt writer
count.  These probably don't have any real meaning because there
is no real backing store for these mounts, but it is here for
consistency.
