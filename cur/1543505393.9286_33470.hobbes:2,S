Just a quick question:
I know that there are people working on generic USB support and several
specific devices.  Is anyone looking at/thinking of adding a USB driver
for the Logitech USB QuickCam's?  There are already parallel port
drivers, and although Logitech stonewalled me when I asked for the API
(or any help at all with writing/porting a linux driver) one might at
least hope that the API is similar although the device is different.
If not, any hints from guru's on how I might proceed on my own would be
appreciated.
