Hi Richard.
 > I read ide.txt and then used the following in lilo.conf (on one line):
 > append="mca-pentium,ibmmcascsi=display,0x3540,7,
 >         hda=none,hdb=none,hdc=none,hdd=none,ide0=noprobe,ide1=noprobe"
I don't know whether it's relevant, but when I've needed to put
multiple entries in the append line, I've always separated them with
spaces, not commas...
YMMV
Best wishes from Riley.
