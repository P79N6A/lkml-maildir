mem read/write latency for memory mapped uncachable doesn't always have a
direct relationship to the cold-cache case of the normal cachable path.
it's still an interesting thing to measure the uncachable path -- but
if you're really interested in the cachable path you need to do it a
different way.
the absolute best way to look at cold cache mem read latency is to set up
a random pointer chase.  it has to be random because you want to eliminate
the effect of automatic hw prefetchers present in most modern hardware.
lmbench 3.0 has some code which is almost right (iirc it's the lat_mem
component) -- but it does these random walks within a page before moving
to another page.  this doesn't defeat prefetchers well enough.  i.e. a
prefetcher need only see a couple accesses on a page before it can just
decide to stream the entire page in and get a better cache hit rate.
in my experience there are prefetchers which defeat this.
in case you haven't heard of a pointer chase, it's basically a loop which
looks like this:
	void *p = foo;
	for (;;) {
		p = *(void **)p;
		p = *(void **)p;
		p = *(void **)p;
		... repeated 100 times
	}
it's a linked list walk basically.
the genius of pointer chases is that you can measure a bazillion memory
system details just by varying the layout of the linked list.
to defeat L1/L2/prefetchers choose a large arena, say 32MiB, break it up
into 64B (or whatever the linesize is) objects, then place those objects
into a linked list in a random order.

p.s. bunzip2 is a real-world workload which is essentially a random
memory walk over 4-byte objects in a 3600000 byte array.
