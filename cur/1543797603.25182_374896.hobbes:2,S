Yes I agree, however note that some of the asumptions are backed up and
required by RFCs. For example the binding of addresses to interfaces. This
is especially strongly required in the IPV6 world with all the scoping and
renumbering RFCs.
The things you want to change need to be changed in kernel space, btw.
