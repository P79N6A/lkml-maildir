I be one of them. :)  I have been involved in many (but not all)
of IBM's x86 based (IBM System x) servers with hotplug capable
PCI slots.  I have mostly worked on 'acpiphp' associated issues.

I am not fundamentally opposed to this new capability but
share the same concerns that Greg and others have expressed.
So far, I have only tried the changes on one single node
system (IBM x3850) but the below NAK-worthy result supports
the idea that the changes need to be well and widely tested.
Have you possibly considered a kernel option as a kinder and
gentler way of introducing the changes?
