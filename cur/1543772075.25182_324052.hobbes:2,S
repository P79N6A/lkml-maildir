Right. I agree that large allocs should be reliable. Whether we care so
much about if they're performant or not, I don't know ... is an interesting
question. I think the answer is maybe not, within reason. The cost of
fishing in the allocator might well be irrelevant compared to the cost
of freeing the necessary memory area?

Mmmm. that doesn't look too bad at all to me.

Sounds great ... would be really valuable to get those testcases.
