I was not clear - I meant why do we need to do that when we can run the
same code in userspace? And better if we can have non-blocking dataflows
and number of threads equal to number of processors...

I started a week of writing without russian-english dictionary, so
expect some troubles in communications with me :)
I said that about kernel design - when we have thousand(s) of threads,
which do the work - if number of context switches is small (i.e. when
operations mostly do not block), then it is ok (although 'ps' output 
with threads can scary a grandma).
It is also ok to say - 'hey, Linux has so easy AIO model, so that
everyone should switch and start using it and do not care about problems 
associated with multi-threaded programming with high concurrency', 
but, in my opinion, both that cases can not cover all (and most of) 
the usage cases.
To eat my hat (or force others to do the same) I'm preparing a tree for 
threadlet test - I plan to write a trivial web server
(accept/recv/send/sendfile in one threadlet function) and give it a try
soon.
