I'm looking at mysql again today, but I will try eventually. It was
just a simple kbuild.

But desktop users could have have quad thread and even 8 thread CPUs
soon, so if the number doesn't work for both then you're in trouble.
It just smells like a hack to scale with CPU numbers.

I'd start by erring on the side of trying to ensure no obvious
performance regressions like this because that's the easy part. Suppose
everybody finds your scheduler wonderfully interactive, but you can't
make it so with a larger timeslice?
For _real_ desktop systems, sure, erring on the side of being more
interactive is fine. For RFC patches for testing, I really think you
could be taking advantage of the fact that people will give you feedback
on the issue.
