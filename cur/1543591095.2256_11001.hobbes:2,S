Wouldn't 
    struct block_device *b_bdev
be a better choice? (though you would need to fiddle with reference
counts then, so maybe not, I'm not sure).

Will this go into 2.4.X anytime soon? or is it 2.5 material?

I was assuming that this "disk" device was something that we could do
now, but if N==8, then we need more minor bits before it can be used
effectively, and that means lots of user-space changes doesn't it? So
it won't be in 2.4.

Uhm.  If I understand you correctly, you are saying that a single
major (the "disk" major) could have different partition sub-divisions
for different minor ranges.  e.g:
 minor 0-15 is partitions of first scsi drive
 minor 16-31 is partitions of second scsi drive
 minor 64-128 is partitions of first IDE drive
Is that what you mean?  I wouldn't want to have to maintain /dev/...

This is a topic that seems to be generating alot of discussion in these
threads.
Clearly each object (drive, partitions, filesystem, pointer, mouse,
framebuffer...) can potentially have several different names, each of
which may be valid in it's own context.  I think the kernel should
export all names equally without prejudice.
