Things got stranger. The symptoms started to appear on other connections
too (slashdot web for example). TCP bad packet count increased and no
success was made. I did a reboot with the same kernel (2.4.19+bk of some
state, 4. Aug probably) and it just started to work with the same kernel
image.
Now I will test and see if the symptoms appear again after some days.
