Agreed.
I even have a patch I'll submit to you which will get sparc64
converted over to using drivers/pci/setup-res.c so that none
of this kind of non-sense will occur in the future.
> Hm, how do you revert a git patch?
"patch -p1 -R" the patch, then use a changelog like:
[PCI]: Revert $(SHA1)
The $(SHA1) even shows up in gitk as a hyperlink so you can
see the original changeset and assosciated changelog entry
by just clicking on it.
