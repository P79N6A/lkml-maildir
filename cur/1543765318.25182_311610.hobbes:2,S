Where I am (in the UK) you more or less have to buy computers in bits
and put them together if you want (like I do) to shuffle bits of
hardware between different machines to suit varying needs or bolt on
extra bits and pieces of new hardware and above all not pay M$ tax.
The nvidia card seems the only one with reasonable performance at a
reasonable price that fits on most motherboards that I can find.in these
parts.

If I ask nicely can I download it from anywhere? I've just finished
building 2.6.11.7 and it might be nice to try it.
Could I possibly make a suggestion for "make xconfig" in the kernel tree
(and make other-kinds-of-config I suppose)?
I currently routinely copy the ".config" out of the previous kernel tree
before I start to save working through questions about sound cards I
never heard of and so forth.
Could it perhaps optionally initialise most of the settings to fit the
current machine and/or grab the last lot of settings
from /proc/config.gz?
