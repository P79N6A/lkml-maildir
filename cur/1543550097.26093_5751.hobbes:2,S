There is no Linux 6.2.  The newest version is a prerelease of 2.4.0.
Unlike other OSes you may be familiar with (e.g. FreeBSD), there is no
de facto standard distribution of kernel and apps -- there are half a
dozen major players and hundreds of minor ones, three quarters of which
are "Red Hat + some nifty add-on or service".
In any case, I suggest you look at a client for the 'finger' protocol,
which is just about as simple a TCP transaction as you can get.  Note
that the server is inetd-driven so has no networking code of its own.
I can't think of a simple TCP daemon that *isn't* inetd-driven, though.
If your Linux distribution is Debian-derived:
  $ dpkg -S /usr/bin/finger
  finger: /usr/bin/finger
So the package is called 'finger':
  $ cd /var/tmp; apt-get source finger

If your distribution is not Debian-derived, I don't know how to get the
source.  Ask your vendor.
