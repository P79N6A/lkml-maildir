Sigh. You meant more complicated not easier, right?
It is complicated enough now that you would really wish
for an object browser (and a box of aspirin) to read it. But anyways I guess
it was inevitable. 
I would rename __aquire/__release/etc. they are clearly name space
pollution and have even a specific meaning on IA64 which this
does not follow.
