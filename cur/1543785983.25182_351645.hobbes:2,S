Hans, unfortunately the most obvious reading of the above is "Reiser4 is so
damned fast because it doesn't bother doing sanity-checking".  If there's still
more "fixmes" to be inserted that *you* know of, and there are so many that
there's no time to fix them, why is this being submitted for inclusion?

This sort of claim requires proof - can you point at *specific* things that
were less stable after you fixed the code, including explaining why they're
less stable?
