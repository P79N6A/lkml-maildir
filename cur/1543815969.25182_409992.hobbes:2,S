I certainly like it and see a bennefit.
My situation is like this:
 A KDE desktop with OpenOffice, Lyx, Firefox, Eclipse, Gimp & a bunch
of xterms running more or less permanently.
 When I work on kernel stuff I often end up running "make clean ; make
allyesconfig ; make" and the build and especially final link of the
kernel usually kills the box for a while, so I tend to walk away and
come back a while later when it's done.
 Where I see the bennefit of swap prefetch is when I come back to my
box after such a build and pull one of my other running apps back to
the foreground. The apps come back noticably faster when I'm running a
swap prefetching kernel - we are not talking massive amounts of time,
just a few seconds, but it's enough for me to notice when I sometimes
happen to run a mainline kernel without swap prefetch.
