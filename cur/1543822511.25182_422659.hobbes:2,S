Yes, COWing is fine, I've no pagecache qualms if you go that way.

They'll be faulted in to insert probes, yes.

No, COWed pages can go out to swap.

exit_mmap frees process pages on exit and exec.

Depends on what semantics you want across fork.
Perhaps I don't understand, but you seem to be overcomplicating it,
seeing VM (mm) problems which would be automatically handled for you.
Wouldn't you just use ptrace(2) to insert and remove your uprobes?
See access_process_vm in kernel/ptrace.c for what that would do.
It goes on to get_user_pages to do the faulting and COWing.
