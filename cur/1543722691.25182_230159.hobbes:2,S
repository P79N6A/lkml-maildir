Please kill the ifdef completely.  As long as LANANA hasn't responded you
should only use the dyanic nimor, and once it's accepted there's no point
in using the dynamico ne anymore.  Also I'd sugges grabbing a whole dyanmic
major instead of using a miscdevice so the code both cases is more similar.
