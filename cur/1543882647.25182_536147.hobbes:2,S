Yeah I played with that for a bit last night to no good effect.
BUILD_BUG_ON simply becomes a noop if the optimiser doesn't really
really know that the thing its talking about is a real constant.
I assume that if it cannot be sure that it should constant fold the
number, it leaves it for runtime.  Then the optimiser sees that the
thing is void and therefore removable and removes it.  So no error.
Perhaps we need to enlist someone from gcc-land to tell us how to figure
out what its doing and massage it into working.
