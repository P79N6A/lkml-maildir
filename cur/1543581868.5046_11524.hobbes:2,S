There was not a bug in the driver.  The bug was/is in the protocol handling
code.  The protocol handling code *must* be able to handle unaligned IP
headers.

  - It's not just IPX hosts that send 802.3 headers.
  - While a good initial value might depend on the architecture, the
    best setting is processor implementation and environment dependent.
    Those details are not known at compile time.
  - The code path cost of a module option is only a compare and a
    conditional branch.
