Keeping a working unmaintained driver in the tree is not a big deal - we 
have hundreds of them.
But you miss the main point that removal of an obsolete driver with a 
new replacement driver forces people to finally report their problems 
with the new driver, thus making the new driver better.
After all, the people who scream loudly that the new driver doesn't work 
for them when the old driver gets removed are the people who should have 
reported their problems with the new driver many years ago...
