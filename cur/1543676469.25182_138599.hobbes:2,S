   It is rather unfortunate that this got called "PCI_xxx" since it has
   been used in a non pci-bus manner in (eg) the scsi layer.
I agree, the idea at the time that Jens and myself did this
work was that the generic device layer would provide interfaces
by which we could test this given a struct device.
