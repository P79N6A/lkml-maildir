ARMv6, something like:
int atomic_cmpxchg(atomic_t *ptr, int old, int new)
{
	u32 oldval, res;
	do {
		asm(
		"ldrex	%1, [%2]\n\t"
		"teq	%1, %3\n\t"
		"strexeq %0, %4, [%2]\n\t"
		    : "=&r" (res), "=&r" (oldval)
		    : "r" (&ptr->counter), "r" (old), "r" (new)
		    : "cc");
	} while (res);
	return oldval;
}
should do what you require.
