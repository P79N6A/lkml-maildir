Hi All,
I need your expert advice on the following issue:
I saw some messages on the Linux kernel mailing list about DLT 4000
tape drives.
We have a Quantum DLT 4000 1/15 drive connected to an HP9000 system.
This is a SCSI device connected on the Wide SCSI port. I have all kinds
of driver problems on the HP system. My tar backups abort randomly saying
media error.
I was wondering if I can connect the same drive to a Linux box having
wide SCSI interface. Do u think this is a workable proposition ? What
extra hardware/software I need to procure ? Please advise.
Thanks for your time.
Regards.
