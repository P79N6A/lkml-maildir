Have you tried enabling some of the debug options and the options that 
give you more verbose errors?  That might help diagnose what wrong. Just a 
guess, I don't know, but I'd try these options : 
CONFIG_SCSI_CONSTANTS
CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_ENABLE
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_DEBUG_MASK
CONFIG_AIC7XXX_REG_PRETTY_PRINT
read the help for those options to see what they do and how to use them.
