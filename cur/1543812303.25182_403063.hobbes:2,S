Heh. By Linus' Law, kernel footprint grows. To get a nice useable
floppy disk, you may need to do *quite* some jumps to make it fit.
In the worst case I had, I even started to throw out some of the
device ID tables (unneeded entries), killed printk() by defining a
no-op for it etc. to save some *bytes*. Yes, it's a nice dance:-)
