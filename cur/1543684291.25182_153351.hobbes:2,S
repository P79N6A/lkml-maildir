You can use the lock instruction ahead of any 386 instruction
without creating an exception. When relevent, it locks the whole
bus. When not, it's just a no-op. The trap on the lock instruction
came with the '486. With the '486, if the instruction doesn't
modify memory, then the lock prefix is invalid and will generate
an invalid-opcode exception.
It is not correct to use a lock instruction in front of every
op-code of course, and it might not have been tested for all
corner cases, but generally it's harmless on a '386.
The bad op-code for the i386 is cmpxchg. This is what triggers
the trap. This can be emulated, although the emulation is
not SMP compatible. You worry about this when somebody makes
a dual '386 machine ;^).  Also, the best performing emulation
for any op-codes should be done within the kernel. That way,
the invalid-opcode trap works just like the math emulator. You
don't need the overhead of calling a user-mode handler. If
this is emulation is implimented, then one should also emulate
BSWAP and XADD. This makes '486 code compatible with '386
machines.
