Subject: smp_call_function/flush_tlb_all hang on large memory system

On my 2.4.18 system, I am seeing a hang in
smp_call_function() when my machine is configured with
>2GB of RAM. Examining the call_data, it appears that
only 2 out of the other 3 cpus have responded to the
IPI (started == finished == 2). Examining eflags on
each of the cpus, shows that one of the cpus has
interrupts disabled (bit 9 was clear). However, that
cpu's stack does not show anything that would have
disabled interrupts, i.e. appears as if somebody
forgot to sti. Interestingly, manually setting that
bit (from kdb) will actually unwedge the system.
I always see smp_call_function() called from
flush_tbl_all(), which is usually called from
kmap_high; there has been one occassion when it was
called from vmfree_area_pages.

This hang is fairly reproducible when exercising NFS
(as shown above), e.g. repeatedly copying a large
file.
Browsing the web, I found a similar occurrence, but
didn't find a reply to the post:

Has anyone ever seen this or possibly have any ideas?
Please CC me directly on the response. Thanks in
advance.
