Trying with the above patch in now only get two "sleeping function
called from invalid context" warnings during boot and none during
running.  However I get a lot of those errors:
arch/um/drivers/line.c:262: spin_lock(arch/um/drivers/line.c:085b5900)
already locked by arch/um/drivers/line.c/262
Also both before and after the patch I see a lot of messages like:
kernel: line_write_room: tty2: no room left in buffer
Best regards,
        Anton
