hmm, so i'm working with a 2.4.1-ac20-TUX-P5 kernel and i can't find
"arpfilter" or "arp.*filter" in any of the files, so it doesn't appear to
have made it into 2.4.  i've been using the patch attached below and it's
solving the problem for me for now.  (it could be entirely wrong, but it's
letting me at least get some other work done :)
