And that's why I was saying I think UTF-8 mode is the "least broken" for
any filesystem that stores filenames in a specific encoding rather than
"as the client submitted it". And most especially for UCS-2/UTF-16
filesystems.
I think the default for a filesystem should be something that absolutely
will not disappear your files. So for NTFS/JFS, it should be UTF-8. And
if a traditional UNIX filesystem wants to do a UTF-8 only mode, I think
ideally it should be done at mkfs time rather than mount time.
