<nod> sqrt(N-1) is almost always the correct form, and gives the
"sample standard deviation". sqrt(N) (or the "population standard
deviation") should only be used when you can prove that you're not
doing any sub-sampling of the population at all, which is pretty much
never the case.
In practice, for any decent values of N, the difference between the
two is usually insignificant compared to everything else going on.

You rock.

Yup, these look good to me.

Right. At minimum, the average +- standard deviations of the glxgears
case tells a pretty consistent story, especially if one looks at the
deviation as a percentage of the average. (Mainline is far more
erratic than either SD or CFS, and CFS seems to be able to maintain
high throughput and low jitter.)
I'm not quite sure what to read into the fairness test, other than
mainline is obviously different for the other two in terms of
throughput. Deviations are across the board, but perhaps that's more a
reflection of how much (little) data was collected for this one?
Dunno.
Anyway, as you point out, the usefulness of the tests chosen could
still be up for debate, but I think you've shown that the results are
pretty stable, and at least can serve as a good measure between
versions of schedulers.
