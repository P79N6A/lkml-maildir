I sent to Alan Cox the "light" patch, but the "main" patch atm I think
it's best to remain the "full" one, for tests.

I'm not the author of the drivers, I only took them from the lirc cvs,
and make them compile under 2.5/6 series kernel.
AFAICS it should work also in-kernel, but I can't try because I can't
set bttv in-kernel, my card isn't autodetected. (Also, bttv author
suggest to don't compile bttv in-kernel, so depending on bttv, this
driver should be compiled as a module too).

This is a port of the drivers from lirc project (
http://lirc.sf.net/
),
I'm not going to rewrite it, also because the support for lirc in user
software is present in many programs, like xine, xawdecode, xmms (with
plugin) and so on.
The lirc_client library is simple and flexible, and the project is
consolidated, i don't see the need to change it, also because can be a
problem for backport in the 2.4 kernels.
