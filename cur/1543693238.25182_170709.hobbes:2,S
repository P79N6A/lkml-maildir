Hi all
I tried to use Compaq SDT-10000 tape drive with the lastest kernel, but I am getting these messages in kernel log:
st0: Failed to read 10240 byte block with 1024 byte transfer.
and it results in ENOMEM returned by read(). I haven't tried this type of tape under any other kernel version, but according to what I found on the net, it should work fine.
Thanks for all comments
