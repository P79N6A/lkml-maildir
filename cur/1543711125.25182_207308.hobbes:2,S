I don't think we should be averse to offering a couple of nice high-level
scheduler tunables.  But I do think we should have testing results which
clearly show that they provide some benefit, and we should agree that the
scheduler cannot provide the same benefit automagically.
Apologies in advance if we've seen those testing results and I missed it.
