Well in practice it just won't work at least at default page offset.

It doesn't need to. Just increase __VMALLOC_RESERVE by the
respective amount (end_pfn * sizeof(unsigned long))
Then 64GB still won't work in practice, but at least you made no such
assumption in theory @)
Also there is the issue of memory hotplug. In theory later
memory hotplugs could fill up vmalloc. Luckily x86 BIOS
are supposed to declare how much they plan to hot add memory later
using the SRAT memory hotplug area (in fact the old non sparsemem
hotadd implementation even relied on that). It would
be possible to adjust __VMALLOC_RESERVE at boot even for that. I suspect
this issue could be also just ignored at first; it is unlikely
to be serious.

Only on 32bit. Ok hacking it into all 32bit architectures might be
difficult, but I assume it would be ok to rely on the architecture
maintainers for that and only enable it on some selected architectures
using Kconfig for now.
On 64bit vmalloc should be by default large enough so it could
be enabled for all 64bit architectures.
