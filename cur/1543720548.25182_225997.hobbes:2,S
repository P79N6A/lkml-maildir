Subject: [PATCH] atiixp ac97 timeout gives error (2.6.7-rc2)

Hi,
I found that with 2.6.7-rc2 alsa refuses to recognize my atiixp
as a working sound card.
My atiixp is of a compaq nx9110 notebook.
pci stuff:
0000:00:14.5 Class 0401: 1002:4341
        Subsystem: 103c:006b
        Flags: bus master, 66MHz, slow devsel, latency 64, IRQ 5
        Memory at d0003000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
or:
0000:00:14.5 Multimedia audio controller: ATI Technologies Inc SoundMAX Integrated Digital Audio
I've patched the atiixp driver by ignoring the error when the
driver loads. If I recall correctly, this was the normal
behaviour in 2.6.5: a timeout warning was issued, but the "card"
functioned is it should.
If an alsa developer could point me to the "right" way, I can
make the patch a real patch.
