From my box:
pci 0000:00:1f.0: quirk: region d800-d87f claimed by ICH6 ACPI/GP IO/TCO
pci 0000:00:1f.0: quirk: region eec0-eeff claimed by ICH6 GPIO
pci 0000:00:1f.0: ICH7 LPC Generic IO decode 1 PIO at 0680 (mask 007f)
pci 0000:00:1f.0: ICH7 LPC Generic IO decode 4 PIO at 01e0 (mask 000f)
The second one shows up in /proc/ioports as "01e0-01ef : pnp 00:09", but the
first one (at 680) doesn't.
Thanks,
Rafael
