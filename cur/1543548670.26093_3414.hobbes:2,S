If I may ask a potentially stupid question, how can request latency be
anything but a factor of time?  Latency is how /long/ you (or the computer)
/waits/ for something.  That defines it as a function of time.
Just curious what the full comment being made is ...
... because I'm suspicious that the terms are being confused and there is
some discussion about reducing drive access latency within the context of
not moving the heads too much, etc. without the context of the user-space
application waiting for data.
