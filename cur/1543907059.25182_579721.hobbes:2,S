For efficient use of the bus it is useful to pad transfers to a multiple
of the block size.  I reckoned it was potentially beneficial for drivers
to use smaller blocks so less padding was required.  However, after
looking at some figures the per block overhead (28 clocks for a write)
really does limit the transfer sizes where small block sizes is beneficial.
I'll remove this.  Drivers can still override the block size by calling
sdio_set_block_size() directly.
