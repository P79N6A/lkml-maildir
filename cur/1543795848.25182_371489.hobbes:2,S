Well, it doesn't change any existing ABIs.

There are no plans that i Know of to disable them.
Also even if someone decided to disable them they could always
trap and emulate them.

For any kind of timers they should use the OS service 
(gettimeofday/clock_gettime). The OS will go to extraordinary
means to make it as fast as possible, but when it's slow
then because it's not possible to do it faster accurately
(that's the case right now modulo one possible optimization)
For cycle counting where they previously used RDTSC they should
use RDPMC 0 now.

There are obscure performance counters and then there are basic
fundamental performance counters. That particular counter hasn't
changed since the K7 days (and K6 didn't have performance counters) 
Intel also always had an equivalent one.  Unless they go to clockless
CPUs or something I think it's likely they will keep a counter like
this.
Also we'll let them know that we would like them to keep such a counter 
around.
You're right that many other performance counters are not so stable.
