Yes, IP in 2.2 really does not accept datagrams destined to another hosts
on MAC level. But it is _not_ a bug fix, it is just optimization to reduce
work on hosts monitoring network in promiscuous mode.
Nobody prohibited us to accept such frames locally, we must not
forward them, but we may accept them locally. The decision is made
on IP level and by IP address, MAC level details are inessential.
If you have duplicate IP addresses, it is bug in administration,
rather than in linux-2.0 kernel.
