Subject: [2.2.19 reiserfs] vs-8345: get_mem_for_virtual_node: kmalloc failed.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

This machine is has a 400MHz PII, Adaptec AIC-7895, 631 MB of memory,
and about 512 Meg of swap).
When compiling the kernel (2.2.19) I changed __FD_SETSIZE in
/usr/include/bits/types.h from 1024 to 8192.
(Increased number of file descriptors)
The following is executed at boot time:
# More file descriptors
echo 8192 > /proc/sys/fs/file-max
# Inodes 4x the file-max
echo 32768 > /proc/sys/fs/inode-max
# More user ports
echo 1024 32768 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
echo 768 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog
echo 120 >  /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_fin_timeout
And I started to see this recenty :

Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening ?
This (squid) server, serves about 50 requests/sec, so 2 minutes of downtime
means a lot of unhappy "customers".
