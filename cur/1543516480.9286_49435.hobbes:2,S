 hello,
    when mounting a CD into my cd-rom drive (crappy wearness 16x) kernel
 started outputting this message (hdd: lost interrupt) into the syslog and
 any access to any drive in the computer resulted in a hanging
 application. is there any way to solve this situation without having to
 reboot?
    thank you,
