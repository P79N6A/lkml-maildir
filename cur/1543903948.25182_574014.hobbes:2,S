Well, regardless, it still forces the function to treat the pointer
target as volatile, won't it? It definitely prevents valid optimisations
that would be useful for me in mm/page_alloc.c where page flags are
being set up or torn down or checked with non-atomic bitops.
OK, not the i386 functions as much because they are all in asm anwyay,
but in general (btw. why does i386 or any architecture define their own
non-atomic bitops? If the version in asm-generic/bitops/non-atomic.h
is not good enough then surely it is a bug in gcc or that file?)
Anyway by type safety, do you mean it will stop the compiler from
warning if a pointer to a volatile is passed to the bitop? If so, then
why don't we just kill all the volatiles out of here and fix any
warnings that comeup? I doubt there would be many, and of those, some
might show up real synchronisation problems.
