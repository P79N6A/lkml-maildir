I've been bisecting ACPI/suspend thinkpad issue myself and I seem to get
eea0e11c1f0d6ef89e64182b2f1223a4ca2b74a2 good,
cf4c6a2f27f5db810b69dcb1da7f194489e8ff88 bad.
At least this makes some sense since the log speaks about suspend.  Problem is,
ACPI issues are in rare cases going away for a while for me so this needs more
testing before I can say for sure about the good part - I already had one false
negative.  What I plan to do is using eea0e11c1f0d6ef89e64182b2f1223a4ca2b74a2
for a couple of days and see how this works out.
