Unless you are someone that sticks out from the crowd of engineers, you
are basically in trouble.  If your employer can't easily replace you
then you can negotiate a different employee contract.  This is quite 
common for a certain level of engineers.  I've done it and it is not
easy but one tip: describe the open source work as "pro bono work
for the community at large" and at least the lawyers will have a clue,
that's more or less their idea of open source.
