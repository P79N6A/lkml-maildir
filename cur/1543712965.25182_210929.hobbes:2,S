there were troubles with the header indeed. So I went back to the
pagecache version (now fixed with GFP_KERNEL and oom retval checking).
the oops I've got with the header trouble was weird (but at least the
previous radix_tree_delete crash is gone), so it's not completely clear
if this will be enough to make it work as well as it was working before
the -mm writeback changes. I tried to reproduce but apparently acpi is
doing nothing here for a echo 4 > sleep :/.
