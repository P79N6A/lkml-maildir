I have noticed this before but was just reminded of it.  When I am running
realplayer 5.0 (realaudio) and the network stream is congested enough that it
has to stop and rebuffer, I always get an error 1 (general unknown error) and
when I quit the application I get:
Audio write error. 480 bytes error #11
Audio write error. 736 bytes error #11
Audio write error. 426 bytes error #11
Audio write error. 898 bytes error #0
or something similar.  This does not happen with the commercial OSS.  I am using
a sound blaster 16 isa which is not pnp.  I don't remember having this problem
with 2.0 kernels but it's been a long time since I have used 2.0.x.  Though I
have been using the commercial drivers, it would be nice to be able to use the
free drivers and of course I would be glad to test any fixes.
