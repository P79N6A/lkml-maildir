Hello,
 After compiling kernel 2.4.16, I'v seen that I can't dcc chat bots
running on my local computer. I tried to see why its happening, and
couldn't get into any reasonable idea.
Yesterday I remembered that I compiled the 2.4.16 with the ip_nat_irc
module, and loaded it by default with my firewall. I rmmod ip_nat_irc and
suddenly I could dcc chat my local bots.
Q. Why is it happening?
Q. Am I using this module correctly? as far as I know, I just need to load
the module, and thats it, am I wrong? should I create some kind of rule
for it?
Q. Is it bug?
  Thanks,
        Ido Diamant
