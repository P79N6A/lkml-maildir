I just built this one, with RT but without the statistical stuff 
enabled.  While rc6 works fine with tvtime-0.99, this gives a no 
video blue screen, audio ok.
Its also found a phantom usb-serial-audio device and fouled up kmix 
with two devices to control.  This causes a slash thru the icon for 
kmix on the toolbar.  The lsusb -v output is many pages in length for 
this mis-identified device as I believe thats the vendor:product for 
a labtec webcam that is plugged in.  100% el-cheapo model.
config, dmesg saved if you'd like to see them.
