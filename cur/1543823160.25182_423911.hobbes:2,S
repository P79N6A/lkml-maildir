I think IBM summit somehow uses it too.
And there is a patch from Jeff Garzik I think to make the xw9300 subdomains 
work (or rather implement subdomain support in arch/i386/pci/*), but it 
breaks the Summit and possibly other non x86 systems. Greg 
should know details about that.
As usual the systems usually boot even without this patch, but you can't 
reach all PCI devices.

I think Greg has Jeff's patch still queued somewhere, but it needs
to be debugged to work everywhere. After that is done we can drop the blacklist 
entry. Hopefully for 2.6.19?
For 2.6.17 I don't see any alternative to blacklisting.
