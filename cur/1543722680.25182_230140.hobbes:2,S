Nice to see you working on this. I briefly looked into how to fix the same 
thing but didn't find the time to finish it. Here is what I thought; maybe 
it's useful to you.
There are local and remote locks, and both of them need a pid discriminator. 
We have used the files_struct pointer so far which was either a struct 
files_struct pointer or a struct nlm_host pointer. By using pointers we had a 
host+pid "uniquifier". Now we could change the fields from:
	struct file_lock {
		[...]
		fl_owner_t fl_owner;
		unsigned int fl_pid;
		[...]
	};
to:
	struct file_lock {
		[...]
		struct nlm_host *fl_host;	/* NULL for local locks */
		unsigned int fl_pid;
		[...]
	};
There would be no casting of other types into a fl_host here.
Cheers,
