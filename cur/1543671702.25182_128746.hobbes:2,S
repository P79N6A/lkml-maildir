The usual way of reading DVDs is to ignore all errors! You need
to handle DVD errors differently than CD/ROM errors. With CDs,
it is expected that all data that is read is perfect. With
DVDs, this is not the case. The implimentation problem becomes
one of how to tell the kernel that the combined DVD/CDROM is
one or the other. I don't know what W$ does about this, but
on my Compaq lap-top, DVDs just stream right along, even though
there are whole corrupted frames, while the same drive containing
a defective CD will retry practically forever.
