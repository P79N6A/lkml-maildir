Is LogFS really slower than JFFS2 in practice?
I would have guessed reads to be a similar speed, tree updates to be a
similar speed  to journal  updates for sustained  non-fsyncing writes,
and the difference unimportant for tiny individual commits whose index
updates are not merged with any other.  I've not thought about it much
though.
