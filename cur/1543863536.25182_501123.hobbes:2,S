  i'm pretty sure that's not going to happen this evening, but i
tweaked the script just a bit so you can run it (from the top-level
directory) against any subdirectory to see what CONFIG symbols appear
to be (for lack of a better word) "orphaned."
  let's test it against, say, fs/xfs:
$ ../config_vars.sh fs/xfs
FS_POSIX_CAP
FS_POSIX_MAC
XFS_DEBUG
XFS_DMAPI
XFS_TRACE
$ grep -r FS_POSIX_CAP .
fs/xfs/xfs_cap.h:#ifdef CONFIG_FS_POSIX_CAP
$ grep -r FS_POSIX_MAC .
./fs/xfs/xfs_mac.h:#ifdef CONFIG_FS_POSIX_MAC
$ grep -r XFS_DEBUG .
./fs/xfs/xfs.h:#ifdef CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG
./fs/xfs/Makefile-linux-2.6:ifeq ($(CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG),y)
and so on.  of course, there may be good reasons for some of these
variables to be there with no corresponding Kconfig entry -- i'm just
printing them out.
