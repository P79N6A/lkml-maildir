Nope, the manual map is needed. On x86-64 kernels are linked in the
"kernel" code model and the modules must be within 2GB of the main
kernel text.  vmalloc space is elsewhere.
To fix this you would need to link the modules with -fPIC and 
add a full dynamic linker to the module loader, which would
probably not be worth the effort.
