I've only been referring to checkpointing and keeping the file
in a consistent state. At the transaction level in shadow-paging there is copying of pages for separate changes. Another possibility is ensuring the undo log distinguishes changes by transaction id, and if a transaction doesn't pan-out then roll it back; saving pages with combined changes isn't necessarily a problem.
But as it happens :) as my db is rather a persistent object store and not intended for generalised db duty, I'm concentrating on the single transaction situation. This doesn't preclude concurrent transactions but if I do it they'll be in separate processes rather than threads.

So far all I do is mmap(READ) in whole file, trap SIGSEGV and mprotect(WRITE) once the individual modified pages, finally msync()'ing at checkpoints. I wouldn't say that was spending any length of time in the kernel! I'd forgotten about the 8/1 discrepency between pages and buffers and your comments have prompted an idea for an optimisation: when computing a page diff of changes, if the result spans less than some threshold then write() out the BUFSIZE bits rather than msync()'ing whole page. Unfortunately I don't think there's a way to reset the modified bit for a mmap()'ed page.
Thanks for your comments.
