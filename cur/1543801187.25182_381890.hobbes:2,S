This one's a bit of a hack - it pushes Sony hotkey magic stuff through
the ACPI layer for the sake of consistency, despite the fact that
there's not actually any ACPI involved. 
The "right" way is probably actually to push ACPI hotkey events through
the input layer (like the Sony code does without this patch), but that's
currently a bit more awkward to handle in userspace. Since the right
answer here is clearly "Fix userspace", we probably don't want to be
merging this.
(Disclaimer: I wrote it originally because it was easier than fixing
userspace...)
