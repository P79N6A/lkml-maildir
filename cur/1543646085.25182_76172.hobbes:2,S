I'm trying to tread as lightly as possible at first.  I wasn't sure
how well this kind of cleanup would be received ;-)  The trouble with
doing what you've asked immediately is that not all ->ioctl methods
return -ENOTTY.  Some return -EINVAL, some return -EOPNOTSUPP and some
return -ENOPKG.  Yeah, this should probably get cleaned up, but baby
steps first.  I have no Grand Plan here, but I do want to make things
a little more understandable before I embark on anything bigger.
