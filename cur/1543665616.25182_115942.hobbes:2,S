It's quite possible that even Linus doesn't have a clear cognitive grasp of
all the problems - Larry gave BK to Linus to prevent burn-out.  I'd not be
surprised if Linus was so busy dealing with the *first* order problems in
the pre-BK world (just getting patches to apply to his tree) that he never
encountered all the 'tough problems', and once he started using BK, he
also never hit any of the 'tough problems' because Larry's crew had already
spent 40 man-years making sure Linus *didnt* hit them.
