Yep, worked like a charm.  As it stands, I can't play DVDs on my laptop, 
but with this patch I can set combined_mode=libata and 
libata.atapi_enabled=1 and DVDs are no longer choppy.  It's great!

Ok, how does this one look?
Thanks,
Jesse
Combined mode sucks.  Especially when both libata and the legacy IDE 
drivers try to drive ports on the same device, since that makes DMA 
rather difficult.
This patch addresses the problem by allowing the user to control which 
driver binds to the ports in a combined mode configuration.  In many 
cases, they'll probably want the libata driver to control both ports 
since it can use DMA for talking with ATAPI devices (when 
libata.atapi_enabled=1 of course).  It also allows the user to get old 
school behavior by letting the legacy IDE driver bind to both ports.  
But neither is forced, the patch doesn't change current behavior unless 
one of combined_mode=ide or combined_mode=libata is passed 
on the boot line.  Either of those options may require you to access 
your devices via different device nodes (/dev/hd* in the ide case 
and /dev/sd* in the libata case), though of course if you have udev 
installed nicely you may not notice anything. :)
Let me know if the documentation is too cryptic, I'd be happy to expand 
on it if necessary.  I think most users will want to boot with 
'combined_mode=libata' and add 'options libata atapi_enabled=1' 
to their modules.conf to get good DVD playing and disk behavior 
(haven't tested CD or DVD writing though).
I'd much rather things behave sanely by default (i.e. DMA for devices on 
both ports), but apparently that's difficult given the various chip 
bugs and hardware configs out there (not to mention that people's 
drives may suddenly change from /dev/hdc to /dev/sdb), so this boot 
option may be the correct long term fix.
