I guess some UDP packets might be lost. It may happen easily as UDP protocol
doesn't support flow control.
Can you check how many errors has happened? 
You can see them in /proc/net/snmp of the server and the clients.
And how many threads did you start on your machine?
Buffer size of a UDP socket depends on number of kNFS threads.
Large number of threads might help you.
