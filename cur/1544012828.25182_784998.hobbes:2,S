hm, will re-test and see whether i can get more debug info out of the 
system.

this reminds me, i dont particularly like the way you added a 
self-interrupt:
+       __send_IPI_shortcut(APIC_DEST_SELF, MCE_SELF_VECTOR, 0);
IPI self-sends are generally more fragile than task-flag based methods, 
and they also waste IRQ vector real-estate.
