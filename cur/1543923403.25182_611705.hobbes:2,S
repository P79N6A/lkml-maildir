The Smack development has benefited greatly from comments, suggestions,
and bug reports from members of the SELinux community. Further, I have
had no trouble whatever sharing the netlabel component with SELinux.
Audit is another matter as it requires some work to get the SELinux
dependencies out, but everyone's been receptive to proposals there.
Why on earth would I want some 'model maintainer' passing judgements
on my work in progress? The only thing I can imagine a 'model
maintainer' doing is obstructing innovation. Unless it was me, of
course. Linus is right, you know.
