As I said in what you snipped, I believe your debug there is showing
up an existing problem on my machine, not a problem in your changes.

I think Mr __NickPiggin_Lock is squirming ever more desperately.
So, in essence, you'd like to expand PG_locked from 1 to 8 bits,
despite the fact that page flags are known to be in short supply?
Ah, no, you're keeping it near the static mmzone FLAGS_RESERVED.
Hmm, well, I think that's fairly horrid, and would it even be
guaranteed to work on all architectures?  Playing with one char
of an unsigned long in one way, while playing with the whole of
the unsigned long in another way (bitops) sounds very dodgy to me.
I think I'd rather just accept that your changes have slowed some
microbenchmarks down: it is not always possible to fix a serious
bug without slowing something down.  That's probably what you're
trying to push me into saying by this patch ;)
But again I wonder just what the gain has been, once your double
unmap_mapping_range is factored in.  When I suggested before that
perhaps the double (well, treble including the one in truncate.c)
unmap_mapping_range might solve the problem you set out to solve
(I've lost sight of that!) without pagelock when faulting, you said:

but that didn't give me enough information to agree or disagree.

i386 (2*HT P4 Xeons), x86_64 (2*HT P4 Xeons), PowerPC (G5 Quad).
Workloads mostly lmbench and my usual pair of make -j20 kernel builds,
one to tmpfs and one to ext2 looped on tmpfs, restricted to 512M RAM
plus swap.  Which is ever so old but still finds enough to keep me busy.
