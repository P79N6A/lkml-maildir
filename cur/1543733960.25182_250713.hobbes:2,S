Though, if this is an actual lock latency (as opposed to merely being
a page-fault latency suffered by the task swapping something in), it
could affect mlockall'd processes as well due to some other task
swapping.
One way to fix the latency would be to turn the locks involved into
sleeping mutexes.  There's a comment in the code saying that swaplock
cannot be turned into a semaphore, but it does not say why; if this
is due to it nesting in other locks, those locks would need to be
converted as well.  It could turn into quite a mess doing it
manually, though turning all spinlocks into mutexes (except
hand-chosen exceptions) should take care of it.
