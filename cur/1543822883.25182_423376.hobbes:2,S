I do think the mount/umount events are valid and interesting, so I'd much 
rather see the second version.
However, that does beg the question: wouldn't that effectively be what the 
patch I posted would do? Notably the "disk->driverfs_dev = NULL" part 
after we've dropped it (the "KOBJ_REMOVE" event move is a separate issue, 
mixed here into the same patch, but should result in possibly better name 
generation for the event).
Basically, onces driverfs_dev has been dropped, we NULL it out, and then 
the people who use it automatically get the right result.
Yes? No? "You're a total klutz, Linus, that patch won't actually do 
anything, because <xyz>"?
