You are wrong using pejorative labeling "commercial sound system" for 
this. Comercial is implementation. OSS is defined by user space API.
This is all what was neccessary on implemting this in for Linux.
OSS case on Linux is very simillar to Motiff case on X11.
As same as Motiff OSS have publically avalaible and open specyfication
avalaible on 
http://www.opensound.com/pguide/oss.pdf
 which do not touch 
kernel level implemntations details. Using this specyfication you can
collect all neccessary details for implemt handle /dev/* interface on
kernel side.
