and if I do this
struct _MY_DUMMY_STRUCT{
         int    blabla;
         char   huge_buff[1000000];
         ...}
ThisDummyStruct =   (struct _MY_DUMMY_STRUCT*)v(k)malloc(sizeof(struct 
_MY_DUMMY_STRUCT),)
????
is there a crash risk?
I also do something like this
on the user side
ioctl(fd,MY_IOCTL,ThisCode) where Thiscode is a pointer to a 400k buffer
and here the kernel code
case MY_IOCTL:
 memcpy_fromfs((void *)ThisDummyStruct->huge_buff,(void *)arg,(SIZEOF 
400K_Buffer));
is it dangerous ? deadly?
Thanks
Fabien
