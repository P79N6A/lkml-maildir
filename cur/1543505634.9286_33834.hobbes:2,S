For Zorro, we removed /proc/zorro and the kernel name database after we
introduced /proc/bus/zorro and zorroutils.
We still have to implement the resource thing for Zorro, but we agreed to keep
only the `most common' cards (i.e. the ones for which we have a Linux driver)
in the name database. I guess the others will be named `Zorro <slot>'.
