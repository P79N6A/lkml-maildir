  I'm not sure if this is the issue. Usually the cross compilers on MS windows
expects windows file path "c:\" where as the cygwin makefile uses unix path "/".
You can verify that with verbose output of the commmand line of your cross 
compiler to see what path is been used to fetch the file fixdep. 
You could try giving windows absolute path.
