I would just like to make anybody aware that since
2.3.33 the support for the parport variant of this
device appears to be broken. Apparently in the driver
is compiled as a module it doesn't get past the 
initialization. In esp. modprobe ppa hangs in the uninitialized
state of the module without any end and possibility to kill the loader.
Which in fact is by the way showing some kind of possible race inside
the modularisation as itself. But ... that's another story.
