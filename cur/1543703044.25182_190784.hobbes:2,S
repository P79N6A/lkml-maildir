Indeed, md does this with partitions on the disks today, so it is
analogous; DDF does this with disk extents, which has the same
functionality as partitions, but without an MSDOS partition table to
define the partitions, but an on-disk metadata format (yes, partition
tables are metadata too...). 
The solution needs partitions/extents in two places.
1) below the logical drive, from which logical drives are created.
2) above the logical drive, on which multiple file systems are
created.
md provides 1) today, and as discussed today patches exist to do 2)
that have not yet been merged.
