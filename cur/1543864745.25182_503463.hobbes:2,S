That's the one scaring me in fact ... Maybe it will end up being an easy
one but I don't feel too comfortable... we didn't create fibril-like
things for threads, instead, we share PIDs between tasks. I wonder if
the sane approach would be to actually create task structs (or have a
pool of them pre-created sitting there for performances) and add a way
to share the necessary bits so that syscalls can be run on those
spin-offs.
