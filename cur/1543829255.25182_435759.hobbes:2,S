Okay, so you've got a point. The patch is useful on k6 in the winter
:-). (Actually, to show you've got a point, you'd have to stop the fan
and show that cpu badly overheats under for(;;) conditions).
Yes, we probably want to consolidate various for(;;) loops... and
maybe it will helpsomeone. If overheating causes reboot instead of
panic, you probably still loose, as BIOS is close to for(;;)...
