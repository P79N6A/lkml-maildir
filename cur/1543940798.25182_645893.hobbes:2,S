This depends on how you can turn the UPS back on...
If pushing the button manually is not an issue or the UPS
can still be controlled remotely (e.g. via network) when
being off it doesn't matter.

All systems I've seen that provide such an option in the BIOS
list three possible actions on power-back:
- remain off
- go back to previous state
- boot
In your case it's possibly easier to choose the option to
always boot when power comes back.

Can you configure your UPS to poweroff when load on its output
drops below a given threshold? (I know that such a feature
exists on master-slave power outlets where all slave outlets
are powered only when the master outlet has a sufficient load)
Another path may be to dig into hibernate via kexec:

Can't the UPS software trigger scripts or be controlled
using scripts?
