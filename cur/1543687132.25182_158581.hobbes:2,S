Sounds fairly ugh, actually.  It might be better to just implement
fadvise().
O_STREAMING is really designed for large streaming writes; the current
implementation only performs invalidation after each megabyte of I/O, so it
would fail to do anything at all in the lots-of-medium-size-files case
such as rsync.
Or use 2.6.  It will take a while for the feature to usefully propagate into
applications anyway...
