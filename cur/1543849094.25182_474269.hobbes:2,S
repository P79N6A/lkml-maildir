I have yet to find a _single_ app that really uses sysctl, actually. Can 
you name one?
There's apparently some library functions that has used it in the past, 
and I've seen a few effects of that:
	warning: process `wish' used the removed sysctl system call
but the users all had fallback positions, so I don't think anything 
actually broke.
(The situation may be different with older libraries, which is why it's 
still an option to compile in sysctl. None of the machines I had access 
to cared at all, though).
