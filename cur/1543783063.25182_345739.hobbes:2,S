Ingo,
This patch contains my previous change as well as an update to fix the
race conditions that the BKL may hold.  It is against -rt2. 
The first part of the patch will stop the pi_setprio loop if the process
has a lock_depth greater than or equal to zero.  Since that would mean
that the process either is running, or is about to release the BKL.
I still kept the change from rt1 to rt2 but changed the comment.
I added the lock release logic in the __up code incase the BKL is
causing loops in the pi chain.
I'm currently runnig -rt2 with these changes as I type.
