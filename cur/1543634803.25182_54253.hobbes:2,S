It's not wrong, it's just makes life interesting when you want 
accurately represent the presence of the device via both paths, or you 
want to deal with the removal or power management of the bridge device. 
That problem needs to be addressed; soon.

You can very well use driverfs to expose those attributes, and is one of 
the things that we've been discussing at the kernel summit. driverfs will 
take over the world. But, I still think the device is best represented as 
a child of the phsysical network device.

The bus_id of the device is intended to represent the bus-specific ID of 
the device, and is the name of the driverfs directory. 
The name should user-friendly. It shouldn't be a unique name. Use 
something nice and pretty. If people need/want a UUID, add it to the 
bus-specific or type-specific structure, and export it via driverfs. It 
will eventually make it to the generic structure.
