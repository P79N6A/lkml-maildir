I think this is the cpufreq problem wherein it sometimes requires that the
notifier chain be traversed from atomic context and at other times it
requires that sleeping functions be callable from within the traversal. 
IOW: we're screwed whatever type of locking we use on that chain.
I think Alan is cooking up a scheme wherein we fix this with an srcu-locked
notifier chain.  If so, it'd be nice to get that moving along a bit?
If not, I'm not sure what the fix is - perhaps create a second notifier
chain which has the same contents but uses a different locking approach?
