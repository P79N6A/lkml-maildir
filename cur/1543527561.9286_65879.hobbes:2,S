Subject: [PATCH] to allow SYSRQ to work with odd keyboards.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/2/26/37

Attached is a patch for 2.2.14 to allow SYSRQ to work on odd
keyboards that send the SYSRQ make and break codes simultaneously
when the key is pressed, and send nothing when the key is
released.  The M-Tek K208 keyboard that I own works in this
fashion for example, and because of that I have not ever been
able to use SYSRQ - until now.
I tried various solutions to this problem, and believe I've come
up with the simplest solution which allows my keyboard to work
with SYSRQ, in addition to keeping the existing behavior.
I'd like it if as many of you as possible can please apply this
patch to 2.2.14 and test it out.  If there are any problems,
report them to me, perhaps with a suggested solution.  If all
goes well, which I suspect it will, I'll tidy it up as per
suggestions, and submit it for 2.2.1[56], and port to 2.3.4[78]
as well.
echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq  - gives the existing behavior,
in which my keyboard does not work with SYSRQ.
echo 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq  - changes the behavior so that
the SYSRQ "break" code is ignored, and the ALT key's break code
is used instead to break out of SYSRQ.
Normal keyboards work ok with either 1 or 2, however broken
keyboards like mine only work with "2".
I have tested the patch out on 2 different systems, with a good
keyboard and a bad one, both with echo 1, and echo 2, and all
appears to work well.  I haven't had any problems so far, so if
anyone else does, I'd like to hear about it.  
Check for KERN_DEBUG messages in your logs if you have problems, 
and please send them to me.

 You need to say "yes" to 'Magic SysRq key (CONFIG_MAGIC_SYSRQ)' when
 configuring the kernel. This option is only available in 2.1.x or later

+0 - disable SysRq
+1 - enable SysRq
+2 - enable SysRq for broken keyboards like the Mtek K208 that send both
