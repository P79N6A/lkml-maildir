A related idea was reportedly used in the Venti filesystem, which was
discussed on linux-kernel back in October; look for the thread
"Transparent compression in the FS".
The downsides are pretty substantial (but the upsides are too).  You
don't know how many blocks are available on the filesystem for you to
write, because when you write you might not allocate blocks.  And you
lose disk-streaming-perfomance, because you're going to be seeking all
over the disk picking up the blocks for your files.

I don't know about you, but I don't have 15 nearly identical copies of
the kernel; I have 30 copies that have almost no text in common, and
certainly have no blocks in common -- they result from independent
compilations, and the resulting bzImage files are not duplicates.
