Why? Can't you use a small initramfs to set it up?

Current spiritual successor is Ingo's realtime patchset I guess.

What would these be? Some proc or sysfs files that were removed or
renamed?
Maybe they can be worked around w/o changing the application at all, or
very minor changes.
Also, be sure to check if there are pauses with other CPU hogs.

Yes, adding an initramfs is non-trivial (some busybox + shell
scripting), but not all that hard either.
And maintaining one is easier than patching the kernel.
(usually 0 maintenance, maybe minor fixes sometimes)
