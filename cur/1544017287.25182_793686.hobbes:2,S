Hmm, someone reported something similar before too. You don't need to 
worry, but this is one of the function tracer self tests failing. In which 
case, you will loose the ability to use the function tracer.
What happen is that on boot up, the dynamic function tracer will convert 
all calls to mcount into a nop. When it does this, it does several self 
checks to make sure it is not destroying anything, (remember a e1000e 
bug?)  If it detects anything abnormal, it aborts and this is one of those 
detections triggering.
When it went to modify the location to the call of mcount in 
acpi_thermal_notify into a nop, it checked to see if that loctation was 
indeed a call to mcount. But it was not. Instead it was already a nop!
This means that it somehow converted the acpi_thermal_notify twice, and 
the second time it failed because it was not what it expected.
If you still see this on boot up, could you cat out:
# mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
# cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/dyn_ftrace_total_info
And perhaps, if possible, could I get a copy of the vmlinux that was 
built, and a CONFIG to go with it.
Thanks,
