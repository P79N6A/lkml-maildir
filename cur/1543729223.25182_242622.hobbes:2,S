How do you define the split. There are lots of circumstances where user
pages can be pinned for a long (near indefinite) period of time and used
for DMA.
Consider
- Video capture
- AGP Gart
- AGP based framebuffer (intel i8/9xx)
- O_DIRECT I/O
There are also things like cluster interconnects, sendfile and the like
involved here.
