There currently is a slight name space collision "(deleted)" is a valid
filename, but you could change it to //deleted/mount/inode or some such
to avoid that.
I just assume that /proc is in place, just like near all Linux programs
in existence assume that /etc is in place and contains certain files, or
networking assumes that you once did ifconfig lo. If you didn't, bad luck.
