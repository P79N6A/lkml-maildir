I use an IA64 machine with page size of 16 Kbytes.
I allocate a single page (for simplicity) when I copy in from user space
the list of the addresses (2048 of them fit in a page).
One page of PTEs maps 32 Mbytes.
16 pages (which map 512 Mbytes) eat up my L2 cache of 256 Kbytes
(and the other data, the stack, the code, etc...).
Sure I have an L3 cache of at least 3 Mbytes (new CPUs have bigger L3 caches)
but it is much slower than the L2.

Yes I see.

My machine consists of 4 "Tiger boxes" connected together by a pair of Scalability
Port Switches. A "Tiger box" is built around a Scalable Node Controller (SNC), and
includes 4 Itanium-2 processors and some Gbytes of memory.
The CPU clock runs at 1.3 GHz. Local memory access costs 200 nanosec.
The NUMA factor is 1 : 2.25.
An OpenMP benchmark uses 1 Gbytes of memory and runs on 16 processors,
on 4 NUMA nodes.
If the benchmark is adapted to our NUMA architecture (local allocations by hand),
then it takes 86 seconds to complete.
As results are not accepted if obtained by modifying the benchmark in any
way, the best we can do is to use a random or round robin memory allocation
policy. We end up with a locality rate of 25 % and the benchmark executes in 121
seconds.
If we had a zero-overhead migration tool, then - I estimate - it would complete
In 92 seconds (the benchmark starts in a "pessimized" environment, and it takes
time for the locality ramp up from 25 % to almost 100 %).
Actually it takes 2 to 3 seconds to move 750 Mbytes of memory (on a heavily
loaded machine), reading out the counters of the SNCs and making some quick
decisions take 1 to 2 seconds, and we lose about 10 seconds due to the buggy
SNCs. We end up with 106 seconds.
(I keep holding the PGD lock, no re-scan while moving the max. 2048 pages.)
Inverting the inner - extern loops, i.e. for each page, I scan the PGD-PMD-PTE,
and the PGD lock is released between the scans, I have 10 to 12 seconds
spent on the migration (not counting the 1 to 2 seconds of the "AI" + ~10 seconds
due to the buggy SNCs.)
Thanks,
Zoltán
