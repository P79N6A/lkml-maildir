There are these logical devices as you mentioned plus (optional) joystick 
or IDE controler which the sound driver doesn't drive.

No, but that's not the point. The sound driver must grab all devices to 
follow hardware structure.
3.)  Are there any other isapnp cards that depend on multiple devices per
driver, to my knowledge only a limited set of sound cards do.
Almost all isapnp soundcards. The opl3sa2 driver is an exception. Try to 
grep for ISAPNP_DEVICE_ID in linux/sound/isa directory + subdirectories.
Anyway, as I said. The card is bus (PCI has something similar - PCI 
bridges).
