Check your calendars, the year 2000 is a leap year, February has 29 days.  The
rule for determining whether a year is a leap year is as follows:
	if the year is divisible by 4 it IS a leap year,
	if the year is divisible by 100 it is NOT a leap year,
	if the year is divisible by 400 it IS a leap year.
That's it.  There is no Feb 30 in any year so let's put this joke to rest.
