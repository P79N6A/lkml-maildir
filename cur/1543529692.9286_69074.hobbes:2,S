I believe this is the correct solution. It implies exactly _one_
privileged task, whose job is to decide the privileges of all the rest.

Nope. It isn't. It's unacceptable in practice.
I run labs. The lab machines have to have defenses against
_themselves_. First line defence: system daemons restarted by
init if killed. Second line: daemons restarted by cron-based checks
(cron has to be maintained from init) at regular intervals. Third
line: software watchdog checking mem use and ready to pull machine
to runlevel s and back up again if conditions not rectified.
Even so, I get reports every couple of days from machines that 
have obviously killed themselves. I just got one from a cron
telling me it had restarted the software watchdog, for goodness'
sake! (amongst others: rpc.nfsd and rpc.mountd seem to be favourites).
