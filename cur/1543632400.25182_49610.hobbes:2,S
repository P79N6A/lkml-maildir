I did now two more tests. The kernel reacted nearly as described above. 
The malicious process was killed but one time unfortunately xosview, 
too. I always tried to open a new ssh session, wich always worked. Even 
  innd was able to server some news-postings :-).
If the kernel always only would kill the malicious process, it would be 
really great and probably the solution of a really big problem of 
2.4.-kernels!

The problems of resync always occure if the rsync-process on the other 
side is stoped with CTRL-C e.g. At this moment, the ssh-connection to 
the host susi is closed, which rsync obviously can't handle correctly.
That's why it's very easy for me to reproduce the situation and how the 
kernel is acting.

Andreas Hartmann
