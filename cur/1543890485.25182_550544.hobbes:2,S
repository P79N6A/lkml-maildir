OK, so we must open the V4L2 API to add a custom pixel format.
While brainstorming, I thought it would be funny to create userspace 
drivers like FUSE based projects do.
Applications would see nothing but a new device driver to access, all 
decompression algorithm would be in userspace.
The path from the application to the v4l2 kernel driver:
[Application]<->[/mnt/video0 (created by FUSE-like userspace 
lib)]<->[/dev/video0 (created by kernel v4l2 driver)]
There are limitations that I don't know, but this would be transparent 
for the applications.

So we have a userspace lib that will demux/uncompress device driver output.
This lib will know each device driver particularities to know how to 
demux/uncompress in a a/v format that will be understood by the application.
