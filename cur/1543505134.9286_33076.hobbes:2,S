To prevent any packets from being IP-fragmented (not to be mistaken
with TCP segmentation) *before* they arrive at the virtual IPSEC I/F.
If they are pre-fragmented and we transport encrypt those fragments, the
destination will attempt to re-assemble individually encrypted
fragments rather than decrypting the fragments, then re-assembling
them.  We have no way to tell the destination the order of
re-asssembly/decryption.  They should always be re-assembled before
decryption.  To solve this, we encrypt the entire packet, then
fragment it.  To avoid pre-fragmenting, we set the virtual MTU high
and the physical MTU to normal.
Each ESP, AH or IPIP IPSEC header adds anywhere from 20 to 28 octets
to the packet size, and all three may be added.

If we don't lie, we have to re-assemble the fragments, encrypt,
re-fragment in transport mode.

We can still respond to DF packets while giving a large MTU.  The
large MTU is for the benefit of ICMP, UDP, IGMP, etc. which don't do
PMTUD.

I will have to digest this paragraph...

I will have to check the IPSEC RFCs to see what happens here.  IPSEC
is mandatory in a compliant IPv6 implementation.

Can you suggest another way to send a ping of 2000 octets over a
transport mode connection with a physical MTU of 1500?
