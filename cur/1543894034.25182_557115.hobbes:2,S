If that happened I'd be lost. I've tried the various BSD's and found they had 
problems with hardware support and getting a new version of the BSD kernel to 
compile and boot is something of a black art.
The point is moot, though. It can never happen.

As much as the US "Declaration of Independence" and other sources want people 
to believe otherwise there is no such thing as "inalienable rights" 
or "inalienable freedoms". In this case I have been unable to find 
this "inalienable freedom" to run custom versions of software "on the same 
machine" that you received the original copy on anywhere before the GPLv3 - 
and even then it isn't explicitly clear. There is no restriction on your 
right to modify, copy, distribute or run the software as provided by versions 
of the GPL prior to version 3. If this "run modified copies on the same 
hardware you received the original on" *IS* the "spirit" of the license, then 
why isn't it stated anywhere before GPLv3? (After all, the FSF has have 20+ 
years to mention it)

I'll grant you that. But, at this point, where can I find a copy of the GPLv1 
without having to dig around the net ?

And because its a device that connects to their network - and TiVO isn't a 
telecommunications company - they have the right to upgrade and configure the 
software inside however they want. (In the US at least)

Point. But once again - would a company pay attention to that fact?

True. But that doesn't save them from lawsuits trying to force them to obey 
the terms of the new revision even though they received the software under an 
earlier version.

And his interpretation is no less valid than that of anyone else. In fact, 
after a recent conversation with a couple of lawyers that I know, I can state 
that his interpretation isn't that far off from theirs.

Then you're lucky. I've had a lot of people say something similar to the 
following: "Oh, I've heard about that. So which version of the GNU-Linux 
kernel are you running?"

Yes, it does. While pronouncing the '/' or '+' sounds a bit odd it does get 
the point across that it's the GNU userspace running on top of the Linux 
kernel. (as does "GNU on Linux")

As I've stated before - I can find nothing in the history of the GPL or the 
FSF that makes the "on the same hardware" requirement clear and part of 
the "spirit" of "Free Software". The closest anything comes is the "printer 
driver" that was the (in)famous "last straw" for RMS and caused him to create 
the FSF and the GNU Project.

Shouldn't matter. As I've repeated quite a bit I cannot find a single mention 
that "on the same hardware" has been a goal of the FSF or part of 
the "spirit" of the GPL at any point before the drafting of GPLv3.

Legal requirements in some countries that require manufacturers to provide 
support for their product for a period of time after it has been purchased.

*thinks* Okay - looks like I had a thinko there. Arguments on this subject 
(ie: the theoretical hardware) are withdrawn and the point is conceded.
