If you use a buggy program, that had a hidden bug now exposed because 
of different kernel checks, dont complain, and use your brain.
If you do
$ export VAR1=" A very very very very long chain just to be sure my 
environnement (which is placed at the top of the stack at exec() time) 
will use at least 4 Kb  : then my litle buggy program will run if I 
type few chars but destroy my stack if I type a long string or if I 
use : cat longfile | ./xxx : So I wont complain again on lkml that I 
am sooooo lazy. Oh what could I type now, I'm tired, maybe I can copy 
this string to others variables. Yes... sure...."
$ export VAR2=$VAR1
$ export VAR3=$VAR1
$ export VAR4=$VAR1
$ export VAR5=$VAR1
Then check your env size is large enough
$ env|wc -c
    4508
$ ./xxx
./xxx 2>/dev/null
Apparently the kernel thinks 4096 is a good length!
So what ? Your program works well now, on a linux-2.6.11 typical 
machine. Ready to buffer overflow again.
Maybe you can pay me $1000 :)
