I think it should protect against any dynamic memory usage during early
boot phase too till we reach a point where kernel is aware of BIOS provided
memory maps and kernel memory area usage can be controlled with the help
of BIOS provided/User defined memory maps.
In i386 implementation Eric is alredy taking into account the memory
used by bootmem bitmap and initial page tables. I have not looked into
x86_64 kernel code whether do I need to make such adjustments. It worked
for me so did not bother much. I will look into it.
Thanks
