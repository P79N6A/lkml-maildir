Sorry, I should mention earlier that this is Wyse 3360SE. I don't know how to 
enter BIOS (if there is any).

I will give up. I didn't checked code earlier. This driver is using SMM. Probably  
firmware isn't what it should be, or I have overwritten it when I was flashing 
Linux. I see in datasheet that it isn't possible to write driver in other way. 
Sadly sound card is generating SMI only.
