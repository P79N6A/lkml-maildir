Hmm.  I think this will require one of the kernels to run at a
non-default address in physical memory.

And at this point I don't quite see why you would need /dev/hmem,
as opposed to just using /dev/mem.
Or will the crashing kernel save and compress the core dump to
somewhere in ram and the dump kernel read it out from there?

Which will largely depend on the quality of it's device drivers...

I'm sorry I missed you then.  Unfortunately this is my busiest season at work
so I wasn't able to make it to OLS this year :(
Does anyone have a proof of concept implementation?  I have been able to find
a little bit of time for this kind of thing lately and have just done
the x86-64 port.  (You can all give me a hard time about taking a year
to get back to it :)  I am in the process of breaking everything up
into their individual change patches and doing a code review so I feel
comfortable with sending the code to Andrew.  So this would be a very
good time for me to look at any code for reporting a crash dump with
a kernel started with kexec.
