FWIW, I need this patch as well for as part of porting Andreas's ACL
code to 2.5.  So if it doesn't get accepted, I'll be resubmitting it
as part of the ext 2/3 ACL patch set...  
(the patch was developed and agreed upon between the XFS team and
Andreas Gruenbacher, so it's part of the ext 2/3 ACL patches.)
