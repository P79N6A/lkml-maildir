I believe the problem caused by the sound drivers not compiling under
2.3.50 can be fixed with the following patch.  I am not sure why the
MI*OBJ macros were commented out, but this caused sound_syms.o and sb.o
to be compiled without the -DEXPORT_SYMTAB option.
The patch to remove the gross hack mentioned above in sb_common.c is
left as an exercise to the reader.
