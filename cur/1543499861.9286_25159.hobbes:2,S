OK guys... I need a journaling filesystem, I guess.
Actually, what I need is a lot of money so that I can get myself a
computer that doesn't have a flawed CPU in it... but I don't have that
money.
Every so often, at an unpredictable rate, the system will completely
*HALT*.  Cold freeze.  It does this under DOS too, and there are no
hardware comflicts, so the only thing that I can assume is that it is the
processor.  Well, I was told that this was a flaky processor when I got
it, anyway... it's an Evergreen 5x86 133MHz.
In any case, I need to know what available options are available as far as
a journaling filesystem and what kernel version I need to add the
supporting patch for it... I can't be waiting for 15 minutes while fsck
goes through and checks my partitions.
So, what I need is such a filesystem that will allow me to run and if my
computer shits then all I gotta to is wait for it to pick up where it left
off...
Also, is there an ext2 --> journaling fs convertor, or will I have to
reinstall Linux to the journaling fs, say, using a kernel patch on the
kernel that installs linux?  Doesn't matter to me either way, actually,
but I need to know so that I can attempt to back up my data then and be
able to reinstall.
Thanks for any help that you can give me on this... this problem is
*really* getting on my nerves, and as I said, I don't have the money to
fix it, so I'll have to go this method. =/
