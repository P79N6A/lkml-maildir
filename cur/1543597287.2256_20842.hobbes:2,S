Hi,
is anybody know a problem with the ls, auto-completion... commands and a SGI 
partition mounted on LInux 2.4.x kernel ?
in our lab', home directories are mounted from SGI to redhat 7.0 pc.
if i make a 'ls -al' of a directory, i have the list of all files in this 
directory.. but if i make a ls *, some files (or directories) are missing. 
This problem is only with 2.4.x kernels. We have compiled 2.4.3, 2.4.5 and 
2.4.6 kernel with the same problem. When we reboot the same machine
on 2.2.16 (or 2.2.19) kernel, problem is gone. This problem is retrieve on 
redhat 7.0 (with 2.4.x kernel), redhat 7.2 (2.4.2 kernel) and Mandrake 8 
(2.4.3 kernel).
We retrieve this problem with gnome softwares but not with KDE softwares ! 
(no relation with the windows manager).
If we make a copy of a problematic directory in another directory on the 
mounted disk (or on the local HD) problem is gone. We don't have 
problems on the local disk.
any idea ?
best regards,
