This casts away volatile -> gcc generates potentially faster code

Grepped your patch for uses of jiffies_hi_shadow, found none
except for stores. Seems to be unused?

Looks like gross overkill for 64bit i++. I see no flaw in much simpler:
+	if(++jiffies == 0) {
+		/* barrier(); --vda: needed? I have some doubts... */
+		jiffies_hi++;
+	}
To avoid races 64bit readers must read in reverse order: hi,lo,check hi;
your patch already does this just right:

This belongs to some .h file, not .c (most likely include/linux/sched.h)
Also consider 
+#if defined(CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL)
+/* Rollover in 1000 secs */
+#define INITIAL_JIFFIES ((unsigned long) -1000*HZ)
+#else
+#define INITIAL_JIFFIES 0
+#endif
Hope your patch will go into mainline soon!
