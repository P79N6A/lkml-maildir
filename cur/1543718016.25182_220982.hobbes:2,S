Hi there, I found the answer to my thread from Svetoslav Slavtchev [1]
(unfortunately he didn't cc-ed me) in the list archives.
His patch solves my problem, any chance to see it included in the
official kernel?
BTW, if more infos on this issue are needed I can easily supply them,
eg:
this is a boot showing the problem:
  Apr 21 15:12:59 inferi kernel: serio: i8042 AUX0 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
  Apr 21 15:12:59 inferi kernel: serio: i8042 AUX1 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
  Apr 21 15:12:59 inferi kernel: serio: i8042 AUX2 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
  Apr 21 15:12:59 inferi kernel: serio: i8042 AUX3 port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
this doesn't:
  Apr 21 15:15:13 inferi kernel: serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
thanks
