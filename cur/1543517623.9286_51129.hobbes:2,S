hm, looks like we'll have to use cmpxchg8b.

yep, right. if you change the PAE clear_pte() to use cmpxchg8b, does it
fix the boot problems you see?

i think we should definitely update 64-bit ptes atomically, this could be
especially important for multiple threads mapping/unmapping areas and
building TLBs. This could also be a security risk. (just imagine half of
the pte being seen on one CPU and the TLB goes to the wrong place.)
i think we still have some other problem, but this is a definitive bug i
believe, yes.
