The menu "IP: Virtual Server Configuration" doesn't have a help text for
itself.  But the very first menu item in it (on which all other items
happen to depend on) has the following help text:
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/net/ipv4/ipvs/Kconfig?v=2.6.21#007
In Linux 2.6.22, the menu + the first menu item were fused into a
hybrid, a so-called menuconfig.  (Bad choice of term, but it wasn't
mine.  It's something different from the make menuconfig program.)
This fused menu+config item has exactly the same help text.
