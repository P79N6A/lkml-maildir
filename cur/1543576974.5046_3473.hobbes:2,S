Not true.
There's nothing unscalable in get_block() per se. The only lock we hold is
the per-page lock, which we must hold anyway. get_block() itself does not
need any real locking: you can do it with a simple per-inode spinlock if
you want to (and release the spinlock and try again if you need to fetch
non-cached data blocks).
Sure, the current ext2 _implementation_ sucks. Nobody has ever contested
that. 
Stop re-designing something just because you want to.
