That should work fine, since we never explicitly refer to the entry in
the sys_call_table in our call chain (our callchain goes 
hijacked_function 
   -> hook_before
   if call original syscall
   ->  original syscall (the entry that was in the sys_call_table when we
       hijacked it, not the currrent entry!)
   -> hook_after
Note that we don't support stacking of hooks right now - we never had
need to.
