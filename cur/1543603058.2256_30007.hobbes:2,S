I was thinking about this as well.  It should be relatively easy to allow
a line line "console=eth0,XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX,a.b.c.d" or similar.  The only
slight problem might be in configuring the interface early enough in the
boot process.  AFAIK (which isn't much in this area) the serial console
has special "console" code which allows it to be used very early in the
boot process.
You would obviously need to have the network driver compiled into the kernel
and not a module.  Maybe Ingo can hack something where it is possible
to initialize the network code very early in the boot process?
Cheers, Andreas
