Agreed, but we might be running into one of these.

Suppose somebody sends you a patch which implements a nice
algorithm that just happens to be patented by that same
somebody.  You don't know about the patent.
You integrate the patch into the kernel and distribute it,
one year later you get sued by the original contributor of
that patch because you distribute code that is patented by
that person.
Not having some protection in the license could open you
up to sneaky after-the-fact problems.
Having a license that explicitly states that people who
contribute and use Linux shouldn't sue you over it might
prevent some problems.

Rik
