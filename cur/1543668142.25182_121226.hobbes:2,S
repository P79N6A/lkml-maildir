I have an Asus P2L97-DS motherboard.  It has two PII-333 in it.  I'm
using the onboard SCSI interface, which is a 7880 (U).  I have 5-SCSI
drives (combination of wide and narrow), a SCSI CDROM and a SCSI tape
drive.  The drives have ID's 0-6 while the interface has ID 7.
When attempting to boot 2.5.65 or 2.5.64, neither is able to get past
SCSI initialization.  It simply loops and never completes a boot cycle. 
I have tried both the "newer" Adaptec AIC7xxx Fast -> U160 support (New
Driver) and the older Adaptec AIC7xxx support (old driver).  Both
experience the same behavior.
I'm currently running 2.4.19 and this system has been working, more or
less as is, since the mid 2.2-days.
Best Regards,
Greg Copeland
