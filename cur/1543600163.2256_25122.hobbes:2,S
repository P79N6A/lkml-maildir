this already exist in the current kernels, as long as you use video boards
that can be initialised independently
from the bios .
the 1st head can be whatever you want, but the next heads have to be
carefully chosen (matrox boards comes to mind)
then disable software scrollback as there are issues with multihead .

this is "con2fb":
to assign 2nd Virtual console to 2nd head :
con2fb /dev/fb1 /dev/tty2
