Mike, I'm not saying RSDL is perfect, but v0.31 is by far better than 
mainline.  Try this easy test:
startx with the vesa driver
run reflect from the mesa5.0-demos
load 5 cpu-hogs
start moving the mouse
On my desktop, mainline completely breaks down, and no nicing may rescue.
On RSDL, even without nicing, the desktop is at least useable.
What we need is constructive criticism to improve the situation, either with 
mainline or with RSDL.  And for now RSDL is better.
Thanks!
