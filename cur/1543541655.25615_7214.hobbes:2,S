Hi all, (please keep parted@gnu.org cc'd)
Linux doesn't attempt to keep master (eg /dev/hda) and partition (eg /dev/hda5)
devices consistent.  This is bad for Parted, because it does all IO through
the master device.  Eg, if you do:
(1) mount /dev/hda4
(2) reboot, without unmounting /dev/hda4
(3) e2fsck /dev/hda4
(4) read() /dev/hda, looking at the bit of /dev/hda where /dev/hda4 lies,
you still get the old (dirty) partition.
Doing BLKFLSBUF on /dev/hda and /dev/hda[0-9] seems to have help.  Are there
going to be other issues (eg: with the page cache)?
Note: Parted doesn't attempt to operate on mounted partitions.  (Although,
it does check what file system is on a partition, by looking for signatures)
Thanks,
Andrew Clausen
