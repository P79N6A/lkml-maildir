| Consider this scenario with what you're proposing:
| 
| 	thread				irq
| 
| 	take mutex
| 	get_mctrl
| 					cts changes state
| 					take port lock
| 					mctrl state read
| 					tty->hw_stopped changed state
| 					release port lock
| 	releaes mutex
| 	take port lock
| 	update tty->hw_stopped
| 	release port lock
| 
| Now, tty->hw_stopped does not reflect the hardware state, which will be
| buggy and can cause a loss of transmission.
|

 Neither do I. :((
 I thought we could move the 'tty->hw_stopped' update to a workqueue
but it has the same problem you explained above...
 Greg, any suggestions?
