The aim of the patch looks sensible, but it will not compile for
2.6.21-rc4.  8250_x86.c tests pnp_platform_devices, which does not
exist.  Also the combination of CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_X86=y and
CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_PNP=m would result in 8250_x86.o being built into
vmlinux but referring to serial8250_nopnp in module 8250_pnp.o, kernel
to module references are tricky.
