Huh?:
	dtlk.c - DoubleTalk PC driver for Linux
That doesn't look like the Comtrol Rocketport (drivers/char/rocket.c)
driver to me. : )
Meanwhile 2.4.19 Documentation/devices.txt shows:
 46 char        Comtrol Rocketport serial card
                  0 = /dev/ttyR0        First Rocketport port
                  1 = /dev/ttyR1        Second Rocketport port
                    ...
