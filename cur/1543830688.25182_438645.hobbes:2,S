#define EDQUOT      1133    /* Quota exceeded */
I noticed that the errno value for EDQUOT on MIPS is considerably larger
than all others.  This can lead to a situation where functions using
ERR_PTR() to return error codes in pointers cannot return this error
code without IS_ERR() thinking that the pointer is valid.  In my case,
it caused an alignment exception in the XFS open call when quota has
been exceeded in the linux-mips 2.6.14 kernel.  I think that the XFS
code has changed enough that this bug isn't in newer versions, though I
haven't done a thorough investigation.  
I've supplied a patch that addresses this situation by changing the
threshold used by IS_ERR if EMAXERRNO is defined and greater than 1000. 
Perhaps permanently raising the threshold value to something >1133 is
sufficient.
Looking forward to your feedback.
