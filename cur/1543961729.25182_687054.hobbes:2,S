Stas, Dmitry,
I agree with you... on a regular system, all the platform devices should
be enumerated, even if we don't use their drivers. It's only for use in
embedded devices (CONFIG_EMBEDDED) that we could omit this enumeration
to reduce kernel size.
Would you post a patch doing this?
Thank you,
:-)
Michael.
