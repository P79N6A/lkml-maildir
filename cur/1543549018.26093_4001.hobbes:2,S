The test2 elevator (assuming it is the same as the test8 version) in the
infinite latency case will always send the request with the lowest sector
number to the drive. (The request queue will always be sorted, since the
elevator function degenerates to insertion sort.) Do you really suggest
that this is as good as a real elevator algorithm?
