Andrew, 
It looks like it is a kernel bug triggered by NdisWrapper. Without 
NdisWrapper, and with just 8139too plus some light network activity the 
size-64 grew from ~ 1100 to 4500 overnight. Is this normal? I will keep it 
running to see where it goes.
A question - is it safe to assume it is  a kmalloc based leak? (I am thinking 
of tracking it down by using kprobes to insert a probe into __kmalloc and 
record the stack to see what is causing so many allocations.)
Thanks
Parag
