I was just messing around with putting a linux system on a single LS-120
(got KDE running off it) and what I did was dumb Stampede packages onto
/dev/hdd1 with tar xvpIf, so it didn't set up any of the config files or
anything like that. I also forgot to edit fstab, so it was all wrong. When
I went to boot (via loadlin), fsck gave me some errors and stuff, but it
got the root partition mounted read-write, even withought a valid fstab.
Yeah, it would certainly be nice to be able to depend on the LS-120 being
in a specific location, especially for using it on different systems, but
it's not necessary.
