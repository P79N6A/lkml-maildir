Hi,
  I'm a newcomer of this list.  I want to understand the tcp/ip stack's
implementaion, and hope that I can get your help.
  I find that that sk_buff can be fragmented, and it's called nonlinear.
What's the meaning of nonlinear?  And what are the meaning of sk_buff's
fields: skb->data_len and skb_shinfo(skb)?  I have no idea about them.
May you explain them?  Thank you.
