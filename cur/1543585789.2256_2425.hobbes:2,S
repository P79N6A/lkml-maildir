I'm preparing an updated version of the patch for 2.4.3-pre8.  I'll
incorporate this change.

I considered two workarounds:
1. Adding some cruft to the language to support this case, as you suggest.
I might have gone this route, until I tripped over the two bugs and
the bad config symbols in the CRIS port tree.  That meant there was
going to have to be a cleanup patch anyway, so why not fix those 20 
symbols (out of 1831) rather than grubbifying the language?
2. Hacking the CML2 lexical analyzer to handle this case.
I could have done this, allowing tokens to be recognized as numeric only
if all chars are digits.  I didn't, for two reasons: (1) Lexical analysis
is, as it turns out, a hotspot in the CML2 compiler code -- the last thing
it needs is more overhead, and (2) interpreting symbols with leading digits
as nonnumeric tokens is just *wrong*.  Ugh.  Violates the Principle of Least
Surprise big-time.
