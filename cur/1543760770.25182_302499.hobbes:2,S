I can't find any documentation about this, but it seems like the same
problem that has been causing me headaches lately; when I replace glibc
from the server side of an nfsroot, the client has a couple of
variously wrong reads before it sees the new files.  If it breaks NFS
so badly, why is it the default for the Linux NFS server?
