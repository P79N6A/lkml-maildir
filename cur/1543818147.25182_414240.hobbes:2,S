I haven't seem anyone comment on this, but it would be useful to see this
integrated.
If you have a bunch of Linux machines and two machines have the same
address allocated (not so impossible) they won't notice until they start
communicating with each other.
A third machine attempting to communicate with either party won't be able
to do so.  With this patch in place, overlapping assignments are noticed
much faster due to the broadcast.
Something else I've noticed while I've been implementing my zeroconf
daemon is that the kernel returns link-scoped primary addresses first to
'ifconfig'.  Unfortunately quite a lot of user-space programs parse its
output and interpret the address it presents as the primary for the
specified interface.
Is that a case of user-space breakage that the kernel team would
ordinarily worry about?
Thanks,
Anand
