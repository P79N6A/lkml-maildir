Yes, I also thought in that direction, since the main difference between
the processor module loaded or not seems to be the idle handler.

I seem to be unable to reproduce the problem on my home network. It is a
small (switched) 100BaseT network which is connected to the outside via an
asynchronous dsl line (128/768kbit). Maybe the different LAN topology or
the slow external link make the difference. I will retry on monday on the
corporate network. The latter is a large university net, with our section
consisting of 100BaseT-to-100BaseFX tranceiver switches. I do not have
information on the rest of the network.

I cannot say at this moment, since I cannot reproduce the problem at home
(see above). I will try to get some info on this matter on monday. Stay
tuned.

Will try to install a 2.4 kernel on the box and see what happens.
