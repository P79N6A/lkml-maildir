When I highlight text and go to paste it by pressing both buttons at the
same time it only works 10% of the time. The majority of the time it
fails (don't paste anything).
When it fails, if I immediately press just the left mouse button about
1/2 the time it will paste.
I don't know if this is recent or not as I just recently started using
2.6 full time and I haven't used all the revisions.
