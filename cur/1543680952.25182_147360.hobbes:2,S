Some nice testing you've done there. Yeah, the 'map vs reality' is
confusing when configuring. I previously changed the 8 to 32, following
the help, but for 2.5.75 changed it to 8 based on an offhand comment on
lkml saying: '8 has been tested as optimal'.
Hope LinuxTag isn't drawing all the developers attention away from your
problem!
