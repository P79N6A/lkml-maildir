We do a single copy/checksum from user space. You have to do the copy because
the packet may not be DMAable, may not be aligned for most PCI hardware and
numerous other things. Since that copy costs as much as the checksum its 
effectively free in the checksum computation. It also avoids considerable
complexity on the TCP paths when you need to retransmit.

OSPF is a matter of getting the graph theory right.
