GFS is different here mostly due to locking, because one of its strong 
features is an implementation of pretty strict POSIX semantics in a 
clustered environment, something that no other Linux FS (that is 
available in source code) has done so far. (OCFS2 does not do it as 
strictly - it has a very specific application in mind)
so i'd reformulate your request as a request to extend the VFS to unify 
clustering filesystems - which is a nice cleanup goal but not a merge 
showstopper to me.

yeah, the tty_ export is unnecessary and should be fixed. But this seems 
quite easy to do.
