Coprocessor 3D mode is deeply pipelined
2D mode is immediate
How can you build a system that process swaps between these two modes?
The 3D pipeline has to be emptied before you can enter 2D immediate
mode.
My solution is to leave the coprocessor always running and convert
everything to use the DMA based commands.
