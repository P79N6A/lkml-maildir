I've been pointed to the NX feature off-list and investigated, my CPU
(AMD Athlon XP 2500+ Model 10 "Barton") doesn't support the noexec flag,
and dmesg does not contain any output that MX was enabled, and the Java
"Killed" problem persists when the kernel is booted with noexec=off.
It must have entered the tree between v2.6.7 and revision 1.1757 in
Linus' tree.
BTW, how do I tell BitKeeper "pull up to revision..."?  bk pull and bk
undo -aREV is a way, but it's wasteful.
