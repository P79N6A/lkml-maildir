It can run at almost any time, just not in the interrupt context,
where it needs to schedule the tx softirq first.
Also, the number of tx interrupts you get is a tradeoff between
causing overhead of calling the interrupt handler and stalling
sockets that are waiting for space to become free after transmission.
By using ->poll for it, you can avoid tx interrupts completely
most of the time and free skbs immediately when data comes in.
