They should all work

No

The list in the help section for ide tcq is pretty much complete.
Genereally, IBM deskstar drives support tcq and that's about it.

Yes it will help any setup. Due to way ide tcq works, it's recommended
only to use tcq on one drive on a channel right now. This may change in
the future.
I don't have any general numbers. I did some benchmarking when I first
implemented it, and it typically shows (as with scsi drives) that having
just enough tags to keep the disk busy helps a bit. The linux io
scheduler does the rest. For random reads, 10-30% speed increase was
observed.

TCQ itself is described in the ata standards, but that's just a
technical description of how to use it from a driver. For general ide
tcq discussions, you probably want to search on google for instance.

You could, I should know a bit about it too though :-)
