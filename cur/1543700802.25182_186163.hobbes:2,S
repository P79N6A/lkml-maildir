Folks,
I have been working on a project called "Kernel Process Firewall (KPF)" 
that is nearing completion.  The goal of the project is to provide users 
the ability to trace, monitor and control the system calls made by any 
process.  I expect KPF to be of great value to system administrators, 
security analysts and researchers in general and solicit your comments. 
 Some of you may have seen version 0.1 of the RFC which I mailed out 
earlier this month, just before I started work on the project.  I have 
added more details in version 0.2, which is available from
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~raj/comminst/RFC
If any of you'd be interested in accessing the code, I'll make it available.
Thanks in advance,
Raj
