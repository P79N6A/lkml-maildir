1) do you actually disagree with victor ?
2) victor is not the only person who has expressed this opinion. the
   most prolific irix critic seems to be larry mcvoy, who certainly
   claims to know quite a bit about the internals.
this discussion has the hallmarks of turning into a personal
bash-fest, which is really pointless. what is *not* pointless is a
considered discussion about the merits of the IRIX "RT" approach over
possible approaches that Linux might take which are dissimilar to the
IRIX one. on the other hand, as Victor said, a large part of that
discussion ultimately comes down to a design style rather than hard
factual or logical reasoning.
