Well, I am now running a 2.6.22 (without cfs) and could now see it once 
(within a month...) that exactly the same message from konqueror was 
produced.
So I think its a general problem of konqueror that was hidden and 
somehow its triggered much more often with the cfs.
I just wonder why nobody else has this problem.

PS: I am currently building a 2.6.23.1...
