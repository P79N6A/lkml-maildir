In looking at the makefile history, it would appear that libkconfig.so has been 
deleted from the build.  It seems, however, that qconf has not gotten the message:
  make O=/usr/src/ver/makena/obj/  xconfig ARCH=i386
   HOSTCXX scripts/kconfig/qconf.o
   HOSTLD  scripts/kconfig/qconf
scripts/kconfig/qconf arch/i386/Kconfig
./scripts/kconfig/libkconfig.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or 
directory
make[2]: *** [xconfig] Error 1
make[1]: *** [xconfig] Error 2
make: *** [xconfig] Error 2
