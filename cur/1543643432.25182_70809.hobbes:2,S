I am assuming that a hard drive is a non-packet device. Let me make sure I'm
interpreting this correctly: older ( and some current ) drives may flush cache
on standby/sleep; current and future drives may not. In addition, older drives
may not support the flush cache command.

Not my intention.

Still testing locally. I also want to fix the code so that the flush is
done before the standby.

This wouldn't be a config option. You would have to modify ide.c by
hand to disable standby.
