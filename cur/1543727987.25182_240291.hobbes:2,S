Hello!
I'm getting reproducable errors when Samba is transferring
large files:
eth0: Transmit timed out, status 0000, PHY status 786d, resetting...
This is not the case if such a file is transferred using FTP.
And yes, im running with "pci=noacpi,usepirqmask,biosirq noapic"
(otherwise the problem happens so frequently that eth0 is more
or less unusable).
I know that the Via-Rhine hardware and/or the driver isn't
perfect, but b/c i'm having a reproducable testcase here, i
thought i might be able to assist in fixing this problem (if
it is fixable at all, of course). In addition, as this
machine is mainly a Samba fileserver it's getting pretty
annoying.
I'm using an Epox EP-8HDA3+ Athlon64 Motherboard with
VIA K8T800 chipset. The board has two on-board ethernet
devices, the VIA Rhine 100BaseT and an 3Com/Marvell 1000BaseT
chip. Both are sharing it's interrupts with each other and
on-board USB devices (however i'm neither using the Marvell
nor any USB peripherals):
