I do agree, I've used "kill -9 -1" myself.
However, let's see how problematic it is to try to follow it (in 2.5.x,
not 2.4.x) and if people really complain.
Count one for the complaints, but I want more to overrule a published
standard.
(Of course, a language lawyer will call "self" a "system process",
although I cannot for the life of me really see what kind of excuse we
would come up with to do se ;)
