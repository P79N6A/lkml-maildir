Keeping a lid on the amount of space wasted by unused
table entries is one factor; it's an implementation
tradeoff.  In normal usage the number of IRQs (or GPIOs)
is defined by the board (or system) design, and there's
no real point to allowing more.
That said, NR_IRQS is kind of inflexible.  It's not easy
to provide board-specific overrides for cases like having
a few FPGAs or other external IRQ (or GPIO!) controllers
which chain IRQs and plug into those tables...
Both could use a way to extend a platform-defined minimum
to support a configurable number of external controllers.
Lacking that, both have somewhat ad-hoc solutions to make
sure board variants can be set up with the same kernel.
It basically boils down to making sure there are some extra
entries at end-of-table, and policies to allocate them.
