I was wrong... the interfering effect is here also with nicksched.
The problem is that Linux is smarter than me --> sometimes I forget the
effect of the disk-cache ;)
For the DD test I always umount/(re)mount the partition where the
BIGFILE is stored to discard the associated cache... but I've forgotten
to do the same for the file that transcode is reading from ;)
