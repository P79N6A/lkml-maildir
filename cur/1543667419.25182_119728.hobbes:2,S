Yes, sorry, ambiguous.
I meant "I suspect most people agree with Alan"
I do not presume to know what most people think.  I presume to think I
know, hence "I suspect ..."
Anyhow, all I am saying is, if people _require_ support or bug fixes or
instant updates they should use a vendor kernel.  This does not mean we
should not facilitate users who do make their own kernel.
This thread is getting off-topic...
