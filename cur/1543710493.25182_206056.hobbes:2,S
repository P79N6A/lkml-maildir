I've also applied this and it works for me.
But do we really even need this anymore?  The only reason the name was
even semi-important was that we were actually putting the kobject into
sysfs.  Now that we are not doing that, it isn't needed.  In fact I am
now running with a simple:
	#define cdev_set_name(cdev, args...)
in cdev.h to verify this.
Anyone object to me just deleting cdev_set_name() and everywhere it is
now used entirely?
thanks,
