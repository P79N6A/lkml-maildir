Hi, n.
This was fixed a couple of weeks back, but the patch seems to have
encountered some especially slow electrons.  Please use the driver from
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/#3c59x-2.3
 and let me know how it
works out.
I'll resubmit this in a few days - I'm still awaiting some more test
results from the addition of support for the problematic 3c566B mini-PCI
NIC.
