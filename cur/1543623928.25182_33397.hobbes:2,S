Could you please tell me which was the last version (possible up to
pre status) which worked? And could you possible tell where the
system actually hangs during the boot process (what is the
last init message which appears on the screen?).
During IDE setup? During mounting? During fsck or whatever.
I'm asking this becouse I couldn't get patch-2.5.6-pre3 working
on my athlon system and there are as well apparent instabilities
on my i440MX based notebook, which are not related to the IDE changes.
(pre2 with patch number 16 and 17 applied works for me of course on
both of them quite well...)
Thank you in advance.
