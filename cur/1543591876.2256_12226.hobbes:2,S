     *some* developers prefer it.  Not all.

Can you define what you mean here?  It's not really clear to me, and I
suspect others.

I don't think he is introducing new modes, he's just trying to make
sure that you can't create a .config which is broken.  Part of my
complaint early on was that it would just barf on a config it thought
wasn't legall, and just drop me to the 'vi' level.  I don't think this
is acceptable because you (CML2 or CMLxxxx) should be able to prompt
the user for a suggested fix.  
David> CONFIG_AUNT_TILLIE does not require CML2.
Correct.
David> CML2 does not require CONFIG_AUNT_TILLIE.
Correct.  And never has offered it either!
David> Let's not talk about CONFIG_AUNT_TILLIE any more, or change the

I think it comes down to people who just want one or more of:
- the existing interface of vi .config; make oldconfig
- fear that CML2 won't let them make crazy configurations, such as an
  8-way SMP box with ISA.  Can't see how CML2 would restrict this
  choice myself.
- Don't want to install python 2.x for a kernel upgrade.
- fear that some configuration corner case will be handled wrong for a
  strange (read not common) system config.  
All that CML2 does is enforce dependencies in the configuration
language.  You can't make a .config which conflicts.  Admittedly
there's nothing stopping you from hacking it with vi after the fact,
but why?
If you run into a case where you have a config which would work, but
CML2 doesn't let you, why don't you fix the grammar instead of saying
CML2 is wrong?  Let's not confuse these two issues as well.
