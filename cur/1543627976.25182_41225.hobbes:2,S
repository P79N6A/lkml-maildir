No trouble at all.

It does keep the original philosophy, and it's not too complicated:
	(1) Keeping the bound migration_thread in busywait prevents
		the idle task from not being able to migrate an unbound
		task from a cpu where task is bound already because the
		task it wants to migrate is already running -- basically
		the state of busywait locks the cpu
	(2) Putting migration_init() to sleep on a completion to free
		up the cpu it's running on and waking it up when every
		migration_thread has made it home to opens up the cpu
		migration_init() was running on quite safely, and that
		that progress is tracked by an atomic counter
	(3) Getting rid of the timeouts, they lead to livelocks (or
		very long waits) when the window while something's
		awake is always when it can't get anything done
It's really a very conservative algorithm.

I'm not sure set_cpus_allowed() is safe to call at this stage. OTOH
setting task->cpus_allowed one way or the other from the argument will
ensure that the only idle task to steal it is the one from the cpu it's
destined for. Basically, it's whether you pick your cpu before or after
you land on it. The idle task will bring you home either way. An extra
push from cpu0 probably doesn't hurt either. =)
The only bit that really scares me is that I know my own patch works
and I don't really truly know that yours does (and never will until I
run it a number of times). And I'll bet you're in a similar position
yourself. The side issues are non-issues to me; I just want kernels that
do a little more than hang at boot so I can hack on other parts of it.
I'll get around to testing it soon, but it's kind of a pain, because
failed attempts didn't fail every time, and the machines where it fails
are not swift to boot... though I imagine you're in a similar position
wrt. testing being a hassle. =)
Let me get some other things out of the way and I'll make time for it.
Though we may have duplicated effort, I do appreciate your work.
Thanks,
Bill
