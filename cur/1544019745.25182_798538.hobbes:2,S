I don't see the error in your tip tree, but I saw the following earlier this week when
compiling in the linux-next tree:
	arch/x86/include/asm/uv/uv.h:16: warning: struct mm_struct declared inside parameter list
	include/asm/uv/uv.h:16: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration,
						which is probably not what you want
Unfortunately my log does not capture the file that produced this error.
I believe it was from a non-UV file that indirectly included uv.h. It is
possible that subsequent changes have removed the indirect reference.

Agree & I plan to do that. I need to add a arch/ia64/include/asm/uv/uv.h
file and hide the uglyness there. IA64 does not used the same method
of determining the platform type. IA64 historically uses:
	ia64_platform_is("uv")
The GRU driver must be supported on both IA64 & x86. I've tried to hide the
platform differences but some are difficult (especially regarding irqs &
vectors).
