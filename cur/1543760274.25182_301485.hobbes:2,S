This is used in two files, but never declared extern in the second file
(iSeries_setup.c). Should it go in a header file as a static inline
instead?
There also seems to be a local static is_kernel_text() in kallsyms that
overlaps (but it's not identical). Removing that redundancy can be taken
care of as a janitorial patch outside of the noexec stuff.
