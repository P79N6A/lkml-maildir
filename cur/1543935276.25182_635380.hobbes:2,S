Yup.  Your name comes out like that when sylpheed does its
save-email-to-a-file thing as well and I haven't got around to working out
why, or to reporting it.
In this case it looks like the dud characters came about due to "[MTD] Fix
legacy character sets throughout drivers/mtd, include/linux/mtd".  Which
doesn't look like it fixed anything much really.
Going with the asciified/anglicised/bastardised spelling is a practical
(albeit unhappy) solution.
