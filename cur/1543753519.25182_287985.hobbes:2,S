Hi Andrew,
I was playing with kexec+kdump and ran into this on 2.6.10-mm1.
I have seen similar behaviour on 2.6.10. 
I am using a 4-way P-III machine. I have a module which tries
gets same spinlock twice. When I try to "insmod" this module,
my system hangs. All my windows froze, no more new logins,
console froze, doesn't respond to sysrq. I wasn't expecting
a system hang. Why ? Ideas ?
Here is the code.
Thanks,
Badari
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <asm/uaccess.h>
#include <linux/spinlock.h>
spinlock_t mylock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;
static int __init panic_init(void)
{
        spin_lock_irq(&mylock);
        spin_lock_irq(&mylock);
       return 1;
}
 
 
module_init(panic_init);
