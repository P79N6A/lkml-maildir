I've looked at the -mm version of mm/memory.c today, with intend to 
try out VM_PFNMAP for our xip mappings and replace nopage() with fault().
The thing is, I believe it does'nt work for us:
  * The way we recognize those mappings is through the rules set up
  * by "remap_pfn_range()": the vma will have the VM_PFNMAP bit set,
  * and the vm_pgoff will point to the first PFN mapped: thus every
  * page that is a raw mapping will always honor the rule
  *
  *      pfn_of_page == vma->vm_pgoff + ((addr - vma->vm_start) >> 
PAGE_SHIFT)
This is, as far as I can tell, not true for our xip mappings. Ext2 may 
spread the physical pages behind a given file all over its media. That 
means, that the pfns of the pages that form a vma may be more or less 
random rather than contiguous. The common memory management code 
cannot tell whether or not a given page has been COW'ed.
Did I miss something?
so long,
Carsten
