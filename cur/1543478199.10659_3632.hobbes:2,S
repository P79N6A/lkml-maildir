| The Single Unix Specification says:
| 
| : The vfork() function has the same effect as fork(),
| : except that the behaviour is undefined if the process
| : created by vfork() either modifies any data other than
| : a variable of type pid_t used to store the return value
| : from vfork(), or returns from the function in which
| : vfork() was called, or calls any other function before
| : successfully calling _exit() or one of the exec family
| : of functions. 
| 
| So this one is (if I interpret it correctly)
| definitly bad code.

Yes.  Return in the child -> the parent's stack pointer is now left pointing 
to unknown data, because the stack is shared but the stack pointers 
(obviously) aren't.  (Unless #define vfork fork.)
vfork() is a horrible kludge.  This is why.

     We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
