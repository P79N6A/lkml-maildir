Step one is ship both in -mm. If that doesn't give us enough
confidence, ship both in mainline. If that doesn't give us enough
confidence, wait until vendors ship both. Eventually a clear picture
should emerge. If it doesn't, either the change is not significant or
no one cares.
But it really is important to be able to do controlled experiments on
this stuff with little effort. That's the recipe for getting lots of
valid feedback.
