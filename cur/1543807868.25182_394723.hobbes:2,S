I'm not sure if the problem is real.  If it turns out to be, it'll be solvable
in a couple of sane ways, so I don't think we need to worry about it
in advance.
I'd like the userland suspend to be an option and not a drop-in replacement
of swsusp or suspend2, so IMO it can be started in a different way.
Greetings,
Rafael
