How about typedef'ing  structs?
I'm not to clear on what "sparse" can do; however, in the good old days,
gcc allowed you to commit great sins when passing "struct blah *" to 
subroutines, whereas it stoped you cold if you tried the same trick 
with a typedef'ed "blah_t *".  This got me into the habit of turning
all structs into typedefs in my personal projects.  Can we expect
something similar for the kernel, and in particular, should we start
typedefing structs now?
(Documentation/CodingStyle doesn't mention typedef at all).
