I agree that UML won't be able to show the performance advantages (the
fact that the UML kernel can't control the cache footprint on the CPU's
becouse it gets swapped from one to another at the host OS's convienience
is just one issue here)
however with UML you should be able to develop the tools and features to
start to weld the two different kernels into a single logical image. once
people have a handle on how these tools work you can then try them on some
hardware that has a lower level partitioning setup (i.e. the IBM
mainframes) and do real speed comparisons between one kernel that's given
X CPU's and Y memory and two kernels that are each given X/2 CPU's and Y/2
memory.
the fact that common hardware doesn't nicly support the partitioning
shouldn't stop people from solving the other problems.
