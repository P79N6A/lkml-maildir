[SNIPPED strange program]
The program allocates memory. It does this by either setting the break
address or mapping memory. It depends upon the malloc() that your
'C' runtime library uses.
The usual malloc() never resets the break address or remaps memory
because it is an expensive operation. This means that when new
data space needs to be allocated, malloc() doesn't have to get
anything from the kernel because it already has, probably, all
that it needs.
The only way memory will be 'returned' is when your program
calls exit() or otherwise ceases to exist.
FYI, this isn't a kernel issue. Even if it was broken it's
not a kernel issue because the kernel doesn't care what a
user-mode program does with the address-space it has allocated.
It's address-space that it hasn't allocated that it cares
about. That gives you a seg-fault.
