Yes, it's about the choice of the overhead/generalization that
indirections bring about.

The facility is already there: it is called dcache.

The seek storm is mostly caused by small files(that are read in wholes),
and the corresponding scattered dir/inode buffers. By moving these
files to one single directory, both the file data/inode buffers are
kept continuous enough.

The linux cache model is something like:
                     physical drive             file /dev/hda1

As opposed to this one:
                      file /dev/hda1         physical drive
