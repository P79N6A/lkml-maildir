What has changed is only the steps needed.
Old way:
make anakin_config	=> copied def-configs/ankin to .config
make oldconfig		=> required to make a consistent config
New way
make anakin_defconfig	=> Creates a consistent config in one step
The patch just introduced a generic method to fetch a given
configuration and to make that configuration consistent.
Similar to running "make oldconfig".
See, no new funtionality, just a different way to achieve the same.
OK?

As outlined in a private mail, the only thing needed for arm to do
is to rename 48 files and one directory. And to delete ~10 lines form a
makefile.
That is an acceptable price to pay for getting generic support for something
that will see wider use by other architectures (my prediction).
