Enabling CONFIG_PARPORT_PC_FIFO has not helped, I now
get the following:
# modprobe parport_pc verbose_probing=1 irq=auto
Winbond Super-IO detection, now testing ports 3F0,370,250,4E,2E ...
SMSC Super-IO detection, now testing Ports 2F0, 370 ...
parport0: PC-style at 0x378<7>0x378: FIFO is 16 bytes
0x378: writeIntrThreshold is 16
0x378: readIntrThreshold is 16
0x378: PWord is 8 bits
0x378: Interrupts are ISA-Pulses
0x378: ECP port cfgA=0x10 cfgB=0x40
0x378: ECP settings irq=<none or set by other means> dma=<none or set by other means>
 [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(98)
parport0: faking semi-colon
parport0: Printer, Hewlett-Packard HP LaserJet 1100
modprobe verbose_probing=1 irq=7 gives exactly the same results.

But with 2.4.10 it _was_ using ECP mode and I was
having no trouble...
