I think I fixed a set_rtc_mss/RTC SMP race that can easily trigger using
the RTC interrupt in SMP. (see the rtc.c comment changes for explanation)
patch against 2.2.15pre13:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.15pre13/set_rtc_mss-SMP-race-1.gz
It involves changes to all the architectures that wants to provide the
RTC device, they now have to alloc and export to modules the rtc_lock
spinlock in the architectural part. It also make the rtc device a bit more
SMP friendly.
