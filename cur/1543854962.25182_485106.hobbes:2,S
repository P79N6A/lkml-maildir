two cases
1. the IO port is not allocated by firmware, but
pci_assign_unassigned_resources will get that allocated.
2. the IO port is allocated by firmware, the bar will be retrieved by
pcibios_resource_survey.
so acctully the device already get the bar allocated in any case.
So what the purpose of this patch? the /poc/ioports hide ioport for the driver?
It seems need to add some pci_quirk to clear the bar for 2, and skip
the resource allocation for 1.
