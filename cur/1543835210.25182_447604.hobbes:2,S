For a C program it's just open()+fscanf()+close(). You can easily wrap
it up in a 10-line function, and that's probably what HAL and friends
are already doing.
Anyway, I was just pointing out a practical advantage. The decision
about sysfs's textual interface has already been taken, for better or
worse, and I don't think it's good to invent a totally new interface
unless there's a strong technical reason why the sysfs model is
inappropriate for this task.
