Yep.
The oops fix was just for a driver, but who knows how much testing that
patch has received?
2.4.16 looks like it will be what 2.4.15 was intended to be.
Hopefully, future kernels that are under Marcello's control won't have the
need to release becasue the last releas was broken.
This may have been one of the smallest changes between the last -pre and
-final.
Let's hope $(test -z "`diff -u last-pre -final`") returns true for future
2.4 kernels.
