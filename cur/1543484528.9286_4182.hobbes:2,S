nscd is the daemon which caches (as of now) passwd, group, and hosts
lookups (as defined in /etc/nsswitch.conf). It's multithreaded and way
cool, mainly because it (and the linuxthreads library) went through ~four
iterations of bugfixes until it finally worked without deadlocking under
load. ;-)
Glibc 2.1 talks to it using a Unix-domain socket and falls back to
interpret nsswitch.conf directly if that doesn't work.
The easy fix for this mess is "don't even try to build Unix sockets as a
module". What for? You'll need it anyway, and it's a mere 9 kbytes.
If you really need that kind of space, build a stripped glibc -- the heap
of wide character functions which nobody needs(*) can be stripped off, for
instance. Note, however, that glibc's build process doesn't support this
out of the box...
(*) meaning, on an install/rescue floppy.
