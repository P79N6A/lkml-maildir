There is not just the cifs md5 one (which has been around a long
time), but an md5_init (static) in crypto and the new one in rt.  The
addition of the new one (rt md5_init) causes the build problem.   It
would be nice if we could use the same md5 routines though ... last
time we checked the crypto one was not well suited for calculating
signatures as a network fs would do though.
