OK, but would it have any active semantics on non-Hurd kernels?  How
would the behaviour of ext3 change in the presence of a gnu.author
attribute on a file?
It would certainly be possible to add a generic ext2/3 namespace handler
to allow those fields to be set on, say, Linux hosts; but that would
just be a matter of matching the gnu.* syscall xattr encoding to the
EXT2_XATTR_INDEX_GNU on-disk encoding; it wouldn't actually deal with
any semantic expectations surrounding the use of those fields.
