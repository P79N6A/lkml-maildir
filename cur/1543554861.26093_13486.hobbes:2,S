That is obvious. I may be of course wrong, but I would consider this a 
drive problem, considering that another ide drive on the same controller 
works fine with DMA enabled (a QUANTUM TRB850A) while the Conner 
Peripherals 1275MB - CFS1275A fails with DMA enabled. They are in fact both 
attached simultaneously  to the PIIX controller (on different IDE channels, 
both being masters) and one works and the other doesn't... - I should 
probably have stated that when posting but I didn't consider it important 
at the time (and copying by hand from one screen to another doesn't 
encourage copying everything but the essentials...). - Am I missing something?
Regards,
Anton
