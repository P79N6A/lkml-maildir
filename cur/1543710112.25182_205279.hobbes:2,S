Ah!  I did indeed misunderstand.
Yes, it would be good to end the cycle of re-implementing 802.11 over 
and over again ;-)
So here is my suggested plan:
* I merge prism54 upstream
* I create wireless-2.6 queue
* somebody (you, Jouni(sp?)) submits HostAP to me
* I merge HostAP
* submit rtnetlink patches to me
* start working on generic 802.11 stack in wireless-2.6 queue
* at the same time, migrate away from iw_handler to "wireless_ops" (i.e. 
something like ethtool_ops)
* once things have stabilized again, merge upstream
I'm not sure about the order of the last few steps, you know better than 
I what dependencies exist.
