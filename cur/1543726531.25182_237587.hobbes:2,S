I do agree with the patch, but I have two worries:
1) Changing from GFP_ATOMIC to <something else> may break code
2) Conversely from #1, I also worry why GFP_ATOMIC would be needed at 
all.  I code all my drivers to require that pci_alloc_consistent() be 
called from somewhere that is allowed to sleep.
