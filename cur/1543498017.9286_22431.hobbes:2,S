Unfortunately I can't see how handle_IRQ_event ever directly called 
__get_free_pages. So I don't think the IRQ part of the trace is valid.
The rest however is rather obvious 8) _iff_ you are using rt signals.
kernel/signal.c: send_sig_info uses GFP_KERNEL from a bh.
Change
	        struct signal_queue *q = 0;
		     if (nr_queued_signals < max_queued_signals) {
	        	q = (struct signal_queue *)
                            kmem_cache_alloc(signal_queue_cachep, GFP_KERNEL);
                }
to use GFP_ATOMIC instead and let me know
