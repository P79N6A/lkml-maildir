Marc, please choose a more appropriate list next time.  LKML is not  
for user questions about "Why doesn't my monitor+GPU work?"

Uhh, no;  1680x1050 does not require a dual-link DVI port/cable.  As  
to a good GPU which "Just Works(TM)" out of the box and still has at  
least passable render performance (although not for some modern  
games),  the R200-series Radeon cards (listed below) work extremely  
well.  They even support a 3d-accelerated merged-framebuffer Xinerama- 
style; you can split a 3d-accelerated window across both monitors.
R200-series cards:
   R200:  Radeon 8500/8500LE/9100, FireGL 8700/8800
   rv250: Radeon 9000/9000Pro
   rv280: Radeon 9200/9250/9200SE
