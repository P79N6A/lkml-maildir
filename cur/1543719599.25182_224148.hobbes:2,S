Hi!
The CRIS architecture is very much alive and locally we are running 2.6.6.
It is true that I haven't submitted any patches since 2.5.74 or 
something like that. It is my intention to send in a patch asap,
hopefully this week.
I will submit 2.6 patches more often in the future. Later this year 
we will also add support for a new CRIS subarchitecture.

When grepping the source and even doing cross architecture changes it is
nice to have a ratehr up-to-date version in the main stream kernel.
It would be nice if Axis could at least drop an update of the tree for
each kernel release (provided there are any changes).
This would allow all of us to get a better overview, and in some cases
we may even introduce new stuff / fix errors.
So please start to feed Andrew (or Linus) regularly with updates.
