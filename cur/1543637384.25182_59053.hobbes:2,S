Especially since the IDE code at the moment is not really something I
would trust uncoditionally a bit more comentary would be adequate IMHO,
even if it's just a: "Fixed race introduced in IDE-97, see flamewar"...
Perhaps not everyone wanting to use 2.5.x for some development is 
eager to disassemble a patch to see whether it might be usable or
trash the partition even more badly (given that one has the knowledge
to judge for her-/himself).
