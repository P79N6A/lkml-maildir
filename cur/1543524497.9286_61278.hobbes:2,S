 First off, you probably want to try linux-fs@.
 As to your question, I seem to remember someone writing something
that would add/delete _blocks_ to/from _the end_ of an ext2/raid0[1]
fs.
 Obviously the marked points are the important ones. Ie. If you have
been using a drive and want to "resize" it downwards[2], then you had
to move all of your data to the begining of the disks and then remove
any completely free blocks from the end.
 In short your best bet is still probably:
 1. Buy offline storage.
 2. tar -c
 3. fdisk/cfdisk
 4. tar -x
 I'd be happy to be proved wrong though.
[1] The raid0 comprising of ext2 fses.
[2] There's got to be a better way of expressing that, but I hope you
get the idea (that the fs should get smaller).
