Be very careful not to change the link order. You'll notice 2.3.x sound
recently changed a little explicitly because of this. if you re-order
the object files (eg sorting them) then you change the init order, and you
end up initialising boards in the wrong order, causing AHA1542 to grab
buslogic cards etc
