    Could be some oddity with the compiler and library...The only reason I
noticed the problem was because I decided to set the cdrom and zip drivers
as modules. However, doing an mrproper clean of the source tree and full
rebuild hasn't solved the problems. Now all modules fail to load (I've
retained the precompiled object files and a working kernel as a backup).
I've rebuilt the modutils package against the new library/compiler and the
problem still occurs. When I do ldd against the binaries everything
appears fine. genksyms appears on examination to be perfectly OK.
   I had previously built the kernel against egcs and glibc-2.1.1 without
problems. This included a build from a fresh source tree with the original
configuration.
   This is odd as I have CONFIG_MODULES CONFIG_MODVERSIONS and CONFIG_KMOD
set to 'y'... 
   However, it is still possible to insert the originall module objects
into the new kernel.
   Thanks,
   Matt
