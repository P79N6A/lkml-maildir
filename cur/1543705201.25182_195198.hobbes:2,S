Hello all,
I had experienced a lockups on three of my servers with 2.6.1. It doesn't
look like a deadlock, the box is still pingable and all tcp ports which were
 in listen state before a lockup are remains in listen state, but I can't get
any data from this ports. According to sar(1) systems had not been overloaded
right before a lockup. And there is no log entries in all user services logs
for almost 10 hours after lockup.
So I think this is an IO lockup. On the other side it doesn't look like a bug
 in particular controller driver, because they are different for each box.
And finally it doesn't look like a bug in particular io-scheduler because two
of boxes were runed with "deadline" and one with "as". Of course all
assumptions are valid only if all lockups I had seen have the same nature.
All of three boxes are SMP. Unfortunately all are remote and aren't attached
to a serial console yet (this is planed in next couple of weeks).
