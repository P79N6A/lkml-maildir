Yes.  And if the fuse process is not ready, what will sys_sync() do?
(As a side note, sys_sync() actually does nothing in fuse, so these
examples are slightly silly, but the concept applies to any filesystem
operation).

Since I don't know why sync() needs to be called from hibernate, I
can't argue about this.  But for _suspend_ it definitely should not be
needed.

Why exactly?  That's like saying the pipe must be able to deal with
writes until every task is frozen.
As I've said, fuse is just special kind of IPC.  The task calling into
fuse can assume nothing about when it's request will be served.  Just
like a task writing into a pipe can assume nothing about when that
write will return.
