But to work without breaking userspace it would need to be a character
that would pass through any path checking routines, ie be a legal path
character.

My personal implementation idea was to store lots of files for the form
file:revision_number (I'll keep using that until somebody sugests
something better) on the file system itself, with a hard link form the
latest version to file (this is probably not a major imporvement and
having the hard link coudl make it hard to implement deltas). This could
mean no changes to the file system itself (except maybe a flag to say
its versioned). The kernel would then do the translation to find the
correct file, and would only show the latest version to userapps not
requesting a specific version.

The whole interface would be designed to give existing behavior as
default for two reasons: users are used to opening a file and getting
the latest version and not to break userspace. I personally wouldn't
touch this either if it broke userspace. The only userspace change would
be the addition of tools to manage the revisions etc. Userspace could
later upgrade to take advantage of the new functionality but I cannot
see the worth in breaking it.
