Hi all.
Today i'm needing to use that (old) thing called EQL.
After follow a (broken) link at Configure.help, i've found in
Documentation/networking/eql.txt the ftp site for eql tools (domain that
don't exist anymore), but grab that '95 year eql-1.2.tar.gz file from
metalab and try to compile it in 2.2.13. Didn't work, as i expected.
Anyone's here still use this thing?
The system about to gain this "feature" will be a RH6.
Alan, i saw your name (again) in the eql_enslave.c. Do you have any
other version "stored on the hat" that works?
Thanks.
