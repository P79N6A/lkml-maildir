ok, MTRR setting overhead. It is not quite clear to me which precise
code took so much time, could you stick a couple of 'mcount();' lines
into arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/generic.c's prepare_set() and
generic_set_mtrr() functions? In particular the wbinvd() [cache
invalidation] instructions within prepare_set() look like a possible
source of latency.
(explicit calls to mcount() can be used to break up latency paths
manually - they wont affect the latency itself, they make the resulting
trace more finegrained.)
