Based on subsequent comments, I think you got that backwards - absense
of CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2 makes RAID detection fail, but no matter..

In the failure case, the SCSI drives (sdb, sdc) on which your raid
resides are not getting detected until after md initialisation has
decided that there is nothing to assemble.
My first thought was that the new threaded device discovery was
allowing md init to happen before scsi discovery was complete.  Maybe
the presence of CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2 makes some bit go faster...
However 
  # CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC is not set
so maybe not...
Greg (or anyone else reading): you know about this threaded
discovery.. could it allow some discovery to complete after userspace
has started, and does CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC affect it?
I think you best bet is to not depend on raid-auto-detect but to run
mdadm to assemble your arrays instead.  As your root isn't on md/raid,
that should be trivial to arrange.
