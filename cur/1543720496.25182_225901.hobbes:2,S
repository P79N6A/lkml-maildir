__builtin_memcpy() is definitely smart enough for that: e.g. on x86 (and you
don't get much more register-starved than that)
void b(char *);
void a(char *x, int count)
{
        char buf[8];
        int i;
        b(buf);
        for (i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                __builtin_memcpy(x, buf, 8);
                x += 8;
        }
}
will result (with -O2, which is normal for kernel) in
.L6:
        movl    %ecx, (%ebx)
        movl    %edx, 4(%ebx)
        addl    $8, %ebx
        decl    %eax
        jne     .L6
as the main loop, which gives you what you would get from use of u64.
And yes, constant-sized memcpy() in the kernel will be expanded to
__builtin_memcpy().
