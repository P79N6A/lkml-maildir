I only recently found out about that ... but in some cases I still
want to do something like this as I want to make a small tweak from
some of the standard config files (e.g. delete CONFIG_SMP to do a UP
build based on some of the standard configs).

Uh, no.  I guess that would have helped me figure out what was happening.

Ugh.

Presumably more follow-on from not defining any of the PAGE_SIZE
configs.

More ugh.

Apparently we do.

  ...

Agreed.

It is in include/linux/sched.h

Will fix ... while I'm trying to unravel all the rest of this.
Thanks for all the pointers.
