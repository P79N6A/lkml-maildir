As I understand it, when his upcoming changes are merged, base Reiser4
would no longer depend on ZLIB_INFLATE/DEFLATE and my patch would then be
incorrect. I am not in a position to know whether a code-dump or a minimal
fix or something in-between is most appropriate for the next -mm release,
for the moment just tweaking the Kconfig is working for me (I'm using
Reiser4 under 2.6.12-mm1 with no further problems).
HTH,
Andrew
