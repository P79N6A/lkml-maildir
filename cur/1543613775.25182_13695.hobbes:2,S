On ia32, change the value of __PAGE_OFFSET (where kernel space starts)
in include/asm-i386/page.h.  The size of kernel space must be a power
of 2, so you can change __PAGE_OFFSET from its default of 0xC0000000
to either 0xE0000000 (reasonable) or 0xF0000000 (overboard ?).
You must also change the unlabeled value near the top of
arch/i386/vmlinux.lds to match the value of __PAGE_OFFSET.

No changes are required in the method of compiling the kernel.  As for
your application, no changes should be required, although I am not
familiar with libhoard.  
Note that this change increases the mmap() region of user space, but
since you are speak of using malloc() and/or libhoard, that should be
sufficient for your purposes.  With __PAGE_OFFSET set to 0xE0000000,
your program should have (3.5GB - 2 * Program Size - Stack Size) of
usable address space.
Cheers, Wayne
