Hello All,
o I have written the following program to convert a core file to a
executable, and tried to execute the converted executable but my
system __HANGED__, The kernel did'nt give any messages the complete
system was stuck.
o Theoretically , the OS loader should jump into the virtual address
specified at 'ELF_HDR.e_entry and start executing instructions from
that point if the ELF_TYPE is ET_EXEC.
o So I wrote a program which
changes ELF_TYPE form ET_CORE to ET_EXEC and modifies e_entry to
virtual address of the 'main' symbol, since the core file has valid offset
to access the PHDRS, and for ET_EXEC the elf loader just need to map
the PHDRS at the vaddr specified and start jump to e_entry.
o Is there anything I'am missing, can some experts throw light on why
kernel does not load this program, could it be a bug in the kernel code ?
o The following is the program which converts core file to executable,
its simple to use just compile it with 'gcc convertcore.c -o
convertcore' , run with 'convertcore <core-file-name> <new-exec-name>
<vaddr-of-main>'
o I dump the core by CRTL+\
really appreciate your inputs
