touch_nmi_watchdog() is only "protection" against local interrupt
disablement triggering the NMI oopser because alert_counter[]
increments are not atomic. Yet even supposing they were made so, the
net effect of "covering up" this gross deficiency is making the
user-observable problems it causes undiagnosable, as noted before.

Kevin Marin was the first to report this issue to lkml. I had seen
instances of it in internal corporate bugreports and it was one of
the motivators for the work I did on pidhashing (one of the causes
of the timeouts was worst cases in pid allocation). Manfred Spraul
and myself wrote patches attempting to reduce read-side hold time
in /proc/ algorithms, Ingo Molnar wrote patches to hierarchically
subdivide the /proc/ iterations, and Dipankar Sarma and Maneesh
Soni wrote patches to carry out the long iterations in /proc/ locklessly.
The last several of these affecting /proc/ have not gained acceptance,
though the work has not been halted in any sense, as this problem
recurs quite regularly. A considerable amount of sustained effort has
gone toward mitigating and resolving rwlock starvation.
Aggravating the rwlock starvation destabilizes, not pessimizes,
and performance is secondary to stability.
