Hi,
<<I am not subscribed to this list b'cos of the volume of emails. Please
include my email in the reply.>>
I am writing a device driver for a fpga device. 
I implemented a dummy char device to gain user space access to the device
registers thru mmap. 
The kernel is 2.4.18. 
The CPU is sibyte (mips64 cpu) with 40 bits of physical addressing and 44
bits of virtual addressing.
After mmaping in userspace any writes to the mmap region is not working. 
I think it is b'cos of the protection field in the vma is set to
VM_DENYWRITE. 
The complete prot flag is (VM_READ | VM_WRITE | VM_EXEC | VM_GROWSUP |
VM_DENYWRITE)
Why is this happening? I need to have both read and write access to region.
How do I fix this ?
Thanks for you help
