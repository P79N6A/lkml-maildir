Hm, where do you get the idea that sprinkling functions with printks will 
in any way improve the situation and result in clean code? Yes, it works 
around the bug, but so will an infinite number of other things.
By far the best solution is to move them into a different compilation unit 
- i.e. your first patch - i'll apply that one.
