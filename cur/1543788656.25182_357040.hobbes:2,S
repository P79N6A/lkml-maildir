I will try to do that tomorrow. 
I forgot to mention, all this is with the SMP kernel running on a dual
core Athlon, PREEMPT_DESKTOP and HZ=1000. 
The symptoms would seem to indicate some basic problem with timing and
what is reported to userspace (ie: wrong warnings about delayed
interrupts in Jack - I hear no audible problems and the time difference
reported by Jack keeps growing no matter what I do, seems to only be
realted to the time the kernel has been up, key repeat on X speeds up,
apparently the screensaver kicks in randomly, etc).
