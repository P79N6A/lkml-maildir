erm, per virtual web domain or per child?  additional web domains -don't-
need to take more descriptors unless you choose to have individual log files
per each which is really silly.
use the more advanced logging features and reduce your logfile count
considerably.  this has an immense performance benefit on a busy site.  no
cross disk seeking to update individual logs.  less file descriptors to
select on, etc, etc.
