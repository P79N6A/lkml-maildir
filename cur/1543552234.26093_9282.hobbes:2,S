With my patch applied:

(time passes, and I send some data)

Ok, this surely is incorrect. However, sending spurious SYNACK packets
doesn't seem like the way to solve this problem. I know it complicates the
kernel, but if we do connection preprocessing, shouldn't we also do teardown
in case of timeout?
Thanks for the explanation.
