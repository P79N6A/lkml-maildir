Well if you find a way to make those symbols disappear from the
object files without using ".L", please let me know. I spent
some considerable time beautifying multiple assembly-language
files on a recent project, only to find that it would fail to
link because of the "multiple symbol definition" errors. I
had to change everything back.
You can make labels like ".Lresume:" remain visible only in
the file. They don't need to be numbers. It may even be possible
to use labels like ".L_resume:", I haven't tried. Basically, if
they show up using `nm`, they can (read will) give you problems.
Cheers,
