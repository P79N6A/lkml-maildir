Okay, the main reason why I needed to do this was so that a make clean
would get the proper directory path. The problem was that machdir-y
wasn't getting the board name correctly since at make clean time the
CONFIG_SH_xxx names weren't being resolved.
Thus, in the case of:
core-y                          += arch/sh/boards/$(machdir-y)/
make clean was only getting arch/sh/boards/, which doesn't have a
Makefile in it, which resulted in an error when doing the clean.
I'll admit I haven't spent much time investigating this further and just
used the .config include as a quick workaround, so if there's a better
solution for this, I'll gladly adopt it.

I haven't looked at the i386 code for this yet, I'll look into this.

Not merged yet, will be shortly. I just wanted to get the board stuff
out of the way.

Thanks for catching this, I'll clean that up.
