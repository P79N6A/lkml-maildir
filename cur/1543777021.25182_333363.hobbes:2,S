Imagine my surprise when I noticed that the reason someone didn't
know about using the sg_dma_len() and sg_dma_address() with the
dma_map_sg() calls was that they weren't documented except as
part of the old PCI-specific pci_map_sg() API.  Bleech!
So, this patch fixes that little problem, mostly by cut/paste.

+With scatterlists, you use the resulting mapping like this:
+
+	int i, count = dma_map_sg(dev, sglist, nents, direction);
+	struct scatterlist *sg;
+
+	for (i = 0, sg = sglist; i < count; i++, sg++) {
+		hw_address[i] = sg_dma_address(sg);
+		hw_len[i] = sg_dma_len(sg);
+	}
+
+where nents is the number of entries in the sglist.
+
+The implementation is free to merge several consecutive sglist entries
+into one (e.g. if DMA mapping is done with PAGE_SIZE granularity, any
+consecutive sglist entries can be merged into one provided the first one
+ends and the second one starts on a page boundary - in fact this is a huge
+advantage for cards which either cannot do scatter-gather or have very
+limited number of scatter-gather entries) and returns the actual number
+of sg entries it mapped them to. On failure 0 is returned.
+
+Then you should loop count times (note: this can be less than nents times)
+and use sg_dma_address() and sg_dma_len() macros where you previously
+accessed sg->address and sg->length as shown above.
