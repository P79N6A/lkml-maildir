I wonder if, for our purposes, we could first issue the int13 fn41 (check
extensions present) as we do before calling fn48 later.  This doesn't read
the disk itself, and hopefully can return immediately with a failure on
the nonexistant device, thus we can stop before reading the MBR.  No one
has indicated that the fn41 or fn48 code causes any delay, only the fn02
(read sectors)...
