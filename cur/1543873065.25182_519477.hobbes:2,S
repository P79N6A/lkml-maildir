When you said idle I thought idle and not waiting for I/O. Waiting for
I/O would be hardly a kernel issue ;). If they're not waiting for I/O
and they're not scheduling in userland with nanosleep/pause, the cpu
shouldn't go idle. Even if they're calling sched_yield in a loop the
cpu should account for zero idle time as far as I can tell.
