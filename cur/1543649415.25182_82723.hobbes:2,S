What the standard says is that only one signal is to be
queued for a given timer.  Subsequent expires of the same
timer then just bump the overrun count.  This is what the
patch does, but still this could overload the timer list and
interrupt code, so in addition to the standard required
overrun stuff, the code checks the next expire time and
fudges a time at least X microseconds from now, where the
time is a multiple (Y) of the repeat time + the current
expire time.  Y is then added to the overrun count to
account for the missing expires.

Yes, the signal code needs to check for that pending timer. 
And NOW (i.e. 2.5) it can be in either the shared list or
the local list or both :(.  This is in the patch.

I would be open to requiring a capability to run the repeat
time below a fixed value if this would make folks happier. 
It would send the right message to the user, too, i.e. small
repeat counts can be hazardous to your system.

The interesting thing is that we don't currently have an in
kernel call such as delay, etc.  You just use add_timer(). 
AND none of the possible interfaces I have seen or
considered even hint at needing repeating timers.
