There has been at least my complaint about udev not being able to
auto-load modules on /dev entry lookup (28th March 2006):
« Given a freshly booted linux box, hence uinput is not loaded (why
would it be, it doesn't drive any real hardware) ; what is the right
way(tm) for an application to have the uinput module loaded, so that it
can open /dev/input/uinput for emulating keypresses?
- With good-old static /dev, we could just open /dev/input/uinput
  (installed by the distribution), and thanks to a
  alias char-major-10-223 uinput
  line somewhere in /etc/modprobe.d, uinput gets auto-loaded.
- With devfs, it doesn't look like it works (/dev/misc/uinput is not
  present and opening it just like if it existed doesn't work). But I
  read in archives that it could be feasible.
- With udev, this just cannot work. As explained in an earlier thread,
  even using a special filesystem that would report the opening attempt
  to udevd wouldn't work fine since udevd takes time for creating the
  device, and hence the original program needs to be notified ; this
  becomes racy.
So what is the correct way to do it? I can see two approaches:
Using modprobe:
- try to use /dev/input/uinput ; if it succeeds, fine.
- else, if errno != ENOENT, fail
- else, (ENOENT)
  - try to call `cat /proc/sys/kernel/modprobe` uinput
  - try to use /dev/input/uinput again ; if it succeeds, fine
    - else, assume that it really wasn't compiled, and hence fail.
Triggering auto-load by creating one's own node.
- try to use /dev/input/uinput ; if it suceeds, fine.
- else, if errno != ENOENT, fail
- else, (ENOENT)
  - mknod /somewhere/safe/uinput c 10 223
  - use /somewhere/safe/uinput ; if it succeeds, fine
    - else, assume that it really wasn't compiled, and hence fail.

Neither solution looks good to me... Just opening /dev/input/uinput
should be sufficient, and udev doesn't let that for now.
The same situation holds for other virtual devices (loop, snd-seq-dummy,
...).
