	What, no alpha? (grin) 
"Waitor, give that man a Multia with a lemon twist! Shaken, not stirred..."  
	All seriousness aside, I'll apply 2.2.2ac1 to a clean 2.2.2
tree and work from there this evening.  My EV56 has been running a 
patched 2.2.2final for the past five hours with no problems.  It needs
closer scrutiny so it will /just/ get rid of the uncompilable stuff
without touching the (compilable) new code.
