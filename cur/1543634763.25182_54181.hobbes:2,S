Not exactly sure who to email this to so,  to whomever cares -
	hopefully this isn't old news, I tried a 1024x768 logo and got a
kernel panic.   
	I traced it down to one line of code in /drivers/video/fbcon.c
	Attached is a patch file that seems to fix the problem.  I am not
sure if this fix is absolutely correct.
	NOTE: The patch does NOT include changing the LOGO_W and LOGO_H
lines to 1024 and 768,  nor does it include a linux_logo.h file with a
1024x768 logo.
