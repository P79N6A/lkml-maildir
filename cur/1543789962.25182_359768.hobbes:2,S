I'm the maintainer of the busybox mount command.  We've had /etc/mtab support 
be optional (you can configure it out) for a while now.
There was some fancy footwork trying to get umount to automatically free loop 
devices and such, but as far as I know that's all resolved in subversion and 
if we can ever get a 1.1 release out, it should all just work...
