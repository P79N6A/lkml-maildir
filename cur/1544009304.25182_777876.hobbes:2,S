No, it's not. 5:1 is _in_ the kernel, and must not be tried to be
loaded by the kernel. We need to make /dev/console access return
-ENODEV if not available, not try to load a module for it.
It is a problem. It's broken behavior, and it breaks shipped products
with any innocent future driver change like Herbert's.
Please start to think about the problem, and don't repeat things that
do not make sense, and never made any sense.
Thanks,
