I agree with your points.  I thought about making it display both.
But I didn't want to worry about breaking scripts that parse console
logs or whatever.  Personally I don't think I've ever found the ppid
in that display useful in debugging a ptrace issue.  I don't have any
special opinions about this display.  I just went on a little crusade
to get rid of task_struct.parent uses that aren't specifically for
its ptrace/wait purpose.
Thanks,
Roland
