Yes, I meant set_pte_pfn; set_pmd_pfn is a typo.
Fixmap slots are global, not percpu; you may be thinking of kmap_atomic, 
which reserves percpu fixmap slots for its use.  Most uses of set_fixmap 
are early in boot, where preemption (or other CPUs) isn't a factor.  The 
exception is mapping the compat vdso global mapping.   However, that is 
special-cased anyway, since the set_fixmap is followed by an explicit 
all-cpu tlb flush.
It seems to me that the correct fix is to just make __set_fixmap disable 
preemption for its duration; it probably doesn't make much difference 
for the native case, and it makes Xen happy.
