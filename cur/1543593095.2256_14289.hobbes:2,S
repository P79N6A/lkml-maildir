Hello All,
    This is probably an FAQ, but I read the FAQ and its not in there.
I have a machine with 2G of memory.  I compiled the kernel with the 4G memory
option.  How much address space should each process be able to address?  Does
this change if I use the 64G option?  I'm after 2.4 information.  Right now
I am running on a 2.2 kernel and it looks like the user processes are limited
to ~1G.
Thanks,
Jim
