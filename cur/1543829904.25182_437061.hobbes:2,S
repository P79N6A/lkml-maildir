Exact. But, the idea was to retrieve the namespace from the routes.
IMHO, I think there are roughly 2 network isolation implementation:
	- make all network ressources private to the namespace
	- keep a "flat" model where network ressources have a new identifier 
which is the network namespace pointer. The idea is to move only some 
network informations private to the namespace (eg port range, stats, ...)
