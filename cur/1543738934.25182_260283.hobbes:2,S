yep to test it would be helpful. To setup mine, it took not long, but sure
such a facility could help. But you know, if you do not run make clean, and you
have edited usr/Makefile to not rebuild initramfs, puting your custom cpio
archive into usr and typing 'make' won't take long to rebuild the new kernel :)
I did that to get it working.
As to know if having an external archive file loaded by grub or so, I don't
know much that part of the kernel code... Hum, I really did not try to under-
stand the code involving initrd's and initramfs in init/do_mounts_initrd.c.
I wonder whether putting an executable /init in an initrd is sufficient to
have it recognized as an initramfs and not an initrd....
The important thing is /init executable script in initramfs, this is what
tells the kernel to override the "standard" way it boots.
