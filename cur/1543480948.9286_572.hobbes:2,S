According to my experience, there is a problem with Quantum Fireball
drives, not with linux. I once had two 3 GB scsi Quantum FB. Both died
within one year (first they have a hard time spinning up, and, after
two months, they are not detected anymore).
As far as I know, among very cheap drives, IBM and Seagate drives are
much better. Do not quote me on this, though. Cheap drives are not
intended to spin on a permanent basis, so your mileage may vary.
