  I meant the identity the process uses to access the filesystem (to
identify the user who caused the limit excess) and also the identity stored
in the quota file (to identify whose quota was exceeded).
  Anyway, any identity more complicated than just a number needs changes in
both quota file format and filesystems so at that moment, we can also
change the netlink interface...

  Then one wonders whether user namespaces are really what users want ;).
