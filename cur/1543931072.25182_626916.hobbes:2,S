Yep, I will fix this.

Right now yes. There was a code which used single bit for bigger
data units, but I dropped it because of resync troubles (i.e. when
one single sector has been updated, it requires to resync the whole
block). I can not say which case is better though.

generic_make_request() will queue the bio in this case,
so I call request_fn directly.

Yes, you are right of course.
Since I shift word to more than a single bit, @num has to be update
accordingly.

Dmitry, thanks a lot for comments, I will fix issues you pointed in the
next release, although will stay bitmap case opened for a while.
