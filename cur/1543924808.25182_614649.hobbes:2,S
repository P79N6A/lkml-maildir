Subject: [PATCH] Add the macro to test if "exactly_one_bit_set" to log2.h.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/6/155

While this macro is defined in terms of "is_power_of_2" and is
therefore functionally equivalent, the visual semantics are sometimes
more appropriate for what is actually being tested.
