argh. that would be the *one* definition whose output got chopped
because of line continuation, and it would be only one that actually
uses the argument:
#define ZERO_PAGE(vaddr) \
        (virt_to_page((void *)(empty_zero_page + (((unsigned long)(vaddr)) & zero_page_mask))))
but it still leaves the question -- if ZERO_PAGE is meant to represent
a single, global shared page that is always zero, why would it *ever*
need to take an argument?  and what's so special about MIPS that it
differs from all the rest?
