One problem we ran into was that there are only 32 multicast groups per 
netlink protocol family.
We had a situation where we could have used netlink, but we needed the 
equivalent of thousands of multicast groups.  Latency was very 
important, so we ended up doing essentially a multicast unix socket 
rather than taking the extra penalty for UDP multicast.
