I think 1122 is about host requirements. Thats probably it, but if my
memory is bad, do a search for 'host' and 'requirements'.
The behavior of Linux in this area that is mostly in dispute is:
 eth1 - [linux] - eth2
where eth1 is set to 192.168.1.1/24
and eth2 is set to 192.168.2.1/24
Linux will respond to an arp for 192.168.2.1 on eth1 and vice versa. Even
more amusing.. Linux will happly talk as 192.168.2.1 on eth1.
