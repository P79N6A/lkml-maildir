David, I wanted to add that we formalized the locking rules on
avenrun[3] a couple kernel revisions ago.
In 2.4, I believe it is implicitly assumed you will do a cli() before
accessing the data (if you want all 3 values to be in sync you need the
read to be safe).
In 2.5, grab a read_lock on xtime_lock and go at it.
