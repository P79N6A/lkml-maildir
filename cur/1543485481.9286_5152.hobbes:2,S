Yes.  I've already got a "sard" system working, which provides output
in the manner of "sar -d", ie. proper disk profiling on a per-disk and
per-partition basis.  It includes average queue utilisation, average
queue length plus transfer stats.
The code so far is at 
    
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/fs
and I'd love to hear from you if you're interested in helping to
extend this into a full sar replacement.
