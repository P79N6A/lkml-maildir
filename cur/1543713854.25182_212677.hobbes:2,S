Yeah, it needs to be a separate kernel for huge blobby machines. I think
that's exactly what RH does, IIRC (> 16GB ?)

Speaking of which, pte_highmem is stinking expensive itself. There's
probably a large class of workloads that'd work with out pte_highmem
if we had 4/4 split (or shared pagetables. Grrr ;-))
