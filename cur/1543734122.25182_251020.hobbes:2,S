Ok, in that case microcode_ctl is right about "/dev/cpu/microcode" and 
distributions need to change to match it. Indeed, it always seemed silly 
to me to "pretend" that the microcode device node is "per cpu" in some 
sense (as it is impossible under Linux to bind userspace app to a given 
cpu then there is no "good" sense in which "per cpu" node can be defined).
Kind regards
