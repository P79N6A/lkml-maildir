Ok, that's actually better than a _real_ M386. At least M486 has most of 
the new instructions statically. But the SMP thing obviously makes a big 
difference.
Can you get your tester to try "ctrl + scroll-lock" to see if it outputs 
anything?

Well, SMP ends up being a big issue, and adds tons of things. It would be 
very interesting to hear whether a M686 _UP_ kernel shows the same 
problem.
