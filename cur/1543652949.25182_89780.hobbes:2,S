That's really a make problem. It gets much worse when you count in times  
going backwards because you restore a file from backup, or whatever.
What I'd really like make to do - but it can't with the current design -  
is to note the exact time stamp of each dependency when creating a target,  
and when reconsidering that target, finding out if any of those time  
stamps have changed in any way (and, while we're at it, probably check the  
size as well). *Changed since last time*, not younger than the target.
But of course to do that, you need a persistent repository for those time  
stamps - which, I think, kbuild-Owen does.
If you think about the more tricky things to do with make, this is almost  
always what you would need to make a solution much easier.
Take network time shift, for example. Once you no longer need a younger- 
older relation, that time shift is actually completely irrelevant!
One of these days, when I have lots of time (as if!) ...
