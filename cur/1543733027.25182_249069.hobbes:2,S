Dave,
There's no real disagreement that the best way to do things would be have 
everything come down nicely packaged from the distro vendor.  (Certainly with 
my TG hat on, that is how we'd like to see things work - it's obviously easier 
for us.)  Historically it just didn't work though, and even into the future, 
no matter what changes, I can still see a requirement for binary snapshots or 
downloadable drivers.
With the new LK "always stable" development model, one barrier to this ideal 
of fast distribution of drivers seems to have fallen.   This is perhaps the 
biggest change, and I admit the implications have only just started to sink in.
Dave Airlie taking a pro-active role as DRM maintainer is also a recent change 
- for a long time that code was a neglected corner of the XFree86 tree, now 
it's starting to look like a first-class project in its own right and is 
getting more of the attention it needs to beat it into shape.
The remaining question mark is the process of pushing the userspace drivers 
out.  I floated a proposal recently to loosely synchronize Xorg and Mesa 
release schedules which might help a little, but there is still a potentially 
long delay affecting the userspace parts of a driver in their progress to 
vendors & ultimately users.  Ultimately you're right that splitting that tree 
up & letting the parts evolve independently might address the problems there, 
though that's at least two X releases away.
In the meantime, though, downloadable binary drivers continue to be a useful 
testing aid for the DRI project (their original intent), and a convenient 
bandaid for working around a distribution channel which I think will probably 
be pretty slow for a year or more to come.
