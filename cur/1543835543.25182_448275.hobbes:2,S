To reproduce (on x86-64 at least)
mkdir obj
cd obj
make -C ../linux-2.6.18-... O=$(pwd) defconfig
make

The echo didn't output for some reason, but adding it to the error gives
/home/lsrc/quilt/linux/Makefile:456: *** triggered by /home/lsrc/quilt/linux/drivers/net/wireless/Kconfig /home/lsrc/quilt/linux/drivers/message/fusion/Kconfig /home/lsrc/quilt/linux/net/ieee80211/Kconfig /home/lsrc/quilt/linux/net/netfilter/Kconfig kernel configuration not valid - run 'make prepare' in /home/lsrc/quilt/linux to update it.  Stop.
