I do not think good style is best defined by majority vote.

    Well, it seems you are in the (slight) minority on this one.  It's not as
    big a margin as the other ones, but still measurable.  I wasn't able to
    find any examples from the King Penguin himself on this one.
Read old kernel sources.
        de = (struct minix_dir_entry *) (offset + bh->b_data);
	:"S" ((long) name),"D" ((long) buffer),"c" (len)
	if (32 != sizeof (struct minix_inode))
