Sorry, do you really believe a ring is "often" the case?  It's not
entirely trivial to audit, but I can do a random sample of 100
list_heads.
The list iterators reinforce the "standalone head" model (ie. it's not
called list_for_each_other_entry), and they're pretty popular.

I agree it's a wonderful feature, but you talk about "no head" but
they're all called "list_head"?  In my version, they'd all be list_node,
and you can trivially treat it as a head with ->h.
It's a little more work for rings, but it's more explicit and gives us
type checking on the common case.
Thanks for your consideration,
Rusty.
