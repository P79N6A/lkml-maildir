It also has the advantage that events are handled in reliable and repeatable
order.
Right now, if you plug and then quickly unplug a device, the unplug event can
be handled first.
It may not happen much in practice, but we have had problem with cardbus
contact bounce causing an event storm in the past.  The daemon could just
swallow the first 5 insert/remove pairs and process the final insert only.
The kernel would have to drop messages on the floor at some point though.
