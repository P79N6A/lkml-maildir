Out of interest, how do you ensure the process doesn't stop for that
long right now?  Linux doesn't guarantee you'll get scheduled
(strictly speaking) in n milliseconds usually.

Lots of really complicated and unnecessary things are common in the
telecoms world.
For the example you gave I can think of several ways to migrate data
to a new process (if need be) in a timely manner without interruption.
None of these *require* live patching.

How does this *require* live patching?

Those are just marketing words.

Love patching seems like a very complicated thing to get right and it
could potentially blow up.
I'm guessing any suggestion of fixing the applications behavior would
be lost with some argument along the lines of: "this application was
written in 1824 by Ada Lovelace using pre-Roswell Alien Technology and
was certified NEBS compliant by the Deli Lama and god herself, so
clearly we can't touch a single line of it" or similar right?
