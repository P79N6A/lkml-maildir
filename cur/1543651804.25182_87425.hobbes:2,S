What is your gcc version?
Mine is 3.2, and it sometimes de-inline large inline functions.
That is, static inlines turn into simple static. And extern inlines
in dangling extern references, that's what bite you maybe ;)
Do not blindly fix it, think of it as a warning:
"gcc: your inline is too large"
For example,
static __inline__ int DQUOT_ALLOC_SPACE_NODIRTY(struct inode *inode, qsize_t nr)
{
        lock_kernel();
        if (sb_any_quota_enabled(inode->i_sb)) {
                /* Used space is updated in alloc_space() */
                if (inode->i_sb->dq_op->alloc_space(inode, nr, 0) == NO_QUOTA) {
                        unlock_kernel();
                        return 1;
                }
        }
        else
                inode_add_bytes(inode, nr);
        unlock_kernel();
        return 0;
}
static __inline__ int DQUOT_ALLOC_SPACE(struct inode *inode, qsize_t nr)
{
        int ret;
        if (!(ret = DQUOT_ALLOC_SPACE_NODIRTY(inode, nr)))
                mark_inode_dirty(inode);
        return ret;
}
Don't you think DQUOT_ALLOC_SPACE is _way too large_ to inline?
Did you look at generated assembly to get a feeling of it's size?
