The patches are missing signed-off-by so please resend. I am starting
my vacation on friday so I suggest you send the whole driver as a
patch for review at netdev@vger.kernel.org for inclusion. I can apply
your patches to
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/penberg/netdev-ipg-2.6.git
if you want, though. Only the first three patches apply and everything
starting from "ipg_config_autoneg rewrite' fail.
