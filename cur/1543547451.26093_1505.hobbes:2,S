Hi all.
I'd installed the backport of the USB patch (to 2.2.16) and had the 
following problem:
After a few inches of printing a graphics page (ghostscript output), the
whole printing job would just hang. Only exit was switching the printer
on/off and removing the print job. The printer is an HP810C and (I suspect)
the problem is at the VIA chipset (VT82C586).
After a few frustrating tries, I moved to kernel 2.4.0-test7, suspecting
that maybe there was a problem with the backport. Results:
Exactly the same print problem: hangs after 5 - 10 cm of printing a
graphics page (text mode works ok).
But, after installing 2.4.0, yesterday, I had two misterious hangs of the
operating system - apparently nothing to do with the tasks that were
running - they were completely different.
Just in case: the printer is driven by the apsfilter, which works fine
when using the parallel port.
Thanks on beforehand!
John
