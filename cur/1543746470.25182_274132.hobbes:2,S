Enabling the MII module/driver before loading the tulip board fixes the 
problem; I was curious what is the difference of the following:
1) No MII in physical HW and no SW driver loaded (mii module/driver)
2) No MMI in physical HW and sw driver loaded (what I have now, no warnings)
3) An MII in physical HW and no SW driver (better performance?)
I have not tried it with kernel 2.4.x.
To fix it, just make sure mii gets loaded before the tulip driver, or 
compile both of them in and you will not get the warnings.
