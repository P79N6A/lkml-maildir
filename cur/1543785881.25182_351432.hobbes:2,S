Just the menuconfig (mconf) at first. OTOH it might make sense to
move them all.

Sure, that's what I mean. It's used for configuring the kernel, but
other packages use it (well, some version) too. Example: busybox.
There is no much point in keeping more than one copy. They are
completely independent of the kernel, all the kernel wants is to pass
them some Kconfig file and expect data in .config. (oldconfig uses
.config.old).
There is a question about config language and possible future changes.
Not a serious problem IMHO.

It's not exactly the case.
