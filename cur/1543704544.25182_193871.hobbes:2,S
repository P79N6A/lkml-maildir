Andi,
I applied the early-printk patch to 2.6.2-rc1 and here's the serial
output I got, before the system just stopped booting:

Here's the copied odwn output from tty0, my regular console:
       Booting '2.6.2-rc1'

     savedefault
     boot
     Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.
And that's it.  I'll see about applying the patch to the various
2.6.2-rc1-mm kernels as well, and possibly to 2.6.2-rc2, which I just
got downloaded.  Hmmm... I'll try that one first actually and try to
get more info out tonight.
