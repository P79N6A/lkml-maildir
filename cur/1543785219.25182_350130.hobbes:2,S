There's a fix for the megaraid issue floating around on this list.
The correct solution is for all drivers to understand scatterlists.
This is actually true of most of them; there are just a few scsi
emulators that didn't for certain commands.  These emulators are already
broken, since if these commands came via SG_IO, they'd be scatterlist
based, so the correct fix is in the emulators.
