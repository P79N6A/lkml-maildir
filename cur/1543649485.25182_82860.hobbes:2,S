Japanese keycodes/keymapping support! We are very happy. IMHO To realize
this, emulations include shift-state modifier are needed??
Please point me where is source code, and we don't touch defkeymaps.

I think it's for emergency(or rescue) purpose. For example, system cannot
boot due to illegal kanji named file, input kenji to select one and change
it. We plan direct character code input. In kanji-mode, do convert from
hex numeric input to kanji. But not implemented yet.

Yes. Desktop PC-9800 has Ten-key pad. But doesn't have NumLock key!
Perhaps BIOS initialize always NumLock ON.
Note book PC-9800 has NumLock key. But NumLock key never send scancode,
do change scancode internaly.

I see.

Due to our implementation of console driver. For old PC-9800, we use only
video ram. If don't, scrolling is _very_ slow. So our console can scroll
less than half lines of screen. If call with 0, screen doesn't scroll.

I'll remove it. Thanks.

IMHO Those (pc_keyb.h too) are remaining to compile user mode application.
I think it's a very rare, but ....
