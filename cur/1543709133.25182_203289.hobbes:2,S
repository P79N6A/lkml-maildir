I've searched the archives as well as googled around without any luck
regarding my situation.  BTW, please CC me as I'm no longer subscribed
(furthering my education has prevented me from keeping up with the
list).
Anyways, I have the following two network cards:
02:04.0 Ethernet controller: 3Com Corporation 3c905B 100BaseTX [Cyclone]

Using 2.4.x (including the latest stable), I've had no trouble getting
these cards to work as modules.  However, when I upgraded to 2.6.0 I
couldn't get them to work as modules, but finally tried compiling them
into the kernel and all was well until 2.6.4-rc1.  Now, no matter what I
do, compiled in or as modules, I can not get both cards working.
The structure of the network is:
eth0 is the Intel card - internal network (alias eth0 e100)
eth1 is the 3Com card - cable modem (alias eth1 3c59x)
When attempting to compile 2.6.4-rc1 with modules, I see this in the
logs:
Feb 28 22:31:29 jupiter kernel: 3c59x: Donald Becker and others.
www.scyld.com/network/vortex.html
Feb 28 22:31:29 jupiter kernel: 0000:02:04.0: 3Com PCI 3c905B Cyclone
100baseTx at 0xa000. Vers LK1.1.19
Feb 28 22:31:29 jupiter kernel: e100: Intel(R) PRO/100 Network Driver,
3.0.15
Feb 28 22:31:29 jupiter kernel: e100: Copyright(c) 1999-2004 Intel
Corporation
Feb 28 22:31:29 jupiter kernel: e100: eth1: e100_probe: addr 0xfb024000,
irq 16, MAC addr 00:ED:20:7F:3A:55
As you can see, e100 is coming up as eth1, which is not correct.  I
assume 3c59x has probably grabbed eth0, which also is not correct.  When
configured for modules, is eth0 always the first card found?  At any
rate, I tried switching the cables on the network cards to see if it
would work like that, but unfortunately it didn't.
Can anyone please give me some clue as to what might be wrong?  My
network is working fine with the drivers compiled in 2.6.3 (but not as
modules).  I can't get 2.6.4-rc1 to work at all with my network cards.
Please help!  (Please CC me)
Thanks,
Steve
