I don't think you need to do anything beyond io_remap_pfn_range().
Look at the comment inside remap_pfn_range() in mm/memory.c.
You may want VM_DONTCOPY for fork() handling I guess.

As a side note, why do you use both dma_alloc_coherent() and
pci_alloc_consistent()?  Presumably all the allocations are for the
same underlying device, so why not just pick one interface (probably
dma_alloc_coherent(), since it lets you specify the GFP mask).

You probably want VM_RESERVED.  I don't think you want VM_IO (these
pages are in RAM), and there's not much point to VM_SHM, since it's
currently defined as:
#define VM_SHM          0x00000000      /* Means nothing: delete it later */
VM_DONTEXPAND is fine, although you could handle it in your NOPAGE
method too.  And VM_DONTCOPY is just as above -- it might make fork()
work better for you.

I think you should always be doing a get_page().  As far as I know,
there's always a put_page() when the userspace mapping is torn down,
and things are going to get pretty bad if a page count goes below 0.
