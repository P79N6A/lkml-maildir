Hi,
I've a trivial patch against kernel/module.c for 2.4.19 below that 
fixes a problem with the initialisation of a stack of modules.  
Though it rarely occurs, without this the kernel can crash when a module 
is being initialised and before this initialisation finishes another 
*dependent* module is loaded.  This occurs when the first module blocks 
in init_module and releases the big kernel lock.  I discussed this earlier 
with Keith Owens but it looks like its been forgotten:
