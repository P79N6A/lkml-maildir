Hi,
I have a little problem with my fileserver running kernel 2.6.0-test9
I have recently installed a 3rd IDE controller in the box, and Linux doesn't 
find it. I searched the archives for solutions for my problem, and found 
that there's a hardcoded limit in the kernel which only allows 10 IDE 
channels. I tried changing MAX_HWIFS in ide.h and also the name assignment 
code in ide.c, and now the kernel at least finds my controller, though disks 
cannot be used. I get this error during boot:
HPT37X: using 33MHz PCI clock
    idea: BM-DMA at 0x9800-0x9807, BIOS settings: hdu:DMA, hdv:DMA
    ideb: BM-DMA at 0x9808-0x980f, BIOS settings: hdw:DMA, hdx:DMA
...
idea: I/O resource 0xA402-0xA402 not free.
hdu: ERROR, PORTS ALREADY IN USE
hdv: ERROR, PORTS ALREADY IN USE
ideb: I/O resource 0x9C02-0x9C02 not free.
hdw: ERROR, PORTS ALREADY IN USE
hdx: ERROR, PORTS ALREADY IN USE
Is there anyone who have had this problem, and is there a solution for it?
Regards,
Lars
