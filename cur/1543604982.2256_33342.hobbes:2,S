Well, I have to say that I personally have always considered the "die"
lock to not be about multiple CPU re-entrancy, but _exactly_ to stop
infinite oops reports if an oops itself oopses.
I much prefer a dead machine with a partially visible oops over a oops
where the original oops has scrolled away due to recursive faults.
Quite frankly, I consider the ia64 case to be a ia64 bug, nothing more.
