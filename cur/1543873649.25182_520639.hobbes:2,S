Well testing that is not so fun.  I installed SUSE Pro 9.0, and strings 
on ld.so contains the magic at_sysinfo assert!  But it doesn't install 
TLS libraries, so I'll have to install them by hand.
In works - in theory.  Look, a puppy!
Scratchbox is rumored to produce the fabled assertion even on modern 
distros by installing its own toolchain which includes the dreaded glibc.

Will do.

I'm playing safe.  Binary identical relocation to 0xffffe000 was my goal.

Walk based on size instead?

Hmm, I can try that.  Thanks for the suggestions / fixes.
