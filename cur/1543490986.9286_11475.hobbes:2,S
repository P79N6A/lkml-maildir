This "proves?"  This "proves" nothing.  The only thing this comes close
to proving is that Ziff-Davis can once again deliver an ASCII bytestream
devoid of any real content save a single quote and the reporter's
speculation.  It could have been better phrased like, "I went to a
conference, Stallman said the same thing he's said for years, and
people talked about it." 
Could you point me to the clause in the GNU General Public License that
revokes a developer's priveledge to license software under the terms of
the GPL if said developer expressly disagrees with something a Mr.
Richard
Stallman had verbally expressed at any location on any date either prior 
to or after the conception of the term of the license?  I must have
missed
the section where one is legally obligated to think his same thoughts.
