The importance people attach to loadaverages continues to amaze me. Two
systems doing the same work can have wildly different loadaverages. If I
code a big statemachine with lots of poll() interfaces, my loadaverage will
not get a lot higher then 1.
Should I forego writing a statemachine and use pthreads or fork(), the same
amount of work will keep lots of different processes busy and raise my
loadaverage wildly.
Do you now state that the second situation is somehow 'worse'?
Feel free however to stop using Linux. Or to quote the document Al refered
to 'See figure 1'.
Kind regards,
