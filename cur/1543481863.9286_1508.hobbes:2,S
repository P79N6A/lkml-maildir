Howdy,
I've just tried to install 2.2.0-pre9 (unpatched).   Here's a little
report ...
1) I have an AMD K6, Stepping B (yes, the bad one) processor.   2.2.0
compared to 2.1.132 gives more sig11 errors, suggesting that the memory
handling routines has changed.   Which, in turn, made me unable to do
some 'serious' testing.
2) A 'ls -l' in a directory containing a few files takes quite some
time.   It lists say 5 files, then wait a couple of seconds, then list
the rest.   'tar' shows the same behaviour.
3) Isdn is _broken_.  It was broken back in 2.2.0-pre1, but I had hoped
that it was fixed.   For some reason, I can connect _once_.   Further
connections succeed, but no IP-traffic is routed.    What is the proper
way to upgrade the ISDN so that it works with 2.2.0?   (I've downloaded
isdn4k-utils-3.0beta1 - but it doesn't give me any kernel changes!)
... I'm stepping back to 2.1.132 for a while   ;o)
Kind regards,
Brian
