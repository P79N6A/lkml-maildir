i've released the -S3 VP patch:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc2-mm1-S3
most importantly, -S3 fixes the SMP+PREEMPT bug reported by K.R. Foley. 
It was a bug in BKL-preemption: forced preemption still caused automatic
dropping of the BKS - this is bad and broke fs/locks.c. (The race could
occur on UP+PREEMPT too but it has never been reproduced there.)
other changes since -S2:
 - introduced a CONFIG_PREEMPT_BKL - just in case there are other
   problems. This can be used to turn BKL preemption on/off. Can be 
   useful for performance tests as well.
 - fixed a couple of more smp_processor_id() false positives.
 - cleaned up hardirq.c some more
