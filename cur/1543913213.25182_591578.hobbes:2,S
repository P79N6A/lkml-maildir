Sure.
That means you can't use a work without obtaining a licence first
(unless you are the copyright holder and don't need (can't have)
the licence).
I.e., as the author, you don't have to write those "copyright xxx"
and the work is still protected.

Yes, it hasn't been *lost*. It just never existed :-)
(with exception of those things starting 40 or so years after the
original publication, I think we can safely skip this part).
Obviously, the copyright holder is free to distribute the work
under a different licence next time (but (s)he has to make sure it's
ok with licences (s)he uses, if it's a derived work).
