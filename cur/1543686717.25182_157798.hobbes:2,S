Correct. Cache line alignment is advisory. Slab debugging is not the 
only case that violates the alignment, for example 32-byte allocations 
are not padded to the 128 byte cache line size of the Pentium 4 cpus. I 
really doubt we want that.
Have you looked at pci_pool_{create,alloc,free,destroy}? The functions 
were specifically written to provide aligned buffers for DMA operations. 
Perhaps SCSI should use them?
