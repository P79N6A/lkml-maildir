Hi,
There is brain-damaged sound chip which is identified by two separate 
PNP ids. This was done probably to keep backward compatibility (the 
first id is for the old type of chip, the second id gives only one 
additional io range required for newer chips).
How to does properly detect such a device using the PNP framework?
Is there any way to specify two PNP ids as one device?
Is it better to iterate over a pnpbios protocol of the first device to 
find out if there is the second id? This way has an advantage that I can 
distinguish between old chip (no the second id found) and newer chips 
(the second id found).
Thank you in advance answer,
Krzysztof
