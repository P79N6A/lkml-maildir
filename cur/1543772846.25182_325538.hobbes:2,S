using "dev=/dev/hda" yeilds the exact same behavior...
   Jun 14 03:21:50 localhost kernel: ide-cd: cmd 0x3 timed out
   Jun 14 03:21:50 localhost kernel: hda: lost interrupt
   Jun 14 03:22:50 localhost kernel: ide-cd: cmd 0x3 timed out
   Jun 14 03:22:50 localhost kernel: hda: lost interrupt
   Jun 14 03:23:30 localhost kernel: hda: lost interrupt
And I'm a little confused by Robert's suggestion... Should it
ever be possible for a user-space application to cause lost
interrupts and other kernel state problems regardless of what
"interface" is used?? Sure, if the application uses the wrong
interface it should get spanked somehow but should it be able to
mess up the kernel for other applications as well? (Like now
I can't read or eject.)
The output from the cdrecord command was:

Since the kernel gets messed up and reports losts interrupts I'm
inclined to believe that this is a kernel/driver issue and not my
misuse of an application/interface. Though I realize cdrecord is
being run as the superuser and therefore might be overiding some
kernel security checks and messing with the kernel so I might be
wrong about that.
One question comes to mind... Would Robert's suggestion and my
results be affected by the fact that I don't have Packet Writing
for CD drives turned on the current kernel?
Any other ideas?
