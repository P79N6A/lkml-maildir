Thank you. I applied this patch, and recompiled my kernel.
All works fine, if the size of root filesystem less than 4096Kb. But 
when i create
an image of root filesystem which size is bigger than 4096Mb, the kernel 
said:
...
RAMDISK driver initialized: 16 RAM disks of 4096K size 4096 blocksize
...
RAMDISK: cramfs filesystem found at block 0  
RAMDISK: Loading 2300 blocks [1 disk] into ram disk... done.
...
Freeing unused kernel memory: 116k freed  
Algorithmics/MIPS FPU Emulator v1.4
Error -3 while decompressing!     
804172a4(-166740)->803da000(4096)      
bash#
As you can see, the size of image is only 2300kb.
The kernel command line is:
root=/dev/ram init=/bin/bash ramdisk_blocksize=4096
When i tried to mount this image on a running kernel it is all OK.
# mount -o loop -t cramfs cramfsdisk.bin /mnt/ramdisk
# chroot /mnt/ramdisk /bin/bash
I already asked Matthias, but he said that he didn't try cramfs for
ram disks larger than 4k. Did anybody try it? Does anybody work on
cramfs now?
