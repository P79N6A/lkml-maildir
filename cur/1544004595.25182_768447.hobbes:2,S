pthreads is implemented in glibc.
If you really think there is a bug in the ptheads implementation then 
the glibc maintainers will require you to produce a simple example program 
which demonstrates the bug before it's accepted as a bug.
When you say processes you mean threads, right?
If you can't produce such an example program and you can you prove (to 
yourself) there are no use after free or execution order issues with your 
code then your only option is to develop a workaround.
You code wouldn't happen to be doing thread synchronization with 
pthread_cond_wait()/pthread_cond_signal() would it?
