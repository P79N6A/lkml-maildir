No, unfortunatly :(
Actually, the documentation that was written in this patch series, would
be good to replace the existing kobject documentation in LDD 3.  But
it's a bit hard to just replace a chapter at a time in a book that is
already published, we really don't have the mechanism in place for such
a thing...
