No, atomic_read() is cheap because it doesn't have to do a locked
operation.  However, operations like atomic_inc() that do need to do
something special are quite expensive.
For example, on x86, each atomic_inc()/atomic_dec() is the same cost
as a spin_lock(), since they all have to do some sort of "lock ; incX"
or "lock ; decX".  But then spin_unlock() is cheap, because it can do
a simple unlocked mov.
So in other words,
 	spin_lock_irqsave(&lock, flags);
 	++head1;
 	++head2;
 	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&lock, flags);
should be cheaper than
 	atomic_inc(&head1);
 	atomic_inc(&head2);
On the other hand, if you use the spinlock variant, then you do incur
an extra cost by requiring the lock for both reads and writes, instead
of the cheap atomic_read().
But complex use of atomic_t is very hard to get right, so it's usually
better to use a spinlock.
