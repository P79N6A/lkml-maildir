Greetings!  We run autofs 3.1.3 here to automount nfs volumes between
linux boxes all running 2.2.12.  Occasionally, a kernel nfs error will
occur which causes a mount of an autofs filesystem to shut down
incorrectly, with live mounts still running below it.  Needless to
say, the only way to recover is to shut down everything accessing any
automounted filesystem in the relevant tree, and restart autofs.  Here
are the syslogs:
Nov 16 12:55:10 intech5 automount[14885]: running expiration on path /mnt
Nov 16 12:55:10 intech5 automount[14885]: expired /mnt/d
Nov 16 12:58:10 intech5 automount[13009]: >> umount: /mnt/i19: device is busy
Nov 16 12:58:10 intech5 kernel: nfs: RPC call returned error 111 
Nov 16 12:58:10 intech5 kernel: RPC: task of released request still queued! 
Nov 16 12:58:10 intech5 kernel: RPC: (task is on xprt_pending) 
Nov 16 12:58:10 intech5 automount[13009]: spawnv Status is 256 
Nov 16 12:58:10 intech5 automount[13009]: shutting down, path = /mnt/i19
Process 13009 governing /mnt/i19 is now gone, with an NFS mount
remaining on /mnt/i19/d.  /proc/mounts still shows the mount at
/mnt/i19 as well, of course.
Any insights greatly appreciated!
