Well I'd rather it be called acting_capable() or self_acting_capable(),
but the realy issue is how to make that work through the security_ops()
layer without needless code duplication.  It'd be ideal if it's doable,
I agree.

Cool, thanks.  In the meantime, I guess your first patch is in
security-next anyway, right?
