From little bits of pizza left laying around.
Seriously, the use of any RS-232C bits for power is completely and totally
broken. In the old XT days a serial board containing two UARTs, plugged
into an 8-bit slot had lots of power available because DSR was just
connected to the 12-volt line. Further, the line-transceivers ran from
+/- 12 volts and were capable of driving a model railroad.
Then we got chips on the motherboard and low-power chips in laptops.
They all comply with the RS-232C standards but they don't drive
mice. Some almost do, depends upon how hungry the mouse is. This
is why mouse-ports (bus mice) were provided. One of the wires in
that cable is power.
So if somebody is designing a new device, as was the case that started
this thread, and they are using "power" from RS-232C, the design is
broken.
