Heh.  I know of a VFS.  Acorn had a Video FS in, um, 1985.  This is the
format the Domesday laserdiscs were written in.  And I should be reunited

I'm aware of three products called XFS, not three filesystems.  But it's
not a name, it's a macro which expands to a number, so it's merely a
political issue.
