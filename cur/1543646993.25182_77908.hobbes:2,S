Oh well, actually, I only made it possible to have multipart objects pull 
in objects from different dirs (but I still discourage that except for 
special cases), not for obj-y.
So you have to do sth like
obj-y += .. trampoline.o
trampoline-objs := ../kernel/trampoline.o
And you do not really want to do this, you rather want CONFIG_VOYAGER to 
define_bool CONFIG_X86_SMP y and be done without ugly hacks in the 
Makefiles.
