Is there a specific reason for this code?
arch/i386/kernel/ptrace.c:288-293 [kernel 2.2.13]
static int putreg(struct task_struct *child,
        unsigned long regno, unsigned long value)
{
        switch (regno >> 2) {
-->             case ORIG_EAX:
-->                     return -EIO;
It prevents me from using ptrace() to override a syscall :(
