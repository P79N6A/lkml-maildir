Hi,
In 2.6.15.1 I encountered some IDE crashes when unplugging IDE cables to
emulate disk errors. Below is a patch against 2.6.16 which I think still
applies.
1. The first BUG_ON could trigger when a PREFLUSH IO fails (it would fail
the original barrier request which hasn't been marked REQ_STARTED yet).
2. the rq could have been dequeued already (same as 1).
3. HWGROUP(drive)->rq could be NULL because of the ide_error() several lines
earlier.
