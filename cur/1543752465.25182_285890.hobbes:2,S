Can't agree more. I don't want to release my fuse-based SMB-connector (smb 
kioslave/gnome-vfs replacement :-) for exactly this reason - having released 
some projects earlier , I can't afford (in terms of time) to answer emails 
asking how to install fuse , where to grab it and which version, how to build 
etc, so I'm eagerly awaiting when fuse will be merged and I could point to 
kernel.org and required kernel version... 
Right now I think -mm tree will be a good starting point to instantly increase 
fuse testing base to iron out possible glitches and to ensure official 
acceptance.
