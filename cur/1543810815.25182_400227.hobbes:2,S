that sounds wrong; these ISOs are just there as well for download where
you downloaded the binary ones.

I doubt they do; you need the same subscription to get the binaries in
the first place, and when you get the binaries the sources are in the
same location. For all intents and purposes that is "sources come with
the binaries". If you select to be cheap and only download half, that's
your problem ;-)
In addition, Red Hat also publishes the src.rpms on their FTP site, even
though the GPL does not require them to do so. But just to be nice. 
I think you're talking out of the place the sun don't shine this time
sir ;-)
