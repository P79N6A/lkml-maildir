Good question.  There was a discussion thread where somebody pared down
the cc list (no LKML, no netdev, an apparently no Scott).  I saved most
of the messages, and can send them along to you if you want.
Anyway, in support of passing the NETIF_MSG_* msglevel as an arg to the 
netdev_* macros, I said that it...

In summary, the idea for netdev_fatal() is based on the idea that the msglevel
arg can not only be used for verbosity control, but can be logged as yet
another useful piece of info.  For printk-based logging, it could easily be
added to the message prefix:
	eth2: PROBE: Invalid Ethernet address
If you log this message using
	netdev_err(dev, PROBE, "Invalid Ethernet address\n")
it will be logged only if the PROBE flag is set in the msg_enable bitmap.
If you log it using
	netdev_fatal(dev, PROBE, "Invalid Ethernet address\n")
it will always be logged.
As mentioned above, I don't think the netdev_fatal idea is central to the
whole netdev_printk idea.
By the way, regarding using KERN_ERR vs. something stronger: It's pretty
unusual for a driver to log anything as KERN_CRIT or worse -- presumably
due to a desire not to overreact if the nth of n redundant devices happens
to fail.  So unless we can agree on a definition of KERN_CRIT (e.g., it
applies to any failure that makes a device unavailable pending human
intervention), I'd prefer to steer clear of that.
