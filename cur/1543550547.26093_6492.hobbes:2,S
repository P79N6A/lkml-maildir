I doubt that the full duplex fix itself caused the problem.  I think
this is probably another instance of the receive filter issue.  When
you bring up the Xircom card, if you don't get incoming traffic, try
doing things like "ifconfig eth0 promisc" (which should always work);
sometimes it is also enough to do "ifconfig eth0 -promisc" a few
times (which should do nothing, but...)
