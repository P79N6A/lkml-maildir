/proc/scsi/* is not standardized so even if you add a name no
userspace tool can sanely parse it without knowing all drivers.
sysfs OTOH can do this sanely.
So, no it does not make sense to add anything here for a 2.6 driver.

/proc/scsi/ will be optional and marked deprecated with with one of my
next patches and go away in 2.9.
