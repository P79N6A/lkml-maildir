So the Configure.help help text associated with this option is definitely 
unclear (I would say: misleading) because it barely says (in kernel 2.4.22):
<<<<<
Special FastTrak Feature
CONFIG_PDC202XX_FORCE
  For FastTrak enable overriding BIOS.
>>>>>
And I understood this as meaning <<enable the "FastTrak" RAID feature 
regardless of what BIOS says>>
Hmmmm...
