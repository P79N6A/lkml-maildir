The way I parsed it, either have..
 .name = "ADM1021-MAX1617 sensor",
 .name = "LM75 sensor",
or
 .name = "ADM1021-MAX1617",
 .name = "LM75",
ie, both, or all. Personally the latter looks better to me.
Especially given the 16 char limit.  Aren't these going to
be in a sysfs heirarchy where its obvious they are sensors
anyway ? like i2c/sensors/lm75 ?
