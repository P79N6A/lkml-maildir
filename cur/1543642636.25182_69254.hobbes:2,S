This argument assumes you have knowledge of the inner workings of this
step. To the best of my knowledge no one outside of Intel has cracked
open this chip and actually tested that this black box _does what it
says its doing_. This is what is meant by auditing.
Randomness tests like DIEHARD are absolutely useless for anything
other than telling you the spectral uniformity of a source, which is
no indication as to whether it's deterministic or not.

What right-thinking paranoid would place any faith in an analysis with
an Intel copyright? This is practically marketing fluff anyway.

But we can actually audit the former and decided whether to trust it.
For the Intel part, we only have faith. If you're one of the numerous
governments that's bought crypto solutions from respectable
corporations for your diplomatic communications that later turned out
to be backdoored, that faith doesn't have much currency. See Lotus
Notes and Crypto AG for two of the more notorious cases.
