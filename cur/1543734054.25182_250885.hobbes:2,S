heh :)
IMO the number of constraints involed here make using this patch fairly
involved (for something security related at least) in that, as you said,
you have to:
 - be careful to use ACCEPT rules only
 - be careful that you do:
    1. remove fw rules
    2. upgrade software
    3. replace rules
plus the fastpath code looks very hairy with at least 3 locks taken and
O(num_tasks * max_fds) unpreemptable in softirq...
There has to be a simpler approach, perhaps passing in a path, looking
up the dentry in current namespace and setting an unused flag in
d_vfs_flags? That way you could just match on skb->sk->sk_socket->file-
>f_dentry.
I don't know enough about VFS to know if that's really possible. I mean
would you need vfsmnt too to make it accurate across namespaces? and if
so, could dcookie infrastructure be used?
