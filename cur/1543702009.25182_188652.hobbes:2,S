Ok, I removed devfs support from the kernel, and installed udev on the 
machine.  I get the same error:
SCSI error : <0 0 0 0> return code = 0x70000
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 7552
Buffer I/O error on device sda, logical block 944
I migrated my laptop to use udev, also.  The USB stick still works 
perfectly on it.
Any other suggestions?
