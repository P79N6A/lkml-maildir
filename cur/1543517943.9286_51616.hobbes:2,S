And you'll carry that performance hit every time you make these changes.
How much of this should we carry?  Should Linux 3.4 still support the old
PCI interfaces?  If it did, it would be only to avoid losing some binary 
driver whose author/supplier was undoubtedly negligent.

You forget that:

Allowing for binary-only drivers is both a design decision and also a
necessity for those OSes.  With the exception of NT, Linux has a much
richer set of drivers available, too.
Stability is not the issue, though.  Show us some lmbench numbers for
Solaris/x86, or equivalent microbenchmarks for the others.  Linux does
better because it doesn't have to allow for every silly eventuality
when it can adapt to real requirements as they actually happen.

I'm afraid I don't believe that you can come up with a worthwhile example
of this ever having even nearly happened.
The Linux device driver interfaces (such as they are) are fairly stable
indeed.  The higher-level interfaces (for filesystems, for example) are
a lot more mobile, but this isn't your issue.
The fact is that stable kernels have a fairly static driver interface,
which is _almost always_ source-compatible, if not binary-compatible.
So there really is no disadvantage to driver writers who are willing to
contribute source, as far as I can see.
