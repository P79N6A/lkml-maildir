Personally, I think the Vortex is starving the whole PCI bus.

Nope, this is how the interrupt controller is mapped:
   0
   1
   2 <----------------  9
   3               |   10
   4               |   11
   5               |   12
   6                \  13
   7                 \ 14
                       15
The interrupts 9-15 are mapped through IRQ 2.  The history behind
this is the old Intel controllers.  For the PC/AT, a 2nd one was
added.  All current mainboard chipsets emulate this scheme.
I've had problems with any IDE-integrated chipsets and use of IRQs
14/15 regardless of their enabling/disabling on mainboard.  I sure
wish this wasn't such a production system or I'd give this a quick
"try."

I really have no idea what it is.
I have run into one other person complaining to "too lazy" dirty
buffer flushes with the 2.2.14 kernel.  I upgraded to the 2.2.14
kernel with numerous NFS patches to fix stability issues with my
Solaris clients.
Frankly, I didn't like the setup when I first got here.  I don't
like using Linux to serve out Solaris clients.  Linux, FreeBSD,
Irix, yes, Solaris, NO.  I have a bone to pick with the consultant
on the hardware selection too.
