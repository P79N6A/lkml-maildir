You should be able to spot the close in the signal queue by looking for
the POLLHUP --- it would be relatively simple to add a POLLHUP on local
socket close (you should already get one on remote close).  Without
that, the very worst that can happen is a wasted syscall as you read on
a file descriptor which isn't ready for read.

No, but there's one extra signal delivered.  You are just moving the
cost somewhere else, it's not really going to be significantly more
efficient than just doing the F_SETFAST poll return.
