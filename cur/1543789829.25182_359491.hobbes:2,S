Thomas,
I noticed you changed the names around for ktimer_start/restart.  Is it OK
to just use the restart, if you don't know if it has already started,
every time, and never call the start.  It seems to be OK now, but will
that ever change?
Basically, is just the ktimer_init good enough for ktimer_restart?
Thanks,
-- Steve
