How about a test comprising of lots of mail being
sent/rejected/bounced/deferred/etc.
Usually SMTPs like postfix store lots of directories and files in there.
And thus create lots of reads/writes. We could measure the efficiency of
that.
I think it is possible to DoS a system by thrashing its i/o by forcing the
smtp to do lots of work. With very poor io efficiency that is.
Propably reiserfs would have better results with such a test, whereas
ext3 could have better results on a differents test. (different
application)
I think the 'best result' fs will vary on the test.
Also i think it is better to testdrive the file systems using real
applications on high load.
