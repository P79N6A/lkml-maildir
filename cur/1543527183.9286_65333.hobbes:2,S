   Yes, that would work.

   The way I envisioned it, a disc-based /dev would have (for example)
   /dev/cpu being a symlink to $devfsroot/cpu
   Having two hierarchies encoded isn't good.
I'd much prefer the "/devfs" solution.  That means one symlink for folks
who want to use devfs, and one mountpoint for folks who don't.  
Compare this to how many symlinks we would need to put into /dev in the
non-devfs case, assuming that people start moving into kitchen sink into
devfs, and it's just not pretty.
