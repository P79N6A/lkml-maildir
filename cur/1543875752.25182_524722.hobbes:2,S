i can reproduce a crash on the second suspend-to-ram, on a T60. I get a 
crash here:
 #ifdef CONFIG_PM
 static void __pci_restore_msi_state(struct pci_dev *dev)
 {
         int pos;
         u16 control;
         struct msi_desc *entry;
         if (!dev->msi_enabled)
                 return;
         entry = get_irq_msi(dev->irq);
         pos = entry->msi_attrib.pos; <-------- crash on NULL dereference
i.e. 'entry' is NULL after get_irq_msi(). (i can see the crash only on 
the VGA screen so no dump of it available. Can write down more info if  
it's helpful.)
I have tried Eric's patch above but now i always get a hang after 
"system 00:00: resuming", already upon the first suspend-resume. Not 
even the NMI watchdog can get the system out of that hang.
