ok - no point to argue. just do something like asking for the default
parameters when starting the first time or place the values in variables
where everybody can find it, who knows how to handle "vi"....

but this is a bug and should be solved - right? there is another point:
if you move from a UP-kernel to SMP (or vice versa) then a "make mrproper"
is necessary! so you have to save the .config somewhere, make mrproper, 
execute something like make menuconfig (is there an non-interactive option
to go without this to process .config???) and start again...
