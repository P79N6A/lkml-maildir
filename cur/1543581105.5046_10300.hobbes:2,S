XFS uses both small metadata items in the buffer cache and large
pagebufs.  You may have merged a 512-byte read with a large pagebuf
read: one completion callback is associated with a single sg fragment,
the next callback belongs to a dozen different fragments.  Associating
the two lists becomes non-trivial, although it could be done.
