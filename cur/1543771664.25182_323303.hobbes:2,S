Good stuff :-)

hwmon wasn't near being added to -mm at the time so I went with the
status quo and named it i2c-sysfs, I'm all for renaming it to
hwmon-sysfs.h though.

I know the variable names are a bit long, but my patch against adm1026
for example still uses DEVICE_ATTR for attributes that can't make any
use of the dynamic callbacks, and hence I don't want to waste the
extra space required for a sensor device attribute. So there is still
reason to use both in one file. When it comes to macros that define
'hidden' variable names I'm inclined to err on the side of caution and
use the longer name too.
Thanks,
Yani
