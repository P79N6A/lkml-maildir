SLUB understands memory policies to apply to the pages from which
objects are acquired. MPOL_INTERLEAVE applies to the pages acquired
by the allocator not to individual objects acquired by the user of the
allocator from these pages.
With that point of view most of the memory policy handling can be pushed
into the page allocator.
