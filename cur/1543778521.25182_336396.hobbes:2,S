I got lots of "waah, why did you drop my patch" from people whose patches
had been merged by Linus.  Which is a bit odd given that those people were
previously cc'ed on the me->linus patch anyway.  Ho hum.  Adding a "why
this was dropped" to the email seemed too tricky.

OK.  I'm uploading the stripped series file at present (all the comments
are removed) because some versions of quilt don't like my new
comments-at-the-end-of-the-line feature.  That actually breaks some of my
stuff too, so I'll probably stop using it ;)

All done - let me know if it needs anything else.
