I have tried twice now to extract code from X and merge it into DRM.
It is a pointless endeavor. The driver code is so intertwined into the
X type system and other pieces of X it is hopeless to extract it.
You're better off just using it as a reference and writing the code
again. On the other hand code fron fbdev can be used with almost zero
change in DRM.
The radeon fbdev I2C driver code is based on the X version. But if you
compare the code it is a complete rewrite.
The big piece of fbdev code I need implements text drawing in graphics
mode. This is needed to print OOPs when they happen in a graphics
mode. I also need the fbdev drivers for which there is no
corresponding DRM equivalent. These drivers need to be converted to
use drm_core so that we have a unified driver model.
One end goal of all this is to end up with a single video mode setting
API for the kernel.
