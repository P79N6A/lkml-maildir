The standard need not. An implementation must deal
with whatever odd hardware happens to be in use.

Oh please. Normal: the stuff we have problems with.
I could as well have said "gcc just isn't correct on any
PC currently sold by eMachines, HP, or Dell".

Damn right. This is the C standard requirement.
Not all code has Linux-like performance requirements,
and in any case, standards are standards.
Don't like the standard? Don't claim to support it.
Maybe you could even propose some improvements
and get them voted into the standard for next time.

"memory", yes, not just the CPU's queue of writes
and/or pending reads. Not just the nearest bus.
If memory is out over the PCI bus, then it sure isn't
a simple matter to make the access occur. Tough luck.

Perhaps the wording of the standard should be changed.
Until then, the compilers are clearly not following the
requirements of the standard. (unless perhaps they
document a "do not map PCI or similar" restriction)

For certain values of "reasonable", yes.
