It's only _semantically_ equivalent (that is, it's the same from the
process's POV).  But it has two context switches which could have been
avoided, so its performance will _surely_ be worse.
And no, the kernel _will_ need to do more in the `kill()' case--- with
CLONE_SUSPEND, the complete work to create a new thread is like
	Original thread:
	- allocate new stack
	- new_tid = clone(...|CLONE_SUSPEND|...)
	- (update thread tables & related stuff)
	- sched_setscheduler(new_tid, ...)
	- kill(new_tid, SIGCONT)
	New thread:
	- just start running...
Total 3 syscalls, 1 context switch (on the `kill()').
If we use the trampoline approach, we get:
	Original thread:
	- allocate new stack
	- new_tid = clone(...)
	- waitpid(new_tid, WUNTRACED)
	- (update thread tables &c)
	- kill(new_tid, SIGCONT)
	New thread:
	- sched_setscheduler(new_tid, ...)
	- kill (new_tid, SIGSTOP)
A total of 5 syscalls, and 3 context switches.  (We'd get the same with
sigqueueinfo and sigwaitingo, BTW).
