Hi, 
do you mean "if you use BK you are agreeing that you won't work on another
SCM for 1 year after you stop using BK." for the kernel tree and developers or in general?
i think this statement is just a kind of trying the MicrosoftBeingTheOneAndOnly way.
it's a kind of extortion - use bk or die :/
if it is really being that way - say goodbye to bk as soon as possible.
