It merged totally automatically, no trouble what-so-ever:
	Renamed arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c => arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c
	Auto-merged arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c
	Renamed arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longhaul.c => arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longhaul.c
	Auto-merged arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/longhaul.c
	Auto-merged arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/cbe_cpufreq.c
	Merge made by recursive.
I think it was just unlucky that the particular version of git you have 
probably hit exactly in the window of "limited rename detection" *and* 
lacking the config switch to turn off the limiter.
