The only thing NO_IDLE_HZ=y "forces" on other users is some extra code 
(which you are going to get no matter what with CONFIG_PARAVIRT).   It 
doesn't force them to use this code.  It just provides a few extra 
routines that a paravirt_ops backend might want to call back into (I 
think both vmi and xen backends use these routines and that is why it 
became associated with CONFIG_PARAVIRT rather than CONFIG_VMI).
