This is insufficient. Many watchdog drivers are broken here but that's
no excuse to continue the problem because people will copy the errror
(as I suspect you did)
	fd = open("/dev/watchdog", O_RDWR);
	switch(fork())
	{

-ENOIOCTLCMD should never be returned to userspace. An unknown ioctl
returns -ENOTTY. -ENOIOCTLCMD is an internal magic value used with
helper layers to tell the helper layer "I don't handle this, use your
own handler"
