The slab functionality is designed to work on the processor with the 
queue. These tricks will only cause more trouble in the future. The 
cache_reaper needs to be either disabled or run on the right processor. It 
should never run on the wrong processor.
The cache_reaper() is of no importance to hotplug. You just need to make 
sure that it is not in the way (disable it and if its running wait 
until the cache_reaper has finished).
