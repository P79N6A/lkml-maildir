So the lames are nice 5 which means they should receive 75% of the cpu that 
nice 0 tasks receive so they should get 43% of the cpu...
Just a couple of questions;
The X/Gforce case; do they alternate cpu between them? By that I mean when 
they're the only thing running does the cpu load summate to 1 or does it 
summate to 2?
Gforce presumably is a 3d visualisation? Do you use one of the graphics card 
drivers listed that uses yield?
