Subject: Linux and Initrd used to access disk : how does it work ?

Hello,
I've been fighting for a few days with binary modules from some manufacturer
for hardware support of disk controler, and I'm at a point where I need
some more understanding.
1 - My machine contains an Adaptec SATA Raid based on Marvel 88SX60xx
    so I need to used the aar81xxx binary module,
2 - This module is presented as required to access the disk (when 
    installing a RH kernel, it says that no disk is present unless the
    module is loaded),
3 - When booting the kernel from disk after installation, the module is 
    loaded so the machine can access the disk...
... BUT ... how can the machine /
 - boot the kernel,
 - access the initrd image and uncompress it,
 - read the binary module inside and load it
BEFORE loading the module itself, if it is mandatory to access the disk.
And if it is not, then how can I do the installation ?
I suspect this should be fairly trivial, but I've been thinking about
for long, and it looks like chicken and egg to me...
Any help ?
Regards,
Paul
