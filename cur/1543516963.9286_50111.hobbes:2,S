	<sigh>  I knew I spoke too soon.
	I successfully built the kernel, but it broke on the modules. 
Specifically khttpd.
	I added a line to have it #define __KERNEL_SYSCALLS__ before
including <asm/unistd.h>.  To me, this seems very much line a hack, but I
admit I don't know too well how this stuff is supposed to work.
	Anyway, I made sure the entire kernel built this time (modules &
all), so this should be the last one.  As this fix is not alpha-specific,
I'm also sending it to the linux-kernel list.
Enjoy,
- Bob
