No one (who read the specs) ever though thought the write was "right
now," just that it was direct from user buffers. So it is not buffered,
but it is queued through the elevator.

Because it doesn't have terrible performance, because the user knows 
better than the o/s what it "right," etc. I used it to eliminate cache 
impact from large but non-essential operations, others use it on slow 
machines to avoid the CPU impact and bus bandwidth impact of extra copies.
Please don't assume that users are unable to understand how it works 
because you believe some other feature which does something else would 
be just as good. There is no other option which causes the writes to be 
queued right now and not use any cache, and that is sometimes just what 
you want.
I do like the patch to limit per-file and per-system cache, though, in 
some cases I really would like the system to slow gradually rather than 
fill 12GB of RAM with backlogged writes, then queue them and have other 
i/o crawl or stop.
