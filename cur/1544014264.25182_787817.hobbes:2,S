mn10300, frv and maybe h8300 are waiting for these patches to hit mainline
before they move their headers to arch/$ARCH/include
So sooner is better so we can get the rest fixed in this respect.
For m68k I have sent a patch to unify the headers for m68k and m68knommu
in arch/m68k/include/...
I really hope it is heading towards you soon.
