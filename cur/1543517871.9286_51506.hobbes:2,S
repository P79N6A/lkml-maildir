Hi,
  for some time I was seeing that I'm getting parts of files
overwritten by zeroes - last line overwritten with zeroes
in /etc/mtab, damaged just downloaded *.deb file and so on.
After some searching I found following code, which executes
on write() request.
  It looks to me like that if 
    block_end <= zerofrom || block_start >= zeroto
no-one marks buffer dirty... And because of default value
of 'zeroto' is zero, it is sometime trigerred.
  Because of this is important filesystem/buffer code and 
I'm not too familiar with it, there is no patch attached.
But quick fix looks like moving 'else' branch (marked
with /******/ by me in code below) into both code paths,
not only into full-write path.
  I'll do it and I'll see, it cannot be worse, I think.
  If I run testprogram, 'cat asd' then prints 'asdfghjk'.
If I do 'cat /600MBfile >/dev/null' after that, 'od -c' 
says
0000000   a   s   d   f  \0  \0  \0  \0
0000010
and it is wrong, isn't it?
  [I'm using IDE, if it matters, but I do not think...]
                                   Thanks for your time,
