Dear Experts,
NFS doesn't work with inotify (and it looks like it can't, certainly 
not before NFS v4.1).  However, if I give an NFS filename to 
inotify_add_watch(), I don't get an error.
If it indicated an error in this case then I could easily fall back to 
some sort of polling.  Without an error, I need some other way to 
detect NFS (and any other non-inotify-compatible filesystems).
Any thoughts?
Phil.
