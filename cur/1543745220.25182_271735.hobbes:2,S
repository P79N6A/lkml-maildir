Hi,
i experienced another one. But as i stayed on the console sysrq was
available, so i can send you the last locks listed by sysrq-t.
The scenario was this:
rtc_wakeup -f 8192 in one console
some find /'s in another
Now i changed to a third console and put some load on the system my doing
make clean bzImage in some kernel source dir.
right after hitting enter after typing "make clean bziage" i got another
piggy message and the machine locked. It seems (to my uneducated mind) cc1
and rtc_wakeup both are involved with this as the list of held locks (or the
part of the list which i can see) shows them.
there were 5 locks of the following form
&drive-gendev_rel_sem
init
init_hwif_data
2 locks of this form:
&tty->atomic_read
getty
reasd_char
and these:
&mm->page_table_lock
cc1
exit_mmap
&mm->mmap_sem
rtc_wakeup
do_page_fault
&mm->page_table_lock
rtc_wakeup
handle_mm_fault
&serio_lock
IRQ 1
serio_interrupt
sysrq_table_lock
IRQ 1
__handle_sysrq
