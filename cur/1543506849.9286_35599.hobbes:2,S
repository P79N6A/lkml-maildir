You are correct here.  The current system and functions are not perfect.

That is handled - dma_cache_inv is generally called before reading the
ring descriptors anyway.  There was, however, one instance in my patches
(which as far as I know is the only place where they are in existance
at the moment) which it wasn't handled correctly (tx_fill_ring).

AFAIK, you can't use (and shouldn't use) ioremap on the kernels image of
SDRAM.

This is actually an issue for the dma_cache_* functions.  For instance,
if the area the dma_cache_inv function is asked to invalidate is in
the moddle of a cache line, then you *must* write it back.  This means
that dma_cache_inv should be called even before the chip starts writing
to the space.

The idea of getting a space which is non-cacheable appears good, but
I think this may be done in one of two ways.  The first way would
be to have the SDRAM mapped in twice (bad, since you end up with two
large images of the same data).  Second way would be to remap SDRAM as
required.  I think this would be the cleaner solution, since you
could do something similar to vmalloc (but with kmalloc granularity).
(btw, do we need such a long CC: list?)
