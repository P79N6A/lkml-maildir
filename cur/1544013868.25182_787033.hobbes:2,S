Old kernel versions may still get booted after brtfs has gotten a
reputation for stability.  E.g. if I move my / to brtfs in 2.6.34, then
one day need to boot back to 2.6.30 to track down some regression, the
reminder that I'm moving back to some sort of brtfs dark-ages might be
welcome.
(Not that I have particularly strong feelings about this.)
