In drivers/net/bnx2.c:1285: it reads in function bnx2_setup_remote_phy():
if (pause_adv & (ADVERTISE_1000XPSE_ASYM | ADVERTISE_1000XPSE_ASYM))
Note that the two are the same and this is therefore equivalent to
if (pause_adv & ADVERTISE_1000XPSE_ASYM)
This appears to be incorrect, was maybe '| ADVERTISE_1000XPAUSE' intended?
