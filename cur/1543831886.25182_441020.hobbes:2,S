You are inhumane. :-) What is incorrect in assuming people may have many
devices?

No. User thread will not write _all_ dirty pages (if it does---it's a
bug in the current code and should be fixed):
balance_dirty_pages():
			if (pages_written >= write_chunk)
				break;		/* We've done our duty */
writeback_inodes():
		if (wbc->nr_to_write <= 0)
			break;
sync_sb_inodes():
		if (wbc->nr_to_write <= 0)
			break;
mpage_writepages():
			if (ret || (--(wbc->nr_to_write) <= 0))
				done = 1;
Everywhere down call-chain ->nr_to_write is checked.
