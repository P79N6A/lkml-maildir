If you have other parts of the system which run with IRQs disabled for
a significant time period, then you will get serial corruption.  That's
not the serial driver's fault - that's a problem with the other device
drivers/rest of the system.
You may be table to track down where IRQs are being held off for too long
by hooking into the 8250 interrupt handler, and when an overrun error is
reported, printk a _minimal_ message reporting the instruction pointer
obtained via get_irq_regs().
Note, however, that I don't actively maintain serial anymore.
