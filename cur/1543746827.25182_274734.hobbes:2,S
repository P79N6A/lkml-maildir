Rest of kernel is pretty happy with /proc as-is. Why can't suspend2
just play along?
How many options are really neccessary? activate is not. selecting of
reboot can already be done in /sys. Some percentages? There really
should not be 20 things to configure.

Kernel boot is not expected to be interactive. I'd do
if (can_erase_image)
	printk("Incorrect kernel version, image killed\n");
else
	panic("Can't kill suspended image");
