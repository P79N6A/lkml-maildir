Indeed, right. Ok, no real objections on the patch.

Ok, sorry,  wrong here. I remembered doing the thing but it was for other 
reasons - reducing spinlock hold times. Doing syscalls under spinlocks is 
just (possibly) slow, not wrong. But ok, the commendment was "thou shalt not 
optimize".

I thought mainly to unregister_winch(); the lock in winch_cleanup() has been 
added now, I didn't see it.

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
