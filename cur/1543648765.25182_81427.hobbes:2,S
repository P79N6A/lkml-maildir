ptrace() is ok, but it also has lots of disadvantages: performance,
expressiveness, security, assurance.  I've posted before on this mailing
list, at length, about them.  In short, ptrace() is not an ideal solution,
and a secure chroot() or other way to construct a jail/sandbox would
be better.  (LSM will be much better.)
