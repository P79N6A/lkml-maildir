Greetings,
I'd like to better understand the possible causes of a kernel divide error
as indicated by the do_divide_error() routine (expanded from the
DO_VM86_ERROR macro).  I'm unfamiliar with the internals of the x86
processor (and thus I am lost when I hit the assembly) but it is clear this
is some kind of math exception happening within the kernel.  Is it
reasonable to attribute this trap to faulty hardware, or should I look
elsewhere?  The kernel is 2.0.33, btw.
thanks,
-bp
