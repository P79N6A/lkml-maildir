Still not convinced, i still want to know which interrupt rate and how 
many processors. Are the following functions really protected from say 
NMIs at 300,000/s? request_nmi actually looks dodgiest.
static void free_nmi_handler(void *arg)
{
	struct nmi_handler *handler = arg;
	INIT_LIST_HEAD(&(handler->link));
	complete(&(handler->complete));
}
void release_nmi(struct nmi_handler *handler)
{
	spin_lock(&nmi_handler_lock);
	list_del_rcu(&(handler->link));
	init_completion(&(handler->complete));
	call_rcu(&(handler->rcu), free_nmi_handler, handler);
	spin_unlock(&nmi_handler_lock);
}
