If you run kernels from the developers, you have joined the linux
development test team... whether you know it or not.  The bug reports
coming in are the main output of the test team. Positive reports are
nice but contain relatively little information for developers. You may
get productive use, and that is nice, but it is not the primary
purpose of the test team.
