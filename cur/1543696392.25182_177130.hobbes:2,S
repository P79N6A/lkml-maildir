I think I first bumped that to 16k, that was needed on a 32way box.
At 128way my gut feeling is its 32k.
Linking the number of proc entries to the number of cpus is a bit crude
but its better than having it fixed.
FYI I think some networking people were complaining about this limit
when they create gobs of network interfaces (dummy devices?  ipsec?).
Each interface creates a bunch of /proc/sys/net entries...
