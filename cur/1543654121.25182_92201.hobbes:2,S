But can't we still just use the structure from the kernel header and not
have to retype it here?  If needed, we can change the type of
driver_info into something more portable than what it is today.  That
would be much easier in the long run.

Ah, you never told me about this plan :)
Yes, that would be very nice to have, pushing the logic out of the
/sbin/hotplug code and into modprobe doesn't bother me.  That just saved
a _whole_ bunch of space in diethotplug, so you've made up for making
the size smaller.
How would modprobe know which driver to load based on the above line?
Are you going to scan all module files, or rely on something like the
modules.*map files of today?

I don't know, I haven't looked into that.  Just realize that if you
pre-process the information like you are proposing to do, you can't get
it back later, which changes the way things work.
