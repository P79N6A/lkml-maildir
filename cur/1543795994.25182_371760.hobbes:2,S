I'd also be interested in your responses to the comparison I wrote up last week.

Which as I pointed out would be a rather minor patch to mine.  There's a
bit of code to manage the board-specific SPI tables, which _can't_ be
a module.  Then there's something less than 2KB of code (ARM .text) that
could live in a module.  I can't get excited about making that live in
a module, but I'd take a patch to change that.

Which as I pointed out is incorrect.  The core API (async) has always
been fully DMA-safe.  And a **LOT** lower overhead than yours, which
allocates buffers behind the back of drivers, and encourages lots of
memcpy rather than just doing DMA directly to/from the buffers that
are provided by the SPI protocol drivers.

You'd have to explain what you mean by all of these.  I could guess
based on what you've said before (disagree!), but that won't help.

Whereas in my previous comments about your framework, I think I've
pointed out that imposing needless and restrictive policies on how
the controller drivers work is a Bad Thing.
