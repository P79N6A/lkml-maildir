It is usually caused by USB Legacy emulation - BIOS makes a USB mouse look
like a PS/2 mouse. Look in your BIOS setup if there is an option to turn it
off. Otherwise you will have to load ehci/uhci_hcd and hid modules before
loading psmouse module as loading full-blown USB support disables that
emulation.
