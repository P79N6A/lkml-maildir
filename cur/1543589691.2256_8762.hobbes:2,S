Hi,
     The question may sound very stupid... But I have following doubt.
suppose I am making some change in sched.c and now I want to build my kernel
that reflects the change..
Is there any way I can avoid answering all the questions when I do make zImage ?
In short how should I compile the kernel (in very small time) to see my changes.
Thanks (for not flaming me)
Amol
