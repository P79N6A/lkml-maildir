initrd is basically a ramdisk image loaded by the bios before control
is transferred from the loader to the kernel. Thus you can have a floppy
with a file system, lilo and a kernel on it (if you squeeze).
Then you can set it up so that
The boot loads the initd
It runs the needed USB drivers
It  mounts the /dev/sda disk and copies it to /dev/ram1 ramdisk
It transfers control
