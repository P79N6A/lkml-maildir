i had similar problems with Fujitsu drives; they appeared to be
because of overclocking: when base freq. is set to 83 MHz, (some)
Fujitsu HDDs do not work in UDMA mode. They work if either
* the computer is not overclocked (66 MHz; i did not try 75 MHz after
  a crash ;); in this case UDMA works fine
or
* the computer is overclocked (75 MHz or 83 MHz), but you are not
  using UDMA.
Please, let me know if your problems were due to overclocking, too. :)
