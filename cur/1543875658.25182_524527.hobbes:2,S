Yes, may be.

Ok, let's make things a little bit clear. I need to put somehow 3 short
values (torques -- to tell 3 motors how much to spin around) into the kernel
space via ff layer. I computed them using FP in US from forces (3d vector)
and the problem is, that I don't know how to transform torques to plane(s)
and dir and then back to torques -- this is what I can't figure out, since I
have no longer vector -- 3 values for each axis, which says how big is the
force in each axis -- but I have values (no axis) specific to each motor.
thanks for notes,
