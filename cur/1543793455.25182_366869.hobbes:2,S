Hmm... Not sure if this is mis-calibration or just bad-interaction w/
kthrt. Mind sending a dmesg to me?

Do the TOD patches have this issue by themselves, or is this only with
kthrt? I know I had some issues with non-continuous clocksources (pit,
jiffies) with the kthrt patch, where it wouldn't fall back to
non-high-res when the clocksource stopped supporting it.
