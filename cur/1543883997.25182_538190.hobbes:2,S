        Well, this is one of those hard questions... Fortunately,
people who worked on this and were Compaq employees are reachable, so
I contacted Jamie Hicks, who is one of the authors of iPaq ports,
regarding solution for this. Jamie, would it be possible to leave
Compaq and other copyright notices, and Compaq disclaimer intact,
but replace following paragraph:
> + * Use consistent with the GNU GPL is permitted,

        With more common wording as appears in kernel sources:

(or GPL2 wording, or verbose wording, whatever you see fit)
Thanks!
