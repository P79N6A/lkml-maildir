Yet Another IO-APIC problem.  From what I see quoted above, it has 
nothing at all to do with the via-rhine, and everything to do with IO-APIC.
Almost universally, in 2.4 and 2.5, running IO-APIC on uniprocessor is 
badly broken, and causes all sorts of bogus bug reports for unrelated 
subsystems.  Sometimes IO-APIC is busted even on SMP.
Workaround solutions:  (1) boot with "noapic" on command line, (2) 
disable IO-APIC in kernel config (if uniprocessor), and/or (3) make sure 
that "MP 1.1" is listed in BIOS setup instead of "MP 1.4".
Man, this must be the fourth or fifth bug report I've gotten in the past 
week or so, where the IO-APIC can be blamed.  ;-(  In all recent cases 
it has been uniprocessor IOAPIC, not SMP IOAPIC, that was problematic. 
IMO we should just take out UP IOAPIC support in the kernel, or put a 
big fat warning in the kernel config _and_ at boot...
