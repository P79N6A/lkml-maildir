Yeah, understood, and already seen as the solution.
I guess I just wanted to try and prevent breakage to _existing_
projects, and the need for another hack to try and figure out
how to build for 2.6 (2.6 has been a bumpy ride in external
module building regards =).
But I guess it will not happen, so rather now then much later
when 2.6 is in much wider use ... :-)
Thanks,
