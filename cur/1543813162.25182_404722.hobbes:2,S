Sure, but because of the partitioned caches on some systems, the
second load can get older data than the first load, even though it
issues later.
If you do:
	CPU 0			CPU 1
	foo = val;
	wmb();
	p = &foo;
				reg = p;
				bar = *reg;
it is apparently possible for CPU 1 to see the new value of p
(i.e. &foo) but an old value of foo (i.e. not val).  This can happen
if p and foo are in different halves of the cache on CPU 1, and there
are a lot of updates coming in for the half containing foo but the
half containing p is quiet.
I added Paul McKenney to the cc list so he can correct anything I have
wrong here.
Paul.
