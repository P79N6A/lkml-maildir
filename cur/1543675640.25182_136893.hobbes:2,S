hm, i guessed this was an important thing "in the old days" (TM),
i never had problems when "hotplugging" ps/2. nevertheless - i _have_ to
unplug/replug the ps/2 keyboard to actually _use_ it. after this is done
the keyboard is working right (and the mainboard, too :-))
thank you all for your comments; i only wished
- someone else has these problems too
- one could tell what to try to get error messages or so (usb debugging
and input debugging is available!)
- is it fixable at all? with 2.4.20-rc2 this was is not happening...
Thanks again,
Christian.
