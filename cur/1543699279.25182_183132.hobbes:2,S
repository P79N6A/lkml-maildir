Hi Russell,
How is the following patch? It moves the complete() call in the "pccardd" 
thread after class_device_register(), so that in init_i82365() when
pcmcia_register_socket() is done we are sure that class device is 
registered before creating the attribute files.
I must be missing lots of things as I could not understand the interaction
you mentioned, but still after seeing the code I did this patch. 
IMHO we should propogate the error code if returned by class_device_register(), 
back to pcmcia_register_socket() so that in case of error we can fail the 
pcmcia_registera_socket(). For this purpose, I used socket->driver_data() in
pccardd() and also checking it in pcmcia_register_socket(). 
Thanks
Maneesh
o pcmcia_register_socket() should be woken up only after registering the
  class device so that it doesnot create attribute files before registering
  the class device.
o The error, if returned from class_device_register() is propogated back
  to pcmcia_register_socket() using the ->driver_data field in the
  pcmcia_socket. pcmcia_register_socket() is failed if socket->driver_data
  has error in it, so that the driver init routine can process the failuer
  properly.
