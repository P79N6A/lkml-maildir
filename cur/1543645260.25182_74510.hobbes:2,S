It certainly looks like it.  gcc 3.0.3 appears to ignore
"-iwithprefix include", where as gcc 2.95.x, 2.96, 3.1 and 3.2 all
work as expected.
-iwithprefix is supposed to add /usr/lib/gcc-lib/<target>/<version>/include
to the compilers include path.
For curiositys sake, what does:
  gcc -print-file-name=include
give you?  That should (in theory) be the same path as -iwithprefix include
but iirc this method apparantly breaks with internationalisation
(discovered in 2.4.)  I'm going to place my bets on:
  /usr/sbin/../../lib/gcc-lib/i686-pc-linux-gnu/3.0.3/include
though, which would be wrong.
