I did indeed have an older version of the patches (before you split them 
out) and that was missing the "const" in the first quoted line, so that 
explains the warning I had.
If I compare the version I've been running with the past months and this 
series I see only minor changes and I don't expect any problems from 
them. If I notice anything I'll let you know. No news is good news :-)
Thanks,
