I was expecting to see this sometime in 2.5, not quite so soon...
The key idea here is to disable preemption on spin lock and reenable on
spin unlock.  That's a practical idea, highly compatible with the
current way of doing things.  Its a fairly heavy hit on spinlock
performance, but maybe the overall performance hit is small.  Benchmarks
are needed.
A more ambitious way to proceed is to change spinlocks so they can sleep
(not in interrupts of course).  There would not be any extra overhead
for this on spin_lock (because the sleep test is handled off the fast
path) but spin_unlock gets a little slower - it has to test and jump on
a flag if there are sleepers.
