set_num_colors() needs to go downstairs under arch/ Some of the
current->pid checks look a bit odd esp. for GFP_ATOMIC and/or
in_interrupt() cases. I'm not sure why this is a config option; it
should be mandatory. I also wonder about the interaction of this with
the per-cpu lists. This may really want to be something like a matrix
with (cpu, color) indices to find the right list; trouble is, there's a
high potential for many pages to be trapped there. mapnr's (page -
zone->zone_mem_map etc.) are being used for pfn's; this may raise
issues if zones' required alignments aren't num_colors*PAGE_SIZE or
larger. proc_misc.c can be used instead of page_color_init(). ->free_list
can be removed. get_rand() needs locking, per-zone state. Useful stuff.
