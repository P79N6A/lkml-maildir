Yes. Your initial console can be NULL, set as a kernel command-line
parameter. You should really be using an initial RAM disk (initrd).
That gets mounted for boot, containing whatever is necessary to
properly start the system, then change to the file root (or not).
This is how hundreds of different embeded systems are started.
Execute-in-place, which I think you are trying with 'cpio' will
continue to give you problems because you can't test it except
by throwing it off-the-cliff to see if it flies. RAM-disk systems
can be tested, booting on any media (even a floppy).
