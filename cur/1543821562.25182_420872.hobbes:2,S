you are right, but in this particular case this doesnt seem to be 
'wrong' unwind data, it's more of a special marker of the end of the 
frame (if i understood it correctly). If it's wrong unwind data then 
that data should be fixed.
I also agree with adding a limit to catch buggy cases of recursion, as a 
separate mechanism, independently of this particular bug.
