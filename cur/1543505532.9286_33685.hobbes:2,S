Does anybody has some code, even in a "concept" stage, which would load
ramdisk images, while booting, from files on CD instead of a raw floppy?
I am thinking about it now mostly on Alpha where this should be easier
as both milo and aboot have some idea about underlying file systems;
but I would not complain about more general solutions. :-)  Creating
some kind of a catalogue, like on "El Torito" bootable CDs, does not
seem to outlandish.
