Hello all,
I have a program which relies on being able to derive the address of a SIGSEGV.  To do that, I use the SA_SIGINFO option to sigaction() and read out the faulting address from the si_addr parameter of the siginfo structure (second argument.)  I also check si_code for SEGV_ACCERR.
Under 2.4 kernels, this works great.  However, under 2.2.17pre15 (I downgraded because of stability problems) and glibc 2.1.2, si_code and si_addr are both 0.  Is this simply unimplemented in 2.2 kernels, or is this a bug?
