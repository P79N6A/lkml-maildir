Just browsed across the white paper, but this doesn't make a lot of
sense to me.
1. Instead of cryptographic filesystems, you could just encrypt the
   block device.
2. The only reason not to do so it security.  An attacker could use
   known-plaintext attacks, since some parts of the metadata can be
   reconstructed or guessed easily.
3. Instead of encrypted swap, you could just encrypt the block device.
4. The only reason reason not to do so is what?
Sorry, beats me, I cannot see any reason. Is there a possible
known-plaintext attack possible, that is not obvious to everyone, at
least not to me?
