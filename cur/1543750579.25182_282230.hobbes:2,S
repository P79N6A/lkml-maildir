I quite like how you're handling the page zeroing now. It seems
less intrusive and cleaner in its interface to the page allocator
now.
I think this is pretty close to what I'd be happy with if we decide
to go with zeroing.
Just one small comment - there is a patch in the -mm tree that may
be of use to you; mm-keep-count-of-free-areas.patch is used later
by kswapd to handle and account higher order free areas properly.
You may be able to use it to better implement triggers/watermarks
for the scrub daemon.

Would you be better off to just have a driver->zero_me(...) call, with this
logic pushed into those like your BTE which need it? I'm thinking this would
help flexibility if you had say a BTE-thingy that did an interrupt on
completion, or if it was done synchronously by the CPU with cache bypassing
stores.
Also, would there be any use in passing a batch of pages to the zeroing driver?
That may improve performance on some implementations, but could also cut down
the inefficiency in your timeout mechanism due to timer quantization (I guess
probably not much if you are only zeroing quite large areas).
BTW, that while loop is basically a busy-wait. Not a critical problem, but you
may want to renice scrubd to the lowest scheduling priority to be a bit nicer?
(I think you'd want to do that anyway). And put a cpu_relax() call in there?
Just some suggestions.
