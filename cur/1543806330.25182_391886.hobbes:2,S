Actually, plain 2.6.15 already has this (for i386 and x86-64 at least). Hence the first of the two hunks the patch
consists of is superfluous. The second hunk, however, is still necessary (as there's no pre-existing
touch_nmi_watchdog() call there, and there also shouldn't be one as interrupts get re-enabled before getting there).
