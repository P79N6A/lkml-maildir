I have had much better luck talking to /dev/console in userland.
IMNSHO this should *always* work; anything else is broken.
/dev/console currently *IS* broken to some degree, multi-console
hasn't worked properly for a long time, and you don't get job control
running of it because it isn't a tty, but I think it's a lot less
broken than things like the above...
(And dammit, I really would like to see console=tty0 console=ttyS0 to
actually give me both consoles -- in userland *and* in the kernel...)
