*users* have no business changing the system configuration. End of story.
Again, if somebody doesn't read manpages before doing stuff under root -
no point trying to protect him. He will find a way to fsck up, no matter
how many "safety" checks you put in. BTW, that's the first time I've seen
"elite" used as a term for "able to understand the meaning of words 'use
with extreme caution'". Oh, well...
