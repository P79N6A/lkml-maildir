We've established no such thing. In fact, you can't properly initialize
SDRAM memory without writing something to it. Further, reading SDRAM
after a power-on or a reset, will result in all 1s (0xffffffff) because
the SDRAM controller isn't even connected to the RAM. Further, in the
process of connecting it up (logically), the lowest 15 bits of all
SDRAM commands will end up being written to every chip. With SDRAM,
data are normally clocked in/out, once the precharge command is
executed, it's not even clocked. It works like this:
(1) Put a memory controller command in a controller register.
(2) Attempt to write RAM (anywhere), that makes the controller read
    and acccept the command.
(3) Continue with all commands. The last enables refresh.

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
