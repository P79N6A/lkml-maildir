Actually, I just solved an i845 issue here.  I have a patch that should 
enable yours to work I think.  It's against the i810_audio.c driver in 
Alan's current tree.  I've attached that patch.  If the patch doesn't work 
for you, the complete source code can be found at 
http://people.redhat.com/dledford/i810_audio.c.gz
 (shift-click on the link 
in a browser to get it to download the file cleanly).  Drop that source in 
place and use it to test.
