xntp includes ntpdate, which is similar to date but uses xntp servers.
When I was dialup, I used ntpdate to resync my clock with a cron job
and I got a good compromise of accurate time (including rate) and low
re-dial rates. Twice a day may well be enough to keep pretty good time.
BTW this is on an alpha.
