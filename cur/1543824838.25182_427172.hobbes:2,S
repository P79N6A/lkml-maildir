You replace what's running on the physical machine.
You can chose to kexec into a new "regular" Linux kernel (Xen goes
away), or kexec into a new Xen hypervisor with a new dom0 kernel (Xen
is replaced). Kexec behaves exactly the same as Linux today - no
patches are needed to kexec-tools.
Kdump is a little different though, we reserve the physical ram range
in the hypervisor and our hypervisor code is currently using a
differen format for the command line options. With Kdump under Xen it
is possible to take a memory snapshot of the entire machine - both the
hypervisor and dom0.
