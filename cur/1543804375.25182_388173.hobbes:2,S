Subject: [ANNOUNCE][RFC] PlugSched-6.2 for  2.6.16-rc1 and 2.6.16-rc1-mm1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This version continues the major gutting of the SPA based schedulers to
reduce overhead.  The inclusion of the mechanisms for gathering and
displaying accrued scheduling statistics have been remove as they are 
not an integral part of the scheduler and were mainly there to help with 
tuning.  Sorry Jake, if you still need these for your genetic algorithm 
work I can provide a patch to add them to all schedulers?
Additionally, the mechanism for auto detection and preferential
treatment of media streamers in the spa_ws scheduler has been removed. 
The reason for this is that my testing shows that the performance of 
media streamers on spa_ws is adequate without it.
Modifications have been made to spa_ws to (hopefully) address the issues 
raised by Paolo Ornati recently and a new entitlement based 
interpretation of "nice" scheduler, spa_ebs, which is a cut down version 
of the Zaphod schedulers "eb" mode has been added as this mode of Zaphod 
performed will for Paolo's problem when he tried it at my request. 
Paolo, could you please give these a test drive on your problem?

Very Brief Documentation:
You can select a default scheduler at kernel build time.  If you wish to
boot with a scheduler other than the default it can be selected at boot
time by adding:
cpusched=<scheduler>
to the boot command line where <scheduler> is one of: ingosched,
nicksched, staircase, spa_no_frills, spa_ws, spa_svr, spa_ebs or zaphod. 
  If you don't change the default when you build the kernel the default 
scheduler will be ingosched (which is the normal scheduler).
The scheduler in force on a running system can be determined by the
contents of:
/proc/scheduler
Control parameters for the scheduler can be read/set via files in:
/sys/cpusched/<scheduler>/
