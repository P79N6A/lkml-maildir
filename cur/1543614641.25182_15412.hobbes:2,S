Subject: nfs + ipv6 hanging???

Kernel 2.4.17, gcc-2.95.4, mount 2.11n
nfs clients seem to hang when ipv6 is on the machine.  No idea why...
the mount process gets stuck in 'D' state and the only way out is to
reboot.
If I remove ipv6 from the box & perform exactly the same operations then 
it works perfectly.  The mount is definately using the ipv4 address (I 
don't think the portmapper/nfsd is ipv6 enabled anyway).
