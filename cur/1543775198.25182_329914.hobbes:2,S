No, it doesn't. The warnings are about /function pointers/ that have the
wrong type (this comes from an earlier 2.6.12-git). AFAICS, this is due to
a change in device handling, and as long as this isn't fixed, I won't even
try to load the module.
Just need a little time to decrypt this macro mess...
And again, shouldn't we push for the header here going into the kernel? Or
fix up the code to work with the kernel version? The current situation
isn't confortable at all.
