There is a routine in the IDE code to decrease transfer speed in case of
these problems. And it is there for a good reason - many (namely UDMA66)
mainboards have incorrectly wired IDE traces and can never achieve full
UDMA speeds, and there is no way to know.
For that I've also created UDMA_SLOW, which is even slower than UDMA_0
(16.6 MB/sec), which still has CRC protection, and needs even less
physical bandwidth than PIO4.
