This patch contains Alan's patch for fixing the compilation of 
drivers/char/mwave/mwavedd.c, but the driver is still marked as BROKEN 
which should now be undone.
The MWAVE also got a comment
  # PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS - move this driver to drivers/serial
Since it seems this code is mostly unmaintained, can the
  mv drivers/char/mwave drivers/serial/
be done in the git-serial tree?
Additionally, drivers/char/mwave/mwavedd.c now requires an
  #include "8250.h"
for the serial8250_{,un}register_port prototypes.
TIA
Adrian
