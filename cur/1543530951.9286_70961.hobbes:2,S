ide-geometry.o (always compiled in the kernel) needs current_capacity() and
get_info_ptr(), which are defined in ide.c.
However, if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=m and CONFIG_IDE=y, ide.o is compiled as a
module causing a kernel link failure.

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
