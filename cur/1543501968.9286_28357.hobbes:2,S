My point about Sangoma was that there are multiple versions of the driver
out that are not stable (your posts were the ones I was referring to on
this topic.....)  For a manufacturer of products used in mission-critical
router applications, it's not a good situation to be in.  I'm not trying
to bash Sangoma--they have their reasons for doing what they do, I'm sure.
We have the resources in-house to handle the development of the drivers,
and we do it to some exacting QA standards.
That said, let's take 4 Front Technologies as the example. 
The Open Sound System project, structured even more tightly than our SDL
driver project, has flourished using a similar model.  My point wasn't to
bash anyone, just to make a pre-emptive strike against those who would
argue against a limited open-source project.
Regards,
Doug
