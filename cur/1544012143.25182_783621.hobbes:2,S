Subject: [PATCH 1/2] ring-buffer: fix dangling commit race
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/23/114

From: Steven Rostedt <srostedt@redhat.com>
Impact: fix to stuck buffers
If an interrupt comes in during the rb_set_commit_to_write and
pushes the tail page forward just at the right time, the commit
updates will miss the adding of the interrupt data. This will
cause the commit pointer to cease from moving forward.
Thanks to Jiaying Zhang for finding this race.
