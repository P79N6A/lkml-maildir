Compare the release dates. If you see the latest 2.6.23.y released a week
ago and nothing equivalent for 2.6.22.y, chances are that there will not
be newer ones. Also, Greg announces his intentions to stop in each announce.
Last he stated that 2.6.22.17 (and finally 18) was most likely the last one.
