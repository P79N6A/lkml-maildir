FWIW, I tried the hardware usage bonus thing, and it does cure the X 
inversion problem (yeah,  it's a pretty cheezy way to do it).  It also 
cures xmms skips if you can't get to the top without hw usage.  I also 
tried a cpu limited backboost from/to tasks associated with hardware, and 
it hasn't run amok... yet ;-)
