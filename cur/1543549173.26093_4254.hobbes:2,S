Subject: News gateway not working
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/9/19/20

I didn't want to post to the list with this, but postmaster@vger.kernel.org
didn't get a reply.
The NNTP gateway hasn't been working for two weeks-- the last list message
was 9/2/2000. Maybe this is common knowledge on the list (since I'm not
subscribed, I obviously wouldn't know...) but it's a little discouraging to
get absolute silence on fa.linux.kernel. If the problem is known, then
someone should post directly to the newsgroup and let us know when it might
be fixed. I know there were some massive changes when the list switched to
new servers, and hopefully that's the reason and it can be fixed soon.
For many people, the newsgroup is a much easier way to read the list, and
furthermore it reduces the load on vger, because otherwise we'd have to
subscribe. So please...look kindly on us.
