It is, in a way.  But, it keeps the bind mounting process itself a much
simpler operation in the kernel.  The --bind operation itself stays just
a matter of copying a vfsmount.  Otherwise, you end up trying to manage
a bunch of state transitions if, for instance, the source vfsmount is
r/w and the bind is requested to be r/o.
Plus, the previous behavior was only established by the original
out-of-tree patches from vserver.  Herbert, this doesn't cause you too
much of a headache, right?

Mostly for vserver, for now.  They allow a filesystem to be r/w, but
have r/o views into it.  This is really handy so that every vserver can
use a common install but still allow the administrator to update it.
