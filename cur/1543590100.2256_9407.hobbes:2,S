Hm. I think the access patterns between boot-up and fsck are quite
different. An fsck has to seek to a large number of tracks. During
bootup, I think the number of tracks accessed is much lower, and there
is probably more data locality as well. Still, only one way to be
sure.
I haven't had time to look closely at this, but one thing that bothers
me is how to find out what is being accessed in the first place. A
C-library wrapper to intercept read(2) calls isn't any good, because a
lot of stuff is memory-mapped (in particular shared libraries). Anyone
have a clean way to do this?
