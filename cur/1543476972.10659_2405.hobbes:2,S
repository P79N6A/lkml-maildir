Yo, Mr. Scherrey.  Don't tell us -- show us.  Grab a tarball, build
it with your choice of C++ compiler, find some place where C++
solves a problem, and come back with a demo.
It doesn't have to be a ready-to-integrate polished patch.  It just
has to show people that it solves some problem somehow.
