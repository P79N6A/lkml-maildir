Well, I did some additional debugging on that, working on git version
3bf75f9b90c981f18f27a0d35a44f488ab68c8ea:
In snd_pcm_oss_release() I added 
snd_assert(substream != NULL, return -ENXIO); 
in front of the first access to substream->pcm, which leads to
Apr  5 02:13:13 knautsch kernel: [17180638.784000] BUG? (substream != ((void *)0))
when opening /dev/dsp for write.
If I now add the patch you suggested, correcting the check in
snd_pcm_oss_open_file(), accessing /dev/dsp instead leads to EINVAL.
So I guess git bisect really lead me to this already known bug.
