It's vfat.

No, there's no mounting going on at that time.  Just unmounting.

Okay, so it looks like a bug in fat/vfat?  Wouldn't surprise me ;-)  And
since it happens at umount time, the case where "the filesystem
continues to use old-sized buffers for some time" shouldn't apply-- the
filesystem gets disused right away.  So I'm probably not in any real
trouble.  (I do have backups, anyway.)
[patch snipped]
All right, I shall apply this patch and report any new information.
Thanks very much!
