As discussed personally and on the list a strong NACK for this.  Swapcache
pages have no business at all ever coming through ->writepage(s).  If you
really want to support swap over NFS that can only be done properly by
adding separate methods to write out and read in pages separated from the
pagecache.  Incidentally that would also clean up the mess we have with
swap files on "normal" filesystems using ->bmap and bypassing the filesystem
later on.
