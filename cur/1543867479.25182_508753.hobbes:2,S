I don't, and my 3dnow capable C3s are unplugged right now.
The newer generation (including the C7) have SSE/SSE2 instead,
which seems to be faster.  (Using a different benchmark app that uses SSE)
clear_page function 'normal clear_page()'        took 9425 cycles per page (620.3 MB/s)
clear_page function 'new clear_page()   '        took 3840 cycles per page (1522.7 MB/s)
copy_page function 'normal copy_page()'  took 11453 cycles per page (510.5 MB/s)
copy_page function 'new copy_page()   '  took 5024 cycles per page (1163.7 MB/s)
