very much so. Especially for security it's really bad if a feature is 
default-off. I'm quite strongly against such an approach.

i'd rather not overdesign it. And unfortunately there is no good way to 
autodetect it.

is it really a big problem to add "vdso=0" to the long list of 
requirements you need to run a 2.6 kernel on an old distribution (or to 
disable CONFIG_VDSO)? FC1 wasnt even 2.6-ready, it used a 2.4 kernel!
