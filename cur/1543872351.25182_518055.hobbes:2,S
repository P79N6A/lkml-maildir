The problem actually comes about when using Qtopia Phone Edition (QPE)
on a PXA270. QPE puts the console into VT_AUTO+KD_GRAPHICS mode and
writes directly to the framebuffer from then on.  In this mode the
kernel correctly disallows a console change, as QPE is not getting
notification of a console change and thus does not know when to repaint
the screen. 
AFAIK, X uses VT_PROCESS+KD_GRAPHICS mode, so it gets notification of a
change to and from the X console, thus it knows when to repaint the
screen.
I think you can test this by changing the mode of a text console to
KD_GRAPHICS using the KDSETMODE ioctl, then attempting to change to
another text console using chvt.
