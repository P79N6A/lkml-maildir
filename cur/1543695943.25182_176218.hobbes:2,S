I don't have a scratch partition, but the effect is quite apparent when
reading from /dev/hd*
I have 384 megs of ram, no swap, and echo 0 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
kernel is 2.6.0-test9
hdparm -qa 0 /dev/hde ; dd if=/dev/hde of=/dev/null bs=1M count=1024

(hdparm -t /dev/hde opens /dev/hde and reads it for a few seconds, so
these numbers are much the same as my hdparm -t scores)
I also get similar results from /dev/md0 in another machine (the only
not-ide device I can test on... but it's still a bunch of ide drives).
note...
For people playing with hdparm, hdparm -a 123 -t /dev/drive doesn't set
the readahead before running the test.
