Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Performance counter allocator separation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

[Sorry if anyone gets this mail twice, seems that git-send-email
"forgot" to mask the umlaut in my name for this message, causing a few
servers to reject it.]
These two patches fix the performance counter allocator to work even
when the LAPIC NMI watchdog is disabled. It's split up into two patches
to keep the size of the pure regression fix down and allow the cleanup
to be merged once 2.6.22 is out.
If you prefer an all-in-one patch nevertheless, please let me know.
Thanks,
Björn
