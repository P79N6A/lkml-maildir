Ok, got reiser4 running on 1 full 250GB partition on Linux-2.6.21-rc7,
and up running reiser4 on another 2 systems. Have done a lot copy and
have not run into an problem since last night.
I'll try it with 2.6.21 soon.
What would be nice is to get grub2 to boot up on the reiser4
partition. I've seen patch for grub, but not for grub2.
I planning to deploy this for squid caching soon.
Thanks,
Jeff.
