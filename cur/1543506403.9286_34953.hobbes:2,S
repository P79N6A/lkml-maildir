	Hi all:
	I've proben 2.3.14 and it seems to work well only thing is that i cound not make the 
	pnp driver activate my SB AWE64, i read isapnp.txt and did what it said, something 
like:
	cat > /proc/isapnp <<EOF
	card 1 CTL00e4
	dev 0 CTL0045
	port 0x220
	irq 0 5
	dma 0 1
	dma 1 5
	activate
	(i missed in the port part the 0 before the 0x220)
	but it says it doesn't find a card 1 or something like that, i used isapnptools to make the modem work and send this mail ?? Waht is worng ?? i did just as it is in isapnp.txt...
	Another little question: Which of these are ppp-compress-21, ppp-compress-24 and 
	ppp-compress-26 ?? ppp_deflate or bsd_comp ?? BTW does these improve the connection speed if connecting to a NT server, if i put pppstats almost never i see packs with VJCOMP coming to me, more offten sending....
	Thanks for reading...
	Greetings.......
