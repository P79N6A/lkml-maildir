Sounds sane.  But the default version in asm-generic/dma-mapping.h needs to
be fixed up:
static inline void *
dma_alloc_coherent(struct device *dev, size_t size, dma_addr_t *dma_handle,
		   int flag)
{
	BUG_ON(dev->bus != &pci_bus_type);
	return pci_alloc_consistent(to_pci_dev(dev), size, dma_handle);
}
If we stick with this model, we'll still need a new pci_alloc_consistent_gfp().
