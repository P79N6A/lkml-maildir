The hardware headers can't be GPL since they're also used on other
non-Linux systems.  The best we can probably get is a BSD-style license.
Regarding the actual wording, try:
  grep -r "Redistributions in binary form" * | grep -v minimum
I count 130 instances of the same requirement in 2.6.13-rc2, though some
of the files are dual-licensed.
