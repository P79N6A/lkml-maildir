"no", because you don't have to do it in the kernel. You can mount by
uuid or label. For the root FS, you do this from an initrd. Problem
solved.
The only cases when you really need to know the name of a disk is when
 - doing disk-level management, e.g. partitioning or creating file
   systems (*)
 - adding a swap partition (sigh)
 - telling your boot loader where to put its boot sector
(* in principle, you could even avoid this, if you have some means of
   identifying a disk (e.g. via the uuid of a file system). However,
   I would consider such a solution to be overly fragile.)
