This is a very good question.
It's a matter of managing the block layer's request queues.  Somehow 
the existing I/O requests must remain blocked while the requests needed 
for writing the image must be allowed to proceed.
I don't know what would be needed to make this work, but it ought to be 
possible somehow...
