Before you hit 'reply', no, I'm not talking about the machine not 
getting past the BIOS check complaining that there is no keyboard present.
Kernel 2.6.7
model name      : AMD Athlon(tm) XP 2400+
motherboard:

... not sure what else might be useful... apci=off added to boot 
options.  Preemptive kernel.
In any case, the machine in question does not reboot.  I traced the 
problem down to the mach_reboot but it doesn't get past those assembly 
instructions.  Things do seem to work alright if a keyboard is 
installed.  Otherwise, the machine just sits there, no longer responsive 
to pings or anything else.
This appears to be a somewhat common problem, as I found several other 
posters discussing it:

any ideas on what parts of the kernel to look at in order to determine 
what is causing this?
Thankyou,
