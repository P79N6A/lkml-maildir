actually, the default (non-RT) priority of kwaitd is a feature. If there's
lots of exit() activity with lots or running threads (which is the typical
case on an exit-all for threads) then the kwaitd work will nicely cluster
up due it *not* always having the highest priority. This makes the cost of
kwaitd equivalent to the cost of per-CPU lists, asymptotically.
