agreed - i'll fix this. But i can see no big conceptual issue here - 
these resources are all attached to the user context, and that doesnt 
change upon an 'async context-switch'. So it's "only" a matter of 
properly separating the user execution context from the kernel execution 
context. The hardest bit was getting the ptregs details right - the 
FPU/SSE state is pretty much async already (in the hardware too) and 
isnt even touched by any of these codepaths.
