you know what? gcc inlines those automatic even without you typing
"inline". (esp if you have unit-at-a-time enabled)

well.. gcc is not stupid, especially if you give it visibility by
enabling unit-at-a-time. It *WILL* inline static-used-once functions
unless there is a technical reason not to (say variable sized arrays)

you save about 1 cycle by inlining unless there is a trick for the
optimizer. Especially in the case you mention where gcc will dtrt...
it's not worth typing "inline", what if you change the code later to use
the function twice... most people at least forget to remove the
redundant inline, turning it into a bloater...
