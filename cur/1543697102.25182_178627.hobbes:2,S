Well, this should be discussed much more before doing anything.
IMO, for 2.6 FUTEX_FD should be removed or disabled.  It doesn't work
reliably.
As for later, and which extensions to add, Ingo and I discussed this
quite a bit already.  One of the problems is that once you extend the
basic set of operations the possible way are very numerous and the
interfaces can explode in number.
My hopes are that we can come up with some nice and generally useful
additions in the not too distant future and that they can be added to
the 2.6 kernel.  IMO we cannot wait for the next stable release.
I am not sure that this list is the adequate forum for discussing the
futex extensions.  If somebody says where it should take place and
somebody actually declares willingness to work on the implementation
side, I can write down my thoughts and post it.
