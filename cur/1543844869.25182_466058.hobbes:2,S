Ok, I'm a little worried that somebody might want its own magic number, 
but not have its namespace poisoned by other peoples magic numbers (think 
some user-level program like "e2fsck"), but I guess it's unlikely to be a 
real problem.
Pulled.
One more thing: your "please pull" looks fine, but if you were to also add 
the "--summary" argument to the diffstat generation, I'd have seen:

followed by:
 delete mode 100644 include/linux/affs_fs.h
 delete mode 100644 include/linux/hpfs_fs.h
 create mode 100644 include/linux/magic.h
 delete mode 100644 include/linux/openprom_fs.h
which is nice. You see which files actually disappear or appear (or are 
renamed). Ok?
