Hello!
I believe the Linux kernel community needs something like Mozilla'a
Tinderbox that reports compile problems automatically. But since nobody
seems to do it automatically, I'll do it manually :-)
I'm compiling 2.4.0-test3-pre9 on i586 without SMP and it fails in
kernel/timer.c:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/local/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe  -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=k6
-fno-strict-aliasing   -c -o timer.o timer.c
timer.c: In function `update_process_times':
timer.c:580: structure has no member named `priority'
timer.c:580: `DEF_PRIORITY' undeclared (first use in this function)
timer.c:580: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
timer.c:580: for each function it appears in.)
make[2]: *** [timer.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/linux/kernel'
Regards,
Pavel Roskin
