Me also, however consider this:
Process A which has went into lala land and is spinning out of
control keeps allocating memory.  It fills all of memory, and
then all of a sudden a DIFFERENT process - say Netscape, needs a
half a meg.  The overcommit would give netscape the memory, but
then when netscape USES it, the pages cannot be mapped, and the
kernel kills Netscape, meanwhile it was Process A which caused
the OOM condition 'logically'.  That is the problem I believe, is
that the kernel needs to try and determine using logic which
process is the REAL bad guy.  Next to impossible...
I'm dreaming up a daemon written in C for speed that:
1) Reads a config file of legal possible swapfile locations and
   min/max sizes it can use, etc..
2) Has configurable high/low watermarks to determine when to
   create new swap space.
3) Can monitor memory/swap usage on the fly every X number of
seconds (configurable), and if swap usage hits a certain high
water mark, the daemon can check disk space in the legal places
set forth by the config file, determine which (if any) locations
have enough space to create a swap file, and then creates a swap
file or files as quickly as possible (with nice -20) - possibly
even suspending other processes (configurable), then enables the
new swap file to handle the situation.
Such a daemon could be quite configureable to allow for many
different persons specific situations.  I for example would
probably set it up so that it could make swap on any of 3
partitions I have, would not do so unless X amount of space was
available (to prevent filling up a partition and disturbing
something else), and would have it continue to monitor swap
usage.  It could then determine if it needs to add more swap as
well later on, or determine if it could lose some of the swap.  A
'low watermark' could determine when to sync a particular swap
file and swapoff it.
I wonder if anyone has done this at all?  My solution is an
entirely userland approach, so kernel purists wouldn't have to
worry, however interested people could benefit.
Any takers?  Probably wouldn't be that difficult to code.
Any ideas/suggestions welcome.
