No, only 8 (you are forgetting the 4 bytes return address :). 8 bytes is not
much for a call, you'll have perhaps 20 tops in a chain (160 bytes or so)
out of a few Mb worth of space for stack. For _noticeable_ performance
increase in floating point arithmetic. Kernel is a different animal.
The "right" way would be to ensure just that all doubles on the stack are
16-aligned, but that is extremely hairy and won't give you much (except
headaches).
