Yes, that is probably correct, I saw a few of these:
  sleep: cannot read realtime clock: Unknown error 516
I left the kernel running overnight and this morning I've been using it
with no key repeats or screen blanks so far. Go figure. I imagine they
would come back if I reboot. I'm still seeing the Jack warnings but
that's probably a related but somewhat separate issue. 
I'm building rt5 and will report later.
