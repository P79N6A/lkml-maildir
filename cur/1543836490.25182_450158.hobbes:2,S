Your entire proposal started in the weeds anyway.
Every other hypervisor system supported by Linux has a source code
interface on the Linux side that works reliably and compatibly through
versions and releases. The terrible things you claim will happen have
not. IBM have been doing virtualisation for something like forty years.
IBM is not using magic binary blobs. this also leads me to the
conclusion that you are wrong.
