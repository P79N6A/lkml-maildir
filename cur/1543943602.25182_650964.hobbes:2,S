Sorry cannot supply links to them, they were private mail. For some
reason the Nvidia people seem to be shy to post to mailing lists.
iirc the thread which inspired this patch (together with several
bugs in both novell and kernel.org bugzilla) was 
http://marc.info/?t=116175224500001&r=1&w=2
http://marc.info/?t=116230518000004&r=1&w=2
but you won't find the ultimate conclusion in there unfortunately.
So you have to trust me on that -- it's a bit similar to as to I have
to trust your not yet produced boot log and test results.
