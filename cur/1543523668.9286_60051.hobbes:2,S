What kind of controller it would be? I have a hard time imagining this
would work. Is disk access ever done from interrupt context? Console
switches are done this way but they are basically expected to succeed. So
we can add the requests in the queue and proceed forward.
Heh, let's imagine vesafbd being swapped out to a disk it should be
performing read/write operations on.
