Or leave WIRELESS_EXT at 20 and come up with a new way of versioning any
future changes in WE.. Yes, having two different mechanisms for version
number is ugly, but it could prevent userspace breakage.
(And based on the other messages in this thread, it might be useful to
include the userspace program's idea of the version in those new
commands to allow multiple interface versions to be supported by the
kernel).
