If the debug output is enabled and
a line discipline other than N_TTY is used,
then you get an oops when the NULL method
is called.
Since the debug output is not enabled by
default, and is probably never really used,
it is not a significant bug.
I thought it might be worth eliminating or
correcting the debug outputs since they seem
to get cloned into new serial drivers.
It is certainly not a big problem.
