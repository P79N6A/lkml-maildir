OK, I've added that - it could be said that a page entitled
'm68k-elf-tools' is perhaps not the obvious place to find stuff for m68k
and ARM that specifically produces something other than ELF :-)

Also added - but it breaks Javascript on Mozilla for me, and the menu

non-Javascript version - making it useless in simpler browsers.
It does however have a very nice penguin.
