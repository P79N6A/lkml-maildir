People keep arguing that the signature is somehow not part of the
kernel or not subject to copyright law.  I suspect they do not realize
how broad the legal definition of "computer program" is.

The GPL does not guarantee anyone a viable business model.  Following
it is not conditional on profitability.  It is only conditional on
exercising rights that are granted by the GPL.
