Btw, that's read as >> (32 + 1). My fault.

Indeed, I did it so following i386 code (where fixing this is awkward - doable 
with carry sums or 64-bit sums), but it's better this way.
I'd slightly prefer (for readability) (xloops * HZ * 
cpu_data[raw_smp_processor_id()].loops_per_jiffy +
(1<<32)-1) >> 32, or even
DIV_ROUND_UP(xloops * HZ * cpu_data[raw_smp_processor_id()].loops_per_jiffy, 1 
<< 32)
but kernel.h macros such as that seem to be underused (everything reimplements 
them as min() and max() before 2.6) and should be made more consistent in 
naming:
#define ALIGN(x,a) (((x)+(a)-1UL)&~((a)-1UL))
#define DIV_ROUND_UP(n,d) (((n) + (d) - 1) / (d))
#define roundup(x, y) ((((x) + ((y) - 1)) / (y)) * (y))
I hope that gcc optimizes well x / (1<<32) to x >> 32, but without assurance I 
won't use DIV_ROUND_UP in timer code.
 (I also thought there was a bug, so I had a deep look and the difference 
between -1 in roundup and -1UL is correct due to sign extension ruining 
bitmasks, even if it seemed a bad mismatch).
