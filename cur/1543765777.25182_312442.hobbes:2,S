Hello
I need help about scheduling. I hope i understand the basics for my
question: An active prozess counts the remaining cpu time in jifies. By
every timer interrupt the scheduler decrements the variable time_slice.
Where is the scheduler initializing the interrupt timer (init_timer).
And where gets the struct timer_list the next interrupt (expires). At
last i want know where the scheduler calls add_timer. Or is there an
other way?
Thank You
Gunter
