I think it is totaly your call what you store in it. Only requirement
is that you never pass 0 to the filler function.
off_t is 64bit so storing DIR* in it should be no problem. Or a
pointer to
struct UnionDIR {
  DIR *dp;
  struct UnionDIR *next;
}

You could add them up and round it to some common block size (if they
differ). But I don't think it maters and nothing uses that info.
What is more important is the link count. For example find uses the
link count to know how many subdirs a directory has. Once it found
that many it assumes there are no more dirs and saves on stat() calls.

Afaik never. The offset is only stored for the next readdir call but
never used inside fuse.

Why don't you use the existing fuse-unionfs?
