Sure, I can do that.  That leads me to think that maybe we should
delete name from struct device and just use the one in struct kobject
(which is already a mere 16 bytes).  But if we're going to go as far
down as the kobject... that has a dentry.  And dentrys have names.
So how about eliminating that too and just creating a dentry with the
almost infinitely long name?
Maybe that's too much at this stage of the game.
