You did notice we are testing a different struct file?

The whole concept is recursive so I'm not certain being a recursive check
is that bad but I understand the point.
I think the right answer is most likely to add an extra file method or
two so we can remove the need for is_file_hugepages.
There are still 4 calls to is_file_hugepages in ipc/shm.c and
2 calls in mm/mmap.c not counting the one in is_file_shm_hugepages.
The special cases make it difficult to properly wrap hugetlbfs files
with another file, which is why we have the weird special case above.
