Did you separate out the parser out into a user-space daemon?
Also, if you want a regular programming language with an extremely small 
interpreter, try Forth.
Learning Forth should be at LEAST as much fun as learning LISP.

I bet a Forth interpreter would be smaller.
And for something specialized like security policy, you could probably 
develop your own language and interpreter for it, and it would be 
smaller (and faster) still.

You misunderstand.  When I say "VERY TINY kernel component", I'm 
referring to the interpreter.  Done properly, the pcode for the policy 
itself would be microscopic.

Forth.
