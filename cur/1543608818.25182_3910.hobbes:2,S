There are some people who think that the 5kB stack we have now is too
small ;(

That should work fairly well, and has the advantage that you can hide more
state there if you want (ie it allows us, on demand, to move hot state of
"struct task_struct" up there).
There is a subset of "struct task_struct" that is basically completely
local to the task, and could be advantageous to move around. Things like
 - need_resched/sigpending/process attributes
 - ptrace
 - processor
 - addr_limit
are all things that we don't actually _need_ to go all the way to the task
structure to fetch, and that we mostly need to modify anyway on task
switch (ie "need_resched" and "processor" both need to be written on
task-switch anyway, and are not touched by anything other CPU)
So it would basically be a small per-CPU/thread area, not just the "struct
task_struct".
