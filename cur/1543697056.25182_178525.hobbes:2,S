I guess its mostly due to scheduling latency. I think IRQ latency is
generally very good these days.
Scheduling latency caused not by long critical sections in the kernel,
but having things scheduled in front of you (X) for a long time.

OK thanks. I think this problem you were seeing _was_ interrupt latency
due to AS doing millions of WARNs. It should be fixed in mm3.

Sounds like it.
