hmm, i got another issue while compiling :
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  UPD     include/linux/compile.h
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/i386/kernel/built-in.o: In function `get_memcfg_from_srat':
/home/legoater/linux/2.6.20-rc6-mm3/arch/i386/kernel/srat.c:279: undefined reference to `acpi_find_root_pointer'
it seems that drivers/acpi/tables/tbxfroot.c is never compiled ?
