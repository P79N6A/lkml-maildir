Gee I should follow other peoples advice about it takes two idiots to
argue in public, and not reply to the "troll bait".
So I wait for your political crap and ideas of making it impossible for
businesses with IP and property that is not and will never be open to work
inside or with Linux.
So with your bait and troll rants, I will challenge you and the rest of
the GPL only pinheads, to the pre-loader module issue which is gpl'd.
What are you going to do now?  Sue, send laywers, please I invite and beg
you to do so.  The "freed_symbols" project just got energized!
Cheers,
Andre
