  Since vendors (and consultants) like to build a single kernel for use on
multiple machines, it would be nice if this could be done by some init
code (released) and a module. I don't know what the overhead would be,
perhaps the runtime code is so small it's not worth doing. Does that mean
it's not worth doing the option either? It certainly would seen desirable
to check for the F00F bug and if the code to handle it was not present
refuse to boot right away.
  The code actually looks so small as to be unworthy of an option, given
that many people would set it off not knowing was it was much less whether
they needed it. This is not like a missing FPU where you can do a graceful
reject of the instructions, if you have the bug and not the fix you are
vulnerable to sudden total failures, correct?
