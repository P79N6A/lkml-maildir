This file has been deleted because it is %100 inaccurate.
It is not the place to look for maintainership.
Oddly enough, proper place for "MAINTAINER" information is in file
"linux/MAINTAINERS".
In that file you will find this entry:
NETWORKING [IPv4/IPv6]
P:      David S. Miller
M:      davem@redhat.com
P:      Alexey Kuznetsov
M:      kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru

L:      netdev@oss.sgi.com
S:      Maintained
Which mentions netdev@oss.sgi.com as the mailing list for
discussions like this one.
linux-net@vger.kernel.org is for mainly user-level configuration
discussions.
