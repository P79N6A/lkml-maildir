Dear Kernel developers,
I would like to know if there is a specific maillists for the PCMCIA kernel driver developers.
I search through vger.kernel.org, but I did not find any relevant maillists for PCMCIA.
Should I post all my PCMCIA related queries to kernel lists. Please help in guiding.
Regards,
Mukund Jampala
