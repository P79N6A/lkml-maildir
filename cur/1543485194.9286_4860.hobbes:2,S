I got gobs of these messeges flitting by an instant before rebooting
during shutdown of vanilla 2.2.1 to boot 2.2.2-pre2.  I also got them
shutting down 2.2.0 as I recall.  What I managed to scribble onto my
credit card bill was:
try_to_unuse: 8d000 count=1
System was 2.2.1 UP on a PPro 200, gcc2.7.2.3 compiled.  The system had
been 'generally' used including some heavy mem thrashing tests, make -j's,
knfsd, bonnie and lots of soundblaster stuff, just to narrow things down -
NOT.
