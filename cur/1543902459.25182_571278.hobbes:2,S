If the code was not too hackish, I would not buy that.
Routers for example can run -- minus the userspace utilities required to set
things up -- "without" userspace. Maybe someone even comes along and
writes the network interface setup as __init kernel code. If not that,
maybe a code generator. I also remember someone who posted sort of a
"kernel console" patch (same reason - to avoid userspace).
