What about isa_ioremap ? Result from it is a token passed to
isa_readx/isa_writex and the arch side can be implemented with a
couple of #defines on x86. 
It's easy to change I beleive, and it paves the way for archs to
add a notion of "token" in the high bits (as we _know_ an ISA address
is small). Those token can be used by arch to route to proper PCI
bus when several host bridges exist, to route to PCMCIA when the
PCMCIA uses it's own "ISA" memory space like on PPC, etc...
Later on, we can see things like
ulong pci_get_bus_isa_base(int busno);
And the same for PCMCIA & whatever 16 bits busses that can exist on
embedded hardware.
That way, support for multiple busses (either real ISA, embedded custom
busses using legacy devices, several PCI hosts with ISA bridges, ...)
can be implemented very easily. In most case adjusting the drivers
probe code.
I'd like to see the same kind of things for IOs in fact but that's
another debate ;)

Ben.
