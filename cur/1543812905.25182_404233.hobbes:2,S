Subject: [PATCH] mm: yield during swap prefetching
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Swap prefetching doesn't use very much cpu but spends a lot of time waiting on 
disk in uninterruptible sleep. This means it won't get preempted often even at 
a low nice level since it is seen as sleeping most of the time. We want to 
minimise its cpu impact so yield where possible.
