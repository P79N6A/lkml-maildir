Also, delegations are about caching. That's true. It improve NFS
performance because a client with a lease does not need to worry about
server change and can manipulate files using local cache.  But if
speculative execution can achieve the same goal without incurring the
cost of lease renewal and revoke, delegation becomes less useful.
So my question is essentially: if speculative execution is there, why
do we still need delegation? Can delegation do anything better?
