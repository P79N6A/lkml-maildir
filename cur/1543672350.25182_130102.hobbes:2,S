Hi,
i just came over this patch, and wondered why is it missing
in both 2.4 and 2.5 (the code in do_rename is identical in both
kernels).
Are such renames really not allowed, or was it just fixed differently?

Hi,
I just discovered that rename(2) does not allow you to rename a file within
the same filesystem if there is a "--bind" in the way. For example:
# mkdir mydir
# mount --bind . mydir
# touch myfile
# strace -erename perl -e 'rename "myfile", "mydir/myfile2"'
rename("myfile", "mydir/myfile2") = -1 EXDEV (Invalid cross-device link)
IMHO it should be possible to do a rename in this situation.
I propose to remove the check in do_rename() altogether. It shouldn't be
necessary, since there's also a check for a cross-device rename in
vfs_rename_dir() and vfs_rename_other().
Patch below has been tested.
