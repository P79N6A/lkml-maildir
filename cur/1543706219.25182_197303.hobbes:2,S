Only G450/G550 display same picture (from CRTC1) on all outputs, MAVEN output
is by default disabled until you'll configure it with 'matroxset'. 
If you want same picture on both outputs even for G400, it should be 
enough to replace
ACCESS_FBINFO(outputs[1]).src = MATROXFB_SRC_NONE;
with
ACCESS_FBINFO(outputs[1]).src = MATROXFB_SRC_CRTC1;
in maven_init_client() in drivers/video/matrox/matroxfb_maven.c.
(it is not enabled by default as on G400 you can have either Maven output
or DFP output but not both; G450/G550 does not have such restriction,
and so on G450/G550 all three outputs show same picture by default).
