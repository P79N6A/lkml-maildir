One thing you also want to do is to go through your benchmark adding prefetch
instructions about 320 bytes ahead of current data. Even with 133MHz SDRAM on
an Athlon that can add 40% to your throughput.
Prefetch data, prefetchw data you will be writing too. On DDR it should be an
even bigger win.

Yes that is a bit odd.

The DMA was off because the BIOS left it off.
