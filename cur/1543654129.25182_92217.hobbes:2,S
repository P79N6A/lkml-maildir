The only place where a protection is needed is inside ep_insert() and not
because of the wake_up() outsize the lock. Because of this :
        /* Add the current item to the list of active epoll hook for this file */
        spin_lock(&tfile->f_ep_lock);
        list_add_tail(&epi->fllink, &tfile->f_ep_links);
        spin_unlock(&tfile->f_ep_lock);
