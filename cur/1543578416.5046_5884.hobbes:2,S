8. That's weird - according to my maillogs colorfullife.com (my own
server) only sent 6 copies to everyone.
The attached one is the 5. messages, so probably one more will come.
I have no idea what caused the duplication, probably I misconfigured
something with smarthost.
clsrvli: internal server, smarthost to colorfullife.com
colorfullife.com: real server, sends messages to the rest of the world.
The message had 6 receivers, and one of them was unreachable for 50
minutes. It seems the sendmail resend the message to all receivers,
although the first 5 were successful.
One retry every 10 minutes --> 6 duplicates
Sorry,
