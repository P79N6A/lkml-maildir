Agreed.  But this would be outside of the cache-coherence protocol.
That said, cross-CPU timing measurements have been very helpful to
me in the past when messing with memory ordering.  Spooky to be able
to prove that a single variable really does have multiple values at
a single point in time, from the perspectives of different CPUs!  ;-)

All the hardware that I have had intimate knowledge of has adhered to
this constraint.
