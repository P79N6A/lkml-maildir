It's wrong.
I don't think we should be able to do a mntput() _either_ inside the
spinlock. The filesystem should not "know" that mntput is safe.
For this reason I don't think "dput_locked()" is the right answer either.
Why are we doing the mntget/dget at all? We hold the spinlock, so we know
they are not going away. Not doing the mntget/dget means that we (a) run
faster and (b) don't have the bug, because we don't need to put the damn
things.
Comments?
