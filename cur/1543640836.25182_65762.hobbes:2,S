IMO this should not be done by the kernel, but by the application.
Reasons:
- actually, there is no key "a" etc that is pressed, but "1" etc.
- you loose ability to keep the display up to date according
  to the pressed key sequence while composing characters, otherwise.
- it is easy for the application to check the timing of the
  keys pressed and produce the desired characters instead [poll (2)].
- not all projects using the keyboard in question will need the
  sequence-to-character conversion You describe. e.g. cash register.
