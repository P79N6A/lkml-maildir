I think having the ability to have both can be usefull, so the idea of 
having multiple listeners fd (that both would not work with the single 
queue since they'd racing over dequeue_signal).
The two place where I plugges signalfd_notify() has the siginfo already 
compiled, so I just need to:
1) Pass the siginfo pointer to signalfd_notify too
2) Switch from having a bitmap, to a struct list_head queue
3) Dequeue and return the signal and siginfo inside a compat-free 
   structure
The #2 makes code even easier actually. The poll would just do a 
list_empty(), and dequeueing is just get-head and list_del().
