An SMP related area you might want to look at (if you haven't already)
is hotplug cpu support. There seems to be some interaction between
dynticks and hotplug that prevents a CPU from getting to set its state
to CPU_DEAD (despite being in the idle function), while the thread
seeking to down it sits in __cpu_die waiting. I observed the issue while
testing Suspend2 - about 1 in 5 resumes would lock solid or have a big
delay at resume time (never when suspending, interestingly). Turning off
dynticks allowed me to do 15 successful resumes on the trot.
Regards.
