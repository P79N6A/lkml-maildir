No. No. -1 is the sign for undetermined that is also used in other pieces 
of slab.c. Meaning do not do node specific allocs. The fix  
should only modify kmem_cache_alloc_node. But we wont need that if the 
new slab allocator would get in. Andrew?
Also if powerpc wants to use node specific allocations for block devices 
then the powerpc arch needs to supply a pcibus_to_node function that does 
return the correct node for the pcibus.
