This might help you with engineering, and sourceforge.net is willing
to provide you the bandwidth. If you create an account on sf.net, I

Oh, and I believe we do not need exactly Larry for this, just someone
who uses bk anyway and is willing to supervise the scripts. [I'm
mostly on modem, and often go away for > week.]
