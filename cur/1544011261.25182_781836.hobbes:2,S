It is not possible to calculate it in advance for the search commands,
since we do not know how many slave devices are attached to the bus.
This buffer is used as temporal area where IDs are stored and when
number of IDs is large enough message is emmitted to the userspace and
buffer becomes empty again. Sending one message per slave ID is a too
big overhead, so this could be half of a page or one third or whatever
else, I selected a page, which is the maximum guaranteed allocation
buffer size.

Ok, I will space it to the left. Should I sent patch on top of it or
instead of?
