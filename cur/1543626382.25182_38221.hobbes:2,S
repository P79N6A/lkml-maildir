1. you want $(mymodule) instead of $mymodule
2. instead of \\$ you want $$
3. you need to use the @ construct.
vcs was the module I looked for.
Don't put quotes around it... that has make passing the quotes too.
End result is something like the following:
mymodule=vcs
target:
        @major=`awk '$$2 == "$(mymodule)" {print $$1}' /proc/devices`
        @echo $$major
Whether or not you really want to do this is something else.
