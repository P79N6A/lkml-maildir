avoid is what i meant.. sorry..

no they won't, of course not. risk of OOM is a feature of an
overcommiting VM. no way round it.

note that i said "be /able/ to". Ie If as admin could limit each user in
@users to 50MB of address space on a 4 user box, then i just need to
make sure that i have > 200MB of RAM+swap, to know that i will never OOM
because of @user processes.
most people though would accept more risk with potential OOM for more
flexible VM usage. 
It'd be nice to have that choice. And i'm pretty sure per-user VM
beancounting would allow me to pretty much reduce risk of OOM to close
to 0 on my boxes..

of course, i wouldn't suggest otherwise. OOM is a risk you take with
just about every present day OS.
