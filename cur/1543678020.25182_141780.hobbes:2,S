Ok, that doesnt really seem to change behavior much (from just a little
testing). I can still easily starve xmms by moving a window around over
mozilla or evolution (I suspect for thoose that use nautilus to draw the
desktop that would happen on an 'empty' desktop too..). 
With 2.5.72-mm1, HZ 1000 and MAX_SLEEP_AVG 2 that does *not* happen,
even with a cpu hog running (mpeg2enc) or during make -j20. However with
this kernel, after having moved a window around madly for a while the
mouse pointer is very laggy/jerky for atleast 30 sec after i release the
window (not so with your patch). 
I'm not hitting swap at all, so thats not a factor here.
