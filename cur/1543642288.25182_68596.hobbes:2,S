OK, thanks.  I can't immediately think of anything which would have
altered the refcounting in there except for page reclaim.  
What you could do is to check whether the `page_count(page) != 1'
pages are on the LRU.  If they have !PageLRU(page) then the extra
ref was taken by shrink_cache().  But that would be pretty rare,
especially on UP.
You may have more success using the stronger invalidate_inode_pages2().
