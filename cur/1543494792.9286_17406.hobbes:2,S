Dick, I suggest that you:
a) Drag out your damp and moldy copy of K&R
b) Go to the index and lookup "Assignment expression"
c) Read AND UNDERSTAND all of the references you find there
In short, an assignment expression evaluates to the final value assigned
to the left side; not, as you've asserted above, "if the assignment
succeeded". Hence, when appearing in an 'if' statement, 
	(a = <some expression>)
will evaluate to "true" if 'a' gets a non-zero value and evaluates to
false if 'a' gets a value of zero....
