   Below is a patch to add anycast support for IPv6. It's the same patch as
   I've posted previously, but updated with comments from Chris Hellwig and
   for kernel version 2.5.44.
I'm going to apply this, with the small change that dev_getany() is
renamed to dev_get_by_flags() which more accurately describes
what the routine does.
Thanks David.
