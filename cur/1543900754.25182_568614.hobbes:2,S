(256+32*63) * 63 = 143136
Do you have any actual numbers for how much this hurts?

Did you consider using percpu_counters (or such) at interrupt-time? 
(warning: percpu_counters aren't presently interrupt safe).

You other patch is a straightforward optimisation and should just be merged.
But afaict it will only provide a 2x speedup which I doubt is sufficient?
Another thought is: how many of the NR_IRQS counters are actually non-zero?
Because a pretty obvious optimisation would be to have a global
bitmap[NR_IRQS] and do
	if (!bitmap[irq])
		bitmap[irq] = 1;
at interrupt-time, then just print a "0" for the interrupts which have
never occurred within show_stats().
