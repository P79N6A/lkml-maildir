Hi Jordan.

I have about a dozen places where I can RECEIVE email, and my postings
could come from any of them, but I have set them all up to show the
same FROM address when I SEND emails out. As a result, I can see no
need to support more than one email address per person.
For reference, look at the headers of this email. You should see
something like the following:
 Q> From: Riley Williams <rhw@MemAlpha.CX>
 Q> X-Sender: rhw@ps.cus.umist.ac.uk
The first line states the email address I wish to be known as, and the
second states the account I actually used to send that particular
email.
Best wishes from Riley.
