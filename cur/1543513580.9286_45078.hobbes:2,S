Subject: 2.3.23pre5: drivers/char/bttv.c and drivers/usb/cpia.c do not compile

	Given the complexity of switching to a memory model where
physical != kernel, as the BIGMEM stuff requires, it is amazing that
these are the only drivers in 2.3.23pre5 that have non-trivial problems
compiling.  Anyhow, I thought somebody should report it.
	drivers/char/bttv.c
	drivers/usb/cpia.c
	These files are very similar.  It looks as if one were written
from the other.  Both of these files define a routine called uvirt_to_kva
that attempts to do some arithmetic on the result of pte_page(),
which used to be an unsigned long, but now is pointer to a
structure.  Both of these files then want to convert that address to
a "bus" address.  I am a little unclear on the new kernel memory
mapping system, so I will just report these problems for now.  If nobody
fixes them, then I will probably get around to taking a whack at it.
