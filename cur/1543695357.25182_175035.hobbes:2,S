[To reduce noise, i've replied personally to specific points not
of general interest to the list.  Here's an (updated) summary]
Yeah, much of what was in the earlier summary has been cleared up.  
I am pleased to report that aside from the SWIM3 and MESH problems
for which i have workaround patches, i think my PPC issues for 2.6.0
have been mostly resolved.
The two remaining annoyances on the PowerMac 8500 are losing sync
switching from X to the framebuffer console and the slab corruptions 
warnings when ejecting a CDROM.  
One not specific to PPC is that it would be better if 'bootlogd' 
didn't *silently* wait for RAID5 to finish parity reconstruction.
Thanks for the hard work and suggestions!
