In the overall kernel (Linus's bk tree) I count:
	733 lines matching 'for *( *; *; *)'
	718 lines matching 'while *( *1 *)'
In the kernel/*.c files, I count 15 of the 'for(;;)' style and 1 of the
'while(1)' style.
Certainly the 'for(;;)' style is acceptable, and even slightly to
substantially dominant, depending on which piece of code you're in.
