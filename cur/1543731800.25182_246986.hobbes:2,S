i've uploaded -Q5 to:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc1-bk4-Q5
ontop of:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/diff-bk-040828-2.6.8.1.bz2
-Q5 should fix the PS2 problems and the early boot problems, and it
might even fix the USB, ACPI and APIC problems some people were
reporting.
There were a number of bugs that led to the PS2 problems:
 - a change to __cond_resched() in the -Q series caused the starvation
   of the IRQ1 and IRQ12 threads during init - causing a silent timeout
   and misdetection in the ps2 driver(s).
 - even with the starvation bug fixed, we must set system_state to
   SCHEDULER_OK only once the init thread has started - otherwise the
   idle thread might hang during bootup.
 - the redirected IRQ handling now matches that of non-redirected IRQs
   better, the outer loop in generic_handle_IRQ has been flattened.
i also re-added the synchronize_irq() fix, it was not causing the PS2
problems.
