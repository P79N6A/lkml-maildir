While looking through the new header files, I noticed lots of occurences
of #ifdef CONFIG_X86_32 in headers files exported for glibc.
This is fundamentally broken because user applications including them
do not know about any CONFIG_* symbols, and if they did, those
would incorrectly describe the ABI.
I guess in most cases, the headers that are interesting to user space
can simply be merged without any such #ifdef remaining, but those
that are still needed should be converted to use #ifdef __x86_64__,
which is set by the compiler.
This is how the other architectures avoid this particular problem.
