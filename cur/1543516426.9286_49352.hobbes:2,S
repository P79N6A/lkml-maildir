Subject: Frequent oops in shrink_mmap

Google runs on a cluster of 2000+ Linux/Intel machines.  We have a
problem on several of those machines, a symptom of which is kernel oops
messages in try_to_free_buffers, called from shrink_mmap.  (The machines
which have these kernel oops messages tend to have poor performance in
general, even at times when the oops aren't being generated.)
We are currently running 2.2.7 on these machines, but I see from
searching linux-kernel traffic that the problem of kernel oops in
shrink_mmap is a long-standing one which has been reported in many
different kernel versions, up to at least 2.2.12, and has also been
reported in Linux/Alpha.  I've looked at all of the past archives, and I
didn't see any definitive response to these problems.
The problem is probably related to heavy disk use and/or heavy network
traffic and/or heavy parallel processing with threads.  These are the
circumstances under which we tend to see the problem, and also are
circumstances that I see correlated with past reports of this problem.
I have 56 of these oops messages from 10 different machines, all at
exactly the same location.  I've attached a sample at the end of this
note.  Most of them look very similar (to each other, and to other oops
messages previously posted to this list).  But I would be happy to
forward all of them to anyone who can use them.  I could collect even
more if that would be helpful.
It's possible that the problem is associated with or caused by a
hardware problem.  Out of thousands of machines, we could easily have 10
with some specific problem.  But I don't really know what kind of a
problem, or why it would manifest itself only in this particular way.
Also, the fact that the same problem occurs in Linux/Alpha makes me
suspect some sort of software flaw.
We would greatly appreciate any constructive suggestions or help with
this problem.  I would be glad to send a Google T-shirt to anyone who
can help.
