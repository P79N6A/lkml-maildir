Greetings -
I am a newbie and not familiar with the accepted way of posting bugs,
so I am simply sending you a link to the appropriate forum discussion.
I believe we have a kernel bug in the released version of openSUSE 11.1 
(64 bit).
I have confirmed what another user (ansbar) found:  Any attempt to 
install 64 bit
11.1 from DVD or NET media onto a D945GCLF2 platform results in a
kernel oops soon after the version of kernel supplied with the distribution
loads and runs.
As an aside, the platform I attempted to upgrade currently is running 
11.0 (64 bit),
which has been running without any evidence of problems.
I hope the discussion gives you enough info to go on.  If not, feel free to
ask questions.  Here's the link:

Thanks,
