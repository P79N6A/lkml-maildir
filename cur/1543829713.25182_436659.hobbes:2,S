The dwarf2-defs.h file is similar to the asm-offsets.h file. We need it
before starting to build the kernel.
So the only same solution would be to move it all to the Kbuild file in
the top-level directory. Then we should also let same Kbuild file take
care of cleaning up.
I noticed that kgdb patches was dropped in -mm this time.
Shall I try to cook up a patch next time you include kgdb?
