Subject: [PATCH 2.6.9-rc2-mm4 sba_iommu.c] Replace pci_find_device with pci_get_device
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

As pci_find_device is going away soon I have replaced the call with pci_get_device.
Judith, could you run these 3 ia64 ones through PLM, please? This should complete the
arch/ia64 conversion.
Thanks a lot.
