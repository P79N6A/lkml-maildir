No. ;-) But it's another issue. I'm loading the hisax drivers first:
hisax                 492836   1 
isdn                  119072   1  [hisax]
slhc                    4624   0  [isdn]
[...]
And after them (and the ippp-related programs..) the drivers for avmb1:
ppp_deflate            40928   0  (unused)
bsd_comp                4056   0  (unused)
ppp_synctty             4768   0  (unused)
ppp_generic            18240   0  [ppp_deflate bsd_comp ppp_synctty]
b1isa                   3740   1 
b1                     17152   0  [b1isa]
capidrv                25716   1 
capi                   17344   0 
capifs                  3712   1  [capi]
kernelcapi             29796   4  [b1isa capidrv capi]
capiutil               22368   0  [capidrv kernelcapi]
[...]
I'm connecting with the avmb1-card to a provider via pppd and starting my iptables firewall (with qos scheduling). While connected or after shutting down the connection unloading the hisax or isdn modules produces that oops. I haven't tried it without the sched-modules loaded. Should I ? It seems that they could be responsible too.
Please note that the avmb1 (b1isa) card is active and hisax a passive one.
Hope that helps.
