I would actually much rather not have this code in the kernel at all.
Given that I cannot find any documentation of the ALPS interface and
have no confidence of being able to detect an ALPS device or that
different ALPS devices behave the same way, I simply don't think this
stuff belongs in the kernel.
What I would much rather do is have /dev/psaux really be a char-dev
interface to the PS2 AUX port on the computer (rather than a faked
ps-aux look alike sythesised from all available mice) and have a
user-space program read that device, interpret it in a
user-configurable way, and send mouse events into /dev/input/uinput so
that other parts of the system see the appropriate moouse events.
I have code that does this but haven't had time to sort out a few
remaining little issues.
What I would *really* like to do is change /dev/psaux so that:
  If it is opened by user-space, it gets all chars from the AUX port,
  and input/mousedev doesn't see them.
  If it is not open, chars from /dev/psaux would bet processed by the
  current mouse driver.
Is there any chance that this might be accepted?
