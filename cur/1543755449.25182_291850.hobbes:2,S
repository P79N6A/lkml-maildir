I don't think it's HPET timer, or CONFIG_SMP. It also looks like your
local APIC timer is working.
If you have a serial console, you can put one letter printks in the
code. Can you check if you ever get to smp_apic_timer_interrupt()?
That's where you should get to after the sleep, and that calls the
PIT timer interrupt to get it going again. I'm thinking that you'll
get to smp_apic_timer_interrupt(), but once therebut function
dyn_tick->interrupt(0, NULL, regs) never gets called.
It's OK to put printks to the timer code here, there's tons of 
output only when the system is busy :)
Also, can you post your .config again? And also please post output
from:
dmesg | grep -i "time\|tick\|apic"

Yeah, I've been meaning to, I just subscribed to it yesterday.
