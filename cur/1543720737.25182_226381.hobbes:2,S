Forcing kernel developers to distort their coding to keep stack sizes 
small is not a good idea, as it makes the whole kernel harder to code 
for a not very compelling (for 99% of users, please argue with me if you 
think it is otherwise) benefit.
I do not think I favor disturbing V3's stability for the sake of the 4k 
stack option, but my mind is still open.
