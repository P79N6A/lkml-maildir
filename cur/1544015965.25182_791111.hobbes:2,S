Right, there are cases where you could hit 2MB but they aren't likely
to be that common.
In particular the common case is to allocate a single word of per
cpu data, with a given allocation request.  To get 2 2MB with
8byte requests requires 262144 different, which is a lot
more than I expect to be common any time soon.
So I figure reserving a 2MB tlb entry is not likely what we want,
in the common case.

But the question is what is per cpu memory.  Per cpu memory is
something we can access quickly without creating cross cpu
cache line contention.
Accessing that memory from other cpus implies we create that
contention and will be the slow path.   We need to do cross
cpu access for the rollup of the statistics, but we clearly
don't want to do it often.
So I expect most times we will want to store a pointer to per
cpu data will be a bug. 
per cpu memory is not something we ever want to use to lightly.
So as long as the rules are clear we should be ok.  And simply
removing the address of function for per cpu data would make it impossible
to point into it.  So I think it is worth a look, to see if we can
move live per cpu data.  As it noticeably simplifies the problem of
growing a per cpu area in the rare case when we need to.
