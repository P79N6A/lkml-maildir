That is why Linux 2.2 has added the TCP_CORK option to avoid the problem. 
From netman tcp.7:
 TCP_CORK
              If  enabled  don't  send  out  partial frames.  All
              queued partial frames are sent when the  option  is
              cleared again.  This is useful for prepending head-
              ers before calling sendfile(2), or  for  throughput
              optimization.  This  option cannot be combined with
              TCP_NODELAY.
So you enable TCP_CORK, write the headers, start the sendfile, and then
clear TCP_CORK again - everything goes out in one packet.
