I am having a lot of problems with a dual processor celeron Abit BP6
motherboard.  Running lilo does not produce any errors, but after a
reboot I get 'System Halted'.  I originally tried a 2.4.4 SMP kernel,
but have since been trying a non-SMP kernel with the same results.
The boot drive is /dev/hde.  Anytime I boot with a floppy, or CDROM
everything looks okay on the drive, but after I type chroot /mnt
everything starts seg-faulting.
I think the problem is with the UDMA controller which is an integrated
Hightpoint UDMA controller.  The drive is a 10GB Western Digital UDMA66
drive on /dev/hde.  Has anybody experienced this problem before?
Thanks for any help.
