Hello,
I need add a device for a particular solution on a x86 box. Device is
Logitech QuickCam, USB based WebCam (has to be included because of the
change in the experiment specs).
To get the device working (capture images by a V4L application), need
to compile the driver (qc-usb) & insert the quickcam.ko module. But,
what the requirement says I need to enable the VIDEO_V4L1 support.
Then I need to select USB_QUICKCAM_MESSENGER driver under the V4L USB
devices. Till here it's fine.
But if I look at the kernel config, VIDEO_V4L1 is deprecated. If I
decide to enable VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT, there isn't any
USB_QUICKCAM_MESSENGER driver under the V4L USB devices!
Should I select the VIDEO_V4L1 support to get the WebCam working or is
there any other way (work around) to get my WebCam working with
VIDEO_V4L1_COMPAT? Comments pl?
