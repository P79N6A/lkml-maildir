Thanks!
It helps. mplayer skips much less, but still some skipping is present.
I experimented with forcing entire file to be present in the
pagecache, and in this case mplayer almost never skips.
Looks like mplayer have very little tolerance for reads
randomly taking more time to read input stream.
However, I then looked into the mplayer's source
(I wondered why it doesn't do read buffering itself)...
The code is, um, less than pretty.
