Oh, don't ask me, I don't have a time to study these patches currently :)
_Perhaps_ we can do something better than add explicit checks in freezer_...count,
but I can't suggest anything. Btw, we don't need task_lock() to test current->mm,
and I believe we don't need to check PF_BORROWED_MM there.
"[PATCH 2/3] Freezer: Take kernel_execve into consideration" looks a bit incomplete
to me... I agree, this is a good change for now. But, assuming that we can spawn
an "arbitrary" user-space process from kernel space, we may freeze some kernel
thread which is needed for that user-space task to proceed and notice a signal.
I am starting to suspect that call_usermodehelper() needs a special attention
from freezer, but again, I can't suggest anything, at least right now.
"[PATCH 3/3] Freezer: Prevent ___call_usermodehelper from missing freezing requests"
looks unneeded to me, we should imho drop flush_signals() instead. At least, please
don't call do_not_freeze() under sighand->siglock. This looks as if we have a subtle
reason for this lock, but we don't ? Oh, wait ...  ____call_usermodehelper() does
recalc_sigpending() after flush_signals()! This means we can't lost a "fake" signal
from freezer, so we don't need this patch. Agreed?
Apart from "[PATCH 3/3]", I have nothing against these patches, they fix real problems.
Oleg.
