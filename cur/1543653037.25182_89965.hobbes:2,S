On my s390 system, I can have many thousand devices and none of them is
doing DMA, so I would indeed call it architecture specific. Note that 
even in a normal PC system, most devices (e.g. CPUs, input devices or
the disks attached to the host adapter) don't have any concept of
DMA.

Maybe, but if you put dma_mask in struct device, you are making it a property
of every single device in the system.

That does not sound right either, but I don't care so much about this because
you are not messing with my devices here. The problem is having two 'struct
device's for one physical device. The Scsi_Host should really be the
*driver_data of the bus devices, with the scsi devices being direct children
of that device.
