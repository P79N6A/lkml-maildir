Subject: [PATCH/RFC] minix filesystem: Bug in my patch
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/22/78

In my former posting in the list
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113766834512624&w=2
an important bug has to be corrected, otherwise the number of files is
limited to 65.536 and file corruption can occur.
See the solution in my last post to comp.os.minix:
http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/browse_thread/thread/2bbdeadd8eab0bd0/49077d297f205c69#49077d297f205c69
I am sorry for the inconvenience.
