i don't see how that can be true, given that most of the definitions
of the clear_page() macro are simply invocations of memset().  see for
yourself:
  $ grep -r "#define clear_page" include
my only point here was that lots of code seems to be calling memset()
when it would be clearer to invoke clear_page().  but there's still
something a bit curious happening here.  i'll poke around a bit more
before i ask, though.
