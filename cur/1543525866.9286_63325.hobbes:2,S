Found these messages on my SMP system running 2.3.45:
TW_REC: reject openreq 45964658/10904516 affdb9d1/15157
TW_REC: reject openreq 45964658/10904816 affdb9d1/15157
TW_REC: reject openreq 45964658/10905416 affdb9d1/15157
They appear to come from line 1385 of tcp_ipv4.c.  The system doesn't
appear to have been harmed.
Looking around some more, it also recieved these messages over the last
several days while running 2.3.41.
