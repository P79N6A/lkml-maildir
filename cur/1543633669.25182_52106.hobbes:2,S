Subject: [PATCH] 2.4 add __dma_buffer alignment macro
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Following up on the "PCI DMA to small buffers on cache-incoherent
arch" discussion, here is a patch that adds <asm/dma_buffer.h>, which
contains a __dma_buffer alignment macro for DMA into buffers in the
middle of structures.
I only implemented for i386 and ppc, I don't know enough about other
architectures to get them right.
Thanks,
  Roland

 networking subsystems make sure that the buffers they use are valid
 for you to DMA from/to.
 
+Note that on non-cache-coherent architectures, having a DMA buffer
+that shares a cache line with other data can lead to memory
+corruption.  The __dma_buffer macro defined in <asm/dma_buffer.h>
+exists to allow safe DMA buffers to be declared easily and portably as
+part of larger structures without causing bloat on cache-coherent
+architectures.  Of course these structures must be contained in memory
+that can be used for DMA as described above.
+
+To use __dma_buffer, just declare a struct like:
+
+	struct mydevice {
+		    int field1;
+		    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE] __dma_buffer;
+		    int field2;
+	};
+	
+If this is used in code like:
+
+	struct mydevice *dev;
+	dev = kmalloc(sizeof *dev, GFP_KERNEL);
+
+then dev->buffer will be safe for DMA on all architectures.  On a
+cache-coherent architecture the members of dev will be aligned exactly
+as they would have been without __dma_buffer; on a non-cache-coherent
+architecture buffer and field2 will be aligned so that buffer does not
+share a cache line with any other data.

 Does your device have any DMA addressing limitations?  For example, is
