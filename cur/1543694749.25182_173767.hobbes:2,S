I have an Epox 8k5a3+ with 2 Maxtor drives (80GB) connected. It't running
fine, from 2.4.18-ac* kernels (currently 2.4.23-pre7-pac2). I haven't seen
any problems, the disks are mirrored (md driver), ext3, reiserfs, xfs and jfs
filesystems are on the disks. (I have very bad experiences with HTP372 and
80GB Maxtor drives)
