[Warning -- another oldtimer reminiscence]
Could be worse -- much worse.  I well recall the banner messages saying
"P-files created after suchandsuch-a-datetime have been lost" because our
KRONOS system had crashed, and KRONOS only flushed filesystem metadata to
disk on manual intervention from the console.  It didn't happen every day,
but sometimes it sure seemed like that.

Innovation is only valuable if it improves one's life; otherwise it's
just one more silly change to cope with.
