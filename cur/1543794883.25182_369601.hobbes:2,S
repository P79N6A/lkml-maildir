Reiser4 does I believe...

I was not talking about Solaris/UFS.  NTFS has named streams and extended 
attributes and both are stored as separate attribute records inside the 
same inode as the data attribute.  (A bit simplified as multiple inodes 
can be in use for one "file" when an inode's attributes become large than 
an inode - in that case attributes are either moved whole to a new inode 
and/or are chopped up in bits and each bit goes to a different inode.)
