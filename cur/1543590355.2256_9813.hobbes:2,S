Urban:
I am actually using a 2.4.3 kernel, rather than 2.4.4. However, I 
manually applied the patches to my 2.4.3 kernel, and did some tests - 
it appears to work now!
I probably won't be using Samba heavily until next week, but I will let 
you know if I see any evidence that the problem is not fixed.
Thank you very much for the fix.
