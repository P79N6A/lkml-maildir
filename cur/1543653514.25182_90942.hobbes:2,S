Your patch won't work if CONFIG_LBD is on.  I haven't seen this bug
reported since the raid0_mergeable_bvec() function went in.
Are you not using power-of-two sized chunks?  If not, use the
sector_div() macro to do the remainder, not a direct remainder
operation (which will fail to link if CONFIG_LBD on IA32)
You could try ... (untested)
