How about some numbers which contrast your claims?  Here are the diff
sizes for all the changes in Linus' BK tree.  Note that he is importing
patches which may actually be bigger than your typical checkin, but
no matter, the point stands even if they represent exactly one checkin
per patch.
In this tree, at least, a typical delta is less than .63% of the file
size.  And if you are measuring against the revision history size, 
then your numbers are even more off.
