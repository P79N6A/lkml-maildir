I bet!  My (false) assumption was the same as Goswin's.  If non-movable
pages are clearly seperated from movable ones and will evict movable
ones before polluting further mixed superpages, Nick's scenario would be
nearly infinitely impossible.
Assumption doesn't reflect current code.  Enforcing this assumption
would cost extra overhead.  The amount of effort to make Christoph's
approach work reliably seems substantial and I have no idea whether it
would be worth it.
