Noise can be filtered out, and combined attacks can give enough information.
(E.g. throw in power usage or other measurements.) There are ways to add
noise to the timing, but still using those optimisations. The point was
that they add extra code and complexity.
(Personally I think RSA-like asymmetric encryption has so many, often
subtle problems, with complex, hard to get secure implementations, that
it's something I'd avoid using as much as possible. Unfortunately there's
not much alternative.)

That's because for side-channel attacks you need physical access to the
hardware, something for most machines means security is breached anyway.
But when this code is going to be used to sign things by embedded devices
(with a local, secret key), it can be important.
For checking signatures the key is known and all this doesn't matter, but
we're talking about a common implementation. It are things to keep in mind.

We won't know until those users show themselves. Until then, we can only
speculate. Right now there is only user, with another one lurking in the
background.
