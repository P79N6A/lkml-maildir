Disk is actually less likely to be a problem than PCI bus bandwidth - the
older VIA boards seem quite happy to fill the PCI bus solid during bursts
of disk I/O

You might want to try the reverse if you have a UDMA100 or UDMA133 drive
then setting the speed down to UDMA66 definitely evens out the behaviour
of VIA boards when doing video capture. I don't know if it helps playback.
