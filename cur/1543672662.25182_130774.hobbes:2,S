Hi Andrew & Alan,
Sorry for the delay but the one liner below does seem to have cleared up
the issue. I have been running it for about eight hours, with some sound
on all the time, and haven't seen any 'nobody cared' messages.
BTW: I hand applied this to 2.5.69-mm1. So I am confident that this one
liner did fix it.
