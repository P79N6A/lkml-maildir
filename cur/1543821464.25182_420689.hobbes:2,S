The other problem is that readpages has no idea about the layout
of the disk so just doing it dumbly might end up with a lot of seeking.
I suppose you would at least need some tweaks to the scheduler to make
sure it doesn't give these reads any priority and keeps them in the
queue long enough to get real good sorting and large requests.
Problem is that this would likely need to be asynchronous to be any
useful unless you were willing to block a thread for a potentially
long time for each file to be prefetched.
