Hopefully with this idea in place, we can spot new syscalls before
the final release of the kernel (maybe kautobuild can help there)
and fix any silly system call argument ordering which requires
different architectures to have different syscall prototypes (eg,
sys_arm_fadvise64_64 vs sys_fadvise64_64, sys_arm_sync_file_range vs
sys_sync_file_range).
Otherwise the SYSCALLS.def file will probably end up being full of
ifdefs.
