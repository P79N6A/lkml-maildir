Subject: [PATCH] 2.2.17pre9 interactiveness under high IO

Hi,
Under 2.2.17pre9, a process trying to free memory itself will queue IO
request(s) in case it finds a page which contain dirty buffers.
The problem is that this process will block in case the request queue is
full (high IO workloads), and wait until it finds a free request on the
queue.
This silly patch avoids that by making ll_rw_block() ignore the IO if the
request queue is full, causing the process to search for more freeable
pages instead blocking.
This patch does not affect stability with the huge MAP_SHARED case. 
(note that I've tested this patch together with Andrea's
balance_dirty_state patch which causes kswapd to be waken up correctly. 
This means if you try to run it with stock 2.2.17pre9 the huge MAP_SHARED
case may fail).
