It's not a matter of how often I start tracing, but more about what
impact I want this operation to have on a running production system. If
I start tracing on a server to try detecting particularly nasty race
conditions, I prefer not to interfere with the normal execution too
much. The same applies when we try to figure out the source of some
unexpected latencies experienced in user-space : stopping the processes
could be considered as having too much impact on the system studied.
I was already reluctant about iterating on every thread to set a flag
(this was proposed by Martin and Rebecca, in their Google ktrace
implementation), but I accepted to go forward this solution because of
the performance benefits. However, I would prefer not to go as far as
stopping each process on the system upon trace start/stop to perform
this unless it's the only solution left.

Do you mean architectures other than x86_64 could also assume that the
thread flags will stay unchanged between two consecutive reads ? If
those thread flags were meant not to be asynchronously updated, why
would they require an atomic update at all ?

Agreed. ptrace seems to be correct as is. It would only be needed if we
plan to use the flags as I described TIF_KERNEL_TRACE.
