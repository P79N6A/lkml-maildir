I have rewritten sb_card.c for use with the new pnp and modules interface.
I'll get you a copy soon, my ISP has gone out of business and I've been
without access for a few weeks now.
I have also a patch to the rest of the oss soundblaster driver to make it
use safe interfaces so that it can be unloaded.
