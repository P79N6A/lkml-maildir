EMBEDDED is just a switch to enable configuration options related to
removing 'core' features of the kernel to save space. Think of it as a
safety to avoid accidentally turning off something important. Feel
free to switch on EMBEDDED if you want to use CONFIG_PROCESSOR_SELECT
- just enabling EMBEDDED doesn't do anything by itself.
