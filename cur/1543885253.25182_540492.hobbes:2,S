Tried and this one work right. A single flush is sufficient to
completely flush the input buffer. Again, thanks a lot :).
Now I don't want to abuse your kindness, but I (personally) would be
*really* interested in a similar fix for the FTDI usb-serial driver,
because many measurements I do use an FTDI device.
However, if I understood well seems that many drives have to be
checked against this problem.
