Indeed. But I am not the one who originally wrote the patch. I only 
fixed a null-pointer dereference in the original patch, updated for a 
new kernel version, and resubmitted. For me, to do what you suggest, 
requires better understanding of the existing code. I will try, though, 
when I get better time.
