The idea looks good, but the amount of code duplication is ugly.
What about creating an include/linux/atomic.h [1] that contains both 
this new code and other common code like the atomic_t typedef (unless 
there's a good reason why counter isn't volatile on h8300 and v850...).

[1] include/asm-generic/atomic.h would be another solution, but for
    an API that should be available on all architectures, include/linux/
    seems to be the more logical place
