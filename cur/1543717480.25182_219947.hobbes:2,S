Thanks for the report.  Yes, this has been reported already to me but I 
didn't get a response from the other person yet, so perhaps you could
help...  Note that this works fine on my P4 with SuSE Linux
(gcc-3.3.3-36 rpm and binutils 2.15.90.0.1.1-26 rpm) and it works fine
for many other people...
Which binutils version do you have (rpm -q binutils)?
Can you type (inside the configured kernel tree):
make fs/ntfs/logfile.s
And email this file to me.  Line 683 of that file should give us a clue
why this is failing.
Thanks a lot in advance.
Best regards,
	Anton
