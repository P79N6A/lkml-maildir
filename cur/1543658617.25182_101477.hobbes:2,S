Thanks. Wasn't it there before?

Good point, but it works quite well already because prefixes in 
source code tend to be clustered (everything in a file called
subsystem_foo etc.). Sorting by name may improve it even more.
Unfortunately these functions are not as performance critical
as previously thought. At least some versions of top read /proc/<pid>/wchan
now and that will always walk the full symbol table for each
address on the stack (in short it is very very costly) 
(I guess it would be a good idea to at least make it root readable 
only to prevent users from tying up too much cpu time in kernel) 
With the strncpy that got added in 2.5.55 it got even more costly,
because due to a stupid definition it will always zero upto 127 bytes.
So the choice would be either to fix top to not do that or 
do binary search or some other efficient search method
(the later would prevent sorting by name). Binary search would
make the stem compression more awkward however because it would
need to scan backwards.
Actually best may be to just get rid of /proc/*/wchan again
and keep the lookup symbol function like it is.
As the top incident shows it is just too dangerous to have around.
And having to press the magic keys on the console isn't that bad...
Comments?
