Subject: [PATCH] 2.2pre2 - very minor doc update

Here's a New Year's present for the penguins. :) This patch fixes two things:
(a) The comments for Configure.help mention 2.1.x at the top and have a
disclaimer for developmental kernels. I changed the reference to 2.2.x and
removed the disclaimer, since 2.2.0 will be a stable kernel and 2.0.35 (and
presumably other 2.0.xx kernels) doesn't have the disclaimer.
(b) There was a typo in the help for the AHA-1740 driver (an extra zero in
"aha1740.o"). I've corrected this.
I hope this patch will make it into 2.2.0 final, because it's really minor
(IMO)...
