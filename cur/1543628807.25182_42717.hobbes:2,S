Which BIOS version was the problem found on? I've got one of these,
and the original 1004 Award BIOS didn't give this problem, nor does
the 1005A BIOS I upgraded to.
However, I am having memory problems. Anyone else got similar
experiences (or good experiences)? I got 3 of 1 GiB DDR266 ECC Reg
DIMMs (36 chips apiece) and a 512 MiB DDR266 ECC Unbuf DIMM (18
chips). I have various problems:
- none of the DIMMs are reported by the BIOS as ECC, whether plugged
  in together or separately
- plugging in one 1 GiB DIMM will sometimes yield a bit error with
  memtest86 test #1
- plugging in two 1 GiB DIMMs will yield a bit error in test #1
- plugging in three 1 GiB DIMMs will yield a stream of bit errors in
  test #1 (and possibly other tests, but I gave up before then).
The vendor claims the 1 GiB DIMMs are compatible with the A7M266-D,
but when I received the M/B and DIMMs, I noted the motherboard manual
said it only supported DIMMs with up to 18 chips each, and of course
the 1 GiB DIMMs have 36 chips each :-(
According to Asus tech support 18 chip 1 GiB DIMMs are not available
yet. When I asked why they claimed support for 1 GiB DIMMs, they said
"for the future". Argh! Anybody know if 18 chip 1 GiB DDR DIMMs are
available anywhere?
