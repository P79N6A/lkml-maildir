It won't work reliably unless some of the c_p_a() fixes get in first.

No externs in .c files
I also don't like kernel_text_is_read_only() much, it would
be better to just lookup_address() it and check the write flag.
But for 2.6.22 as a quick fix it might be better to just
make KPROBES dependent on !DEBUG_RODATA. That would be a one liner.
