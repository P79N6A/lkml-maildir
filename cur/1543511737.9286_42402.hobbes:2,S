I just installed redhat 6.1 on my laptop and since a 2.2 kernel
is on (not for very long), the problem returned.
It seems that no interrupts are generated when keys are pressed,
however a programmatic cure is to do "setleds +caps < /dev/tty1"
Does that provide a clue to anyone as to what the problem might
be?
