Certainly in 2.4.18 (and I've seen a pile of other similar reports).

Long time ago -its been behaving well until fairly recently

Oldish firmware definitely. The newer driver finds the card registers
it but fails on all tx/rx and reports no signal and noise of
130/150 or so (as opposed to db). Flipping back to the older kernel it
works happily. 
Any specific info/debug/traces that would help ?
