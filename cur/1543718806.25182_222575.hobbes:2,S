What I'm missing in this discussion is a clear distinction between patches and 
contributions.
A patch is usually a more or less small fix / improvement of existing code and 
should be treated accordingly. Recording "signed-off" chains for those would  
just using up repository space and could be used just for another type of 
useless statistics. 
Contributions are larger pieces of code introducing new functionalities or 
algorithms and contain probably stuff which could be classified as 
"Intellectual Property" and therefor Linus' proposal is surely appropriate.
I'm not sure how to distinguish exactly between patches and contributions, but 
I'm not convinced, that
- (if x > 0)
+ (if x >= 0)
signed-off hacker
signed-off module-maintainer
signed-off subsystem-maintainer
signed-off linus / andrea /...
would really be helpful and desired.

If the manager or who ever ensures by signing off that this code is according 
to the submission rules, then it should be sufficient for the maintainer.
