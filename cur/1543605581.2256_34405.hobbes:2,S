You are thinking the small picture not the big one. If you are going to
graphical in init then you want to make full use of the graphical
environment to clearly show things like parallel fsck behaviour, what
servers are starting up (with pretty icons) and to do interactive things 
like starting a rescue shell, going single user, pausing the boot,
changing run level, interactive boot.
