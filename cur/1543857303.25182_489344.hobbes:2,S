It is no doubt that the above data is just a quick estimate on one
usage model. There are tons of other usage in the world.  After all,
any algorithm in the kernel has to be generic and self tune to
specific environment.
On very large I/O, the relative overhead in allocating biovec will
decrease because larger I/O needs more code to do setup, more code
to perform I/O completion, more code in the device driver etc. So
time spent on one mempool alloc will amortize over the size of I/O.
On a smaller I/O size, the overhead is more visible and thus makes
sense to me to cut down that relative overhead.
In fact, the large I/O already have unfair advantage.  If you do 1MB
I/O, only 1 call to mempool to get a 256 segment bio.  However if you
do two 512K I/O, two calls to mempool is made.  So in some sense,
current scheme is unfair to small I/O.
