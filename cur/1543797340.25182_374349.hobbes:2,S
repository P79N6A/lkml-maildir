not on my fujitsu sonoma/ih6 based laptop it doesn't.  in my travels trying to
fix this problem it appears there are many others it doesnt work for either. 
suspend/resume is incredibly important for day-to-day practical use of a laptop,
particularly using linux. the sole reason i still have a windows partition is
because suspend doesnt work in linux and i'm sick of firing everything up again
3 times a day.
thank you very much to all on this list who are pursuing a solution sensibly and
not making unhelpful blanket statements against the most widely used laptop
chipset maker - *particularly* when they are actively contributing to
development on this list.  we (laptop users) dont care about religious
standpoints, we just want it to work.
