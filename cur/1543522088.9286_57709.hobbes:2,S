 Yeah, I reported this a few months ago.  modversions is built is a
screwy way, and is NOT 'make -jn' safe, which means the 'dep' target
must NOT have -jn option on make.  
 parallel compiles with make dep really doesn't give much benefit,
compared to the default target, so there's not much loss here....
 make -jn bzImage is OK though, which is the only place we really
benefit from -jn.
