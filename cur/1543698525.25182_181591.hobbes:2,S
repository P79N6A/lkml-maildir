Do you think that motherboard maker was really at fault or
did they genuinely fix a grotesque error. Were any changes
in the BIOS-change-list relevant to fixing up this APIC
problem in Linux?
Can you provide the following:
- which motherboard
- which bios revs (the broken one and the fixed one)
- which kernel are you running (is it vanilla, from a dist,
recompiled)
- lspci
- cat /proc/interrupts
- dmesg
- .config from kernel (if not stock from dist)
I really, really hope this problem can be solved without
a BIOS upgrade because getting board manufacturers to do
anything is very difficult.
