It was one of the speakers during the presentation.  He seemed to know
what he was talking about, in fact, I was caught so off guard by the
statement, I got up and ask him the question again. "Did you say that
the backlight of the laptop takes up more energy than when it is on?"
and he replied "yes"!
I rememeber this being in room C (could be wrong, I went to so many
sessions).  Looking at the program, it could have been "Linux Power
Management" by Patrick Mochel. But I honestly don't remember which
session it was. (I'm CCing him to see if he can clear things up :-)
