As a co-admin of university server...
Yes, I want users to see what each other user is doing. That way, if
someone hacks one account, some other user can notice and tell me.
In some environments it may make sense not to allow users to chmod
their $HOMEs (so that they can't hide mp3's etc), but we are not
*that* stupid/paranoid ;-).
