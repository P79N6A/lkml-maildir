Not exactly a real solution. Perhaps something should be done to give
pseudo-VBE2.0 functionality to VBE1.2 boards on boot. ie something to muck
about with the video card before the kernel loads. OTOH, this would
probably not be a kernel-space issue. (IOW, it could be done either as a
separate utility, or as an add-on to lilo).
