You know Andi, I was imagining something like bitmap or linked list of
all per_cpu vars (dynamically updated) and just going through this
list... Or something like that (maybe some registration mechanism).
There are not too many of them - about two dozens, mostly all sorts of
accounting.

Exactly - such as on ES7000, it can support 32, 64, 128 etc. processors
depending on what configuration the customer actually ordered :)... it
should be something for that, then NR_CPUS could be either defined as
boot parameter or belong to subarchs.
Thanks,
