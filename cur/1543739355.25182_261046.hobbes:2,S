I really don't think we want a comment by every mmiowb() explaining what
it does.  We needed one by the write flush because it had two potential

is clear and unambiguous.

himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
