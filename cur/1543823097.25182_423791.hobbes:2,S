It does in most of the cases. Take for example
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/13/145.
 KMemLeak detects it if the leak
happened, i.e. parse_num32 returns a non-zero value and kfree(name)
isn't present. When scanning the memory, the value of the name pointer
won't be found and therefore the block is shown as orphan.
I did similar tests to the above bug and it detected them in 90% of
the cases. However, I haven't done tests with objects reusing. I need
to write more comprehensive tests.

I think I got it now. You mean that the value of a leaked pointer
could be found in other structures that previously used that object.
Anyway, I considered it a kernel bug if an invalid pointer remains in
a valid data structure. The latter would need to be freed as well and,
in this case, kmemleak won't scan it. I don't expect to have many
cases like this but, well, I haven't read the whole source.

That's indeed an interesting idea. It has some difficulties as well
since you can only remap at the page level and a lot of virtual space
would be used (some way to compact consecutive blocks in one remapped
page would be needed).
Another improvement (but not enough) would be to zero the pointer
passed to kmem_cache_free (detecting at compilation time if it is
non-constant).
The tool can also be extended to track where the allocated blocks are
referred from and check whether those values are still in valid
structures after the blocks were freed.
Thanks for suggestions. They are really useful.
