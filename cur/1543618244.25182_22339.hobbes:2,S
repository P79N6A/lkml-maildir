the two patches are not quite equivalent. if i now try to reverse the
patch i get two failures:
patching file net/ipv4/icmp.c
Hunk #3 FAILED at 495.
1 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file net/ipv4/icmp.c.rej
patching file net/ipv4/ipconfig.c
patching file net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_standalone.c
patching file net/ipv6/icmp.c
Unreversed patch detected!  Ignore -R? [n] 
Apply anyway? [n] 
Skipping patch.
1 out of 1 hunk ignored -- saving rejects to file net/ipv6/icmp.c.rej
patching file net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c
i think i'll download a pristine 2.4.17 and start again.
