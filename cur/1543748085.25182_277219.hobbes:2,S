How is the gameport_register_port() supposed to be called for USB
devices? There doesn't seem to be any kernel hook for that. Is it
supposed to happen in userspace?
Also, it seems to me that gameport_register_device is always going to
add a null pointer (dev->node) to the gameport_dev_list, and that
doesn't seem terribly useful. What's the purpose of that?
