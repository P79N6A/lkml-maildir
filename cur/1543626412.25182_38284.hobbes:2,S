Hi,
I've got a 1U 2.0 Ghz P4 rackmount server with an i845 chipset and have
noticed some strange issues with the timer. For the most part it keeps
time perfectly... but pretty often (tens of times each day) it'll have
drifted anything from a few seconds to a few minutes - during a 10 minute
period. It's always behind-time - so perhaps this is something to do with
the P4's throttling stuff? Has anyone else seen similar?
I tried to use 2.5.7-dj2 with Zwane Mwaikambo's thermal LVT support in
there but it didn't detect a local APIC on bootup (!) - I'm guessing there
needs to be an APIC for Zwane's stuff? When I tried to switch back to
2.4.18 the machine never came back - as soon as someone power cycles it
then I can do some more tests!
Regards,
Chris
