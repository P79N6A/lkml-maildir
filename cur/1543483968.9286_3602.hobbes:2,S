	A general question non directly related to the kernel.
	We have here at work a group NIS map with ~ 1000 entries.
	To make things go faster (logging, su, ls, etc.), we
	removed 'nisplus' and 'nis' from the group line in
	nsswitch.conf and run :
	$ cp -f /etc/group-orig /etc/group+
	$ ypcat group >>/etc/group+
	$ mv -f /etc/group+ /etc/group
	each time the group NIS map is modified (and regularly
	every night through a cron).
	If we don't do that, each file access last a long time,
	with a lot of request towards our NIS server (Note that
	we have to do that for our FreeBSD, NetBSD, SGI, etc.
	machines, the only machine that deal correctly with
	big NIS map beeing the SunOS and Solaris ones).
	Is there another way to obtain good performance ?
	I thought that ypbind with glibc 2.0.7 was OK, but
	it seems not, so we get stuck with our hacky solution.
	Thanks
A+
