It must drop the lock, and that's the problem: I'm quite sure that the
current code could lock up: (The window is tiny, but nevertheless it
should be closed.)
CPU1: in DAC960_ProcessRequest(), owns the io_request_lock.
	CPU2: in DAC960_InterruptHandler
	AcquireControllerLock: spins because the io_request_lock is blocked.
DAC960_AllocateCommand(): returns NULL, no free Command struct
spin_unlock(&io_request_lock);
<the local NMI interrupt occurs and enlarges the window between
spin_unlock() and sleep_on()>
	DAC960_InteruptHandler can continue.
	calls DAC960_ProcessCompletedCommand().
	<at the end of this function:>
	DAC960_DeallocateCommand();
	wake_up(&Controller->CommandWaitQueue);
	<the wait queue is empty, nothing to do>
<the local NMI returns>
sleep_on()
<adds this thread to the wait queue>
<sets current->state=TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE>
<sleeps>
As you'll notice, the wakeup from CPU2 is lost, the free command
structure is not used. [At least this is what I understand from
the DAC driver, please correct me if I'm wrong.]
I think you should replace 
- spin_unlock(&io_request_lock);
- sleep_on(&CommandWaitQueue);
- spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
with something like:
+ add_wait_queue(&CommandWaitQueue);
+ current->state= TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
+ spin_unlock(&io_request_lock);
+ schedule();
+ remove_wait_queue(&CommandWaitQueue);
+ spin_lock_irq(&io_request_lock);
A sample function would be __get_request_wait() in ll_rw_blk.c, or
__wait_on_buffer() in fs/buffer.c
