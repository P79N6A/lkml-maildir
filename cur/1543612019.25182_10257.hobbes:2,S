Right, I meant just the spin_lock_irq case, which would be fine except
for the case where:
spin_lock_irq
spin_unlock
restore_irq
to solve this, we need a spin_unlock_irq_on macro that didn't touch the
preemption count.

Ah, another optimization wrt preempt count.  This goes further than just
making spin_lock_irqsave not touch the preempt count, in that it also
let's us say (this lock is _always_ nested inside another, we don't need
to touch the preempt count).
It would apply anywhere we grab multiple locks and drop the first one
last.

Right.

I offered that idea and George convinced me otherwise :)
