Why do you apparently ignore the fact that page-out write-back performance
is horribly crappy because it always starts out doing synchronous writes?
I pointed out previously in a private email that page_launder() must be
buggy as it stands now, you seem to have ignored that part (and the
test-program that shows 1MB/s writeout speeds due to it) completely.
The whole _point_ of the new VM was performance. Without that, the new VM
is pointless, and discussing TODO features is equally pointless.
