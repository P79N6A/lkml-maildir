The first boot will need to hold a copy of the in memory fs for the
second boot.  This image can be large (much larger than the kernel),
hence we can save time when the memory loader is slow.  Also, it reduces
the memory footprint while extracting the first boot since you don't
need another copy of the fs.
New patch on it's way.
