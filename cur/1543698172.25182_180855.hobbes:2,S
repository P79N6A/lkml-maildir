Subject: Oops w/sysfs when closing a disconnected usb serial device

With 2.6.0-test11, I get a panic if I disconnect a USB serial device with
a fd open on it and then close the fd.  When the device is disconnected,
usb_disconnect calls usb_disable_device, which calls device_del, which
calls kobject_del, which removes the device's sysfs directory.  If a user
space program has the tts device open, then kobject_cleanup and
destroy_serial do not get called until the device is closed, but by then
the kobject_del call to the interface has caused the tty device's sysfs
directory to be nuked from under it.  Eventually sysfs_remove_dir is
called and eventually calls simple_rmdir with a dentry with a NULL
d_inode, causing an oops.  I can make the Oops go away with the following
patch:
