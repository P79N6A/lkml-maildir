I strongly believe this BUG_ON() is indeed wrong, and I did a similar patch
a long ago:
	[PATCH] posix-timers: remove false BUG_ON() from run_posix_cpu_timers()
	Commit 3de463c7d9d58f8cf3395268230cb20a4c15bffa
However it was reverted due to some unclear problems (I think those problems
were not related to this patch).
Instead this patch was added:
	[PATCH] Yet more posix-cpu-timer fixes
	Commit 3de463c7d9d58f8cf3395268230cb20a4c15bffa
and I still think this patch is not correct.
