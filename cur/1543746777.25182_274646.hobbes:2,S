Do you think looks like it may be a CPU scheduling or disk/fs artifact?
Neither user nor system time are significantly worse, while the vanilla
kernel is using a lot more of the CPUs' power (ie waiting for IO less,
or becoming idle less often due to CPU scheduler balancing).
Aside: under-load conditions like this is actually something where the
CPU scheduler doesn't do brilliantly at currently. I attribute this to
probably most "performance tests" loading it up as much as possible.
I am (on and off) looking at improving performance in these conditions,
and am making some inroads.
