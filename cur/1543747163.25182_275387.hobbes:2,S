I'm in control of "one" of the network segments, the other is connected 
to the internet which is a bad source of entropy I know, so I've enabled 
the SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM in the request_irq() call just for my local lan 
nic, but the "other" source of good entropy should be the DAC(RAID) 
controller, right?, I was just curious about why this driver didn't had 
this flag enabled in its request_irq call.
