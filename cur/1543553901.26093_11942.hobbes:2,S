The last time I looked at your code, I stopped reading after I got

There is nothing stopping us from doing that now, we just choose not to,
as it would result in a ridiculously oversized kernel. Even if the loader
threw away the non-used segments, I don't think anyone can justify an
on-disk kernel image containing mostly code they never execute.
