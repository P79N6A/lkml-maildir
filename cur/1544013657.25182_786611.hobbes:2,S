For resource pointers it's not uncommon.  There are many cases when it's perfectly
ok for a resource pointer to be null, e.g. res->parent is often null, pci devices
and busses don't usually have all possible ranges, etc.  It nice to get decent info
printouts without having the check for NULL pointers.
