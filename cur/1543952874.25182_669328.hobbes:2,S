I don't know off hand of something that cares.  (I have a test case, but
it's just contrived for the purpose.)  Something like UML could use this to
approximate PTRACE_SYSEMU when it's not there.  But we would have heard
before now if UML cared about this particular behavior on x86_64.

No hurry.  It's been broken forever (regression vs native 32-bit).
(OTOH, the fixes are quite safe.)
Thanks,
