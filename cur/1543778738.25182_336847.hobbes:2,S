 It is the first mail that I write. I call gabri and I am 18 years old. I am
 Spanish. I want to comment that me program does not work ningun to regulate
 the Mhz of the processor. " Cpufreq, cpuydn, powernow ". I do not manage to
 load ningun module from the kernel inside cpuscalig in that it(he,she)
 fences with an amd mobile sempron.
 The modules of athlon do not go.
 Do they work to give support to the mobile sempron in the future versions 
of
 the kernel?
 what can I do ?
