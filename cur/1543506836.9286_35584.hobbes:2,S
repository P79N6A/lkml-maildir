Subject: re-exporting an nfs mount point makes it empty... why?

Is there an easy way to make this work?
Under Red Hat 5, I could mount a CDROM via the -o loop option and
then make it available via NFS.
Under Red Hat 6, with the kernel nfs, I cannot do this... is
there a mount option I can use, or is knfsd just not able to do this?
Thanks,
Mark
