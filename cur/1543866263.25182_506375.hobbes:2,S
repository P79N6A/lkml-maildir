Problem with this approach is it may break distro/initrd setups since 
the pata_amd driver appears to be the one that "should" work based on 
the PCI ID, so the initrd would end up containing only this driver, 
which will fail out with -ENODEV and cause a boot failure. If the root 
filesystem was on a disk driven by this controller, the mkinitrd stuff 
would have to "know" that it should also try loading pata_acpi.
Unless there are some Nvidia boxes out there which don't provide 
_GTM/_STM ACPI methods (which seems a bit unlikely given Allen Martin's 
comments) then we could potentially move the Nvidia PATA PCI IDs into 
the pata_acpi driver, at least if ACPI is enabled in the kernel build..
