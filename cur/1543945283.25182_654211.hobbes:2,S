I'll take a look...  if its checkpatch stuff I caused, I'm happy to fix it.
But I'm trying to avoid cleanups for pre-existing conditions, i.e. 
flagged by checkpatch only because I moved existing code to a new location.
Down that path lies madness and way too much work :)  I didn't sign on 
to clean up ISDN :)
Anyway, thanks for the multiple comments, they will be taken into 
account in the next update of these patches.
