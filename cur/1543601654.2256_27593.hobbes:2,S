I had a SINGLE report of different CPU's doing different things, but 
*most* people aren't swapping different chips into the same motherboard 
very often, so all the people without the problem might have the problem 
when they put in a different CPU, and those with the problem might have 
it go away if they put in a different CPU. I can only assume that this 
BIOS bug is only triggered under certain conditions of the CPU.
