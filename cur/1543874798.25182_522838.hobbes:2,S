Meh, it's only a cheesy debug thing, so it's not really that big a deal imo.
it could probably move to debugfs (we didn't have that when it was merged iirc)
I doubt anyone really cares enough to bother though I wouldn't
be averse to a patch.
To the best of my knowledge, nothing in userspace is relying on that stuff
being present (it'd have to cope with it not being there anyway given its
optional).
