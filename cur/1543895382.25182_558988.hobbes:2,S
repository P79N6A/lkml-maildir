how about the patch below? Boot-tested on 32-bit. As a side-effect this 
change also removes the 255 CPUs limit from the 32-bit kernel.

Subject: [patch] x86: fix spin-loop starvation bug
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
Miklos Szeredi reported very long pauses (several seconds, sometimes
more) on his T60 (with a Core2Duo) which he managed to track down to
wait_task_inactive()'s open-coded busy-loop. He observed that an
interrupt on one core tries to acquire the runqueue-lock but does not
succeed in doing so for a very long time - while wait_task_inactive() on
the other core loops waiting for the first core to deschedule a task
(which it wont do while spinning in an interrupt handler).
The problem is: both the spin_lock() code and the wait_task_inactive()
loop uses cpu_relax()/rep_nop(), so in theory the CPU should have
guaranteed MESI-fairness to the two cores - but that didnt happen: one
of the cores was able to monopolize the cacheline that holds the
runqueue lock, for extended periods of time.
This patch changes the spin-loop to assert an atomic op after every REP
NOP instance - this will cause the CPU to express its "MESI interest" in
that cacheline after every REP NOP.
