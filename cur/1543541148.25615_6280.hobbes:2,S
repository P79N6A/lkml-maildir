That's just not true.  handle_sysrq now exits without action if
sysrq_enabled == 0.  In fact the only reason it's a global variable is
because sysctl requires it - hopefully that will be fixed in 2.5 (ELF
section based sysctl).

But it doesn't compile, does it ?  (there should be no visible definition
for sysrq_enabled in serial.c)
