Hi,
I confirm Peter's observations:

This is the correct setup to trigger the bug. And the commit
6f5391c283d7fdcf24bf40786ea79061919d1e1d has nothing to do with this
bug. It was bad luck that i couldn't trigger the bug with said commit
reverted (in my tests, the second boot with the reverted commit missed
the first mount/umount smaller cd step, so...)
So sorry for all the mess and stress.
I'm glad that Peter found the real nature of this bug.
