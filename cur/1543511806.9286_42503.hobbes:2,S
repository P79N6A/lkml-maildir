Eh? The config is in /boot/config-xx.yy.zz, the version information is in
/proc/version. The correct kernel headers are provided either by having the
full kernel source, or just a kernel headers package.
The reason for *not* symlinking /usr/include/{asm,linux} to
/usr/src/linux/include/.. is discussed in excrutiating detail in 
/usr/lib/kernel-package/README.headers, from the Debian kernel-package
package; I can mail it to you if you'd like.
