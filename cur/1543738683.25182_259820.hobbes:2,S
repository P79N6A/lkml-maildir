It certainly fits for Pavel, but, I do have things slightly different,
so that don't have the maximum-image-size-is-half-of-RAM problem. At the
moment I do:
quiesce system & prepare metadata
suspend devices not used for writing the image or user I/O (this is just
seeking to remove any chance of them allocating memory, which might
strangle writing the image)
write LRU pages ('pageset 2')
suspend used devices
save CPU context & make atomic copy of remaining pages
resume used devices
save image
power down used devices
power down system/enter S4.
This is why I made that 'device tree' patch - so I could separate the
devices used for writing the image from those unused and treat them
separately. I'm pretty sure that I could get away with leaving the
unused ones alone until snapshot time, but it seems more ideal to me to
get them to save state and power down at the start, especially if you're
trying to suspend when the battery is low!
At the very least, I'd like to see that 'snapshot' state implemented
separately to the 'powerdown' state.

Okay. I've only looked at the ACPI spec occasionally, and have generally
just followed the lead of Patrick and Pavel in implementing ACPI support
in s-t-d.

:> I'm confused by all these changes; no wonder drivers are!
