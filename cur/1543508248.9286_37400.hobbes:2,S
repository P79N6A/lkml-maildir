I sent a message containing a new masquerading patch to these lists, and
it was way too large at least for linux-kernel. I'm sending this message
to clarify. The necessary files are at 
http://mail.helixsystems.com/~masq/
Also, in case you got the original message, the mbfw.c and ip_masq_mbfw.c
files were an old version. Don't use them. Use the ones from the web site.
original text follows (more or less)

 The following patch is a new version of the 2-dir masq patch I submitted
 to the kernel list about two months ago. It works very differently this
 time:
 packets coming in on 2-dir connections are marked with an skb flag, which
 is interpreted in the forward chain to force masquerading of that packet,
 with a second entry created for the other masq direction, also with the
 2-dir flag set. Everything is defined out so that it can be a kernel
 compile option.
 The other patch is to ip_masq_app (the app support) and allows modules to
 key into the system by source port rather than dest port, so it works for
 servers behind a firewall being accessed from outside. This is also
 controlled by a #define. The FTP module has code to support masqing of
 passive FTP.
 While I was at it, I fixed a serious problem in the FTP module wherein it
 assumes the TCP data begins after the TCP header with no options in
 between. The following is a Bad Thing:
 data = (char *)&th[1];
 this is the Right Thing:
 data = (char *)th;
 data += th->doff*4;
 ...assuming that proper bounds checking is also being performed which it
 is here. This fix is not #defined; it is included regardless of the
 options set. The problem affected the passive FTP specifically, but it is
 a bug no matter which way it is sliced.
 There's one bug in this patch - the tcp/udp checksum code in masq is
 conditioned out if the 2-dir option is enabled, because it wasn't working
 the second time through. This is a bug somewhere, but I need someone to
 explain to me exactly what it's doing and what all the checksum-related
 fields in the skb are... thanks.
 Oh yes: this _has_ been tested under pretty heavy load. :-)
 Any chance of seeing this in 2.2.1[34]?
 (btw: my employer waives all rights to this code. it's yours.)
