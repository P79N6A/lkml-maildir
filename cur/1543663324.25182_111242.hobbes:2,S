Hadn't run into this - I had been focusing on the readahead and write page
improvements (which have improved especially write performance
spectacularly) and also have just fixed a problem with redundant lookups of
directory inodes but had not been doing readdir (cifs
Trans2FindFirst/Trans2FindNext) testing recently.  I just did - and the
situation looks worse than you describe and probably related to what you
are running into. I found a readdir test case that hangs my post 2.5.62
system pretty fast and the last two unrelated cifs changesets don't fix it.
The cifs readdir code needed some rework anyway - I will crawl through it
today.  Thanks for finding this.
