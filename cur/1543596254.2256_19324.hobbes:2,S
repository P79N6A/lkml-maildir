Subject: Re: alpha - generic_init_pit - why using RTC for calibration?

    Here is the patch against the buggy Cypress RTC which is found on some
Alpha boards. It's tested with 2.2.16 & 2.2.19 kernels and as seems should
work with 2.4.x kernels. This patch differs from initial Ivan's version by
the "cc" variable type & different calibrate divisor usage for better
accuracy.
    Please consider applying this patch against the 2.2.x tree. It's really
needed due to overall performance reasons.
Thanks,
    Oleg.
