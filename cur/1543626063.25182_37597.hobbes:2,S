I thought that the life span of an object is between 
kmem_cache_alloc and kmem_cache_free. If you are expecting caching 
beyond this, you may not get correct data. kmem_cache allocator
is supposed to quickly allocate fixed size structures avoiding
the need for frequent splitting and coalescing in the allocator.
Am I missing something here ?
Thanks
