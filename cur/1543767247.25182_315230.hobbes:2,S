Not nessecarily.  The filesystem gets called into ->get_sb for every mount,
and can then decided whether to return an existing superblock instance or
setup a new one.  If the credentials for the new mount match an old one
it can just reuse it.  (e.g. for block based filesystem it will always reuse
right now)
