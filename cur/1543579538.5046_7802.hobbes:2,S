Yeah, I think that was the one.

Excellent, I didn't pick up on that, with the cursory glance at the code i took.
I wonder, would there be any interest/point in my NETLINK module, which
provides a backward compatible netlink interface. There are a good few
apps out there which rely on it, and its nice not to have to run a daemon
and install a new library, and re-write them just to continue using them...
