Subject: x86 APIC interrupts for UP i810 chipset?

In looking through the i810 docs, it appears to me that the chipset
provides an APIC even for uniprocessor configurations.
Two dumb questions:
Are my eyes deceiving me?  :)
And, does Linux take advantage of these extra i810 interrupts on UP
automatically?
