Why is this a special case? As long as a compiler can't prove that the
computed value of i isn't used later it mustn't optimize it away.
Kernighan/Ritchie (German translation of the second edition) contains the
following example program that shows why the compiler mustn't optimize it
away:
<--  snip  -->
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
  double nc;
  for (nc = 0; getchar() != EOF; ++nc)
	;
  printf("%.0f\n", nc);
}
<--  snip  -->

time explaining its a free country because its a police state.
