First of all, vfat isn't even close to being POSIX. Why worry about one
more little glitch? Normal POSIX filesystems allow "touch me ; mv me mE".
Second of all, you are right about this being an idiotic bug.
Following what seems to be a UNIX tradition (dup2, wait3, wait4),
I propose the fix below. There might also be a "ren" shell builtin
that calls it.
RENAME2(2)           Linux Programmer's Manual           RENAME2(2)
NAME
  rename2 - change the name or location of a file
SYNOPSIS
  #include <unistd.h>
  int rename2(const char *src, const char *dst, unsigned flags);
DESCRIPTION
  The rename2 function renames a file, moving it between directories
  if required. Symbolic links are followed for every path component
  except the last. If the destination already exists, rename2 will fail.
  Directories used as src need not be writable for ".." updates.
  The flags argument modifies rename2 behavior according to these bits:
  R2_CLOBBER
    If dst already exists, unlink it atomically during rename2.
  R2_MKDIR
    Create any directories needed by the dst argument. This includes
    directories which are specified by symbolic links in dst.
  R2_NOSRCLINK
    Do not follow symbolic links for src.
  R2_NODSTLINK
    Do not follow symbolic links for dst.
  R2_SRCLINK
    Follow symbolic links for the last path component of src.
  R2_DSTLINK
    Follow symbolic links for the last path component of dst.
  R2_WINWILD
    Interpret wildcards. This is most useful when files reside on network
    servers that use the SMB protocol, including Samba and Windows shares.
RETURN VALUE
  On success, zero is returned. On error, an error code is returned.
ERRORS
  Blah, blah, blah...
