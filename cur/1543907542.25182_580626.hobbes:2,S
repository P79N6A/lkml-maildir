You are unconditionally taking the i_mutex whether or not you actually
have any capabilities to remove. Normally, removing capabilities due to
a write is something which occurs once every blue moon. Can't you
introduce a heuristic along the lines of should_remove_suid() in order
to optimise away the common case?
In addition, if you need to remove both the capabilities and the suid
bits, then it should be unnecessary to take the i_mutex twice.
