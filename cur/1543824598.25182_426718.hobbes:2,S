Good question, and sorry for mentioning this...
There are some background info here:
        [DISTURBS] section of
        http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112678976802381&w=2
        [DELAYED ACTIVATION] section of
        http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=112679176611006&w=2
It involves a tricky situation where there are two sequential readers
that come close enough, so that the follower retouched the pages
visited by the leader:
          chunk 1         chunk 2               chunk 3
        ==========  =============-------  --------------------
                       follower ^                     leader ^
It is all ok if the revisited pages still stay in the inactive list,
these pages will act as measurement of len(inactive list)/speed(leader).
But if the revisited pages(marked by '=') are sent to active list
immediately, the measurement will no longer be as accurate. The trace
is 'disturbed'. In this case, using page_refcnt() can be aggressive
and unsafe from thrashing, while cold_page_refcnt() can be conservative.
So either one of page_refcnt()/cold_page_refcnt() should be ok, as
long as we know the consequence of this situation.  After all, it is
really uncommon to see much invocation of the context based method,
and even rare for this kind of situation to happen.

Wu
