Whereas my "ultru-thin" VAIO works perfectly with both S2D and S2R and the only thing I have some 
difficulty with is the SD reader. Would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
I often hibernate linux to boot into a hibernated windows session, then go back the other way as 
required, and my machine might do 80-100 "suspend2both" sessions a month between reboots. 30-40 
seconds to suspend mostly (1.5GB of RAM) and about 15 to come back. That's what I call highly useful.
Different strokes and all that I guess..
