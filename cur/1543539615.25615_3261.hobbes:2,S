You can not use that without CAP_SYS_RAW as well.

You missed the point. If you'll block all this with capabilities then you'll
block ability for root to screw the HDD WITHOUT any filtering like Andre's
patch.

Not exactly opposite. Root IS god (it's default). Once root is NOT god it
can not play with hardware as well (and HDIO_DRIVE_CMD must be disable in
this case - this IS small bug in current kernel) and thus can not screw
your HDD. Without filtering and all such crap.
