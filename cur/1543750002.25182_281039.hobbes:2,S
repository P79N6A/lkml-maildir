I suspect it's even worse.
Think about it; you can spew 4k of zeroes into your L1 cache really fast
(assuming your cpu is smart enough to avoid write-allocate for rep
stosl; not sure which cpus are). I suspect you can do that faster than a
cachemiss or two. And at that point the page is cache hot... so reads
don't miss either.
all this makes me wonder if there is any scenario where this thing will
be a gain, other than cpus that aren't smart enough to avoid the write-
allocate.
