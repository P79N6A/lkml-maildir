Subject: [2.6 patch] fs/nfs/direct.c: remove dead code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/11/253

This code became dead after commit b9148c6b80d802dbc2a7530b29915a80432e50c7
(which BTW doesn't seem to have changed any behaviour) and can therefore 
be removed.
Spotted by the Coverity checker.
