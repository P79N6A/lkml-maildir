Actually, the issue I was looking at was more focused on security
patches which implement multiple security countermeasures which do
precisely dick; except that they cover eachothers' flaws so that
together they create a real solution.
It's kind of like locking your front door, or your back door.  If one is
locked and the other other is still wide open, then you might as well
not even have doors.  If you lock both, then you (finally) create a
problem for an intruder.
That is to say, patch A will apply and work without B; patch B will
apply and work without patch A; but there's no real gain from using
either without the other.
