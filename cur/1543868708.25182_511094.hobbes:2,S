The term "segregated group of processes" is too vague.  Segregated for
what?  What is the kernel supposed to do with this information?

This argument goes away if you just rename these resource groups to
resource namespaces.

Did you like the names I came up with in my original reply?
 - CPUset namespace for CPU partitioning
 - Resource namespaces:
   - cpusched namespace for CPU
   - ulimit namespace for memory
   - quota namespace for disk space
   - io namespace for disk activity
   - etc

Maybe what's missing is a set of helper macros/functions that assist
with writing new namespaces.  Perhaps you can give some more examples
and we can consider these on a case by case basis.
