First of all you should really talk to your lawyer about if and how you
can do this legally.

A *lot* of things changed.

Yes; basically versioning checks are a very rough approximation of a
check on ABI. Linux does not keep abi for modules at all, every single
release and a whopping lot of config options each result in an entirely
different ABI. Heck even most bugfixes will change the abi.

yes; however you're much better off shipping the sourcecode of your
module, or if your lawyer allows that (there may be some patent issues
involved), you can choose to ship a .o file and a glue layer, where the
glue layer abstracts the kernel ABI/API away entirely.
