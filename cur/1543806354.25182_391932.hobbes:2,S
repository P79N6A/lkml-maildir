On the other hand, I mostly use DVDs now, and growisofs is just
wonderful, and much easier to work with from the command line.  Maybe
someday we won't care about burning CDs anymore, or maybe growisofs will
add support for it.
Or maybe someone else will maintain a patch that fixes the dumb
"warnings" and such in cdrecord that people can apply to it.  As long as
it doesn't do anything as messy as the pioneer dvd burning patch did.
