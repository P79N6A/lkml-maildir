Subject: [PATCH] Video updates for pre7
	Hi Linus
Here are some updates for the frame buffer code in 2.2.0pre7:
  - atyfb.diff: fixes for the ATI Mach64 frame buffer device.
      o Program the memory clock to 83 MHz on RAGE IIC and VT4, and 100
        MHz on RAGE PRO. This should be the same value as the BIOS uses.
        Since XF86_Mach64 queries the BIOS for the memory clock value the
        screen distortion when running XF86_Mach64 on top of atyfb should
        be gone.
      o Don't powerdown the DLL on RAGE IIC. Now it works on the
        Apple iMac.
      o Enable text console hardware acceleration in 24 bpp. This was
        still disabled by accident.
      o The clear_margins() routines play with the frame buffer contents,
        so they must wait for the finishing of the acceleration engine
        first to prevent screen corruption.
      o Optimization: Add a blitter_may_be_busy flag, which is cheaper to
        check than the real hardware flag.
  - m68k.diff: Sync with Linux/m68k 2.2.0pre6 from Jes:
      o Replace PTOV() and VTOP() by phys_to_virt() and virt_to_phys()
        like the other archs use.
      o Replace kernel_map() by io_remap() like the other archs.
      o Fix the Penguin logo in some cases of interleaved bitplanes.
      o Make virgefb work on the Zorro II version of the CyberVision 64/3D
        graphics board for Amiga. Before it worked in Zorro III mode only.
      o Remove obsolete #defines for m68k in include/video/font.h
  - pm2.diff: Permedia 2 frame buffer device
      o Add a real driver for the CyberVisionPPC and BVisionPPC graphics
        boards on Amigas with APUS (Amiga Power Up System) PPC expansion.
      o Remove the pseudo driver cvppcfb.c for the CyberVisionPPC and
        BVisionPPC now we have pm2fb.
  - misc.diff: Miscellaneous fixes
      o creatorfb.c: move the wait for the finishing of the acceleration
        engine to increase accel engine and CPU parallelism.
      o creatorfb.c: recognize the Elite 3D
      o fbcon.c: fixes for 512-character fonts
      o sbusfb.c: cursor fixes.
Thanks for applying these patches to your tree!
Greetings,
						Geert
