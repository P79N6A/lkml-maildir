Yes. calling journal_dirty_data() on unmapped buffer can definitely
happen. (only thing i am not sure is - why doesn't happen with a
simple testcase like dirtying only a part of a page in 1k filesystem.
I am not sure why we need journal_unmap_buffer() in the sequence).
Here is what I think is happening..
journal_unmap_buffer() - cleaned the buffer, since its outside EOF, but
its a part of the same page. So it remained on the page->buffers
list. (at this time its not part of any transaction).
Then, ordererd_commit_write() called journal_dirty_data() and we added
all these buffers to BJ_SyncData list. (at this time buffer is clean -
not dirty).
Now msync() called __set_page_dirty_buffers() and dirtied *all* the
buffers attached to this page.
journal_submit_data_buffers() got around to this buffer and tried to
submit the buffer...
Andrew is right - only option for us to check the filesize in the
write out path and skip the buffers beyond EOF.
Thanks,
Badari
