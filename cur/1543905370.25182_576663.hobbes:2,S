Nope. I can't equate your soliloquy about the development process with
what it appears you are doing in the case of plugsched but you're
obviously too smart for me to argue against or I don't understand and
I've already overstepped my authority on this mailing list being an
ordinary user.  I'll just end up trying to extract your boot from my
anus.
