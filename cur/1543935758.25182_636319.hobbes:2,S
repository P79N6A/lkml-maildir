I have to admit, the RJ11 variant was from a long time ago, when Ethernet
was still either Thickwire or Thinwire, and this Cat-N stuff was still in
the future, so RJ45 wasn't exactly a common critter.  For reference, the
machine involved was an ATT 3B2-400, and some Blit terminals were in the mix,
which tells you just how far back that was.. ;)
