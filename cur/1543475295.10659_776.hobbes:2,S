	As long as there is no WIDELY DEPLOYED 'tar' program with
	support for BZ2, I don't think it to be an easy replacement
	for GZ.  Everything else is mostly smoke-screen...
	Until then, GZ is the easy to use form, and BZ2 is a neat
	alternate which may or may not succeed to replace gzip's
	current primary algorithm.
	If g(un)zip developers become activated again, we could
	yet see a new version of (at least) gunzip which can handle
	BZ2, and thus all complaining is over.  After all, gunzip
	can already open BSD compress, and (SysV?) pack files!
	Once that happens, and has been deployed for at least 6 months,
	we can scrap the GZ format in favour of BZ2.

	Depending which you use divider.
	In reality the difference is smaller as the comparison
	*should* be done against the raw uncompressed material.

	The beast clearly needs lots of tuning, as bunzip2 is slower
	than gunzip by factor 3.8  (but your CPU is free, isn't it ?)

	Compression with bzip2 is slower by about factor 1.5 ...

	I do have many hats, when I speak about  ftp.funet.fi, it appears
	to be an Academic hat.  I can also speak with commercial ISP hat..
	(and of course in neither case am I spokesperson for them!)
	Commercial dialup users are now getting flat-rate service at
	about 8.50 Euros per month, so I won't care about their con-
	nection times at all.  (I do access services at my work, so I
	should know..  If they are not downloading, they are browsing
	the web and idling, or - heaven forbid - just idling...)
	In every case people should *not* be downloading every full
	dump, rather only those patch-files from the last full level
	they have, up to the lattest they are interested in.
	(Only every 10 levels download the full file, if that often.)

	With these the 7-12% size difference really does not matter.
	A 10 kilobyte difference means mere 2-10 seconds in download
	time.  If people are foolish enough to download 10+ megabytes
	at every snapshot over a slow modem, nothing can help it.

	ftp.funet.fi has FDDI, which is connected to FUNET core
	routers.  From those routers:
	STM-1/POS to NORDUnet@Stockholm, and from there to USA.
	STM-1/ATM to academic campus lans.
	STM-1/ATM over FICIX (FICIX is STM-1/ATM switch) to other
	nationally interconnected service providers, then various
	speeds from 64k up to STM-16/POS to their customers (and
	customers^2, etc..)   To ISP like sites the national cross-
	connectivity capacity usually exceeds 2Mbps.  International
	capacity costs way more, like 10 times more, than the equi-
	valent national transit capacity...
	(Indeed I am aware of the price differences in data services
	 in between Finland, and middle europe..)
