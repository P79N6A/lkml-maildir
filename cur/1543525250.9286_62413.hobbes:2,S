Subject: 2.3.43: Warning: kfree_skb on hard IRQ

Got a few of these when the eth-card was initialised during boot:
Warning: kfree_skb on hard IRQ c01b6408
From System.map:
c01b6538 t TLan_HandleStatOverflow
c01b6550 t TLan_HandleRxEOF
I've never seen these before, but I have seen:
 TLAN:  Couldn't allocate memory for received data. 
last message repeated 89 times
last message repeated 200 times
from time to time in previous 2.3.* kernels (up to 2.3.42)
I don't know if that is related.
Tlan compiled in staticly, egcs-2.91.66, more info on request if needed.
