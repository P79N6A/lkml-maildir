No, we have not. It is fine for modprobe doing that, as it is for any
other binary too. It's also the usual glibc behavior for syslog(). Any
userspace binary can access /dev/console any time. The kernel is not
supposed to call modprobe to make /dev/console availabe.

We are not reordering, we provide a registered /dev/console driver
core device, not touching any driver, just to prevent the kernel
module loader from going crazy.

We can do the real fix any time it is the proper time. It is still an
obvious kernel bug which needs to be fixed, and not some obscure
userspace rule, we suddenly need to establish to work around some dumb
module loader/console logic.
