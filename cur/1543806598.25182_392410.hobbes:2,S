What would you do to handle the following case:
pid = getpid();
if (sys_clone(CLONE_CONTAINER) == 0) {
	ppid = getppid();
	assert(ppid == pid);
}
Most of the calls involving resource ids will return values that aren't
*consistent* with ids already stored in userland... could possibly break some
piece of code. Perhaps a sys_exec() should also be enforced to reset the process
memory.
