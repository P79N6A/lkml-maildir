No, that's not what it's for.  It means 'for Christ sake don't use
interrupts, I know what I'm doing'.

irq=none is passed in order to diagnose whether a problem happens on
only the interrupt-driven path or not.  Read the trouble-shooting
section parport.txt.  Understand that there are lots of printing code
paths nowadays (polling, interrupt-driven, PIO, DMA, etc).

Jeff, it needs to.  If you want to make irq=auto the default
(currently it's 'probe only'), then that is an entirely different
thing.
When the user tells you not to use interrupts, you'd better not.

What the hell for?  Just don't use the interrupts.
Tim.
