This is gibberish.  You have no idea what you're talking about.

"lock-free SMP"?  This is very nearly a self-contradiction.  If you'd bother
looking at the allocators, guess what you'll see?  You'll see locking.

Bullshit, there are no such atomicity problems.

A maintainer will invent valgrind primitives to express concepts that valgrind
doesn't know about?

There are no simultaneous allocator and valgrind state transitions.
You really need to acquire a clue from somewhere.
