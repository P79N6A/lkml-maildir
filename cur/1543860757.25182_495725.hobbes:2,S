Nobody promised you that NFSv4 would be consistent. The above is a crock
of shit that carries over from RFC1813. fileid isn't even a mandatory
attribute in NFSv4.

No! Read what I said in that last email again. The above crap is
precisely the algorithm I said is NOT wanted in the Linux client. We're
NOT going to do a bunch of totally unnecessary extra GETATTR calls in
order to cater to 1 or 2 servers out there that actually think the above
is a good idea. Not even Solaris does that IIRC.
