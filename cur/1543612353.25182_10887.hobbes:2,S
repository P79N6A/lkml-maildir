When your /var is located somewhere on /dev/hdaX probably not. My syslog makes
disc access every few seconds (strangely even without writing something..)
Disabling syslog might help, but that isn't an issue. So my drive wake up
immediately after went to sleep. But for other drives there 
should be no problem.
