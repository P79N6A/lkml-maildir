Subject: [PATCH] abit nf7-s timer workaround new entry
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/9/23/359

Without this patch, dmi_scan.c does not apply a workaround for my
motherboard + bios version, and my timer is XT-PIC instead of
IO-APIC-edge. My bios is more recent than the other entry in the table
for my motherboard.
Patch against 2.6.9-rc2-bk8. The patch will need to be massaged as I was
unsure whether the motherboard id fields were supposed to be unique.
