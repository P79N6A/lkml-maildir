As some of you may be aware, I've been creating a series of articles on
porting device drivers (and other kernel code) to the 2.5 kernel.  That
series is now (more or less) complete.  It's also freely available at this
point - no subscription gates to worry about.  So I wanted to be sure
people knew that this resource is there:
	
http://lwn.net/Articles/driver-porting/
If there is interest, I could repackage this stuff under some sort of
suitably free license for wider distribution.  It's easier for me to keep
it up to date on the LWN site, though.  I'd also be curious to hear if
there's any additional topics that people think I should have covered.
