The code itself is OK I guess; the physid_t changes
may well be important, although they could be redone.
It's the comment that bugs me, specifically:
"Make everything compile and boot again."
"The earlier third party ioport.c changes unfortunately
didn't even compile, fix that too."
"Finish ioport.c merge and fix compilation"
(BTW, there's a bit more beyond the end of what I quoted)
I'm OK with whatever ensures that somebody looking back
through the BitKeeper logs isn't going to come to the
conclusion that I broke something.
Um, not everybody will grab updates from bkbits.net,
right? Pardon me for being clueless about BitKeeper,
but is there some command Andi or Linus could run?
