The concept of passing in a little structure telling how to
acknowledge an interrupt is a very good one. I'd like to see it added
as a kernel feature so that drivers could start being converted to it.
This is a big deal for Xen since Xen has the same problem with
forwarded IRQs. Xen would pass the little structure from the domain to
the supervisor so that the supervisor could cut off the IRQ if the
domain fails.
