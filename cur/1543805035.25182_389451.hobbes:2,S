There's nothing crybaby about it! Copyleft is, as Stallman puts it, to flip 
copyright on its head. If there was no such thing as copyright or other forms 
of laws / restrictions on sharing ideas and intangible implementations, there 
would be zero reason for the GPL because all the GPL aims to do is to 
preserve the freedom to share.
So in that sense the GPL is about *enforcing* freedom.
I must admit that I'm terribly confused - I thought all of this was well 
understood and accepted. Why must everyone attempt to spin the GPL into 
something it is not? The only way the terms of this license would be in any 
way restrictive on anyone is if they decided to *exploit* a given GPL work in 
order to *restrict* the rights of future users of the work. In that case, the 
GPL would intervene and say 'No'.

The GPL isn't about anyone's "work" or "credit". The licenses that ARE 
concerned with "credit" are licenses like the original BSD license with its 
attribution clause - you must stamp your product and documentation with 
notices that say your stuff was done by the University of Berkeley.

Are you suggesting that Stallman claims he developed GNU/Linux? Perhaps I'm 
just really misunderstanding what you just said, but if you really did mean 
it that way, perhaps you ought to point out where. If you're referring to the 
fact that Stallman doesn't like people calling the combination of the kernel 
and GNU tools "Linux", then it's only crybaby if you refuse to believe his 
published intentions (that "we" care more about open source than free 
software, and he's only trying to make sure that "free software" isn't 
forgotten). That last part I don't agree with (I think plenty of kernel 
people care greatly about free software), but I don't think it's silly to 
call the full OS GNU/Linux either. 
In any case, I don't think Stallman is concerned about fame so much as he is 
concerned with his movement. If it were most other people, I'd say it's all 
about fame, but Stallman has at least in my eyes proven himself to 
consistently concern himself only with his philosophy.
I don't really blame Stallman for anything he's said that you might take as an 
attempt to take credit. I get the impression from seeing the interplay 
between "open source" and "free software", ESR and RMS, that ESR would be 
happy to write free software and Richard Stallman right out of history. And 
since I value "free software" just as much as I value "open source", I don't 
want to see that happen.
The bottom line of all my rambling here is that these licenses aren't about 
maintaining credit at all, which I think you were implying in your message. 
Sans these "You will play by my rules or..." clauses, there would be no huge 
open source community because the proprietary software vendors would vacuum 
up anything of value and use it as leverage to lock people in. (And as for 
your comment about BBSes and the days without licenses, a zillion dollar 
proprietary software business had not yet been invented).
If you want open source licenses with no restrictions at all, that's "public 
domain". And "public domain" won't ever be what it could be until you abolish 
copyright.
Cheers,
Chase
