I'm still at it. I does make sense to convert the damn macros to inline
functions. The question now is the order of things, the macro cleanup
first or the sub-page page tables first? I would prefer the sub-page
page tables first since that code has been hanging around in -mm for a
while and could go upstream after I regenerated the patch and test
compiled it again. We do need it for KVM and we want to push our KVM
patches for s390 soon.
