I believe this particular race has been recognized since day one of
get_user_pages, and we've always demanded that the caller must do a
SetPageDirty (I should probably say set_page_dirty) before freeing
the pages held for writing.
Which is why I was a bit puzzled to see that prior set_page_dirty
in __follow_page, which Andrew identified as for s390.

I've not yet reached a conclusion on that,
need to think more about doing mkclean in copy_one_pte.
