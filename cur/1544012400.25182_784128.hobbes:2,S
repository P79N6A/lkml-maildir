applied all four patches to tip/irq/sparseirq:
 18eefed: irq: simplify for_each_irq_desc() usage
 26ddd8d: proc: remove ifdef CONFIG_SPARSE_IRQ from stat.c
 f9af0e7: irq: for_each_irq_desc() move to irqnr.h
 51bc39f: hrtimer: remove #include <linux/irq.h>
the whole series is very nice and removes quite a bit of irq_desc usage 
complexity. Thanks guys,
	Ingo
