	Hi Marcelo,
	Here is the batch of IrDA patches for 2.4.22. I would
appreciate if you could add them to 2.4.22-preX.
	Most of those patches have been on my web page and in 2.5.X
since 2.4.20 time (an eternity), the last few are more recent but
trivial, so it should be as smooth as usual.
	The first patch make PPP over IrCOMM works properly when using
chat, so pretty important in some corners. The second helps with
interoperability, for example for people with (buggy) Ericsson
phones. Then, a bunch of other minor fixes.
	As far as development of IrDA in 2.4.X, this is the end of the
road. I still plan to provide for 2.4.X essential bug fixes and maybe
driver improvements when needed. 2.5.X is where IrDA development is
happening and is too different from 2.4.X for easy backporting (I
don't want to backport the big structural changes of 2.5.X).
	Have fun...
	Jean
