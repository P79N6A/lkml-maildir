I assume you meant 256 bits not bytes, 256 bytes is larger than many
cache lines.
If the data is in task struct *and* you only update it in response to
requests from the current task then you do not need any locks, the fact
that you are running under the current task is enough.  But if you want
to update audit flags in one task from another task's context or from
interrupt then you need a lock.

Use the test_bit macros, they already exist and are portable.
