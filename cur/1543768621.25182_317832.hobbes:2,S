I am yet to convince myself that this is possible. Maybe possible and if
its possible we should close those holes.

No it wont. a process can contaminate namespaces if the process has
access to both the namespace simultaneously.  With the proposed syscall,
the process would have access to one namespace at any given point in
time. There cannot be a instance where a process will have access
to vfsmounts belonging to two different namespaces. 
So I dont' think contamination is possible. By contamination I mean
'ability for a process to bind mount from one namespace to other'
