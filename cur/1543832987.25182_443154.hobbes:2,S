Actually, the way Andrew wrote it, it _is_ needed. It does two things:
 - it's the block scope that allows the private variables
 - if the "get_user()" fails, the "break" means that you don't have to 
   have a goto.
That said, I think it's wrong to use "__get_user()", which can hang on the 
MM semaphore if something is bogus. We should probably mark us as being 
"in_atomic()" to make sure that the page fault handler, if it is entered, 
will not try to get the semaphore or page anything in.
But that's a separate issue.
