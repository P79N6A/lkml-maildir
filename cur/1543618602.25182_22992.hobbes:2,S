I think you read it right.  I believe it comes from Linus
integrating Andrea's VM, but making changes to it on the fly.
So one end has a capability that the other end now prohibits.
In Andrea's -aa tree it isn't quite the same; and I don't think
it's worth tidying up the mainline here, while there's the
possibility that more of Andrea's version is to be merged in.
