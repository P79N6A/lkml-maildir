I think you have to promote when you fall asleep. I think the only thing
you have to take care in the common case is to keep track of which task
owns a semaphore - then you can build the inheritance graph then. This is
somewhat costly, but could be worth the price. Priority inheritance should
go through a mechanism that makes the inheriting process forget the new
priority after the next rescheduling, and the schedule() call of priority
inheritance should make sure that the next one happens at least when
crossing the kernel border.
