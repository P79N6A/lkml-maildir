I had the same problem with exmh.
On redhat-6.1 the rpm knfsd-clients contains rpc.statd and rpc.lockd.
This are controlled with the script /etc/rc.d/init/nfslock and provide
the locking facilities.
I'm not sure about other distributions but the knfsd-clients (or similar)
rpm,
deb, tarball for them should also contain these.
