Hi John,
thanks a lot for the patch! However I think I have already added all the 
needed support for this keyboard. It is currently in my tree, queued until 
Linus opens the merge window for 2.6.24. Please look at 
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/jikos/hid.git;a=commitdiff;h=0f48b3ce23a34dbe70dcd04b4216fbcb965ab906
Commit 945bcc3a in the same branch is also related.
