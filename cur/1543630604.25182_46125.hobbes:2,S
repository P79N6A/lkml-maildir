Hmm.  The aic7xxx chip could have botched a master transaction somehow,
but that's still hard to say.  Can you have the driver dump out its
chip state (call ahc_dump_card_state(ahc) from within the pci interrupt
handler) to get some additional information?

How much memory is in the box?  What version of the aic7xxx driver
were you using under 2.4.18?
