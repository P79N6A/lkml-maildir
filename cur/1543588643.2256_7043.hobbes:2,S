To be honest I get very little patch material I didnt want to track. I get
lots of patches that are wrong, misguided, or otherwise flawed. However
I want to see those patches so I can help get them fixed.
On the whole people seem to be fairly good at sending stuff to obvious 
maintainers. Sometimes I bounce a few on. Big global changes to vm/vfs I tend
to ignore because those kind of things tend to be stuff Linus cares a lot 
about getting right anyway.
