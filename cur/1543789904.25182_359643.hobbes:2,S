Look how you're using "all", generalizing left and right.  You just want to
create this FUD and spread this FUD that I don't work well with anyone.  Yep,
this is a pretty low blow.  While in fact did you talk to everyone I work with?
I say, when people are losing it on the technical front, they try to attack
personally and on political basis.
Have a nice day,
