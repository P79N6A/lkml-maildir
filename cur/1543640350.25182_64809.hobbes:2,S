Actually, my attack model here assumes a hostile LAN. GHz WAN is
fairly uncommon.
This design comes from an entropy pool I made from scratch for another
system and fixed what I thought the deficits are in the Linux
model. Current Linux a) overestimates entropy b) can't incorporate
untrusted data c) doesn't sample from the network at all.
I think if I'd broken this up this way:
piece 1a: mix in untrusted data without accounting it
piece 1b: start sampling the network as untrusted data
piece 2a: clean up bogosity in entropy accounting
..no one would have objected.

Oddly enough, I came home today from running errands to discover that
someone had tried brute-forcing my front door with a crowbar.
