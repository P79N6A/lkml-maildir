never ever consider dbench a serious benchmark; the thing is you can
make dbench a lot better very easy; just make the kernel run one thread
at a time until completion. dbench really gives very variable results,
but it is not really possible to say if +100% or -100% is an improvement
or a degredation for real life. So please just don't run it, or at least
don't interpret the results in a "higher is better" way.
