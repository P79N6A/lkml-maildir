Subject: Linux does not initialize graphics cards on x86 (was atyfb with 2.3.30  on x86)

Hello,
As I have one AGP Card (ATI Rage Furry, for aty128fb) and one PCI Card (ATI Xpert@Play, for
atyfb) I have made some tries :-(
If I put in the BIOS AGP first, then I got (with answer from Geert Uytterhoeven):
> atyfb : 3D RAGE PRO (PQFP, PCI) [0x4750 rev 0x7e] 512K RESV, 14.31818 MHz PLL, 100 MHz MCLK
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^

Hmm, this means the card wasn't initialized at all. Looks like we'll have to
write our own memory probing code for platforms where only one video card is
initialized. On PPC, all ATI cards get initialized by Open Firmware.
So reading that answer (many thanks for it Geert :-)) I reboot and put PCI first, and of course
the boot display on my other monitor, the screen came to my defined mode for atyfb, and in place
of the NO VIDEO MEMORY, I got:
Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 160x64
fb0: ATY Mach 64 frame buffer device on PCI
But I am in a graphical fb on that card: great first time :-) But as I have compiled  also aty128fb
in it, the screen hangs at that last lign and the boot process terminate :-(
So I could have one fb, depending of my BIOS setting of AGP/PCI first... very bad, isn't it?
I think that's a linux problem on x86 (I have an ASUS P2B-LS with recent BIOS) (or is there a
secret way of initializing both cards?).
Thanks for your help,
	Greg						ICQ:16624071
