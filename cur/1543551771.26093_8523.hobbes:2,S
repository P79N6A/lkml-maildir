if you do:
	request_irq(&my_irq_handler,... 0, ...)
then my_irq_handler will be recalled with irq enabled.
If you do:
	request_irq(&my_irq_handler,... SA_INTERRUPT, ...)
then my_irq_handler will be recalled with irq disabled.
SA_INTERRUPT only controls if an irq handler is recalled with irq
enabled or disabled (locally of course).
keyboard_interrupt is registered w/o SA_INTERRUPT so it will be
recalled with irq enabled and so you someway need to do a __cli() before
spinning on the lock.

Timer, bottomhalves (softirq) and tasklets (and softnet) are always
recalled with irq enabled. So if it would be called by timer/tasklet/bhhandler
it should use irq version of the spinlocks too if it needs to run with irq
locally disabled.
One thing you could safely change in keyboard_interrupt is to remove the save
part of the spinlock by using spin_lock_irq (we don't need to save anything
since keyboard_interrupt is only recalled as an irq handler).
