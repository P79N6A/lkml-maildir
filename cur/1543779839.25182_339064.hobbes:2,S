The local_irq_enable() call in init/main.c:start_kernel()
If you want to run gdb earlier you need to do it without a tasklet.

How about you use KDB_VECTOR and rename it to DEBUG_VECTOR
and then just check if kgdb is currently active? 
KDB can do the same.
I changed the assignment in my tree like this:
#define SPURIOUS_APIC_VECTOR    0xff
#define ERROR_APIC_VECTOR       0xfe
#define RESCHEDULE_VECTOR       0xfd
#define CALL_FUNCTION_VECTOR    0xfc
#define KDB_VECTOR              0xfb    /* reserved for KDB */
#define THERMAL_APIC_VECTOR     0xfa
/* 0xf9 free */
#define INVALIDATE_TLB_VECTOR_END       0xf8
#define INVALIDATE_TLB_VECTOR_START     0xf0    /* f0-f8 used for TLB flush */
but that can be merged later. THere will be probably more changes
with the per CPU IDT planned.

The code is equivalent to passing shortcut|APIC_DM_NMI and vector == 0

Ok.
