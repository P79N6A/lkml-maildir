Sorry. I was typing that from memory. I'll fix it. Btw, could you make
the kbd package accept scancodes in the 0x80-0xff range (same as e000 to
e07f), if it is not yet there? And how about scancodes in the
0x100-0x1ff range? Will those work?
One more question: Will kbdrate work properly (use ioctls) when compiled
on a 2.6 kernels?
