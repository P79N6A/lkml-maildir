Well Jan's example was of Coda that uses 128-bit internal file ids.

Hmm, sometimes you can't fix the world, especially if the filesystem
is exported over NFS and has a problem with fitting its file IDs uniquely
into a 64-bit identifier.

If the syscall is working on two pathnames I agree there might be a race
that isn't different from calling lstat() on each of these names
before opening them. But I'm not sure I see a race if you operate on two
open file descriptors (compared to fstat()ing both of them)
On the nfs side, if the client looked up two names (or opened them over nfsv4)
and has two filehandles in hand, asking the server whether they refer to the
same object isn't racy.
