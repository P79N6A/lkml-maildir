As you know, there is not substitute for backups. What if the disk had
totally crashed and scratched GBs of your data.
And did you ever trust those (non-compressed) executables that you saved
after recovering them from corruption?
Of course not. No one would. The fact that they were not compressed did
not save them.
You are really arguing for backups, not for one filesystem or another.
Besides, Jan claimed that corruption due to bad blocks propagates to
MULTIPLE files because of the compression in the file system. You are
arguing something different.

You don't really mean that. Most backup uses compression (which
propagates errors through the rest of the file).

I retired quite young.
