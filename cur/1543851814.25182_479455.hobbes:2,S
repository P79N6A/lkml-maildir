Hi;
2.6.18, 2.6.18.1 and 2.6.18.2 still panics randomly (it seems this is not 
related to smpreplacament bug solved in .2) in VmWare and Microsoft Virtual 
PC and in order to confirm this bug is not our distro specific i downloaded 
and tried latest OpenSuse also [1]  and [2] are screens captured by vmware 
but exact same panic occurs in Virtual PC as reported to us in [3]. I CC'ed 
previous threads receivers also.
