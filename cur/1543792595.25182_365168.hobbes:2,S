FYI, i have released your big MIPS merge as part of 2.6.14-rt9. [please 
double-check i did not mis-merge any component]
wrt. your TLB problems: it might be related that TLB handling got 
simplified (and sped up) with the introduction of a generic, preemptible 
method to handle TLB-gathers. There's no tlb-simple.h anymore.
excessive context-switching might happen in some cases when we ping-pong 
short-held locks, and i'm certainly interested in a reproducer or 
analysis (or patch! :-).
