Sorry, that was a fingerslip.  I meant to say Keith.
BTW I'm looking at your kbuild 2.5 performance measurements at
http://www.mail-archive.com/kbuild-devel
%40lists.sourceforge.net/msg01434.html
Looks like 9 seconds to rebuild the kernel after a small change
on a quad 700MHz pentium, right?   (Or does 'make phase4' not actually build?)
What would the time be on a dual pentium?
