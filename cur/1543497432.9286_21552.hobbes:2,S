   Has anyone done this?  If this is an area where we need some work, I'll 
   add the appropriate test to lmbench.
ummm...
? ls -l | wc -l

Not entirely scientific, but the point is that I don't think we have a
performance problem here...  I still think such a test in lmbench is
very useful.
Maybe he was talking about 2.0.x, we really sucked in this case there,
without the new dcache...
