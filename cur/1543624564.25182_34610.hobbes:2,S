Hi,
anyone here with HP Omnibook 6000 successfully rebooting? I do have this
beast and after issuing /sbin/reboot, the machine is halted with the LCD
almost blank (you can see what was there a moment before, but it is almost
black), CD LED blinking and waiting for me to hold the poweroff button for
about 5 seconds? No command parameters (like reboot=bios or warm or cold or
whatever) helped. It happened in the past and it still happens with
2.4.18-4GB.
The same problem is mentioned here:

Machine can poweroff, but not reboot. APM works. I do not know if it is
connected with PCMCIA as that page says...
Do you know?
