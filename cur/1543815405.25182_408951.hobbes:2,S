IIRC, I've seen this error already in a post for 2.6.16-rc6-rt1
> *** Warning: "mutex_destroy" [fs/xfs/xfs.ko] undefined!
mutex_destroy isn't defined for CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT.
In the past mutex_destroy was defined in fs/xfs/linux_26/mutex.h, but
this has been moved. Have a look at: include/linux/mutex-debug.h,
kernel/mutex-debug.c, include/linux/mutex.h
