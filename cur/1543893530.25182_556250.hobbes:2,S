The refcounting for mpol's doesn't look good in general. I'm more
curious as to what releases the refcounts. alloc_page_vma(), for
instance, does get_vma_policy() which eventually takes a reference,
without ever releasing the reference it acquires. get_vma_policy()
itself uses a similar idiom to that used in aglitke's patch. I think
mpol refcounting needs to be addressed elsewhere besides this patch.
