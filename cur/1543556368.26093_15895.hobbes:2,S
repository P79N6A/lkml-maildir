My development box (running test10pre5) is SMP, and it works fine.  I
haven't updated to the latest kernel version because I like my
filesystems in one piece, and the netfilter code hasn't changed.
What is your kernel configuration, and iptables version?  Have you
patched the kernel?
Thanks for the report,
Rusty.
