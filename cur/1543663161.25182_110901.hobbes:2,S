Hiya.
I am experiencing problems getting certain 2.5.60 and
2.5.61 and also 2.5.62 to boot. One 2.5.60 is working,
the others are just doing something as I only see the
Uncompressing... and then nothing is happening at all
except my hard disc doing something which is not booting,
I feel. I fail to remember what the difference was between
the two versions of 2.5.60 (one running, the other is not).
Any ideas/hints on what this is?
Thanks,
Alexander
