Just about all bioses that support suspend do not have the knowledge
that an
operating system would use apics, since windows95 doesn't do that. The
fact
that it appears to mostly work for you is RARE. You're very very lucky
with
an almost not broken bios..... UP APIC and Suspend are usually very
exclusive.
(well, actually, the suspend often works, it's the resume that hurts)
