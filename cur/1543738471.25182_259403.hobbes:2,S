 FYI, the DECstation and TURBOchannel Alpha systems also have a DMA
facility for their 85C30s, both for async and for sync modes.  It is set
up in a much less fancy way, though.  For transmission you set up a
pointer to a buffer within a 4kB page containing data to be sent.  The
transmission concludes with the end of the page and you get a
transmit-done interrupt.  For reception you set up a pointer within the
first half of a 4kB page.  You get an interrupt when the pointer crosses
the half-page boundary, meaning you need to switch buffers.  Once the
pointer reaches the end of the page, reception is disabled and you get an
overrun interrupt.  The only oddity is bytes in transmit and receive
buffers need to be word-aligned -- the transactions on the system bus are
performed as 32-bit ones.
