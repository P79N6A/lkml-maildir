I smell a big conspiracy! So yet again it's mixed mixed
fs$ grep __init */*.c | grep -v ' init_'
sysfs/mount.c:int __init sysfs_init(void)
sysv/inode.c:int __init sysv_init_icache(void)
proc/vmcore.c:static int __init vmcore_init(void)
proc/nommu.c:static int __init proc_nommu_init(void)

No I despise casts more than missing consts. Why would gcc throw a warning?
Let's take this super simple program
<<<
struct inode;
struct dentry;
struct mknod_args {
    struct inode *parent;
    struct dentry *dentry;
    int mode;
    int dev;
};
extern int vfs_mknod(struct inode *, struct dentry *, int, int /*dev_t*/);
int main(void) {
    const struct mknod_args *m;
    vfs_mknod(m->parent, m->dentry, m->mode, m->dev);
    return 0;
}
>>>
As undefined-behavior as it looks, it's got the const and vfs_mknod, as well as
an approximation of dev_t. It throws no warnings when compiled with `gcc -Wall
-c test.c`. Did I miss something?
