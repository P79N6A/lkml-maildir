Subject: Preserving uptime with kexec?

Like many people, I like to brag about how great my uptime is.  But like
many other people, I like to keep my kernel up-to-date with the latest
and greatest from kernel.org.  I recently discovered the magic of kexec,
which allows me to switch kernels without rebooting for real.
Unfortunately, kexec resets my uptime when it runs.
Would anyone be interested in fixing this, and/or would anyone be
interested in *me* writing a patch for it?  I don't know if it violates
some contract where uptime is counted from the kernel boot, but it seems
like, for consistency's sake, it should count from the last hardware
boot.
