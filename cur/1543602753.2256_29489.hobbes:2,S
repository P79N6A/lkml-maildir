Yes, somehow that got missed.
There is a patch that fixes this and other issues at
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ports/ppc/ppc-patch-2.4.10.bz2
This patch has the differences between Linus' 2.4.10 and the
linuxppc_2_4 repository.  See 
http://penguinppc.org/dev/kernel.shtml
for details on how to access this and the other PPC repositories.

Sounds like an X config problem.  I suggest you ask on the
linuxppc-user@lists.linuxppc.org mailing list, you might get more help
there.
