No... this is the full text from that page. If there is an update please
tell me where it was published.
     [EOVERFLOW]
         The file is a regular file, nbyte is greater than 0, the
         starting position is before the end-of-file and the starting
         position is greater than or equal to the offset maximum
         established in the open file description associated with
fildes.

But they do talk about "starting position is before the end-of-file"
which
may be different from "the offset maximum established in the open file
description associated with fildes". 
Thinking more about it, there must be (at least one ) typo there.
One possible interpretation is that "the endind pisition is greater than
.."
and the "maximum established" refers to file system or device
limitations.
(eg. if offset+nbyte > 2^31 on 2 file system that is limited to 2 GB).
Another possibility - they really mean non-regular files. There is no
explicit EOF (eg, on /dev/fd0) but you try to access beyond the physical
size of the device.
