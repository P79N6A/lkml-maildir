According to the code comments in drivers/acpi/acpica/tbfadt.c:
  * The PM event blocks are split into two register blocks, first is the
  * PM Status Register block, followed immediately by the PM Enable
  * Register block. Each is of length (xpm1x_event_block.bit_width/2).
  *
  * On various systems the v2 fields (and particularly the bit widths)
  * cannot be relied upon, though. Hence resort to using the v1 length
  * here (and warn about the inconsistency).
So it looks like it's fixing things up, so it's not really a problem, 
just warning about busted BIOS tables. Not impossible it's related to 
the resume problem, but wouldn't be the first thing I'd look at..
