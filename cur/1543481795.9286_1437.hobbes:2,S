i've had many of the same problems with 2.0.36. after a few days (anywhere
from one to six), after having 400 users and 800-900 processes running on
a
dual PII 333 with 512mb of ram, i had the same problem occur, where
processes would start to block, and never recover.
alan first suggested raising the DQUOTs.. which helped for a while. but
it's started to crop up again. the free dquots have been fine, yet it
still will start to deadlock on certian partitions (usually /home) but
most recently, also on /proc. it seems to be filesystem specific, when it
occurs.
from scanning the newsgroups, and other random webpages, it seems there is
no solution to this.
are there any patches out there to fix it?
