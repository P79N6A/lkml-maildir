No, it never managed to power off with ACPI. It works with APM though.

The problem is that it doesn't power off at all, no matter how long the

Imho the problem will most likely go away when poweroff works properly
on my board. I can supply whatever info you need to make it work, too ;)
The board is an Asus A7V.
