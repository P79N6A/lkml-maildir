Plus we'd be dead if we had to do the above.  If that read_trylock() fails
the sync() will forget to sync stuff.
And, contra your description, we'll fail the trylock relatively frequently
- when some other process is writing back this superblock.
But as this codepath is never used for data-integrity writeout things
should be OK.  I'll slip a comment in there and maybe a
BUG_ON(wbc->sync_mode == WB_SYNC_ALL).
You didn't tell us where the window is?  It's a bit weird that some other
process can come in and unmount the fs while there are non-zero-refcount
inodes floating about on the superblock.
