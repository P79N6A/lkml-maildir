On Intel machines, you precede a memory access with the 'lock'
instruction. With CPUs i486, and later, only the accessed page
is locked at that instant. Earlier CPUs locked the whole bus.
The PCI/Bus controller handles the #LOCK signal itself to guarantee
the atomicity of a transaction. You should never have to do this
yourself. If you think you have to, just precede each PCI/Bus
address-space access with the 'lock' instruction. You just make
your own version of the readl/readw/readb/etc macros that are
provided. You may find that this deadlocks, though, and all bets
are off. You may have just locked the PCI/Bus off the bus when
you needed it most!!
If you are finding something 'strange' in your PCI/Bus accesses,
it is probably because you didn't use 'nocache' when you obtained
address-space for your PCI Device, i.e., ioremap_nocache() instead of
ioremap().

    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
