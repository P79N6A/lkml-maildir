I was unable to compile gcc-3.0 from CVS this morning - so no tests there
for now...
First the "small" test case:
-----------------------------
2.4.2:
  gcc-2.96:  -O6 -felide-constructors -fPIC
  real    7m31.748s
  user    3m52.340s
  sys     3m38.180s
  Memory consumption:  ~200MB
2.4.3-pre7:
  gcc-2.96:  -O6 -felide-constructors -fPIC
  real    3m52.347s
  user    3m46.120s
  sys     0m3.370s
That's pretty darn impressive Linus !  3m38 -> 3sec !  Now if the GCC people
could only repeat that trick   ;)
Then the bigger one:
-----------------------------
2.4.2:
  gcc-2.96:  -O6 -felide-constructors -fPIC
  Fails compilation with "Virtual memory exhausted!" after
  real    37m28.305s
  user    23m39.930s
  sys     13m44.900s
  Memory consumption:  ~300MB before failure
Note - there are no ulimits set, and the machine has more than enough memory
2.4.3-pre7:
  gcc-2.96:  -O6 -felide-constructors -fPIC
  real    31m48.898s
  user    31m21.460s
  sys     0m26.980s
  Memory consumption:  ~400MB - successful completion
Cool !  I can work again   ;)

Beautiful !
Also, the speedup gained here is ~70 times, which may be more than the changed
allocation in gcc-3 will buy us (was that 32 times?).  And,  after all,  there
_has_ to be some other case out there which is not as easily fixed as the GCC
one.
