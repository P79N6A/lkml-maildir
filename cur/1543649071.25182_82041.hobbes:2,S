Hmm.  Are you certain the last working version wasn't at .30 that just before
Ingos gdt changes.  And changing the gdt is quite likely to have broken loadlin,
as it uses the segments in the gdt from setup.S
I will see if I can build a test patch for this.  Except for the recent EDD
work and the GDT change there really haven't been changes to setup.S so this
failure report is very strange.
