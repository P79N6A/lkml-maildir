Oh crap, sorry, I did mess that up :(

This isn't going to work if CONFIG_DEBUGFS is not enabled either :(

It needs to check for ERR_PTR(-ENODEV) which is the return value if
debugfs is not enabled, and if so, just ignore things.
If NULL is returned, or anything else, it's a real error.
So, try something like:
	if (!ohci_debug_root) {
		retval = -ENOENT;
		goto error_debug;
	}
	if (IS_ERR(ohci_debug_root) && PTR_ERR(ohci_debug_root) != -ENODEV) {
		retval = PTR_ERR(ohci_debug_root);
		goto error_debug;
	}
and let me know of that works for you.
Although the combination of CONFIG_USB_DEBUG and not CONFIG_DEBUGFS is
strange, we could just enable CONFIG_DEBUGFS is USB_DEBUG is enabled and
then simplify this logic a bunch at the same time.
