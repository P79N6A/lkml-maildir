Subject: [PATCH 2/2] uml: avoid calling request_irq in atomic context
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/5/414

From: Paolo 'Blaisorblade' Giarrusso <blaisorblade@yahoo.it>
To avoid calling request_irq under a spinlock, and to simplify code around, code
a state machine to allow safely dropping and retaking sigio_lock during
initialization. The state variable is protected by a spinlock together with much
other stuff (so there's no reason to use atomic_t). See the long comment for
further details.
