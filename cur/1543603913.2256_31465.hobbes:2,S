Just thinking that it's VERY hard to synchronise timings to nanosecond 
or even millisecond
resolution over distributed or even within the same filesystem, how 
about you synchronise
the timestamps to the particular filesystem and not the universe. I.E. 
Instead of incrementing
a "generation count" in each inode you could increment a global 
filesystem count everytime
a file is modified in the filesystem, and then this count is stored in 
the particular inode being
modified. This would allow you to have exact order relationships between 
files in the same
filesystem, and would work perfectly every time for both "types" of apps 
mentioned above.
Outside the filesystem you can then resort to just the (second 
resolution) timestamp.
