I thought my SCSI problems were only showing up with my cd-rw drive because 
that's all I currently have online.
You're stating that the problems reported have been with cd-rw drives, but not 
with hard drives, scanners, etc, using the same SCSI equipment on the same 
systems?
I had assumed that my failure to be able to use my cd-rw drive would prevent 
me from [writing] to any type of SCSI drive reliably.  I even thought I had an 
HP SCSI DDS drive that failed along similar reasons..
Can I do anything to help provide more information to diagnose and resolve 
this?
Replacement of my HP SCSI cdrw drive with a nice new ATAPI 40x writer is not a 
problem, but the fear that there is an open issue in my system in something as 
significant as SCSI is bothersome..
Thanks!
