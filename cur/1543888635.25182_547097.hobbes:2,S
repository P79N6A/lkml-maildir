For example mplayer uses SIGSEGV: it does not check ALL of the possible
error situations, in case of SIGSEGV (a bad stream etc) it quickly
reinit itself from the last position. It's much better in performance (well
sure for a stream without error, or only few of them) than to check all of
the possible problems. Nowdays it may not a problem to check everything but
it WAS when MPlayer born (much slower CPUs). But some signals are also
useful for emulation etc (eg in my own DOS emulator some years ago ....).
