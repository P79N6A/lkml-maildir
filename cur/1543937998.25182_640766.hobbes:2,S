Dear Jan,
I had already read that webpage, but I dont need to change the data on
that file. I just want to create a new file and then close it, so I
can use it later in another system call, to mmap it to a user space.
Is it clearer now?
Can you please give me some code snippet?
Thanks again in advance and greetings!
Rafael Sisto.
