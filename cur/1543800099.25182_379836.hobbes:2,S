Hi,
I am running a 2.6.14.5 on a Transmeta Crusoe laptop (Vaio PCG-C1MZ) and
I'm having some troubles with the iounmap function. Each time I'm
shutting down the machine or even just stopping the gdm daemon, I got
the following error log:
iounmap: bad address d7233000
 [iounmap+197/208] iounmap+0xc5/0xd0
 [page_remove_rmap+59/96] page_remove_rmap+0x3b/0x60

 [sys_close+124/128] sys_close+0x7c/0x80
 [syscall_call+7/11] syscall_call+0x7/0xb
I guess the problem is located in arch/i386/mm/ioremap.c where:
write_lock(&vmlist_lock);
p = __remove_vm_area((void *)(PAGE_MASK & (unsigned long __force)addr));
if (!p) {
         printk(KERN_WARNING "iounmap: bad address %p\n", addr);
         dump_stack();
         goto out_unlock;
}
So, it seems that remove_vm_area is returning NULL, and I don't know
why... :-/
Can somebody help me out ?
Regards
