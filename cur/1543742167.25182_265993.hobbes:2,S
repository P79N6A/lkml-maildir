| Ahh. Now I get it. You don't want a stable kernel at all. You
| just want to pick and chose which new features you get.
|
| In what way is 'security enchancements', or 'new drivers', or 'new

| about in 2.6?

You try maintaining a feature patched kernel using things not in
mainline and you'll see.  Try grsecurity and reiser4.  You'll quickly
find Reiser4 to be at 2.6.8.1-2.6.9 (it's in 2.6.9 mainline right?), and
grsecurity at 2.6.7.
Now here's a real trick.  Try pulling it back out of 2.6.10-rcX, and
into 2.6.7.  You'll have to grab the fs/reiser4 directory, plus muddle
out what changes happened in VFS relating to reiser4, plus try to fix
whatever you just made explode.
Now as you'll notice, I've created a very shabby issue here; obviously
if I'm using 2.6.7+grsecurity, I'm not concerned with reiser4, as it
wasn't stable until 2.6.8.  What about if I'm implementing added
security using grsecurity/pax among others?  In fact, what if I'm a
distribution maintainer doing this?  New installs may use Reiser4; I'm
about to break them terminally.  PR for said distribution falls through
the floor, nobody uses it.
This may seem moot, but let's take a step back and say that 2.6 was
frozen at 2.6.7, and 2.6.10 is just 2.6.7 + bug fixes.  2.7 is in this
scenario taking on new features, but sanely, as 2.6 is now.  Some
adventurous users will use 2.7 and reiser4, others will use just 2.6.
Now I'll just patch grsec into 2.6, do whatever polish is needed if the
authors haven't taken the 5 minutes to keep up with mainline, rebuild
the base pie/ssp, set up pax flags so ~20 packages don't die from PaX,
and distribute.  PR goes up; and in 6 months a new stable kernel is
forked anyway, a few weeks later there's a new grsec, my distro upgrades.
As you can probably tell by now, my goals are very defined.  I have a
narrow focus here, which is why I really did lose interest in arguing
this a while back; but you're all so persistant to argue with me.  Even
so, my intentions are and have been to create a solution that's
simultaneously identical to and the antithesis of the current solution,
so that everyone (including me) can shut up and be happy.  The effects
are largely psychological and a simple display of macromanagment; and
all opposition has been visually simple obsessive resistance to change.
Unless you want to stop bickering about this and start working out a
clear definition of a better model, stop arguing with me.  It does no
good in either direction, as we can't change the model anyway until
we've developed a *better* one; so efforts should be focused there
rather than at the self-answering argument of whether or not it should
be done.
