on the Promise U100 controller without blowing the system - terminally.
I give up.
According to what I can figure-out from the programmers' comments, it 
/isn't possible/ to correct that with the Promise chip, because of some 
peculiarity they engineered-in,... BUT...
When the motherboard's BIOS initializes the chip I /can/ enable SMART, 
but then...
I can't boot without having my boot-system on /dev/hde, rather than 
/dev/hda...
Fuck it.
I /think/ that if the BIOS can initialize the Promise chip, that it is 
(theoretically) possible for the kernel to initialize the chip to 
function correctly, but if Promise /won't allow/ paid-for chips to 
function in a way that gives us the reliability-system we paid-for, then 
the simplest solution is:
1. note it in the config helpfile ( Promise-controller-section ) to NEVER 
cat /proc/ide/hde/identify
smartctl -e
smartctl -a
hdparm -I ( capital i )
&c.
unless the Promise-BIOS is enabled in the motherboard's BIOS settings ( 
this will reduce systems trashed due-to-ignorance in linux )
2. cease buying Promise chip-based systems for reliable-systems running 
linux, until they decide that customers are good, IF they decide 
customers are good...
3. maybe see what the mobos BIOS does and see if the kernel-driver could 
do that to get SMART to be useable on these chips irregardless ( 
love-that-word ) of the BIOS's settings
Thanks for helping me understand, and as Jeff Dunteman says...
   Keep on hacking
