It looks like problem hasn't gone away in the last kernels. The visible
symptoms haven't changed: machine is pingable, tcp ports which were in
LISTEN state remains to be in LISTEN after lockup, nothing else.
The last one is for different machine than in my previous reports,
so I suspect this is not a hardware issue. Kernel is 2.6.5-aa3 but
I believe Andrea's changes is not related to this problem.
