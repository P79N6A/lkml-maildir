Could you elaborate on the reason for the above bit of
code?  Is it to cover some thing from the past or is this an
on going issue?  I.e. will this disappear soon?  Is its
usage dependent on a particular driver?
Mostly I am interested in this because it may be at the
bottom of a VERY elusive bug (4 systems, heavy network load,
crash at 22 hours into the test).  Please help.
