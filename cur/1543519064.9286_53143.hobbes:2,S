The PPC headers seem to me unclear about CPU STOREs to memory being
carried out from CPU to system BUS prior to the IO/MMIO being performed.
On this example
extern inline void out_le32(volatile unsigned *addr, int val)
{
	__asm__ __volatile__("stwbrx %1,0,%2; eieio" : "=m" (*addr) :
			     "r" (val), "r" (addr));
}
I must be sure that 'stwbrx', in this context, does carry out buffered CPU
STOREs to system bus prior to the IO being issued, in order to assume
IA32-like ordering. You may let me know if this is true. Thanks. 
 
My concern is not to criticize or to change the current writeX/readX
semantic, but to be aware of how they are supposed to deal with ordering. 
I am able to add any memory barrier that is needed, if I can figure out 
the remaining ordering issues drivers have to be careful about.
By the way, I tried to find the PPC manuals on the Net and didn't find any 
pointer to such documentations. If some exists, I am very interested in 
knowing of them.
Thanks for your reply,
Gérard.
