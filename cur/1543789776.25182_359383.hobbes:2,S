Hi folks,
When I ran 'find /sys -name modalias' I got an error
message on stderr saying
find: WARNING: Hard link count is wrong for /sys/devices: this may be a bug in your filesystem driver.  Automatically turning on find's -noleaf option.  Earlier results may have failed to include directories that should have been searched.
uname -a:
Linux pluto 2.6.13.4 #1 Sun Oct 16 22:41:26 CEST 2005 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Harri
