I have v2.2.1 of the kernel, a Colorado 250 tape drive with an
FC-20 controller. I used it to create eight backup tapes 
successfully over the past two evenings, but it has now gotten
in a state where the kernel (or the ftape or zftape module)
thinks it's busy. It won't let me rmmod zftape either.
Here's the strace from an "mt" command, but it's not very
interesting:
-----
execve("./mt", ["./mt", "-f", "/dev/ftape", "retens"], [/* 25 vars */]) = 0
personality(0 /* PER_??? */)            = 0
getpid()                                = 31369
open(ptrace: umoven: Input/output error
0xbffffdc5, O_RDONLY)              = -1 EBUSY (Device or resource busy)
write(2, "./mt: ", 6./mt: )                   = 6
write(2, "/dev/ftape", 10/dev/ftape)              = 10
write(2, ": Device or resource busy", 25: Device or resource busy) = 25
write(2, "\n", 1
)                       = 1
_exit(1)                                = ?
