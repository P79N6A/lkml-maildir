Yes, the daemon is mlock'd.

Quite. But with mlock this particular problem can be handled in user
space just fine. The only reason I can see right now for putting this
logic into the kernel as well is to keep the functionality around even
after task freeze during suspend / resume. On the other hand, I don't
know whether this is really worth the effort even though the time when
the suspend operation is in progress can arguably be one of the most
accident-prone moments (think of users packing their things in a hurry).
