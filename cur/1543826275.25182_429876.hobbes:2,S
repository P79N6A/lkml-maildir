which breaks ppc64 for hugetlbs at least.

ia64 and iirc also ppc64 have different regions in the VA space for
different types of mmaps. Hugetlb, executable, non-cachable etc etc.

the rules for mmap_base vary per architecture, and even per binary time.
In fact the meaning of it is very much free for the architecture to
determine/use.

and with stacks that need different alignment based on binary type (mips
has 4 or so of those) or .. or ..

no but it COULD be. I haven't looked at the ia64 randomization, but I'd
not be surprised if it was different

I think you totally missed the point. *I DON'T CARE ABOUT "BITS OF
ENTROPY" IN THE CODE*. The code cares about how much it is in actual
bytes. Sure when talking about it in documents or analysis it may make
sense to do the bits math. BUT NOT IN THE CODE.
That was my point, and all there was to it. You add complexity and
limitations TO THE CODE for no good reason at all.
