Sending a happy note to the Linux community..   uptime 25 days!
For what I do (which would probably count in the vicinity of what most
users do) kernel 2.3.40 looks pretty stable to me! Used it as a desktop
and for software development of my own for about a month now, and execpt
for rebooting into 2.3.41 3 weeks ago and having memory errors crash me
pretty good, 2.3.40 hasn't given me a single problem with anything. I use
eth0 and ppp 24h/day, ide drives, sb awe64.
Here's the stats/config file I'm using. Note that this file is Indeed
the config made by 2.3.46, however it's a direct copy from 2.3.40 via
'make oldconfig'. I haven't seen a stable kernel beyond 2.3.40 YET --
something always either doesn't compile or has memory problems that
crash several progs. (Can someone look into this? 2.3.41 and up).
