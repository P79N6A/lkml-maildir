I agree with Christoph, I'd like to see a small (and useful) example 
included, which can be used as reference. relayfs client still need some 
code of their own to communicate with user space. If I look at the example 
code I'm not really sure netlink is a good way to go as control channel.
kprobes has a rather simple interface, relayfs is more complex and I think 
it's a good idea to provide some sane and complete example code to copy 
from.
Looking through the patch there are still a few areas I'm concerned about:
- the usage of atomic_t look a little silly, there is only a single 
writer and probably needs some cache line optimisations
- I would prefer "unsigned int" over just "unsigned"
- the padding/commit arrays can be easily managed by the client
- overwrite mode can be implemented via the buffer switch callback
In general I'm not against merging, but I have a few ideas for further 
cleanups/optimisations and it really would help to have some useful 
example code (e.g. a _simple_ event tracer).
bye, Roman
