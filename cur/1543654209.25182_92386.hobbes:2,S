Subject: [PATCH] give NFS client a "set_page_dirty" address space op.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/11/26/128

Description:
  The default set_page_dirty address space op is too heavyweight for NFS,
  which doesn't use buffers.
Apply against:
  2.5.49
Test status:
  Passes Connectathon '02, fsx, and other stress tests on a UP HIGHMEM
  system.
