Yes, read Christoph's todo list.
We need to separate out bits specific to parallel SCSI, moving the bits 
to transport-specific code, since SAS doesn't need them.

No.  I'm much more willing to help integrate aic94xx and 
Broadcom/ServerWorks into the existing SCSI core, working with the 
community.
As Andrew guessed, it's a way to get you your own playpen, where you 
won't be constrained by members of the Linux-SCSI community.
