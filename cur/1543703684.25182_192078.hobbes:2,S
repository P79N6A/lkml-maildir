Hi there,
I try to compile the 2.6.1 kernel downloaded from www.kernel.org.
Everything seems ok until I give the "make install" command when I got 
the following message:
[root@fuji linux-2.6.1]# make install
make[1]: `arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
   CHK     include/linux/compile.h
Kernel: arch/i386/boot/bzImage is ready
sh /root/linux-2.6.1/arch/i386/boot/install.sh 2.6.1 
arch/i386/boot/bzImage System.map ""
No module sym53c8xx found for kernel 2.6.1
mkinitrd failed
make[1]: *** [install] Error 1
make: *** [install] Error 2
The module sym53c8xx is in the linux-2.6.1/drivers/scsi/sym53c8xx_2 
directory but it seems that there is some problem with it.
Does anyone know what to do in order to get the new kernel working?
Thank you,
Laszlo
