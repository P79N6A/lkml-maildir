Ingo,
You don't even know what it is enough to comment intelligently.  You can
write the patent office and obtain a copy.  The patent is currently in
dispute between Novell and several other companies over S&E ownership,
and there's a court hearing scheduled to resolve it (lukily I don't have
to deal with this one).  Nice thing about being an inventor, though, is
I have rights to it, no matter who ends up with the S&E assignment.
(dogs fights over a bone ...).
