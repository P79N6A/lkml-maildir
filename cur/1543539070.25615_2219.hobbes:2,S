Your devfs comments are inaccurate at most.  For example:
     What, for instance, would happen if you had more than 26
     harddisks, such as a large fileserver doing software RAID?
The 27th SCSI disk is named /dev/sdaa.  There is nothing funny about
it.  The bottom line is that devfs takes things that belong in user
space, forces them into kernel space, and then expects user space to
clean up the resulting mess.
