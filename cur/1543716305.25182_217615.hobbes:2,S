To clarify this important point, driverloader is a standalone project, 
and structured similarly to the HSF driver (all os-specific code is 
open-source allowing it to be used with any kernel or even 
theoretically any other x86 operating system).
Because only one logical module is loaded, and a single set of tainted 
messages bearable, the \0 MODULE_LICENSE() workaround is unnecessary 
and not used in driverloader.
