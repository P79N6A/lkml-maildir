So in other words, you're trying to tell us about what code should or
shouldn't allow into the kernel when you don't have even a clue what's
required on a purely technical level, or how the code gets into the kernel.

You're the one who was trying to paint it as a binary "either you have out of
tree code or you don't", even though the actual situation is much more
