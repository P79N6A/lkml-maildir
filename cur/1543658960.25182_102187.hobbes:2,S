I never said any of that, I simply said (in the above quoted message)
that I could make ham and eggs).  
I'm not interested in getting into a pissing contest with linux
torvalds, even he claims he doesn't have leadership skills (read his
biography), and I'm not claiming to either.  His programming skills are
questionable, because if they were so good then I shouldn't be seeing
hundreds of [PATCH] messages coming through every day.
By the way, on the topic of my operating systems knowledge, I should
comment that I later in life became a professional operating systems
developer working on real-time UNIX operating systems kernel, library,
and user-level code development.  
I'm not working now, but that is due to health issues.
