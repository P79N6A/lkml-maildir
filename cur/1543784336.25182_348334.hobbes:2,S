Hello,
I won't be harsh but google is your best friend and first source for it.
please take a look at:
http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT3855888078.html
They have a good guide and what should need attention in migrating to Kernel 2.6 
They also have related articles for drivers in Kernel 2.6,NPTL and such.
Best regards
