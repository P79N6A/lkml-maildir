    I'm going to upgrade to 2.6.20.x next week, probably, but I'm not
fully sure. Can your patch be applied to 2.6.19.5 or different versions
are needed for each and every latest kernel release? I've seen the code
in your web and looked like it will work in any 2.6.x kernel as long as
it is not very old, am I wrong?.
    If it can be used with 2.6.19.5, I can test ASAP even if I don't
upgrade to 2.6.20.x. I cannot reboot my machine until Monday (except if
a power shortage does the job for me, of course), but then I'll patch my
kernel and test LogFS. I'm impatient!
