If there is is guarantee fro the GCC Steering Comitee, that there will
never be any ABI changes generated from the differences there (like
structure padding on/off).
Maybe there should be sth. in the build system for that, which is called
$(call optimize_for_speed, $target) and $(call optimize_for_size,$target) 
which then can be added on a per file basis and per directory tree,
where it really matters and letting it to the default otherwise.
That way we can tune gradually and remove GCC options.
Simple implementation today:
optimize_for_speed := CFLAGS_$1 += -O3
optimize_for_size  := CFLAGS_$1 += -Os
Sam: What do you think?
