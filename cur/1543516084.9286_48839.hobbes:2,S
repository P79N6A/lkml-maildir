Hi guys,
I tried to make two floppies - LILO boot and compressed root to be loaded 
to ramdisk. The kernel on boot disk is 2.3.28 and I get unending sequence 
of messages on the console after it attempts to load the ramdisk:
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k binfmt-0000, errno=8
kmod: failed to exec /sbin/modprobe -s -k binfmt-0000, errno=12
errno=8 is ENOEXEC and 12 is ENOMEM, so I would guess 8 could be caused 
by me forgetting to compile ELF support and 12 by specifying the wrong 
ramdisk_size so I checked both and they are correct. On the LILO disk 
lilo.conf looks like this:
boot=/dev/fd0
install=/boot/boot.b
map=/boot/map
message=/etc/welcome.msg
prompt
backup=/dev/null
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.2.12
        label=linux
        root=/dev/fd0
        read-write
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.3.28
        label=2328
        root=/dev/fd0
        read-write
and on the root disk /etc/fstab looks like this:
/dev/ram0       /          ext2    defaults
/proc           /proc      proc    defaults
btw, when I boot with 2.2.12 kernel it works fine, i.e. I get to the 
"login:" prompt from mingetty.
Any ideas what could cause this?
It looks like a bug in 2.3.28....
Regards,
Tigran.
