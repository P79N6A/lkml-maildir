No. The purpose of power supply class is to report values in common
units. Not some random value that userspace then should guess how to
compute.

I don't think that converting X * uAh or uAh / Y to uAh is impossible.
I'd suggest you to convert the ACR value to uAh using fractions, see
ds2760_battery.c. Even if the final value losing precision a bit, it is
still useful to do CHARGE_NOW.
Of course, additionally you can create your own private attribute
which reports raw value, if this is anyhow useful.
