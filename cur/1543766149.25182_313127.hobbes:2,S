It wasn't a complaint --- like I said, I'm pleased!  I just wanted to
serve as a datum: one guy was surprised.
I wanted to put the interfaces list configuration into sysfs, but I
didn't really know how or where to put it, so I procrastinated.  Then
I created the module parameter and was pleased to see it show up in
sysfs.  I had read about module parameters before, but I had forgotten
about that feature, or maybe it's newer than the docs I read.
Thanks for working so hard to make sysfs useful.
