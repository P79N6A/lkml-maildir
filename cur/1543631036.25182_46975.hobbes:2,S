If it was my system, I'd rather have a P4 1.6
and 512 MB RAM for performance reasons
RAM is so cheap it would be insane to go
stingy on RAM

Very solid card - actually you can get MX400
with 64 NB RAM for $55 or so -
Basic X11 will work out of the box, but for
any 3D work you will need to download the
nvidia drivers from their website -
