Then get your code into the kernel tree, and you will not have to worry
about this "problem".  Remember, that is what we are talking about here.
If you want to keep your "compatibility" library in your out-of-tree
code, that's fine with me, I don't care.
It's when you try to push that into the main kernel tree that I start to
care.

No, that is not how Linux kernel development is done.  Come on people,
do your research...
