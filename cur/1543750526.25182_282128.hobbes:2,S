So we're one step further, it seems.

Did that last night. You are right -- it is so slow that it is no fun
at all. So I started the test run last night and went to bed. 
This morning, the machine had crashed again, but unlike the noisy
crashes, when there was output on the console, this time, with
debugging compiled in, it crashed entirely silently. There was no info
on the console and none in the syslog, it just stopped.
Anything else I can try to help?
Anyone else willing to join the slab corruption bug hunt? :)
Regards,
Georg
