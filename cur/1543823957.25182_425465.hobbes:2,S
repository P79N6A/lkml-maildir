We use various values of b_size when using a buffer_head for gathering a
disk mapping.  See, for example, fs/direct-io.c:get_more_blocks().
I don't think we ever play such tricks when a bh is used as an IO
container.  But we might - I see nothing in submit_bh() which would prevent
it.
btw, it seems odd to me that we're trying to handle the
device-too-large-for-sector_t problem at the submit_bh() level.  What
happens if someone uses submit_bio()?  Isn't it something we can check at
mount time, or partition parsing, or...?
