It is absolutely needed. Without it, people will really experience a
long term problem with hanging templates in IPVS, manifesting itself
depending on time and hardware configuration. So I insist that you merge
this patch _NOW_ :).
I'm checking another issue with an asymmetric reference counting which
is not a bug per se (so far) but could serve you with a plate of
unwelcome surprises in the long run as well. This, however is
post-2.4.32 material because I need a couple of 1000s test runs to check
all invariants and configurations.

Perfect, thanks.

I understand. It took me one week to set this up. Reading the code alone
only made me suspicious.
Have a nice day,
