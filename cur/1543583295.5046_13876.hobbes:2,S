To clearify: The incompatibility only affects the hotplug kernel device
tables ... 
As there was no support amongst USB crowds for adding a version info for the
table formats, the modutils-2.4.2 could not provide support for per 2.4.0
kernel hotplug device tables. Nor can 2.4.3. The rest of the functionality
is unaffected.
Keith, correct me if I misunderstood ...
