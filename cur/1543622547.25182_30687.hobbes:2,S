Subject: kernel nfsd consuming 100% CPU on 2.4.17 and 2.4.18 with reiserfs?

It seems that kernel nfsd consumes an inordinate amount of CPU time 
during writes on this machine. With a few hundred kb/sec being written 
over NFSv3 from a 2.2.17 client, all of the nfsd threads each consume as 
much of the available CPU time as possible. On a similarly configured 
machine with ext3 instead of reiserfs, nfsd consumes much less CPU time.
Is there a known issue with NFSv3 performance and reiserfs?
