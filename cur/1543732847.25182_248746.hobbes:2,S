In the database work everything is a transaction and the transactions
are logged. Reiser4 is fully atomic and logged. So to get the "what
changed and where" you just process the transaction logs from the
point of your last marked checkpoint. Hot backup db servers work this
way too by listening to the transaction log stream. You don't need a
daemon in this model.
