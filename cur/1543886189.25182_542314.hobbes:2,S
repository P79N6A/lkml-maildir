hm, DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_CACHELINE_ALIGNED is a bit of a mouthful.
I wonder if we can improve things here so that we use the runtime-detected
cacheline size rather than the compile-time size.  I guess not, given that
the offsets into the percpu area are calculated at build-time.
Did you work out how much space this change will actually save?  It
should be available by suitable crunching on the nm and objdump output.
