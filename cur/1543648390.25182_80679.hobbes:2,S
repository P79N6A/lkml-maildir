Anyway, ide-scsi should work as well as it ever did, which is not to say
too well.  It's just that the IDE native implementation is cleaner and 
simpler, and a _hell_ of a lot easier to use.
The scsi-generic layer is a total nightmare. If you want to write to the 
device that is /dev/scd0, you can't just use /dev/scd0, you have to use 
the right /dev/sgX, and the X depends on how many disks etc you have in 
the system and where your controller is. The amount of crap you have to do 
with things like "cdrecord -scanbus" to just figure out what the right 
device is is just ludicrous.
With the native IDE setup, if your CD is /dev/hdc, then that's what you 
use for cdburning too. Just do "cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc" and that's it. No 
made-up SCSI bus numbers, no need to try to figure out what the right 
thing is, no crap. 
In fact, I hope that in linux-2.7.x the SCSI layer itself will start using
the same interface, so that we can drop scsi-generic some day completely.  
The interface is totally generic, and doesn't have anything to do with IDE
per se - ide-cd.c just needed to be cleaned up enough to be able to use
it. The interface really just says "hey, you can push SCSI commands down
the request queue" (and ide-cd.c will take the SCSI command and convert it
into an ATAPI packet command - which is a pretty trivial transform).
So right now, you can do "cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc ..", but because I didn't
bother to try to figure out what the SCSI layer wants to do you can _not_
do the simple "cdrecord dev=/dev/scd0 .." if you have a SCSI disk. That's
nothing fundamental, I just don't think SCSI CD-RW's are very interesting
any more, since they are overpriced and hard to find. I hope some SCSI 
fanatic will do the (probably trivial) addition to sr.c to accept the SCSI 
ioctl interface.
(Hint for such SCSI users: you should just do:
 - call "scsi_cmd_ioctl()" in your ioctl routine, and if it returns 
   ENOTTY that means that it wasn't one of the SCSI generic commands.
 - make the request queue handler understand that requests with the
   REQ_BLOCK_PC flag set are SCSI packet commands, and "req->cmd" contains 
   the command, while "req->data" and "req->data_len" are the data for the 
   command)
 - make sure that an open() with the O_NONBLOCK flag set will succeed even 
   if the medium is not accessible (and will succeed even if it's a
   writable open).
and that should be pretty much it).
