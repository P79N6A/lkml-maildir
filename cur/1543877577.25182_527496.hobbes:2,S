Hi Adam,
hiddev will have to stay for quite some time, exactly because of backward 
compatibility with userspace applications/drivers that use it (I am not 
aware of many of them though, but apparently there are some). I won't 
allow it to vanish, don't worry.
We just have to make sure that new users will use hidraw instead, as it 
provides more flexibility for the user, is not dependent on the underlying 
transport protocol, etc.
