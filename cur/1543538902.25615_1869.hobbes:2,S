problem statement: printing doesn't work on 2.4.0-test4. the printing works
on 2.4.0-test1.
from 2.4.0-test4, dmesg; ( using lp=auto in lilo)
  parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [PCSPP,TRISTATE,EPP]
  parport0: cpp_daisy: aa5500ff(18)
  parport0: assign_addrs: aa5500ff(18)
  parport0: Printer, Canon BJC-265SP
  pty: 256 Unix98 ptys configured
  lp: driver loaded but no devices found
the kernel is the same config for 2.4.0-test1. From 2.4.0-test1, dmesg is;
  ( not using lp=auto)
  parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [PCSPP]
  pty: 256 Unix98 ptys configured
  lp0: using parport0 (polling).
have try adding parameters like lp=parport, lp=0x387 to lilo etc but still
fail. I think it has something to do with /dev/lp* and /dev/parport*.
