It has been working relatively well for me in benchmarks (I'm actually
using 2.4 ext3 for my real filesystems, with backups of course ;-).
Performance of the page-cache directories up for directory operations,
but strangely file read performance is down.  Anyone else noticed this?
I saw this repeatedly using the reiserfs mongo benchmark.
Cheers, Andreas
