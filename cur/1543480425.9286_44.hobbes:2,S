NO. That phrase in Intel docs means that you can invent some
virtual memory manager which will use both segment selector
and offset (16 bit & 32 bit wide) to identify a virtual memory
location.
Thus max *virtual memory addr space* for 386 is 2^48 bytes.
Linux don't use all this stuff, AFAIK in Linux we have
"flat" memory model with only 2^32 address space for each task.
And it's wise decision - this makes everything much simpler.

Selectors point to segments of linear address space, which is
4Gb on 386. If you have two segments with total size > 4Gb,
they ought to overlap.
It seems you think that linear address space is bigger than 4Gb.
You may need to consult processor docs if you don't believe me.
