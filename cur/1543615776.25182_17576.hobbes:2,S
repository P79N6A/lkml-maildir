I will hold back any changes until all the details have been ironed out 
first and Al has given his seal of approval... To be honest I fail to see 
how one additional slab allocation will make any difference. Certainly for 
NTFS where we attach dynamically allocated data to the fs specific part of 
the inode (sometimes going via the slow vmalloc() at that) during the read 
inode call, I doubt very much that there will be any visible performance 
difference. But if it is decided that this is the Right Way(TM) to do it, I 
will of course go with it.

No, I was doing both at the same time and got slightly carried away. (-; I 
will convert the super block allocations to simple kmalloc()s when I get bored.
Best regards,
