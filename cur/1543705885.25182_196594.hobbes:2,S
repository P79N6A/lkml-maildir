	Hi.  I've just recently cleaned up a copy of the HFS Plus driver to 
apply to 2.6.1.  I'd like to submit it for inclusion in your -mm series, 
so I don't have to keep maintaining something that's out of tree.  HFS+ 
support is one of those things I'd like to see in 2.6 soon, so things 
like my Mac iPod and friend's HFS+ formatted firewire drives will work 
on my Linux machines :)
	I don't remember where I grabbed this driver, I only know it's much 
more current than the one at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-hfsplus.
   I've used it a lot for 
my iPod on 2.4, and have had success with it on 2.6.  I haven't done 
much with the kernel, so it may or may not be entirely a sane driver 
(please review!).  The only changes I've done to the stock distribution 
were updating some prototypes for type changes and parameter additions, 
and changing kdev_t_to_nr to the newer format that the fs drivers use.
