Well, as I mentioned in my earlier post, we have performed 
"micro benchmarking", which does not reflect the actual run time
kernel conditions. I guess u gotta take these results with a 
pinch of salt.  
But, you cannot deny that there r gonna be a lot of cacheline 
invalidations, if you use a global counter.  Using per-cpu versions is
definitely going to improve kernel performance.
