Sure, if you search google on the results from the 20 command, you see a 
lot of things like 0x64 0x64 0x75 0x74 and similar values.

Right.

Oh, yep, there we go... that's what's switching it around.

I noticed that the FreeBSD folks attempt to flush both kbd and aux:
http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/dev/kbd/atkbdc.c#L790
I tried doing that like so:
	while ((i8042_read_status() & (I8042_STR_OBF | I8042_STR_AUXDATA)) && 
(i++ < I8042_BUFFER_SIZE)) {
		data = i8042_read_data();
		dbg("%02x <- i8042 (flush, %s)", data,
			i8042_read_status() & I8042_STR_AUXDATA ? "aux" : "kbd");
	}
with different variations, and it seems as if it will go on reading 
forever if you let it.  So it keeps reporting AUXDATA as being 
present...  Hrm...
