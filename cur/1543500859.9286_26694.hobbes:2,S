Simply, there's none for now in vanilla 2.2.10. Are the video modes for
both of these fbs the same than those of vesafb? I'm asking this because
matroxfb (which is, on the opposite, very well documented) doesn't have
the same modes than vesafb.
What about special options?
Oh, and also, make xconfig will barf when trying to define CONFIG_ATYFB,
with an ERROR - trying to assign value to unknown option (CONFIG_ATYFB)
- make menuconfig doesn't have this problem.
