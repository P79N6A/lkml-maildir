Hmmm, I have one of these pieces of shit ... I have a boot issue with mine
on Windows too.  Graphics card doesn't initialise correctly on most boots.
Basically the rumours out there are that this mobo is marginal in an
undefined part of the agp spec to do with power levels, the reset line and
probabally the phase of the moon.  I have noticed that my machine will boot
more reliably when the ethernet card is not connected to the hub.  In my
case a long manual reset (pressy button) just after power on seem to fix
this from then on.  There is a site somewhere which shows you how to solder
some wire on which 'helps the +3v line' or something.
I hate this mobo.  But I'm too lazy to replace it.
