That's doable, but...  I'd rather not make it mandatory - CF is for
"specific for this build" flags and when used for parallel cross-builds
such requirements make it rather nasty to deal with.

Note that it's not just sparse.  There is a legitimate need to make
endianness of target visible to Kconfig - not to mention anything
else, there are drivers that are really broken on big-endian targets.
