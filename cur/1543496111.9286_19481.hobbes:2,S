  write() deals with data without assigning any meaning to its type and
structure -- the argument is void, and size does not specify anything but
the amount of data involved (and 0 is the special case). In the case of
message the pointer has specific meaning of address, and size is
secondary, derived from its type. If I know that the address is of
specific type, and it is NULL, it probably will make sense to put sizeof
if that type as the size.

  Address may have size even if it's NULL.

  It's already fixed, I just don't think that there are no others that
behave the same way.
