Thanks.  I'll try to reproduce the problem here.  What's your motherboard?

Yeah, still the same.  Your drives don't like the way promise controller
speaks to them (e.g. promise generates signals which are ) but now that
sata_promise has proper EH.  It can recover from those errors.  As long
as nothing worse happens, it should be okay.
Thanks.
