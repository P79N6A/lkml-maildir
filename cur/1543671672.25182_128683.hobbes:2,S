That's just a bug.  We can either go through and unmap all the pages via
their rmap chains, or mark the vma as nonlinear and just anonymise the pages
and to heck with the SIGBUS.  I'm not particularly fussed either way
really...

Wanna send patch?

The arithmetic in vm_enough_memory() is woefully inaccurate.  If you have no
swap and then build up a lot of icache/dcache, vm_enough_memory()
underestimates the amount of reclaimable memory by a lot and big mallocs
fail.  If the i/dcache has internal fragmentation it gets even worse.
I had a brief poke at that a while ago and decided it was basically hopeless.
I suspect that assuming "all slab pages are reclaimable" would be the best
fix here.
The ext3 truncate pages are those pages which are on the LRU and have
buffers, but that's _all_ they have.  They are instantly reclaimable and are
basically free memory.  Only nobody knows that yet, so vm_enough_memory()
gets it wrong.  The fix would be to nail these pages more aggressively in
journal_unmap_buffer(), or to account for them and include that accounting in
vm_emough_memory().  I'd prefer to just free the dang pages in
journal_unmap_buffer().

davem thinks we shouldn't need it, and I've seen no bug reports that indicate
that we _do_ need it, but Andi says we do.
Certainly something needs to be done in that area - a ppc64 box with 16G of
memory (all ZONE_DMA) cruises along with just 1M of memory free.
