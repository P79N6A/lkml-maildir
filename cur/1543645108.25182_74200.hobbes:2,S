Since your drive cannot handle 253 tags, when saturated with commands,
a new command is never submitted to the drive directly.  Instead the
command waits in the aic7xxx driver's queue until space is available
on the device.  In FreeBSD, this never happens as tag depth is known
to, and adjusted by, the mid-layer.  In Linux I must report the
queue depth without having sufficient load or history with the device
to know anything about its capabilities so I have no choice but to
throttle internally should the device support fewer tags than initially
reported to the OS.  You can determine the actual device queue
depth from "cat /proc/scsi/aic7xxx/#".  Run a bunch of I/O first so
that the tag depth gets locked first.
