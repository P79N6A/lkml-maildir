Jeff, for the hang on suspend problem, I know suspect something else in 
2.6.25-rc2 caused that.
Can you try the 2.6.25-rc1 version of i915_drv.c (in fact all of 
drivers/char/drm from 2.6.25-rc1) but in a 2.6.25-rc2 kernel?  I ask because 
2.6.25-rc1 suspends to disk just fine for me and resumes w/o a green screen, 
while 2.6.25-rc2 fails to suspend (hangs like you say) and gives me a green 
screen.
Were there other changes in ACPI or the PM core that might have caused this I 
wonder?
Thanks,
Jesse
