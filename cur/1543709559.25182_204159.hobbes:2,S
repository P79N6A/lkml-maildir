Humm.  Though AES uses GF's a lot, I think on 32bit processors bit slicing
AES just isn't worth it.
Though 512 byte fs blocks would only take 16 "transforms".  It's really hard
to implement ShiftRow() in bitwise SIMD...and x86 cpus simply don't have
enough registers (aliased or otherwise) to do this I think.  Fun read though!
JLC - bit-slicing MD5() will not improve things either, tried that for MD5CRK
