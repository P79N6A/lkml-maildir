P6b has three mem-slots. I would get "unresolved errors in init" if I
had 2x64+1x128 sticks, and I would get oopses if I had 2x128M sticks. So
there is indeed a weird difference.
I just noticed this: if I supply "linux-2.4.4 mem=255M" instead of
"linux-2.4.4 mem=256M" at the lilo prompt, it does work. Is this a bug
in the code that handles options given at startup-time? (I only tried
this for 2x128 sticks but I suppose this is the same for 2x64+1x128
sticks - I guess I'm too lazy to try it out).
