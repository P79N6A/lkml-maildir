The d_obtain_alias() function will immediately return -ESTALE if given a NULL
inode, though, and sometimes it'll return some other error.
It would also seem odd to sometimes return NULL to indicate an error, and
sometimes return a -ve error code to indicate an error.  Perhaps one or the
other should be selected for consistency.
