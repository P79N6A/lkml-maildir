One big patch for the whole kernel will not work anyway. You have to split it 
up to allow subsystems to integrate them in their own trees. With one big 
patch you would get collisions all over the tree causing the complete patch 
to get dropped. Also CC subsystem maintainers on their parts. And please send 
the patches as replies to the first one as it cleans up readability of lkml a 
lot :)

Yes. But I would suggest starting with the kmalloc()->kzalloc() things. When 
you do this conversions just remove the casts of the lines you're touching. 
This will reduce the size of the complete thing avoiding two rather trivial 
patches touching the same line twice.
