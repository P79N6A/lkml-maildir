I'm reading a buffer in the kernel, the buffer having been delivered
by a VFS write operation. But I need to interpret complete lines, so
if I get given a 4096 char buffer and the last linefeed is at the
4090 char mark, I reply that I've seen 4090 chars. The kernel
then gives me the remaining 6 chars again in a following call.
Great.
But I need the next 6+n chars, or we'll play this game forever.
How can I tell that there is more to come? If I try to save the
leftovers from call to call, how do I know that the next call
is the remaining part that I'm interested in? Or how can I persuade the
kernel to give me 6chars of the old buffer plus 4090 of the next?
This results from a cat foo > /proc/bar, by the way. This is what I
see:
  Mar 19 20:40:51 bambam kernel: write_proc entered with
           file c22ebc20, buff bfffd194, count 4096, data 0
  Mar 19 20:40:51 bambam kernel: write_proc returned count 4074
  Mar 19 20:40:51 bambam kernel: write_proc entered with
           file c22ebc20, buff bfffe17e, count 22, data 0
  Mar 19 20:40:51 bambam kernel: write_proc returned count 1
  Mar 19 20:40:51 bambam kernel: write_proc entered with
          file c22ebc20, buff bfffe17f, count 21, data 0
  Mar 19 20:40:51 bambam kernel: write_proc returned count 1
  ...
Well, the file pointer might be a clue, I suppose. I'm returning 1
instead of 0 to avoid infinite gameplay here.
