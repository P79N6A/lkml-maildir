Linus,
Happy new year.
I hope that the following patch will be included in the final 2.4.0 release.
Without it, the memory held by initrd ramdisk will never be freed!!!
Thanks,
Jeff

Subject: [PATCH,RFC] initrd vs. BLKFLSBUF
Hi Al,
Jeff Chua reported a while ago that BLKFLSBUF returns EBUSY on a RAM disk
that was obtained via initrd. I think the problem is that the effect of
the blkdev_open(out_inode, ...) in drivers/block/rd.c:rd_load_image is
not undone at the end. I've attached a patch for 2.4.0-test11-pre7 that
seems to solve the problem. Since I'm not quite sure I understand the
reference counting rules there, I would appreciate your comment.
Thanks,
- Werner
