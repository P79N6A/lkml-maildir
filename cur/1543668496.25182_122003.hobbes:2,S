Which means we have two orthogonal problems to deal with. Adding the
percent option and "fixing" it to take swap into account.
Not completely orthogonal, though, since the "fix" actually changes
semantics and might break some peoples setups. Take 3x50% of RAM and
twice the RAM as swap, for example.
