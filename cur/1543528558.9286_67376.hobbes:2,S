   I'm wondering about this function in mkdep.c:
/*
 * Handle an #include line.
 */
void handle_include(int type, const char * name, int len)
{
        struct path_struct *path = path_array+type;
        if (len == 14 && !memcmp(name, "linux/config.h", len))
                return;
        if (len >= 7 && !memcmp(name, "config/", 7))
                define_config(name+7, len-7-2);
        memcpy(path->buffer+path->len, name, len);
        path->buffer[path->len+len] = '\0';
        if (access(path->buffer, F_OK) != 0)
                return;
        if (!hasdep) {
                hasdep = 1;
                printf("%s:", depname);
        }
        printf(" \\\n   %s", path->buffer);
}
in particular this part:
        if (access(path->buffer, F_OK) != 0)
                return;
   It looks obviously wrong to me, and it breaks in a situation like
this:
#include "firmware.h"
where the firmware.h file is generated from another file (say firmware.s)
by a Makefile rule. Is there any good reason for the access() check in the
#include "foobar.h" case and not just for the #include <foobar.h> case?
   I see two options:
1) Adding such dependencies to the Makefile manually. This is how it is
done for some SCSI drivers. But doesn't it defeat the purpose of mkdep to
some extent?
2) Modifying mkdep to handle the case:
