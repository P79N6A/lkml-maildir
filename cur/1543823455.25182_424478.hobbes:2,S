sched_clock() probably isn't suitable for this application.  It's a
scheduler thing and has a number of accuracy problems.
But I thought we discussed this last time around?  Maybe not.
Maybe you've considered sched_clock()'s drawbacks and you've decided
they're all acceptable.  If so, the changelog should have described the
reasoning.
But even if so, sched_clock() isn't something we want to be exporting to
modules.
