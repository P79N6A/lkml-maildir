OK.  The current readahead and mpage code is really designed just
for ext2-style filesystems.  It was always expected that it would 
have to grow as more sophisticated filesytems put demands upon it.
Your change is a perfectly sensible generalisation.  The reiserfs
team have been making noises about lower-level readahead hooks as well,
and I think your patch largely addresses those.  I shall ping them.
