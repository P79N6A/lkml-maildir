The patch has been around on the dvb mailinglist ([PATCH][RFC] DVB
Hotplug Fix, 5. April 2007), Michael looked at it when I told him
about it again separatly (12. April 2007)
Between that there was enough time to respond on it or review it.
Mauro told me at the beginning if noone responds he'll go forward
somehow because it fixes hotplugging, and after 2 weeks I wouldn't
expect anyone commenting that thread anymore.
It would be better to look and respond to that patch first before
responding about that you don't like how it's handled, Mauro also
wrote in his announcement that people should look at the recent
mercurial tree and he'll revert it if something doesn't work by
accident before submitting it to his git tree... still noone
complained about the hotplugging patch in there.
