Another advantage of smpnice load balancing that I failed to point out 
is that it increases the chances that the tasks at the head of the 
queues within a HT package are approximately the same priority.  This, 
in turn, reduces the probability that it will be necessary to force one 
of the channels to idle and this will tend to increase the overall 
system throughput.
