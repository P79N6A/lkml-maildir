I agree here. It took 15 minutes to port thttpd to LT epoll.

I received a bunch of private emails ( ppl that are using ET epoll )
asking me to have both behaviours. The code require no more than 10 lines
of code to give both possibilities. We have two options in doing that :
1)
We add a parameter to epoll_create() that will set the interface behaviour
at creation time :
	#define EPOLL_ET (1 << 0)
	int epoll_create(int size, int flags);
2)
We can go at fd granularity by leaving the API the same, and we define :
	#define EPOLLET (1 << 31)
	...
	events = EPOLLIN | EPOLLET;
What do you think ?
