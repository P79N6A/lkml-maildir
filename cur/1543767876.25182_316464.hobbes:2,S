Well, my stress test works fine with your patch. I've tested it on JFFS2
FS which works on top of RAM-emulated flash. I tried it together with my
patch since otherwise the stress test crashes due to the race that my
patch fixes.
On vanilla linux-2.6.11.5 the stress test usually crashes in about 5
minutes, but linux-2.6.11.5 + the 2 patches (as well as + only one my
patch) it is stable for 2 hours already.
