The new code simply sets a flag as to whether instruction level
write barriers need to be used or not, it doesn't contain actual
code.
The older file (already accepted) does have some setup code, as well as
code setting flags, due to the fact that Bryan mentioned in his reply,
that this stuff simply doesn't yet exist in a generic form.   It's not
clear to me that it can ever be made to exist in a generic form that will
actually work on multiple architectures (or that there are enough users
to be worth trying).   We can make the attempt, but so far it's pretty
non-generic, in it's very nature.
