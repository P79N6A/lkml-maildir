There is an additional factor - dumps contain data which variously is -
copyright third parties, protected by privacy laws, just personally
private, security sensitive (eg browser history) and so on.
The only reasons you can get dumps back in the hands of vendors is
because there are strong formal agreements controlling where they go and
what is done with them.
Diskdump (and even more so netdump) are useful in the hands of a
developer crashing their own box just like kgdb, but not in the the
normal and rational end user response of  "its broken, hit reset"
