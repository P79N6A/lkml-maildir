Hi Andi,
Personally I think maintenance is easier if we don't try to discriminate
between the constants which require that macro and which don't require.
But if you don't like it, then its ok, I will only apply it to places
where it is really required and breaks the things (like shift operations).
Will do that change in next posting.
Thanks
Vivek
