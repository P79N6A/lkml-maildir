I see your point.  Thanks for the comment fix.
I've gone ahead and reverted my change,
since I think your original code is a little more
readable than the more-efficient-when-fcntl-fails code
that you're proposing.
	(set_fd_flags): Undo part of today's change: it's a little
	cleaner -- and more efficient in the common case -- to go
	ahead and OR in the -1 when fcntl fails.
