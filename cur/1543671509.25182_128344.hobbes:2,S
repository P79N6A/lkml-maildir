It seems you have a Red Hat Linux system. So, you should look for
glibc-kernheaders at 
ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux
 or from
http://rpmfind.net
.

I think this question should be directed to the mailing list for your
Linux distribution (e.g, shrike-list@redhat.com for Red Hat Linux 9)
instead of Linux Kernel.
