i dont think that exposing physical details to users is good at all. This
will come and destroy the effect of any possibly kernel-based page
coloring mechanizm. Also it's not complete. But it's a nice and valid
debugging aid.

this is debugging: make it optional and readable by root only.

which btw. already exists, and more (it does it with cacheline accuracy),
take a look at the memleak detector.
