This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.22.12 release.
There are 9 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response to
this one.  If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please let
us know.  If anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and wants
to add a Signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.
This should be the last 2.6.22-stable release unless we missed something
major and people complain loudly that we need to do another release.
These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the Cc:
line.  If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@kernel.org
to add your name to the list.  If you want to be off the reviewer list,
also email us.
Responses should be made by Monday, Nov 5, 2007, 16:00:00 UTC.  Anything
received after that time might be too late.
thanks,
the -stable release team
