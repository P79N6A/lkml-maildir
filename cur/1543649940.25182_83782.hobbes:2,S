Actually, what we were referring to is multiple complete, separate
processor cores on one chip.  Two complete cores turns in true 2X
performance, modulo cache effects, vs SMT which turns in anywhere
from 0 to 20% improvement.
MIPS does 2X processors/chip, and IBM is planning to do 32X.  I've
heard rumours of 128X as well.
