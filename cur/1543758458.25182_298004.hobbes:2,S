Twisted is doing this for the process writer doRead operation:
    def doRead(self):
        """The only way this pipe can become readable is at EOF, because the
        child has closed it.
        """
        fd = self.fd
        r, w, x = select.select([fd], [fd], [], 0)
        if r and w:
            return CONNECTION_LOST
This apparently means it consider the connection lost when
POLLIN|POLLOUT are set at the same time (which will never happen anymore
with my patch and that was happening all the time with the new
optimizations). It could happen with 2.6.8 too infact, if the write
buffer was empty.
But it should never try to read a writeable fd as you said, so I'm not
so convinced that what broke twisted is really related to the above code
or something else, perhaps the above is an hack for some other OS.
The reactor never listens to writeable fds of course:
        mask = 0
        if reads.has_key(fd): mask = mask | select.POLLIN
        if writes.has_key(fd): mask = mask | select.POLLOUT
        if mask != 0:
            poller.register(fd, mask)
        else:
            if selectables.has_key(fd): del selectables[fd]
So if there's a breakage, that could be just the process protocol, and
not everything else (the process protocol is a protocol implementation
based on popen but it's asynchronous with poll and it works the same as
the networking protocols that uses sockets).
I will ask to the proper lists, this is getting offtopic for l-k.

My point is that if we're allowed to return "undefined" then we'd better
return -EINVAL instead ;)

Agreed.

Thanks, I'll check it in the next bk snapshot.
