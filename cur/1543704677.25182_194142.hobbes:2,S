Yes, confirmed. My  version of gcc, I just sent you adding the 
-funit-at-a-time hung after uncompressing the kernel. I booted a secondary 
kernel, recompiled without it and all was fine again. Confirmed non-boot for 
2.6.2-rc1-mm3 but without a doubt for all kernels previous where 
-funit-at-a-time is active in the makefile.
