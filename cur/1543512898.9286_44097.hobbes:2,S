esd sucks because you don't want it running all the time and you don't
want the delays it introduces.  And all the old software.  How about this
solution:
   - anyone can open /dev/dsp
   - if more than one instance of /dev/dsp is open, the ioctls
     and so on are routed to a separate mixing module, which fakes
     the separate devices and writes to the real one.
This requires two bits of code:
   [ changes to sound driver ]
   - interface so that mixing module can take over existing and new
     /dev/dsp handles and fake their interface
   - when /dev/dsp is opened for the second time, turn on mixing module.
   [ separate module]
   - do mixing and fake multiple /dev/dsps.
