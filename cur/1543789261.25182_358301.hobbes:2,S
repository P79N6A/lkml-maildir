Not on ppc64. Our atomic*return functions have a write barrier before
the atomic operation. I think there is just too much code out there that
either expects implicit barriers done by atomics (abuse them as locks)
or simply written by people who don't understand those ordering issues
(to be fair, they can be fairly brain damaging).
I agree this is not a good generic solution though.
