Dear Marc,
Who decided that the goal was to become ubiquitous at any cost?  How
are you so sure that removing the incentive/reward for hardware vendors
to release open source drivers is best for Linux in the long run?   
In any case, should your goals trump those of active and senior kernel
maintainers?  They decided that tainting the kernel was appropriate. 
Forgive me for saying you seem more self righteous than sorry about your
underhanded dealings with people you claim to respect.
Regards,
Sean.
