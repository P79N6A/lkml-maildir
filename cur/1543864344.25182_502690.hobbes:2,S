Well I need in-kernel usbhid and the way this was implemented in 2.6.19
(and before) one could change pb_fnmode on-the-fly. This is mentioned in
all the power/i/mac/book tutorials and everyone is used to switching
modes this way.
I can happily patch the kernel to use the pb_fnmode but nonetheless this
is a regression to pre 2.6.20* and will confuse others too...
