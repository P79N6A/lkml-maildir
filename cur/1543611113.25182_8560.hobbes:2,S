  Hi, all. Version 199 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.4/devfs-patch-current.gz
This is against 2.4.16-pre1. Highlights of this release:
- Removed obsolete usage of DEVFS_FL_NO_PERSISTENCE
- Send DEVFSD_NOTIFY_REGISTERED events in <devfs_mk_dir>
- Fixed locking bug in <devfs_d_revalidate_wait> due to typo
- Do not send CREATE, CHANGE, ASYNC_OPEN or DELETE events from devfsd
  or children
				Regards,
					Richard....
