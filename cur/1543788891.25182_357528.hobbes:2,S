ok, please re-report if it occurs again. I havent fixed any preemption 
bug since -rt12, but maybe as a side-effect of other things? Some false 
positive latencies were fixed in the latency tracer, but since you also 
got xruns, they must have been real latencies. (albeit saving a long 
false-positive latency trace can cause a latency by itself!)
