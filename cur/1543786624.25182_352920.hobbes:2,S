Yep.  I did _not_ say anything about finishing to write a sector.
What I said was that there is only one case of a started and
unfinished sector: it contains partially old and partially new data
and nothing else.
And the difference (one of them, at least) between hard disks and
flash is the "and nothing else" part.  Flash may contain other
information as well or even be in a partially erased state, randomly
flipping bits in the future or not accepting writes.
