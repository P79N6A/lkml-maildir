Hi!

No, I'm sorry. And I have to apologize for being blind.
I was going to say 'this is very important, because cellphones *do*
have secondary displays, and we want to use them'. And yes it is
important, but you got the interface wrong.

So you have 128x64 pixels b/w display, and invented completely new
interface to control it.
Fortunately we already have good interface for the display... It is
called fbcon, and is more flexible than 128x64 b/w... but can do
128x64 b/w just fine.
Please use it. It is way more flexible, and it is right thing to do.
