            hello again,
     cant tolerate more this feature: just cant get
  this brand new preemption patch, just because ppp_interface_error_count
  absolutely_selectively_data_dependant increases!
     for interested and wanting to help:
 
http://tech9.net/rml/linux/patch-rml-2.4.8-ac12-preempt-kernel-1
    just cant get. no way. period.
     not closely related details:
  on my old 5x86 that was quite a curse: 2.2 - ok, 2.4 - silent death,
  85% of packets died on this ppp interface (that was another issue,
  and mostly wasnt data dependant(i.e. data dependant was 3% of all errors)),
  and also packets which had an unfortunateness to be received at one time
  with disk access also were 99% dead.
     here and now:
  doesnt depend on packet compression: deflate/bsd/vj - etc
  doesnt depend on v42 modem compression.
  tried 2 differrent modems(sportster 14400 voice/ Zyxel omni 56k).
  ppp 2.4.0.
  sounds for me like a ppp crc issue.
cheers,
  Sam
