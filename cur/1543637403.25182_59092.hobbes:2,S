Certainly if the controller is running in DMA mode. If running in PIO mode
I would think you could still have a problem if the transfer was stopped
mid-block. Perhaps I'm paranoid, is that a "can't happen" now?

I would think the guts of PIO block transfer would have to be protected
anyway, but that's a very small part of the code.
