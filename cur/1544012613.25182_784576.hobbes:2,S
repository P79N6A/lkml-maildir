I had a silly thought about scanning the source code for some kind of
magic declarator that would then be collected into a master weak symbol
dummy function kind of file.  It really seems more trouble than it's
worth; we don't have *that* many weaks in the kernel, not all of them
are trivial, and that way it's better to keep them as close as we can to
the point of usage.
