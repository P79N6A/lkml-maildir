The C++ freestanding standard is considerably better. I use C++ for my
embedded work, and I'm happy with it. But then again, I don't work with
a bunch of C++ Space Cadets who think that every language feature must be
used twice in each program before it can be considered complete. I agree
that poor C++ code is horrifying.
80% of the C++ standard can and should be ignored.
That is NOT to say I think the Linux kernel should be rewritten in C++:-O
It does make sense to get rid of some of the more blatant cases of
C++ incompatibility, i.e. stay away from C++ keywords. That's just a good
habit whenever writing C code.
