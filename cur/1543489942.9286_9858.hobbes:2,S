Hello,
I'd like to copy my NEWS announcement FYI. -- Ulrich
Newsgroups: comp.protocols.time.ntp
Subject: announce: PPSkit-0.3.9 for Linux 2.0.36

--text follows this line--
I've updated the PPSkit for Linux 2.0.36. This is an important update,
because I finally tamed the 200us jitter on the PPS signal that
prevented any reasonable work!  I strongly advise any PPSkit-0.3 users
to update. (Linux 2.2 does not have this problem)
If you want to verify the jitter quick, easy and dirty, you could use
"enable_pps -j -k </dev/your_PPS_port".  (The official way is to use
"xntpdc -c kerninfo"...)
Remaining problems are the receive timestamps wandering around, and
finally wrapping at the end of a time tick, and sometime no PPS pulses
are detected on the first open after reboot (I'm using loadable
modules for the serial port).
Along with this fix come a few other cleanups (similar to those in the
0.5 version)
So, as usual, here is the NEWS and the LSM.
Enjoy,
Ulrich
P.S.: Just in time for the CeBIT ;-)
                            NEWS for 0.3.9
+ Stole a piece of Pentium timing code from Linux-2.2 to avoid the
  jitter of 200us that makes the PPS signal unusable.  This fix
  replaces the patch for ``Completely Mad Time''.
+ Updated `enable_pps.c' from PPSkit-0.6.  Updated example
  configuration file for xntpd (3-5.93, used for testing)
+ Improved accuracy of `hardware_pps()' by getting the correct time.
+ Made `TIME_ERROR' less sticky, and relax some restrictions of
  `adjtimex()'.  Ignore the bug that has to do with ``STA_FREQHOLD|STA_FLL''.
+ This release is actually a branch release, because the actual
  development is at 0.6 (Linux 2.2) now.  Don't expect exciting new
  stuff here.
