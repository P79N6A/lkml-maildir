Hmm, thinking of a future swsusp2 with initrd capabilites encrption of
the suspend image itself is still useful to prevent data gathering after
resume. Using dm-crypt for encryption of the swap partition in this case
is useful during resume so this fits nicely together.
BTW: I spent my day on implementing the encryption of the suspend image
and will send patches after a few more tests.
