just to add -- I was following Alan Cox's suggestion of incrementing
"mem=N" and finding the value where the system stops working normally. It
was ok as high as "mem=3096M" but then I realized that I was also using
Zoltan's big-mtrr patch at the same time so I will retest the whole thing
without it... tomorrow.
Just to clarify - the problem _does_ show up without Zoltan's patch but my
"mem=N" tests were done with it so those findings are not really proving
much. I need to redo them with vanilla kernel.
Regards,
Tigran
