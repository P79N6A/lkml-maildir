Subject: [sparc] Weird ioctl() bug in 2.2.19 (fwd)

Right now I'm looking into why SNDCTL_DSP_SETFMT is failing on 2.2.19
sparc. I've been trying to get ESD to work on my SS20 box so I can play
music.
The situation is that the ioctl() is failing with -EINVAL for a perfectly
valid argument.
Here's the strace output from running ESD (snipped for brevity)
open("/dev/dsp", O_WRONLY)              = 3
ioctl(3, 0x6004500a, 0xefffe944)        = 0
write(1, "DEBUG: 60045005\n", 16DEBUG: 60045005)       = 16
write(1, "DEBUG: 00000010\n", 16DEBUG: 00000010)       = 16
ioctl(3, 0x60045005, 0xefffe944)        = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
The debug statements I put in ESD shows the right argument with the right
value is being passed by the ioctl() call. 0x00000010 is AFTM_S16_BE, by
the way.
I've had a look at audio.c in /drivers/sbus/audio (lines 1046 to 1144),
and everything looks correct, down to the parameters, so why is it
returning -EINVAL?
Weird. Any ideas?
