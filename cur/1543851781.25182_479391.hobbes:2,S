Hi,everybody!
I am learning how to add my file system.
Now ,i have add my fs called "myext2" with the magic number 0x6666
(" #define MYEXT2_SUPER_MAGIC      0x6666" in the file
include/linux/myext2_fs.h)to the kernel .
Myext2 is similar with ext2 but the name.
And i compiled kernel successfully.
And then i created my "myfs" in the type myext2
#dd if=/dev/zero of=myfs bs=1M count=1
#mkfs.ext2 myfs
The problem is after "#mkfs.ext2 myfs" ,how i can change myfs's magic
number to 0x6666 but not 0xEF53 which is used by ext2?
Thanks in advanced!
