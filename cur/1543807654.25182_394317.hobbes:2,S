  As far as I recall, some BIOSes can be stuck at handoff forever
waiting for SMI if this is not enabled. No doubt BIOS bug, and seems
like work around brakes some other systems, grrr...

  That's what I do not understand. SOOE is enabled only if BIOS ownes
EHCI - check for ECHI_USBLEGSUP_BIOS in previous 'if' statement. Am I
missing something ?
Thanks,
Aleks.
