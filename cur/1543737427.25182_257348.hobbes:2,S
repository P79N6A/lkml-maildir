Hi !
Just curious, but why ?
It would be useful to have this in platform code, I don't see why I couldn't
use copy_page() on ppc and I suspect it will be more efficient than memcpy
since it has specific optimisations due to the fact that we are known to be
fully aligned and the size of the copy is a constant aligned power of 2.
