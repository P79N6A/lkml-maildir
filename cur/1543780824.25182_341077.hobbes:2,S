I asked him not to. Somewhat at his instigation, I requested that he drop the
filesystem caching patches for the moment. I'm updating them and they'll be
back soon. Taking out this and the other remaining patch means he'll just be
given them back again shortly.
I know you want to ruthlessly trim out anything that isn't used, but please be
patient:-)
