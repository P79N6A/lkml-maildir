(As many people had theit changce to complain, but did not, here's the
next generation software disaster ;-)
Hi,
the year is ending soon, and in fact this year has been a great year
for PPS support in Linux.  I roughly made 15 releases of my PPSkit,
not to tell about the many many hours I spent testing debugging and
merging.  I'd also like to thank Meinberg in Germany for providing me
with a reliable PPS source (GPS167) that made further development
possible.
To finish this year, I made a new release, PPSkit-0.9.0, that features
a new hardpps() routine and some interesting features related to
Linux (update the CMOS clock chip). See the NEWS and README...
Here are the NEWS, and at the end there'll be the LSM file. Enjoy!

			    NEWS for 0.9.0
+ Merged changes into Linux-2.2.13.
+ Added new opton ``-P#'' to ``enable_pps.c'': Set the maximum PPS
  calibration interval (up to 32768s or 9h).
+ Updated ``TODO''.  Updated ``README'' (added performance data).
  Updated ``MANIFEST''.
+ Modified ``change_speed()'' in ``drivers/char/serial.c'' not to
  clear ``UART_IER_MSI'' when the PPS API is set up (just to make
  sure).
+ Added new ``time'' subdirectory (``pps'', ``rtc_runs_localtime'',
  ``rtc_update'', ``tickadj'', ``time_tick'', ``timezone'') to
  ``/proc/sys/kernel''.  Kind of experimental, mostly for debugging...
+ Added new variables ``rtc_update'' and ``rtc_update_slave'' to
  control updating of the real-time clock (RTC).  Now the updating of
  the RTC can be turned off by setting ``rtc_update'' to zero.  When
  setting the system time, the RTC will be updated once now.  The
  period for updating the RTC is also controlled by ``rtc_update''.
+ Implemented complete update of the RTC, including hour and date
  (replaced ``set_rtc_mmss()'' with ``update_rtc'').  Added new
  variable ``rtc_runs_localtime'' to control the timezone for the RTC
  (together with ``sys_tz'').
+ Tried to update non-i386 architectures as well (alpha, arm, m68k,
  mips, sparc, sparc64), all untested.  Please send feedback and
  patches!
+ Removed ``time_tolerance'' variable and use new ``pps.frange''
  instead.  The dynamic tolerance seen in ``adjtimex()'' is gone to be
  more compatible with the rest of the world (Well, it depends on what
  ``tolerance'' should be).  ``MAXWANDER'' is constant and quite
  large, accepting worse samples now.  Promoted ``time_esterror'' and
  ``time_maxerror'' to nanoseconds to allow small increments (I had
  0.2PPM for a longer time).
+ Merged changes for ``nanokernel #3'' (dated 1999-08-29).  Changed
  some spinlocks to be more correct (I hope).  Enforce ``MOD_PPSMAX''.
