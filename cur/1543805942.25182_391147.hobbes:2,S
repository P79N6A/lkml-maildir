Fixed in latest kbuild.
One day I need to get full grip on the module-init-tools stuff....

This was always possible using a kbuild file specifying all relevant
modules. But accepting this is not always doable kbuild now add an
additional method.
build module a
copy Module.symvers from module a to module b.
Voila, module b has full access to symbols from module a. This includes
module versioning support.
Both methods are documented in Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt now.
Both changes are in my kbuild.git tree and I will send out a series of
patches to lkml soon. It will be available for testing in next -mm too.
Thanks for input, and please let me know if you know of more
shortcomings in kbuild that needs to be addressed.
