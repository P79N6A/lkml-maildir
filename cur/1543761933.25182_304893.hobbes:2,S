Hi.

I've only also been reading this thread with half an eye but :
Would it be possible (in some logical timeframe) to change the
filesystem's on-disk format to support larger sizes without
actually changing the rest of the code?
I don't know where the 4GB limit comes from in this case but if you
would change the on-disk format, the format itself, then I would
think it would make it easier to swallow the filesystem and then
when it's in the kernel you can actually make it support more
than 4GB.
Then there at least wouldn't need to be a switch in the format
when it's in the kernel.
Just my thought - just feels like it might make it included faster.
And hell, if it's not possible, just ignore what I wrote.
