Subject: [2.5.69] can't open root device on md1?

Hello,
after some success on other machines, I decided to boot 2.5.69 on my
main workstation.
The filesystems of that workstation are completely SoftRAID Level 1
devices, except for one which is a Level 0.
However, while booting up, the kernel refuses to mount the root
filesystem. The arrays and everything seems initialized correctly, there
are a lot of messages from the md driver as there were in 2.4.21-rc2. No
errors.
However, the 2.5.69 dies with
VFS: unable to access root device "901" or "/dev/md1"
(I haven't attached any serial console so I'm doing cut'n'paste from my
mind)
Any idea why this happens? Have the device numbers changed?
Regards,
Julien
