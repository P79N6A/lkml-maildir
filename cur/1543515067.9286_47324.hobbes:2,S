Hi,
I'm trying to add some debug output to the non-real-mode
code in i386/boot/setup.S to display a few I/O port
values.  I've tried to use the prtchr and prtstr
functions here, but they seem to operate only
in real mode, not after the real-mode switch.
Any suggestions?  Should I be able to poke/write
characters into video memory for debug output?
(in a temporary, kludged fashion only)
Thanks,
Randy
