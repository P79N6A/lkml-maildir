I have no idea, this is how it appeared in the `nc -ul' output...

Yes. In the meantime I investigated, that the regression is between
broken-out-2007-04-28-05-06
and
special -js edition:
I guess it's time to end the staircase experiment in -mm.
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/js.bz2
 is my current rollup (against
2.6.21) minus staircase and related things.
I don't know if it's possible to dig out the patch list from it, otherwise,
2.6.21-mm1 list may be used...
