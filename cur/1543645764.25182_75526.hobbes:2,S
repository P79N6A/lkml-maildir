Indeed...  And I'm trying to merge it all now into 2.5.40.  Sorry I've
been a bit slow --- testing, especially error testing when disks fill
up, takes a long time  (How long does it take to write 4 TB to a disk?
About a day with the machines I have here.  Multiply that by three 
(now four with XFS) filesystems to test...)
