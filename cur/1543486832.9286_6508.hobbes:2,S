Telling it 'mem=128m' does the trick.

I've always left it on "Non-OS2", having used BIOSs from fu, gy, hn, and now
jj.
It's a single 128MB stick, Hitachi PC100 CAS3 and works great overall.
It's not one of those "overloaded" sticks that cause trouble on most
motherboards.
Win9x, NT4, NT5, and BeOS all detect it fine. I'll try Non-OS2 and see
if Linux detects it then.
