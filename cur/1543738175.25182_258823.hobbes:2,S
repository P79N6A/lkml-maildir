You're the only person in the world that (a) needs these hooks NOW and 
(b) can utilize the hooks NOW, by your own admission ;-)
That's the best reasoning I've heard for why a piece of code _shouldn't_ 
be in the kernel.  And I'm quite certain you are capable of compiling 
and testing the driver with a local patch held back from upstream.
Upstream is for stuff that's either finished, or at least usable...
