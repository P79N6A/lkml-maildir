We are having a great degree of difficulty getting Linux PPC20000
running on a Mac G4 466 tower with 128MB of memory, One 30MB HD and one
CR RW. This is not a NuBus based system. To the best of our knowledge we
have followed the user manual to the tee, and even tried forcing video
settings at the Xboot screen.   
But still, when we encounter the screen where you must chose between
MacOS and Linux and we chose linux, the screen goes black and for all
practical purposes the box appears to be locked.   We've also tried
editing yaboot.conf but can't seem to save the new file.
Any help would be greatly appreatiated.
