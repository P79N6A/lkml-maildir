a couple of months ago i used dhcpcd on a linux machine here at work,
and it worked fine. Now I need to use DHCP again (installing another
linux box) and I'm seeing the exact same thing as you. DHCP is also
broken on a PowerMac here. Windows machines have no problems at all.
I spoke to a network guy and he said the only change to the DCHP server
in the last few months is that Service Pack 3 was installed on it.
