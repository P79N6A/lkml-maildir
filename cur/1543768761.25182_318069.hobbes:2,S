Not that I am aware of. There are a few ICH/PIIX variants where if you
read status during a transaction at the wrong time bad stuff occurs
including to the block on disk. That may be what you are thinking of

The 400nS delay after a command is required before status becomes valid.
This isn't about 'incorrect' devices in the command case. It is about
strictly correct behaviour and propogation/response times. For the cases
its not required and you wan to keep PCI load down then checking first
is clearly logical.
Also btw beware of PCI posting - writel/ndelay(400) isn't going to do
the right thing.
