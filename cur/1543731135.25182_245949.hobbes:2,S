The only question is what it will take when there's a partially populate
mem_section.  We'll almost certainly have to allow it, but the real
question is whether or not we will ever have a partially populated one
that's not at the end of memory.

Instead of adding more stuff to the mem_section, we might be able to
(ab)use more stuff in the mem_map's mem_map, like I am with
page->section right now.
