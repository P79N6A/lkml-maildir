Actually host1 is created by the aic7xxx driver through registration
with the SCSI subsystem. The aic7xxx allocates the structure, registers
it, unregisters it, and drops the ref on it when it is done with it.
The SCSI subsystems view of hosts that have registered with the subsystem
is through /class/scsi_host.

Currently the scsi device in the SCSI subsystem is LUN.  While the
future may lead to having a having a target as a child of the host it
would be a large change for 2.5 / 2.6.

Each transport / bus may have a unique nexus between a parent and child.
Interpretation of a name outside of the name space registering or
owning the name would lead to bad info (i.e.  interpretation of these
two child nodes using the same policy "pci0/0000:00:07.1"
"host1/1:0:5:0/")  Enforcing a overall consistency could lead to
creating pseudo hierarchies just to fit a consistency model.
