 Why don't we rewrite the Linux kernel in C++?

I can't see it should be _that_ hard to make the kernel C++ friendly. At work 
I use a RTOS written in plain C but where you can easily use C++ in kernel
space (there is no user-space :-). We use gcc by the way.
It has been done for Linux as well 
(
http://netlab.ru.is/pronto/pronto_code.shtml
). Why can't this kind of
stuff be merged into the kernel? Why is there no efford to do so??
It is one of those projects I would have liked to spend time on if I had
any, but not if it would be rejected in the mainline no matter how little
intrusive it is. 
What I ague for is that people find out _what_ can be accepted in the
mainline with regard to C++. If the maintainers could somehow signal  
that a CONFIG_CPP_SUPPORT would be a acceptable option in the mainline
tree I am sure someone (not me out of lag of time) would make a patch and
submit it. I am sure distributions like RedHat would skip kernels with
CONFIG_CPP_SUPPORT=y once it was there.

PS. Do the above people break GPL by forcing people to accept a
license-agreement before downloading a patch to the kernel? Shouldn't they
provide a direct url?
