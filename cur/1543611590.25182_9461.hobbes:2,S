Hello theowl,

Well. Thank you. I've allready found this - in recent kernels it's
even regulated via proc fs.
The only question is why map anonymous is rather fast (i get
1000req/sec even then mapped 300.000 of blocks), therefore with
mapping a fd the perfomance drops to 20req/second at this number.
Any ideas why does this happen or any patches which increases the
speed exists ?
