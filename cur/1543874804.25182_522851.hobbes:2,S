Generally the way I've used this in the kernel is sprinkle them liberally
where I'm trying to track down a bug or understand how some code works
and then disable some of them using ZREC's but then reenable as
necessary. Finally, I remove them all usually by reverting to the original
code.
In userland I have a more sophisticated version which combines TREC's
and printf's in one macro with a "debug variable" defined as a
set of bits controlling the enable/disable sets of these. For example:
   DPRP1(1 << 2, "This is a DPR with parameter=%d", xyz);
#define DPRP1(__bits, __format, __param, ...) \
do { \
   if (((__bits) << 16) & dbg_variable) \
         printf((__format), __param...); \
   if ((__bits) & dbg_variable) \
         TREC1((__param)); \
} while (0)
The above divides "dbg_variable" into 2 16 bit fields, the upper 16
bits control if the printf is enabled and the lower 16 bits controls if
the TREC1 is enabled. What I envision happening would possibly
to expose the "dbg_variable" via procfs where it could "easily" be
modified from userland.
Anyway, for my immediate needs I just needed the TREC's so I could
understand the inner workings of the kernel better and assist in debugging.
I've submitted it as a patch incase anyone might be interested.
Actually, are you interested in using them?
In anycase thanks for the feed back.
Wink
