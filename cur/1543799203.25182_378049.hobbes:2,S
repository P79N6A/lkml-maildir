I'd love to have it fixed, but quite frankly, if the choice is between a 
boot-time lockup and not using ACPI C1 sleep states, I'll take the 
non-working sleep states.
The code in question had comments that didn't match what it was doing, and 
apparently the ACPI guys couldn't say what was wrong..
But it might make sense to open a bugzilla entry so that it doesn't get 
lost.
