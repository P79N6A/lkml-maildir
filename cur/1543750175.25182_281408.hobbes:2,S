Workaround it if it is possible.  If this is really a unfixable hardware problem
(hard to believe - other OS-es would be also bitten by the issue) shouldn't it
be workaround differently anyway by something like "ide=serialize_all" (which
is much saner from IDE POV than "idex=serialize") ?
The reason I want to remove some of IDE options is that otherwise I have to
add ~ 200 lines of ugly code for storing them in the temporary buffer (part of
dynamic ide_hwifs[] patch) and it still is wrong...
IDE option -> IDE core -> IDE host driver
while it really should be
IDE option -> IDE host driver
