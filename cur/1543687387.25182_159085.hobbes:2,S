Well, in theory..   The problem is that for irda to work, you'd need a *second*
device that did irda to catch the bits - and I don't have a good feel for how
many of the kernel hackers that would use this have a second irda-capable box -
probably a lot less than have a second box that does USB....
Now if that damned RJ-11 for the LoseModem was useful for something... ;)
