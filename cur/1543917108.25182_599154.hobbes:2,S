I used to have a patch that didn't completely trust that all files with
FMODE_WRITE set to have taken a write on the mnt.  I think I used a flag
to indicate whether or not a particular file had a mnt_want_write() done
on its behalf.  It somewhat artificially keeps the mnt write count
balanced, but I think it will let us detect when things like this go on.

Sounds like Christoph has some ideas...
