   If you do that, it's not the GPL any more, so what's the problem?
   If, instead, you struck the propaganda and the licensing terms you
   don't like but kept calling it the GPL, then that would be violating
   the copying terms.   At least that's how I read it -- I don't like
   the GPL and the FSF at all, so it's possible that I'm maliciously
   misrepresenting the FSF and the GPL.
