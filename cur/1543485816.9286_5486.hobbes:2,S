The I/O drives down the free pages enough probably.
You can't spinlock around the kmalloc either. The kmalloc may cause I/O
requests to be queued to enable kmalloc to complete..

Allocating over a page size significantly increases the change of failure
because its guaranteed physically linear - so will cause swapping
