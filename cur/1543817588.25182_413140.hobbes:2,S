These seem to be two completely independent problems. Reducing the
amount of duplication is a good thing all by itself that can be done
independent from finding a better way to provide the headers to 
user space.
About one year ago, I started down this route in order to autogenerate
something like linux-libc-headers from the kernel tree, but never got
around to submitting anything because I could not keep up with the
changes.
What I did there was to put a Makefile into each include directory
with a list of the files that should get installed (the list from
llc) and then add a headers_install target to Makefile that would
run each header file through an open-coded version of
'unifdef -U__KERNEL__ < include/$FILE > $PREFIX/include/$FILE'.
The advantage of this approach is that it minimises the amount of
change to each of the current header files while making it relatively
easy to audit by looking for wrong stuff (namespace pollution,
CONFIG_* dependencies, ...) in the installed headers.
