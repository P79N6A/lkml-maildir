Thanks to all for the pointers about "make oldconfig"  I tried that,
and it didn't make any difference.
I just compiled with SMP enabled and the compile succeeds.  So, there
seems to be some problem with a uniprocessor compile.

(Wishing I did have a quad 1.8GHz machine so these compiles wouldn't
take so frelling long.)
