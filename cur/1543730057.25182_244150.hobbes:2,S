My dad had a thing like that(quick reference card) for an old motorola 
6800(not 68000) processor. It only had 2 8-bit general purpose registers 
if I remember correctly. Doesn't even begin to compare with modern ppc 
processors.

Good idea, we should have something like two lists one for "chips" and 
one for "containers of chips" aka whole systems. That way it could be 
cross-referenced in a database-like way with a nice gtk frontend. The 
project probably ressemble the pci-ids project. That would pave the way 
for a free(as in speech) hardware purchasing guide.
