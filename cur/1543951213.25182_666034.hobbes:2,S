There's a newer patch in
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/10/343
which I think should replace the 2008/3/10/91 one, but which needs 
testing.
Jeff, does that one ("keep rd->online and cpu_online_map in sync") fix the 
problem for you?
(Andrew - I saw you say that the older patch fixed things for you, does 
the newer one - on its own - also do so?)
