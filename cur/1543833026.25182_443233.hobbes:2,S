It seems there's a third way to do this that would maintain setgroups(2)
compatibility and speed when you have a lot of groups.
Maintain the list of groups such that the first sixteen correspond to
what setgroups(2) requested, and keep the rest sorted. A search for
groups would then linearly check each of the first sixteen entries then,
if there's more, binary search the remainder from 16 to group_info->ngroups.
That'd allow this to be enabled everywhere (removing the CONFIG_
option), maintain backward compatibility, and still be fast in the face
of thousands of groups. The down side is slightly more complex code.
Well, and that you have to write it :-/.
On the other hand, as I haven't looked at the groups code, my suggestion
may be, y'know, nuts.
