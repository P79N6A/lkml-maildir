Not sure ... without debugging enabled, it's likely that you won't see
anything that early anyway :)

Yup, thanks. I think this should become cpb instead of cell, other cell
based boards would then have different ppc_md's though they could share
various routines.

Yup, I'm trying to get that changed in the architecture but even if I'm
successful, we'll have to deal with existing machines.

Ok.

I was tired :) If you "decide" to create.. will fix, thanks.

yeah yeah :) Thanks for the review anyway !
