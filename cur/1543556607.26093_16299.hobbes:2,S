I don't understand why you have set them to be slaves when they are the only 
drives on the ports.  Shouldn't you be setting the jumpers on both drives 
into the Single Drive (default) settings?  I always thought the Master and 
Slave positions are to be used only when connecting two drives on one port.
hda and hdc should be the devices.
