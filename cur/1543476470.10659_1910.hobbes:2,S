Hi!
Used gdb to attach to a running process under 2.2.0p6. And promptly
received 1000 lines of klog junk, most like
Jan  9 21:23:23 localhost kernel: Process: ipop3d (stack=c14abe80,
task=c14aa000)
Jan  9 21:23:23 localhost kernel: [<c014e371>] [<c015b352>] [<c013f55e>]
[<c013f672>] [<c01218de>] [<c0107a5c>]
Jan  9 21:23:23 localhost kernel: Process: ipop3d (stack=c14abef0,
task=c14aa000)
Jan  9 21:23:23 localhost kernel: [<c01077b7>] [<c01218de>] [<c01218eb>]
[<c0107aa4>]
I forget what lines like that mean, I thought it was something to do with
copying to userspace with interrupts off?? Never mind :)
I can lookup the symbols in System.map if needed - but it's easily
reproducible.
Cheers
Chris
