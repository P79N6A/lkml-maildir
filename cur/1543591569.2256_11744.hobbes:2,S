ioctls are evil, period. At least with these names you can use normal
scripting and don't need any special tools. Every ioctl means a binary
that has no business to exist.

It needs to read them. Writing doesn't add much. I'd rather see
trivial partitioning tools that consist only of UI code in case
of Linux.

So don't communicate them.

With statically linked binaries? How?

Uh-huh. And you can write them for ioctls. We had been busily doing that
for years. Results are not pretty, to put it very mildly.
OK, let me put it that way: I know how to do it in the kernel with
no code duplication and less impact on userland. BTW, most of the
code can very well sit in the userland, but that's another story
(userland filesystems). Anyway, there's only one way to settle such
stuff - sit down and write the patch. Which is what I'm going to do.
