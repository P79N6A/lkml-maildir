Marcelo,
Is it possible for you release pre's sooner than currently trend? That way
more people can get to try out the pre's rather than having to wait for
one large chunk. And if others don't feel like downloading the more
frequent pre's, they can wait longer to download bigger chuck.
Just a thought.
Thanks,
Jeff
