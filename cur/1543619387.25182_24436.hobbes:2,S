I drop back into real mode.  Run the existing query code, (I had to factor
setup.S but the queries are 100% the same) and then I climb back to
32bit mode.  But I do it from setup_arch() so if I don't have a
pcbios, I can skip all that nasty busyness.
I did it the wrong way (fixed table) initially and after some
conversations with you and some thinking I changed it around.
There is nothing outside the ELF specification that needs to be used.
All I depend on is having flat 32bit code and data segments, initially
loaded in %cs and %ds.  So basically anyones x86 ELF bootloader should
work.
I have defined a fully optional table of tagged elements, so the
bootloader can tell me what kind of firmware I have.  All it passes
besides that is the bootloader name and the bootloader version.  So
you must do the bios queries yourself.
