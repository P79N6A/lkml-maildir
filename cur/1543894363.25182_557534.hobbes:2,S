You *cannot* make GPLv3-only contributions to the kernel.
I'm sorry, but that's how it is. You can take some of the code that is 
GPLv2+ in the kernel, and MOVE IT TO ANOTHER PROJECT, and use them there. 
But not within the confines of the Linux kernel. Within the Linux kernel, 
the GPLv2 rules - and "GPLv2+" becomes just "GPLv2", since the GPLv3 is 
not compatible with v2.
This is no different from the fact that we have some drivers that are 
GPLv2/BSD licensed. Within the kernel, they are GPLv2. But on their own, 
you can choose to use them under the BSD license, make your changes to 
them, and release them commercially.
And correct - I cannot (and neither can anybody else) then accept those 
*non*GPLv2 changes back.

Actually, normally I *do* have such a trust. It's why I have no problem 
with drivers that are dual-GPL/BSD, and in fact, I've told people that I 
don't want them to turn them into GPL-only, because that is simply not 
polite.
But I hold *myself* to higher standards than I hold others. And in 
particular, when it comes to people with a religious agenda, I don't 
expect them to be polite or take my feelings into account. I expect (from 
good history) that people with a license agenda will consider the license 
agenda more important than any hurt feelings, or any wishes of mine.

I'm giving up. I'm moving you to my "flamers" list, so that your emails go 
to a separate mailbox that I read weekly. I've wasted too much time with 
you, your arguments don't make sense, and you seem to refuse to even _try_ 
to understand my position, or respect the fact that my choice of license 
is MY choice, and that I actually have a brain of my own.
