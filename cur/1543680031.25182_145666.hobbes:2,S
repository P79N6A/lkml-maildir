  What you need for that is a rpm spec file.  Grab a kernel.src.rpm from 
a distribution.  Install it, and cd to /us/src/redhat (other distros may 
have a different name in /usr./src).  Now the sources, and patches 
should be in SOURCE, and the spec file in SPEC.   Now you can modify/add 
the source/patches, and the spec. To create rpms you run "rpm -bb <spec 
file>".  Of course to get the i686 rpms you want you need to add 
"--target i686".
  Keep in mind this involves a lot of rpm spec file black magic.  Also 
most of time you will end up with at least 3 kernel rpms via this 
method.  You really don't want to do this unless you need to roll your 
own custom releases of a distro for some reason.
