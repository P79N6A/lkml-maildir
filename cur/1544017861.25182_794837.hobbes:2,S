> Introduce new libata flags ATA_FLAG_NO_POWEROFF_SPINDOWN and
> ATA_FLAG_NO_HIBERNATE_SPINDOWN that, if set, will prevent disks from
> being spun off during system power off and hibernation, respectively
> (to handle the hibernation case we need the new system state
> SYSTEM_HIBERNATE_ENTER that can be checked against by libata, in
> analogy with SYSTEM_POWER_OFF).
