You have just expressed my wildest nightmares. Just go ahead ...

You can only be plain kidding with this statement. If you split the drivers
from the rest of the kernel, you managed to get rid of this nice (yes, I really
meant nice) monolithic design, where I only need a simple config file to
_update_ to a new kernel revision (_up_, not _down_) and be happy (including
all the drivers). Obviously you just prove yourself wrong - mentioning not
working driver interoperability between NT/2K/XP whatever - with the idea that
it is indeed possible to make major new kernel versions (which should be
getting better btw) without _any_ changes in the driver framework that will
break your nice and stable but _old_ drivers. What's the use of this? You are
not talking about releasing driver-plugin-/framework-patches or the like just
to load _old_ drivers into _new_ kernel-environment?
Is this what they do at MS? Well if, they have not come that far.

This brings up memories about reading Peter Nortons' latest hardcore books some
years ago, brrrr.
Reading between your lines, I can well see that you are most probably talking
about closed-source linux-drivers breaking with permanently released new kernel
revisions. But, in fact, this is the closed-source phenomenon, and _not_ linux.

You just invented the circle with edges: you are talking about "long-term" and
"MS drivers solution" at the same time. Remember, this company is currently
saying the product cycle is 3 years. I know pretty big companies that haven't
even managed to get the NT drivers really working under W2K, and were just shot
down by XP release.
I tend to believe we could just wait another two MS cycles to have even the
biggest MS-fans converted to kernel-hackers, only because of being real fed up
with the brilliant, long term driver design.
