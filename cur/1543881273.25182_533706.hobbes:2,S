Actually yes. The idea anyway was to check one last time before declaring
ourselves as frozen. So I thought the best place was inside refrigerator since
we are already holding the task_lock there.
I wasn't too sure about calling recalc_sigpending(), but now that you
mention it, I agree, this would be a nicer way to do it.
Btw, since frozen_process is currently being called only from
refrigerator, I am wondering if we still need the struct task_struct *p
parameter there. It's very unlikely that some other task would mark a
particular task as frozen. No?
Anyways, Andrew, Could you please replace the earlier sent patch titled
"fix_pf_nofreeze_and_freezeable_race.patch" with the following one?
Thanks and Regards
gautham.

This patch fixes the race pointed out by Oleg Nesterov.
* Freezer marks a thread as freezeable.
* The thread now marks itself PF_NOFREEZE causing it to
  freeze on calling try_to_freeze(). Thus the task is frozen, even though
  it doesn't want to.
* Subsequent thaw_processes() will also fail to thaw the task since it is
  marked PF_NOFREEZE.
Avoid this problem by checking the task's PF_NOFREEZE status in 
frozen_processes() before marking the task as frozen.
