My only question is that do you know any LED hardware which can blink _and_
can set the brightness independently? If there would be such a LED I could
imagine that the brightness can be changed while the LED remains blinking at
some low frequency. For example a simple LED with brightness set possibility and
blinking directed by software is an example where the blinking and the brightness
setting are completely independent.
I agree, however, that if the brightness is set to LED_OFF, the trigger
should be also removed.
