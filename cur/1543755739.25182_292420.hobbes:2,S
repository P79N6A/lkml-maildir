   Definitely have been able to repeat that here, so the SG driver 
definitely appears to be broken.  At least I'm glad I am not going 
insane, I was starting to wonder :)
   I'll run some more tests with O_DIRECT and such things, see if I can 
figure out what the REAL max speed is.
  Thanks for the help everyone,
    Ian.
