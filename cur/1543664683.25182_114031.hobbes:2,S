That shouldn't be needed unless you skip "make depend" completely or do
something else wrong, or your "make" is buggy.  It shouldn't be necessary.
names.o depends on devlist.h explicitly in drivers/pci/Makefile.
As explained in the section "Multiple Rules for One Target" of GNU make
documentation, other rules (i.e. in .depend) don't cancel this dependency.
Further, devlist.h depends on gen-devlist, so whenever drivers/pci/names.o
is to be compiled, devlist.h will be created before that.

Not true.  2.4.20 is fine:
make distclean
cp ~/local/linux/.config .
make oldconfig
make dep
make bzImage
No problems whatsoever.
