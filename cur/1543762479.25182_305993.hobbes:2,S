You missed the point.  This has nothing to do with the crypto API.
Jeff is saying that if this is disabled by default, then only a few
users will enable it and therefore use this API.
Since we can't afford to enable it by default as hardware RNG may
fail which can lead to catastrophic consequences, there is no point
for this API at all.
