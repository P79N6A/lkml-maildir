The reason for having tunables is so the admin can get the behaviour 
desired. Since the kernel can't really know which behaviour to optimize 
this would wind up being the kernel tuning itself to your (someone's) 
idea of better. That may be great for some newbie, but honestly the 
default values put in by the developers are satisfactory in most cases.
I hope "as it sees appropriate" isn't really what you mean...
