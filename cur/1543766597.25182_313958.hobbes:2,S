I think that's the common sense in every carrier.
If we reboot the switch, the service will be disrupted.
The phone network is lifeline, and does not allow to be disrupt by just 
bug fix.
I think same kind of function is needed in many real 
enterprise/mission-critical/business area.
All do with ptrace may affect target process's time critical task. (need 
to stop target process whenever fix)
All implement in user application costs too much, need to implement all 
the application...(and I do not know this approach really works on time 
critical applications yet.)
There are clear demand to realize this common and GPL-ed function....
