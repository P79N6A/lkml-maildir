In drivers/pnp/interface.c, theres a couple of these:
@@ -264,7 +264,7 @@ static ssize_t pnp_show_current_resource
 			if (pnp_port_flags(dev, i) & IORESOURCE_DISABLED)
 				pnp_printf(buffer," disabled\n");
 			else
-				pnp_printf(buffer," 0x%lx-0x%lx\n",
+				pnp_printf(buffer," 0x%llx-0x%llx\n",
 						pnp_port_start(dev, i),
 						pnp_port_end(dev, i));
