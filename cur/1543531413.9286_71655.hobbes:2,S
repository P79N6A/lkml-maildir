Another possibility is to set CONFIG_IP_NF_COMPAT_IPCHAINS=y.
However, on 2.3.99pre2 that doesnt compile:
ipchains_core.c:148: warning: `ipfwsk' defined but not used
ip_fw_compat_masq.c: In function `do_masquerade':
ip_fw_compat_masq.c:63: structure has no member named `nat'
ip_fw_compat_masq.c:37: warning: `info' might be used uninitialized in this function
ip_fw_compat_masq.c: In function `check_for_demasq':

make[3]: *** [ip_fw_compat_masq.o] Error 1
