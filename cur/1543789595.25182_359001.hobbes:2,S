You do not have to be nervous, because USB ioctls are not unstructured.
These ioctls do not receive __user pointers, unsigned longs, or things
freely interpreted. They are defined to receive one buffer, and they
are not expected to perform any copy_from_user/copy_to_user.
The struct file_operations has ioctl which looks like this:
        int (*ioctl) (struct inode *, struct file *, unsigned int, unsigned long);
The unsigned long here is often a pointer to user buffer.
However, in USB case, struct usb_driver has ioctl like this:
        int (*ioctl) (struct usb_interface *intf, unsigned int code, void *buf);
The *buf is not passed from user mode. It's an honest to goodness
kmalloc'ed buffer.

From the above it should be obvious why such checking is entirely
unnecessary for the case of USB.
To be sure, one can write a driver which looks _inside_ the passed
*buf, and interpret the contents as a bunch of user pointers, in a
misguided attempt to create a DIY s/g capability, for instance.
If such a thing happens, we'd only have to identify the programmers
and impale them on a pole, then feed their intestines to crows.
That ought to take care of the problem without any checking lists.
