IIRC from a post a month or so ago, Linus mentioned that current 2.5.x
no longer had deadlock issues for file->file sendfile, which leads me to
wonder aloud,
Does this mean file->file sendfile can now be official supported in 2.5.x?
And more interesting, [thus the CC to netdev]
can we support socket->socket sendfile?
