It is obviously against 2.5.63 and applies cleanly..  Linus, please apply..
Thanks...Paul...
Changes include..
* proc support dropped in favor of sysfs
* other miscellaneous fixes and cleanups
* smapi.c changes and fixes from Wes Schreiner <wes@infosink.com>
1. When IR port is disabled skip io address and irq checks.
2. Actually compiles with gcc 2.95.4 when MWAVE_FUTZ_WITH_OTHER_DEVICES is
defined.
3. Makes error printks a little more informative.
