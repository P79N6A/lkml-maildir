I'm sort of forwading a message I wrote at March 13th that was never
answered and that I think has a huge priority for the sparc64 port.

In that case, I would repectfully comment that a special case comment
should be added to the lkml FAQ (chapter 8, section 2), because there,
it is stated:
"
    2. What are the recommended compiler/binutils for building kernels?
* (REG) This depends on the kernel version. Until 26-OCT-2000, gcc
2.7.2.3 was the recommended compiler for all kernels. On this date,
Linus announced that gcc 2.91.66 (aka egcs 1.1.2) is the recommended
compiler for 2.4.x kernels up to version 2.4.9. Gcc 2.95.3 is the
recommended compiler for kernel 2.4.10 and later.
(...)
            Always see the Documentation/Changes file for details.
"
At Documentation/Changes you can read some negative comments about this
version of the compiler, and it even says that is likely that 2.5 will
drop egcs workarrounds.
How will this be managed? What is the recommended compiler for 2.5?
