Hello!

Listen, let's close this thread. :-)
The patch sent by Matthias is enough small not to speak about some bloat.
And I see no reasons to refuse this: it evidently improves the things
almost without efforts. No matter that this imporvement is not so useful,
as it would happen if I guessed this way from the very beginning.
So that applications will have to worry about compatibility with older
kernels in any case.
(BTW Matthias, while applying it to my tree, I noticed that
it does not check for SIOGGIFNETMASK. It would be better to do this only
when it is meaningful: I see only SIOGGIFNETMASK and SIOGGIFBROADCAST).
