ftp.kernel.org will be taken down tomorrow, Wednesday, April 26, 2001,
at 11:00 PDT (14:00 EDT, 18:00 GMT), for an upgrade.  We don't
anticipate a long downtime: we're planning a two-hour downtime window.
Linux Kernel Archive Mirror System sites will be unaffected, so the
kernel sources will still be available through the normal mirrors.
--Up.
