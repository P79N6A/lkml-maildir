Well, the patch only has any impact when the order you are reclaiming is
less than PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER so I would not have considered it of major
impact to other projects interested in high order allocations.  However, in
isolation I have no problem with this patch and I can see how it makes sense
for the problem scenario described. I rebased just this patch to 2.6.24-rc7
and found no problems but I have not had the chance to review the whole set.
