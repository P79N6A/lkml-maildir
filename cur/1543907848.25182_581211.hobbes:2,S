On the other hand, given that we've always said that closed-source stuff in
userspace is OK, the only way to not let *that* horse out of the barn is to
not merge UIO at all.
If you have UIO in the kernel talking to stuff in userspace, you're going to
have to deal with closed-source stuff at the userspace end of the pipe.
Unless somebody can come up with some great feat of sophistry to avoid that?
