the way things works, if you give 8k readahead, you'll end submitting 8k
requests no matter how long you wait and it will kill throughput to 10%
of what was possible to achieve, very especially with scsi, max
coalescing of ide is 64k and btw that is its main weakness IMHO.
It doesn't make any sense to me your claim that you can decrease the
readahead by adding anticipatory scheduling, if you do you'll run
so slow at 8k per request in all common workloads.
