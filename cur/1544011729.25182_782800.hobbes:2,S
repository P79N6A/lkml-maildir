One or the other is probably redundant, but it's not 100% clear *which*.  :)
The line above was suggested by others back when the original problem
was being worked on for 32-bit.

I don't know if it helps, yet.  Needs a lot more soak first.
The theory here is, that all BIOS interactions from the kernel
probably should happen only on the "boot CPU" or on "cpu 0",
not just the "halt" sequence.
By setting the CPU restriction earlier in the shutdown sequence,
we should be on the correct CPU for all of the various device-driver
BIOS ineractions that might happen before actually halting.
Could be a bad theory, but I'm open to other possible suggestions.
Back on 32-bit it did seem rather unlikely that "disable_nonboot_cpus()"
would help, but it in fact cured the problem completely there.
On two different brands of motherboards with two different BIOSs.
