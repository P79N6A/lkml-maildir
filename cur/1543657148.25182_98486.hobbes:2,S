1. With kernel 2.5.53 and module-init-tools-0.9.6, "modprobe tulip"
   fails and goes into an infinite CPU-consuming loop. The problem
   appears to be related to the dependency from tulip to crc32. If I
   manually modprobe crc32 before modprobe tulip, it works. If crc32
   isn't loaded, modprobe tulip first loads crc32 and then loops.
   module-init-tools-0.9.5 did not have this problem.
2. The implementation of old-style MODULE_PARMs with type "1-16s"
   is broken. Instead of splicing the parameter at the commas and
   storing pointers to the substrings in consecutive array elements,
   the whole string is stored in the array instead.
   Consider parport_pc.c, which contains (simplified):
   static const char *irq[16];
   MODULE_PARM(irq, "1-16s");
   "modprobe parport_pc irq=007" should store a pointer to "007" in
   irq[0], but instead (unsigned int)irq[0] == 0x00373030, the ASCII
   representation of "007" in little-endian. (Kernel 2.5.53 on x86,
   with module-init-tools-0.9.[56].)
