The main difference is if the hardware supports rotation, fbcon will
present it with "normal" data.  With the generic implementation, fbcon
will present the driver with rotated data.
So we need a driver capabilities field either in fb_info or
fb_fix_screeninfo.

Not really.  We can dynamically rotate the fontdata using the default
display->fontdata into another buffer.  I believe I have functions that
do that in the patch I submitted.  (Sorry, I lost it when one of my
drives crashed :-(.
