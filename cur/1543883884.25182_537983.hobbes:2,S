Subject: [PATCH] [5/30] x86_64: Define IGNORE_IOCTL() macro for compat_ioctls
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/1/3

Define a new IGNORE_IOCTL() to let a compat ioctl not be warned about even when
it is not implemented.
This is the same as COMPATIBLE_IOCTL internally, but better self documentng.
Valid reasons to use this:
- It is implemented with ->compat_ioctl on some device, but programs
  call it on others too.
- The ioctl is not implemented in the native kernel, but programs
  call it commonly anyways.
Most other reasons are not valid.
