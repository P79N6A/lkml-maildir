If a pci device is capable of dma (or issuing interrupts), it will be 
useless with pv pci.

No, an unmodified driver that, by using clever tricks with dma_ops, can 
do dma directly to guest memory.  See Amit's patches.
In fact, why do a virtio transport at all?  It can be done either with 
trap'n'emulate, or by directly mapping the device mmio space into the guest.
(what use case are you considering? devices without interrupts and dma? 
pci door stoppers?)
