Sorry to barge into the middle of the discussion here but why call
it PSX?
PSX was the workname of the original PlayStation and was then dropped.
The PlayStation was simply called "PS" and not PSX.
PSX stood for PlayStation eXperimental if I'm not incorrect.
PSX however is a new product from Sony that's a PS2 with some extra crap
thrown in.
Or am I misunderstanding and this driver is in fact for the PSX (the
new one) ?
