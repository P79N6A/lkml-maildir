I think I went through all of them, but I'll do again just in case ...

Hrm... I'm pretty sure half of the ones we have now are not fully
efficient, and they all do the exact same thing until they get all the
way down. The only real variation is wether to allocate on the way. Oh
well, nick has some bits too, I'll have a look at what he has already
done.
