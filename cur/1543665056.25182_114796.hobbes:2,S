That is why I was very careful with my its -> it's patch.
In the two files where an extra apostrophe would have broken
the build, I changed its to it is.  Why not just leave it alone?
Because some well-meaning spelling fixer may come along in the
future and break it, just like in proc-fns.h.

It's too bad that the cant -> can't change is tarred with the same brush
as thresold -> threshold and asociation -> association.  My belief is
that those kind of fixes have these benefits:
The comments are more readable.
The source can be grepped more accurately.
Correct spelling sets a good example.
Incorrect spelling sets a bad example and proliferates.
Why all the fixes now?  Because it's a window of opportunity. Linus
seems more comfortable with accepting these kind of changes now than at
other times.
If we don't get these changes in now, expect to have this same
conversation around 2.9.50 or so. (Assuming that 3.0 will follow 2.6)
Cheers,
Steven
