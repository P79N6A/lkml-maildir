I think it would be a step in the wrong direction: poll should go away 
from a simple wake-up to an interface that transfers the band info 
(POLL_IN, POLL_OUT, etc). Right now at least two passes over the f_poll 
functions are necessary, because the info which event actually triggered 
is lost. kill_fasync transfers the band info, thus I don't want to 
remove it.

It's a good idea, but requires lots of changes - perhaps it will be 
necessary to change the pollwait and f_poll prototypes.
