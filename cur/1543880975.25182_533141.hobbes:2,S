okay, it seems it was less work to backport it to v2.6.20 than it was to 
answer all the "where's the v2.6.20 version?" emails ;-) You can 
download the v2.6.20.7 version of CFS from:
    
http://redhat.com/~mingo/cfs-scheduler/sched-cfs-v4-v2.6.20.7.patch
let me know how well it works for you and how it compares to the vanilla 
scheduler and/or other schedulers you might have tried.
