Eeek!  No, I took that out back in test9-pre7 to solve the ordering
problem that we were having (the hub driver's __init function in the
usbcore.o needed to be called _before_ the other driver's __init
functions when everything is compiled into the kernel statically,
otherwise we get a whole lot of kernel log spam on startup, see the
exchange on the KBUILD list for more details.)
Bleah, if we had the LINK_FIRST stuff in, then this rule could go back
and fix the problem.  Although I agree that not being able to compile at
all is _much_ worse than having to put up with a bunch of messages at
boot time.
Any thoughts?
thanks,
