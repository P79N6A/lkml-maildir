Well, it's a "generic RTC" driver because it lets the arch decide the
arch-specific things, like how to access an RTC.  It really should be
able to work on any arch that has an RTC.

I don't know the EFI code as well as you do, but after skimming it I'm
lost as to what would need to be added to the genrtc driver, other than
alarm support (which is greatly wanted!).
