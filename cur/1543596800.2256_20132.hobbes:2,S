I also experienced some lockups under 2.4.6-pre, there was an OOPS under 
2.4.6-pre3 and some other lockups under newer 2.4.6-pres but without any 
error message. Each time I was running Mozilla 0.9.1 (respectively Galeon 
0.11.0). Fortunately, there were no more lockups since 2.4.7-pre (I didn't 
test 2.4.6 abundant).
