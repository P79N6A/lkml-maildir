But the overhead isn't specific to any given clockevent
device.  The same issue was reported on other ARMs.
The acceptable overhead is a function of system-specific
factors including load and CPU clock rate, not of a given
clockevent device.
I wouldn't think teaching multiple such drivers about such
issues could be better than having clockevents_program_event()
consider a system-specific lower bound ...

==============
Add a "min_delta_ns" kernel parameter to help systems avoid excess
scheduling and timer overheads.  As with init_timer_deferrable(),
this batches timer IRQs to reduce those overheads.
For example, on one ARM9 platform the timer IRQ takes 2 usec, but the
system then needs over 150 usec to handle scheduler-related tasks.
On such a system, applications using many high resolution timers can
work better if min_delta_ns is used to avoid scheduling timer IRQs
so often that no other work gets done.
