OK, I begin to understand this, there seem to be three different types 
of files changed by Jiri's patch:
1. dual licenced files planned to make GPL-only
2. previously dual licenced files with a too recent version used planned 
   to make GPL-only
3. never dual licenced files planned to make GPL-only
For files under 1. and 2. Reyk did contribute to dual licenced code 
without touching the licence, but I missed that there's also code unter 3.
So there is a problem, but not with the code under 1. (unless you plan 
to change the semantics of the word "alternatively"), the problem is 
with some headers under 2. plus the code under 3.
It's funny how Theo missed the part of Jiri's patch that actually is a 
copyright violation and instead complains about the part that is OK...

Sam also changed the licence of a file additionally containing an
