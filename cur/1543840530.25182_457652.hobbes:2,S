I've actually tried (E), but it didn't work as I wished.
It didn't handle well shared pages.
Then, in my experiments such modified scanner was unable to regulate
quality-of-service.  When I ran 2 over-the-limit containers, they worked
equally slow regardless of their limits and work set size.
That is, I didn't observe a smooth transition "under limit, maximum
performance" to "slightly over limit, a bit reduced performance" to
"significantly over limit, poor performance".  Neither did I see any fairness
in how containers got penalized for exceeding their limits.
My explanation of what I observed is that
 - since filesystem caches play a huge role in performance, page scanner will
   be very limited in controlling container's performance if caches
   stay shared between containers,
 - in the absence of decent disk I/O manager, stalls due to swapin/swapout
   are more influenced by disk subsystem than by page scanner policy.
So in fact modified page scanner provides control over memory usage only as
"stay under limits or die", and doesn't show many advantages over (B) or (C).
At the same time, skipping pages visibly penalizes "good citizens", not only
in disk bandwidth but in CPU overhead as well.
So I settled for (A)-(C) for now.
But it certainly would be interesting to hear if someone else makes such
experiments.
