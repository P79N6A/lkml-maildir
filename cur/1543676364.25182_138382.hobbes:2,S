This is correct. Driver sets up first 16 bytes and firmware sets up rest.
Busy bit is special, driver sets it and firmware clears it.

This is ok. Driver has to set it to busy anyway.
Coming back to main issue, declaring complete mailbox would be superfluous
since driver uses 16 bytes at most. The following patch should fix the panic
