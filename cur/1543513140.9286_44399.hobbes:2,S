Yes, exactly. i.e. what would have been egcs-1.2 has become gcc-2.95.1,
and the old gcc-2.8.x tree is dead.

Depends what you mean by `based'. egcs was forked from gcc a *long* time
before that. From gcc/ChangeLog.0:
Sun Aug 10 12:00:20 1997  Jeffrey A Law  (law@cygnus.com)
	* egcs project officially starts.
gcc/FSFChangeLog indicates that changes to gcc between that date and Wed
Jan 7 17:09:28 1998 have been merged into what is now gcc-2.95.
The changes that have been made to gcc-2.8 since then have not been
merged in their entirety. *That* is what's still being done (and Richard
Kenner's a damned good person to do it; after all, he did a lot of them.
(Plus, many of those changes to gcc-2.8.x were merges from egcs anyway.)

;) indeed. I like to think a smaller set.
