That was the idea, I think :)

Wasn't arguing that point by any means.

See why the builds failed (the logs should say), e.g. for elm3b6, the
x86-64 box:
arch/x86_64/pci/built-in.o(.init.text+0xa88): In function `pci_acpi_scan_root':
: undefined reference to `pxm_to_node'
and try to fix 'em. Buildable kernels (which has been a problem for
-mm lately, I guess, with certain .configs at least) mean testable
kernels.
Might be fixed in -mm3, I dunno (those jobs haven't been spawned yet,
it would seem).
Thanks,
Nish
