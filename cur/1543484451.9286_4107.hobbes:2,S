Hmm.  What is the architecture of the server you are running this against?
I see ~3.5-4 MB/sec. write and 2-3 MB/sec. reads between two Pentium class
boxes running 2.2.1.  This is with a moderately congested network using a
non-switched hub (i.e. half-duplex).

Preliminary benchmarks suggest that the new write-gathering is
considerably _slower_ between the same two boxes.  More later.
