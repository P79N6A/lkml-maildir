Ah, yes.  This was done on purpose based on the design parameters.  I needed the calls to work from atomic context (which smp_call_function() often is called under).  However, note that I am sensitive to the impact this decision causes and you will see that the lock scopes are all very tight and light (at least, IMHO).

Yeah, agreed.  I was aware of this potential race against the "for_each_online_cpu()".   However, I am not knowledgeable enough (yet) to have even attempted a cursory stab at how to support the notification mechanism, so I just left the gaping hole.   It will definitely need to be addressed before any serious merge consideration for whatever final form this thing takes.  I should have commented that.

I agree with you on principle.  Making unnecessary external calls within a lock scope should always be avoided when possible.  However, in this case I had the following design parameters:
1) "heap" allocations over something like static/stack allocations allowed a higher degree of parallelization while supporting asynchronous calls, which was an existing feature of smp_call().
2) The context in which the function could be invoked is beyond my control, and is often atomic.

Ah, but it was.  I wrote my own cheeseball heap manager ;)  And it was nicely abstracted and conditionally compiled in case GFP_ATOMIC (or equivalent) ever popped up on the radar.
The fact is, when deciding between finer grained parallelism and managing a simple heap myself....the heap code really isn't rocket science ;)
Out of curiosity and for my own edification:  What *is* GFP_ATOMIC meant for?
