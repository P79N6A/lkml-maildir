I don't think we should do anything but point it out for those writing
the hotplug patches to look for. There are enough interactions in
general we're not even looking for that making the whole tree
hotplug-safe is hopeless unless the hotplug ppl get involved with e.g.
more complete patches, being able to actually test things, etc.
