I suspect that the answer to my question is "not really", if so then
shouldn't the problem that you've encountered be fixed with a one-line patch
which removes <linux/ide.h> include from arch/powerpc/kernel/setup_64.c?
Please try it.

Such code is _broken_ (as you've just found out) by _implicitly_ depending
on CONFIG_IDE specific data structures and functions.  Please note that
<linux/ide.h> is CONFIG_IDE specific and CONFIG_IDE depends on CONFIG_BLOCK=y
so <linux/ide.h> should _not_ be included et all for CONFIG_BLOCK=n case...
PS IDE subsystem has allowed per arch/platform host drivers for years and if
somebody needs help in fixing the existing arch/... (ab)users of <linux/ide.h>
I'll be glad to provide it.
Thanks,
Bart
