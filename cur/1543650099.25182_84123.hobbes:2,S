OK. I made a simple boring optimisation to your patch. Shaved almost
a second off system time for kernbench, and seems idiotproof to me,
shouldn't change anything apart from touching fewer runqueues: if
we find a runqueue with nr_running == 0, stop searching ... we ain't
going to find anything better ;-)

Patch is probably space-eaten, so just whack it in by hand.
