Dick - I didn't work for Don in Boca.  I did know him, having met with 
him several times when he was still alive.  I worked from 1979-1985 as a 
consultant and eventually VP R&D, at Software Arts in Cambridge, MA, and 
there was a machine we developed the first IBM Visicalc for, in a locked 
room which required NDA sign-in, with a list of authorized employees and 
consultants.  The machine was a plywood board.   It was not a 5150, yet.
Note that I did not say I worked in Boca.  Funny thing to twist my 
comments into that assertion.
Note: I am not trying to say that I know everything about the history of 
PC-compatibles, nor am I trying to prove some kind of macho thing.  But 
I do happen to have a lot of practical experience in this space.
In particular, I am trying to contribute to Linux to make it better.  
Largely because I think you guys are doing a great thing, and as a user 
of it, I think it's a good thing to give back.
