Thanks for the info, Len. Although its odd that the Jean-Christian's
issue appears to show up around the time the fix you mention shows up. 
Regardless, Jean-Chistian has some sever BIOS problems, so until those
are resolved, I suggest he use the workaround (noapic) and ping us if
the issue persists once he arrives at a supportable configuration.
thanks
