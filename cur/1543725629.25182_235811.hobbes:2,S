I think your total_reclaimed fix is correct. I sent the same one to Andrew
a while ago, but I'm not sure if he picked it up.
The sc->nr_to_reclaim fix I guess is alright but a bit ugly. Setting
nr_to_reclaim it in try_to_free_pages and balance_pgdat is what I'm doing
now, but that requires teaching balance_pgdat about the lower zone protection
and takes a little more work.
