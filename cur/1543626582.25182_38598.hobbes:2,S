I think the real fix is to make sure that preemption never hits while 
current->state == TASK_ZOMBIE.
In other words, I think the _correct_ fix is to just make 
preempt_schedule() check for something like
	if (current->state != TASK_RUNNING)
		return;
and just getting rid of the current "unconditionally set state to
running".
(Side note: if the state isn't running, we're most likely going to
reschedule in a controlled manner soon anyway. Sure, there are some loops 
which set state to non-runnable early for race avoidance, but is it a 
_problem_?)
