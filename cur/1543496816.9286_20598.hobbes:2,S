Since almost all linux kernels lookup on my SMP ppro machine, I decided to
use my UP celeron for linux.
That was not a good choice so it seems, 2.2.9 crashes just as often, but
this time it can be easily reproduced.
By just generating high network load it dies quickly (within half a minute).
I'm using a 3c905 and an 8139 RealTek, both 100 mbit.
It happens when generating load on eth1 (RealTek). I haven't tested it on
the 3c905, but for now I'd like my machine to remain up for more than a
minute :(
