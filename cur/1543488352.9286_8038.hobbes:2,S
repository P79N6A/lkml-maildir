   (d) why not do it in userspace anyway? I did that years ago, although
   I "moved" files to /tmp, but it would be easy enough to move to a
   garbage/$LOGNAME directory on the same FS.
Absolutely, agreed.  As I said earlier, there are plenty of user-space
"rm" replacements, and doing it in the kernel is almost certainly not
worth the pain.
It might be worth it for the kernel to add a wakeup to the undelete
daemon telling it that space is low and it should remove some of the
deleted files, but I'd want to see how well a strategy of polling every
minute works (or doesn't work) before deciding whether the extra kernel
bloat was worth it.
