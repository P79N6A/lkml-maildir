There is probably just some miscoordination between the kernel
mainteiners, but anyway. The 3c59x driver shipped with all 
official 2.4.x kernels lacks the 'medialock' feature.
The result on 3c900 10M/combo cards can be unpleasant:
kernel log fills up quickly and only reboot helps.
However, Andrew's unofficial drivers at
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/
 work fine so this is 
just a plea to include them into the official kernel.
