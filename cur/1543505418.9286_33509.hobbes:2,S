Hello All,
I am having a RH6.0 machine with SCSI facility and kernel 2.2.5-15. I am trying to install one patch to this kernel and then rebuilding the machine. the procedure followed by me is:
#rm linux
#ln -s linux-2.2.5-15 linux
#patch -p0 < abcd.patch
Hucks are all succeded here and no problems
#ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/linux /usr/include/linux
#ln -s /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386 /usr/include/asm
#make mrproper
#make xconfig
Here as I am using P-II I do the processor setting to PPro/686 and no other major changes.
#make bzImage
#make modules
#make modules_install
#cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.5-15
#cp /usr/src/linux/System.map /boot/System.map-2.2.5-15
#cd /boot
#rm System.map
#ln -s System.map-2.2.5-15 System.map
#mv initrd-2.2.5-15.img ini-2.2.5-15.img
THis is to remove the old initrd.
#mkinitrd /boot/initrd-2.2.5-15.img 2.2.5-15
make changes in lilo for vmlinuz and initrd
#lilo -v
Then I restart my machine.
At the booting at "finding module dependencies" it stop and never comes up. I waited for as long as 3 hours to come up. This happened thrice with one machine and so I tried the same on other machine. It also failed with the same problem. Please help me where I am exactly going wrong and what can be the actual problem.
Sorry for such a long mail
Thanking You,
Alpesh
