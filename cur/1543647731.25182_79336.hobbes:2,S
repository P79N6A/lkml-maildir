   Oh yes there is.  What if an allocation of blocks and/or inodes is
   preempted?  Another thread could attempt to allocate the same set of
   blocks and/or inodes.
   
That's why we protect the allocation with SMP locking primitives
which under Linux prevent preemption.
This isn't rocket science, the IP networking is fully threaded for
example and I consider that about as hard to thread as something like
ext2/ext3 inode/block allocation.
Also, as Andi Kleen noted, it's actually filesystem dependant whether
the inode/block allocation is threaded or not.
