Hi Andrew. Here follows a number of kbuild patches.
The first replaces kbuild-specify-default-target-during-configuration.patch
They have seen ligiht testing here, but on the other hand the do not touch
any critical part of kbuild.
Patches:
default kernel image:		Specify default target at config
				time rather then hardcode it.
				Only enabled for i386 for now.
move rpm to scripts/package: 	Move rpm support so we are ready for
				more package types
add deb-pkg target:		Pack kernel in debian format
make clean improved:		make clean removes a few more files
external module build doc:	Add documentation for building external modules
Above changes can be pulled from linux-sam.bkbits.net/kbuild:
bk pull bk://linux-sam.bkbits.net/kbuild
(Being updated as I type)
Patches follows as individual mails.
If anyone like to cook up a targz-pkg target please feel free.
	Sam
