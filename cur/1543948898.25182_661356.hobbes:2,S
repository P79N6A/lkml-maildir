The reason we are trying to go through the standards process in the
first place is that there is a desire to use SELinux with large netapp
storage boxes. I don't believe that netapp supports the existing
side-band protocol for NFSv4 and the impression I got was that they we
were going to have an incredibly hard time convincing them of putting
anything in that isn't part of the standard. It seems that adding one
recommended attribute which is described in a 3 page internet draft(Most
of which is BS that is part of the template) would be significantly
easier to get into the standard than trying to push an out of band xattr
protocol. Also, I believe Trond even expressed some discontent with it a
while back when we first started development.

I can always go with the original hook name of get_security_xattr_name
which turns into a security_get_security_xattr_name call which seems a
bit ludicrous. The only other complaint that I saw from Casey besides
the name of the function was that there could be more than one xattr. If
we want to address that then I need another hook that says give me all
data that the LSM deems important for this file. Which is essentially
the same thing as taking each of the xattr names that the module will
provide, grabbing each of them in turn, and concatenating them together.
For SELinux this is no different than getsecurity with the selinux
suffix. The same goes for SMACK.
