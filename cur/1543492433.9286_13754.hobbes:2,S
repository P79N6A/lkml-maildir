The kernel already has code to handle AT commands, as part of the
modem emulation included with the ISDN drivers. You can share it,
to avoid bloat and bugs. (there were buffer overflows at one time)
The kernel already has a software modem for radio. You might consider
supporting the "wrong" protocol for both device types. Then users
could do v.90 on a radio and FSK9600 on a phone.
You might want to look at the PC speaker driver. It has some odd code
that gets the job done, though it messes up the clock AFAIK.
Just in case you didn't know: you must not use floating point math
in kernel code. If you really need it, you might save and restore
the registers like the soundmodem code does. If you make a mistake,
normal unrelated programs will get corrupt floating point registers.
Another thing: don't try using C++ in the kernel. If you have trouble
converting to C, ask for help. Linux uses gcc, with plenty of useful
extensions that can take the place of C++ features.
Next time you post about this, consider a subject line that won't
make many of the best people ignore you. I'm sure that almost
everyone assumed that you were just complaining about WinModem support.
Try this: "I have partial WinModem code (no joke)".
BTW, you didn't say exactly what you had:
Genuine 3COM (USRobotics) WinModem (R)?
Similar device with Lucent chips?
Full driver, from hardare IO to AT commands?
Hardware-level driver only?
Hardware-level plus protocols?
C, C++, or C++ with Microsoft extensions?
