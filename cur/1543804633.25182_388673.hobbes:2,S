That's not quite what I want/need.  I want a stable kernel in all respects, 
one that has bugfixes and minor changes, for every day use, for building or 
deploying embedded systems on.  Yes for people who've got the SoC du juour 
the model is better, but for us poor buggers who couldn't give a crud about 
the latest greatest SoC it's a pain.
I think we can just let this thread die because apparently I'm in the very 
unvocal minority that is hurt and this change is costing more than others.
Right now as it sits, you have to bleed, or you don't get anything.  I 
think some more middle ground can be found...I'm just not totally sure it's 
wanted now after this line of discussion.
