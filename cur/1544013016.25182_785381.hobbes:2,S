Hello everyone,
I've done some testing against Linus' git tree from last night and the
current btrfs trees still work well.
There are a few bug fixes that I need to include from while I was on
vacation but I haven't made any large changes since early in December:
Btrfs details and usage information can be found:
http://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/
The btrfs kernel code is here:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/mason/btrfs-unstable.git;a=summary
And the utilities are here:
