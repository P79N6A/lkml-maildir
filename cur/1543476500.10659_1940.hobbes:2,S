I have a PC-Chips motherboard.  What is this about fake cache?
Is it possible my machine doesn't have real cache?  How do I
tell?  It supposedly has 1Mb of cache.  When I disable external
cache in my CMOS it slows down from around 1200 in Norton SI to
around 20 in SI.  That makes it look like there certainly is
cache.  I'm interested in whatever you can tell me though.
