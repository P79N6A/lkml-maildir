You seem to be SOL.  It's sad that you cannot make time or learn enough
to scratch your itch.  It is sad that you seem not to have even started
to try.  I weep.  When someone calls me on the phone and asks me to hire
them because their bills and debts are so large that they must get a
job, but can present me with no valid reasons to hire them, I'll think
of you from now on.  Oh, wait, did that sound bitter?

It's also sad that you have no apparent teambuilding or advocacy skills.
  If the technology is archaic and esoteric, then why should anyone
care?  If you cannot help but piss people off, you need to change tactics.

And, cheerfully pissing people off does in no way redeem you.
