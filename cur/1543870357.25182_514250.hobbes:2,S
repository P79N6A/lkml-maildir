Hi folks,
this patch fixes the floppy mount bug (i. e. regression) in kernel 2.6.21-rc1. It was inspired by Stephane Eranian. It was tested on an Intel P4 1800 MHz
(Intel ICH4 chipset) and on an AMD Athlon XP 1800 MHz (Silicon Integrated Systems chipset 740, 5513).
My deep thanks and respect go to:
Stephane Eranian, Linus Torvalds, Jiri Slaby. You are truthfully real men and reliable, accurate, fine chaps. It feels great to have you in this world-wide community!
Would you still call the whole i386 architecture "a small number of machines", Mister Andrew Morton? If yes, in how far please?
