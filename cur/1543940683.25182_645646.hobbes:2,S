The thing is that MCOUNT needs something to select it, it's not a visible
option:
config MCOUNT
        bool
        select FRAME_POINTER
Nothing selects MCOUNT before the annotations are in, which really makes
the mcount code a nop until the tracer code comes in. A bisect (as long as
make oldconfig is done) should not be harmed by this patch ordering.
Note: the mcount patch introduces the annotation of notrace, which means
switching the order as it is will break it.
