From: "Robert P. J. Day" <>
Subject: [PATCH] Introduce simple TRUE and FALSE boolean macros.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/21/19

  Introduce the TRUE and FALSE boolean macros so that everyone can
stop re-inventing them, and remove the one occurrence in the source
tree that clashes with that change.
Signed-off-by: Robert P. J. Day <rpjday@mindspring.com>
---
  once this patch is applied, others can remove all of the superfluous
macro definitions from the source tree at their convenience.
  this was compile tested on x86 with "make allyesconfig".
