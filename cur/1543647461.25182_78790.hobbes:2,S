You don't really want to do this. Imagine what happens if you get
preempted before you had a chance to run MOD_INC_USE_COUNT.

The unload path could look something like this:
	if (mod->usecount())
		return -EBUSY;
	mod->state = cleanup;
	if (mod->exit())
		return -EBUSY;
	(free module)
So this does what you want. The only problem is here that the exit call
can fail, because there are still users, so the module will stay in the
cleanup state. start/stop functions would give you better control over
this.

The current API just hides the complexity, but it requires extra checks
all over the kernel, to test if an object belongs to a module and if the
module is running. My proposal would get rid of this.
Deciding whether when you can release a device object or a driver object
is pretty much the same problem and a common solution is IMO prefered. The
module code should work like the remaining kernel and not require extra
care everywhere.
The diff below shows how filesystem.c would change, which becomes simpler
as it doesn't has to care about the module state anymore.
bye, Roman
