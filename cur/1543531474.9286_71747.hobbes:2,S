    No it doesn't.
    What it does mean that if a process writes a COW page and there's no
    space for the page, that process dies.   It does mean that if a
    process attempted to grow its stack and there's no space, that
    process dies.
    The computational overhead for non-overcommit is less than the
    overhead for overcommit + some all-singing all-dancing oom killer
    that has to make decisions about which process to kill.

    Sysklogd, if it can't malloc() for a message fragment, simply logs
    that it can't get memory and continues.

    So it drops the traffic on the floor (while complaining bitterly about
    the lack of memory, which is -- unless my syslog is lying to me -- what
    it does right now)

    david parsons \bi/   I'd rather have to have 128mb of vm because I needed
                   \/  it than have 128mb of vm because I need a large buffer
