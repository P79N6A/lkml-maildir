In terms of kernel memory, perhaps. In terms of 'efficiency', I
wouldn't be so sure. Java uses a wack of user space storage to
represent threads regardless of whether they are green or native.  The
only difference is - is Java calling poll()/select()/ioctl()
routinely? Or are the tasks sitting in an efficient kernel task queue?
Which has a better chance of being more efficient, in terms of dispatching,
(especially considering that most of the time, most java threads are idle),
and which has a better chance of being more efficient in terms of the
overhead of querying whether a task is ready to run? I lean towards the OS
on both counts.
