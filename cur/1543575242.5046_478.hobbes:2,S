Hi.
The following patch makes a 'defined but not used' warning go away
when compiling drivers/char/random.c without sysctl support (240t12p3). 
(but should apply cleanly). I am aware that there is a sysctl section 
of this code, but the function seems to belong where it is. I would be
happy to move free_entropy_store to this section if you think this 
is cleaner.
