That's definitely a good thing.

I never heard of anybody reproducing that but accpet() in 2.2
can _definitely_ miss events without the above 00_wake-one-4 patch
because it wrongly considers a progress wakeing up two times the same
exclusive task.
Furthmore the exclusive wakeup logic with the exclusive information
per-task and not per wait_queue_t will screwup if the tasks registers
itself like a wakeall after it was just registered as wakeone somewhere
else (however this second thing is more a theorical issue that shouldn't
trigger in 2.2).
