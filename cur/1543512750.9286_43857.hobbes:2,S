I do not think you can define semantics.
If you think you can, start hacking midnight commander. Any filesystem
known to midnight commander can trivially be made available to kernel
using podfuk. (I bet you have another three references to podfuk.)
I think you are going to find out that cd /#http:www.cs.wisc.edu is
not good idea. I have
/#url:http:||195.113.31.123|~pavel|podfuk|podfuk.html already working,
but it spawns lynx which is ugly.
If you create http client and put it into midnight, it will be good thing.

Not sure. Have you thought about directory semantics?

Ok. Start with downloading sources of midnight commander. Glue it
together with some http downloader. Test that, twice. Then glue it
with podfuk and you've reached your goal.

PS: If you have some troubles, let me know. I _WANT_ http layer for
midnight. If you can do something sane with directories, it will be
superb. In any case, contact me and I'll try to help you.
