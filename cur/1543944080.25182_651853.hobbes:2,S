I think the moving to another CPU gets really dependent on the CPU type. 
On a P4+HT the caches are shared, and moving costs almost nothing for 
cache hits, while on CPUs which have other cache layouts the migration 
cost is higher. Obviously multi-core should be cheaper than 
multi-socket, by avoiding using the system memory bus, but it still can 
get ugly.
I have an IPC test around which showed that, it ran like hell on HT, and 
progressively worse as cache because less shared. I wonder why the 
latest git works so much better?
