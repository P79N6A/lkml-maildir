Yep, adding some printks, it points in that direction:
[  179.898618] DBG string ACTION=add
[  179.908565] put DBG 1 len 22 envlen 68
[  179.919807] DBG string DEVPATH=/class/dmi/id
[  179.921584] DBG req size 836
[  179.921588] DBG ali size 864
[  179.921632] DBG req size 836
[  179.921634] DBG ali size 864
[  179.966998] put DBG 2 len 14 envlen 68
[  179.978208] DBG string SUBSYSTEM=dmi
[  179.988901] put DBG 3 len 21 envlen 68
[  180.000109] DBG string MODALIAS=dSEQNUM=971
as we can see, MODALIAS=d is clearly wrong there and should have a \0.
This is why the skb_put goes over the end of the allocated skb.
[  180.012618] put DBG 4 len 11 envlen 68
[  180.023829] DBG string SEQNUM=971
