Inside the kernel there is one true way and that is readl/writel - you
can get away with direct access if you know that the driver is only
ever going to run on a system with sane PCI mem access. However, this
asumption is not good and readl/writel is strongly recommended (yup I
know some of my code in the current 2.2 tree doesn't but I actually
have updated versions of those drivers ready ;-)
