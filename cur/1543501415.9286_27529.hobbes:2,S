Major update.
Key point is PIIX3 430HX will now support UDMA drives by reprogramming the
chipset and drive to DMA mode 2.  This removes the need of BIOS updates.
Test board is Tyan S1563D SMP Tomcat III 4.01 bios.
There are no more lost interrupts or hiccups durring the reprogramming
point during INIT.
ALI 15x3 has tuneproc added.
UDMA is only stable on M5229 revision C1 or newer.
If you have an older rev. than 193 you are at risk if DMAing failing.
PDC20246/20262 have extra features.
Speed bit forcing and master mode for possible fasttraks.......
Other junk.........it is late..............
This has been accepted for the future 2.3.10 or a variation.
