I'm not sure if I got you wrong, or vice versa. Either way, some
definitions first.
Process Stack == the traditional per-process kernel stack
Interrupt Stack == a dedicated per-CPU stack for interrupts only
CPU Stack == all kernel data on a per-CPU stack
Not for anything would I want a CPU Stack. At first thought, this is
impossible, but in reality it is just ugly beyond anything I could
bear.
An Interrupt Stack is a very good thing. I know PPC machines with 125
Interrupt lines (3 for cascading) that could theoretically all happen
at once. That alone demands for a stack size well above 8k and having
this per process is just a bad design. But that is another issue.
The real Process Stack without the interrupt overhead should not need
to be bigger than 4k. It currently is for all platforms I know about,
s390 has even 16k. This is the point of my regular allyesconfig
compilations and postings.
Do you still disagree? Then I must have misread your mail.
