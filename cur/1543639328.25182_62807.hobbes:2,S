G'day,
I like the basic idea here, and I'm pleased that someone has the courage to
tackle some of the brokenness of the kconfig language (if only because it
will provide me with a precedent when I try to submit some of my patches ;-).
I was a bit worried when I first saw the patch (after all, kconfig is held
together with spit and string) but on careful reading it's mostly doing the
right thing.  Mostly.

You're willing to potentially perturb 2.4?

Good luck, it scares me too.

The last statement is inconsistent with the shell code and the explanations of 
the dep_* statements, which sensibly preserve the current semantics where
an undefined symbol has a distinct fourth value which is not y, m or n.
I'm pleased to see that you have preserved those semantics.  There are many
places in the corpus where a dep_* lists as a dependency a variable which is
not defined until later, or is only defined in some architectures, or is never
defined.  Earlier today I tweaked up gcml2 to detect them and found 260 in
2.5.29.

Perhaps "negates" isn't quite the right word in four-state logic.

Don't you want to check at this point that arg starts with CONFIG_?
Also, how about quoting \$$arg  ?

When CONFIG_FOO is undefined, !CONFIG_FOO and CONFIG_FOO are both ignored,
which is not consistent with the mention of "!" in the explanations for the
dep_* statements.  Perhaps you need to more carefully define the semantics
of the ! prefix.
