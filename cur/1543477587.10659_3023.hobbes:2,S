Hello *,
Some notes about configuration weirdness in 2.2.0-pre4 (I have not had time
to grab a more recent version to test):
Configure.help says:
	CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN
	  The vast majority of SCSI devices have only one LUN, and
	  so most people can say N here and should in fact do so, because it
	  is safer.
but it defaults to Y in the distributed tarball.
If you disable modules, then select to build something as a module,
it does not give you an error - it responds as if you typed "?".
The message at the bottom:
	and do a 'make dep ; make clean' if you want to be sure all the
	files are correctly re-made
should probably say:
	and do a 'make dep && make clean'
in case dependency errors get scrolled off the screen by
the 'make clean'.
I got an error compiling the serial port support.  I do not know
if this is an error in the code or the configuration.  It
appears that 'rs_interrupt' can be defined three different ways,
but with the attached .config (which was generated from make config),
it does not get defined at all!
My setup:
	486, 16MB RAM, SCSI + IDE disks, the following system tools:
	$ gcc --version ; ld -v ; ls -l /lib/libc.so.5 ; ldd -v ; expr --version
	2.7.2.3
	GNU ld version 2.9.1 (with BFD 2.9.1.0.15)
	lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           14 Jan 10 23:41 /lib/libc.so.5 -> libc.so.5.4.46
	ldd: version 1.9.9
	expr (GNU sh-utils) 1.16
The error messages:
	gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-kernels/linux-2.2.0-pre4/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -pipe -fno-str
	ength-reduce -m486 -DCPU=486   -c -o serial.o serial.c
	serial.c: In function `set_multiport_struct':
	serial.c:2016: `rs_interrupt' undeclared (first use this function)
	serial.c:2016: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
	serial.c:2016: for each function it appears in.)
	serial.c:1957: warning: `handler' might be used uninitialized in this function
	make[3]: *** [serial.o] Error 1
	make[3]: Leaving directory `/usr/src/linux-kernels/linux-2.2.0-pre4/drivers/char'
	make[2]: *** [first_rule] Error 1
