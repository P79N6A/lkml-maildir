Why does it freeze then with this config? I doubt it has ultimately to do with
the 4-port card being of "4-port nature". I can use every of its ports that
does not share interrupt with another device. As soon as I share I get busted.
As I told the driver used for ethernet doesn't seem to matter as tulip and
sundance show the same effect.
I am very interested in solving this somehow having five pieces of these
boards...
What can I do? Is there any documentation needed from SIS, or anything else?
