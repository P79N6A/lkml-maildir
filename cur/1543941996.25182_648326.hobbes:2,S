The thing is, that's often an advantage. Not just for performance.

.. and all this could equally well be done by a simple bridging protocol 
(completely independently of any AoE code).
The thing is, iSCSI does things at the wrong level. It *forces* people to 
use the complex protocols, when it's a known that a lot of people don't 
want it. 
Which is why these AoE and FCoE things keep popping up. 
It's easy to bridge ethernet and add a new layer on top of AoE if you need 
it. In comparison, it's *impossible* to remove an unnecessary layer from 
iSCSI.
This is why "simple and low-level is good". It's always possible to build 
on top of low-level protocols, while it's generally never possible to 
simplify overly complex ones.
