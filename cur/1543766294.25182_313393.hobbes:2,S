No, quite the reverse. If I merge from you, and you use my commit ID as 
the "base" point, it will work again.
But yes, if you actually send the result as _patches_ to me, then the 
commit objects I create will be totally separate from the commit objects 
you had in your tree, and "git-export" will continue to export your old 
stale entries since they won't show up as already being in my tree.
The point being, that there is a big difference between a proper merge 
(with history etc merged) and just sending me the patches in your tree.
