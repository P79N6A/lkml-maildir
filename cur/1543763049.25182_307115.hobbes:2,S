As I've said, in the past the Intel RNGs in particular -have- failed, 
but the rest of the system keeps on working just fine.
It probably depends on the hardware implementation; I think the Intel 
RNG was based on a thermal diode, or somesuch.
In the cases where an RNG has failed in the past, the system has worked 
as expected:  rngd stopped feeding data into the entropy pool.
If the VIA RNG (on-CPU) fails, that's probably indicative of a larger 
problem, though.
