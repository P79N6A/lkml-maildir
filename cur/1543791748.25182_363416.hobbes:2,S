 Oh, absolutely -- the timer interrupt line of the nForce2 chipset is
known to suffer from glitches under certain circumstances.  As APIC inputs
are truly edge-triggered, if thus configured, unlike ones of 8259A chips
which ignore such interrupts if not handled before deassertion, all
glitches are actually handled as real interrupts leading to a significant
time drift.  I've thought nVidia had a workaround for that -- cc-ing their
contact; not sure if still active.  I've had a brief look at my archives
and the suggestion was to disable the "Spread Spectrum" option if
available in the firmware setup (not sure what to do if there is none).
