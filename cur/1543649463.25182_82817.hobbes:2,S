Ah, ok. I see what you mean - for a moment i thought IrDA was doing
something clever with netlink.

I think the only time you should go netdev is when it makes sense to run
IP. Is there IP over bluttooth? Then you could take advantage of all the
nice features provided by netdevices (other than being IP devices;->).
If not, it probably time for someone to write a generic notification
scheme via netlink.
