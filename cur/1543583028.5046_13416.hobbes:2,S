For a local tx/rx.  (open question) What happens with
a router box with netfilter and queueing?  Perhaps
this type of optimisation will help more in that case?
think about a box with 4 1G NICs being able to
route AND do QoS per conntrack connection
(ala RSVP and such)
Really what I'm looking for is something like SGI's
STP (Scheduled Transfer Protocol).  mmap your
tcp recieve buffer, and have a card smart enough
to figure out header alignment, (i.e. know header
size based on protocol number) transfer only that,
let the kernel process it, then tell the card to DMA
the data from the buffer right into process memory.
(or other NIC)
Make it possible to have the performance of a
Juniper network processor + flexiblity of Linux.
