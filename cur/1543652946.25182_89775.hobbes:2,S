	I personally have stayed at 2.5.46 because I depend on modules
and will wait until the situation "settle down". So, don't expect quick
resolution from my side.
	I'm a bit puzzled by this error. Nothing has changed between
2.5.46 and 2.5.47. The symbol wireless_send_event() is still properly
exported in .../net/netsyms.c, and all uses of it are protected in #if
WIRELESS_EXT statements.
	Questions :
	1) Do you have module versioning enabled ? (Called "Set
version information on all module symbols").
	2) Did you change the config midway through the compile,
i.e. does a "make clean" of the kernel make it go away ?
	But as I say, I'm mostly stabbing in the dark...
	Good luck...
	Jean
