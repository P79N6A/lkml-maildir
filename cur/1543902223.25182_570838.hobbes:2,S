I don't buy that performance argument, in this case.  You are already 
dirtying the same cacheline with other variable initializations.
Like I noted in the changeset description (hey, this is precisely why I 
included it, so that we could have this discussion), IMO the flow of 
control makes it not only impossible for the compiler to understand the 
full value range of 'f0', but also difficult for humans as well.
I could perhaps understand initializing the variable to some poison 
value rather than zero, but IMO the code is stronger with f0 set to a 
sane value.
It's poorly readable, poorly commented code as-is.
