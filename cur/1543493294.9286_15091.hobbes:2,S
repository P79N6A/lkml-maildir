Hi all,
Since 2.2.? I have been having a lot of problem using the sync command.
It "hang" my system and sometimes just the window from which I'm running
the command "sync".
It is very consistant (works fine 1 out of 4).
The major difference is that I rencently installed vmware which runs
with nice -19
But I don't see how could that affect the sync command except for the
fac that it is very "io consuming".
Here are some information that can be usefull;
