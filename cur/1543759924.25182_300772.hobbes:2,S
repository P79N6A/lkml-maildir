We have seen lots of ESTALE's/ENOENT's when the server is running 2.6.10 
(vanilla). Don't know if this was supposed to be fixed in the 2.6.10-FC 
kernels, but vanilla 2.6.11 doesen't seem to have this bug at all.
You mention a lot of kernel versions including 2.6.11, and I can't really 
figure out whether you are talking abount the clients or the server. - 
Anyways if your server has only run with 2.6.10 - try 2.6.11.
- Apologies if I missed something obvious.
