I just got the "Das Keyboard" USB keyboard, and I've found  a message filling 
up my logs:
drivers/usb/input/hid-core.c: input irq status -71 received
lsusb reports the keyboard as:
Bus 002 Device 002: ID 03f9:0100 KeyTronic Corp.
I've searched the list and seen some previous posts with similar errors, but 
no definitive answer, does anyone know how to fix this? Thanks!
