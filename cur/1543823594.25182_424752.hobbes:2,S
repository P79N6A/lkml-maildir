I tested a Targus PA095 with 2.6.12, 2.6.14 and 2.6.17-rc4 with the same
results.
Problem: The ethernet (driven by pegasus) does not work and spews error
messages.
The message:
May 17 08:01:43 potato kernel: [1384852.200880] pegasus 1-1.3.5:1.0: ctrl_callback, status -71
<repeats over 700 times in 1 second>
This did work with 2.6.10.  I do not know about 2.6.11.
Tested on 2 entirely different machines with the same result.
I also attempted to use the 2.6.10 pegasus.[ch] in 2.6.14 with the same
result.
