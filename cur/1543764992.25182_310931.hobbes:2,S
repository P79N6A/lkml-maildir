Hi Alan,

Bingo. I seem to have found what looks like it in:
linux-2.4.21-selected-ac-bits.patch
linux-2.4.21-tunable-overcommit.patch
But many of the other patches messes with mmap.c, as well :-), so I 
guess there is some tracking assignment ahead...
But nevertheless, thanks for pointing me to the source...
BR,
  Martin Egholm
