Thats too slow if you're right before a police bust. I know some guys
who ran one of 'those' BBSes in the good old days before the web and
he had all of his disks (the big ones: 60 MB) in his bathtub layered
with thermite.
If the police busts him, then he just wanted to ignite the tub and
data begone...
... no, as far as I know, he never had really to do it. You would have
read of this on the net... ;-)
	Kind regards
