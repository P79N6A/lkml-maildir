If you just want to generate packets then try pktgen in Linux-2.4.19:
CONFIG_NET_PKTGEN
  This module will inject preconfigured packets, at a configurable
  rate, out of a given interface.  It is used for network interface
  stress testing and performance analysis.  If you don't understand
  what was just said, you don't need it: say N.
  Documentation on how to use the packet generator can be found
  at <file:Documentation/networking/pktgen.txt>.
  This code is also available as a module called pktgen.o ( = code
  which can be inserted in and removed from the running kernel
  whenever you want).  If you want to compile it as a module, say M
  here and read <file:Documentation/modules.txt>.
