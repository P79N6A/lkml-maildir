Hi!
I am running the Linux 2.0.36-07 kernel and have some problems when tunnelling traffic. I have loaded the two modules ipip.o and new_tunnel.o. To set up a test tunnel I have given the commands
#ifconfig tunl0 172.16.1.5 up
#route add -host 172.16.1.1 dev eth0
#route add -net 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 172.16.1.1 tunl0
This should result in all traffic sent to the 192.168.1.0/24 network is encapsulated within an ip-packet, in which the src-ip is 172.16.1.5 and dst-ip is 172.16.1.1. My problem is that this dst-ip is not properly set. When pinging machine 192.168.1.10 the src-ip is correctly set to 172.16.1.5 but the dst-ip is still 192.168.1.10, it should be 172.16.1.1. I used the tcpdump program to see the traffic.
Anybody know what is wrong?
Best wishes,
Olle Lindroos
