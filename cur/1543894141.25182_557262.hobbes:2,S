No it only applies if CONFIG_CISS_SCSI_TAPE is defined (which is different than
only being applicable to scsi tape devices.  I'm not sure why the cciss driver
ifdefs the relevant code to only support TAPE devices, but I figured that wasn't
as relevant to this problem.  Sufice it to say, that all scsi commands to all
cciss devices pass through this code if CONFIG_CISS_SCSI_TAPE is defined, and if
its not defined, add_sendcmd_reject always returns 0
Thanks & Regards
