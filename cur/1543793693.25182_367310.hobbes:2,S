Be careful not to assume that some set of requirements on our result
is an appropriate set because, for each requirement, someone else has
demonstrated a solution that meets that requirement.
Sometimes there are tradeoffs.  For example, ckpt will checkpoint/restart
a single task without kernel support, but doesn't preserve (from its README
at 
http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~zandy/ckpt/README
):
- File descriptors of open files, special devices,
  pipes, and sockets;
- Interprocess communication state (such as shared memory, semaphores,
  mutex, messages);
- Kernel-level thread state;
- Process identifiers, including process id, process group;
  id, user id, or group id.
and doesn't work with static bound programs (uses PRELOAD).
