That still doesn't handle the case where a device has an interrupt
handler on a shared IRQ and another device on the chain interrupts it
after it has suspended its device,
we need to either fix *for all drivers* (otherwise people sharing IRQs
will have breakages that people not sharing them won't see ... )
a) add request/free irq sets
b) add code to the interrupt handlers to make sure we aren't in a
powerdown state...
I don't really mind which is the recommended one I'd just prefer we do
it the same way everwhere... so I still believe the yenta_irq patch is
correct if we are doing a, or if not we need to do b....
Dave.
