Hi!
> BUilding with sparse shows lots of warnings.
You seem to be the lucky one, able to actually compile the
beast. Could you run diff against vanilla and post it somewhere?
"Normal" installation procedure has too many steps in my eyes, and
combined git tree is not available, so I was waiting for merge at
least into -wirelessdev tree.
