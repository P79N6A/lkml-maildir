Nicholas,
Could you stop spamming linux-kernel and linux-scsi mailing lists by 
patches for your out-of-tree LIO project, please?
Those mailing lists are intended for patches for in-kernel components 
only, not for all out-of-tree projects, finding their ways into the 
mainline. I don't see any reason why your project should be an 
exception. Think, what a mess the kernel mailing lists would get, if all 
out-of-tree projects started sending their patches to them?
My personal practical concerns about your patches that they trigger my 
e-mail filters, so I have to spend on them much more time than I would want.
So, please, respect other people and stop sending your LIO patches.
Thanks,
Vlad
