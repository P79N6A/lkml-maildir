they do. eg. tcp timer and state data is very useful information,
see other msg for an example why. no, going through netstat is not
a solution. (esp considering that currently this wouldn't solve
the problem anyway)

FWIW I don't like the overhead that a higher HZ gives, but would
like to have them for other reasons (realtime, interactive stuff),
so the next step would be to have a variable, adaptive HZ. That
means that timer values will no longer have a granularity of one. 
(yes, it may not be trivial, there are time/timers/scheduling
 related issues)
