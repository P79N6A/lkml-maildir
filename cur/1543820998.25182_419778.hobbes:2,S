The same could be said about selinux. Or what are you doing
to e.g. stop DOS attacks? Nothing is 100% water tight. The question
is just if the subsets of controls it implements matches the requirements of 
the administrator. These requirements both include easiness of use
and security. Usually there is a tradeoff there and it's not the
same for everybody.

I guess he doesn't want to administrate a "cluster" of machines with many
/s, just a single box.
