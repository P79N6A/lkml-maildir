Subject: [2.6.16-rc6 patch] remove sleep_avg multiplier
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Greetings,
The patchlet below removes the sleep_avg multiplier.  This multiplier
was necessary back when we had 10 seconds of dynamic range in sleep_avg,
but now that we only have one second, it causes that one second to be
compressed down to 100ms in some cases.  This is particularly noticeable
when compiling a kernel in a slow NFS mount, and I believe it to be a
very likely candidate for other recently reported network related
interactivity problems.
In testing, I can detect no negative impact of this removal.  IMHO, this
constitutes a bug-fix, and as such is suitable for 2.6.16.
