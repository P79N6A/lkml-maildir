I don't know what exactly the i915_suspend() and i915_resume() are 
supposed to do because it works better without them.
After inserting "return 0;" right at the top of those two functions, 
suspend (and power-off properly), and resume (without green screen) works 
just fine.
I would like to know what they're for.
Tested suspend-to-ram, and suspend-to-disk, both console and X on notebook 
internal LCD display, all works without these two functions.
But, anyway, got down to just one line in i915_drv.c causing the hang 
during suspend. "pci_set_power_state(dev->pdev, PCI_D3hot);".
And green screen problem during resume is caused by i915_restore_vga(dev);
So, let me where to go from here.
Thanks,
Jeff.
