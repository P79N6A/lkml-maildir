Well, you can also lose the kernel. We used to catch it with MOL
(since MOL increase the amount of DEC interrupts when running
within the virtual machine) quite easily.
Fortunately, the MOL kernel engine would then figure out that
something was wrong, bail out killing the emulator properly and
give useful error messages. So at that time, we could find the
problem before it beeing documented.
