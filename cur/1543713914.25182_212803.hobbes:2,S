It's not fixable via the i_shared_sem, but we can add another layer
of spin_lock around the i_mmap* list/tree manipulations, one that
preprocesses away to nothing on all arches but parisc and arm, and
is used in their __flush_dcache_page.  *Not* the page_table_lock ;)
Unappealing, but a lot better than leaving them unsafe.
