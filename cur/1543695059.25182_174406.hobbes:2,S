That's not secure; four bytes give only 2^32 = 4 billion odd
possibilities. An enemy can easily enumerate them all as the
start of an attack.

Neat utility, and one I didn't know about. Thanks.

I think we'd all like to see it improved if possible. The question
is how, and why?
>(better entropy estimation, better entropy management,
I see no problems there.
The estimation is of course imperfect, but seems conservative
and reasonable.
There are only two ways I can see to manage entropy -- use a pool
as /dev/random does or just use a couple of hash contexts as
Yarrow does. Methinks the pool approach is better because it
gives a higher upper bound on entropy used. The implementation
in /dev/random looks fine to me, too.
Do you have anything specific? What do you think is wrong in
these areas, and can you suggest a fix?

Once you have a file system, that's easy. Just cat or dd a
saved entropy file into /dev/random. You can play with pool
size #defines in the /dev/random code and constants in the
shellscript to adjust the details.
Do you think you need this before there's a file system? Why?
Or are you thinking of boxes that don't have a file system?
Or not writable? Not local?

I suspect that's the real issue. People report using other
things because /dev/urandom is too slow.
Can we speed up /dev/urandom? Or perhaps write a PRNG daemon?
If all we need is a library, there's an RC4-based one named
prng.c in the FreeS/WAN libraries.

I'm with you there.
