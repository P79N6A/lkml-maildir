I have to say that I experienced a similar problem while playing squake 
(SVGALib). The game also froze without any warning and the sound was the
only thing that remained working.
I have SoundBlaster support built in the kernel, with low level SB AWE synth
added.
Absolutely nothing was recorded in either syslog and kern.log, and the SysRQ
key failed to work.
Another weird thing I noticed is that the kernel saw that my card was an AWE
card only when I previously loaded the _DOS_ drivers for the card. In other
cases it saw the card as a SoundBlaster, but it failed to load the AWE synth.
I hope this adds more detail to the problem.
