It only sounds strange at first. It actually means that scanf is
consistent with C's rules of assignment between mixed types. For
example:
ray:~$ cat signs.c
#include <stdio.h>
main() {
	char scan[]="-100";
	unsigned int u;
	int i;
	sscanf(scan, "%ud", &u);
	sscanf(scan, "%d", &i);
	printf("%s scanned to signed %d and unsigned %u\n", scan, i, u);
	i=-100;
	u=i;
	printf("%d assigned to unsigned int gives %u\n", i, u);
}
ray:~$ ./signs
-100 scanned to signed -100 and unsigned 4294967196
-100 assigned to unsigned int gives 4294967196
So, one should think of scanf as having correct knowledge of the types
it's scanning, and then shoe-horning the result into whatever you asked
for. Just like C itself.
