Well, that's partly nonsense.  The only error condition which is always being
checked in correctly written software is EINTR - if you've got an interrupt,
continue/retry the I/O.
Checking and retrying for EAGAIN is umm.. plain wrong.  You'll get a nice
busywait eating 100% CPU this way, till the I/O actually happens, and will
get another the next try.
Checking I/Os for every possible weird condition is just non-productive.
It's like this:
  if (fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, ~O_NONBLOCK) < 0)  error_out();
  if (fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0) & O_NOBLOCK) ??? what to do?
  while(do_something())
    if (fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0) & O_NOBLOCK)
      if (fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, ~O_NONBLOCK) < 0)  error_out();
(don't pay attention to ~O_NONBLOCK thing - it's wrong, but it's
used like that just to show the "idea" - which is to clear O_NONBLOCK)
Which is a complete nonsense.  It's either set or cleared, and once
set or cleared it should stay that way, period.  Until the app changes
it again.

With dup() - maybe.  But definitely NOT with fork().

Retrying I/O in case of EAGAIN is *wrong*.  See above.
But sure, in case of dup() an app should be prepared to set up all the flags
properly.
