That really makes all the existing code not work with it. Doing an altmm
is easy in the sense that it doesn't require 20 new syscall and doesnt
slow down the main kernel paths for a single odd case.
I can see why there is a need to manipulate the other mm I need to think
about the right way to handle it.
