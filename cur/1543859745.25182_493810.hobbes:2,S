Arjan,
The driver implements all the ethtool operations that apply to it.
The GETREG ioctl is left for debug purposes:
get_regs doesn't return clear-on-read registers while GETREG does.
Using request_firmware assumes that the driver knows the FW file name
and the driver initiates the load. That's not our model where we work
with different FWs, don't know what the names are, and the user 
initiates the load.
Cheers,
Divy
