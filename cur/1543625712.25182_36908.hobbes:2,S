My ASUS P4T-E is supposed to have an IO-APIC in its 850 chipset,
and the BIOS setup does allow me to specify apic delivery mode,
but I've never been able to get the kernel (SMP or UP_IOAPIC)
to detect the IO-APIC.
My guess is that Linux only finds the IO-APIC if it's listed in
the MP-table. Perhaps newer boxes publish the info via ACPI?
