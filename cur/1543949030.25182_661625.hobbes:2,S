yeah - the minute i added the patch i pinged Roland about that offline.

currently the reality is that i have to fix over 90% of the commit 
messages that go towards you :-/
While i'd like that proportion to be a lot lower, it's really hard for 
people to write good commit messages for fixes: people tend to send 
their fixes the minute they find the problem (being happy about having 
found and fixed a problem!), so the commit message gets little 
attention.
another effect is that kernel generalist people like Roland have a very 
large list of todo items so when they write up the commit message they 
might be thinking about the next unsolved problem already - and the 
commit message becomes a quick, unstructured and semi-automatic 
brain-dump of all details in essence :-/
Also, who am i to complain about the commit message - i'm often the one 
who has put the bug in to begin with! [ So i'm perfectly happy with you 
volunteering to take over that role ;-) ]
But yes, it's easier for me too to sort and prioritize patches if their 
description has good structure, so i regularly try to remind high-volume 
patch submitters about that. ( With little success i have to say - 
commit messages seem to be suffering from the same curse of inattention 
as other types of documentation do :-/ )
