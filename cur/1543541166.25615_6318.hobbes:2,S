    Ugh, I admit I haven't actually checked it even though I should have to. 
   But this poses a problem in serial.c (and possibly other serial drivers,
   too) -- it needs to check if SysRq is enabled even before calling
   handle_sysrq().  Otherwise the character immediately preceding the BREAK
   condition gets lost for no reason.  When handle_sysrq() gets finally
   called, it's already too late -- the chacter have already been lost.
No, only the break character, and possibly the character following that
may get lost.   And this only happens if you've configured a serial
console.  (a) BREAK doesn't happen all that often on serial lines to
begin with, these days, and (b) it's very unlikely to happen on the
serial console.
This doesn't necessarily mean that we shouldn't fix this, but let's keep
things in perspective......  This is not what I would call
earth-shatterring.  :-)
