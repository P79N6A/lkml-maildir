Yes, this works fine for UDP, but you can't do TCP this way without COW VM 
support for scatter skbufs, because TCP needs to buffer data until it has been
acknowledged.  Even then, you need the application to behave properly and not 
touch anything in the same page as the output data until an ACK is received.  
This is easy enough to hack into high bandwidth servers, like ftp or rcp, and 
that is mostly the only place you will need it.
