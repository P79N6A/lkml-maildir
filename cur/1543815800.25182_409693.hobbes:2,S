hm, it's somewhat unusual for MAX_FOO to be inclusive.  Usually it means
"greatest possible+1".
you have
	struct channel_subsystem {
	 	struct channel_path *chps[__MAX_CHPID + 1];
so I guess it all works..

This has two callsites.  inlining it probably deoptimises things.

gcc tends to generate poor code for this construct.
