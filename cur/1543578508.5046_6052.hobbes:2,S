Oh, certainly. We need COW for completely unrelated reasons - suppose
you open() a file and then change your *ID. You definitely want credentials
on the opened file to stay unchanged.
Pthreads are non-issue as far as I'm concerned. I'ld rather avoid mixing
them with credentials' cache. BTW, what about *BSD implementations? Do
they change creds of all threads upon set*id(2)?
