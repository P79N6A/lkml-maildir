No, Fuse is not a broken idea in the first place. It's the freezer that
is a totally broken idea. It has proven many times to be racy by design
and cannot be made right. Ther usermode helper mess is just part of
that, fuse is another example, etc etc ...
So I think Matthew is totally right. In fact, the presence of the
freezer is the main reason why Paulus so far NACKed Johannes attempts at
merging the PPC PM code with the generic code in kernel/power.c
We've been doing fine without it so far and intend to continue to do so.
As for suspend-to-disk, I refer you to the discussions we had in the
past with Linus, where he explains I think quite clearly how wrong the
current implementation of STR is :-)
Thing is, if you're going to do snapshots, you should probably not sync
after you have "frozen" anyway.
Cheers,
Ben.
