The computer is happily running after reboot... it could have been

I had following modules loaded when it happened:
sb                     34484   0
uart401                 6128   0  [sb]
sound                  58188   0  [sb uart401]
soundcore               2564   6  (autoclean) [sb sound]
vmnet                   9384   1
vmmon                   9896   0  (unused)
maybe ncpfs and smbfs, too...
What determines if I have symbols for a module or not?
