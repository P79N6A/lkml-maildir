Sorry, to be honest, I've not understood you there at all.
I wonder if you're seeing some other use than I intended.

How right you are!  Thank you.  Does the further patch below suit?

Doesn't that rather depend on what the dtor does?  I'm not used to how
destructors are commonly used, but I can easily imagine a destructor
which, say, frees up some attached objects, but still leaves this cache
object recognizably itself, good enough for the reference-after-free
which SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU is allowing - all we need to avoid is the
page being freed (or poisoned or unmapped) and reused.  I don't see a
need to prohibit or delay dtor necessarily - but there's no question,
those who make use of this SLAB_DESTROY_BY_RCU technique do still
need to take great care when referencing after free.
