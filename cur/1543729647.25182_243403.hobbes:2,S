FWIW, I had to use smake, latest version from his site, in order to 
compile 2.01a37 just yesterday.  The error messages from make (very 
carefully programmed into the Makefile) indicated that the lost 
headers it couldn't find were a bug in make-3.80, and that his make 
suffered from no such errors.  It didn't.
Since the gnu make has only had, what, 2, maybe 3 revisions in almost 
a decade, maybe, just maybe, there is a grain of truth to Jorg's 
objections and often childish squawking, at least over the gnu make 
which he has mentioned, among others.

cdrecord: Warning: Running on Linux-2.6.8-rc4
cdrecord: There are unsettled issues with Linux-2.5 and newer.
cdrecord: If you have unexpected problems, please try Linux-2.4 or 
Solaris.
However Jorg, since I built from your tarball, and used smake to do 
it, why is it now proclaiming to be a "Clone".
That doesn't seem to be the intended action unless he is carrying the 
linux/solaris battles in his code with conditionals.  And thats 
childish.
