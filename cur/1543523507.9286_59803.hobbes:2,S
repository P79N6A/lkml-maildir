Alan,
     Some time ago there had been a thread about NFS corruption with Linux
clients (kernel 2.2.12) and AIX 4.3 servers.  AIX support have had an efix
for some time, but now the final fix is packaged and ready.  In case there
are still people seeing the problem (an "off by one" problem seeking in
files), here are the details.
     The APAR numbers (problem identifiers) are IY06322 and IY07236.  The
PTF number (fix identifier) is U467112.  This corresponds to the LPP
box.net.nfs.client 4.3.3.10.  Anyone can download the patch from
http://techsupport.services.ibm.com/rs6k/fixdb.html
     Cheers,
