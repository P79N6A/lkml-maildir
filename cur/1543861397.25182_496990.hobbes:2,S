The problem is that I have no sufficient FS knowledge to argument why
it helps here. It was a desperate attempt to fix the problem for us
and it definitely worked well.
Hmmm I'm thinking about something very dirty : would it be possible
to reduce the current FS size to get more space to create another
FS ? Supposing you create a XX GB/TB XFS after the current ext3,
you would be able to mount it in some directories with --bind and
slowly switch some parts to it. The problem with this approach is
that it will never be 100% converted, but as an experiment it might
be worth it, no ?
