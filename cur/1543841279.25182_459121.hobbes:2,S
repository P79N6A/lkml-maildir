OK, generic multi-platform code, blinking keyboard leds, etc...
I don't get your point, what are you trying to demonstrate ?
If you want to explain your reject of the HLT instruction just
because other places in the kernel don't use it, that's rather
counter-evolutive and another approach might be to ask if it
would not be appropriate to add a few others at some places.
But you justified your removal of this instruction by your fear
of a potential problem caused by a but pointed out by some poorly
commented field in one struct, and left open a small window for a
change in case someone else confirmed it. We took time to explain
why this bug was even in our advantage. If you really didn't want
the HLT in the first place for your own reasons, we would have all
saved some time by neither searching info on it nor talking about
it.
I don't really mind whether the CPU really halts or not, it's just
that I find it stupid to make it spin for nothing when we know we
can avoid it. That's all.

Willy
