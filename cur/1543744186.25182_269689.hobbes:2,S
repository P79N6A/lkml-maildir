Naturally it is; it's even fairly common if you're using a very old
compiler or a very old glibc (although support for libc5 is gone as of
GCC-3.4.)

That's unlikely.
I just doubt that a bug in string concatenation could be chalked up to
glibc, is all.

They're of course free to do that, if they don't mind not getting access
to new stuff in the new releases; at least if they're working in C
(anyone compiling C++ code with GCC<3.x is a little strange, in my
opinion).
