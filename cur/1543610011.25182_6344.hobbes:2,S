Hi,
I want to mmap a device in an application, so I do: 
	base = mmap(NULL ,  DEV_LENGTH,  myprot , flags, kmem, dev_base); 
Turns out that some BIOSs put my device at an address like
	0xdffffc00
whereas others put it at 0xfa000000 . In the latter case, mmap works
as expected. However in the first case I get EINVAL: The base is
not page-aligned. 
However, in the latter case I get my requested 1k of memory, and the
following 3k for free. In the first case I'd want "3k for free,
followed by the 1k I requested".
effectively, provided "start" equals NULL, the kernel IMHO should:
	offset = dev_base & PAGE_MASK; 
	return mmap (NULL, length+offset, prot, flags, base - offset) + offset; 
Comments?
The "failure" was observed on 2.4.14 and/or 2.4.9. 
		Roger. 
P.S. I end up not being able to closely follow linux-kernel
lately. CCs to me appreciated.
