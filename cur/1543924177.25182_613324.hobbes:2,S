Figures... the "dailies" and "weeklies" for tar files of tcpdump and libpcap 
source are fubar... again.  I've email in to tcpdump-workers on that one.  If 
that isn't resolved quickly I'll learn how to access their CVS (pick an SCM, any 
SCM...)
I did an apt-get of debian lenny's tcpdump and sources:
hpcpc103:~# tcpdump -V
tcpdump version 3.9.8
libpcap version 0.9.8
and that seems to show the false checksum failure and not use the 
TP_STATUS_CSUMNOTREADY - at least that didn't appear in a grepping of the 
sources.  At first I thought it might be, but then I realized that my snaplen 
was too short to get the whole TSO'ed frame so tcpdump wasn't even trying to 
verify.  After disabling TSO on the NIC, leaving CKO on, and making my snaplen > 
1500 I could see it was doing undesirable stuff.
I'll see what top of trunk has at some point and what the folks there think of 
adding-in a change.
