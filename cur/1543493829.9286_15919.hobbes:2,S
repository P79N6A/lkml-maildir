I don't see how fM could help any. Again I kind of like the fR idea.
For fM could you please carefully consider some of the arguements that
have come to light. You mentioned compatibility so please focus on how it
might be used to relieve the problem with "pure draft" leaving 'cp' and
family either unusable for admining or security holes.

For now just let suid-root have it normal compatible behavior-- complement

setuid0 marking tar,cp,rpm, etc is broken anyway you look at it.
for "pure draft" you to admit that they are unusable for admin purposes,
that is really hard on rpm since it's install thing is a major
commonly used admin function of rpm. May I suggest you take a closer look
at "soiled" caps which neatly avoids having to privledged mark those
files. You may optional in addition use elf headers which can only
further restrict.

Wait for ext3.

Warning:
When I mention capabilites I mean "soiled" capabilities not "pure draft".
Any caps I mention are *derived* from a withdrawn draft posix document.
