The F00F bug-fix has no affect on performance. The only way it
will affect performance is if you have defined a special handler for
illegal opcodes and insist upon putting them into your executable code.
The bug-fix works by making (marking) the illegal-opcode interrupt
descriptor "not-present". Therefore, if you execute an illegal op-code,
the descriptor has to be paged in. This allows the page-fault handler
to inspect the code. This paging only occurs when an undefined op-code
exists in the instruction stream.
Note that 32-bit mode uses interrupt/trap gates, defined by descriptors.
These descriptors can exist anywhere in physical RAM. They don't have to
be "in order" like an interrupt table. Therefore, the descriptor for
the illegal-opcode trap descriptor (only) is put in a page that is
marked not-present.
This does waste the rest of the page (RAM), however it does not affect
performance.
