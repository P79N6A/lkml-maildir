So your sole basis for disliking 2.95 is that the *compiler* is slower??
Not the code it generates, not the error messages it spits out or the
strictness (or lack there of) of type inforcement??  Just the speed??
Hmm... well, I guess everyone's gotta have something to hate...
All right, then just what *is* a good version to use?  No, better yet,
what is a good version to use when porting to a new processor (actually
an old processor)?  I've pulled the source to gcc (2.95.2) and binutils
(2.10) in prep for a port to a new/old machine.  If these versions aren't
good to start from, what versions are and where can I find them?
