The crapiest 33MHz, 32-bit PCI/Bus in lowly '486 machines hanging
around the lab will beat the Celistia hands-down.

Really?  Well somebody from Salem New Hampshire wrote email to
one of my zillions of managers claiming that this was the "fix".
I was forced to make this "fix" and it "fixed" it. Further,
every "^!&@*$%^!_*(@" so called software, hardware, and whatever
"Engineer......" If that's the correct word, required (demanded)
to see the source code because they were "sure" that " had screwed
up.
To date, there has been no such finding of screw-ups on my part.
FYI, it's really difficult to screw up a "(@#%^P_*!@&#" DMA!
Other machines are able to DMA at over 130 megabytes/second. The
boxes in question run at only 50 megabytes/second.

Not so.

I published a "fix" for the abysimal PCI performance on that
piece of crap. If you don't like it then so what. Fix the
damn box.

I don't give a damn.  The box has no DMA capability as it is.
One might as well just use a wet string top communicate with
the PCI boards. The "fix" forced upon me by you guys is now
somehow incorrect?
Go to hell.
