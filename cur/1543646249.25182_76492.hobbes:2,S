Your list_member macro:
+static inline int list_member(struct list_head *member)
+{
+ return ((!member->next || !member->prev) ? 0 : 1);
+}
seems wrong to me.  A list head which has been removed from its list using
list_del() still points to its old prev & next entries.  If removed using
list_del_init(), those pointers are reinitialised to point at itself.
ie you only need list_empty().  Are you abusing list.h somehow?
