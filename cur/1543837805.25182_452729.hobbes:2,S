If you _allocate_ memory at startup you're doing something wrong.  All
you should do is allocate address space.  Memory should be allocated
when it is needed.
Growing a memory region is always hard because it means you cannot keep
any addresses around and always have to reload a base pointer.  That's
not ideal.
Especially on 64-bit machines address space really is no limitation
anymore.  So, allocate as much as needed, allocate memory when it's
needed, and don't resize.
