Th eone system I had myself was a Sony PCG-CR1. I don't have any pointers
to the discussion, it was in the late 2.3.x tree if I remember correctly.

Unlikely. The IO-APIC on x86 is in that region, but it doesn't respond
from external sources, it's not actually on the PCI bus and only visible
from the CPU. And the CPU decodes that address internally and sends it on
the APIC bus and thus PCI devices simply do not matter for it.

There's no point in you arguing about this. The problem exists and is real
on x86. The patch posted IS NOT GOING IN. That's final, and there's just
no point to arguing about it.
Alternative methods anyone?
