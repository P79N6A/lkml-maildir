Well, the sad part is that doing another list_del() won't even necessarily 
go *boom*. Most of the time it might even leave the list as-is, but often 
enough it should give list corruption.

Absolutely. It does look like a rather nasty bug.
It doesn't explain what Gene sees, though, unless you can explain how we'd 
get an anon dentry without knfsd/xfs. Oh well.
I'll commit the obvious one-liner fix, since it might explain _some_ 
problems people have seen.
