IA64 booting is completely different. I don't think it should 
be in this patch. At least you would need to check with the IA64
maintainer first.
And the other thing is that this will cost memory. Either make
it dependend on !CONFIG_SMALL or fix the boot code to save the 
command line into a kmalloc'ed buffer of the right size and __init 
the original one
