There are big bootstrapping issues with any device which may hold the
root filesystem, so I doubt if it would be a good idea for SCSI.
As for dynamically pluggable devices, I guess the correct way to
handle these is via a daemon which invokes the script when new devices
are added or removed. That way we only have inodes for devices that
are actually present, not for ones which might turn up later.
Cheers,
Matt
