Thanks Randy,  I'll make sure those get put in our
corrections list.  We're slowly feeding patches to the maintainers.

That odd comment entered the tree with 2.1.68, and has been unchanged
since then.  Ever hesitant to accidentally remove a snippet of humor,
I would vote to leave this as is.
		/* I removed check for oif == dev_out->oif here.
		   It was wrong by three reasons:
		   1. ip_dev_find(saddr) can return wrong iface, if saddr is
		      assigned to multiple interfaces.
		   2. Moreover, we are allowed to send packets with saddr
		      of another iface. --ANK

Thanks for finding the other stuff.
