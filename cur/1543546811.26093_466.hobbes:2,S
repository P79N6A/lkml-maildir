... unless ufds had been swapped out and close() happens from another
thread while we are paging it in before copying the data out.

Ditto.

About the only case when program's behaviour is _not_ undefined with such
scenario is the following:
thread A:
	poll() on array including descriptor n
thread B:
	close(n);do something that leads to event on file that used to be
refered by n
everything else:
	make damn sure that no events on that file will happen until B
will do its thing.
Subtle, britlle and nonportable.
