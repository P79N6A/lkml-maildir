I've reviewed this (and the other related patches) affecting NUMA-Q
memory layout. I suppose I might be biased, but despite what others
might think, I'm really freaking impressed with how clean this stuff
is on top of the general awe factor for actually getting this stuff
going when I had trouble with it ages ago. Kudos!
