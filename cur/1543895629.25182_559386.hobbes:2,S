Sorry to tell you this, but anyone that makes a modification to GPLv2 covered 
code and distributes that modification is bound by the license. If a law 
makes following the license illegal, then they can't use any rights granted 
by the license. They are breaking the law by refusing to follow the license.

You marked the "requires" as an error. Technically it is. Practically, 
however, it is rare for a modification to not fall under the "distribution" 
part of the license, making the "release the source" requirement active 
almost all the time.

"More Developers" (either "Free Software" or "Open Source") == "More 
Contributions"
That equation is very simple to understand - claiming its wrong is impossible.

Apparently because you can't admit that a good reason *IS* a good reason when 
it conflicts with your belief that the FSF is correct. (The same as 
the "Science can't be right because it conflicts with the bible" I hear from 
all kinds of Xtians these days)
