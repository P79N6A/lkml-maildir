Much easier but
(a) against the spirit of the GPL, no source code to generate the headers
(b) it makes it harder for people other than Justin to work on the
    firmware.
IMNSHO the kernel should not contain generated files without the
support to regenerate them.  If that means a little more work for the
kbuild maintainers then so be it, I have done that extra work.
