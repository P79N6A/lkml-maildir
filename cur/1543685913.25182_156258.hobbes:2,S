It is incorrect to write NULL as a varargs argument.  It won't
necessarily pass a pointer because:
   1. a valid definition of NULL is "0".
If you want to pass a pointer to varargs, you might have considered
writing "(void *) 0", but that doesn't work because:
   2. a machine may have different sizes for different pointer types.
You must write "(type) 0" or "(type) NULL", using the correct pointer type.
