Jesse,
I already implemented (and tested) selective framebuffer/console
unregistration in my tree using your patch as a base. I'll send this
patch to akpm soon.
Geert,
Is this something that you might need for ps3fb? It should address 2 of
your concerns. The only thing is that you will need
CONFIG_VT_HW_CONSOLE_BINDING=y.  You can default this to 'y' in your
platform, or select it.
