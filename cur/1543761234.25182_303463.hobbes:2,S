I didn't see the original observation that bitfields are slow. If the 
argument was that loading a bitfield requires a load then mask, then 
you'll be happy to find that PPC has word, halfword, and byte load 
instructions. So loading a byte (unsigned, as Brad pointed out) should 
be just as fast as loading a word.

I understand. I was half being nitpicky, and half wondering if there 
was an actual reason I was missing.
