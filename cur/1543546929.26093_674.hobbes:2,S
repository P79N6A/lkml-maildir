Hi
I am trying to access a Sony DSC-F505V Digital Camera via USB and 
everything goes well until I try to mount the files system with:
mount /dev/sda -t msdos /mnt/camera
I get:
mount: fs type msdos not supported by kernel
If I try:
mount /dev/sda - t auto /mnt/camera
I get:
mount:  /dev/sda has wrong major or minor number
I get the same results with /dev/sda1
and ls -la /dev/sda gives:
brw-rw---- 1 root disk 8, 0 May 6 1998 /dev/sda
I have CONFIG_SCSI = m
and all  SCSI support types = m
CONFIG_FAT_FS=m
CONFIG_MSDOS_FS = m
CONFIG_VFAT_FS = m
cat /scsi/scsi gives:
Host:  scsi0  Channel:  00  Id:  00  Lun:  00
   Vendor:  Sony  Model:  Sony DSC  Rev:  2.10
   Type:  Direct-Access  ANSI SCSI revision:  02
Can anyone help me, please?
