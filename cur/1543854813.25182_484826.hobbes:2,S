This may be relevant to a post by jesse.brandeburg@gmail.com who
reported e100 as not working; perhaps if he uses a cross-over cable it
will "work" again.
I notice a patch in 2005 from Micahel O'Donnel to the e100.c driver has
stopped auto-crossover working on some e100 devices we use.
On one system the auto-negotiation was restored by commenting out:
(nic->mac == mac_82551_10) in function e100_phy_init where the MDI/MDI-X
is disabled.
lspci reports:
 01:04.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82557/8/9 [Ethernet Pro 100]
(rev 10)
 01:04.0 Class 0200: 8086:1229 (rev 10)
and on another device
 01:05.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corp. 82559ER (rev 10)
 01:01.0 Class 0200: 8086:1209 (rev 10)
So it is true that we are revision 10, but 82557/9 not 82551.
I must confess that having gotten this far, I am lost. Of course I can
"fix" the driver for our hardware but I am not sure how to contrive a
general fix.
Maybe the actual damage is done in
 e100_get_defaults(struct nic *nic)
where nic->mac is set to nic->rev_id ?
But it generally seems to be a failure to take into account the actual
hardware type, and only consider the revision.
Any ideas?
Sam
