Currently the system only generates one huge, whopping kernel-api.html
file.  So it's really a non-issue (make clean takes care of it, as noted
above).
But I agree with you -- kernel-doc.pl currently outputs man pages.  And
I think it would be handy to generate man pages for kernel API
functions.  (my patch only requires a little Makefile scripting in order
to do that)
So, there should definitely be a "Documentation/man" directory or
similar, which is treated just like the current "linux/modules"
directory is now.
