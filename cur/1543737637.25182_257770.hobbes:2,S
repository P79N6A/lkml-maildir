Ah.  That makes the question in your previous message make more sense
then.  What options do you pass to nm?
Looking at the output of nm -fsysv shows that currently the mapping
symbols are being incorrectly typed (the EABI requires them to be
STT_NOTYPE, but the previous ELF specification -- not supported by GNU
utils -- required them to be typed by the data they addressed.  I'll
submit a patch for that shortly).

In this case no, which is why I reposted the message without it.  It was
an oversight (I have to remove the boilerplate when I *don't* need it
rather than add it when I do).
