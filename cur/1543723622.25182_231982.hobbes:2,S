Actually, yes it is. While students can be warned about the results of 
fork bombing a system, both in terms of what happens to the system and 
to their access, it's far less obvious that starting a program which 
does a lot of threads is equally bad behaviour.
The desirability for per-user scheduling is also shown by the student 
who build a large project with "-j4" as a make option and "-pipe" as a 
compile option. Yes, it makes the program complete sooner, and it 
generally is done with no malice.
Hopefully some form of this will appear in the 2.7 kernel, although past 
discussions in several places have resulted in more heat than light on 
the topic.
