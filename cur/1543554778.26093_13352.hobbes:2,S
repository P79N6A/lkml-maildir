Well, while what you say makes sense, it isn't exactly a solution to our
problem.
we are trying to expose and set a NEW option altogether. So our question 
pertains more to what code we write in the kernel to create and expose a 
new custom option. so for this, we would need to know the offsets of the
current options like source routing etc and then hopefully try and stuff
data from setting our option after the maximum that can be set by these
other existing options.
once that code is in place within the ip_build_options routine in the
ip_options.c file in the linux kernel, we can then use the setsockopt() 
at the application level to make sure that a packet is filled with the
corresponding option.
i hope i was able to explain my question more clearly.
thanks for your help !
