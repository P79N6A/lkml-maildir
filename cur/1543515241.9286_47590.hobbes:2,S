We have to check for the magic because you can have a directory
/dev/pts but not devpts compiled into your kernel.  Therefore we need
a way to know exactly if devpts is available.

This comes from linux/fs/devpts/devpts_i.h.

Every filesystem has a magic number associated with it.  statfs gets
this numbers.

It's official - see above.
If devfs handles this differently and needs a patch, please tell us
what needs to be done - or change devfs accordingly.  Since devfs is
not part of the kernel and none of the glibc developers seems to use
and nobody else complained so far, this hasn't been fixed.
