1 MB isn't 1048576.
it's 1000000
mega isn't 2^10, it's 10^6
so where are YOU coming from?
(no, i'm not arguin, i don't particularly care.  but i'm
pointing out that some people have completely firmly set
definitions and some other people also have firm definitions
and neither will agree the other's right.  MiB is the international
standard for a 2^10 B(yte) specification.  so if you mean
2^10 bytes, you mean MiB, not MB, even if you don't like it :)
So these are very very good changes :)
