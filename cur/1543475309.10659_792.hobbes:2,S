Hi,
	I've been investigating the NFS over TCP and I think I might have
the bug but just need to know something about wake_up and
interruptible_sleep_on,
are wake_ups queued?
i.e. if I do a wake_up and then enter an interruptible_sleep_on will it
wake up? or do I need to send another wake_up?
Thanks,
	Dave.
