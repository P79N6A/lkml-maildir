That's the kernel side of the API. The userspace->kernel fd validation is 
done in eventfd_fget(), that the kernel uses to get an eventfd file* from 
an eventfd file descriptor. The eventfd_fget() does the file operations 
check and returns proper error.
At that point, if the kernel feeds eventfd_signal() with crap, it gets 
crap back. Like calling internal kernel functions with bogus mm_struct or 
task_struct.

Agreed. I'll leave the get_user(u64).
