   Note that "in_interrupt()" will also trigger for callers that call from
   bh-atomic regions as well as actual BH handlers. Which is correct - they 
   are both "interrupt contexts" as far as most users should be concerned.
   The unix domain case may well be bh-atomic, I haven't looked at the code. 
   I'm pretty much certain that the TCP case _will_ be BH-atomic, even for 
   loopback.
   David?
Unix sockets use non-BH locks, there are no software interrupts
involved in AF_UNIX processing so no need to protect against them.
The actual wakeup comes from the socket callbacks, we use the
default data_ready() which is:
void sock_def_readable(struct sock *sk, int len)
{
        read_lock(&sk->callback_lock);
        if (sk->sleep && waitqueue_active(sk->sleep))
		wake_up_interruptible(sk->sleep);
	sk_wake_async(sk,1,POLL_IN);
	read_unlock(&sk->callback_lock);
}
And for write wakeups Unix uses it's own, which is:
static void unix_write_space(struct sock *sk)
{
        read_lock(&sk->callback_lock);
        if (unix_writable(sk)) {
		if (sk->sleep && waitqueue_active(sk->sleep))
                        wake_up_interruptible(sk->sleep);
                sk_wake_async(sk, 2, POLL_OUT);
        }
        read_unlock(&sk->callback_lock);
}
So, to reiterate, no BH locking is used by AF_UNIX.
