Be warned.  The driver is marked HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL and it seem to work 
only on my machine.  Seems to have some problem with LBA48 support.
The datasheet initio posted on the website just contains register 
descriptions, which is much better than nothing but I still had to do a 
LOT of trial-and-error to make that thing quasi-working.  I've tried to 
contact them in many ways but couldn't get any response.  I'll probably 
get back to it in a few weeks.
I can write ATA drivers for most hardware in a few days given 1. 
actually useful datasheet 2. hardware at hand 3. an ENGINEER to talk to 
when I get stuck.  So, sign me up.
It will be nice to have some central web site / wiki / whatever to 
monitor progress, arbitrate jobs, provides link to relevant info and 
people (probably some of them being open-by-request) and possibly 
provide links to bugzilla entries.
