One more reply to this, I inserted some debugging info, and all
addresses that the kernel saw on this ioctl so far are:
127.0.0.1
the machine's address
the machine's broadcast address
85.85.85.85 which I used in testing Postfix' patches
192.255.255.255 <- that's a piece of junk
192.168.0.222 <- that's a piece of junk
I already used ifconfig on that machine to display configuration data.
I'll see if other addresses turn up.
