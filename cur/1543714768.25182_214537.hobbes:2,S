And there's a *lot* of them. Those half dozen or so patches earlier were
results of just a quick random skim of the list the coverity folks came up with.
It'll take a lot of effort to 'fix' them all, and given the non-severity
of a lot of them, I'm not convinced it's worth the effort.
Some of them are obvious bugs (like the edd patches), but others are
a little less obvious, and thats where a lot of time can be wasted.
I've lost motivation to dig further for the time being. Maybe later.
