Hi Nick,
Here are the results of the comparisons I said I would do.
no-hyperthreading:
	
http://developer.osdl.org/markw/dbt2-pgsql/282/
	- metric 2288.43
	- baseline
hyperthreading:
	
http://developer.osdl.org/markw/dbt2-pgsql/278/
	- metric 1944.42
	- 15% throughput decrease
hyperthreading w/ Ingo's C1 patch:
	
http://developer.osdl.org/markw/dbt2-pgsql/277/
	- metric 1978.39
	- 13.5% throughput decrease
hyperthreading w/ Nick's w26 patch:
	
http://developer.osdl.org/markw/dbt2-pgsql/274/
	- metric 1955.91
	- 14.5% throughput decrease
It looks like there is some marginal benefit to your or Ingo's patches
with a workload like DBT-2.  I probably don't understand enough about
hyperthreading, but I wonder if there's something PostgreSQL can do to
take advantage of hyperthreading
Anyway, each link has pointers to readprofile and annotated oprofile
assembly output (if you find that useful.)  I haven't done enough tests
to have an idea of the error margin, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's
at least 1%.
Let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to try.
Thanks,
Mark
