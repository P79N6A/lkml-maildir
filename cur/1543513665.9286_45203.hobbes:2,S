Sorry, my mistake, I was really free()ing it up before.

I know. This was the issue wi the Realtec 100Mbps ether chipset.
Fortunately I do not have _these_ problems, but I know my next projects
will use only Zilog products instead...
What is this GFP_DMA32 thing? As of 2.2.13ac14 I could not find any
definition nor reference.
For the future I have a suggestion. Someone really ought to write
something about memory allocation like Linus did for IO-mapping. This
would really be very helpful.
