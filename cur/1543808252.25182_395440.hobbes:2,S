Well, the b,t,l mapping, judging from libscg code, is as stable as the
ordering of the device nodes themselves, so it is not clear what the
advantage would be other than getting a uniform and artificial b,t,l mapping.
If hotplugging shuffles /dev/sg* between running $APPLICATION -scanbus and
$APPLICATION -dowhatever, the b,t,l will change as well.
