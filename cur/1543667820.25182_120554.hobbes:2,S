accel_cursor unconditionally sets FB_CUR_SETPOS. Can you write it
down to the TODO list to eliminate this? Cursor position lives 
in different registers than cursor enable/disable on my hardware...
And if we could rename FB_CUR_SETCUR to FB_CUR_SETVISIBILITY and
leave cursor->enable setting on accel_cursor's caller, it would
be even better.
And if we could change enable value to 0: disable; 1: enable;
2: disable due to blink (called from vbl), it would be even better,
as then fbdev which does hardware blinking could just completely
ignore changes which set only FB_CUR_SETVISIBILITY with enable == 2.
