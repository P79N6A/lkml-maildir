Lennart,
Your s270 platform driver needs a different home in the source tree
outside of drivers/acpi/, and the patch that adds it must add an entry
to MAINTAINERS.
lcd brightness platform support should talk to the existing
backlight stuff under sysfs.
wlan and bluetooth indicators/controls need to appear under
generic places under sysfs -- not under platform specific
files under /proc/acpi.
Yes, the existing platform specific drivers such as asus, toshiba, and
ibm
are bad examples.
thanks,
-Len
