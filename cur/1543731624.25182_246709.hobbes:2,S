Just another datapoint, an IBM blade with

makes it work. So it looks like a A2 vs. A3 (or
PCI_SUBSYSTEM_VENDOR_IBM ;) ) thing.
Btw., a ethtool workaround would be appreciated or is that even possible? I
tried ethtool -s eth1 speed 1000 duplex full port fibre autoneg off without
luck. But that was over a java-based VNC thing run remotely over SSH port
forwarding that gets keyboard mappings wrong, so I didn't spend too much
time playing around :-)
