A good starting point is the book "Linux Device Drivers" published by
O'Reilly Associates (with which I have no relationship other than as a
satisfied customer, depite my name). Details can be found at...
	
http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/linuxdrive2/
...regarding the second edition thereof - I have the first edition
myself, which covers the 2.0 kernel series, but I believe the second
edition covers the 2.4 series kernels, SMP and USB, all of which were
missing from the original.
Best wishes from Riley.
