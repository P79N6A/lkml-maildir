Note that my patch simply adds an enable to match the disable added by
the -rt patch.  I'm not sure where the disable originally came from, but
there are disable/enable pairs scattered throughout tlbflush.h in the
-rt patch.
If this one isn't necessary, then the others probably are not either.
In most cases there are 2 mcr instructions inside the critical section.
One for the dsb() and the other for the actual function.
Russell, is there a reason any of these sections should be atomic?
