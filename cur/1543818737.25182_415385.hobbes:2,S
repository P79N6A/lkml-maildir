Acrypto [1] - asynchronous crypto layer for linux kernel 2.6
New acrypto combined patch for 2.6.15 kernel tree has been released, which
fixes IPsec ESP4 tunnel mode processing and initialization dependency on
connector when acrypto is built statically.
Many thanks to Yakov Lerner for testing.
Patch [2] is available in archive [3].
New standalone acrypto source released. It is a sync with combined
patch, so it only includes resolution of dependency on connector when
acrypto is built statically. It is available in archive [3].
Main work is concentrated on 2.6.16 IPsec port, which was noticebly
changed after 2.6.15.
