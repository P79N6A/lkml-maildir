Subject: Problems with mounting filesystems from /dev/hdb (kernel 2.6.18.1)

Hi everyone,
Recently I've downloaded and compiled kernel 2.6.18.1. After installing
modules and kernel and updating Grub I rebooted my box and tried to
launch new kernel. Everything was launching nicely, but while loading
GDM the screen went black and I was unable to switch console (using
ctrl+alt+Fn). I've rebooted using single user mode and logged in as
root. What I've discovered is the fact that I cannot mount any
filesystem from /dev/hdb. All filesystems from /dev/hda work as they
ought to, but when I try to mount something from the second hard disk I
get:
# mount -t ext3 /dev/hdb1 /home
/dev/hdb1 already mounted or /home is busy
# umount /home
/home not mounted
Here you've got my /etc/fstab:
proc            /proc           proc    defaults        0       0
/dev/hda3       /               ext3    defaults,errors=remount-ro 0
   1
/dev/hda1       /boot           ext3    defaults        0       2
/dev/hdb1       /home           ext3    defaults        0       2
/dev/hda5       /usr            ext3    defaults        0       2
/dev/hda7       none            swap    sw              0       0
/dev/hdc        /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto 0       0
/dev/sda1       /media/usbdisk  vfat    user,auto       0       0
Currently I am using kernel 2.6.15 from Ubuntu repositories. All
filesystems work perfectly. Have you got any ideas what might be going
on?
Kind regards,
Jano
