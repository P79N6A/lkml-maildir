That's not an oops.  It's a debug warning.
You had non-uptodate buffers against an uptodate page.  This
is an absurdity, but is not harmful.
Clearing BH_Uptodate on a write error has always seemed weird.
The error handling needs a review/rethink.  Meanwhile I'll drop
a buffer_req test into those warnings to shut them up.
