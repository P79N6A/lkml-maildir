Subject: Bug in patch-2.2.0-pre3: CPU MHz in i386/setup.c

In patch-2.2.0-pre3 I found this horror:
***************
                if (c->x86_capability & X86_FEATURE_TSC) {
-                       p += sprintf(p, "cpu MHz\t\t: %lu.%06lu\n",
+                       p += sprintf(p, "cpu MHz\t\t: %lu.%02lu\n",
                                cpu_hz / 1000000, (cpu_hz % 1000000));
+++++++++++++++
  
First of all, it is WRONG. 350000025 Hz will be reported as 350.25,
350000250 as 350.250, and so on...
Secondly, the %06 was there because dosemu needs as much precision as
possible; this line was not intended to be read by a human and thus
please do not apply cosmetic patches to it.
I must add that pre-2.2 is for the moment a big step BACKwards compared
to 2.1.132. Netscape started crashing again every 5 minutes, not to add
the vfat code which not only reports partitions as full but WRITES junk
into them.
