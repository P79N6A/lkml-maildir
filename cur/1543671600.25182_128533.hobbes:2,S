That's exactly what I wanted to avoid : It we feed NULL (for a non PCI
device) to pci_map_single (for example), we limit the max DMA address
to 24 bits, and this is quite bad for an EISA device, which is 32 bits
capable.
This approch doesn't look better to me than the pci_* implementation,
while the one I suggested gives us some full control over the DMA
mask.
Or am I completly wrong ?
