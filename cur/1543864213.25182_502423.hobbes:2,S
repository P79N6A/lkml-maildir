Hi,
With kernel 2.6.19 I was able to boot using the pata_via driver
I tried to compile 2.6.20-rc6 and now I get a "unknown device: sda3"
error when I try to boot.
I compiled 2.6.20-rc6 by copying over the .config from the 2.6.19 tree
and running a make oldconfig && make
Am I doing something wrong?
Patrick
