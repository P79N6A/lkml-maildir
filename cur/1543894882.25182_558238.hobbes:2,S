Do you have example discs that can be mounted to test it?  If you do, I 
will consider doing it.
I have a couple of older DOS filesystems that got dropped out years ago 
that I actually need to mount disks that i may rewrite for 2.6.x.
Now all i need is the time.
And speaking of obscure information...
I have a bunch of PCMCIA spec documents from the PCMCIA standards 
association from the late 90s.  Would anyone involved in maintaining the 
PCMCIA code be interested in it?  (Especially if they are in Portland.) 
It has been a while since I have even needed to look at it and I hate for 
it to go to waste if it can be of any use.  (Bit late now, I know...)
