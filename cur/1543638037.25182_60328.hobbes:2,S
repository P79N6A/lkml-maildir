I intentionally made bias a non-precise field.  It really doesn't matter 
if it gets corrupted; it is just a rough idea of what's going on.  So 
there's no problem reading it without a lock.  If the value you read is 
wrong (or partial), then the worst that happends is bunch of NOPs before 
you try for the lock (an undesirable, but not disastrous occurance).

Check out the title of the thread...  Somebody has a real, reproducible 
deadlock on a rw_lock where many readers are starving out a writer, and 
the system hangs.
