For i386 this is pretty OK.
But what about other architectures?
Before applying this change I want to know the result on a few archs,
and anyway using a CONFIG option may be a safer choice for a while.

Please - use tabs for indention, not for alignment.
The below would look rather messy with tabs=4.
Almost everywhere tabs are used in Makefiles it is plina wrong.
Tabs are brillient for indention but you cannot just assume 8 spaces = a
tab. Not even at the beginning of the line.
If you have a nested if or something tabs are there to be used.
