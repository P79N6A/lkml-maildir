No, it is definitely not overestimated.
It is more likely to rather be the opposite and you will find this out if you
try to use dtrace or attend a demo.
Dou you know of any other system where you can say:
	Print me a strack trace with symbols for all processes on this
	computer (even stripped ones) that call gettimeofday() within the
	next few seconds.
Note that you do not need a special kernel, no reboot, no restart of 
applications.
There are a lot more possibilities including tracing kernel routines on a 
production kernel but it would take too long to describe them....
