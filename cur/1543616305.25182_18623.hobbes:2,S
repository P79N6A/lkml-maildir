I can think of that in a fast thought:
- if fsck.* can be there, it will make fs nice, just now they have to
  be able to fsck a ro root fs.
- I suppose that you can put here also the raid autodetect code and
  things like that.
- you also need a very small minishell, something like nash (that
  cames with mkinitrd will suffice).
  Basic utility here is that you want to have several small programs
  and have a small shell script to configure them (a distribution
  dont' want to recompile all its boot programs for each target
  configuration).
- as I suppose that you have supposed insmod is essential :)
- you already put there IP autoconfiguration.
Later, Juan.
