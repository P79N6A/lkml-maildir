It IS some "home phoning" and "spy software". However, when the 
goal is to sign you up for more direct marketing, people tend to 
object. When the goal is to keep track of running kernels, I'm
hopeful that people will recognise that this is different. 
A trick to use would be to send an UDP packet at boot (after 1 minute 
or so), and then randomly say "once a month" (i.e. about 1/30 chance of 
sending a packet on the first day) The number of these random packets
recieved is a measure of the number of CPU-months that the kernel
runs.
