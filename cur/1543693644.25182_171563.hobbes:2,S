Hello!
Is there _anyone_ responsable for the wireless (802.11*) drivers in the
Linux kernel?
I would like to have the following things (if possible) for all wireless
drivers:
   - easy interface = support for wireless tools
   - compatibility with 2.5/2.6 modul interface
   - support for AP-Master/AP/Ad-Hoc/Monitor Modus (like HostAP can do)
   - device naming scheme should be wlanX -> easier to see what it is
   - support for external encryption (kernel modules/user space) like WLSec
Have a nice day,
Nico
P.S.: Sorry for the crosspost!
