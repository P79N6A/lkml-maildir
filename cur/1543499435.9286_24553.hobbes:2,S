Well, the plot thickens. I tried the de4x5 driver on one of the machines
that was giving me trouble. It works with the card I'm using, but I got
this in the syslog (machine has been up for 8 hours, so far these are the
only occurrance):

I just ran ifconfig on the same machine, here is the output showing the
dropped packets:
          RX packets:9404330 errors:0 dropped:3055 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:12103834 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:3211336 txqueuelen:100
          Interrupt:11 Base address:0xb800
I'm not quite sure what it means by "insufficient memory"--the machine has
128MB of RAM and didn't show any signs of running out. Is this a packet
buffer it's reffering to?
