The DIO get_blocks is super-freaky at the moment, in that it passes
in an unsigned long max_blocks (units of blocks) but it expects the
filesystem to fill in a u32 b_size (in bytes).  This does at least
give the filesystem the hint that this was a monster write and it
gets the chance to allocate contiguously, but that was probably
unintentional, who knows?  I guess that subtlety would be dropped
with this change if b_size isn't made a 64 bit entity.

*shrug*... its all very closely inter-related, I'd keep it together.
I'd also thought that size_t was the right type here, not u64?  32
bit platforms aren't capable of submitting IOs this large, so they
needn't be doing any 64 bit manipulation here, no?
cheers.
