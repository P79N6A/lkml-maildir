Davem should know the right behaviour for this bit.  It's not a generic
"architecture" bit, but it has some defined behaviour behind it.  See
cachetlb.txt:
  void flush_dcache_page(struct page *page)
...
        There is a bit set aside in page->flags (PG_arch_1) as
	"architecture private".  The kernel guarantees that,
	for pagecache pages, it will clear this bit when such
	a page first enters the pagecache.
I think you may have broken this... ;(
