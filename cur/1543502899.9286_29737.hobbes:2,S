Can anyone tell me the significance of this device in the system?
I'm having various minor problems on one system I'm 'playing' with and one
difference between that and a standard Debian distribution is that if I
`echo hello > /dev/tty` on the Debian system, I get the hello written back
(just as if with using /dev/tty0 or /dev/console.  However, if I try the
echo statement above on the other system, I get:
cannot create /dev/tty: no such device or address
This indicates to me that the kernel isn't configured properly somewhere
along the way....
The device is there and identical on both systems `mknod /dev/tty c 5 0`
with perms 644 and owner root:root.
My reason for finding this is that when I start ash I get:
sh: can't access tty; job control turned off
And I've been trying to figure out why ash is complaining....  which lead me
to discover the tty problem above....
Any ideas?
Regards,
Kevin
