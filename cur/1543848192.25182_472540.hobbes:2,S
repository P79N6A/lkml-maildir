The main problem with that approach is that the offending boardmakers
tend to hide these details deep in technical docs that are not bundled
with the motherboard, and which consequently nobody actually reads.
Instead they see that NFS doesn't work, and conclude to waste NFS
community's time in debugging it.
We're still leaving a fairly large range of ports for the NFS client to
use: there should be 373 that are rife for the taking.

No arguments with this.
