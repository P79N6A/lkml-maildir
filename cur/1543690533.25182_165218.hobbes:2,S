I have a UML-under-Valgrind project on the backburner.  Valgrind has an
instrumentation mode which checks to see every memory access is covered
by appropriate locks in an MT program.  I'm afraid it will generate a
lot of noise in the kernel though, since there's a lot of code which
does unlocked memory access (probably correctly).
