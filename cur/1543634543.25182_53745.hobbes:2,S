Linux in a classic beowulf configuration scales just fine.   To be clear
I am talking a batch scheduling system, where the jobs which run for
hours at a time and on many nodes, possibly the entire cluster at a
time. Are scheduled on some number of commodity systems, with a good
network interconnect.
The concern now is not does it work, or does it work well.  But can
it be made more convenient to use.
