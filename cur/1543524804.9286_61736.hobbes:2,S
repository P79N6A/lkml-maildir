I know an excellent way to create corruption :)  Use the loop device
on an fs-in-a-box created with mke2fs -Fqb ${BLKSIZE} ${BOX} ${BLOCKS}.
What corruption happens is dependant on what blocksize the host fs is.
It gets more interesting when you use the same dirctory/file names on
two different fs with two different blocksizes.
Your buffer-4 fixed 99% of the trouble :) Replacing invalidate_buffers()
with destroy_buffers() got rid of the crumbs it was leaving around.

<sigh> P.S.
With the attached diag-diff, it almost works perfectly now.  (seems
to be a bit racy if you reuse too soon.  the hunk that seems likely
to make your facial expression change is why I'm attaching it.  I
really don't understand why it has to start with blocksize=PAGE_SIZE
to work right.. almost.. and hope some reader may know why:)
