Right, I don't disagree with you there.  FWIW, I can disable entire
parts of the application and have already narrowed down reproduction
of this issue to the 200 threads that make the webservice calls, so it
doesn't have anything to do with any of the GUI or other background
services that my application executes.

I'm curious to know how this problem would be easier to narrow down if
it were written in C.
