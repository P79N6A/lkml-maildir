2.6.odd/.even is actually a significantly different process.  a) because
there's only one tree, linearly growing.  That's considerably simpler than
maintaining a branch.  And b) because everyone knows that there won't be a
new development tree opened until we've all knuckled down and fixed the
bugs which we put into the previous one, dammit.
