In addition to earlier comments:
* should handle multiple interfaces, not just one static.
* the whole notifier fake arp call back is fugly
* use sysfs instead of /proc to handle the simple rxbuf_min,max stuff or use
  ethtool ring parameters
* proc module_owner not set, so ref counting not done.  Moot if you switch
  to sysfs.
* since you add ethtool for checksum,
  why not some basic stuff like driver info and carrier state?
* xen_net_read_mac seems like it could just be put inside driver.
* minor
	use free_netdev() rather than kfree in error path
	don't bother initializing .next/.priority in notifier_block if it is just 0
* what about mtu change?
* what about mac address change?
* Could you support scatter gather?
