ntp, either from network or from a radio-clock
and using set_mmss for that purpose seems not so disgusting, because :
- writing to the clock (the expected work of set_mmss) must be disabled when
we observe the clock drift
- set_mmss is always called with a very good precision, so one could
use the time given to set_mmss to compare it to the time given by the RTC
over a long enough period of time (more than 11 minutes) to compute the RTC's
drift and the necessary adjustment.
Of course, if we want something that is not based on ntp, then we may not
overload set_mmss.
