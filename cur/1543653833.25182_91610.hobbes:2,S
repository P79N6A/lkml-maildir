Try the driver from 2.4.20-rc2. There are some locking updates in the
ioctl code for setting the hw address. I'm running 2.5 (approx same
driver as 2.4.20-rc2) here and I observe that the address really does
change (i.e. I see packets on the wire with the new MAC addr) but the
kernel oopses shortly thereafter somewhere in the network stack. I'm
blaming this on 2.5 instability for the moment but will fix it if it
turns out to be ewrk3's fault.
