Since it is rather big,
I have posted a patch for the InfiniBand Access Layer (IBAL) 
for the linux-2.6.3 kernel on sourceforge in the file releases
area. 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/infiniband
We have already received some comments from Greg and others(such as 
not liking the Component library (Complib) abstraction layer)
and we are starting to make those changes. Greg suggested that
we submit the code to the larger Linux community for review, 
so here it is. 
Please let us know what other changes might be needed so that it is
acceptable for inclusion into the 2.6 base.
