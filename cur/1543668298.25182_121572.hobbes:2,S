Hi,
We've used Linux to access our cx600 and there were no problems.  One thing
to keep in mind is that you are only allowed to have a single initiator per
zone, otherwise you will run into problems.  When you create your zones make
sure that each zone only has a single HBA in it...  
Also, on your switch, look at the error counters.  If there are any 
number of CRC errors it may mean a bad cable.
What is the FC card and driver you are currently using?
