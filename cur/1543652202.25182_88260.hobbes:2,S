I'm not designing yet, just looking and what I see says that it
does not very much resemble the non panic case.

What I was thinking is that the process would for and exec
something like "/etc/rc 6" or maybe "/etc/rc 7" to be clean.
And that script would do all of the user space shutdown.
No need to mlock any pages, or hack init, or special hacks.
Just user space cleanly shutting itself down.

Mostly it's a bird in the hand versus a bird in the bush.  I simply
see nowhere that vmalloc makes my code simpler.

My feel is that kexec-on-panic is a rather different problem.  Which
is why I thought it all through, to see if they felt close.  At the
very least you almost need to know that it is the same.

Except for the part about getting Linus to accept it I don't see
the advantage.  kexec-on-panic looks different enough that I don't
think it will help at all with that case.
