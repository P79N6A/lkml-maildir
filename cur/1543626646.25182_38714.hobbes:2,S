There are some bug fixes to existing makefiles and CML1 that can safely
be fed back to 2.4, I will do them next week.  Apart from that, the
design philosophies for kbuild 2.4 and 2.5 are completely different,
there is little from kbuild 2.5 that can safely be extracted and back
ported to kbuild 2.4.
