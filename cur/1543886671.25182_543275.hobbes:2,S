The user can load whatever font they want.

No, most Fedora users use X -- and _everything_ in Fedora works fine
with UTF-8 and has done for years.

I have a serial terminal which can only do lower case (well, actually
capitals but it's all mapped to lower case since that's more useful).
When I write code on it, I can't do capital letters. But do I try to
_force_ you to use only capitals because of my limited terminal?
No. I don't. I can see what you've written just fine, within the
limitations of my terminal. 
So why are you trying to force me not to spell things correctly?
Go away.
