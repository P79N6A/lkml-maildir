Hi,
there is 2 parts to this question
first of all, glibc malloc doesn't always use mmap for it's allocations,
it's a split between the brk() area and mmap() depending on the size of
the allocation. (>= 128Kb uses mmap, smaller uses brk(). brk using
allocations will not end up in remove_vm_struct at all)
second of all, glibc delays freeing of some memory (in the brk() area)
to optimize for cases of frequent malloc/free operations, so that it
doesn't have to go to the kernel all the time (and a free would imply a
cross cpu TLB invalidate which is *expensive*, so batching those up is a
really good thing for performance)
I hope this answer helps you... it's probably worth reading the
malloc/malloc.c code in the glibc code tree, this behavior is documented
there...
