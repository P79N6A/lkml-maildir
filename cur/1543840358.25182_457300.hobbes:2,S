Hmm... I'm not sure if I understand this correctly. Can't we just
create the 3 new ioctls in the kernel and teach glibc to use it?
The compatibility ioctls would talk to new ioctls only and translate
things. Anything (userspace) wanting non-traditional speeds would
have to use new interface (i.e., be compiled against the new glibc)
and the speeds would show as EXTA or EXTB or something when queried
using old ioctl.
Yes, the binary interface between glibc and userland would change
(with compatibility calls translated by glibc to new ioctls, or to
old ones on older kernels).
The old ioctls would be optional in the kernel (and perhaps in glibc,
sometime).
Not sure if we want int, uint, or long long for speed values :-)
