Sorry about the duplicates, this is some initiative that exim - running on my 
laptop - has decided, on its own, to undertake, I am research int.  It has 
something to do with mails, apparently with some CC's undelivered, hanging 
around in the queue and runq sending duplicates of already-delievered copies.
For example, right now I have this hanging around in the queue, and I will 
eventually do a runq:
58h  1.4K 16Q3MS-0000lx-00 <phillips@bonn-fries.net>
          davidsen@tmr.com
        D andrea@suse.de
        D linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
But now I'm worried exim will send to andrea and lkml again.  Hmm.
Is this a bug?
