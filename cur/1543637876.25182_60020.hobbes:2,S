I think this would work best.  On PPC this would allow us to change the
mess of include/asm-ppc/serial.h into a slightly cleaner Makefile
(especially if we do the automagic <platforms/platform.h> or
<asm/platform.h> bit that's been talked about in the past) magic and we
could use that object file as well in the bootwrapper as well.
