#define CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE     1
Hmm. That one is obvious right? 
	cp /bin/sh /tmp
	chown root /tmp/sh
	chmod 4755 /tmp/sh
#define CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH  2
Hmm. OK, I can now read any file on the system. Read /etc/shadown, 
crack passwords from there. SOrry, there isn't any quicker way.
#define CAP_FOWNER           3
Hmm. I now "own" /etc/ password?
#define CAP_FSETID           4
Hmm. Something similar to: 
	cp /bin/sh /tmp
	chown root /tmp/sh
	chmod 4755 /tmp/sh
But now the chown won't work, so I'll ahve to work from a file that
happens to be root-owned already. 
#define CAP_KILL             5
Hmm. Nasty DOS. Turn on debugging on various servers etc etc. Ok. Maybe
I can't become "root" immediately. 
#define CAP_SETGID           6
Hmm. Go to any group (e.g. "disk" or "ppp" and do funky stuff!).
#define CAP_SETUID           7
	setuid (0,0)
#define CAP_SETPCAP          8
	Hmm I can't ADD to my permitted set. Too bad. 
#define CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE  9
	OK. I can't become root with this. But I can cover my tracks
	which I shouldn't be able to do. 
#define CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE 10
	- Bind to the portmapper, distract clients to my own nfs server.
	have clients to nasty things (to make me root)
	- rsh into local machine with false credentials. 
#define CAP_NET_BROADCAST    11
	Hmm. No, maybe not a route to "root". 
#define CAP_NET_ADMIN        12
	Mjam. Ifconfig an interface to an IP of a trusted host. Dump
	packets on the net until I see "root" login?
Need I go on? 
Many have a route to "root". The things you normally restrict to
"root" have that status, because they are dangerous to the local
machine. Someone smart will be able to leverage it to "root" (or full
capabilities) pretty easily. 
And being "root", you suddenly own lots of files on the
filesystem. This means that you can modify for example the
"bootfiles", to give access (full capabilities) to some program, or
uid.
