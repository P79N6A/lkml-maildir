It is doing arp but not during tftp download (DECstation - Playing
around with Linux/MIPS). This is something
ever worked with 2.0 which i stumbled over going to 2.2. I was
wondering why arp entrys expire that fast.

This is exactly what i did - but i was wondering if this wouldnt
cause much more ARP traffic when the arp entry does expire more quickly ?
