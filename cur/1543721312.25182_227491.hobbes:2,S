Looks good. And for 2.6 no need for two steps "make zImage" and "make modules".
'make' alone will do the job and make sure zImage and modules are consistent.

And here is my point. How to you put this info in less than one line?
So I just see proff that we need to be able to give a bit more info
about the possible targets.
"which requires extra parameters...." is also a sign that more 
info would be nice.
Now I have to read and understand a Makefile to find the info.

For arm it looks simple, but for ppc the commandline to mkuboot.sh
varies depending on configuration.
Better do this in the kernel.
