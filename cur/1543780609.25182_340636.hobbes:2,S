The chance for a lookup hit to happen on a hash value which is in a
modified-state in a different CPU's cacheline should be pretty small
(depends on the architecture also, but shouldnt be much of an issue I
guess).
Hoping on that, guaranteed validity of data is not necessary, it is OK
to be incorrect occasionally.

Well, not really "good approximation" it sounds to me, the sensibility
goes down to L1_CACHE_LINE/sizeof(u32), which is:
- 8 on 32-byte cacheline
- 16 on 64-byte cacheline 
- 32 on 128-byte cacheline
Right?
So the (nice!) refault histogram gets limited to those values?

True, but it guarantees disabled preemption. No big deal...
