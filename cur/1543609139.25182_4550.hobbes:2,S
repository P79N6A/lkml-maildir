I get a seg fault on both 2.2 and 2.4 kernels by running the following
one-line C program:
	int main() { int k =  (int *)0x0; }
Debugging the offender,
	int main() { int k =  (int *)0xc0000000; }
is not very informative: single-stepping over the sole command just
hangs, and you have to press Control-C to interrupt gdb, at which point
you can single-step right into the same problem again.
When the program hangs, 'top' says that the CPU is fully utilized and
the system is spending 80% of its time in the kernel and 20% in the
offending process.
Have you not been able to duplicate it on a 2.4 kernel on x86?  If not,
please tell me which 2.4 kernel correctly seg faults.
