Or not. I had an FC3/x86-64 system until two days ago, now I have FC5/86-64.
When FC3 was installed I chose to format the partitions to XFS and since 
then
I had Oopses regularly with or without VMWare modules.
I have run memtest64+ for 12+ hours and it indicated two separate single bit
errors in the topmost  64MB of my 1GB. Since then I was running with
mem=960M but I still got Oopses on a bit heavier disk loads and every time
XFS was involved.
I backed up my /home with rsync to a new harddisk in single mode,
the new disk was formatted to EXT3. During the backup I had Oopses
about 5 or 6 times and I had to reboot. Rsync was able to continue,
that's why I chose that for backup...
I installed FC5 using only EXT3 partitions and copied my 80+ GB data
back to /home. Guess what? No Oopses...
