	Most of these NGOSes will be built, in whole or in part, with the
OSKit and hance out of bits of Linux.  Of course the glue logic and lack
of special-case optimizations will mean that these NGOSes will be slower
than Linux 2.2, but I'd be surprised if the NGOSes were slower than even
2.0.  It would be hard to screw the Linux-based components up *that*
badly.  The U of U guys did a really killer job on the OSKit and are
continuing to improve it.

	I do not think that blindly adhering to an obsolete design until
the last scrap of performance has been wrung from it when a clearly
superior alternative is available and free is a very wise use of
programmer resources.

	Few of which are specific to the Unix API, and most of which could
be pilfered for use in an NGOS easily.  Exactly why is this relevant?

	So do I.  More so than in the past, for sure.  That also has
nothing to do with the NGOS-replacing-Linux question.

	Sure.  Linux is still the place to be.  But so is Java, and if you
take a look at what Kaffe+OSKit looks like, it starts to look mighty
attractive as well.  A lot of people are pretty impressed with it, myself
included.

	Certainly not.
