Note that might_sleep() already does a cond_resched() on the 
configurations that need it, so I am not sure what you are getting at 
here.  Is that not enough?

I dont quite understand this part either.  From my perspective, 
rt_spin*() functions are locking constructs that might sleep (or might 
spin with the new patches), and they happen to be BKL and wakeup 
transparent.  To me, either the might_sleep() is correct for all paths 
that don't fit the in_atomic-printk exception, or none of them are.
Are you saying that the modified logic that I introduced is broken?  Or 
that the original use of the might_sleep() annotation inside this 
function is broken?
