Sorry my confusion I thought mmapping /dev/mem increased the page count,
in which case it would be easy to detect, and avoid.  I just looked
and it doesn't so there appears no trivial way to detect or handle
that case.

Doesn't the AGP aperture cause a physical alias?  Leading to strange
the same problems if the agp aperture was marked write-back, and the
memory was marked uncacheable.  My gut impression is to just make the
agp aperture write-back cacheable, and then we don't have to change
the kernel page table at all.  Unfortunately I don't expect the host
bridge with the memory and agp controllers to like that mode,
especially as there are physical aliasing issues.

My preferred fix is to use PAT, to override the buggy mtrrs.  Which
brings up the same aliasing issues.  Which makes it related but
outside the scope of the problem.
