Subject: [PATCH 3/3] HostAP: fix Kbuild warning

The dependency on NET_RADIO is useless, because we select already it indirectly,
through IEEE80211.
The "recursive dependency" warning is actually IMHO partially wrong in this
context (we don't have a recursive dependency, but we *do* have recursion in the
code, for the way we recurse on "select" dependencies), but fixing it properly
doesn't seem easy (and I've not the time for this).
