I tend to agree with Greg, though this exposes one of the great tradeoffs 
of the driver model. We can consolidate data structures and operations on 
them into common ones, but sooner or later, we have to call down to the 
bus (or class)-specific objects, necessitating a conversion to the 
relevant object. 
The current infrastructure was designed the way it is to provide seamless 
transition while features of the generic model evolved. This is precisely 
why the bus drivers provide intermediate calls for the generic struct 
device_driver. The thought was that one day we could hopefully convert 
everything to the generic way and everything would be fantastic. 
Along they way, we've found several things stand in the way of making this 
a smooth transition, so the plan is to stick with the bus intermediaries 
until the infrastructure matures enough to tackle those problems more 
easily.

[ Replying to James... ]
I don't see how your patch adresses chaining; there is only one notifier 
per bus type.
On the other hand, I've considered implementing something like before 
(Most recently in the last couple of days). Essentially, one could have 
components register with a subsystem (e.g. bus type), that are called when 
a device is added or removed. 
This would make conditional features and extensions easy to call. For
example, drivers/pci/proc.c could register with the PCI bus to be called 
each time a device was added. This would eliminate uglies like:
int pci_proc_attach_device(struct pci_dev *dev);
#ifdef CONFIG_PROC_FS
        pci_proc_attach_device(dev);
#endif
Ditto for usbfs. 
It would also provide a means to eliminate the power management 
information in struct device, as PM could be an extension of the top-level 
device subsystem, only called if CONFIG_PM is set. 
However, there are a few details that are kinda nasty (like associating 
data between the extension and the device), and I've shelved the idea 
again..
