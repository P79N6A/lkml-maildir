I don't think that's the right thing to do: People will read it and
actually believe it because they think M$ can't afford to spread lies.

Show them users like Slashdot or deja.com - users we're sure we won't lose
to them and we're sure to get all the information from. ;)

They are publically spreading misinformation about Linux, and probably
even managing to scare users away because to someone who doesn't know
their "facts" are plain wrong, their arguments sound logical. We cannot
permit that.

They can't ignore us if we threaten with legal steps.

There is, for example, no case whatsoever where a swap file is limited to
128 MB.

Non-developers can do most of the writing - there are a number of people
out there who'd like to help but aren't familiar with programming.

I've never been good at fixing bugs I can't reproduce. I haven't seen any
problems with IDE, SMP, Network or crashes in 2.2.13prex or 2.3.19. (Ok, I
haven't been running 2.3.19 for long...)
