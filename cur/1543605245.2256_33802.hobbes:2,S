Subject: Fwd: VM testing with mtest, 2.4.12-ac3, 2.4.12-ac3+riel's patches, and 2.4.13aa1

This is a report of the mtest01 scripts posted by rwhron@earthlink.net a day orso ago.
Hardware:
K6-3 450
256MB ram
122MB swap
ATA/100 IBM disk
All the tests were run on a fresh boot, in single user mode.  The test consists
of running the mtest script and playing an mpg with mpg123.
The numbers are rather interesting.  While the latency of the ac kernels is
definitely better, the song only dropped out for a second or two in the
begining but that was it.  The aa kernel drops out more frequently throughout
the test, but the amount of memory allocated is almost twice as much as with the
ac kernels.
Hope this report helps, thanks to rwhon for the scripts, seem like a good
testing tool, and thanks to AC for keeping Riel's VM alive, and thanks to Rik
and Andrea for two great VM's.  It is nice to see two competing ideas and how
they fair against each other.
Attached is the vmstat output and mtest summarys for the tests.
