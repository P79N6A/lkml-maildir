intel doesn't know which way operands should be written, etc. Just like the
war between little- and bigendians.
The AT&T syntax is sort of standard in the Unix world. It is what the
native Linux assembler uses, so to use intel syntax in a piece of the
kernel, and AT&T syntax in the rest, was just plain confusing. Plus a
separate tool was needed just for building the kernel, plus the need to
mess with an obsolete object format.
