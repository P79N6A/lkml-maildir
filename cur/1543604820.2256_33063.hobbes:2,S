Unfortunately I have no way to ascertain that, but I do know it's
running Debian. I would venture a guess that it's a series 2.2 kernel. I
tried a nmap fingerprint, but it couldn't identify the kernel.

You have no problem with the reiceiver immediately acking PSH segments?
Shouldn't we be robust against this kind of behaviour? [Otherwise a
sender can force us into a permanent quickack mode simply by setting PSH
on every segment.]
