At what point in this process will pthread_create() return? It actually returns
very fast - the slow part is getting to the first line of the function that is
being passed to pthread_create() in the newly created thread. 
My guess is that clone() should return very fast to the original thread, but
might take a while to return to the newly created thread, which is what is
causing the problem.
