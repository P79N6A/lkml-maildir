Depending on your debugger, they may not be pointless.

Hint: your debugger already needs to know this.  GDB already does.  It
has a list of signals not to bother stopping or displaying to the user.
SIGCHLD is on it by default.  If not, you'd see the debugger prompt
after each one of these context switches.
