Hi Pete,
could you please change the order of the two functions, so that you 
don't have to put the forward declaration here?

I'd say this is a little bit overcommented.

Fair enough, thanks.
Besides the trivial nitpicks above, I think that this fixed version is 
fine. So as soon as you have the VIDs and PIDs of the hardware which 
requires this, could you please update the patch and send it to me again?
Thanks,
