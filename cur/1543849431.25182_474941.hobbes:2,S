Not quite.  diffstat doesn't understand renames and such, you want to  
use something more like this:
git diff -M --stat --summary master..for-linus
git log --pretty=short master..for-linus | git shortlog
As an example, if you rename foo/bar/baz.c to foo/bar/quux.c and  
change a few lines, you'll get something like this:
foo/bar/{baz.c => quux.c}  | 8 +--
It similarly makes renames between directories look nice.

Yes

Well, sorta.  If it's a pseudo-published development and you actually  
_don't_ _care_ what the old history was (because it was broken or  
incorrect or one of the patches got corrupted during import) then go  
ahead and wipe it out.  On the other hand if you have random people  
pulling from your published tree then you can't safely git-rebase or  
cg-admin-rewrite-hist or similar.  Luckily GIT will just complain  
about a discontinuous history as opposed to losing data.
