I don't think this one is worth it. If the user unmaps or changes the 
mapping from under the futex, I just think that is "user error". And the 
same way it is totally undefined what happens if one thread re-organizes 
the VM space while another thread may be doing some other operation 
(read() or similar), we just don't care.
