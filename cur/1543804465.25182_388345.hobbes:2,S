But your comment, James, said:
 * This is used to allocate a memory region from a bitmap.  The idea is
 * that the region has to be 1<<order sized and 1<<order aligned (this
 * makes the search algorithm much faster).
So, like the other Paul said:

I thought that the span had to be a power of two.  Perhaps
you mean 128, not 126 (order 7: 2**7 == 128).
And I thought, from your comment above, that if the span was
128, then the alignment had to be 128 as well.
