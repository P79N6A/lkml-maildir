Steve,
Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, but it doesn't seem to apply cleanly
here:
patching file drivers/char/rtc.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 384 with fuzz 2.
Hunk #2 FAILED at 396.
Hunk #3 FAILED at 417.
Hunk #4 FAILED at 582.
Hunk #5 FAILED at 605.
Hunk #6 FAILED at 900.
Hunk #7 FAILED at 918.
Hunk #8 FAILED at 999.
Hunk #9 FAILED at 1018.
Hunk #10 FAILED at 1285.
Hunk #11 FAILED at 1294.
Hunk #12 FAILED at 1304.
11 out of 12 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file drivers/char/rtc.c.rej
