applied patches 1-3, thanks much.
Small administrivia request, though:  after using my patch merging 
script to merge your patches, I have to do the following things manually:
* delete diffstat output
* delete patch filename
* un-indent patch description text
It would be great if I didn't have to do those manual steps :)
On the other hand, I really like your "patch 0/N" email with a 
description of the entire patchset.  Keep sending those, thanks.
Everything else looks great.
	Jeff
