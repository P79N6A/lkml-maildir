It's correct.  Had the fan in my server not died last night, I'd have
gotten some of these fixes to Linus.  God how I hate anything with fans
in.  They're the number one cause of failure.
The problem is that the interrupts are claimed before pcmcia has been
properly initialised, so the cs.c-private bits of pcmcia_socket aren't
setup.
