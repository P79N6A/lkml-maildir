I am writing a filesystem driver for the Sega Dreamcast Virtual Memory Unit 
(vmu) for 2.4 and have:
* Got read (in every way afaics) to work fine
* Added ability to delete files
* Added ability to copy a file on top of an existing file
(see the cvs for the project if you need to know more - follow the link off 
http://linuxdc.net
)
But, I cannot work out how to add the ability to, say, mv a file:
mv /somedirectory/ext2file /mnt/vmu/ext2file
or
cp /somedirectory/ext2file /mnt/vmu/ext2file
What calls do I need to implement to ensure that these two command actually 
work (at present they fail reporting that /mnt/vmu/ext2file does not exist).
Sorry to add to the traffic on this list but googling and various newsgroup 
searches have failed to tuen up the answers I need and the souce is very 
complicated.
