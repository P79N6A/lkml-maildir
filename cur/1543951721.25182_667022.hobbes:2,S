Oddly enough, the patch had no effect whatsoever (at least with the
ALSA drivers: I didn't try building a kernel with the OSS "sb" driver).
Just to make sure I wasn't "benefiting" from initialization inherited
from a prior boot, I even powered-down the machine for 30 seconds
before booting on the new kernel.  snd-sb8 still works, and snd-es18xx
is still broken (in exactly the same way as before).
