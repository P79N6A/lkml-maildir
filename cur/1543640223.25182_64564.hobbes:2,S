The way you suggested to check for the first kernel version that was
broken works if you want to find the exact version when something breaks
e.g. between -pre3 and -pre6. Between two major releases of Linux there
are
1. too many releases and
2. the development kernels might be broken in _many_ different ways which
   would make it hard to find the version where the current breakage
   occured first; and not to forget
3. it costs much time to compile try let's say 40 different kernels (not
   to mention that each of them has its' unique bugs)

Someone with a better knowledge of ATAPI might be able to understand what
the error messages say and to either understand the problem or to tell how
to trace it down.
