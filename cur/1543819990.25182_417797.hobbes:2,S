Actually, for a more elegant API the default should be to check and there 
should be a flag PT_SC_MASK_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_SYSCALL (reworded in some clearer 
way, it doesn't mean to ignore the syscall but the bits - IGNORE should be 
something like "be comprehensive with me when you check". Maybe 
ACCEPT_UNKNOWN_SYSCALL).
