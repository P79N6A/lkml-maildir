They aren't.  The rule is:
	DO NOT INCLUDE KERNEL HEADER FILES IN USERSPACE TOOLS.
Please read the archives for lkml on why this is true.
Yeah, we do need a way to have "sanitized" kernel headers so that
userspace can include them, but for now, use what your libc provides.
So please use the headers that are present in the lmsensors project, or
copy those headers into your project.
I don't want this thread to drag out into the usual argument for or
against this issue, please.

Sorry you feel that way, but the i2c header is not going to be any
different than any other kernel header at this time.
