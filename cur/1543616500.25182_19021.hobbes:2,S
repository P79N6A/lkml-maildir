I keep on seeing these "Blackbox" apps like Tivo using Linux but the
fact remains the average folks cannot get any reasonable kind of A/V
performance and support under Linux.    That's what we need.
Needing to save money and get some fast cash (I'm unemployed), 
yesterday, I swapped out my dual P-III motherboard in my BeOS box
for a Via C-III (700MHz) based system.    And I got my first real hiccups
while using the OS when I was playing MP3s and _launching_ the TV
program _full screen_(640x480 on 640x480 virtual desktop window).
Obviously, when this stuff is done right, more CPU power can only help,
but it still has to be done right.  As I am sure that you know, BeOS claims
average latency of 250 microseconds.
