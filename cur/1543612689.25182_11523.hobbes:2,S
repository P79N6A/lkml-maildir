Subject: two many zlib's in the kernel

Seems someone duplicated the zlib.  One copy is in ppp the other is in
jffs2 as I listed below they are virtually identical.  The problem is
you can't compile both in the kernel at the same time for obvious
reasons.  Since I don't know the build code maybe someone else would
like to fix it?
./fs/jffs2/zlib.c
./drivers/net/zlib.c
diff ./fs/jffs2/zlib.c ./drivers/net/zlib.c
