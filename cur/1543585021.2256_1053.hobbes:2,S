Hi Rik,
    Thanks for the explanation.  It brings another question to mind.  Lets
assume that I have two 16M processes and 32M of swap space.  Both the
processes have been swapped out at some point in time so the swap space is
full.  A third process is running and tries to allocate some memory, and
the kernel has no free pages.  Since swap is full, will the kernel kill my
process, or will it try and page out one of the processes that does have
space on swap?
Thanks,
Jim
