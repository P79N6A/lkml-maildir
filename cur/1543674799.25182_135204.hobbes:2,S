It seems the following link error comes from Linus' tree:
<--  snip  -->

...
net/built-in.o(.text+0x10b278): In function `r_start':

net/built-in.o(.text+0x10b321): In function `r_next':
: undefined reference to `router_devlist'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
<--  snip  -->
r_start and r_next are in net/wanrouter/wanproc.c.
