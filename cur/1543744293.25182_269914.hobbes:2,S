Subject: broken gcc 3.x update ("3.4.3""fixed")

Apropos of the recent "older compilers" discussion,
the string literal concatenation pre-processor bug
that I mentioned encountering in gcc-3.3.x and
gcc-3.4.[0,1] appears to be fixed in gcc-3.4.3.
(It was not the well-known "##" token pasting
pre-processor bug, incidentally.)
I've only tested with glibc-2.2.5 so far,
but I could reproduce it before with both
glibc-2.2.5 and glibc-2.3.2, so it probably
really is fixed.
