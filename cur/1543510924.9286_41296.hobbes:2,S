Larry is good at insulting people. However will people please take this
stupid thread off here and to the bitkeeper list. Better yet read the
bitkeeper list archive if there is one (and ask lm why not if there isnt)
Larry has already answered/insulted/bragged all of these points repeatedly
before on that list. You can go read it save him doing it again
