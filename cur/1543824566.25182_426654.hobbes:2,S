This is apparently difficult with COTS hardware in some cases.

The problem with the per-driver approach to porting, is that this is
only possible if you have a limited (known) number of devices in your
system.
There is code which promotes any IRQ shared with SA_NODELAY to
SA_NODELAY, and at least on PCI, that is where you get cascading
collisions between the drivers that have been adapted with the ones that
have not.
