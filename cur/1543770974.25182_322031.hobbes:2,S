it's the fundamental unfairness of the interactivity code (or any 
interactivity code that plays favorites between tasks), and the larger 
pipe buffers made this more common it seems. It's quite dangerous to 
tune the scheduler so close to 2.6.12, but the issue seems serious 
enough. I think we could try to change INTERACTIVE_DELTA from 2 to 3 (or
even 4) instead of turning off the back-into-the-active-array logic
altogether.
Pekka, i've attached a quick hack that turns INTERACTIVE_DELTA into a 
runtime tunable. It defaults to the stock value of 2, but a value of '5' 
should be equivalent to the other patch you tried (but is less hacky).  
Now, assuming you can confirm that doing:
  echo 5 > /proc/sys/kernel/INTERACTIVE_DELTA
fixes the problem (all other things should be back to the default, i.e.  
no renicing of anything), then it would be interesting to find the 
minimum value where the problem goes away. I.e. we know that 2 is bad, 
but how bad are values 3 and 4?
