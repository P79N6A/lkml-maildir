So, I've run 2 tcpdumps - on server and on client. Woooo... Looks bad.
With 2.4 (_on the server_) the client reads about 8K at a time, which is
sent in 5 fragments 1500 (MTU) bytes each. And that works. Also
interesting, that fragments are sent in the reverse order.
With 2.6 (on the server, same client) the client reads about 16K at a
time, split into 11 fragments, and then packets number 9 and 10 get
lost... This all with a StrongARM client and a PCMCIA network-card. With a
PXA-client (400MHz compared to 200MHz SA) and an on-board eth smc91x, it
gets the first 5 fragments, and then misses every other fragment. Again -
in both cases I was copying files to RAM. Yes, 2.6 sends fragments in
direct order.
Thanks
