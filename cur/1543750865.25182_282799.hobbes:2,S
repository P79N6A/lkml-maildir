Ya know what, I haven't tried any of the 2.6.8 kernels at all, so maybe 
for that binsearch I could start at 2.8-final? All this, of course after 
testing a full powercycle, as you suggested.
And another thing.. something with libata doesn't jive right with my 
sata drives.  I have 2x74 GB SATA western digital raptors in a Raid 1 
configuration, and it panics if I don't use the pre-libata drivers. I'll 
write up another post about this one -- maybe I'll ask Jeff 
Garzik about this, too, as he works on libata.
Thanks,
