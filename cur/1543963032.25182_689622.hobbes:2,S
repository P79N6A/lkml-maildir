It don't necessarily need to know. It can swap two used blocks, one 
often-used and one
rarely-used.  That way the rarely-used block is rewriten over the 
previously busy
block, and the busy block is moved to the rarely used area that isn't worn.
This implies an extra write whenever a busy block is moved.  Don't know if
anybody do this, but the technique is simple enough.
CF-filesystem separation is necessary, for they can't know in advance what
filesystem or partitioning scheme will be used.  (I have ext3 on CF, for 
example...)
