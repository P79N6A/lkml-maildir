Regarding draft 7:
(1) Great work on the SAMBA bullet.  I like it very much the way it is.
(2) Things I would still remove:
  "and eager users are already reaping its benefits."
  "cost-effective"
  "easy-to-use external devices"  (Why do we care if the devices
themselves are easy to use?)
(3) I quibble about the Linux-being-"an operating system." bit.  Since
we're including a background section at all, I think we could clear up
the Linux/GNU/GNULIX/Lignux thing easily enough using the first
paragraph of my original draft's background.
(4) Standardize the punctuation on the bullets.  Put a period at the end
of all of them, or none of them.  (I elect all, since some of the
bullets are multiple sentences.)
Since the two forks are getting much closer together, draft 5 on my site
(
http://bigred.lcs.mit.edu/~krose/linux2.2.0pr-f1.html
) will look very
similar.  Some other things I changed:
 * Added my comments about distribution licensing.
 * Added "prohibitive pricing" as being a motivating factor for Linus'
work.
 * Changed all URL's to a consistent format (i.e., enclosed in
parenthesis, so as not to confuse brain-dead web browsers that don't
understand text/plain, and so less work has to be done to convert it to
HTML.)
