I have to say, it sounds not just like a reasonable assumption, but like 
the only sane assumption that there _could_ be.

It absolutely _has_ to be done from setup_arch() or earlier, as shown by 
the fact that "setup_per_cpu_areas()" is the very next thing that 
init/main.c calls (and clearly, that needs to know what CPU's are 
possible).
ppc64 certainly calls it early enough, as does x86/x86-64/ia64. I don't 
see anybody else doing it too late either.
Heiko, can you point to the "old comment" you mentioned in the email, or 
the architecture that does this wrong?
