It does not work for me.  It appears to be working (the apps look like 
they are playing an MP3, but no sound).
.config
CONFIG_SND=y
CONFIG_SND_OSSEMUL=y
CONFIG_SND_MIXER_OSS=y
CONFIG_SND_PCM_OSS=y
CONFIG_SND_YMFPCI=y
lspci:
Multimedia audio controller: Yamaha Corporation YMF-744B [DS-1S Audio 
Controller] (rev 02)
(And I know that the default mixer settings are mute... blah,blah).
Any suggestions?
