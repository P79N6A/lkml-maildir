Looks like the git-pasky-0.7 tags (and friends) are now dead links. For 
example:
[philip@xray cogito]$ cg-mkpatch git-pasky-0.7:HEAD
.git/objects/c8/3b95297c2a6336c2007548f909769e0862b509: No such file or 
directory
fatal: cat-file c83b95297c2a6336c2007548f909769e0862b509: bad file
Invalid id: c83b95297c2a6336c2007548f909769e0862b509
Is there any way to recover that, or has the timeline been irrevocably 
altered, and we're all now doomed to meet bastard daughters of long dead 
crew members? [grin]...
:v)
Actually, I really liked that Enterprise-C episode...
