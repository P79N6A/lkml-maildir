I have finally received a new batch of CF cards (Mittoni brand) and these do 
not have the problem with data corruption as the Sandisk cards did.  So this 
fault is specific to one batch of Sandisk cards (so far)
Rogier has written below what might be causing this and I would like to try 
fixing it...gulp!  Can anyone spare a minute to point out the function I need 
to change to test the suggested "fix"?  I've looked around a bit and the 
closest I got was to finding an "outsl" function but can't find where the 
actual data is written to the device...
