this is exactly why I'm making this change: so you can still add
might_sleep in a inline path expected to run a zillion times. With
Ingo's change you would be doing cond_sched internally to might_sleep, I
do the other way around so might_sleep remains a debugging statement.
As Ingo basically showed (and I agree), all current might_sleep seems
suitable to be converted to cond_resched. I checked all them and there's
none that seems to be called in a loop for no good reason. the ones in
the semaphore are quite nice too since it's better to schedule right
before taking the semaphore than after getting it. The one in the
semaphore and in the copy-user are the only place where preempt seems to
be lower overhead but in most other places a spinlock is being taken
very near to the cond_resched.

I think it's a mistake to believe people that leaves preempt off don't
care about lowlatency (this is also why I always keep this change in my
tree)

having a CONFIG_PREEMPT in the above code, means you believe the people
who leaves preempt off don't care about lowlatency and that's really not
true. Ingo's effort as well shows people care about lowlatency even with
preempt off.
The people who leaves preempt off simply thinks they can get the same
lowlatency but with less overhead in the locks (though there will be
cond_resched in the semaphore, but semaphore is less performance
critical than the spinlock normally, and semaphore is usually hold for a
longer period of time, short critical sections would better go with the
spinlock anyways to avoid overscheduling).

Arjan's or Ingo's? I've seen Ingo's patch but maybe I missed Arjan's one.
