   On another topic, I'm considering having $8 continue to be current
   and using the two-insn stack mask to get current_thread_info and
   measuring the size difference that makes.
I might put 'current' into %g7 on sparc but currently I don't think
it's worth it myself.
BTW, your "4 issue" comments assume the cpu can do 4 non-FPU
instructions per cycle, most I am aware of cannot and I think ia64
even falls into the "cannot" category.  Doesn't it?
