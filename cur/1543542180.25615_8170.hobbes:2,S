Any single.

I don't understand this. If the user wants I/O to come in in order to 
a particular thread, the user can make it predictable. POSIX allows the
user to have more than one thread accepting signals -- sent to the 
process.
But maybe you know the answer to this question: when a _thread_ initiates
an async I/O, does it want a signal sent to the thread (pthread_kill) or
to the process?

Why not? We let the root thread register itself with the kernel asking
for raw signals. Now the root thread is not getting POSIX signals, but
it is invisible to any POSIX processes.
