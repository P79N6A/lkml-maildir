I found the bug. It's a pretty ugly race...
The problem is that although the inode->i_sem semaphore protects you
against races with ordinary writes, it does *not* protect you against
the memory management routines (such as page_launder()) from calling
writepage() on dirty pages.
For most local filesystems, this is not a problem, since they can call
vmtruncate() *before* they do their thing on the disk itself.  For
non-local filesystems, you usually can't do this, since you cannot
guarantee that the RPC call will succeed on the server.
The only solution I can see, is to force a synchronous write of those
dirty pages to the server prior to calling setattr. I've updated the
patch on
   
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/2.4.17/linux-2.4.17-fattr.dif
to do this. Fixes the race for me...
Cheers,
