Me too.  I live and breathe by them.

Me too.
An interesting thing which "the community" would appreciate is
that M$ has aggressively started to "go by the spec" as far
as SCSI is concerned.
Ding-ding!

Oh, no, no, no!  So much has changed Andre.
Just take a look at SAM, and I'm sure that you'll appreciate the object
oriented design, the abstractions, etc.  Really!
Recently all new protocols follow _explicit_ state machine definitions
at each layer they define, and how it interacts with the layer
above and below again by FSMs.  It's all a good thing.

Ok, thanks Andre.  Much appreciated.
You are the first person to back me up _publicly_.  Now if we
can find a person from "the community" to do that, and get all
the other people who've written me _privately_, we'd be in
good shape.
