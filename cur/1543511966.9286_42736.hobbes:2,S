I hate to point this out... but if the objection is to configuration
files, then what about /etc/fstab and the mount options that allow me to
mount CD-ROM drives and MS-DOS/FAT32 partitions as various users with
various permissions?
The use of a config file to determine permissions/ownership is not foreign
to the kernel or filesystems.
