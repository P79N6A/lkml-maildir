Each process needs a handle map... To avoid playing with the task structure,
fork, exec, exit, signals, etc., I used an fd attached to a proc file to keep
track of the handle map (it gives me reference counting, module tracking, and
auto-cleanup on process death).
The handle map page is just attached to the private data pointer on the struct
file. It was just convenient for starting the whole thing off.

Agreed.

I was trying to avoid using file/inode/dentry structs as much as
possible... they aren't really necessary for most of this, and are very
heavyweight.

I have thought of separating the code in to separate lumps:
  (1) An in-kernel resident lump, providing very basic services:
      * handle/handle-map management
      * object management
      * some object types
      * process death-knell notification
      * file-change notification
      * unicode string handling/conversion (steal/share from NTFS)
      * simple RPC mechanism for building certain services in userspace
      * Win32 syscall stub
      * int 0x2e stub
      * /proc view
  (2) A partial basic Win32 implementation (modulable):
      * basic Win32 syscalls, eg: CreateMutexA/W
      * _no_ GDI calls
  (3) A partial basic Native API implementation (modulable):
      * basic NT syscalls
      * again, no GDI calls
  (4) A userspace registry service, communicating with registry stubs in the
      kernel by the simple RPC mechanism.

Agreed.
The question is, how much will Linux go for?
