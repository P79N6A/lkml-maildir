Umm, no.  Counters can be resetable - you just specify that accounting
programs should not reset them, ever.
The ability to reset counters is extremely useful if you're a human
looking at the output of iptables -L -v.  (I thus far know of no one
who can memorise the counter values for around 40 rules).
