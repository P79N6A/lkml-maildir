Hi all,
I'm designing an embedded StrongARM-based system[1] that I want to use with
Linux. I need to design a keyboard/mouse interface for this beast, and
going by the kernel sources PS/2 seems the way to go (I'd really like to
use commodity hardware to talk to X and friends).
I've since found notes on how to capture a PS/2 stream with a
microcontroller, but I don't know what the best interface is to offer
Linux, ie what should the hardware look like when seen from the kernel .
I'd rather not use an 8042 ;-), but I'm open for other suggestions. The
StrongARM has an I/O space that is almost but not entirely unlike ISA, and
I have some GP I/O pins to spare. Does anyone have an idea what the best
interface would be ?
Sincerely,
Jan-Derk Bakker

 . I'd
like to release the hardware design under a GPL-like license; please
contact me off-list if you have any suggestions on the legalese that is
unavoidably involved.
