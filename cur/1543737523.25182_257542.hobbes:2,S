ISTR discussion on the mailing list about this problem,
and recently upgraded from 2.6.3 to 2.6.8.1 to hopefully
solve it, but alas the problem still exists.
Example:
# date ; ps -ef | grep ps | grep -v grep

root     29412 29351  0 14:51 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -ef
Notice the two minute difference between now and what the
process start time is.  Uptime on this box is 48 days, so
it is a gradual drift.
Any ideas on this?  Or has it been fixed since 2.6.8.1?
Phil
