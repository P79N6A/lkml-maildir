in schedule(), switch_to() macro changes esp to
the new process's stack. But, on exit frm schedule,
how come it does not get overwritten with  ebp-24,
as the dissasembled code shows. The code was compiled
without the -fomit-frame-pointer.
        pushl 508(%ecx)
        jmp __switch_to
1:      popl %ebp
        popl %edi
        popl %esi
        jmp .L1180
.L1180: 
	leal -24(%ebp),%esp
        popl %ebx
        popl %esi
        popl %edi
        movl %ebp,%esp
        popl %ebp
        ret
