A (small) fraction sounds better. We could even consider keeping track
of the number of conntracks that can be evicted (not assured), so in a
DOS situation we could save unnecessary table scans. Not sure if its
worth the effort though.
Anyway, please base your patch on the net-2.6.22 tree, which doesn't
include ip_conntrack anymore.
