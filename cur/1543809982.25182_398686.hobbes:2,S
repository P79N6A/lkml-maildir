Only if the user is foolish enough to modify the media somehow while the 
system is suspended and replace it, which is exactly how non USB disks 
currently behave.

Actually, no, it is not okay to unplug a usb disk at runtime while it is 
mounted.  It never has been and it never will be.  Also we aren't 
talking about runtime, we're talking about while the system is 
suspended, when there is no way for the kernel to know whether or not 
the device was unplugged, since it _allways_ appears to have been 
unplugged.  The alternative in the uncommon case ( where the user 
modifies the media while suspended ) does not suck any worse than it 
currently does on non usb media, and the common case ( where the user 
doesn't ) sucks worse currently with usb than others.
