Actually for this flag it looks safe because the new request shouldn't be
queued while the old one is still active (IOW there should be no simultaneous
idetape_do_request() and idetape_end_request() calls).  OTOH some other
flags (especially IDETAPE_PIPELINE_ACTIVE) looks un-safe (pileline can be
active while ->open on character device happens).
Given that this driver is currently scheduled for removal and that complete
audit/analysis would be quite costly I don't think that removing atomic bitops
from tape->flags is worth it (for pc->flags it is fine).
Could you please recast the patch accordingly?

please leave it as 'unsigned long' to match other drivers

Why not PC_FLAG_*?  [ It would match flags in ide-floppy ]

please leave it as 'unsigned long'

Why not IDETAPE_FLAG_*?
The rest of the patch looks good.
