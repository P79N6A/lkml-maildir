OK, maybe I do have my terminology wrong -- we'll call them FIFO locks
or ticket locks. The point is not to improve performance of the contended
case (although they may have slightly better contended case characteristicds),
but to improve worst case latency and improve fairness.
BTW. some advanced congestion algorithms like HBO may find these ticket
locks useful because you can see immediately how many CPUs are contending
the lock, and spinners know how many CPUs are in front of them. That info
could be fed into the spin backoff scheme.
