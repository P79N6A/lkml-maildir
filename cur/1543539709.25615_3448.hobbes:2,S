Just a wild question... Are you compiling with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS set to
yes? I get a bunch of unresolved symbols in my modules (smbfs, sound,
es1370, sb, and a few others) with this set, but oddly enough when I set
it to N everything loads and runs just fine.
Not sure whether I'm just not clearing files out right on a
recompile or if it's consistent yet.
