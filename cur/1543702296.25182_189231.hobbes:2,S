Hi,
I get plenty of this in my logs:
i2c_adapter i2c-0: Bus collision! SMBus may be locked until next hard
reset. (sorry!)
Kernel 2.6.0 with lm-sensors 2.8.2.
I get very weird results, especially on the fan, but others as well.
Here are three runs of sensors:

It works fine with MBM in Windows. Well, MBM is having some troubles
with the temperature (it gets lower and lower as time pass, and ends on
about 8-9 degrees celsius. But fan and temperatures are read just fine,
never any glitch. On thing thing though, the Vcore2 is 1,70. The Bios
reports it correctly, but both MBM and LM-sensors says 1,50. Have no
idea why. The 1,50 is static, never changes, while VCore1 (which ideally
should be 1,75) varies from 1,75 to 1,79. In the BIOS both seem sane,
and varies with 3-4 degrees.
I guess all these problems are because of the bus collision, which I
have read usually happens because of bad boards. Which I admit that I do
have, but it works in Windows :(
What are the most common reasons for the bus collisions, and is there
anything to do?
Best regards,
Stian
