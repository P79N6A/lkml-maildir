Subject: Linux not detecting ide0

I discovered some weird behavior in IDE interface handling.
I some cases linux detects the ide1 channel , but not ide0.
More precisely , it prints a line like :
ide0: BM-DMA xxxxxx
but that is it. Nothing else. No line of :
ide0:  at 0x0170 blah blah 
no drives on the channel are recognized.
No ide0 entry in /proc/devices 
etc.
ide1 and the devices on it are more or less OK. ( I didn't notice
any problems, but it is hard to test if linux does not see the root
fs on hda ! )
I tested the redhat kernel-2.4.7-10 and vanilla linux 2.4.9.
Hardware details :
- MSI K7T Pro2A motherboard , BIOS v2.9 , VIA KT133 chipset, via 686b southbridge
- hda is an IBM Deskstar 75GXP 45 GB hard drive ( DTLA-307045 ) ( 80-wire cable,
    cable-select , connected to the end of the cable, thus master )
- hdb : none
- hdc : Acer 1208A CD-RW drive ( cable select (master))
- hdd : Teac CD532E-B CD-ROM ( cable select (slave))    80-wire cable
The way to trigger this is to set one of the IDE devices in BIOS to wrong geometry.
Maybe it is a BIOS bug.
I some cases I also got a weird line from linux :
hd1: C/H/S=0/0/0 from BIOS ignored
I thought that disk are enumerated by letter only, not numbers.
( it is H-D-one , not H-D-ell, in case you have a funny font )
