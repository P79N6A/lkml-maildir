There are very little hooks... But we may want to make sure we have
same userland interface. swsusp uses "echo 3:5 > /sys/power/resume" to
trigger resume from device major 3 minor 5.

Hmm, bitmaps? Okay, then low-level code needs to stay separate. (And
thats bad, I wanted that one to be shared most).
