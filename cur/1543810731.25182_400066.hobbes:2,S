That patch adds lots of unused code so far now a clear NACK.  Even after
users are in mainline such additions would need a clear justification.
Can for example some existing locking code be removed?  fs/locks.c is
a huge mess right now and adding more and more entry points doesn't
exactly help there.
Oh, and given that's it's stuff deeply interwinded with the file locking
code it should become _GPL exports.
