You are moving it inside function that should have no business doing
this... Would something like this work better? [hand-edited, apply by
hand; untested].
BTW is bootsplash actually used by suse and/or redhat? Suse certainly
has some splashscreen... Perhaps some splash support into swsusp (as
an add on) would be good idea, but it would be good to only code it
once.
