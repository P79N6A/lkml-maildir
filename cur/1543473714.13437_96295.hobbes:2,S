Hi Andrea,
	I added your patch to test1-2.2.0-pre2, and your patch does not appear
to work, becuase the page cache grows too large and swaps out too many
things.
At bootup:
telomere:~> cat free1
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:         63476      25684      37792      18108       1476     
15376
-/+ buffers/cache:       8832      54644
Swap:        34236          0      34236
After running netscape:
telomere:~> cat free2
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:         63476      48352      15124      30592       1796

Swap:        34236          0      34236
After running 'wc /usr/bin/*'
telomere:~> cat free3
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:         63476      61100       2376      10464       1064

Without your patch, running 'wc /usr/bin/*' swaps out only about 220k.
So perhaps your change to 'count' in filemap.c was incorrect?
