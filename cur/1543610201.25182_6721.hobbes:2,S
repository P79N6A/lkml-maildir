Something is wrong with my head, it looks. Well, the simplest way to get
it working is 
chattr -SAadiscu /dev
rm /dev/console
mknod /dev/console c 5 1
chmod 700 /dev/console
this way /dev/console will be recreated and attributes of parent
directory "/dev" will be inherited.

Yes, but Hans thinks we shouldn't do ACL reiserfs 3.x and concentrate on
v4 in stead. You can try to persuade him though. Same for extended
attributes.
