It's actually not all that simple. Some CPUs do have direct inb/outb
instructions that are not syscalls. So you either have to single-step
all the program and look at it's execution path, or you'd run it as a
notmal user and handle the privilege penetration then luser starts
inb'ing:) A coworker of me has done that with a DOS driver, doing such
IO tracing for the dosemu it was running it.
Maybe he cares to explain it in detail...
