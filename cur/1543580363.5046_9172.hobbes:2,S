I've been playing with the 2.4.0 kernel scince you gave me the patch for
the alphas...  
What I have found is that it tends to randomly hang...
No Panic, no OOPs, no nothing...
The machine is a PC164, Which falls under the EB164 class.
It exhibits this behaviour on both the "generic" and "eb164" cpu types
{compile option}  It doesn't even boot compiled as pc164..
I'm also seeing this problem on my A/S 4100, "Rawhide"..
My current working kernel is 2.2.18, and I am going to start playing with
the 2.4.1
Sometimes it hangs on boot {while loading network daemons} and sometimes
it will boot fine, and I will be doing a compile or something and it will
just hang...
What kind of info can I send you to help troubleshoot this more?
