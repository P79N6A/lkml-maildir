To share interrupts requires that the interrupting device
generate a level instead of an edge. The parallel ports
that exist in "super I/O chips" and in bare boards, produce
edges. If you have a special parallel port in a PCI slot, it
should generate levels because the PCI specification demands
that it does.
Since IRQ7 (the dedicated, edge, ISA parallel port interrupt)
should never go to any PCI slot, I don't see how it could
ever report using that. Perhaps it's a bug or the BIOS allowed
it to be configured that way (remove IRQ7 from the PCI bus).
This should make something else show up on the PCI bus.
Move the board to another slot and see if the shared problem
still remains.
The driver should be smart enough to know that if the interrupt
was obtained from the PCI bus, then it can allocate it shared.
Cheers,
