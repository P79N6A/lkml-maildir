How does the file manager / chooser decide whether you're trying to move 
into a directory, or the meta-data-directory for a directory?
It's not just files that should have metadata - directories need* them 
too.  Making it possible to see attributes as a directory under a file 
is great, but you'd still need an O_META flag for accessing directory 
metadata (since there are already files under a directory).

MacOS does, Be did (sort of).  I'm not sure it would be the end of the 
world, as long as the data can be extracted.

That would depend on the other system.  Data is easy, metadata is hard.
It would be possible to create an XML schema for metadata, and if 
requested (O_EVERYTHING?), the file data is returned with all metadata 
in XML tags.  (not advocating this, just an idea :)
