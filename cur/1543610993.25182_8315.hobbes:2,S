Can you provide the output provided by the agp module at load time, please?
This mini-patch of mine should indeed be technically sufficient. Of course I
will provide a "real-world" patch working for all i830 agp-chipsets (M or MG)
as soon as it is clear, that the detection still works.
I am a bit bothered by your X setup. Can you stabilize this somehow? Maybe
using some known-to-work (older) X version for your graphics card.
It looks solvable.
Regards,
Stephan
