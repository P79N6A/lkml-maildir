Hi, Auke
 It looks like the reason for reboot failure is unability of BIOS to reboot if network pci device
is in D3 state. Once I've added 
 	pci_set_power_state(pdev, PCI_D0);
as a last line to e1000_shutdown() method, board started rebooting again.
Moreover, here is what I found in release notes to the latest BIOS (from October 5, 2006):
"Fixed an issue where system not able to shutdown to S5 if the LAN is set to D3 mode."
This may have affected reboot with LAN in D3 negatively.
  I guess you are in the best position of all of us to bring the issue to Intel BIOS team. 
Aleks.
