I've now had a crash when running 2.2.10 plus the AIC7XXX patches from 
http://www.redhat.com/~dledford/aic7xxx.html
Unfortunately the stack trace was so long on this occasion that all the 
details were scrolled off the screen and so I can't report them here. (In none 
of these crashes have the messages gone to the logs).
How am I supposed to report OOPSes in this situation?
Thanks,
Richard.
