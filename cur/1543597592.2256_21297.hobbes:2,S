2 things:
1: there is a project in the kernel to establish API references.
you should not duplicate this work, but should add to it.
Reason: There is no way you can get or stay ahead.
2: the secondary issue of documenting best practices in the
kernel is a different matter altogether. I, myself, have started
a project to do this. I'm sorta scared of letting people know
about it at this point, but I feel it is necessary.
the entry point is:
http://bama.ua.edu/~dunn001/journeyman/
I /am/ looking for help, but it is very early. I am NOT looking
for exposure, so dont even bother looking if you dont want to write
docs; there isnt anything there for you.
