Paul Robinson,
        Solaris's SunOS SVR4.x has a modular schedular / dispatcher,
        however, I believe that the time share dispatcher is
        actually a frozen-base and is not replaceable. I do
        believe that some of its scheduling characteristics are
        modifyable.
        IT is my understanding that CFS is the new schedular,
        however it is separated from the RT (real-time) FIFO and
        RR schedular.
        Currently, I have a initial suggestion to lkma to see if
        their is any support of a interactive task class. It allows
        a root user to classify a set of tasks as interactive.
        If their is acceptance, I plan to propose a patch/ set of 
        changes to support this new task class by the end of Aug.
        IFF, then maybe in the future...
        Paul Robinson, if you feel that you are up to the task
        of modularizing the schedular / dispatcher to do what
        you think should be done, I would suggest submitting
        a prototype to Ingo, et al and see what the response
        is..
