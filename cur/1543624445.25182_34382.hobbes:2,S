This is S3/S4 support. Not used during normal operation. S3/S4 without this
is as dangerous as "oops, we've written wrong data to wrong place, without
even knowing that". With this, the problem is "maybe your hdd is not initialized
properly, so you lost ability to talk to it".

It will not. This is only used when ACPI suspend-to-disk/suspend-to-ram
is used (and at that time, you have worse problems than IDE driver).
