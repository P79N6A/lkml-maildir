A better thing would be to use getuid - it turns into just a return with a
memory dereference). I ran it on my 3.06GHz P4 (HT, but only UP kernel),
PREEMPT, HZ=1000...

I used the rdtsc instruction to measure the time for the getuid syscall (see
bellow for source to the test app).
---8<-------------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
/* CPU speed in MHz */
#define CPUFREQ 3060
#define rdtscll(val) \
      __asm__ __volatile__("rdtsc" : "=A" (val))
int main()
{
	unsigned long long start, end;
	int i;
	for(i=0;i<10000;i++) {
		rdtscll(start);
		getuid();
		rdtscll(end);
		printf("delta for syscall: %llu cycles = %f us\n", end-start, (end-start)/(float)CPUFREQ);
	}
	return 0;
}
