Thanks for the re-assurance.

I'm pretty sure that it's triggered by some earlier problem, most 
likely reaching a threads-per-process limit (or an associated total VM 
per process limit due to large default thread stack sizes).  There's a 
good chance that I will find and fix that problem, and this one will 
then go away unsolved...

Unfortunately, it happens on the production machine but I've not been 
able to reproduce it otherwise.  I'll keep trying.  FWIW my assumption 
is that the ERESTARTSYS comes from the sock_intr_errno() call from inet_csk_wait_for_connect().
Thanks,  Phil.
