I am convinced that all these games are unnecessary, and that the problem
is fundamentally different. Not fixing up the current code, but just
looking at the problem differently - making the deadlock go away by virtue
of avoiding the critical regions.
I think the suggestion to change the semantics of "swapout" is a good one.
Now we have the mm layer passing down the vma to the IO layer, and hat
makes everything more complex. I would certainly agree with just changing
that semantic detail, and changing swapout to something like
	.. hold a spinlock - we can probably just reuse the
	   page_table_lock for this to avoid multiple levels of locking
	   here..
	file = fget(vma->vm_file);
	offset = file->f_offset + (address - vma->vm_start);
	flush_tlb_page(vma, address);
	spin_unlock(&vma->vm_mm->page_table_lock);
	error = file->f_ops->swapout(file, offset, page);
	fput(file);
	...
and then the other requirement would be that whenever the vma chain is
physically modified, you also have to hold the page_table_lock. 
And finally, we rename the "page_table_lock" to the "page_stealer_lock",
and we're all done.
Does anybody see anything fundamentally wrong here? It looks like it
should fix the problem without introducing any new locks, and without
holding any locks across the actual physical swapout activity.
