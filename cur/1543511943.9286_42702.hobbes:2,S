Here are user addresses.......
int global;
main()
{
    int local;
    printf("main() at %p\n", main);
    printf("Global data at %p\n", &global);
    printf("Local data at %p\n", &local);
}
main() at 0x8048488
Global data at 0x8049620
Local data at 0xbffff794
You could also look at _init, __libc_init_first, _start, _etext, _edata,
__bss_start. They are all global. Very few programs are executed without
using the 'C' runtime library so these are most informative.
If, at the user-level, the user has to know where the code executes,
the code is broken by definition.
Cheers,
