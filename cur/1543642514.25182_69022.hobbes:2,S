First BACK up what is left.
Next dig out smartsuite from 
http://www.linux-ide.org/smart.html
Run it in full capture mode, please use another disk to run root, or the
system will tank.
Read and save smart logs.
cat /dev/zero > /dev/hd{IBM-DTLA-307060}x
Rerun Smart in full capture mode.
Reread smart logs and compare.
cat /dev/urandom > /dev/hd{IBM-DTLA-307060}x
If you get no errors you can reuse the drive, for how long? Maybe 6 months
to a year.
Now, I can not tell you what, why, how things are going on.
Sheesh, I expect to be in a deep six for this series of events already.
Sorry, I can not say anymore.
If you do not like the above, you need to run out and buy another drive
fast.
Cheers,
