Ohh, then there's another problem. Note that try_to_swap_out() currently
does
        if (PageReserved(page)
            || PageLocked(page)
            || (zone && (!memclass(page->zone, zone))))
                goto out_failed;
kswapd passes in a zone = 0 argument. 
This (and all similar places) will need to be changed to
        if (PageReserved(page)
            || PageLocked(page)
            || (zone && (!memclass(page->zone, zone)))
            || ((zone == 0) && PageHighMem(page)))
Either that, or we should teach kswapd about zones, then kswapd can
pass in the zone pointer it is trying to get balanced. For 2.3, kswapd
will not pass in the highmem zone pointer. That would also mean that
Andrea's patch below will not be needed.
I will create a zone-aware kswapd patch, built on top of the one I
already put out, and send that out asap.
