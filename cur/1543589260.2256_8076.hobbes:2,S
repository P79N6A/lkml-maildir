Right. Now there is some time where "extreme thrashing" will alert ME
(a human, I think) to try and find/kill the offending process.
Otherwise I have to trust Rik's OOM killer. Now his OOM killer isn't
all that bad. But it isn't human. Humans are better at actually
finding the real CAUSE. An OOM killer might hit one or two innocent
processes along the way. So far I've killed the right process ALL the
time. I can't say the same for the OOM killer.
