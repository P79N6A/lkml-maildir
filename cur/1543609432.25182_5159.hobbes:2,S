Subject: [PATCH] VIA timer fix was removed?

Hello.
The following patch (introduced by Vojtech Pavlik some time ago) was
removed somewhere between 2.4.14 and 2.4.15-pre3.
Without it, the timer counter is reset to a wrong value and
gettimeofday() starts to return strange values.
Nothing aboutit is mentioned in the changelog, so I suppose it wasn't
supposed to be removed?
J.
