There is a school of thought that claims the two are one and the same,  
*and* that technical merit is *not* "quantifiable and objective" *in  
general* (though it's certainly possible to measure the performance of a  
solution, all measures of maintainability I have ever heard about were  
deeply flawed, for example). And of course there's nothing that says  
aesthetics can't cover performance.
I certainly subscribe to that view. It seems that Linus and the other core  
kernel hackers also do.

And what is that supposed to achieve?
*Linus* already understands the benefits.
(In fact, if there's any specific technical direction Linus has been known  
for, it's pushing the importance of latency over throughput! Anyone  
remember the network latency discussions, for example? Or the *many*  
interactive performance debates?)

The main (not only) problem is identifying those secure points. (There's  
also the problem that a long-running code path may not *have* a secure  
point somewhere in the middle. At which time you *have* to think about  
changing your algorithm anyway.)
Mostly, this is something that can be solved incrementally much better  
than in one single brute-force approach.
The way I understand it, Ingo's patch is essentially one such brute-force  
approach. It's one way of finding most problem spots fairly quickly, but  
(1) the individual solutions probably are sub-optimal in many cases, and  
(2) it is not even clear that all of them are actually necessary. I know  
from experience that this type of fix often has the problem that you fix  
where you think is the problem, then see another problem that was  
invisible before, but fixing *only* that other problem might have fixed  
your first problem, too - and unless you explicitely test for this, you  
won't know.
So: IMAO, the right way is (1) fix those areas where you can see that  
there is obviously a local problem (because you'll never find a way  
without doing that anyway), (2) retest to find what problem spots are  
left, (3) *study* those places, (4) experiment with various solutions to  
find the best, (5) lather, rinse, repeat, (6) decide to abort when there  
is no more good solution to be found.
This is not a fast algorithm. It is, however, IMAO a necessary one.
Also, it seems to be the algorithm Linus has already decided on.

Applications for which latency is critical include nearly all interactive  
applications. Linus has known this for a very long time, as anyone  
following l-k cannot help but notice.

They have so far.

You seem to think there is some kind of conflict. I think both of these  
are necessary for the other.
