Subject: LARGE bug with 2.4.1ac10 and loop filesystem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

        I think I hit a bug introduced between 2.4.1ac9 and 2.4.1ac10,
and a
really bad one I belive :(.
Bug description:
        Distribution: Linux Mandrake 7.2
        Machine Dual PIII-950, Asus CUBX-E motheboard, 256MB RAM
        Compiler (kgcc -v):Reading specs from
/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-mandrake-linux/egcs-2.91.66/specs
                        gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314/Linux
(egcs-1.1.2 release)
        Filesystem "loop" compiled as module, filesystem "iso9660" and
juliet
extension compiled in kernel.
        Symptom: When trying to: mount blah.iso /mnt/cdrom -o loop, the
console
hangs, Ctrl-C can not interrupt the command, kill can not kill the
stalled mount process and while rebooting none of the filesystems are
unmounted cleanly ( it squirts messeages like umount2: / is busy,
umount2: /home is busy, etc) and on restart the filesystems are checked
but fortunately no errors are found.
        By greping the patch I see that some interlocks were added on
the loop
filesystem but I have no knowledge of the intricate mechanism of the
filesystem to correct the problem :(.
        Kernel 2.4.1ac9 works OK from that point of view.
        Please advise me how can I help with debugging of that further.
                Thank you,
                Mircea C.
