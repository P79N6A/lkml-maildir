After a bit of time using this new sound card I noticed that after every 
song/sound played regardless of type (MP3, MOD, MIDI, WAV, etc)  I get a dma 
timed out message.  "es1371: dma timed out??" is now seen through-out my log 
files.  I was wondering if anyone else was having a similar experience with 
cards with this chipset or is it just Creative Ensoniq 128.
