Ok, let's try just stripping the "const" out of the min/max macros, and
see what complains. What the code _really_ wants to do is to just compare
two types for being basically equal, and in real life what Linux really
would prefer is to have "types" as first-class citizens and being able to
compare them directly instead of playing games. And we may end up having
that as a preprocessor phase (ie I might add it to the semantic parse
thing).
