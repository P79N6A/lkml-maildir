Another alternative might be to define an intermediate version of
timer_list that avoids adding new macros, like
struct timer_list {
	struct list_head entry;
­	unsigned long expires;
­	void (*function)(union { unsigned long l; void *p; }
				 __attribute__((transparent_union)));
­	union {
		unsigned long data __deprecated;
		void *obj;
	};
­	struct tvec_t_base_s *base;
};
Unfortunately, this relies more on gcc specific behavior than we
may want, and it makes it possible to abuse in new ways, like defining
a function to take an unsigned long argument, but passing the data
as void *obj.
