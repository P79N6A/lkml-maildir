I'm not convinced this one is needed. An irq can still run on another
cpu but the cli();sti() may execute while it's here:
	irq running		synchronize_irq()
	--------------		-----------------
	do_IRQ
	handle_IRQ_event
				cli()
				sti()
	irq_enter -> way too late
in short, doing irqs_running() doesn't seem to weaken the semantics of
synchronize_irq() to me.
I think it should be changed this way instead:
void synchronize_irq(void)
{
	smp_mb();
	if (irqs_running()) {
		/* Stupid approach */
		cli();
		sti();
	}
}
to be sure to read the local irq area after the previous code (the
test_and_set_bit of the global_irq_lock of a cli() in your version would
achieve the same implicit smp_mb too, so maybe your only point for doing
cli()/sti() was to execute the smp_mb before the irqs_running?).  the
above version is more finegrined and it looks equivalent to yours.
