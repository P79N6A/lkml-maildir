Hi,
Just a quick note to report that my system does not run
stably under 2.4.23-pre5 where pre4 worked fine.  The
system locks up usually during the execution of the rc
scripts.  It's gotten fully booted a couple times but never
lasts longer than 5 minutes.  When the lockup occurs, there
is no oops, panic, or the like, system just stops
responding.
The system is an Intel sds2 mainboard in a dual Pentium III
configuration with acpi enabled.  If you need any other
information, lspci, dmesg, etc.  Let me know.
