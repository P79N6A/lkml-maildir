No, it's not gone away - but it's taking longer to show up.
I can try and put together a test loop that does work, hibernates, resumes and 
repeats but since I know it crashes at some point there doesn't seem much point 
unless I'm looking for something.
There's not much in the logs - is there any other instrumentation that people 
could suggest?
DaveC, given this is happening without (obvious) libata errors do you think it 
may be something in the XFS/md/hibernate area?
If there's anything to be tried then I'll also move to 2.6.22-rc6.

There is an obvious problem there though Tejun (the errors even when sda isn't 
involved in the OS boot) - can I start another thread about that issue/bug 
later? I need to reshuffle partitions so I'd rather get the hibernate working 
first and then go back to it if that's OK?
