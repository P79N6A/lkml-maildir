Then I can only suggest that you run through the bitkeeper repository
(see 
http://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.4
) and do a binary search
applying the patches between 2.4.23-pre3 and 2.4.23-pre4 until you
find the guilty party.
Should be fairly easy, as there only appears to be one SCSI related
changeset (which only adds one line to a blacklist) and no IDE or
IRQ-related changes at all...
Cheers,
