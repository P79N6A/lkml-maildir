Hey, and if you think that is fun, just try compiling it in
(CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST=y) and then build rcutorture.c as an
external module, then insmod'ing it!  You get two torture tests
running concurrently.  I found this out the hard way while
learning how the "tristate" directive works.

Well, I submitted -that- patch a couple of weeks ago, and it was
roundly denounced for /proc pollution, hence the shiny new modules
implementation of it.
I must admit I was rather negative on the idea of using modules
for this sort of thing, but after actually trying it, I found that
it really works quite nicely.  The module loader even parses all
your arguments for you, so you can very easily parameterize the
tests.
						Thanx, Paul
