gcc version dependent.  Older versions of gcc put all uninitialized
global variables into .bss, even if there was an attribute like
__initdata that tried to use a different section.  So we got into the
habit of '__initdata variables must be explicitly initialized'.  Some
platforms are using old versions of gcc where that restriction may
still apply.
