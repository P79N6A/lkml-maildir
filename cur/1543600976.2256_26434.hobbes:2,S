Ok, guys, since we know that Athlon bug is BIOS version dependent,
please do this:
* Flash 'bad' BIOS (one that makes Atlon-optimized kernel to oops)
* Reboot
* Save complete output of lspci -vvvxxx
* Flash 'good' BIOS
* Reboot
* Save complete output of lspci -vvvxxx
* Send me those captured outputs. Include BIOS versions pls.
Note: you don't need to boot with Athlon-optimized kernel.
I just want to compare what's the difference in chipset
programming with 'bad' and 'good' BIOS.
If you feel so inclined, do the comparison yourself
and report.
Does anybody have KT133A data sheet handy to look up
those PCI config register dumps?
