According to the documentation I've been reading, you set
up your computer for DHCP! It will automatically use one
of those free 192.x.x.x addresses to start if you
don't already have an ISP connection. Otherwise, you
leave your current configuration alone and the ppp link
will work as a remote system.
In no case should an IP address be 255.255.255.255.
