See the "Handbook of Mathematical Functions" by Abromawitz and Stegun, 
Dover Publications (ISBN 486-61272-2, Library of Congress number 
65-12253) which has some small but accurate polynomial approximations 
for many functions.  I have used these successfully with fixed point 
rational numbers (FDRN) (which are probably the same as your scaled 
longs) using 64 bit integers and the results were generally accurate to 
the least significant bit when compared to values calculated using the 
normal maths library and converted to FDRN representation.
Of course, the available range of values is smaller than for floats or 
double and you have to be careful w.r.t. overflow etc.
