A comprehensive way to do this sort of thing is to rename the field.  We
have >500 references, so one would do:
struct inode {
	...
	union {
		unsigned int i_nlink;
		unsigned int i_nlink_use_the_accessors_please;
	}
	...
};
then, when everything in-tree is migrated, remove `i_nlink'.
It's a bit of a hassle, but it will give the most reliable result for both
in-tree and out-of-tree filesystems.
