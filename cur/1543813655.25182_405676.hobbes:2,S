This has been discussed on LKML recently, it's not 2.6.16 material
because it might break working setups when the previously disabled
device becomes the default sound card.  Of course the same setup would
have broken if we added a driver for a previously unsupported soundcard,
so I'm not sure how this fits in with the "don't break userspace" rule.
IMHO it should be merged post 2.6.16.
