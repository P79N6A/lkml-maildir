Well, the argument I have against mentioning caches is that cache 
coherency order is _not_ the only thing that is relevant. As already 
mentioned, data speculation can cause exactly the same "non-causal" effect 
as cache update ordering, so from a _conceptual_ standpoint, the cache is 
really just one implementation detail in the much bigger picture of 
buffering and speculative work re-ordering operations...
So it might be a good idea to first explain the memory barriers in a more 
abstract sense without talking about what exactly goes on, and then have 
the section that gives _examples_ of what the CPU actually is doing that 
causes these barriers to be needed. And make it clear that the examples 
are just that - examples.
