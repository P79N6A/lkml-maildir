There's a simple but important fix in net/ipv4/tcp.c:tcp_write_space
where the call to sock_wake_async has been changed to sk_wake_async.
Since sock_wake_async does not contain the call to the event dispatch code,
it's easier to flush the Alan's patch queue than to receive POLLOUTs.
I fixed it at the end of July but I think I screwed up thing in my /patch folder.
The new patch is here :
