Just put initrd_read(), initrd_release() and initrd_fops back and
switch file->f_op on rd_open() as it was in -pre10.  Maybe you
want to replace blkdev_put(inode->i_bdev, BDEV_FILE) in initrd_release()
with blkdev_close(inode, file), but that will be the same pretty soon.
It's really the simplest way to deal with that and it has a benefit
of being both straightforward and well-tested.
