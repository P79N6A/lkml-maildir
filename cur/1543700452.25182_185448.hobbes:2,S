fasync_helper != kill_fasync
fasync_helper is rare, and usually running under lock_kernel().
kill_fasync is far more common (every pipe_read and _write), I want to 
remove the unconditional read_lock(&global_lock).

Today's solution is two copies of fasync_helper: one with lock_sock in 
net/socket.c, one with write_lock_irq(&fasync_lock) in fs/fcntl.c.
Perhaps just a "if (*fp == NULL) return;" before grabbing the read_lock 
in kill_fasync, without touching fasync_helper - that would be 
sufficient to fix pipe_read and _write.
