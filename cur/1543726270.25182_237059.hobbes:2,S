Subject: [PATCH 2.6.8-rc2] intel8x0.c to include CK804 audio support

I left out support for two other NVIDIA audio controllers in my previous
patch.
Attached is a patch which adds audio support for MCP04 and MCP2S audio
controllers for the intel8x0 audio driver.  This patch is to be applied
on top of the one I had previously submitted (so in total, there should
be CK804, MCP04, and MCP2S added to the intel8x0 driver as of
2.6.8-rc2).
