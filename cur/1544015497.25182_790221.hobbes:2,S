so you mean a0e280e0f33f6c859a235fb69a875ed8f3420388 seems good, while the 
next step in Linus's tree, 52fefcec97c25b15887e6a9a885ca54e7f7c0928 is 
already broken?
Does 52fefcec97c25b15887e6a9a885ca54e7f7c0928 start working if you do:
  git checkout 52fefcec97c25b15887e6a9a885ca54e7f7c0928
  git revert a0e280e0f33f6c859a235fb69a875ed8f3420388
?
That would implicate a0e280e0f33f6c859a235fb69a875ed8f3420388 + some 
layout/timing problem - which does not trigger for some reason if pure 
a0e280e0f33f6c859a235fb69a875ed8f3420388 is tried.
