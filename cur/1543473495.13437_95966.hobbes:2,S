Not to mention usually, and I believe in the case of Linux, major versioning
is layed out ahead of time, with certain goals in mind.  i.e. the 2.2
kernels have a certain goal-set, the 3.0 kernels have a certain goal set.
Making the versioning "sound" more impressive isn't the goal here.  The goal
is to create an organized, stable OS kernel.  Than means making a roadmap
and sticking to it.
My 2 cents, anyway (c:
