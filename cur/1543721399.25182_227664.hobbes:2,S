Well, it just so happens that I have two .config files, both listing
CONFIG_JFS_FS=m, and without the patch, exactly one of them fails
compilation (on the same cluster, distcc gcc 3.4.0).  That is why
I assumed the include was missing -- the moving of the declaration
in my patch was only meant as an extra clean up for bonus points.
