You might as well rip out C++ style function prototypes and void.
Face it, C has evolved. The ISO even requires the nice comment style.
I think you can make gcc 2.7.0 accept the nice comments. You can hack
the spec file or add a command argument.
C evolved from languages that used // for comments. Now they return.
Yay! The /* comments were a bad joke designed to make IBM terminal
drivers puke... well, at least they did.
I suggest you write a patch to remove the old /* comments. :-)
