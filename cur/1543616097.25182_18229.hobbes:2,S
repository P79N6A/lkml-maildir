this is the latest update of the O(1) scheduler:

now that Linus has put the -D2 patch into the 2.5.2-pre10 kernel, the
2.5.2-pre10-E1 patch has become quite small :-)
The patch compiles, boots & works just fine on my UP/SMP boxes.
Changes since -D2:
 - make rq->bitmap big-endian safe. (Anton Blanchard)
 - documented and cleaned up the load estimator bits, no functional
   changes apart from small speedups.
 - do init_idle() before starting up the init thread, this removes a race
   where we'd run the init thread on CPU#0 before init_idle() has been
   called.
