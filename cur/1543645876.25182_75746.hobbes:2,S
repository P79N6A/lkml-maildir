Quite a few people seem to stumble over the new input layer options.
It's non-obvious to quite a few people that serial i/o is anything to
do with their keyboard. Likewise i8042 doesn't ring 'keyboard' noises
in most peoples heads.
IMO, the input layer options need simplification, or at least
a sensible set of defaults.
