I've grown fond of using pipes as a way
to break out of select loops, but that doesn't work
with SIGIO yet in 2.4.  A nice patch was posted a year ago,
and again a few months ago; you can pick it up here:

It's in 2.5 already.
It'd really be nice if this were integrated into the 2.4 kernel.
Any reason not to do it for 2.4.20?
Without this, my nifty Poller library that makes SIGIO 
usable is kinda broken (the wakeUp function relies on
writing a byte to a pipe). 
Thanks,
Dan
