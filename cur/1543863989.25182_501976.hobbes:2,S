Robert Love's preemption patches that turned the kernel into a
preemptible kernel made it in back in 2.5.
I guess you are talking about Ingo Molnar's -rt patch.  Parts of it has
made it into upstream. For example, the priority inheritance of futexes,
as well as robust mutexes. As well as some of Thomas Gleixner's hrtimer
code.
The rest is still maintained at the usual place
(

).
As for that going into mainline?  Well that's still on the drawing
board ;)
