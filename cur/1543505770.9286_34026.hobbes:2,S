I was running multi IO test for about two hours and system panic.  Most
panic messages were scrolled up and only left some could be meaningful in
some way:
Code 8b 40 08 83 f9 ff 0f 84 ab 00 00 00 89 c8 83 e0 7f 8b 1c 85
Aiee, killing interrupt handler
Kernel panicL Attenpted to kill the idle task!
In interrupt handler -not syncing
Then system hung.  No message was logged due to the system has to be
rebooted.
Could anyone has experienced this message have  good guess what could cause
the problem?
Thanks!
