Andreas,
Journalling slows everything down because it requires all writes (and reads)
to be serialized.  This decreases SMP parallelism.  The last thing Linux
needs is another slow SMP poor component.  I think more is better, don't get
me wrong.  I jsut didn't like seeing some folks go belly up and start
killing their internal projects (like ext3) just becuase XFS shows up on the
scene.  Particularly since it was a patently blatant predatory move by SGI
based on pure politics -- so obvious.  It's also just another unix file
system, and comes with all the limitations of Unix FS's.
Jeff
