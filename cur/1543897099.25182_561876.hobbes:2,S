the primary goal is to pass a random value to userspace at process
start; this to save glibc from having to open /dev/urandom on ever
program start (which it does now for all apps compiled with
-fstack-protector, which in various distros is "everything").

and this is because Alexander wants 2 and not 1 random int to be passed
for his own glibc proposed change (combined with get_random_int() being
designed for only 4 bytes per process ;-)
