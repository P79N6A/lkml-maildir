yups and on HT it's 2000 NMI on one physical processor
I think to something like this, it's just a quick draw so you get the
idea. it's the less bad patch I can provide, get a look at the apic.c
chunk, I needed to remove the check_nmi_watchdog(); test for UP else
this test will complete in 10 seconds. Look like ugly but anyway on
SMP and with nmi_watchdog=2 we never call check_nmi_watchdog() and
I think the purpose of check_nmi_watchdog() is to test IO apic not
local apic after all if a local apic is up it must be sane ?
