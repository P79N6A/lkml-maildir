Ah, gotcha. Not sure off hand of any resource.
My x86info program has them documented in source form..
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/davej/x86info/
I'll extrapolate those into a human readable table, and put
it on my webpage sometime..  I've been meaning to put up
x86info dumps from various cpu's on there actually.
(I'll take this opportunity to ask anyone with a few spare
minutes to send -a output to me (NOT to linux-kernel btw))

If you want to look at that source, its in AMD/identify.c
The last released version isn't aware of MP/XP's, but has the
earlier models covered.
regards,
Dave.
