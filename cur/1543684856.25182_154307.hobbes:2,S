I hate to rain on your parade, but for a platform that has so many
companies paying people full time to maintain under Linux having it
take this long is a big diasppointment for me :(
I do sparc64 as a hobby in my spare time, as a single individual, and
it has been working daily throughout the entire 2.4.x and 2.5.x
series.
The fact that there are still "external patches for performance"
is even more disheartening.
My tree never lags Linus's by more than 24 or 48 hours, unless one
of us is on vacation and not near computers.  And if I can do this
in my spare time, it should be doable by people getting paid full
time to maintain the ia64 port, don't you think? 8-)
