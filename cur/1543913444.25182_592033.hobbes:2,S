Mathieu,
>> # CONFIG_INET_LRO is not set
The in-kernel driver now depends on CONFIG_INET_LRO.
The kconfig needs to be changed to reflect this, and we will submit a patch.
In the meantime, you could alternatively use the Myri10GE 1.3.1 driver 
from the download page:

Feel free to contact us if you have additional questions.
