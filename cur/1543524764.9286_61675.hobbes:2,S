I'm pleased to announce the first public release of SUBTERFUGUE.  Below is a
brief description from the README.
--Mike
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is SUBTERFUGUE, version 0.0 ("slaughter").
SUBTERFUGUE is a framework for observing and playing with the reality of
software; it's a foundation for building tools to do tracing, sandboxing, and
many other things. You could think of it as "strace meets expect."
Here's a short (real) "screenshot" which hints at one of its possible uses:
    # sf --trick=SimplePathSandbox:"read=['/'];write=['/dev/tty'];net=1" bash
    # id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
    # rm -f /etc/passwd
    write deny (unlink): '/etc/passwd'
    rm: cannot unlink `/etc/passwd': Permission denied
BEWARE: This is a pre-alpha release.  It might not hose your system, but who
can say?  You probably shouldn't even be reading this.  Don't run this as root
(yet).  Don't use it to run programs where a loss of state might be disastrous
(e.g., fetchmail).  Consider yourself warned.
