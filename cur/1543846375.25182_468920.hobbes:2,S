The low level text engine used by xmon (and my some early console/debug
stuff on powerpc as well) really doesn't have any link to fbcon... doing
that would be hard and ugly and take the risk of making it fragile,
which isn't what we want to do... usually, when you fall into xmon, you
don't care about your console cursor :) (In fact, that stuff can even
blast on top of X if the later has the UseFBDev option).
