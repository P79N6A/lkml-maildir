my workstation is pentium with 2.2.X kernel runing X and using NFS
filesytems mounted from our server. crashes occured to my when working
under Xes but i'm not sure whether it is related to NFS while i was not
doing anything with NFS fs when crash occurs. but maybe it is enought to
done something with NFS fs few minutes/hours/... ago to trigger crash?
