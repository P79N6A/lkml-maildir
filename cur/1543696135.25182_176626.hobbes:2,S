I also notice this on 2.6.0-test9-mm1 (haven't tried -mm2 yet). If I increase
the sensitivity in GNOME 2.4, it feels 'shaky' (it jumps around a bit when
moving it) and is still slower than I'd like (I can get it closer by increasing
the acceleration to x10, but then the mouse is even shakier when I try to move
it only a little).
