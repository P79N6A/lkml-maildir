I've now reproduced it with 2.6.8-rc4. Just after boot I could not
reproduce it with the previous file, but trying with a larger (350Mb)
file it happened again. Another hint to memory pressure? I will try
again in a few hours with the smaller file to see if it happens...
Just tried, this time it happened with the first (smaller) file.
What info can I try to collect to help you find the problem?
