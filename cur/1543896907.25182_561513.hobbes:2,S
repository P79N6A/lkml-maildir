Yes. These embedded CPU's are discussed more in detail in the
linux-ppc-embedded mailing list. See:
https://ozlabs.org/mailman/listinfo/linuxppc-embedded
Let's please move the implementation details to that list.

I am using the MPC8540 and (re-)wrote a DMA driver to copy bulk image data
from a local bus FPGA to the dram memory. So, it's a proprietary driver
which can be published, but I think it doesn't make sense to have that
code in the kernel because it's only useful with exaxtly this one hardware
environment.

Please checkout the linux/Documentation/DMA* documents.
I don't know if it makes sense to do a *generic* implementation without
limitations in functionality and safety.

The scatter-gather setup implementation is working fine on my platform.
After setup/start of the DMA engine, I can poll some progress information
during the transfer to start processing of the data while the DMA machine still
sucks some more data in. At the end of the sg list, I get an interrupt and
the DMA channel is free again. Several (4) concurrent transfers should be
possible with this setup. However, some DMA-channel scheduling needs to be
implemented and made available in a generic kernel (or even userspace)
interface.
