It commits your changes to the journal every five seconds.  But your data
is then only in the journal.  It still needs to be written into your files.
That writeback is controlled by the normal kernel 30-second writeback
timing.  If that writeback isn't keeping up, kjournald needs to
force the writeback so it can recycle that data's space in the journal.
While that writeback is happening, everything tends to wait on it.
It is suspected that ext3 gets the flushtime on those buffers
wrong as well, so the writeback isn't happening right.

You'll need to reboot.
