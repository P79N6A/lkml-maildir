Hmm. shmfs interaction due to not having the shm path mounted? What
version of getty do you have?
There may be some init stuff that depends on sysv shm, and is unhappy
about not having the mount. You could try adding
	none	/var/shm	shm	defaults	0 0
to your fstab (and doing a "mkdir /var/shm") and see if that helps.
