Hi Steve,
I am using a kernel 2.0.36 on my system (large version of SuSE-kernel) with a
built in option for the maximum number of open files each process can have (I
think that's your problem).
The option/parameter is called NR_OPEN and is used with OPEN_MAX in limits.h
in ./linux/include/linux. I think in kernel 2.2.x it has the same place, so
you can edit it manually. A standard NR_OPEN_STD would be overriden during
compilation of the kernel (that's the way I did).
I increased the number to 2048 and its working.
A question of mine: I am using SuSE6.0 still trying to upgrade to 2.2.x but
after rebooting machine (compilation of the kernel is ok) it hangs up with
the message:
"Loading.....
Uncompressing kernel... Now booting the kernel...."
Nothing happens after this message (still no activity of my SCSI-drives). Can
you/anyone give me help/advice?
Greetings, Dietmar
