What do you mean by this? ie. what parts of it are a problem, and why?
I think that replacing the buddy allocator probably wouldn't be a good
idea because it is really fast and simple for page sized allocations which
are the most common, and it is good at naturally avoiding external
fragmentation. Internal fragmentation is not much of a problem because it
is handled by slab.
I can't see how replacing the buddy allocator with a completely agnostic
range allocator could be a win at all.
Perhaps it would make more sense for bootmem, resources, vmalloc, etc. and
I guess that is what Matt is suggesting.
