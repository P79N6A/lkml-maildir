Subject: 3c509 module and 2.6 kernel: not all NICs are recognized?

Finally, I tried to boot our gateway machine into 2.6 (2.6.11.8
to be certain) kernel.  The machine is quite old, it's 100MHz
Pentium-classic, yet it works as a router just fine.
And surprizingly, this is the first machine I tried to upgrade
to 2.6 which does not work.
It have 4 3c509 cards, one EISA and 3 ISA.  Here's the dmesg
output when I load 3c509 module on 2.4 kernel:
eth0: 3c5x9 at 0x2000, 10baseT port, address  00 60 08 4b 31 bf, IRQ 15.
3c509.c:1.19 16Oct2002 becker@scyld.com

eth1: 3c5x9 at 0x3000, 10baseT port, address  00 20 af 92 f6 ef, IRQ 7.
3c509.c:1.19 16Oct2002 becker@scyld.com

eth2: 3c5x9 at 0x4000, 10baseT port, address  00 20 af 92 83 02, IRQ 5.
3c509.c:1.19 16Oct2002 becker@scyld.com
http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.html
eth3: 3c5x9 at 0x5000, BNC port, address  00 20 af 99 f2 ac, IRQ 12.
3c509.c:1.19 16Oct2002 becker@scyld.com
http://www.scyld.com/network/3c509.html
(the last one, with IRQ#12 and BNC port, is EISA).
But when in 2.6, only this last EISA one is recognized by
3c509 module.
Any ideas?
Thanks.
