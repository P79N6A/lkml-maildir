Final incarnation can be picked up at

But on my machine it doesn't address the issue you speak of. When I run something
as demanding as that (end of memory, eating a large chunk of swap) it behaves 
like
yours. Gkrellm stops - no screen updates, mouse becomes very unresponsive etc. 
Though
I saw that as "normal" for the workload.
In this appartment there's no difference between 2.6.9 patched with the kswapd 
fix and
the oomkill patch, or 2.6.10-rc3 with or without oomkill patch. Can't comment 
on 2.6.8
since I didn't exhaust memory with applications back then.
