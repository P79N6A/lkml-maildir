I can't help, but I have the exact same problem here. Closing the
application (eg. camstream) and re-opening it makes it work again for a
while.
As Carl-Johan said, this happens with or without the pwcx module, so
that's not the problem.
I think it's an ohci problem.
Furthermore, the usb driver(s) behave strangely on
connecting/disconnecting the camera. Sometimes this works flawlessly,
sometimes I get a lot of USB timeout ("usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout")
and/or "USBDEVFS_CONTROL failed dev x rqt 128 rq 6 len 490 ret -110"
messages in the syslog. (Kernel is 2.4.16 and 2.4.18 - no difference)
After a couple of times disconnecting and reconnecting the camera it's
being detected. Since 2.4.18, the camera's LED sometimes is on,
sometimes off - seems quite random.
Even closing the cam application (xawtv, camstream) after the camera
stopped working never results in any error messages in the log, I only
read "pwc: Closing video device: xxx frames received, dumped 0 frames, 0
frames with errors"
