Historically the qlogic driver rescan is a 2-phase process:
1) schedule the rescan, e.g.: echo scsi-qlascan > /proc/scsi/qla2xxx/4
2) rescan, e.g.: echo - - - > /sys/class/scsi_host/host4/scan
BUT, I've just used scsi-qlascan to discover _new_ devices... not
existing devices that experienced FC connection loss.  I assume the
qla driver _should_ just bring those lost devices back?  But does the
historic 2-phase rescan for new devices speak to why the qlogic driver
doesn't automagically bring the old devices back?  Or has the latest
qlogic driver in mainline advanced past this 2-phase requirement in
general?
