Well it seems quite wrong - an iowrite32 shouldn't write more than 32bits
at a time.
My feeling is more and more that this thing is so specialized for your setup
and so narrow purpose that you're best off dropping this whole patchkit and 
just put the assembly into your driver. At least normal kernels wouldn't be 
bloated with such unlikely to be useful for anything else functions then.
