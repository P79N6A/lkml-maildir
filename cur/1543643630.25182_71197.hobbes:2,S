I don't understand what you mean by that.  Do you mean, "if it does
change ->ptrace, it doesn't need a lock"?
The locking requirements for tsk->ptrace are not documented anywhere
right now; we basically don't have any.

Before your patch, do_notify_parent didn't get called; I think that
perhaps it should be.  I'll think about that.  After your patch the
process group will be unexpectedly orphaned, which is not now the case.
Let me sit on this for a couple of hours.  I'll send you an alternative
patch to look at.
