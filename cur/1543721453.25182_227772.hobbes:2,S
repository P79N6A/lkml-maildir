Subject: [PATCH] g_NCR5380_mmio, kernel 2.6.7
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

g_NCR5380_mmio.ko does not find hardware.
I found that this very short file g_NCR5380_mmio.c, simply rebuilds 
g_NCR5380.c with a symbol defined for compile-time changes.  However, the #if 
statements in the latter use a slightly different symbol (prefixed with 
CONFIG_) which doesn't seem be get set in 2.6.x at compile time.  This patch 
allows the driver to ID the hardware.
We, here at Octagon Systems, still make an old micro-pc (8-bit ISA) SCSI host 
adapter based on the 53C400A chip supported by this driver.  I doubt many 
still use it, but as this is still an active product, we need to continue to 
offer support with our CPUs now available / compatable with Linux 2.6 
kernels.  If anyone has a similar card and it is working without this patch, 
please let me know what I did wrong.
Since we're an x86 shop, this has only been tested on x86 systems.  I doubt 
that will make any difference, however.
