I've been scratching my head on and off for a couple of days over this.
We've traditionally had reclaim problems when there's a huge amount of
dirty MAP_SHARED data, which the VM didn't know was dirty.  It's the old
"map a file which is the same size as physical memory and write to it all"
stresstest.
But we do not have such problems with anonymous memory, and I'm darned if I
can remember why :(
