Not sure I buy that. Consider that with a CPU, you control the inputs,
you've got a complete spec of the core functionality, you've got a
huge testbed of code to test that functionality, and you've got a
whole industry of people reverse engineering your work. 
More to the point, the backdoor we're worried about is one that
compromises our encryption keys to passive observers. Doing that by
making the RNG guessable is relatively easy. On the other hand
determining whether a given snippet of code is doing RSA, etc. is
equivalent to solving the halting problem, so it's seems to me pretty
damn hard to usefully put this sort of back door into a CPU without
sacrificing general-purpose functionality.
For other types of back doors, it seems likely that the NSA would go
straight to the OS vendor, or, given the state of mainstream OSes,
just use existing holes.

Yes, I was being hyperbolic.
