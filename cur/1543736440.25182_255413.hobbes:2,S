Btw, if you want to send bytes instead of blocks, I don't care. The Linux 
client can easily do
	blocks = bytes >> 9;
and I'll be perfectly happy. But if the "bytes" count you send has no
actual real-life meaning (ie it didn't actually come from the underlying
filesystem at all), then don't bother. The client might as well do
	blocks = (filesize + 511) >> 9;
if that's what the server is (badly) mangling.
