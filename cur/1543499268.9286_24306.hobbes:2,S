We are getting strange disk corruptions on 2.2.9 -- well actually I
think
that they are buffer cache corruptions. The odd bit gets flipped in
files
-- this is not noticeable until some program segfaults that used to
work.
Running rpm --verify reveals that it has suffered corruption. If I
restore
the files with rpm --upgrade --force and then immediately do an rpm
--verify,
then sometimes some of the files are corrupt. I doubt that it is a disk
problem as the system has a lot of memory and is pretty idle. 
Initially I suspected the memory (384Megs of PC100 SDRAM), but we
have been running memtest86 for several hours with no errors. We'll
leave it running overnight to see what happens.
Any other ideas on tests? I guess we could go back to 2.0.36 and see
if the problem goes away......
