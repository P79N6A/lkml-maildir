In my experience, often when people speak about 2.4.21 (which is quite old),
they in fact refer to an RHEL3 kernel, which has a "few" addon patches :-)
While I don't think that anything related to EFS might be changed in RHEL,
may it be possible that it works as a side effect of a patch in this
kernel ?
That's just pure guess anyway.
Cheers,
Willy
