Seems a little big now to be still inlined.
Also I wonder if there are really that many early callers that it
isn't feasible to just convert them to a early_cpu_to_node(). Also
early_cpu_to_node() should really not be speed critical, so just
linearly searching some other table instead of setting up an explicit
array should be fine for that.
