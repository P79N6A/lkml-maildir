When I booted the system some minutes ago I got the above message, and no swap
was added. This is the second time I got this in the last week. Other than
that, the system works fine.
I mkswap'd the partition again and everything is fine, but still, does anyone
know what the problem might be? Kernel 2.0.36, linux utils 2.9h (mkswap), mount
2.9g (swapon).
