Probably.  In Git, which is a bit more flexible than Mecurial you can
chmod your objects to read-only or use the ext3 immutable setting to
protect your existing objects.   You can even have a setup where objects
are archived onto write-once media like DVD and still participate in a
live repository, where new objects are written to hard disk, but older
object are (automatically) sourced from the DVD.
