Subject: [PATCH 00/13] Cell patches for 2.6.18
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This series are the patches that I'd like to suggest for the powerpc.git
tree for 2.6.18. There will be a few more as soon as the stuff I sent
yesterday has gone in, so I can forward-port the patches depending on
that.
