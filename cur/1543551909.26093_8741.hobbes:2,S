I totally agree, I'm really wondering if the current API would allow to create a tree
which would contain only
files needed on machine..... Typically i never use sparc or mips file in kernel
compilation. I'm dreaming of a day
when i could download these different parts:
    Kernel core source
    x86 specific part
    any driver i need
A few tar -xvzf later i'd got a working kernel, with no space lost on my HD.
