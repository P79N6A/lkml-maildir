Sure not, and I don't think "everything" in PnP will ever work. :) But
it does the same as the modalias patch to the kernel we are talking about.
There are device table entries completely missing and some other don't
match. Some of them can be fixed by adding the aliases as modprobe.conf
entries.
Thanks,
Kay
