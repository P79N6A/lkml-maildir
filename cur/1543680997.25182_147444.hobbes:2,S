Correct.

Well then, use epoll's level-triggered mode.  It's quite easy - it's
the default now. :)
If there's an EOF condition pending after you called read(), and then
you call epoll_wait(), you _should_ see another EPOLLIN condition
immediately.
If you aren't seeing epoll_wait() return with EPOLLIN when there's an
EOF pending, *and* you haven't set EPOLLET in the event flags, that's
a bug in epoll.  Is that what you're seeing?
