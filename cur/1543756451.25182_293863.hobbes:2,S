No, it's encouraged.

Note that Andries' patch does *EXACTLY* the same thing as the GPT/EFI
spec does (by using an old-style partition table for the first 2 TB.)
It should be pretty easy to add native support for this in EXTLINUX;
the big problem is supporting true access > 2 TB, which I currently
don't have any way to test.
I'll put that on my todo list.
