Possibly. Our intention is to integrate the RPCSEC_GSS security
protocol (see RFC2203) into the sunrpc code, then use krb5 as one of
the authentication flavours.
Whereas I doubt that AFS uses RPCSEC_GSS, I believe that the kerberos
code itself (+ upcall mechanism for getting user tokens etc.) could be
reused by you. I presume that you would make use of the sunrpc code
too?
Cheers,
