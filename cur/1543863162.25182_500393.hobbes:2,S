If it's done in order to make disk vendors look good in spite of
advertizing more than they deliver, yes.
1) This change isn't nescensary - any sane person will know that it's not a
   SI unit. You wouldn't talk about megabananas == 1000000 bananas and
   expect to be taken seriously.
2) No sane person would say kibibyte as required by the standard. You'd need
   a sppech defect in order to do this, and a mental defect in order to try.
   So why should anybody adhere to the rest of this bullshit?
