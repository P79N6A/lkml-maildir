Hello Marcelo
The problem seems to be one of those self-healing things that occur 
once in a while. I just tried 2.4.23-pre9 and the CD-ROM drive works 
again. Plug in the PCMCIA card, double beep, mount disk, read it, 
unmount, unplug card. A mysterious syslog message about a "bad 
special flag" that had always shown up has also disappeared.
Seems like someone has worked on it :-)
Anyways, thanks to all kernel developers,
Thom
P.S.: For those interested, the problem was about a PCMCIA CD-ROM on a 
Sony Vaio PCG-Z600NE that stopped working with 2.4.21/22.
