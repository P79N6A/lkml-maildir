Interesting.... my response:
1) The interface is basically the same.  The kernel hands you data, you
   hand it to the device.  The only difference is in the registration
   procedure.  Sounds like a very simple (and small) case to add you your
   coverage testing procedure.  You do have a coverage testing procedure,
   don't you?
2) You must always check to be sure you don't hijack a major number,
   regardless of devfs or not.
3) How hard is it to pick a default permission for a driver?   I mean,
   really... how hard is it?  If I'm being careful, it only takes me about
   45 seconds to decide on default permissions.  How long does it take
   you?  And, as in #2, you have to deal with MAKEDEV regardless of devfs
   or not.
