Hi,
 I have been hunting through ll_rw_block and related code trying to
 understand exactly what is going on and, in particular, what the
 important difference between calling ll_rw_block and
 generic_make_request is.
 The following patch tidies some things up as a result of my
 explorations, and in particular removes the need for WRITERAW.
 Explanation of the patch:
  There seem to be two sorts of calls to the code in ll_rw_blk.c for
  performing block io.
  The first, and most common, is doing io on block devices (as in
  /dev/hda1) and in filesystems.  These calls use buffers that are in
  the buffer_cache or the page_cache.  WRITE calls are typically only
  used when a "sync" is required, otherwise mark_buffer_dirty is used.
  The second sort of call is made by raid1 and raid5 calling
  generic_make_request directly, and by lvm-snap and drivers/char/raw
  calling brw_kiovec.  These IO request are *NOT* out of the
  buffer_cache or page_cache, but are out of special purpose buffers
  created by the driver, used, and then discarded.
  Writes for each of these use WRITERAW to avoid the refile_buffer
  done by __make_request.  As these are very similar sorts of IO, the
  fact that the brw_kiovec ones go through ll_rw_block and the raid
  ones go straight to generic_make_request is a bit untidy.
  After thinking this through, it appears to me that the best approach
  is to treat all io that goes to generic_make_request as "raw", and
  generic_make_request or anything below it should not fiddle with
  BH_{Dirty,Lock,Uptodate} (or probably anything else), and should
  definately not refile the buffer.
  Any IO requests that are on cache buffers and want the refiling etc
  should use ll_rw_block.
  To achieve this I:
   - lifted the tests on BH_Updtodate and BH_Dirty, and the
     refile_buffer out of __make_request and put them in ll_rw_block.
   - also lifted kstat.pgpg{in,out}++ out into ll_rw_block, which
     feels correct.
   - nchanged brw_kiovec to call generic_make_request on each buffer
     rather than gathering them and passing them to ll_rw_block.  They
     are still gathered for waiting.
   - changed raid1/5 to use WRITE instead of WRITERAW as the things
     that WRITERAW protects against are no longer under
     generic_make_request.
   - ripped the "allclean" tests of out raid5 as they cannot be done
     anymore.  That shouldn't be an issue though, as they were for
     optimising performance when parity rebuild went through the
     buffer cache, and it doesn't any more.
  In doing this, I noticed that io errors aren't propergated up out
  of wait_kio (previously through do_kio) though brw_kiovec properly.
  If wait_kio needs to be called more than once (because more than
  KIO_MAX_SECTORS buffers are used), and if there is an IO error in
  the first set of buffers, then the value returned by brw_kiovec will
  suggest that the failed block had actually been transferred correctly.
  I don't really want to dive in an figure out the best way to fix
  this, and I don't know who the "maintainer" is... any takers?
The code compiles fine, and raid5 has no problems running.  I am not
in a position to exercise the code paths in brw_kiovec, but the
changes are sufficiently simple that I feel convinced of the
correctness.  Anyone want to second the motion?
