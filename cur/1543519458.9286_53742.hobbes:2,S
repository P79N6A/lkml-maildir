Subject: [RFC] Giving capabilities to users and groups

I have an idea for a program which I would call scap (in
the spirit of sg amd su). I'm mainly trying to work out
if such a program exists already and if not, ideas on
how it would work.
I was thinking to have a file (maybe /etc/caps) that would
look like the password file but explains what caps that user
has. for example:
root:SYSADMIN,NETRAW,etc...
myuser:NETRAW...
These users could then use the scap program to get these
capabilities when they need them. This could either be done
by scap spawning a shell with the new capability or using
CAP_SETPCAP to change the capabilities of its parent.
Similarly, I'd like to be able to assign capabilities to groups.
I still need to think of a good example. (I was thinking group
disk but it appears that capabilities have no say in the opening
of devices).
I think I'd also want meta-capabilities. For example 'netmanager'
which would have all the network related capabilities. Then you
could say: addcap joe netmanager -- and they would have all the
rights attached to that.
Comments?
