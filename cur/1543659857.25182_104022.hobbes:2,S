If I understand that correctly (and I'm not sure I do), you're saying
you don't think the exec time balance should go global? That would 
break most of the concept ... *something* has to distribute stuff around
nodes, and the exec point is the cheapest time to do that (least "weight"
to move. I'd like to base it off cached load-averages, rather than going
sniffing every runqueue, but if you're meaning we should only exec time
balance inside a node, I disagree. Am I just misunderstanding you?
At the moment, the high-freq balancer is only inside a node. Exec balancing
is global, and the "low-frequency" balancer is global. WRT the idle-time
balancing, I agree with what I *think* you're saying ... this shouldn't
clock up the rq->nr_balanced counter ... this encourages too much cross-node
stealing. I'll hack that change out and see what it does to the numbers.
Would appreciate more feedback on the first paragraph. Thanks,
M.
