I believe that there's a difference here.  For the Infiniband CM, an allocation
error behaves the same as if the received MAD were lost or dropped.  Since MADs
are unreliable anyway, it's not so much that an IB CM event gets lost, as it
doesn't ever occur.  A remote CM should retry the send, which hopefully allows
the connection to make forward progress.
