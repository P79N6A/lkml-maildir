Your USB pendrive will wear faster if you use an inappropriate 
filesystem. Such filesystems require frequent writes and change their 
internal state often.
This could be alleviated by COWing the filesystem somehow and flushing 
writes when you're finished. But the modifications will be lost if 
crashes occur. The filesystem structures will still change a lot and 
require  big writes to update it.
Really, why don't you try a more suitable fs for your pendrive, one that 
changes itself less than usual fs's?
