Subject: How to speed up raid1 resync ?

Hi,
I'm performing various lvm/raid experiments on my system. As a result,
I've trashed one of the two disks of a raid1 set. So now the raid is
rebuilding, as soon as it finished I intend to retry experimenting
(disconnect one drive in the raid set, experiment with the other, if big
mistake replug the other one and sync with it).
However mdmadm resync is dog slow (if gracefully backgrounded)
$ cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid1]
md0 : active raid1 hdc1[2] hda1[0]
      2096384 blocks [2/1] [U_]
        resync=DELAYED
md1 : active raid1 hdc3[2] hda3[0]
      76886976 blocks [2/1] [U_]
      [=>...................]  recovery =  5.6% (4374912/76886976)
finish=1164.8min speed=1036K/sec
Is there a way to speed it up ? I don't want to wait 1164.8min, and I
don't care if the resync monopolises most of the system.
