Hi all,
I have implemented an auto-mount & auto-umount facility based on USB
hotplug.
An annoying problem will occur when some process doesn't close its open file
and auto-umount is trying to umount that mount point after usb disk has been
unplugged.
Is there any way to force it to be umounted in this situation?
Regards,
Colin
