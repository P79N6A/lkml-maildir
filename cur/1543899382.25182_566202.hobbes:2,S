That's true. That was one of the reason I've always wanted the
pre-suspend and post-resume hooks. (I prefer keeping the ordering there
too, rather than a notifier, but a notifier is fine I suppose).
Among the clients we want here the firmware stuff, the allocators,
etc... to get themselves in conditions that won't deadlock during
suspend cycle.
I think that's a much bigger issue overall than freezer vs. no
freezer :-)
Ben.
