alternatively; if a CPU is idle a long time we could do a software level
hotunplug on it (after setting it to the lowest possible frequency and
power state), and have some sort of thing that keeps track of "spare but
unplugged" cpus that can plug cpus back in on demand.
That also be nice for all the virtual environments where this could
interact with the hypervisor etc
