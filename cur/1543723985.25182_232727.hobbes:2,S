Sorry, but bug tracking systems rarely provide fast turnaround.  It's 
better that you post to orinoco-devel@lists.sourceforge.net to get a reply 
fast.
The patch you submitted on Savannah reverts the patch submitted by Simon 
Huggins: 
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=7995284
The patch you attached seems to be much better.  I've applied it.

drivers/net/pci-skeleton.c doesn't have power management code, but the 
driver it was based on, 8139too.c, has such code and uses 
pci_set_power_state() after pci_(save|restore)_state().  Other well 
maintained drivers (e.g. e100.c) use pci_set_power_state() after 
pci_save_state() and before pci_restore_state().  I think it's reasonable 
to follow this example.  Jeff?
