Well, IMO userland tasks should not have power to grab VFS mutexes for
indefinite ammount of time. ("fused is allowed to deadlock kernel, in
a way only write to special file helps" is ugly). Unfortunately, I
don't think there's a way to work around that deadlock within fuse
design limits... (coda was able to get around it by working on whole
files granularity, AFAICT), so we'll have to live with that.
I think we have two separate problems here, and both are
solvable, without major changes to fuse or suspend framework.
