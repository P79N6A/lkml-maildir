	Seconded. Let's leave it to this Gore wanker. BTW, he misparsed
what he heard: 'highway' thing was told about the new cross-Atlantic link,
*not* about the 'net. No need to make half of the 'net laugh/barf.

	How so? When did you look at the code last time?

	OK, Albert, you've got a smiley there and your name in From: kinda
counts for implicit C&C warning, but could you please *explicitly* warn
about such pearls? Say it, a page or two prior to the thing. This coffee
was *hot*. Thanks $DEITY I don't have a cat. Sorry, some of us may be in
the end of *long* run and may be caught unprepared.
