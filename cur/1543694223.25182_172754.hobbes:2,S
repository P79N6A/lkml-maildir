If you are using regular read/write syscalls and not too big chunks --> trivial.
If you mmap you database --> harder.
If you would like to tell the kernel, that this should not be treated
like a sequential read --> fadvise/madvise.

Here I agree as this seems like a solution. 
The problem is, that you sometimes need low latency for your
transactions and then you cannot start throttling a heavy IO process,
whose IO is already issued and who is basically just waiting for disk
eating its bandwidth.
The questions are: How IO-intensive vacuum? How fast can a throttling
free disk bandwidth (and memory)?
