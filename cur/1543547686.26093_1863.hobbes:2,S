Hello,
	Since upgrading from 2.4.0-test6 to 2.4.0-test7 I have noticed I can't
connect to some webs, www.amazon.com, www.linuxtoday.com... (trying
telnet www.linuxtoday.com 80 returns connection refused). It works with
2.2.X series, 2.4.0-test6 and bellow... It has been tested in three
different machines, with three different network cards...
	I attach the .config file.
Best Regards
