Once again. Loopback mount requires a clean unmount of root and
host filesystem. After remounting root read-only, host is still read-write
and cannot be remounted read-only.
It is necessary to provide access to the rootfs tree somewhere else
or use pivot_root, like the initrd solution below:
initrd: /linuxrc
#!/bin/sh
mount /dev/hda1 -o rw -t ntfs /host
mount /host/linux/root.img -o loop,ro -t ext3 /root
pivot_root /root /root/initrd
exec /initrd/bin/init
root:/etc/rc.d/rc.halt:
#!/bin/sh
pivot_root /initrd /initrd/root
cd /
exec /stop $RUNLEVEL
initrd:/stop
#!/bin/sh
kill -SIGUSR1 1
umount /root
umount /host
case $1 in
0) poweroff -f ;;
*) reboot -f ;;
esac
This requires static binaries of init, sh, mount, umount, an extant /etc, and a
few nodes in /dev.
