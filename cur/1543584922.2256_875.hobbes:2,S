Hi,
Look what I can provide as further info about my failure to install RH7 on
the Netfinity 5100 with the ServerRAID 4L controller:
I boot in "expert text" mode from the original bootable CD created after
the iso image available on ftp.redhat.com/
and of course I have the IBM ServerRAID for driver for Linux diskette in
the floppy drive
look what I get on one of the installation log screens:
* Cannot find /tmp/drivers/rhdd-6.1; bad driver disk
* Cannot find /tmp/drivers/modinfo; bad driver disk
* Cannot find /tmp/drivers/modules.dep; bad driver disk
* Cannot find /tmp/drivers/pcitable; bad driver disk
and
* trying to mount device /tmp/fd0
* going to insmod ips.o (path is NULL)
/tmp/ips.o: init_module: %m
Hint: this error can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including
invalid IO or IRQ parameters
I also tried mounting the driver floppy and insert the module manually but
I couldn't even mount the floppy in the shell provided by the RH 7.0
install...
Oddly I can install RedHat 6.2 with the same driver diskette on the same
machine anytime.
What do you say, how should I approach this one?
Please help me.
Best regards,
          Robert

Red Hat 7 contains version 4.20 if the ips driver.  It should install on a
ServeRAID 4L ( even without a driver diskette ).     If you want to use the
4.50 driver diskette during install, it also works.   I have installed RH 7
many times using the current ( 4.50 ) diskette and have never seen a
problem.
BTW, Keith left IBM in December.

Hi Keith,
I know that you are busy, and I apologise for taking up a little of your
precios time, but I would like to ask you a simple question.
How could I install RedHat 7.0 on a Netfinity 5100 with a IBM ServerRAID 4L
firmware 4.40.03 ?
I already tried with the latest driver diskette but it's not working, says
something like: ips module couldn't be loaded complaining about probably
some incorrect module parameters (which I didn't supply manually and I
don't know what should I).
Btw: RedHat 6.2 installs like a charm with the same drivers diskette.
Thank you,
Best regards,
     Robert
