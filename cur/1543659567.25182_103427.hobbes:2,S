ASUS P4S533 (SiS645DX)
P4 2GHz
1G PC2700
SanDisk SDDR-77 ImageMate Dual Card Reader
In 2.5.56 I can read from CF cards, but can't write to them
In 2.5.58:
With scsi & usb-storage built in I get unknown errors in the syslog
and the card won't mount
with scsi & usb-storage as modules the process trying to mount the
CF card hangs until I pull the card out and put it back. syslog shows a
change event and the process trying to do the mount reports no medium found.
In the syslog are these messages:
