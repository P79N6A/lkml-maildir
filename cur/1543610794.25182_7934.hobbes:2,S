this is just the first, more important half of O_NONBLOCK support for
block IO. Some servers (squid, TUX) rely on it for good performance.

it's for TUX's logfiles - the log file can grow to many gigabytes without
polluting the pagecache. I think a new syscall should also use this:
sys_flushfile(fd,offset,size), so that user-space servers can make use of
this feature as well. If anyone is interested in actually using this new
system-call then i can add those few additional lines. (other applications
could use it as well, eg. clustered databases to invalidate database
caches - but for this purpose the function has to become a bit more
strict.)

a TUX thing again, you are right, it makes no sense otherwise.

these are cleanups triggered by a bug i did: 'offset' was not consistently
used as the byte granularity thing, it was used as a page granularity
index once, which caused a bug in an earlier version of the patch.

for this purpose i wrote memarea_alloc() - bootmem IMO should remain a
limited boot-time helper, not a full-blown allocator.
