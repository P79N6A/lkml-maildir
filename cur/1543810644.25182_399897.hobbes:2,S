argh.  That used to work.  I'll look into it later today.
Could be that some changes in -mm broke it, or maybe not.
You could try reverting some or all of these to see if
scripts/extract-ikconfig will work for you.
extract-ikconfig-use-mktemp1.patch
  extract-ikconfig: use mktemp(1)
extract-ikconfig-be-sure-binoffset-exists-before-extracting.patch
  extract-ikconfig: be sure binoffset exists before extracting
extract-ikconfig-dont-use-long-options.patch
  extract-ikconfig: don't use --long-options
