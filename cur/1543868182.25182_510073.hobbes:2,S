Swap prefetch not only has an on-off switch, you can even build your kernel 
without it entirely so it costs even less than this patch... I'm not going to 
support the argument that it might be built into the kernel and enabled 
unknowingly and _then_ cause overhead.
Oh and this patch depends on some of the code from the swap prefetch patch 
too. I guess since they're so suspicious of swap prefetch the swap prefetch 
patch can be ripped apart for the portions of code required to make this 
patch work.
Do you still want this patch for mainline?...
