Good idea. All these cases should be optional, and they make plenty of
sense to me.

yes, but the main reason we do this isn't for multiuser systems. For
multiuser systems it's true it would solve dbench, but there must be an
option to go with task->pid and being able to specify the latency
criticak tasks from userspace would be a good idea too.
