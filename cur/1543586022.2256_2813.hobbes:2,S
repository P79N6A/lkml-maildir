They would still have to change, since now we'd have to worry about
/dev/hd* having changed meanings; also, you now cannot create a
backward-compatible /dev since /dev/hdc is (22,0), etc, in the current
scheme.  The SCSI scheme is also not acceptable; it has been a
long-standing problem that it doesn't allow enough partitions per disk.
