i do not. the question we must discuss is imho not the situation as is, but how
a header cleanup is done if functions are reworked or moved.
you will _never_ get a clear include situation, even if you remove all of the includes
and try to compile the kernel by adding neccessary header includes back.
when you include the first headers again, you will re-generate the current situation, 
because you'll never notice through compile test if there is again an implicit include
due to hierachical reasons. 
preventing this could only be done if you really do analyse each source/header file to
check what is needed. this will cause much more time for the preprocessor of your compiler,
thus there is no really advantage.
what i said in my first sentence is the imho proper way:
if you alter sources and includes get obsolete, remove them and fix compiling again for
files that formerly depended (implicit or explicit) on this altered sources.
not to much work for the developer himself and also not exhausting the compile times.
