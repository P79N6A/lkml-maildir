yes. But not that we'll only truly have to worry about that when we'll 
have context-switching performance in that range - currently it's at 
least 2-3 orders of magnitude above that. Microseconds seemed to me to 
be too coarse already, that's why i picked nanoseconds and 64-bit 
arithmetics for CFS.
