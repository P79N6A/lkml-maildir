Ok, I'll grant that.  :)
I think a BK clone is detrimental to the overall open source SCM world, 
is my main point.  I was thinking more along the lines of "useful to 
'the cause'" ;-)

a BK clone would divert attention from another effort (such as OpenCM), 
with the end result that neither the BK clone nor OpenCM are as good (or 
better) than BitKeeper.
