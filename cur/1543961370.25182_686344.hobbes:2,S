Hi,
I noticed the memory was growing without doing anything in my system ....after
some investigations , it looks like some kernel components may be involved in
this problem.
I would like to know if there is a way to monitor activity of memory (de)alloc
of the kernel in order to target which partof the system/kernel could do this..?
Best Regards
