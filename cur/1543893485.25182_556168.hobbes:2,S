It's not specific to this help text, but I start becoming a bit picky 
about this issues:
If you understand this help text after reading it, you don't need a help 
text for this option...  ;-)
What is "NX support"?
What are "non-overcommit purposes"?
What is "pagetable lookup overhead"?
And if in doubt, should I say Y or N?
"System administrator who knows which hardware components he put into 
the computer and which filesystems his data is on" might be a good 
description for the average kconfig user, and these are the people who 
should understand this help text.
