Hi,
Looking at TTY code, I noticed a weird test done in "opost_bock"
located in n_tty.c file. I don't understand why the following test is
done at the start of the function:
if (nr > sizeof(buf))
        nr = sizeof(buf);
Actually it limits the size of processing blocks to 4 bytes and I can't
find a reason why.
Second point, a lot of serial drivers call in their interrupt handler
"tty_flip_buffer_push" function. This function must no be called
in interrupt context. Why is it done anyway ?
Thanks for your answers.
       Franck
