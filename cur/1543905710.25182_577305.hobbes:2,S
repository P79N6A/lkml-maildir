Ok, hier is small testing:
I started gcc emerge. System load is between 1.47 and 1.61
I use SMP enabled 2.6.22.1-cfs-v19.1 kernel on ADM64 X2.
In gnome-terminal window i just type fast "d" and until i count 1,2 i
hold SHIFT, than i release SHIFT, count 1,2 and than press SHIFT again.
I cound 1,2,1,2,1,2 as i type "d" button. That's the string i get:
DDDDDDDdDDDddDDddDDddDDDdDDDdDDDdDDDddDDddDDDdDDDddDDDdDDDdDDDDDDDdDDDDDDDDDDDdDDD
Its anyway different as expected.
I don't have better idea how to show what my problem is.
