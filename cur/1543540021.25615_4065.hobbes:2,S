Might I suggest creating a "/lib/include" that works something like
the /lib/modules where the kernel name is used to generate the directory
for the kernel include files?
That way the "uname -r" command could be used to set a symbolic link
to point to the correct include files at boot time (or install time).
Since /lib/include could contain
	2.4.0/(kernel includes)
	2.4.0-SMP/(kernel includes)
	2.4.0-RSBAC.SMP/(kernel includes)
Then at boot time (before SV init or init really takes over)
the commands:
	( cd /lib/include
	  rm linux
	  ln -s `uname -r` linux )
This way the kernel that is active would be selecting the correct includes.
The build makefile could have an additional target - includes, that
would create the directory and copy the include files.
