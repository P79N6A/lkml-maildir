My only interest is doing this specifically for problematic cases,
e.g. the tasklist_lock. Other usages probably shouldn't be altered
during this release cycle unless they too prove problematic, in which
case their usages should be fixed by their maintainers as bugfixes.
Of course, I'm not happy to hear about this explicit recursion.
