Yes. Support for proxy-arp of subnets was removed in 2.1.x kernels long ago
(more then half-year for sure; may be year). Since noone complained when this
ugly hack was removed I think that there was so little users of this "feature"
that chances to get this back is quite low...

Proxyarp IS supported. What about subnets... I'm not seen any but AFAIK it's
not so hard. Just noone is interested (me including :-)...
