Digging somewhat deeper into my memory, I think it just so happened that
there was a keyboard with a key with a pictogram of a computer screen on
it with no really defined purpose. Since at that time there was only a
limited number of different extended keyboard types, it was added.
I think it'd make sense to use it eg. for the key that switches between
internal and external output on laptops, if the laptop generates a
keycode for the key at all. But maybe that function is already taken by
KEY_SWITCHVIDEOMODE ...
