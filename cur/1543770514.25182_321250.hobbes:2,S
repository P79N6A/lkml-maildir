Hi,
I was asked to post this to lkml.  I have also posted it to the
kernel-mentors and kernelnewbies mailing lists.
Comments/feedback/corrections/input/discussions welcome.
I did a tutorial last week (2005-may-19) on the non-technical (or social
or behavioral) aspects of the Linux kernel development community at an
IEEE conference.  Maybe it would be of some help to you and others.
BTW, it's quite long.  67 pages.  It took me 3 hours to present it
(with discussions).
  See

Thanks,
