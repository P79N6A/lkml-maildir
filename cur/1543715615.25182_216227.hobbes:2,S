I have to say two things here.  First of all, I misunderstood that
PCI slots behind a pluggable P2P bridge didn't work.  I'm sorry
about it.  Second of all, I proposed the hierarchy just because I
thought it's nice for user, but I don't push this any more:).  I agree
with you that the PCI Hotplug core doesn't need to change.

Please see my comment on this part below.

I think it depends on a hotplug driver that is invoked when writing to
a "eject" file.  In the board case, a board hotplug driver (I'm making) 
handles those CPUs, memory, and PCI slots on the board.  So my
story for board hotplug is:
  - user checks/knows what resources are on the board (dependency)
  - user writes to the "eject" file of the board properly (invocation)
I'm expecting the first one would be available with sysfs (e.g. a hierarchy,
an information file, etc). Plus, the "eject" file would be created in sysfs.
Thanks,
Kei
