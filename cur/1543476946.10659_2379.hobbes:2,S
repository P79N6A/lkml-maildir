In my first jiffy wrap fixed big-patch I did a mistake and I fixed it some
month ago after a bug report from an user of my arca patches.
I just sent this patch to Alan some time ago against his ac patches but it
seems it got not merged from him since I note that in my current arca-tree
there's still this diff pending. 
This patch is against 2.2.0-pre6, look at the code in 2.1.131 and you'll
see that it's the right conversion to the time_* functions.
