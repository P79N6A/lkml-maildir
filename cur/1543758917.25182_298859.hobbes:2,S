even/odd means that certain releases (even ones) are more magical than 
others.  That's weird, since users aren't used to that sort of thing in 
any other project.
2.6.x.y and 2.6.x-rc [where rc == serious bugfixes only!] are 
understandable to users, because they have seen that sort of thing before.
Users _aren't_ fooled by naming games.  The current 2.6-rc proves that.

LWN, Slashdot and others will not be fooled though :)  They will note 
that release 2.6.<odd> is not a real release.

2.6.x.y has a very real engineering benefit:  it becomes a stable 
release branch.  That will encourage even more users to test it, over 
and above a simple release naming change.
Users have been clamoring for a stable release branch in any case, as 
you see from comments about Alan's -ac and an LKML user's -as kernels.
