The control-pktcdvd-with-an-auxiliary-character-device patch
introduced a door locking bug.
    pktsetup, mount, umount -> door remains locked.
The problem is that pktsetup opens the cdrom device in non-blocking
mode, which doesn't lock the door. mount then opens the cdrom device
again in blocking mode, which does lock the door. umount closes the
blocking mode open, but the door remains locked, because
cdrom.c:cdrom_release() only unlocks the door on the last release, it
doesn't care that the only remaining open is non-blocking.
