The above doesn't fix the security problem. Put the last byte of the userspace
structure on an unmapped page and it will return -EFAULT lefting the invalid
mxcsr value that will corrupt the FPU again.
The right version of the above is just in linux mailbox.
The reason I did it more complex at first is because I wanted to go safe,
I wasn't sure if somebody could SIGCONT the traced task while we was copying
the data so introducing a race where it was still possible to exploit
the bug; but as Linus pointed out to me the loop in do_signal prevents that, so
we can do only one large copy and then fixup (fixing up also in the -EFAULT
case of course).
