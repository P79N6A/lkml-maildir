Hi Andrew et al.
That oops in kunmap got me thinking of my recent DEBUG_HIGHMEM
additions, so I want for a walk through the -mm4 patch, and found plenty
of instances of people making the same mistake I did... using the struct
page * in the call to kunmap, rather than the virtual address.
I guess the best way to handle it is find/notify the respective authors
of patches in the tree? The problems are in:
Reiser4 (lots)
CacheFS (lots)
afs
binfmt_elf
libata_core
(I'm hoping some of the above people will see this message and save me
some effort :>)
Regards,
Nigel
