Actually it doesn't waste an extra display line.  Either the static inline is
on a line of its own, or the first argument is on a line of its own.  Either
way it uses up two lines - unless you want to split it up further and have
four lines as per Christoph's second suggestion (static inline / void /
funcname / 1st arg).
