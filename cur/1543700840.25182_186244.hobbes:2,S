i bought a  new scsi controller , lsi21320 and was running 2.4.23 , 
after about 20 hrs the system became sluggish and then locked up... i 
switched back to a tekram u160 card i had and after a few days found this.
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0310.3/0068.html
in the messege is a link to a driver update released by lsi
ftp://ftp.lsil.com/HostAdapterDrivers/linux/Fusion-MPT/2.05.10/mptlinux-2.05
so i applied the updated driver patch to my kernel recompiled and its 
been running great ever since.. very fast too....
 Timing buffered disk reads:  316 MB in  3.02 seconds = 104.77 MB/sec
could this possibly find its way into the 2.4.23 or atleast 2.4.24 if it 
isnt already.
ciao
