There are several reasons Changes got updated.

The 7.0 stock non errata gcc 2.96 is somewhat buggy. The updated one is
ok. Changes specifies
gcc 2.95.3
and also
The Red Hat gcc 2.96 compiler subtree can also be used to build this tree.
You should ensure you use gcc-2.96-74 or later. gcc-2.96-54 will not build
the kernel correctly.
