Subject: [PATCH] loop 9/9 don't lose PF_MEMDIE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

loop_get_buffer loses PF_MEMDIE if it's added while in loop_copy_bio:
not a high probability since it's not waiting there, but could happen,
and sets a bad example (compare with add_to_swap fixed a while back).
