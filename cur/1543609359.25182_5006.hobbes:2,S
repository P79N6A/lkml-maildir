My new laptop has this combination and the sis framebuffer driver
mangles the display. The sis X driver produces a nice lavalamp style
pattern that fades to white, the kernel stays alive but the machine
needs a reboot to fix the display in both cases. 
Im guessing the lack of 5591/5592 AGP support is the problem, and I 
was just wondering if anyone is working on this or should i go bug SiS?
Everything else is 100%.
