Missed your original post, it had no subject line. At first view, your
patch looks correct. However, check the ->detect() routing and verify
it's not assuming the lock is held there. That should be the only
pitfall.
Minor nit pick -- since this driver is _in_ the 2.5 tree, there's no way
the #ifdef would not hit. So the way I've been fixing these is to just
always assume latest kernel.
I think this was already fixed though, but at least know you now you did
it right :-)
