To summarise the summary of the summary:
I stuffed up when I tried to interpret the error, but after much
sensible correction, here is a patch.  Please try it, and suggest any
other errs that should be tested for (or maybe we should invert the
sense of the test, and test for error codes that ACCESS is allowed to
return.
2.4.0 seems to get it right.
