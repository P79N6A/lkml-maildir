Er, not the pristine tree, the linuxppc_2_4 tree, sorry.  I'll try
again.  One of the problems we hit frequently is that we have to move
files from linuxppc_2_4_devel into linuxppc_2_4, once they prove stable.
But just creating a normal patch, or cp'ing the files means when we pull
linuxppc_2_4 back into linuxppc_2_4_devel we get a file conflict, and
have to move one of the files (the previously existing one) into the
deleted dir.  How do we cleanly move just a few files from a child tree
into the parent?  I think this is a lot like what would happen, if Linus
used BK and we wanted to send him support for some platforms, but not
all of the other changes we have.
