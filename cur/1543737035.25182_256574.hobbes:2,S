This looks like a reasonable short-term fix, but I think the whole
serial8250_isa_init_ports() should go away.  I like dwmw2's suggestion
of an 8250_platform.c that could use register_serial() for each port
in some platform-supplied old_serial_port[] table, which is probably
what you mean by moving to a more dynamic allocation.
AFAICS, the only reason for doing serial8250_isa_init_ports() early
is for early serial consoles, and I think those should be done along
the lines of this:
 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0409.1/1034.html
where the platform can specify a device by its MMIO or IO port address,
and we automatically switch to the corresponding ttyS device later.
