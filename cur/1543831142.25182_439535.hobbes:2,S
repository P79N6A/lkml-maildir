I was planning to make it configurable. But that would still not be as

All these options mean each listener gets to pick a "custom" range of 
cpus to listen on, 
rather than choose one of pre-defined ranges (even if the pre-defined 
ranges can change
by a configurable TASKSTATS_CPUS_PER_SET). Which means the kernel side 
has to
figure out which of the listeners cpu range includes the currently 
exiting task's cpu. To do
this, we'll need a callback from the binding of the netlink socket (so 
taskstats can maintain
the cpu -> nl_pid mappings at any exit).
The current genetlink interface doesn't have that kind of flexibility 
(though it can be added
I'm sure).
Seems a bit involved if the primary aim is to restrict the number of 
cpus that one listener
 wants to listen, rather than be able to pick which ones.
A configurable range won't suffice ?
