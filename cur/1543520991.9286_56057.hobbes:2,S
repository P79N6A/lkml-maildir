It looks to me like there was an attempt to prevent the 'C' compiler
from doing:
		movl jiffies, %eax	! Read
		incl %eax		! Modify
		movl %eax, jiffies	! Write back
....and such attempts are rarely sucessful.
	Ideally, you'd want:
		incl jiffies
...and you'd have to do it in assembly to make sure the next 'C' compiler
doesn't out-guess you.
