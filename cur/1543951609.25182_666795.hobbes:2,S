Can you guys please do these defines in Kconfig instead of headers?  I
find them much easier to track down when I have one place to look,
rather than a mess of 14 other #includes in a arch-specific header. :)
I'm also a little concerned that you just #ifdef'd in about 44 new ptep
functions in here.  Have you carefully considered doing this in a way
that would fit in better with the other architectures?

Can you elaborate a bit more on that?
