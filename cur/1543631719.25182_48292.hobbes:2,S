You have seen what? Did you really compare RTAI  and  RT-Linux  code?
Which   "substantial   parts"   are  you  talking  about?  Please  be
specific!!!

Yes, of course it was a fork at a very early point  of  the  develop-
ment. So what? Nobody denies that RTAI is based on the same core idea
as RT-Linux - that's why the RT-Linux patent _is_ an issue to RTAI.
On the other hand, a lot of significant features originaten in  RTAI,
and have been implemented in RT-Linux later - floating point support,
to name just one.

In a business, marketroids, salespukes, and  lawyers  have  different
goals from those who actually do work and produce something. Usually,
is  is the former who triumph over the latter, due to the simple rule
that those who print the money make the rules.
