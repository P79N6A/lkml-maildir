Don't know - it's a different crash, but once again one that I've
never heard of occurring before.

No, but it does slow your machine down.

No - I forgot that config option doesn't exist in mainline XFS - it's
only in the dev tree.
FWIW, I've run XFSQA twice now on a scsi disk with slab debuggin turned

the source of the problem without a test case, but as a quick test, can
you try the following patch?
Cheers,
Dave.
