	For most drivers, the result of these changes will simply be
that more device drivers are compiled out and they get less attention.
For example, Alan Cox has said that he does not want anyone trying to
fix the i2o drivers unless they have hardware to test the potential
bugs that he is worried about, especially 64-bit and big endian
issues.  Russell King, for example, has complained on linux-kernel
that the pressure to "make it compile" lead to bad fixes which are now
more hidden because just the compiler symptoms have been fixed.
       Even if you do succeed at getting people to over-prioritize
making certain files compile, it will be at the expense of whatever
else they might have done with that time, such as working on quality
of code that they are more specialized to handle, security,
implementing facilities that would subsequently have made the driver
adjustments much easier, smaller and cleaner.

	Baloney.  If you did "make modules" without "-k" before, the
build stopped at the first error, and I'm not asking for that to change.

	It worked fine before.  I am not concerned about the versioning
of symbols in files that do not compile, as attempts to link to them
will fail anyhow.  I may have to rebuild modversions.h if I fixed a
file that exports symbols, but that can often be true if the file
compiled before.
