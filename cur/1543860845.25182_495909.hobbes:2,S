Yes, this mirrors my concern on parisc too.  We had awful problems with
the locking in flush_dcache_page() as well.
However, I was wondering if there might be a different way around this.
We can't really walk all the user mappings because of the locks, but
could we store the user flush hints in the page (or a related
structure)?  On parisc we don't care about the process id (called space
in our architecture) because we've turned off the pieces of the cache
that match on space id.  Thus, all we care about is flushing with the
physical address and virtual address (and only about 10 bits of this are
significant for matching).  We go to great lengths to ensure that every
mapping in user space all has the same 10 bits of virtual address, so if
we just new what they were we could flush the whole of the user spaces
for the page without having to walk any VMA lists.  Could arm do this as
well?
