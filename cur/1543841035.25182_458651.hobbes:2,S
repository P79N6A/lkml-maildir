It is not wrong per se.
If SCSI is set to "N", then any menu items which depend on SCSI are not 
visible anymore. This is not a problem with any of the items in the SCSI 
configuration section.
But it is a problem for any items that live _in other configuration 
sections_, such as USB_STORAGE (currently not affected because it 
selects SCSI) and IEEE1394_SBP2 (does select SCSI now too in -mm).
If "select" cannot be fixed or is not en vogue for any other reason, the 
configuration tools need to be improved otherwise, so that users are 
guided to options like USB_STORAGE and IEEE1394_SBP2 when SCSI or other 
"foreign" options were disabled.
The kernel configuration is currently presented as a tree, although the 
dependencies of config options are not a tree. That's were "select" helps.
