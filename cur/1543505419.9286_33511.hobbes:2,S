and then you suggest that a set of even less tested, experimental
patches be applied to improve this situation.
Trond, HJ, G. Allen and others have put in a lot of work, for which
we're very grateful.  It _is_ a little confusing (and disappointing)
that there are different versions of three different NFS client and
server patches (and then there's the ac series, which may, or may not
include or conflict with any of these), but blindly applying them,
especially when Linus has expressed reservations at the design and/or
implementation of some of them is not the magic bullet that you might
like to think it is.
It's by no means a final solution but the code in 2.2 (and 2.3) works
quite well for many of us.  It would be rather troublesome if it stopped
working again.  The well documented and easily found patches improve
matters for many people, but (correct me if I'm mistaken) there is little
evidence that they're are harmless as you suggest.
(And why people running silly old versions of IRIX think that NFSv3 will
help I have _no_ idea :)
