James, have you checked how fast is mmaped I/O if work size > size of 
RAM? It's several times slower comparing to buffered I/O. It was many 
times discussed in LKML and, seems, VM people consider it unavoidable. 
So, using mmaped IO isn't an option for high performance. Plus, mmaped 
IO isn't an option for high reliability requirements, since it doesn't 
provide a practical way to handle I/O errors.

Can you be more exact and specify what kind of tricks should be done for 
that?
