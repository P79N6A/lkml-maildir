The following patch makes sure MOD_INC_USE_COUNT is done 1st up in the
dev->open in the following network drivers, with MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT put
in any failure paths.
 3c505, 3c507, 3c509, ariadne, arlan, at1700, atp, de600, de620, depca,
 eth16i, ewrk3, fmv18x, lance, ni52, ni65, pcnet32, plip, sk_g16,
 skeleton, wavelan, znet.
Yes, there is still more of them.  Some of them (atp, sk_g16, znet, IIRC) 
didn't have module use counters at all.
Paul.
