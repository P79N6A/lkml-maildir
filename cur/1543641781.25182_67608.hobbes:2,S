Does an lspci show any function on the board claiming to be keyboard
and/or mouse. If so then we have most of the needed logic to get it
working as an extender. Two users/box is a bit trickier as the 2.2/2.4
console layer thinks only in terms of "one user, with keyboards and
monitors". Its possible to hack X a bit to sort of cover that up.
