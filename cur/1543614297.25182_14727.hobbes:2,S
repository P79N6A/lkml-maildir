Not anymore. Apparently it is now illiegal in the UK to use Imperial 
measurements (or for that matter, anything but standard metric) in 
transactions. If people are still using the Imperial system in day to 
day life, they won't be very soon (and yes, this has infact been 
enforced at least once that I've heard of.)
I just eagerly await the day that the U.S. government decides to stick 
its ass in and tell U.S. citizens (and whatever other countries they 
decide to pressure into agreeing with them) what we can and can't use 
to abbreviate 1024bytes, since we're all too busy arguing over wether 
or not to abide by the defacto standard that has been in use longer 
than I've been ALIVE (which yes, means I've not been alive very long.)
Let me know when we're done fighting about wether or not we should 
confuse everyone (further) that tries to configure their first kernel.
