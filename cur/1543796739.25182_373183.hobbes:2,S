Which is the best reason in the world to buy and use, the open source 
video card now under development, and I hear its less than 3-4 months 
from production status now, and at a competitive, sub $150 USD price.
If 50% of nvidia's currant linux market share were to dissappear a month 
after this card becomes available for purchase by those whom one might 
categorize as believers, I'd think that would send a message loud enough 
to be heard.
Particularly if windows drivers are available, open sourced, and 
installable on a winderz box using the normal install wizard, and 
promoted as such to the joe six-packs of the world.  At the right price, 
that would send an even louder message to both nvidia and ati, who so 
far, seems to be all hat & no cattle.  While the drivers in x.orgs code 
seem to be working fairly well, and absolutely stable, I'm sure there 
are hardware things in this 9200SE I have here that are not being used 
by x.org's code.  It works well enough to play tux-racer, but not well, 
keyboard response acts like the machine is being hogged by the video.
