Here's a tip for anyone who has to track down bugs of this nature. To
greatly speed up work, just use a binary search technique. That is, go to
the section of code that's causing problem, put a breakpoint or similiar
half-way. If it dies before that point, move it back half way, after that
point, move it forwards half way. Iterate until you find the place.
Cheers,
Alex
