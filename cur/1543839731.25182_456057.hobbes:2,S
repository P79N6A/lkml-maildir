Yes.  According to C99, "An implementation might conveivably have
codes for floating zero and/or null pointer other than all bits zero."
But as long as you don't use floating point (you shouldn't) and don't
redefine NULL to something other than (void*)0, this is rather
"inconceivable" for the kernel.
