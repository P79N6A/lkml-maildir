Whoa, wait a minute.  Don't expect to have PPC (especially 4xx stuff) to
even build (much less run) in Linus' tree.  A number of things that are
under heavy development have not been submitted.  You need to grab
the PPC development tree, see 
http://penguinppc.org/dev/kernel.shtml
for instructions on pulling the linuxppc-2.5 tree.  In this case
the phys_addr_t declaration in mmu.h hasn't found its way up.
Also, these questions are more appropriate for the linuxppc-dev or
linuxppc-embedded lists (
http://lists.linuxppc.org/
) where all the
PPC developers can be found.
