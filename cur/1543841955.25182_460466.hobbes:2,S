IMHO the problem is nommu.c is written for slab only. So when slob is
enabled, it need to be considered to make some modification to make
two or more memory allocator algorithms work properly, rather than to
force all others algorithm to be compatible with the current one(slab)
to match the code in the nommu.c, which is not common enough.
Does that make sense?
