Hi!
Is there a problem with the serial-consol in the newer kernel??
I tried the description in the Documentation directory. 
The kernel comes up until there is the message Serial driver with no
options enabled (this message is not complete). Then the system crashes, 
but I cannot do anything...
Thanks for help, Nils
