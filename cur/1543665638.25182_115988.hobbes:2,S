That's Wrong API(tm).  Why do you need to keep separation between
major and first minor?  Just pass dev_t start and unsigned len.
BTW, I'd like to take a look at your CIDR for chrdev - I've got one
to resurrect and it might make sense to compare-and-merge.  And
yes, I'm finally back - hopefully for good.
