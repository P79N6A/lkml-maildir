Just spend a minute to think about multihoming and failover
between multiple links on a host.
For that the Linux default makes a lot of sense - you get automatic
transparent failover between interfaces without any effort.
In my experience everybody who wants a different behaviour use some
more or less broken stateful L2/L3 switching hacks (like ipvs) or
having broken routing tables. While such hacks may be valid for some
uses they should not impact the default case.
