Subject: 2.5.69: trivial tulip Kconfig correction

While there is a separate driver for 2104x tulips (CONFIG_DE2104X),
drivers/net/tulip/Kconfig states that CONFIG_TULIP also supports
2104x tulips. This is not the case since that support was removed
in December 2001. A user with an old tulip may thus be tricked into
configuring the wrong driver. (I was, on my PMac 4400.)
The patch below removes this misinformation from tulip's Kconfig.
