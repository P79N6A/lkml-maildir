Yes, you are right.  The corrected routine (including your little 
optimization) looks like this:
void synchronize_xxx(struct xxx_struct *sp)
{
	int idx;
	mutex_lock(&sp->mutex);
	spin_lock(&sp->lock);
	idx = sp->completed & 0x1;
	if (sp->ctr[idx] == 1)
		goto done;
	++sp->completed;
	--sp->ctr[idx];
	sp->ctr[idx ^ 1] = 1;
	spin_unlock(&sp->lock);
	__wait_event(sp->wq, sp->ctr[idx] == 0);
	spin_lock(&sp->lock);
done:
	spin_unlock(&sp->lock);
	mutex_unlock(&sp->mutex);
}

The version above doesn't suffer from that race.

It may indeed be equivalent.  But _proving_ it is equivalent is certainly 
not easy.  The advantage of spinlocks is that they remove the necessity 
for outrageous mental contortions to verify that all possible execution 
paths will work correctly.

It will generally be somewhat slower.  In addition to cache-line
contention it suffers from lock contention.  The difference shouldn't be
enough to matter unless a lot of threads are trying to acquire a read lock
simultaneously.
