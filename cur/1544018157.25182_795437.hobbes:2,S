If this is the problem I think it is, it's fixed in patches that were
merged for 2.6.29 (in -rc1), and you can work around it via umounting
and remounting the filesystem (or in case of the root filesystem,
rebooting).
However, when you said "fsck didn't help", what exactly did you mean
by that?  That fsck didn't show any problems, when you ran it while
the filesystem was mounted?  Did you actually reboot and force an
fsck, and then found that you were still getting ENOSPC errors?
I assume you have tried writing as root, and that quotas are disabled?

P.S.  If it is the problem I think it is, upgrading 2.6.29-rcX should
fix the problem, as would using the ext4-stable branch in the ext4 git
tree, or applying the patches in the for-stable branch of the ext4 git
tree:
