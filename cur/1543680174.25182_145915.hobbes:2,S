Tried them on every imaginable way:
1. 2.4.21 + my own siimage slight patch, 2.4.21 + simage from ac4, 
	pure 2.4.21-ac4
2. apic, noapic, localapic
3. uni,smp motherboards, 4 of them
4. modules, compiled in, 
5. all of options from cards bios
/proc/interrupts reports 0 interrupts for ide2,3 , whatever I do.
after bootup, after attacking ide-disk driver, there are lost interrupts.
it recognises disk as correct type, but no communication except:
1. under XP it works (but there was no linux at that mb) 
2. hdparm lets change few flags under linux, but no -X succeeds
3. after waiting for minute those timeouts and booting up, then 
/proc/ide/ide2/hde/*  reports sensible correct information
I have the card for few more days, anything to try ?
Elmer.
