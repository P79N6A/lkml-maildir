Actually, I'd suggest doing the git-checkout-script _first_. That way you 
_can_ use the careful version, which refuses to switch if it would cause 
information to be lost. Ie something like
	git-checkout-script $1 && switch HEAD to refs/heads/$1
should do it.
(And then you can choose to use the "-f" flag or not to
git-checkout-script depending on whether you want to force it).
Anyway, I think the branch switching behaviour is useful enough that I 
should make git-checkout-script understand the notion of switching to a 
new branch natively.
