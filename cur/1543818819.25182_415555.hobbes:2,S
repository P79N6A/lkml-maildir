NACK.
It is a big intrusive patch that makes it impossible to
port to some architectures, and it obscures what you
are really trying to do which is fix x86_64.
Feel free to fix x86_64, to use only page sized allocates.
Until I see a reasonable argument that none of the architectures
currently supported by the linux kernel would need a multi order
allocation for a kexec port am I interested in removing support.
As I recall the alpha had an architectural need for a 32KB
allocation or something like that.
