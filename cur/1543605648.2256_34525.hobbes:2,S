Cool. this just proofs the vm_mapped_ratio logic is not worthwhile (I
had similar results here so this just confirms).  So I'm killing it
enterely (Linus was completly right that it wans't worthwhile). I'm also
changing a bit the semantics of vm_balance_ratio (similar to pre3aa1)
and I'm lowering it down due the slight change of semantics, plus I'm
including the PG_launder (that resembles the PG_wait_for_IO logic in
pre3aa1) and slightly modified BH_wait_IO logic from Linus. Hopefully
the end result will be positive.
Thanks very much for this great feedback! :)
