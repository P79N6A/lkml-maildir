FIN-WAIT-2? 
I saw LAST-ACK sockets in the thread and I looked for them.
Please explain why you think it is a noop. I did not find any
check preventing a shutdown on a close-wait socket, and it would
end in a last-ack socket with timers off.
Now if there were fin-wait-2 and other sockets with no timers too
that would be another bug.
