ah, OK.  So it's some other queued-up callback which takes rtnl_lock.
But I still don't see what's special about keventd.  If, say, /sbin/ip is
running flush_scheduled_work() under rtnl_lock then it too should deadlock
in this scenario.

So what's a good fix?
a) Ban the calling of flush_scheduled_work() from under rtnl_lock(). 
   Sounds hard.
b) Ban the queueing of callback functions which take rtnl_lock().  This
   sounds like a plain bad idea - callbacks are low-level things which
   ought to be able to take locks.
c) Cancel the phy_change() callback within phy_stop_interrupts() so we
   don't need to run flush_scheduled_work() at all.
   This will almost work, as long as it's done in workqueue.c with
   appropriate locking.  The bug occurs when some other CPU is running
   phy_change() right now - we'll end up freeing data which that CPU is
   presently playing with.
   But perhaps we can take care of this within workqueue.c.  We need a
   cancel function which will cancel the work and, if its callback is
   presently executing it will block until that execution has completed.
   If we require of the calling subsystem a) that the work will not get
   rescheduled (that means phy_interrupt()) and b) that the callback does
   not rearm the work then things get simpler.
   But still not very simple.  It gets ugly with per-CPU qorkqueues.
