that's a nice idea, but it doesn't address the problem that someone
might go to the trouble to create such a patch and send it in, only to
have that submission generate shrieking along the lines of "OHMIGOD,
we can't delete that *yet*!!!"
that's the whole point of this wiki page:
http://fsdev.net/wiki/index.php?title=Stuff_to_be_removed
it's meant for active participation to converge on a *consensus* as to
what should go and what shouldn't, *after* which the features removal
file can be updated appropriately and patches can start to be
generated.
it's incredibly wasteful to take the time to create and submit a
feature removal patch that ends up just *establishing* that something
shouldn't be deleted yet.  i'm sure most people here can think of
better things to do with their time.
