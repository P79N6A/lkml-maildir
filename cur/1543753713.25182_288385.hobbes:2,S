Good point. I didn't even think of the low-level parts of the boot
process. I'm more worried about the high-level side. Since GRUB,
not much seems to have happened. I think we should have a much
richer boot environment by now.
We're still not even at the level of functionality typically found
in the boot PROMs of classical Unix workstations, whereas I think
we should have been running circles around them for years already.
So if there was a vote to be cast for getting kexec into mainline
as quickly as possible, you'd certainly have mine :-)
