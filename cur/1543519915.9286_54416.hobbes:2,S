I sent the following message to linux-admin, but nobody seems to know the
solution to it.  So please, if any one here can help, I would be very
appreciative.  I've even tried using lsattr and chattr as suggested by
someone on that list, to no avail.  When I do a file on these files, file
reports that they are setuid and setgid sticky block, character or socket
special devices.  Is there any way to remove them?
Thanks
Robert

Subject: How do I remove the files with the following characteristics?
I have files that look like this, in /lost+found directory.  I've tried
doing an rm 10 different ways as root, but I get permission denied.  Any
body has a clue as to how to remove them?  They are files that got stored
there as a result of a filesystem corruption (with that famous error that
says "attempt to access beyond end of device" ).
Thanks for any clues.
Here is an 'ls -l' of the /lost+found dir:
