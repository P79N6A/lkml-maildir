The "isemail" parameter to array::addstring() calls out to
get_email_address() to get the string, which breaks the string on any
' ' character (though, oddly, not other kinds of whitespace), while
hunting for a run of consecutive characters between '<' and '>'.
Otherwise, a non-blank-breaking convention that performs its work on
the raw string passed to it is used.
i.e. the error is a one-liner where the get_email_address() convention
is incorrectly specified by passing a 0 instead of a 1 as the second
argument of array::addstring() when the header matches "Organization:".
