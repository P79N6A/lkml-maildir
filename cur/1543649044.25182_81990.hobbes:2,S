I'm kind of out of time to play any more, I think I'm going to leave
2.5.43 where it is (lots of stuff not working), send the patches to -mm3
and think about 2.5.44. That should be less volatile since Linus is out.
I can't get apm to even load, it whines in depmod about missing stuff, and
I've got about two days of my so-called vacation in what I do hve working,
so a good time to call it a version.
Thanks for the pointer, I'll try -aa and -ac kernels again at .44.
