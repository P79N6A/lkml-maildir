It actually only works for 4 byte accesses. I am fixing this and will be 
posting a patch later.

I did not think that was necessary. It will certainly make the patch 
more complicated. To implement it would really require we make the 
userspace writers wait, which gets ugly since the wait is based on a 
flag that can be updated at interrupt level so you end up with some fun 
spinlocking. Not a big deal, it just starts getting ugly. Keep in mind, 
one of the potential uses of this is for power management on PPC where a 
given device could have its config space blocked for a long time.
