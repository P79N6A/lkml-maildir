To get a working WCHAN column on a 2.6.xx kernel, your top
must do that. You also must have CONFIG_KALLSYMS enabled.

No way, because:
1. kernel modules may be loaded or unloaded at any time
2. the /proc/*/wchan files don't provide both name and address
I'd be happy to make top (and the rest of procps) use a cache
if those problems were addressed. I need a signal sent on
module load/unload, or a real /proc/kallsyms st_mtime that I
can poll. I also need to have the numeric wchan address in
the /proc/*/wchan file, such that it is reliably the same
thing as the function name already found there.

This is exactly what top does when /proc/*/wchan is missing.
It does not work well, due to kernel modules, and also due
to the inability to reliably determine if a System.map file
matches the currently running kernel. Also, simply parsing
that file is slow due to the size of it.

I found that you need about 64 when using a simple hash,
but going to 256 is really cheap so why not? The old procps
symbol cache code (now unused) worked well. I notice that
you are scanning an array for ranges; it is better to hash
on exact address matches. Also, failures get cached and no
attempt was made to keep multiple items in a hash bucket.
Here it is. The rest of the code should be obvious.
typedef struct symb {
  const char *name;
  unsigned KLONG addr;
} symb;
...
static const symb fail = { "?", 0 };
...
static symb hashtable[256];
...
hash = (address >> 4) & 0xff;

Jim and I have already used profilers on top. He mostly used
gprof. I mostly used gcc's ability to call some custom code on
function entry and exit, counting either the function calls or
the CPU cycles they consumed. So, lots of luck to you, but...
(eh, this assumes you're using the all-new top in procps 3.x.x)
If you want things fast, provide the DWARF2 debug info
needed to make use of /dev/mem.  >:-)  The LKCD project
might have a patch for this; they were converting from
STABS to DWARF2 last I heard.

Oh. Well. There's your problem. The procps-3.x.x code will only
read /proc/*/wchan for the processes shown on your screen.
It also doesn't corrupt wchan with a buffer overflow.
