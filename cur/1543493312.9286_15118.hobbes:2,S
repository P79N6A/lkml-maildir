IRQs arriving through IO-APIC pins can be mapped to 'high' interrupts. The
Linux PCI layer completely hides this from drivers, ie. if you use the
proper PCI primitives it should work just fine. PCI drivers should expect
any IRQ from 0 to NR_IRQS-1.

where does the driver get irq12 from? We do not rewrite the PCI
configuration space, so if there is some direct poking going on you can
get irq12. Does the driver use the PCI layer to get information about the
card?
