Bingo! doing the above fixes this problem.
And... strange, since I did test the system with e1000 unloaded, but still got same bug,
back when I chased that bug, thus it is probably not related to e1000 and WOL.
the ACPI wake-up source (I have read the DSDT, and ICH datasheets, thus I know that this is a set of bits in southbridge)
of e1000 is shared with EHCI and HDA sound codec.
(But usb on my system only able to wake from S3, and the soundchip which can theoretically wake up from S3 too, doesn't have this ability)
(But disabling this wakeup source, fixes this bug too)
Thanks,
