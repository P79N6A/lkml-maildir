I've seen this problem on my board (Epox 8RDA3+) as well. The root cause seems 
to be interrupt link devices enabled without regard for the actual device 
status. A recent patch that delayed IRQ assignment to device activiation time 
fixed this for me; you might want to try a fresh -mm or -bk kernel.
Hope that helps,
Daniel.
