sorry, I have heard this one to many times. people say "turn off the r
commands and install ssh/kerberos, but make sure that I can still have
automatic authentication between machines so that programs can run without
human intervention"
the problem wiht this is that once someone gets onto one of these machines
thy still have access to the other machines, it doesn't matter if you are
using rsh, ssh, or something else (and if you use ssh you pay a
significant penalty due to encryption overhead) If you have machines on
your server network that you do not maintain in a secure manner, nothing
you do will work. If you do work to keep them secure (and have intrusio
detection to help you discover when you fail) then using the r commands is
not NESSASARILY a security hole.
