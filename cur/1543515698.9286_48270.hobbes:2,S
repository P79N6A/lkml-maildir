Subject: [PATCH] 32-bit UID support for 2.3.27pre5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi. I've updated the 32-bit UID support patches to the latest kernel
pre-patch. They are available at:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991110/
Changes from yesterday:
	- updated to pre-patch 2.3.27-5
	- use different unused fields in the stat structure to leave room
	  for future nanosecond resolution time (as suggested by Ulrich
	  Drepper)
If anyone is interested in looking at this, the crucial part is the
architecture independent patch:
http://www.engin.umich.edu/caen/systems/Linux/code/misc/2.3/19991110/linux-arch-independ.patch
The rest of the patches are working suggestions of how the various
architectures and filesystems can be converted to use this framework, but
they are of course subject to approval by the maintainers involved.
Thanks,
Chris Wing
