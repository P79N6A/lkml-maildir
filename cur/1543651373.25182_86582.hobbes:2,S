AIX has 4 people doing dumps in Austin (otherwise known as ZTRANS).  There are
others in other countries.
The folks from other countries were brought to Austin for training (usually for 3
months).
There is usually one person in L3 doing dumps in Austin for service, although
every subsystem has someone that specializes in reading dumps for that subsystem.
The first 4 people only do a scan of the dump to see if it's a known problem.  If
it's not
a known problem AND it's in AIX code it goes to whoever it is that owns that
subsystem.
Dumps are only the beginning with AIX.   Trace hooks along with dumps are VERY
useful.
The trace hooks are also what the performance people use.
The Linux kernel  is _extremely_  painful to debug compared to AIX.
