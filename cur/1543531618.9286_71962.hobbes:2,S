Alan, does it make sense, in ANY situation, to disable overcommit? Because
AFAIK, a system without overcommit would always have to kill processes
before an equivalent overcommitting system would.
It seems to me that this whole overcommit debate is just avoiding the real
problem, which is how to decide which tasks to kill.
