The dmesg you attached was for -mm4
I didn't see anything wrong with it.
Is it an example of a successful, or a hung boot?
I don't understand the description above -- are you saying that
boot hangs at boot in one of two places?  Any difference if
you remove the processor module, or build w/o CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR?
Do other versions before -mm5 work okay?
thanks,
