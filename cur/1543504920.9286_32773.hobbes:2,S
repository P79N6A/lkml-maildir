f00554d8 - As close as I can come is between these two symbols:
f005546c T do_select
f00556e4 T sys_select
     Does this mean it's in the do_select() function?
 -----
f0043cac - As close as I can come is between these two symbols:
f0043c80 t do_try_to_free_pages
f0043d7c T kswapd
     Again, this is on Sun SS-10 with quad Hypersparc CPUs.
     Anybody that can elaborate on the correct interpretation, please do.  As
I've previously stated, I'm not very knowledgable in the arena of Linux kernel
hacking.
