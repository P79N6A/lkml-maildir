I want to kill phys at some point - we have topology information
already present in sysfs in much better form. Can we have a new
hotplug variable HWDEV= which is kobject_path(input_dev->dev). If
input_dev is not set then we can just dump phys in it. And the class
id will still be inputX. Will this work?
Btw, I really doubt that topology information is important here as the
only thing that one needs to do when new "input_device" appears is to
load one or more input handler modules based on device's capability
bits. The decision whether a device is "good enough" to create a
device node should be done by hotplug handler for the other "input"
class.
