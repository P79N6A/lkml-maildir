	That is partial possibility, but the example is
	incomplete, and dangerous in case the machine
	has more than about 800 MB memory. (E.g. it has,
	and uses, HIGHMEM facility.)
	It is also completely wrong approach in case
	the interface does not need to be high bandwidth
	payload delivering directly into user space,
	but e.g. control some aspects of hardware.
	("network interface" sounds, to me, very much
	 of NETDEV class device at which MMAP tricks
	 in general are wrong.)
	The person asking for pointers didn't give
	enough details for good advice.  Supplying
	the many ropes which Linux has for hanging
	oneself is not a good advice.
