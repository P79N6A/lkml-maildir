Thought about this whole thing some more, and it seems to me as follows:
what we really want, and need, is a "panic-level=X" option, where X will
naturally vary for differnet users.  I suspect there are many users
today who would prefer a panic (and reboot) on a KERN_CRIT message, even
at runtime.  For finer control, we need a message subsystem tag, but
that is something that would be highly desirable anyway.
As such, the initramfs decompression failure should be a KERN_CRIT or
KERN_ALERT message, and not a panic per se.
