If you are a user that wants this kind of support, then use a distro
that can handle this.  Obvious examples that come to mind are both
Debian and Gentoo and Fedora and OpenSuSE, and I'm sure there are
others.
But if you are a developer, you can usually stay up to date by tracking
the main releases, which should be about once a month.  If you have
problems porting your stuff to the latest kernel when you need to submit
it for inclusion, there are lots of people to help point you in the
proper direction for what is needed to be done.

Sure, then use a different distro for them.  That's why Linux has so
many different ones, they all are targeted at different users.
