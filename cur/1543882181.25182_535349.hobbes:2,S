It has a lot of common code with uswsusp.  Practically, the saving of the image
is the only part of it that could be removed, but this is simple and _really_
helps with debugging.
In principle, we could add suspend2 as an alternative (in analogy with the I/O
schedulers, for example), but I think for this purpose it should be reviewed
properly.
There also is a real problem with how it uses the LRU pages.  It _seems_ to
work, but at least to me it seems to be potentially dangerous.
Greetings,
