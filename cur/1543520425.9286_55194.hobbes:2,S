The offset is larger then the length of the function. This often means
that the module which caused the oops was not loaded/loaded to a
different address when ksymoops tried to decode the oops.
It's virtually impossible to analyze such an oops report, could you
crash your server once more?
* disable the EIP translation of klogd [klogd -x]
* insmod the scsi module.
* save your /proc/ksyms and /proc/modules file.
* crash the server
* <restart?>
* run 'ksymoops -k /tmp/ksyms -l /tmp/modules' and post the result.
How much memory do you have installed? 256 MB?
