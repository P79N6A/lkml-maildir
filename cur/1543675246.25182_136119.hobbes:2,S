See the stats posted to lkml from time to time on errors and warnings. The
2.4 stable kernels don't compile cleanly, with some combinations of config
options they may not compile at all. The ones which compile and work, even
with all manner of warnings, are a good place to start doing some
housekeeping and sending it back to the maintainer.
Maintainers vary on their desire to push cosmetic fixes into working
code, even when they are correct.
