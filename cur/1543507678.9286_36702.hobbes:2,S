Have you run this in conjunction with other NFS implementations?  I have
HP-UX 10.20 and Hummingbird's
Maestro NFS for NT running.    The 2.2.12 knfsd (no patches) seems to have a
problem clearing the client after a
downed Linux system comes back up.  On the both the Linux box and the HP
machines this is reported as a
"stale NFS file handle" which will not umount.  On the Linux side you can
clear this by explicitly remounting the file
system.  On the HP side I have found no way to resolve this short of
rebooting the machine.  This is what drove
me to applying the knfsd updates - which started the other problems.
Of course, the problem could be the HP implementation (not having the source
I can't check :-( ) but it only
seems to happen with Linux NFS servers.

Very possible (I have made a mistake on occasion).  Thoughts on how to
resolve this?
