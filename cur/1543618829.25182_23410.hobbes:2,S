We spent four years on that. It was also done in a very careful and 
precise manner starting with SMP that gave the same guarantees as non SMP
for the 2.0 kernel tree, then moving on to relaxing guarantees in certain
places -as they were audited- for 2.2 and with 2.4 increasing the coverage
to all major points of contention except the scsi layer
