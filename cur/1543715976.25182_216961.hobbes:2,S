It surely _looks like_ it's a bug, but it isn't. cpufreq drivers can either
have a "->target" or a "->setpolicy" function defined in the cpufreq_driver
struct. If it's ->target, ->governor needs to be set, if it's ->setpolicy,
->governor may not be set, or at least should not be set. As there's only 
one ->setpolicy cpufreq driver (longrun), it's not as clear as it should be.
The difference between target and setpolicy cpufreq drivers is the
following: on the first type, the CPU can be set to run at a specific
frequency. setpolicy drivers can set the CPU to a frequency range; the CPU
itself at which frequency to run within this range -- an interesting feature 
of Transmeta CPUs, which made this distinction necessary.
