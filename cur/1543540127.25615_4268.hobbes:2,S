Urg, we should mess up /proc even more. It is a process filesystem.
IMHO /proc/<pid>/ns (plan9-like) would be a good (an namespace-aware)
replacement for both /etc/mtab and /proc/mounts.
If someone ist interestead I'll code a simple implemenation (all processes
share the namesspace, execpt the ns-file of chroot()ed processes drops
all mounts and bindings under it's root and shifts the rest up.)
