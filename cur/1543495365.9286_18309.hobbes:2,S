Just think about it for a second: if you preempt a RT task with another RT
task (yes this is possible, and yes, this is a RL example), then we
immediately want to 'push' that RT task to another CPU. Also there are
other, non-RT cases where 'pushing' a process to another processor makes
sense. (just think about different static process priorities for a second)

then why do you say it's a performance hit? It's something we need for
correctness, it doesnt affect the common case, where is your problem?
