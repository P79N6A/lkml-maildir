Isn't this producing noise/pops? (since you maximize the volume).

? The scale (AC97 and OSS) is linear in dB units which is,I believe, how
we perceive sound.

Could you include this macro (it gives you perfect accuracy and
prevents mistakes):
/* scales the range a:b to min:max rounding to the nearest integer */
#define scale_range(val, a, b, min, max) \
                ((((val) - a) * ((max) - (min)) + (min) * (b - a)) *
1000 + (b - a) * 500) / (1000 * (b - a))
and then calculate the volumes as:
left = scale_range(left, 1, 100, mh->scale, 0);
instead of
((100 - left) * scale) / 100);
I will provide a patch if you agree.
Everything else looks ok but I still need to test it.
