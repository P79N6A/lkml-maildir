So for every directoy hiearchy on a shared filesystem, each user needs
to have the complete list of bindmounts needed, and automatically resync
that across all nodes when a new one is added or removed? And then have
that executed by root, because a regular user can't?
Sure. Very cheap and sane. I'm buying.
