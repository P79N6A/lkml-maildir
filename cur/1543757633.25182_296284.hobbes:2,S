I would do an easy 95% solution:
When process has default process policy set temporarily a prefered policy
with the new node
[this won't work with multiple nodes though, so you have to decide on one
or stop the process if that is unacceptable]

I would just ignore them.  If user space wants it can handle it,
but it's probably not worth it.

I wouldn't bother fixing up VMA policies.

I would set temporarily a prefered policy as mentioned above.
That only handles a single node, but you solution is not better.
