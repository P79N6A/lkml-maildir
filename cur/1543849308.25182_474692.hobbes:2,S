So tell me then, where is it if windows can see it, but linux can't?

Well, no doubt it is only m$ who can have vcd player in the kernel -
the point is the CD does NOT get read, neither by xine nor by any
other known to me tool. I asked here because the kernel is the only
source of any messages addressing the unplayability of the CD - all
the others just hang - so it looks like a kernel issue, doesn't it?
And as far as I understand you, you are trying to tell me it is
everything OK with the kernel, and the problem lays somewhere else,
yes?
