I actually done it, and a /sys/module/vt popped up, as expected.

It's my first.

I don't know who's deciding what the * in /sys/module/* will be, but it seems 
that the module name will become the one that is listed in obj-y or obj-m, 
respectively.
In your usb case, this would be:
obj-y := usbcore
usbcore-objs := blinkenlights usbfs_snoop otherfiles uhci-hcd
Seems fine for me.
And vt.c is one that applies to obj-y
