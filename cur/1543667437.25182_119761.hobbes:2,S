Just to underscore Arjan's point:  non-mainline patches are very 
actively discouraged at Red Hat.  As time progresses the maintenance 
cost of EACH non-mainline patch increases.  Non-mainline patches do not 
get the benefits of wide community testing, review, and feedback. 
Further, Red Hat employees in my experience typically land patches in 
the community _first_ -- witness my netdriver work (goes me -> Marcelo 
-> RH), DaveM's net stack work, and Alan's -ac tree.
