Hi There
Do you have any kids going to college or university?
====================================================
How would you like to help their education?
You know they need their own Laptop computer nowadays.
Yes I know, a couple of grand is a lot to come up with.
But how about £200 ?
Don't you think they are worth a small investment to give 
them a chance.?
Here is your opportunity to MAKE THEIR DAY and give them 
a fair start in life.
             -----------------
I recently bought a large quantity of ex-lease laptop
computers from a major bank'

I am also happy to sell them because of the quality.
