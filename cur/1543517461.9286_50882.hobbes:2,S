You should mark at least 'spin' as volatile, otherwise bad optimization
can occur...

And remove "eax" from list of used register to get it compile in gcc-2.95.2

Son:

Look into code. Son is for any reason started first. While it does
  pars->spin -= key;
  while (pars->spin) key = unique();
  pars->spin += key;
  
Operations: read, sub, write, read, compare, read, add, write
So there is                   <------------------------->
this window to switch to parent. But parent does
  while (pars->spin) key = unique();
and this includes 'rdtsc' which is not very fast (and without -O2 it does
also call/ret). If you add 'unique()' after 'pars->spin -= key;', it will 
happilly print couple of 'Good' (after some time it will core dump).
                                    Best regards,
                                            Petr Vandrovec

P.S.: I do not say that I'm right... But I think that I'm.
