There used to exist a battery of tests for this, but a FIPS revision removed
them. You cannot really easily define a True RNG as secure or not with
simple tests.
I'd suggest googling after the papers validating the Intel and VIA Padlog
hardware RNGs, they are much better reading than FIPS for this.
If you want a software implementation of all the former FIPS tests, please
get the Debian fork of rng-tools, or Jeff's upstream rng-tools (Debian's has
a lot more stuff, but I don't recall if it has any extra FIPS
functionality).
I should get around to submit patches to Jeff one of these years.  It is
about a week-man-hours of tedious work, though.
