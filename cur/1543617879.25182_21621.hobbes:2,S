This is enough, IRQ can be found from that datum. I assume this is an ISA
NIC? If PCI, no such parameters are needed. BTW, NE clones are (in)famous
for their bizarre assortment of bugs, you might have hit one that doesn't
work with Linux.

What does lsmod(8) tell you? If you do an "modprobe ne io=..." what does it
say?
If your guess at IO is wrong, nothing happens. If the NIC is _not_ an NE,
strange things could very well happen. It might be broken, not installed
correctly, jumpers set wrong, ...
