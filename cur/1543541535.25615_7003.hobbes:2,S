But "tar" won't even _see_ the thing. Unless "tar" starts to know about
S_IFCOMPLEX. In which case it's a non-issue.
Remember: unix-only programs will only see the regular data side. They
won't ever see the other resource forks at all. Ergo, they cannot break.
Programs that are aware of S_IFCOMPLEX are aware of it. Ergo, they cannot
break.
In short: not a problem.

Oh, name case-insensitivity is _much_ worse than forks will ever be.

Note that no way is this going to happen until 2.5.x anyway, so don't
worry.
And it won't happen at all unless somebody starts to care more about
things like HFS than historically people have cared so far. NTFS may end
up being the thing that makes us do this. But it may be that even NTFS
isn't important enough.
