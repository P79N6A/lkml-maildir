Hello all,
So far I have been following:
http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1479435
For tuning XFS; are there any other parameters or methods of 
tuning/optimization that are available to the end user?
Furthermore, I was wondering if anyone has tested 
CFQ,Deadline,Anticipatory,noop with XFS which did they find the best?
Thanks,
Justin.
