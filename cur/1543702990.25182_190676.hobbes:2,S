By the way, it is always block 65680; also across reboots if that is any indication and I have seen other processes like artsd write to that block without dirtying pages before as well.

Ehm... I don't know how to go from a block to a filename on reiserfs. 
Jens, do you have an idea?
Anyway, the other possibility is to use other file activity monitoring 
tools. Some fam client maybe (couldn't find any so quickly); maybe 
Filemon (
http://www.sysinternals.com/linux/utilities/filemon.shtml
) will 
work, but I don't know if it works for Linux 2.6. You may also try "lsof 
| grep kded", and see if it's one of those files. For me, it gives:
# lsof |grep kded
kdeinit    1185 bsamwel  mem    REG       3,65  117196    5146489 
/usr/lib/kded.so
kdeinit    1185 bsamwel  mem    REG       3,65  111412    9470211 
/usr/lib/kde3/kded_mountwatcher.so
kdeinit    1185 bsamwel  mem    REG       3,65   62408    9470683 
/usr/lib/kde3/kded_kinetd.so
Alternatively, you can try to attach an strace for kdeinit: kded, and 
see what calls it makes, e.g. "strace -p <pid>" or something like that.
