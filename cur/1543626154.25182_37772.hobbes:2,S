You might want to reconsider that stance.  It could open your mind. ;-)
BTW: this is not at all an ia64-specific issue.  It applies to any
arch that doesn't maintain a frame pointer on the stack.  Basic
compiler technology.

I haven't done such an investigation.  I believe the ia64 prototype is
reasonable and probably implementable on all platforms that can unwind
the stack in the first place, but before making a change to the stable
kernel API, I'd think someone would have to investigate this a bit
further.
One issue to consider is whether it's safe to call the routine on a
task that is running on another processor.  The ia64 implementation
can handle this gracefully, because it's sometimes better to print a
meaningless (garbled) stack trace than to make provably certain that
the task won't be running on any other CPU.  A related question is
whether the routine can be called with interrupts masked.
My sense is this is something that should be considered for 2.5 first.
