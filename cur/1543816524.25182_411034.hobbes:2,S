Oh, if only that worked.  Actually, what happens is the "struct yyy;"  
declaration inside of struct xxx looks just like "struct yyy;" out in  
the middle of some random header file.  It predeclares the existence  
of a struct yyy and does nothing else.
For instance, the following sample program:
   struct foo {
   	int a;
   	int b;
   };
   struct bar {
   	struct foo;
   };
   int main()
   {
   	struct foo myfoo = { .a = 1, .b = 2 };
   	struct bar mybar = { .a = 1, .b = 2 };
   	return 0;
   }
Compiled like this:
   gcc mytest.c -o mytest
Generates these errors:
   mytest.c:7: warning: declaration does not declare anything
   mytest.c: In function `main':
   mytest.c:12: error: unknown field `a' specified in initializer
   mytest.c:12: warning: excess elements in struct initializer
   mytest.c:12: warning: (near initialization for `mybar')
   mytest.c:12: error: unknown field `b' specified in initializer
   mytest.c:12: warning: excess elements in struct initializer
   mytest.c:12: warning: (near initialization for `mybar')
Cheers,
