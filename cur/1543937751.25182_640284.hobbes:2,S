Subject: Why not creating a GIT RT tree ?

Hello,
Maybe I missed it but I'm wondering why GIT is not used for
the RT development ? I can't find a rt tree anywhere and all
new rt release spoke about a patchset to apply on mainline
kernels.
Another question, is there a TODO list somewhere which would
help to port the RT patch to a new architecture ?
Sorry if the questions are dumbed but I'm just new to this
project.
Thanks
