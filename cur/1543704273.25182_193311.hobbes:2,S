Subject: Hard lock-ups with 2.6.1-rc1; plus is there an "ac" equivalent for 2.6.x?

I switched from 2.4.22-ac4 to 2.6.1-rc1 in the hope that perhaps if I
could reproduce the hangs my SIIG SIi680 Ultra ATA 133 controller is
causing in a 2.6.x kernel, the people on this list might be more
forthcoming in suggestions for debugging them (I've received no
responses at all to my request for help debugging the hangs with
2.4.22-ac4).
I've had to switch back to 2.4.22-ac4 because 2.6.1-rc1 regularly,
reliably locks up on me under heavy load.  I don't think this is
related to the IDE controller lockups I'm seeing occasionally under
2.4.22-ac4, because it happens reliably under heavy load and the
lockups under 2.4.22-ac4 weren't nearly as reliable.
Furthermore, even before it looks up, I find that the performance
under heavy load is much slower than 2.4.22-ac4's performance.
I understood how to get the ac kernel patches to make a 2.4.x kernel
into something useful, but I don't know if perhaps there's something
equivalent for 2.6.x kernels which I'm not doing but should be.  Alan
doesn't seem to be putting out patch-sets for recent kernels.  I see
the "mm" kernel mentioned regularly on this list, but I don't know if
that's something I should be using instead of the plain kernel, and if
so, how to get it (for the ac patches, I have looked in
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/alan
).
I'd appreciate any help and/or suggestions you can provide.
Thanks,
  jik
