You'd end up copying data around like crazy, which is why having sectors
which are even fractions of the page size is such a good idea, which is why
sane people are doing things that way. Apparently the ISO people had
different ideas.  :-/
I could use something like that myself -- there's an old SCSI tape drive
(40 MB only, though -- the old Apple/3M thing, it shows on the bus as a
device of type 0x10 or so...) lying around in my computer room which
accesses the tape as a block device (using very odd-looking SCSI read and
write commands, and a block size of 8192 bytes) that I'd love to be able to
play with, just for the hell of it.
Of course, there's always the userspace-NBD-to-generic-SCSI solution...
... but somehow, that solution looks like it's a lot less fun. ;-)
