Are we missing something here?
Why does, for example, smp_send_reschedule() not have the same problem? 
Because we've gone around and correctly removed all references to the CPU
from the scheduler data structures before offlining it.
But we're not doing that in the mm code, right?  Should we not be taking
mmlist_lock and running around knocking this CPU out of everyone's
cpu_vm_mask before offlining it?
