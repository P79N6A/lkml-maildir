Subject: [PATCH] jbd_commit_transaction() races with journal_try_to_drop_buffers() causing DIO failures

Hi Andrew & Jan,
I was able to reproduce the customer problem involving DIO
(invalidate_inode_pages2) problem by writing simple testcase
to keep writing to a file using buffered writes and DIO writes
forever in a loop. I see DIO writes fail with -EIO.
After a long debug, found 2 cases how this could happen.
These are race conditions with journal_try_to_free_buffers()
and journal_commit_transaction().
1) journal_submit_data_buffers() tries to get bh_state lock. If
try lock fails, it drops the j_list_lock and sleeps for
bh_state lock, while holding a reference on the buffer.
In the meanwhile, journal_try_to_free_buffers() can clean up the
journal head could call try_to_free_buffers(). try_to_free_buffers()
would fail due to the reference held by journal_submit_data_buffers()
- which in turn causes failues for DIO (invalidate_inode_pages2()).
2) When the buffer is on t_locked_list waiting for IO to finish,
we hold a reference and give up the cpu, if we can't get
bh_state lock. This causes try_to_free_buffers() to fail.
Fix is to drop the reference on the buffer if we can't get
bh_state lock, give up the cpu and re-try the whole operation -
instead of waiting for the vh_state lock.
Does this look like a resonable fix ?
Thanks,
Badari
