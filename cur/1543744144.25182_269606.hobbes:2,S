nack. We switch the kernel stack in switch_to() so 'next' here is the
old task we switched to before we went off the CPU. The value of 'next'
doesnt get carried over a context-switch. (we do carry 'prev' over via
assembly trickery because we need it, but not 'next'.) This change would
most likely result in rare, hard-to-track-down BKL-related crashes all
around the place.
the other bits are OK, please resend them.
