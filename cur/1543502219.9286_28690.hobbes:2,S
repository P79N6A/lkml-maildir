I reviewed your patch briefly and have a few comments.
The quota code doesn't appear to be updated. I know this will break backwards
compatibility and the quota code in general needs to be redone, but it should be
done or at least be put on the to do list.
The /proc filesystem needs to have a few things updated as well, things like
/proc/<pid>/status list the uid & gid of the owning process, otherwise ps is
going to break (though it will need updating anyway).

But what if I need more than 4.2 billion users? *grin*.
Actually, what does UNIX98 say about UID length? Is it defined as 16, 32 or 64
bit?
