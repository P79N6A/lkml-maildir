Do you know the official NIC product name e.g Pro/100B. I need to identify the LAN Controller. There are differences between  557 (not sure if 557 can do WOL), 558 and 559 how they ASSERT the PME# signal. Even the same chip have differences between steppings.
I suspect that PME# is not being  DEASSERT after the Wake-up packet is received
