Just my 2 cents, but if your environment is that hostile, you don't even
need to lock your directories. A simple solution is to modify (or
wrap) rm in such a way that it truncates the files to size 0 before
unlinking them. No leak of quota space, no security concern, no need to
lock one's directory, no need for set[gu]id script, no need for new
groups...
