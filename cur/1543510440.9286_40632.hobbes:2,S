Linux-7k (ARM; Psion S5/Geofox) is still largely aout-based, because the
only usable binary distribution we know of is some RedHat 3.0.3. People
are now also compiling ELF user space things with ELF, so I hope that we
can converge on ELF only pretty soon. The kernel is currently some 2.2.1
with tons of patches, so any aout hostilities added in later kernels
haven't hit us yet.
