Something like:
  dd if=/host/tmp/bigfile of=/tmp/bigfile bs=1048576 count=100
and run 'top' or 'watch something' in another terminal, which
sometimes completely stops updating during the write.

It's not I/O performance I'm worried about, but scheduling latencies.
CPU use inside and outside the UML is minimal, so I can't see where
this slowdown comes from.
