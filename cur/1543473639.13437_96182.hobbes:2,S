I tried the ide-floppy.patch not against linux-2.1.132-ac2 but 2.2.0-pre1
and got the following:
ide-floppy.c: In function `idefloppy_ioctl':
ide-floppy.c:1463: void value not ignored as it ought to be
make[2]: *** [ide-floppy.o] Error 1
Is the patch valid only against 2.1.132-ac2 ? Or is there a way to fix
this ? The patch itself applied with some offsets but no *.rej.
kernel compiled using gcc 2.7.2.3
