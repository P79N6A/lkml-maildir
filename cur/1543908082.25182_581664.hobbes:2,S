This is what I worked out in conjunction with the denizens of the SELinux
mailing list.  What would you have me do differently?  Change things like:
	u32 (*act_as_secid)(u32 secid);
to something like:
	void (*act_as_secid)(const char *newsecdata, u32 newseclen,
			     char *oldsecdata, u32 *oldseclen);
