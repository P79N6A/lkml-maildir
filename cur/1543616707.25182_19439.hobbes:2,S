	Please indicate what kind of interface your CDROM drive
has (and preferably make and model of the drive) and what
errors you saw.
	If you are using an IDE or SCSI CDROM drive, then the problems
you are experiencing have nothing to do with my patch.  My patch was
only for the very old "proprietary interface" CDROM drives, which are
almost all "1X" or "2X" speed drives.
