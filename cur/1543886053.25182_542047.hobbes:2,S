Yes, let this be a decision the individual PCI driver does, I don't want
to put this two-stage thing in the driver core, but any individual bus
can implement it if they really want to.

As long as the ->probe() call returns that the driver has clamed the
device, and the ->remove() call can be handled properly while the driver
is off doing whatever it wants to in the initialization, the driver core
should work just fine, no changes needed.
