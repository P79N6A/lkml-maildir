The other problem is that GIT patch sets are completely useless for
merging and reviewing if you simply fire off a blast of 70 changesets.
Each time you do it at least one gets queried or a NAK and the lot go in
the bin again. Repeat 50 times...
It would be enormously helpful if instead we got say 15 small patch sets
which are independant so that a query or NAK means 14 sets get applied
this time around not zero.
