| Sample testing targets, to see if you made any typing errors.
|
|   make vmlinux
|   make arch/i386/boot/bzImage
|   make drivers/acpi (non-recursive)
|   make drivers/acpi-r (recursive)
      make -f Makefile-2.5 <target>
      Yes, that works fine.
      So if my .config file has lots of USB modules =m,
      I can just make drivers/usb-r and it will make all
      of the specified modules ?
      Yes, I did that.

| You mixed the old kbuild 2.4 make *config with a kbuild 2.5 build.
| Don't do that.
DDT.  Got it.  Thanks.
| One of the downsides of coexistence, users can get it wrong.
Right.
| make -f Makefile-2.5 menuconfig installable
Working now.  I appreciate your help and kbuild 2.5.
