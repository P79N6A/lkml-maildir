Can anyone give me some hints on setting up an AMI P-II planar BIOS so that
video times out and blanks but can recover under Linux?  The system board 
is a SuperMicro P6SBS (first version) with a 400 MHz. P-II.  The board dual
boots between Linux and NTW4 (SP4).  Works fine under NT, but if I set it 
so that it times out for inactivity it is out permanently under Linux.  Only
way that I have found to recover is B-R-S and let the boot check the disk 
since it did not shut down cleanly.  Having the video time out is an absolute
necessity for me.  I currently have version 1.5b of the BIOS, but the problem
has occurred in all versions starting at 1.0. Thanks for any pointers...
Harvey
