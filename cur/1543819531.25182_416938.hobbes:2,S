Oops, I forgot that was there!
Sorry.
Yup, I'm fine with leaving that out.  After all, nothing in the
non-debugging patchset allows userspace to clone the utsnamespace yet,
so it's tough to argue that leaving out that switch impacts
functionality :)
I believe Dave is working on a more acceptable sysctl adaptation, though
I'm not sure when he'll have a patch to submit.  In any case, one clear
concise piece at a time.
thanks,
