Yes. Something like mailman's approach, perhaps? (You set a password when you 
subscribe, then you can see and change which modules you are subscribed to 
using that password.)

You would still have that feature: my script was intended to take patches, 
filenames or modulenames as input, and list the interested parties and/or 
module names.
So...
$ cclist -m big_patch
fs/devfs
arch/x86
$ cclist -f fs/devfs/base.c
Richard Gooch <...>
Al Viro <...>

And tracking of filename<->module relationships, allowing you to look up who 
would be interested in a given patch.

In the way I'm suggesting, it just simplifies matters a little: rather than 
having to list RG and AV separately for every single file in devfs, just say 
"this new file is part of devfs" and it "inherits" them that way.
