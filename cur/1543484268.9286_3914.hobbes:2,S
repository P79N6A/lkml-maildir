I just picked up a Cyrix Cx486SRx2 386 to 486 upgrade chip for $5 to play
around with.  From what I remember this chip has a 1K cache which has to be
turned on by a driver.  I also remember seeing a patch for enabling the
cache on this chip on some FTP site a long time ago.  Does anybody know if
this patch has been incorporated into the new kernel?  If not I may wip up a
new patch myself.
