The latest NTFS driver (2.1.5a) is now available for Linux kernel
2.4.23.
This updated release for Linux kernel 2.4.23 also includes a fix for a
problem encountered by at least two Windows XP users when accessing
certain fragmented files.
As always you can download a patch for the kernel from our website:
	
http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/downloads.html
Or you can pull the changes from our bitkeeper repository:
	
http://linux-ntfs.bkbits.net/ntfs-2.4
Note that the latest NTFS version (2.1.5) is also present in the current 2.6.0-test kernel and has been since 2.6.0-test9.
Happy NTFSing!  (-:
Best regards,
