Ok, I'm not too clued up with recent hardware and the BIOS programming 
that goes with it (being a system admin/application programmer), what 
exactly is usb-handoff?  acpi=off obviously just turns all acpi support 
in the kernel off.  SCI is also a new abbreviation I haven't seen 
before.  Whilst I've seen SMM before, I'm not sure what it stands for (I 
assume it's something to do with simulation of legacy devices for older 
operating systems)?
 From the kernel-parameters documentation:
usb-handoff [HW] Enably early USB BIOS -> OS handoff
I guess this means the OS takes over control of the USB devices at an 
earlier stage than usual - possibly before ACPI gets initialised?  I'm 
unable to determine much from looking at drivers/pci/quirks.c (which is 
where the usb-handoff parameter is defined).
usb-handoff=1 does however also fix the problem.  Ok.  This makes it 
even more confusing (and probably more complicated).  The appropriate 
section from dmesg that shows that it is working correctly:
i8042_init()
ACPI: PS/2 Keyboard Controller [KBC0] at I/O 0x60, 0x64, irq 1
ACPI: PS/2 Mouse Controller [MSE0] at irq 12
i8042_controller_init()
i8042_flush()
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 20 -> i8042 (command) [4]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 47 <- i8042 (return) [4]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 60 -> i8042 (command) [4]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 56 -> i8042 (parameter) [4]
i8042_check_aux()
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: Interrupt 12, without any data [8]
i8042_flush()
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: d3 -> i8042 (command) [13]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: 5a -> i8042 (parameter) [13]
drivers/input/serio/i8042.c: a5 <- i8042 (return) [13]
i8042_check_aux:  passed
So as with acpi=off, we get a correct return.  Now that usb is 
mentioned, I think either myself or Sebastian has mentioned that the 
keyboard does not work unless USB1.1 support is compiled in.  Another 
clue possibly?
Another question - would it be usefull at all to see what happens if the 
AUX_LOOP test is never performed but only AUX_TEST?  Or does AUX_TEST 
rely on the fact that AUX_LOOP must first fail/timeout somehow?
