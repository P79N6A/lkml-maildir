Ehh..
I only said the _naming_ makes sense. [ Wild hand-waving ]
I suspect that what happened was that we split off the functions (one to
just get the page, one to lock it), and the comment that was associated
with the original "find_page()" never got removed, and just happens to sit
above one of the helper functions now - the one that didn't lock.
I'll fix the comment.
