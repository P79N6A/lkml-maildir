I think we need to pass in the same start-end here as well.  Without it,
the first invalidate_range would have to block faulting for all addresses
and would need to remain blocked until the last invalidate_range has
completed.  While this would work, (and will probably be how we implement
it for the short term), it is far from ideal.
Thanks,
