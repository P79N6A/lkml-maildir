We know exactly how far to defer that collapsing, too.
We know at what rate we rotate through the active list,
and the size of the active list.
We also know the rate at which we reclaim pages, and
the size of the inactive list.
Combine the two, and you have an idea roughly how many
page faults there are between the accesses to the coldest
page on the active list.
We don't have to keep the evicted page history beyond
that point, because pages that get refaulted after such
a long interval have a longer inter-reference distance
and should go onto the inactive list - ie. the default
list for unknown pages.

True, but I've looked through a few hundred VM bugzillas
to validate the design against all the common corner cases,
all the way from RHEL3 (which also has split anon/file
lists) through today.
I'm trying to keep the known-good bits of our policy as
much as possible, introducing big changes only for those
corner cases that plagued multiple VMs in the past.
