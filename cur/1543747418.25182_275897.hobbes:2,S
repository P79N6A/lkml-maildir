Tested by me on 2.6.10-rc2-bk<something> as well.  It needed some
trivial adaptions to the tty layer changes done by Linus compared
to the old 2.6.9 version.  I'm pretty confident it wouldn't break
anything, but as it is to big to be classified as ObviouslyCorrect[tm]
fix it probably should not go to into 2.6.10 but be merged in the
2.6.11 cycle.
