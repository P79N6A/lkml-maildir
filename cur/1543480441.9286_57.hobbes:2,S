It's in the code, and apparently usually works. There are some reports,
though, about failures of the most recent kernel to autodetect more than
64MB of RAM  (e.g. MSI 6120N motherboard).
BTW - recent versions of 2.0.X kernel alreay include this feature (but
still fail with some motherboards, e.g. the one above).
