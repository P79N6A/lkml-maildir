Dual-licensing the code and leaving to forked developpements the choice of
the license (dual being candidate) is not very different, in my opinion,
as using the license suggested (or required for BSD) for each O/S,
regarding fairness about porting BSD code to Linux and vice-versa. It just
makes the Linux version more free that the Linux project actually would
want it to be, and may-be it is quite equivalent for BSD projects. 
If Linus is ok with such dual-licensing then this can only be fine for me
too. :)  I just prefer simplest schemes when it is possible.
(Btw, some part of the aic7xxx driver have been so dual-licenced by Justin
Gibbs, for example, IIRC)
