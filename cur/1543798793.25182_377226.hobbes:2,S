First, stick to rt2500 as you won't get help with binary only drivers
here.
Try to reproduce the problem from the console, you're more likely to get
a usable Oops.
Check the driver code & make sure it can't get stuck looping in the
interrupt handler due to an unhandled IRQ.  Add printks.
Finally report it to the rt2500 maintainer.
