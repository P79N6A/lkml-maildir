Hardware is CORRECTLY reporting electrical disconnects,
but Philip is wanting Linux to ignore those reports.

No patch possible.  Reading the other messages in that
thread, Philip is advocating Linux ignore the USB spec.
(Which is what _he_ appears to have been doing...)
What he has to do is more than submit a patch.  He first
needs to lobby the USB-IF to change the USB spec, and
get every peripheral vendor to stop shipping USB devices
and instead switch over to "Philip-USB".  Then get all
the billions of USB peripherals to go into the recycle
bin and be replaced with products conforming to his
new variant.  It all seems highly unlikely.  ;)
But yes, you're right ... if he's serious about
changing all that stuff, he also needs stop being a
member of the "never submitted a USB patch" club.
Ideally, starting with small things.
