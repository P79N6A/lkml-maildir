I don't think you know what a PCI domain is ...

There's still one spinlock that protects *all* accesses to PCI config
space.  Maybe we should make it one per PCI root bridge or something,
but even that wouldn't help some architectures.

To be honest, I think just scaling PARALLEL to NR_CPUS*4 or something
would be a reasonable way to go.
If people actually want to get serious about this, I know the PPC folks
have some openfirmware call that tells them about power domains and how
many scsi discs they can spin up at one time (for example).  Maybe
that's not necessary; if we can figure out what the system's max power
draw is and how close we are to it, we can decide whether to spawn
another thread or not.
It's quite complicated.  You can spin up a disc over *here*, but not
over *there* ... this really is a gigantic can of worms being opened.
