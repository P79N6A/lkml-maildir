Physical power dependencies are a very bus and platform specific matter.
I don't expect to see much core level help or infustructure.  I think in
the PCI case, we would first require PCI bus power management support.
This feature is currently nonexistent.  As I understand, PCI express links
are capable of handling much of this at the hardware level, so it's not
especially important for newer hardware.
At the moment, I think the biggest X86 pm dependency issue is ACPI power
resources.
Logical dependencies might be another matter.  For example, if we have a
bus-instance structure at the driver core level, it may make sense to 
call some sort of ->prepare_for_children mechansim before starting up a
child device.
Thanks,
Adam
