As i mentioned in the previous mail, disbanding all the namespaces of a
user will not disband his mount tree, because a mirror of the mount tree
still continues to exist in /share/$USER in the admin namespace.
And a new user session can always use this copy to create a namespace
that  looks identical to that which existed earlier.

Arn't there ways to escape chroot jails? Serge had pointed me to a URL
which showed chroots can be escaped. And if that is true than having all
user's private mount tree in the same namespace can be a security issue?
