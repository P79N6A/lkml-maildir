'lo,
I'm trying to set up some 2.4 boxes to work behind a Crisco local
director in funky ARP mode, which requires disabling ARPs on the boxes. 
Unfortunately, "ifconfig eth0 -arp" turns off ARP use for gateway
resolution, which I'd like to keep if possible.
I notice there is "arptable" support in netfilter now, but I don't see
any instructions on how to use it.  Would this do what I want, or is
there something else?  I'd prefer to not have to patch the kernel.
