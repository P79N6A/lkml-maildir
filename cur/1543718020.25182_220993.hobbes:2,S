Well it's a question of whether we're likely to see increasing demand for
it in the future.  If so then it would be prudent to put some effort into
fixing it up rather than removing it.
Seems that's not the case.  I don't see a huge rush on this but if after
this discussion nobody steps up to take care of the code over the next few
weeks, it's best to remove it.
