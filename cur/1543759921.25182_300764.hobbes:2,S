Hi all,
 thanks for your comments, because this why i've waited for long time when i
post the first version of the driver. I didn't post another patch on the lkml
because i want to fix the v4l2 layer before another round. I want (if
possible) to remove or deprecated a lot of ioctl in favor of sysfs and v4l2
API. Some ugly kmalloc need to be remove (the last thing of the plugins
architecture) and this:

Can you help me about this 64bits problems ? i've now a amd64 and the webcam
works fine. But perhaps i need to test with a 32 bits app?
