Hi, i worked on this problem a little bit more today, the following
patch makes jstest usable for me:

     for (i = 0; i < buttons; i++)
-        printf("%s%s", i > 0 ? ", " : "", button_names[btnmap[i] - BTN_MISC]);
+        if ((btnmap[i] >= BTN_MISC) && (btnmap[i] < sizeof(btnmap)))

- BTN_MISC]);
     puts(").");
     printf("Testing ... (interrupt to exit)\n");
Now i can see it reports a joystick device of 37 axes and 12 buttons.
Ive played with it for a while and the only events i can trigger are
button 7 8 and 9, for left right and middle mouse button respectively.
All the others dont seem to change.
Btw this is the result of cat /proc/bus/input/devices:

The joystick in question is ofcourse js0, which is registered together
with the mouse.
So, is this hid-input's fault for registering my mouse as a joystick,
my mouse for reporting its a joystick device, or something else?
If its my mouse's fault, is it possible to blacklist it, and use some
kind of quirk to fix this?
Sorry to send this twice, gmail screwed up the no html subpart rule.
