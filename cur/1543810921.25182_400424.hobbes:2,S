Just a random idea, offered with little real understanding
of what's going on ...
  Instead of a per-task clear page, how about a per-cpu clear page,
  or short queue of clear pages?
  This lets the number of clear pages be throttled to whatever
  is worth it.  And it handles such cases as a few threads using
  the clear pages rapidly, while many other threads don't need any,
  with a much higher "average usefulness" per clear page (meaning
  the average time a cleared page sits around wasting memory prior
  to its being used is much shorter.)
  Some locking would still be needed, but per-cpu locking is
  a separate, quicker beast than something like mmap_sem.
Mind you, I am not commenting one way or the other on whether any
of this is a good idea.  Not my expertise ...
