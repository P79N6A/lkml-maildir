This has become a FAQ. Look in /etc/lilo.conf and see what your
system expects to use as a kernel..... like:
boot = /dev/sda
compact
delay = 15	# optional, for systems that boot very quickly
vga = normal	# force sane state
root = current	# use "current" root
image = /vmlinuz   <======   This !!!!
  label = linux
image = /vmlinuz.old
  label = linux_old
other = /dev/sda1
  table = /dev/sda
  label = dos
The, if you made bzImage, copy if from /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/
to overwrite the kernel. If you made zImage, do the same thing.
Then execute `lilo` with no command-line parameters. Yoy can also make
a bootable floppy as:
#
cp /usr/src/linux/System.map /
cp /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage /tmp/vmlinux
ROOTDEV=`df / | cut -d ' ' -f1 | sed -e1d`
echo -n 'Setting root device as ' ; echo ${ROOTDEV}
rdev -R /tmp/vmlinux 1
rdev /tmp/vmlinux ${ROOTDEV}
cp /tmp/vmlinux /dev/fd0 
psupdate
(apologies to those who wrote in the past saying that the parsing 
could be done with only one tool, this copy didn't get updated)
Make the bootable floppy first to see if there is anything wrong with
the kernel. If it boots and mounts your file-system, the kernel is
okay.
The symptoms you describe usually are caused by the last section of
the kernel being messed up during uncompression because the last
portion was not present in the map file, although the other sections
did occupy the same area the overwritten one did.
In other words, you must execute lilo any time you overwrite the
kernel. 
If a bootable-floppy version of you kernel fails to find init, this
looks like something didn't link properly because there were some
old object files in your kernel. Make sure to do `make dep` and
`make clean` before you do `make bzImage`.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
