Subject: [PATCH 0/15] Make common helpers for seq_files that work with list_head-s (v2)

Many places in kernel use seq_file API to iterate over a regular
list_head. The code for such iteration is identical in all the
places, so it's worth introducing a common helpers.
This makes code about 300 lines smaller:

The first version of this patch made the helper functions static inline
in the seq_file.h header. This patch moves them to the fs/seq_file.c as
Andrew proposed. The vmlinux .text section sizes are as follows:
2.6.22-rc1-mm1:              0x001794d5
with the previous version:   0x00179505
with this patch:             0x00179135
The config file used was make allnoconfig with the "y" inclusion of all
the possible options to make the files modified by the patch compile plus
drivers I have on the test node.
