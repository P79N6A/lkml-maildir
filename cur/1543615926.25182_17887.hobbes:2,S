Erm, I don't believe these have been added since you last complained.
I don't see how they became a non-issue and are now a problem.  Please
double-check them.

Some of these are waiting to be dug out of my copy of the Configure.help
file and forwarded to Linus.
The only thing I'm doing at the moment is forwarding the stuff that doesn't
touch ARM specific files; Configure.help is a generic file, so it doesn't
get sent as often, and will always take longer (and therefore be out of
date).
