Hello, 
I want to build kernel to support DiffServ service in
Traffic Control.
I did as following 
......
make rmproper
make xconfig
make dep
make clean
make bzImage
make modules
make modules_install
cp arch/i386/boot/bzImage /boot/bzImage-2.4.26
cp System.map /boot/System.map-2.4.26
and in grub.conf I typed :
title kernel 2.4.26
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-xxx
when I reboot I received a error as follow:
Booting "kernel 2.4.26"
kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.26
Error 15 : File not found 
Can any one help me !
Thanks you very much for help !
