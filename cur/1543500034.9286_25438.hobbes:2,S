Another kind of security level would be to develop kswap alike
processes.
I mean exporting basic process activities in subsidiary kernel
processes.
By the way, I'm currently and _actively_ thinking of it....
What I wanna figure out by now is the way _user space_ allocations are
done
as kmalloc seems only dedicated for _kspace_ ones : /
Another dark question is the way requests would be made :
User->Kernel central or User->Specific Kprocess.
Any arguments for/against those microkernel concepts ?

The interesting statement (and the challenge) is the quote "all other
known paths". If any cunning people out there can think of other,
not-covered ways that root can subvert the kernel, please get in touch
with me, or Alan, or the list etc.
This work isn't relevant to just securelevel - it is vital for
capabilities too.
