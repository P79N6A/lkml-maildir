Great, if you think so, please provide patches to the main kernel tree
for all of us to see.  Just don't try to bury it in a driver subsystem.
That is my complaint.

Isn't it a better idea to try to work with the community, instead of
ignoring them and thinking that you are progressing ahead of them?  :)

For your driver subsystem, possibly.  I know the whole history of ACPI,
and how that is developed too.  Also remember all of the man-hours that
were spent getting that acpi code into the proper shape for Linux...

Again, patches are always appreciated to address anything that you feel
is missing in Linux.

That's good, as you have yet to even submit anything :)

Um, "no one else does it as it is not necessary," is not enough?

Not at all.  Just look at the vast array of different hardware platforms
that Linux runs on!  And look at how almost all drivers work on all of
those platforms with no changes needed!  We are all for portability.

Harder for whom to maintain?  You, or the rest of the kernel community?
Remember, once your code is in the tree, everyone is free to make
changes to it, that's the power of a community effort.
That's enough of this, just submit a patch and we can work from there,
with real, technical answers for specific technical issues.
thanks,
