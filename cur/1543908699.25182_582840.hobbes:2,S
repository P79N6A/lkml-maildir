Yes please.

Just did. :)

Sorry it took so long, but my net access is still a touch intermittent just 
now.  I recently moved back to Austin and we haven't unpacked the wireless 
router yet.  (So although there's internet at home my wife is usually the one 
using it.  I'm out at a wireless laundromat at the moment.  Yes, Austin has 
such things.)

I posted a link to it in the message at the start of this thread:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/9/584
Here's the release announcement for it:

Here's the source control for it:

You need to run the index.html generator first, because the link checker works 
on the html and not on 00-INDEX itself.  Both scripts expect Documentation to 
be a subdirectory of the current directory, and do the whole directory.
And I need to update it so it filters out index.html, but my laundry's 
done. :)
