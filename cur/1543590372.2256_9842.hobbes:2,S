I'm confused by the "lets not use ECC and use bk" talk.
My understanding is suns big machines stopped using ecc and they
started to have "random" problems running big-iron applications
that took them a while to figure out (and a lot of bad press) and can
only be rectified in the big cycle (this was last year so its probably solved 
now).
I thought one of the primary reasons to have ecc is to catch
wierd things before they become catostrophic...and at least
know WHY weirdness is happening...
