I have my channels interconnect graph, nicely exported to sysfs, and I just 
need an interface that an application could use to request connections 
between two nodes of this graph.
The result of the connection is a pipeline object, also exported to sysfs, 
that the application will use to do further work on the connection.
Currently I'm using an ioctl() but, given that ioctls seem to be a no-no for 
future projects, given that there is great effort in having new and better 
interfaces, I'm trying to figure out what is the best way to do what I need.
thanks,
Bye,
