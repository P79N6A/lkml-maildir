This kind of patch has been submitted several times before and it's
never accepted because you have to do much more than this to recover
from the allocation error.
There is no error status returned to the caller, so the callers assume
the operation succeeded, and will either OOPS or crash in some other
way.
Therefore, just adding some NULL pointer checks and returning is not
going to fix this bug.
The whole cahce-multipath subsystem has to have it's guts revamped for
proper error handling.
