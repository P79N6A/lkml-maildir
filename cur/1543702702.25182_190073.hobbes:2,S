Subject: HELP!! 2.6.x build problem with make xconfig

Please don't flame me for missing this if it's already buried in the
archive but I cannot make xconfig, gconfig, or menuconfig with a 2.6.X
kernel.
I am using RH 9.0 with all up2dates (including required packages for
2.6.x kernel build as far as I can tell). Am I missing a symbolic link
or something?
Here's what I do (as root)...
cd /usr/src
rm linux linux-2.4 linux-2.6
tar -zxvf linux-2.6.x.tar.gz
chown -R 0.0 linux-2.6.x
ln -fs linux-2.6.x linux
ln -fs linux-2.4.x linux-2.6    # not sure why I do this anymore
cd /usr/include
rm asm linux scsi
ln -fs /usr/src/linux/include/asm-i386 asm
ln -fs /usr/src/linux/include/linux linux
ln -fs /usr/src/linux/include/scsi scsi
cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.x
make mrproper xconfig

Please help or point me to a FAW or something...
