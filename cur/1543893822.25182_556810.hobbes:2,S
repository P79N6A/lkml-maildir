You should also be obtaining hid-debug dump of usage code -> input mapping 
when the kernel is compiled with CONFIG_HID_DEBUG, just after the report 
descriptor is dumped, something like
drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c: report descriptor (size 55, read 55) = 05 
01 09 02 a1 01 09 01 a1 00 05 09 19 01 29 08 15 00 25 01 75 01 95 08 81 02 
05 01 09 30 09 31 09 38 15 81 25 7f 75 08 95 03 81 06 05 0c 0a 38 02 95 01 
81 06 c0 c0
  INPUT[INPUT]
    Field(0)
      Physical(GenericDesktop.Pointer)
      Usage(8)
        Button.0001
        Button.0002
        Button.0003
        Button.0004
... etc.
Could you please send it to me, it wasn't included in your previous dump 
you sent me?
Thanks,
