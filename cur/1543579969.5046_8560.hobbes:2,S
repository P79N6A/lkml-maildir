I know that some distributions ship .config but not all do.  A long way
down on my TODO list is "submit a requirement to FHS that .config,
System.map and other kernel related text files must be shipped in
directory <foo>".  I would like <foo> to be /lib/modules/`uname -r`
since that directory is already kernel specific, but we have to handle
kernels without modules and disks with restricted size in /lib.
However that discussion is best held on the FHS/LSB lists, not l-k.
