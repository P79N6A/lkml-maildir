Back on May 6th, Nathan Fontenot posted a patch to linuxppc64, that had
this fixed when he noticed it got removed.  It looks like the patch was
never merged.

I pushed a patch to remove the log_error messages from going to the
console by default.  The error logs still should be put in
/proc/ppc64/rtas/error_log for rtas_errd to pick them up and send it to
ELA for decode.  These apps are already done and can be found on IBM's
diagnostic service website.
