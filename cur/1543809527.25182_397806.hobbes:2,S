Hi Nick,
 I believe there is a bug in radix_tree_delete introduced by:
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=d5274261ea46f0aae93820fe36628249120d2f75
The nature of the bug is that if a tag is set on a node that is being
deleted, then that tag is unconditionally cleared in the parent of the
node, even if the deleted node has siblings with the tag still set.
I don't know what the large-scale consequences of this bug might be,
but I'm kinda hoping fixing it will fix a nasty NFS client related
oops we are seeing in radix_tree_tag_set ....
My suggested patch is below.
Please review, confirm, and Ack:
Thanks,
NeilBrown
