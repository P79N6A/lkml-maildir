No.  I'm talking about the userlevel side, not kernel side.
If a thread is canceled *after* it returns from the syscall but before
it reports the event to the call (i.e., while still in the syscall
wrapper, thread cancellation rules require a check there) the event is
lost.
Linus was only talking about the kernel side and how in the exit path
such events are not lost.
