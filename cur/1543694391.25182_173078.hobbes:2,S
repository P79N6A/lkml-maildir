I think the confusion has arisen because I said that you can't
compress N values in to <N values.  This is somewhat ambiguous, and
can be taken to mean either:
1. You can't loss-lessly compress N arbitrary values, in to less than
N arbitrary values using a certain mathematical transformation.
or
2. You can't loss-lessly compress all N combinations of M bits, in to
less than M bits, using any mathematical transformation.
Obviously interpretation 1 is incorrect, and interpretation 2 is
correct.
John.
