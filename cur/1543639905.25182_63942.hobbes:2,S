I am looking at the linux kernel code. The driver in /drivers/char/agp uses
this same seqeuence to allocate non-cacheable memory page ( look at the
function static int agp_generic_create_gatt_table(void)).
I will give it a try on my mips based platform and let you guys know the
outcome.
Thanks to everyone for all the responses and guidance.
Imran.

Won't work around hardware limitations.  If the hardware
cannot turn off caching, all you could do is flush the
page to ram before every explicit IO request...
