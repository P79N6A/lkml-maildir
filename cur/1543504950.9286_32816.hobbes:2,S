We're running Linux 2.2.9 on a Samba, Imap, Sendmail, DNS, Web, etc.,
server for over 100 users.  The system usually runs fine, but has been
crashing quite often recently.   The machine completely locks and no
longer responds to pings when the problem happens.  It's a Dell
Poweredge with the MegaRAID PERC controllers.  We have 512MB Ram on it
and have notched up the number of file handles and some other buffer
related information in order to speed up the Samba server.
We've got an automated user, called report, that logs in to the server,
and retrieves items from the sent folder (which is 280 MB in size), and
sends and receives messages quite often.  This imapd process can grow to
very huge sizes. After running top on the server, it seems that the
system tends to crash when trying to get the messages from that folder.  
After a couple of crashes, I telnetted into the system and ran vmstat to
get an idea of what's going on.  The output right before the crash is
below:
Does anyone have any hints or ideas to avoid these crashes?  We're
thinking of moving everything over to an IBM AIX RS/6000 machine (at
least for the report user) if we can't find a solution to this
problem.   
If you reply, please CC me, since I cannot always follow the linux
kernel mailing list.  Thanks.
