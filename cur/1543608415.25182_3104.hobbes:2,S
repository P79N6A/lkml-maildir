I have a different problem with this figures. Shouldn't
Active+Inactive+Cached+Buffers+MemFree == MemTotal?
In fact I was about to also post a cat of meminfo because
I'm having really poor interactive perfomance on my G4-500
with 2.4.14-pre5-ben0 and I think it's memory related. The
problems weren't that bad a few subreleases ago.

All the machine is running right now is the GNOME desktop, a mailreader
and a webbrowser as well as 4 terminals.
