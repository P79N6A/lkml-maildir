There is more sad stuff involved with drivers assuming IO ports fit in
int. A proper fix for 2.6.23 will be the rework of PIO allocation I'm
doing. A temporary fix for 2.6.22 would be for Olof to use
reserve_phb_iospace() to make sure his PIO gets in the low 31 bits. We
need to add a spinlock to it though.
