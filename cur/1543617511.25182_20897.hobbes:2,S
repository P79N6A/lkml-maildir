No, noone 'maintains' it; I actually /meant/ search.
So if you run it on a Redhat distribution, it goes queries
redhat first, then lists
  IBM T23 - Alex Bligh
  IBM T23 new version - Rob Landley
...
etc.
IE is the minimum amount of automation to simulate typing the thing
into google. (the advantage of doing this over using google
alone is that X may not be working at this stage and lynx
might daunt Aunt Tillie).
Obviously you will need some magic tag at the top of a config
file to make it easilly identifiable to search engines. And no
doubt some fools will fill files with crap.

Correct; I'm sure the probing configurator has a place too.

No, to be honest. However, now you have set me the challenge, I'll
report back on how well or otherwise it works.

Well, you'd wait until either your distro vendor had done one, or
someone else had posted one and it had reached search-engine
du-jour.

True.

Perhaps you are right.

Sure I agree, if it works; my speculation is that it doesn't, if one
boots with a default vendor kernel, on many machines. I would love
to be proved wrong, so rather than debate further here, I have another
T23 to set up so I'll boot it up from scratch, run the configurator,
and see what happens.
