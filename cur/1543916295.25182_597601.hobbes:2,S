 +  THR -- a threshold interrupt happens, when frequency of ECC memory
 +  corrections is too high. Threshold interrupt machinery is often put
 +  into the ECC hardware, and must be explicitly enabled, if so. Occasional
 +  ECC memory corrections are part of the normal operation (ionizing radiation
 +  background). Sequences of ECC corrections or outright failures over some
 +  short interval, usually indicate a memory chip, that is about to fail
 +  completely.
(that "random alpha particles" bs, must be killed anyway)

> +  when the temperature drops back to normal.

 +  SPU -- a spurious interrupt. This is an interrupt, that was raised then lowered
 +  so quickly, that it was not fully processed by the APIC.  Hence,
 +  origin of it is unknown.
 +  For this case, interrupt with a IRQ vector of 0xff will be generated.

 +  RES, CAL, TLB -- rescheduling, call and tlb flush interrupts,
 +  produced by normal OS operation.  Typically,
 +  this information is used by kernel developers and interested users to
 +  determine the occurance of interrupt floods of the given type.
