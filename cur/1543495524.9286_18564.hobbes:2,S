Phillip, could you try it out:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel/2.2.8_andrea1.bz2
under heavy web load? (should run fine on alpha too as far as stock-2.2.8
is just fine too)
Note: it has also my wake-one on accept that just address completly the
overscheduling problem. But to achieve performances by it you must make
sure that _all_ apache tasks are sleeping in accept(2) and not in
flock(2)/fcntl(2)/whatever. Maybe you'll need to patch apache to achieve
that (I also seen a patch floating on the list, maybe you only need to
grap such patch and apply/reverse it over the apache tree).
I would like if you would make comparison with a clean 2.2.8 (or with
pre-2.3.1 even if I have not seen it yet).
