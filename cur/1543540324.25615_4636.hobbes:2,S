Do you mean /usr/src/linux/drivers ?  If so, I think it's a reasonable
idea as well but it would seem that this heirarchy itself could use some
reorganzation.  For instance, there are directories for block and char,
yet other block and character devices live outside these directories.
Why is this new heirarchy required for your boot disks?  Couldn't you
make your own heirarchy within, say, an XML file for your application?
