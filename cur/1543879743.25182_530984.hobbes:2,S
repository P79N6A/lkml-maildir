The extant plugsched patches have nothing to do with cfs; I suspect
what everyone else is going on about is terminological confusion. The
4-year-old sample policy with scheduling classes for the original
plugsched is something you had no way of knowing about, as it was never
publicly posted. There isn't really anything all that interesting going
on here, apart from pointing out that it's been done before.
