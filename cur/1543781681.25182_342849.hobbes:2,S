Actually, you don't need to unterstand much about the boot process, just
pretend you're /bin/sh and execute whatever is defined in /etc/inittab :-).
So I found the culprit to be a call to /usr/bin/sensors -s in one of the
init scripts. I disabled the script for the time being (no big loss, the
sensors reported complete junk unter 2.6.8, anyway).
