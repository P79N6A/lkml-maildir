I believe it's a useful interface, but should be programmatical (e.g.
fixing fsync(MS_INVALIDATE)).
This is because:
a) This interface may find good use in databases; it's more-or-less what
   they truly need when they keep asking for `raw devices'
b) It's trivial to write a small proggy that will use it and be useful in
   shell scripts
