We have some strange race conditions as a result of the timer
scalability fixes.
ptype_all is set to 0x10:0x10 on faster systems (Xeon 3.6Ghz).
Slower systems do fine(Xeon 3.0Ghz) and do not corrupt ptype_all.
Its not clear to me how ptype_all could relate to timer operations but
if I apply these timer patches I get ptype_all corruption.

timers-fixes-improvements-fix.patch
timer-deadlock-fix
(It does not matter if the last three are applied)
I put some printk's in an get the following output (2.6.12-rc4 + patches):
net_dev_init: ptype_all = c0569e20:c0569e20
Machine check exception polling timer started.
