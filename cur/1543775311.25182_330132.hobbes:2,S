Here are results:
manual actions (i mean manual echo to protocol..): perfect
i tought resetafter param could restart the driver and set to a lower
protocol, but doesn't.
i see in dmesg that it only ask for resync after $resetafter value i
set.
using proto=auto, it always set synaptics protocol, even with plugged
mouse.
would be nice and automatic protocol up/down, maybe helped by resetafter
or another parameter 
for example:
"checkafter" that recheck configuration every xxx seconds and change
protocol.
Good /sys work however 
I'm ready to test any changement, just notice me.
