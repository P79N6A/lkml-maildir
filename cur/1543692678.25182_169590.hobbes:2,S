In 2.6.0-test6-mm1 with OSS emulation I encountered a problem where xine
would use the sound card in OSS mode and no other application would be
able to use it after that until I rebooted. Do any of these fixes
address this problem?
By the way - something you folks did during -test5 improved the quality
of snd-intel8x0 by leaps and bounds. It used to crackle a lot at certain
frequencies and works great now. :)
Thanks,
