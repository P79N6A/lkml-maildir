If this f_count/file_count cleanup really has to go in, instead of moving
the Coda code from flush to release, use the attached patch which simply
removes last_close semantics from the kernel. This way I'll have to deal
with an upcall for every close, but  I can try to track the open count
in our userspace cachemanager and do the last writer thing up there.
I would rather take the performance hit than lose the possibility to
return meaningful errors on close.
