Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Mechanism to turn of ASR on a per-ELF binary basis
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/23/150

These patches allow the binaries which absolutely require that
their address space layout to be unaffected by address space
randomisation to specify that in their ELF header.
The first part defines the ELF header flag, the second implements
the corresponding part of the interpreter functionality.
regards, Samium Gromoff
