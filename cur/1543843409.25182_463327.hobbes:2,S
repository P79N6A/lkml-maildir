I hope you do realize that this a rather selfish point of view. The zero 
maintainance overhead is a myth, only because _you_ don't have to do it.
OTOH maintaining the trace points along with the corresponding source is 
a barely noticable noise and is certainly less work than having them to 
maintain separately.

Sorry, but you're not the only one with actual experience and in my 
experience the value far outweighs the occasional need for adjustments. If 
you don't use them, they are of course a nuisance, but is your personal 
dislike really reason enough to deny others a useful tool?

Ingo, maybe you should try to understand the point I'm trying to make?
You mostly emphasize your personal dislike of static tracepoints.

Sorry, but I fail to see the point you're trying to make (beside your 
personal preferences), none of this is a unsolvable problem, which would 
prevent making good use of static tracepoints.

Static tracepoints don't have to be implemented via alternatives and
you continue to ignore that kprobes are nontrivial, you continue to ignore 
that both can coexist just fine. You just want to force your personal 
preferences onto others. :-(

Sorry, I don't understand this point. Ptrace support would match kernel 
gdb support, which would be a complete different discussion...

_This_ discussion is about a core set of trace points! Yes, you can have 
thousands of trace points in drivers, but they don't have to be enabled by 
default and are no reason at all against a few core trace point, which 
can be used by _all_ archs to trace core events as _cheaply_ as possible.

Huh? How exactly do static tracepoints prevent you from doing this?
Different problems require different solutions, nobody is taking Kprobes 
away, but why should Kprobes be the only solution?
