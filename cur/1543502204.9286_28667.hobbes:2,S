I believe that this is only a temporary measure - as far as I understand it
they are moving away from UFS as fast as they can. The filesystem supposed to
be that standard in MacOS X is HFS+, which supports resource forks as well as
file names consisting of up to 255 Unicode characters. I am already scared by
the interoperability problems this will produce, as 255 Unicodes encoded in
UTF-8 will not fit in normal Unix file name limits.
