exactly; this is why I've been pushing recently for each new LSM to at
least document and make explicit what it tries to protect / protect
against (threat model and defense model in traditional security terms).
Without such an explicit description it's both impossible to
"neutrally" review a proposed LSM towards its goals, and it ends up as
a result with people making assumptions and attacking the model because
there's no separation between code and model.

again I agree pretty much; I do want to reserve some minimum "common
sense" bar because people may (and probably will) do silly things withs
LSMs that are really not the right thing to do objectively.
