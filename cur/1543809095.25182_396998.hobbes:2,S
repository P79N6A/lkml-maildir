Yes, indeed.  It is Acer Travelmate 230 and it is using
'acpi_sleep=s3_bios'.  The bug report noted though that the
following showed up:
Yenta O2: res at 0x94/0xD4: 00/ca
Yenta O2: enabling read prefetch/write burst
    ACPI-0265: *** Error: No installed handler for fixed event [00000002]
which was not something which I have seen before and indeed on
another laptop with the same kernel is absent.  But it was also not
there on 230 with earlier kernels.
BTW - this another laptop mentioned above, which happens to be Acer
Travelmate 740, is doing suspend/resume with 2.6.15 kernel, and no
'acpi_sleep=s3_bios' is needed,  but shortly after such cycle both
an external mouse and a touchpad go crazy and a mouse pointer
refuses to move in X from the left screen edge.  Not very useful and
so far I did not found a way to reset rodents.  No problems of that
sort before I will try to suspend.  Always something "interesting".
It is actually possible that in this case this is a problem with
"ATI Radeon Mobility M6" video driver which gets upset by suspend
(or some other pieces driving display) but I do not really know.
