Note that without your patch, the permitted set is maintained, so that
you can regain the caps into your effective set after setuid if you
need.  i.e.
	prctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS, 1);
	setresuid(1000, 1000, 1000);
	caps = cap_from_text("cap_net_admin,cap_sys_admin,cap_dac_override=ep");
	ret = cap_set_proc(caps);
So this patch will change the default behavior, but does not add
features or change what is possible.
Ordinarely I'd say changing default behavior wrt security is a bad
thing, but given that this is "default behavior when doing prctl(PR_SET_KEEPCAPS)",
I don't know how much it matters.
Still, I like the current behavior, where setuid means drop effective
caps no matter what.
