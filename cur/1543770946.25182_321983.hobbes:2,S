Some DocBook-related comments and questions:
* "make psdocs" and "make pdfdocs" both fail in current tree, on Fedora 
Core 2 (FC2) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (RHEL4).  Strangely enough, 
they fail on different files.  I've attached output-psdocs.txt and 
output-pdfdocs.txt showing the errors I get.
Both psdocs and pdfdocs -do- work for some files.  Each target proceeds 
for a bit, and then finds a specific file it doesn't like, and dies. 
100% reproducible.
In each failing case, I can use "db2ps" or "db2pdf" to successfully 
convert the XML file, whereas xmlto fails.
* Can you make it easy to change the paper size to something custom, 
like 6x9in ?
* Is there an example somewhere describing how to insert graphics 
(figures and charts) ?
Regards and thanks,
	Jeff
