Subject: Is it possible to get the return address in a system call function?

Let me clarify with an example: 
test.c:
******
open("abc.txt", O_RDONLY);
i ++;
Apparently, after the system call  "open" in the kernel, the system
will return to the instruction "i++".  My question is: can we find out
the instruction pointer in  sys_open? If so, how?
Thanks!
