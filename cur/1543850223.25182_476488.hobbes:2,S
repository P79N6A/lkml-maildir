OK. Looking at the current git snapshot:
current_now is missing.
time_remainig should be split into:
  time_to_empty_now
  time_to_empty_avg
  time_to_full
or even
  time_to_empty_now
  time_to_empty_avg
  time_to_full_now
  time_to_full_avg
s/charge_count/cycle_count/, that's the standard name and used by the SBS spec.
Why the reversed order, for example, in design_charge vs. charge_last?
Following hwmon style, I think it should be
s/design_charge/charge_design/
s/manufacture_date/date_manufactured/
s/first_use/date_first_used/
s/design_voltage/voltage_design/
s/charge_last/charge_last_full/ seems less ambiguous.
s/^charge$/charge_left/ follows SBS and seems better.
And, for the reasons I explained earlier, I strongly suggest not using
the term "charge" except when referring to the action of charging.
Hence:
s/charge_rate/rate/;  s/charge/capacity/
It would be nice to have power_{now,avg}, always in mW regardless of
the capacity units.
I take it you don't want to deal with battery control actions for now.

I think using one set of files and units string makes more sense, for
several reasons:
Reduces the number of attributes and kernel code duplication.
Can handle weird power sources that use other units.
Simpler userspace code. One can do
$ cd /sys/foo; echo `cat capacity_left` out of `cat capacity_last`
`cat capaity_units` left.
instead of checking multiple sets of files for valid values.
The great majority of apps don't care about the physical values, but
just need something that they can parse as a relative quantity and
something to show the user. The generic units scheme provides both. We
have current_*, voltage etc. for those that do care, but there's no
need to duplicate the whole set of _thresholds, _last_full, _design
etc.
