Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.4 breaks VMware
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Despite VMware's webpage claiming compatibility issues with 2.4.x kernels I'd
been using it without any problem until I upgraded to 2.4.4.  I couldn't use
their precompiled modules of course but compiling to match the running kernel
worked fine previously.
This patch replaces a wee bit of code vmware wanted in include/linux/skbuff.h
although I'm guessing it was removed for a reason and vmware should be patched
to use the new method.
