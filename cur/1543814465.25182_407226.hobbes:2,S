Well, we were discussing this with you some time ago, and you pointed me
to these raw functions. My stuff just does not fit device/driver/bu
modes and you said I have to create whatever sysfs hierarchy I want with
the raw functions.
kobject_register()/kobject_del() instead of
sysfs_create_dir()/sysfs_remove_dir() solved my problem, thanks. Just to
refine this, I'm still going to use
sysfs_create_file()/sysfs_remove_file() to create whatever attributes I
want, is this right?
I've just noticed similarity in naming: sysfs_remove_file() creates a
file, so the symmetrical sysfs_create_dir() creates a directory. So just
started using it. From the names it was not obvious that I could
not. :-)
Thanks.
