Subject: [patch] updated preemptive kernel for 2.4.21
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I put an updated preempt-kernel patch up at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel/v2.4/
The patch is a rediff to 2.4.21, but also contains a number of fixes for
preempt-unsafe code -- both longstanding issues and new problems arising
from the 2.4.21 development cycle. Thanks to Joe Korty and various folks
at MontaVista for a lot of the fixes.
Please give it a whirl. Or, even better, switch to 2.5
Enjoy,
	Robert Love
