No, I think this will catch the "hang" but look in sysfs in
/sys/modules/ for the module directory for the module that "failed" to
be loaded.  I think you will see some dangling files there that are
incorrect, and might oops if you cat from them (don't remember).
Kay's patch is correct and fixes the reference count issue properly,
this one just papers over it by ignoring the fact that the driver is
never released and cleaned up in memory.
(patch included below so Kay can verify this...)
thanks,
