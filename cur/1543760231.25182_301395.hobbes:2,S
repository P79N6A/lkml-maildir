There are three ways we can do this:
a) all 2.6.x.y are diffs against 2.6.x
b) interdiffs for .1, .2, etc. with 2.6.x+1 diffed against 2.6.x
c) interdiffs and 2.6.12 is a diff against 2.6.11.last
Imagine we want to go from 2.6.11.3 to 2.6.12
case a)
revert patch 2.6.11.3
get and apply 2.6.12
case b)
revert patch 2.6.11.3
revert patch 2.6.11.2
revert patch 2.6.11.1
get and apply 2.6.12
case c)
poke around on kernel.org and figure out that the last kernel in .11 is .11.5
get and apply 2.6.11.4
get and apply 2.6.11.5
get and apply 2.6.12
Note this gets increasingly more painful in cases b and c when there
are a large number of post-releases. And case c) is really stupid when
you want to go from 2.6.12 to 2.6.11.
Also note that -pre, -rc, -bk, -mm, -ac, and every other branch off a
release has worked the a) way.
