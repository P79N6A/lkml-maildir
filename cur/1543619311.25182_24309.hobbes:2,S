This is great! Thanks to Greg for testing and providing feedback.

You have a PCI device that is the USB controller. You create a child of 
that represents the USB bus. Then, devices are added as children of that.
Logically, couldn't you skip that extra layer of indirection and make USB 
devices children of the USB controller? Or, do you see benefit in the 
explicit distinction?

(To everyone else)
Note this change: This patch removed struct iobus, so that everything 
becomes a device and only a device. A 'bus' is simply a device that has 
children. 
This concept is something that I have argued both for and against since I 
started on this. Initially, the goal was to separate the two because they 
followed such different semantics. 
But, I've found it, IMO, it creates more problems than it solves. There 
was/is a lot of code replication just because you want to do the same 
thing to each object, but have two different pointer types to deal with. 
And, it's quite easy to add extra semantics for devices that have 
children.
