Nice wordplay. The insignificant problem I was speaking to was finding
developers to work on a project housing the source for the Linux kernel.
That's it. You'll never hear me state that source management is a simple
problem to solve. You're simply being argumentative.
From the sounds of things, Aegis provides a baseline set of functionality
that will be necessary for management of kernel revisions. So does yours.
So, for the task at hand, what directly-necessary features do you bring to
the table, that make up for your inability to carry on a conversation with
people without becoming insulting?

Is this the "supporting at commercial levels" that we can expect?

Once again (speaking only for myself), I don't give a damn if you make a
dime off your product. I work on open source projects for my own
amusement. If you happen to find a way to make money doing it, more power
to you. But don't expect me to care about your psuedo-open-source
product's bottom line. Especially because I haven't seen compelling
evidence posted to this forum to convince me that your product is a better
offering -FOR THE TASK AT HAND- than something else, and since your
product is vapor, I can't even check for myself. And your arrogance and
posturing certainly helps one make up their mind.
Considering that you're trying to sell this product to the people here
(even if it's free), maybe you should try a different marketing approach?

Everything has a cost.

No, I'm going to suggest that your profit-driven rationale is of little
importance to some people here. Most people just want a system that works;
justify it in terms of what it can do, and people will listen.
Justify it in terms of how bad everyone else's products are, or in terms
of how much money you need to make to support it, and at least a few of us
will find you to simply be petty.

You'll note that I never once claimed that. I'm simply speaking to your
attack on a competing project, and one which is being held up to have a
similar feature spread to yours, with a license which is more palatable to
some of us.

None. I've neither used your product, nor Peter's; my source management
experience is via RCS, SCCS, and CVS, along with in-house tools. Again,
I've also never claimed that either system is better, nor have I claimed
expertise with either one. I've simply stated that you've belittled him
for even daring to speak on the subject regarding his offering because he 
is not providing commercial support for the product.
A rational discussion is what I was hoping to see when the first posting
was made on the subject. In under 10 postings, it's degraded into a series
of insults, and most of them certainly seemed to eminate from you (Peter
certainly egged you on in a couple of places, but the reaction was far
from civil for this forum).
