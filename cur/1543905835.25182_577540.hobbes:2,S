Subject: [PATCH] balance_dirty_pages - exit loop when no more pages available
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

exit loop in balance_dirty_pages when no more pages available to write
On a bdi that has very little traffic balance_dirty_pages can loop
needlessly waiting until do_writepages has written enough pages.
do_writepages will return encountered_congestion==0 && nr_to_write > 0 
when it has completed a pass but did not find enough pages available to
write. balance_dirty_pages ignores this and keeps looping until a total
of chunk pages was written. 
this patch adds an extra exit condition to break out of the loop in this
case. 
I've tested this on my amd64 desktop, and I also have a version of this
patch that includes a printk and a test case that occasionally does
trigger this condition.
