I think that we shouldn't kill update in 2.2.x. I bet many people will
continue to run it and they will harm performances.
There is _no_ one good point in killing update other than saving some page
of memory for the update task (kernel stack and some minor thing).

I never run with your changes applyed but reading some spare email I bet
the problem is that tasks are getting stuck in mark_dirty_buffer(), I
think for some reason they don't get a wakeup correctly.

I don't understand exactly why you talk about noatime...

What is this backlog problem?

It's due a bug in ext2fs and you triggered it. I noticed it too some time
ago and I fixed it (here it is the obviously right fix ready for
2.2.9/2.3.1).

In this your patch you have not tried to return to give a sense to
bh->flushtime. And now you'll also flush all dirty buffers every interval.
