Yes.  The bio layer does two operations on sg elements: clustering and
virtual merging.  Clustering tries to coalesce two adjacent I/O pages
that also happen to be adjacent in memory physical space.  virtual
merging uses an IOMMU to place non-physically-adjacent pages at adjacent
locations in bus physical space.

That's what the jury is out on, I think.  The question is could we
improve the chances of clustering by altering the way the vm allocator
works.
