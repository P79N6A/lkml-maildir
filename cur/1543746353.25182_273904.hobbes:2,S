Use the profile_hit() stuff to register a new profiling type for the
slab allocations you're interested in, then the offending allocators
should show up close to the top there unless there is a lot of turnover.
In that case, fiddling with the profiling and slab code to unregister
hits from whoever allocated a buffer should get solid results.
