Subject: [PATCH] via82cxxx recording bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This fixes a recording problem that I experienced
on an Asus CUV4X mainboard (via686a + cs4299 rev D).
Recording resulted in bad noise when using frags
smaller than a page size (either using default params
with low sample rate or explicit with
SNDCTL_DSP_SETFRAGMENT ioctl).
Some apps that use the sound card (eg, gnomemeeting)
were completely useless.
Patch is against 2.4.19-pre1.
Jeff, I'll appreciate if you could give it at least a
visual inspection - thanks.
