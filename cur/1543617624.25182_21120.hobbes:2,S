yes, I was thinking about you report.

Then can you verify the bandwith you get out of the network card is the
same across 2.4.13-ac7 and all the other kernels you are trying. Also
please check with an hdparm -t the speed you get out of IDE is the same.
This sounds like some driver changed (note that -ac is used to queue
lots of driver updates) and that made the difference. Otherwise if we
wakeup bdflush early enough I don't see why it takes more time.
