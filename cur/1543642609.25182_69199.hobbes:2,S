In a large tower case, it is worth while to leave a drive bay free between disks, instead of using them sequentially, like this:
    ------             ------
    |****|             |****|
    ------             ------
    |    |             |****|
    ------             ------
    |****|             |****|
    ------  instead of ------
    |    |             |    |
    ------             ------
    |****|             |    |
    ------             ------
    |    |             |    |
    ------             ------
Also, if you get a disk that suddenly doesn't spin up, don't assume that the motor has died - you can sometimes bring them back to life by connecting power to them, and giving them a very sharp angular jolt in the plane of the platters - the effect is called static friction, (A.K.A. stiction)
