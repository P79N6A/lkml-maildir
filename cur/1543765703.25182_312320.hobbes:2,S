Fixing the -W warning was not the main point. The main point was simply 
that the check makes no sense at all.

Thank you for your feedback, that makes a lot of sense. That should get 
rid of the pointless tests, get rid of the -W warning and get rid of the 
off-by-one errors - sounds good to me.
I'll create patches and send them along shortly.

I'll watch out for those.  
I can either leave them alone or re-write as one of
    if (valid_signal(sig) && sig != 0)
    if (valid_signal(sig) && sig > 0)
any preference?
Personally I would probably go with the 
'rewrite as  if (valid_signal(sig) && sig > 0)' one to encourage use of 
the new valid_signal() function and make usage consistent.
