Respecting the wishes of the author of that code.  Are you suggesting
they should not be respected?
Anyone who's not happy about it can still take that portion out,
unless you accept changes that make this nearly impossible, which I
suppose you wouldn't given how strongly you feel about this.
Without this provision, you wouldn't be able to use the code in the
first place, so I don't perceive any loss for anyone.  Do you?

Exactly ;-)
Two-way cooperation.  I'm told that's good.  I was told this was even
desirable.
I can see that one-way cooperation could be perceived as unfair, even
if permissions granted by GPLv3 are all granted by GPLv2 as well.

But see, nobody would be adding restrictions to *your* code.  You'd
only be enabling mutual cooperation with projects whose authors
weren't happy about restrictions some licensees could impose on others
(including the authors themselves).

It is either way.  Do you deny that tivoization also benefits one
user/licensee?  And in detriment of others, while at that?

Your opinion is duly noted.  Thanks.

This is not about dual licensing at all, and this is not about others
code.  This is a decision you would have to make in order to enable
cooperation between projects.
If you don't want to make this decision, that's fine.  Nobody can be
forced to cooperate.  This works in both directions.
Don't try to frame those who want to respect and defend users'
freedoms as uncooperative.  This is *your* decision, and your decision
alone.
