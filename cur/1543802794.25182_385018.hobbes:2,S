You might also want to take a good look at how things like ACPI do
exports in sysfs: in /sys/firmware.  Not that ACPI is a good example of
_anything_ :), but that is probably more compliant with the current
model than your own /sys/xen.
Do you have a definitive list of things that you want to export?  Are
they things that come and go, or are they static?  Do you want hotplug
events for them?  Some of those things may be better fit platform
devices.  Notice that ACPI has entries in /sys/firmware/acpi
and /sys/devices/system/acpi.
