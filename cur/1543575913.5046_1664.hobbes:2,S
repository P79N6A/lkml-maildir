The changes in semaphore semantics are necessary to fix the spurious out of
memory with MAP_SHARED mappings and they came together with the removal of the
always-asynchronous kpiod. While it's certainly possible to remove it I don't
think removing the fix for MAP_SHARED stuff is a good idea.
Basically it's always safe to replace:
	down(&inode->i_sem);
	/* critical section */
	up(&inode->isem);
with the new fs-semaphore:
	fs_down(&inode->i_sem);
	/* critical section */
	fs_up(&inode->i_sem);
While it's always safe to use fs_down() in place of down(), it should be done
only with inodes that can be memory mapped using MAP_SHARED if in the
/* critical section */ there is any kind of not-GFP_ATOMIC or not-GFP_BUFFER
allocation like any kind of user-copy (as in every f_ops->write callback).
Most of those down are handled in the VFS and 99% of the time no changes are
necessary in the lowlevel fs so it should not even generate headaches to third
party fs maintainers (I think infact reiserfs patch didn't need any change).
Note: directory i_sem doesn't need the fs_down since a directory can't be
mapped in memory.
2.4.x doesn't need this per-process fs_locks information to avoid recursing on
the i_sem while flushing MAP_SHARED mappings to disk because the lowlevel fs
is required to implement a_ops->writepage to support MAP_SHARED, and the
page-flush gets synchronized only via the per-page lock (while in 2.2.x we need
the i_sem on the inode to call the non-zero-copy f_ops->write to flush the
MAP_SHARED dirty pages).
