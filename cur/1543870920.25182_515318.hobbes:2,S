Subject: [PATCH] Add some extra info regarding the kernel localversion.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/4/111

  Some formatting fixes, add a few lines describing the origin of the
git-based localversion string, and remove the last couple of lines
that erroneously claim that "git" isn't required for this, and that
Perl is.
