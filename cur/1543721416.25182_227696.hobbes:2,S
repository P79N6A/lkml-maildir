YAKT, sigh..  I don't quite understand what you mean with a "holdoff" so
maybe you could explain what problem you see?  You don't like cache_reap
beeing called from timer context?
As for realtime stuff you're probably better off using something like rtlinux,
getting into the hrt or even real strong soft rt busuniness means messing up
the kernel horrible.  Given you're @sgi.com address you probably know what
a freaking mess and maintaince nightmare IRIX has become because of that.
