Great, but fsck improvement wasn't on my mind. This is
a desirable feature for the NFS server, and for regular users.
Think about a backup program trying to maintain hard links.

Bummer. As I understand it, ZFS provides this. :-)

It can't be a userland problem if you allow disk blocks to move.
Volume resizing, logging/journalling, etc. -- they combine to make
the userland solution essentially impossible. (one could wipe the
whole partition, or maybe fill ALL space on the volume)
I think it needs to be per-extent.
At each level in the btree, you place a randomly generated key
for the more leafward nodes. This means that secure deletion is
merely the act of wiping the key... which can itself occur by
wiping the key of the more rootward node.

I believe so. Example: I have a linux-2.6 directory. It's not
a mount point or anything special like that. I want to copy
it to a new directory called wip, without actually copying
all the blocks. To all the normal POSIX API stuff, this copy
should look like the result of "cp -a", not hard links.

That's understandable, but note that Reiserfs can support this.
