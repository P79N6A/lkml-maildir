I'm not sure which way you're going here, those have their own config
entries, does that mean that you are advocating just making the Athlon
fixup a config option the user must set, or that all of these should be
on by default and appear in the delete-features menu, and/or be
controlled by my proposed option to build only for the target CPU. Or
was this just an informational comment?
I'm not looking to disagree with any of those suggestions, if you were
making one.
