I don't think tasks can not be permitted to move between containers.  As
a simple exercise, imagine that you have two processes with the same
pid, one in container A and one in container B.  You wish to have them
both run in container A.  They can't both have the same pid.  What do
you do?
I've been talking a lot lately about how important filesystem isolation
between containers is to implement containers properly.  Isolating the
filesystem namespaces makes it much easier to do things like fs-based
shared memory during a checkpoint/resume.  If we want to allow tasks to
move around, we'll have to throw out this entire concept.  That means
that a _lot_ of things get a notch closer to the too-costly-to-implement
category.
