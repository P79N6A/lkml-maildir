Hi there,
is anyone using an ZIP+ device over the imm SCSI hostadapter and
having Problems with 2.4.x?
I recently noticed, it doesn't work as expected (failed with
status b8).
If this is a problem not only I have, I'll dig deeper into this,
but I just would like to ask first to find similarities.
Regards
Ingo Oeser
