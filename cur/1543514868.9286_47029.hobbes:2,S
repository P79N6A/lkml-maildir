It would if it was some kind of klunky mapping. On a sane machine it isnt.
On x86 for example:
	#define __io_virt(x) ((void *)(x))
	#define memcpy_fromio(a,b,c)    memcpy((a),__io_virt(b),(c))
so you get no overhead.
What happens on a sparc64 is another guess.

You are welcome and encouraged to submit documentation fixes. Bad documentation
is a bug.
