2.2.15pre14 (compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3) crashed hard today. It had been up
4 days and 16 hours. The distribution is debian potato (up to date). 
Hardware is Intel PII 333Mhz with 192MB of RAM and 2x9GB U2W-LVD IBM-disks
on a Tekram U2W-adapter (sym53c895) and 2x6,5GB IDE Disks and a IDE-CDROM.
System has 3Com 3c59x ethernet-card.
Crash occurred a moment after mounting a CD with a Joliet filesystem and
starting to read a html-file from the cd using Lynx.
Nothing on the logs about the reason for the crash.
I saw something like 'cannot kill idle task' and 'kernel panic' on the
screen before it froze completely. had to cycle the power.
This system was very stable (hundreds of days of uptime with
2.2.10) before the 2.2.15pre14 kernel (at the same time when the kernel
was upgraded, we added those SCSI-devices).
This system is running Apache, Squid, Qmail, Leafnode and things like
that.. not very loaded, but in use all the time.
Any ideas?
