I tend to agree. I think the confusing part is the range of the IRQs on
that machine. Assuming that irq_vector[NR_IRQ_VECTORS = 1024] requires
more entries, then the IRQs should take that range, because
IO_APCI_VECTOR(irq) is just irq_vector[irq], for example. If NR_IRQS is
still 224, how can do_IRQ() can get the correct IRQ (i.e. >= 224) ? So
in that case, the IRQ should be smaller than 224, then irq_vector[]
should be smaller.
