I have a patch that is a more comprehensive version of this idea, but
it is not fully debugged, and has suffered some bitrot in the past
couple months.  This turns out to be a good performance improvement in
the general case too, but is more complex than your idea because there
are real locking changes needed to avoid deadlocks.  I can send you a
copy of the patch if you are interested.

like i said above, you have to be careful when touching inode_lock,
dcache_lock, and the mapping's tree_lock, because of potential
deadlocks.  the mapping's lock can be taken from softirq context, but
the inode and dcache locks cannot.
