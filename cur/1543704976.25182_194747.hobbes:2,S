I think I can do better than that by buying two-generation-behind cards
off EBay.  
The older Matrox, ATI, etc. cards have complete driver documentation
(AFAIK) or at least are very well supported by completely open Linux /
XFree86 drivers.  
You can get a Matrox Millenium G400 on EBay right now for under $20.  Or
an ATI 7500 for under $30.
So, as cool as an open-source graphics chip would be, I think if you
can't manufacture a complete AGP card with your new chip for less than
$30, and better performance than those parts...  don't bother.
