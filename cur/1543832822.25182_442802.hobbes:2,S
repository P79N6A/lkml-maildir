The problem is you trade ease of development for performance, penalizing
the users to save developer time.  Your proposals would require every
app to go through a software buffering layer.
Of course, you're free to develop a system like this.

Backwards compatibility, bugs still being worked out, waiting for
upstream to catch up, etc.  Same reason that distros never have the very
latest version of every app.

OK, but my point is that it does not make sense to put every imaginable
audio feature in ALSA.
