I disagree, MAP_FIXED means "I know what I am doing don't override
this unless the mapping area is not available in my address space."
You should never specify MAP_FIXED unless you _REALLY_ know what you
are doing.

Don't specify MAP_FIXED for MAP_SHARED mapping if you want
proper coherency, that's my answer for this one.

There is no efficient way to do this from userspace, only the
kernel has access to the more efficient cache flushing instructions.
You'd need to flush via loads to displace the aliasing cache lines.

No, the user is allowed to hang himself with MAP_FIXED.
The bug is in your code :)
