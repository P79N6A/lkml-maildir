I'm hoping to pick up the PAT cause at some point soon this stuff is
definitely required to get any use out of modern graphics hardware.
It is slightly orthogonal to the issue I mentioned in that I still
have the problem of allocating uncached memory without the flushing
overheads associated with making pages cached/uncached constantly..
