The documented vfork semantics are pretty much an artefact of the internals
of how C generated object code works; actually the semantics of vfork(2) are
fairly sane, basically like fork(2) + CLONE_VM + stopping the parent.

vfork(2) is just cloning the address space which is less expensive than
COW thing done by fork(2).
