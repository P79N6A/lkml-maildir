This kernel is a bit weird, ide is build into the kernel so it gets
first shot at anything it can manage.    I am not sure why the choices
were made to set it up the way it is setup, probably something historical.
I adjusted it so that IDE is a module and setup IDE to load after
sata_nv, so sata_nv is picking up the NVIDIA stuff, and it appears to
be alot better behaved.
