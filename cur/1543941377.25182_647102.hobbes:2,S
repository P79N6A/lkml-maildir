Tejun,
If you could explain your objection to James's patches in this area, I 
would really appreciate it.
We have several conflicting patches in this area, and we need to get the 
details sorted.
I think you mentioned a key objection that was we actually need to know 
/two/ sizes at the block layer:  (1) the size including all padding and 
drain buffers, and (2) the raw or "true" size.
