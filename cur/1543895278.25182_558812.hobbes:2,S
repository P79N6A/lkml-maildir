you argue that it is evil for tivo to produce a pice of hardware that they 
can modify and the user can't
but you then argue that it's a good thing for the FSF to produce a license 
that they can modify and others can't
in the first case tivo is limiting their hardware, releases all the 
source for the software under the license, and makes it very clear that 
this is the case before anyone buys a box.
in the second case the FSF is trying to convince everyone that anyone who 
produced code under the fist license, but didn't give the FSF the ability 
to relicense their code to whatever the FSF wants are misguided fools who 
just don't understand what they are doing.
I for one see what tivo is doing as being much less evil then what the FSF 
is doing.
