I have the same board runing with 2x400 @504 (84Mhz bus)with no
problems.
I can overclock without errors to 94. What is your voltage setting. I
have found anything above 2.1 causes it to run too hot. I have mine set
at 2.05v. Later today I am going to put the new 100Mhz Celerons in to
see if this problem is related to overclocking.
These are the only negative messages I get:
mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent fixed MTRR settings
mtrr: probably your BIOS does not setup all CPUs
=======
2.0v, I havn't bothered playing with voltage at all, same mtrr messages on boot.
The machine isn't normally running overclocked. I wound it up simply to see if
that affected the error interrupts. "" with the heatsink and fan.
I doubt it's temperature alone, I can't check the temperature on the BX chip,
it's totally inaccessable, but the heatsink temperature has gone down from
painfully hot to warm. Since I used to work with real power electronics I'm
confident the heatsink paste has been applied properly and has made a
difference to the chip temperature.
It could be simply that the Celeron isn't spec'd to do SMP and the timing is
dodgy on some chips, or we could have something messed up in the APIC
programming.
As others have commented, it doesn't appear to affect stability, but the spam
is annoying.
My post was simply to point out that ignoring these reports "because it's caused
by overclocking" may well mean we are ignoring a real problem.
