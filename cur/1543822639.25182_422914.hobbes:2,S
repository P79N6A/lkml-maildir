Subject: [PATCH] neighbour.c, pneigh_get_next() skips published entry
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/11/130

The following patch fixes a problem where output from /proc/net/arp
skips a record when the full output does not fit into the users read()
buffer.
To reproduce: publish a large number of ARP entries (more than 10
required on my system). Run 'dd if=/proc/net/arp of=arp-1024.out
bs=1024'. View the output, one entry will be missing.
Please review and commit if acceptable.
