Presumably via a driver that plugs itself in there, then resets the
timer to spin faster and only passes through every 100th (or whatever)
tick to the routine behind it...

Nope, but you might wish to have a look at the various patches that
raise Linux's HZ rate as those also allow suchlike increases to take
place in a compatible manner...

No problem...
Best wishes from Riley.
