I would rather not see the filtering applied to printk specifically like 
you've done it. I think this is still another stop gap measure for buffer 
overruns. I would like to see for:
1) Buffer overruns - a mechanism that wouldn't hit a buffer overrun, say a 
relayfs implementation of printk that could be easily configured in, or a 
mechanism that knows/reports when a overrun has happened like the Linux event 
logging project.
For relayfs, please see: 
http://www.opersys.com/relayfs/index.html
For event logging, please see: 
http://evlog.sourceforge.net/
2) Message filtering - a mechanism above printk that allows filtering on the 
fly and built into the new device model. Such a mechanism as Patrick 
described that could be put into the dev_* macros in device.h. 
Thanks,
Dan
