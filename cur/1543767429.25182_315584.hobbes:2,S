sure. i recompiled the kernel with magic keys and debugger activated [1], 
and kswapd0 does idle normally, now. it seems to solve my issue, but i 
don't know why. 
for redundancy, here the Regs (alt-sysrq-p):

the unknown_bootoption confuses me a little. the only bootoption i use is 
"devfs=nomount" because i use udev and because people in archlinux may 
use instead of udev the devfs i keep devfs in the kernel.
hope it helps you. as i said, now, with minimal debug options and magic 
keys configured into the kernel, the kswapd0 idles normally. (so a 
workaround to my issue is activating ) 
greetings,
Damir
