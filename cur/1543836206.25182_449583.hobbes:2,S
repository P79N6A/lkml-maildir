Its old lock_kernel() code so its a prime suspect for most offences.
Given the age of the reports it appears that the tty buffering changes
are too new. The ldisc locking changes are a candidate but shouldn't be
doing anything that breaks the kernel lock stuff. Will look tomorrow see
if anything strikes me about that lot.
The tty_mutex primarily protected current->signal.tty (except if you are
using SELinux which has some extremely dubious looking code for tty
handling). Someone ought to review flush_unauthorized_files() although
it doesn't fit this problem.
