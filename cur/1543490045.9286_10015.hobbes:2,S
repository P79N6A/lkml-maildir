"minimal" is also called "single process". The system is required to 
provide threads, timers, and rt signals, plus semaphores. 
"multi" is what people think of: sched_setsched, mlock, +basic nonrt
posix. It seems like LynxOS and VxWorks people insistet on a minimal
standard so that they could claim POSIX conformance without adding all
that junk.
