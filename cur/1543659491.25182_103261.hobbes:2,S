I got reports from two people who said that they got it working.
One of them (I haven't updated my page yet) said that the Evo N410c
was "using a variant of the AD1886 (the AD1886A)" and that 2.4.19's
ac97_codec.c could be modified to add to ac97_codec_ids:
  { 0x41445363 ,"Analog Devices AD1886A", &null_opts },
and then it works with:
  modprobe i810_audio clocking=41194
Nicolas tried this, as he reported, with 2.4.20 and said that it was
still crashing. I haven't played with this myself yet.
Regards,
Hugo
