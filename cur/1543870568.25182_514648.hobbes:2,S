Yes. So, you used very different interface interface from ulimit,
which means locking is hard.
Plus, what you are doing can be done in userspace using google
coredumper.

Now this is an ugly interface. "If user tries to write to /proc file
while it is locked, return him spurious error.

Yep, very nice, if you used interface suited for the task (ulimit),
you'd not have to invent new locking like this.
Anyway, I don't care, and you don't listen. You got the design wrong,
and your code can be done in userspace, anyway. This is "NAK" from me,
but unfortunately I'm not in power to decide this. So at least drop me
from Cc in future submissions.
