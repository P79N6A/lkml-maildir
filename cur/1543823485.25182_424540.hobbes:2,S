Subject: [PATCH 04/10] SPI: spi bounce buffer has a minimum length
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/16/329

From: David Brownell <david-b@pacbell.net>
Make sure that spi_write_then_read() can always handle at least 32 bytes
of transfer (total, both directions), minimizing one portability issue.
