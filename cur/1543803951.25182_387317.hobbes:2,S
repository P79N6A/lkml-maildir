aww, man, this is awful.  Code is supposed to know what context it's
running in, not go fishing about in core internals trying to fix up its own
confusion.

Yes, it is.  in_atomic() is a no-op on !PREEMPT and local irq's can be
enabled in soft- or hard- interrupt context, so irqs_disabled() will return
0.
