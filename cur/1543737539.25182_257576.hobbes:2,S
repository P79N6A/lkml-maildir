I don't think this is right. For ppc, eieio is
already included as part of the assembly for the
IO operations. If you could delete that, great,
but I suspect that nearly all drivers would break.
There's an existing eieio() inline function that
you could use, instead of fresh assembly code.
BTW, the "eieio" name is better. The "wb" part
of "mmiowb" looks like "write back" to me, as if
it were some sort of cache push operation. It is
also lacking an appropriate song. :-)
