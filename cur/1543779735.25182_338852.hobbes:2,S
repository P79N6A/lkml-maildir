Hello All,
Sorry to interrupt you.
There seem to be some architecture specific problems using ptrace in
the vDSO segment on IA32, ptrace and read fails from this segment with
BAD ADDRESS.
I was just wondering if there could be any why we can tell kernel not
to map this vDSO for optimization of system call overhead.
Your kind help and effort regarding this issue is greatly appreciated.
Thanks a lot.
Regards,
Vamsi kundeti
