I haven't found any actual problem *use*, I just looked at the size of
'struct smp_resp' and noticed that coverity seemed to be right that 56
bytes are not sufficient to hold the members of the struct.  There are
32 bytes in the first members + the union and I don't see how that can
ever stay at 56 bytes...?  So, we are allocating memory and storing it
in a 'struct smp_resp *', but we are allocating less than
sizeof(smp_resp) - how is that not a (potential) problem?
