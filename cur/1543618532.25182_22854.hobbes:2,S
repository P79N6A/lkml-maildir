Ordinary pal encoded mpeg2 files plays with 25 frames per sec.
As I wrote, vlc plays smooth and fine _without_ amd_disconnect with the
documented load. With disconnect, vlc suffers from sound drop outs but I 
haven't digged further in this vlc issue, as it was clearly related to the 
cpu disconnect feature. Also, there were noticable delays in actions
like starting a Xterm via shortcut of approx. 0.5 sec, which I don't
see without disconnect.
Because of the mutual exclusive nature of this feature, I filed it
under unfinished hardware feature.
On behalf of power saving, I will look into swsusp/ACPI suspend again soon.
Cheers,
