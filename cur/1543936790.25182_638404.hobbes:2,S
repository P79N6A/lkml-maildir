I glanced at the page. I don't know Korean, but it seems OK.
What do you mean by saying this? I can't catch your points.

I think you've overstated.
Translation does _not_ mean avoiding learning English. I agree with
what you said above about English. But just as you said, it needs
_time_ and translation *is* a good way to help this. I, myself,
began to learn computer English by reading the translations of some
famous English textbooks, and then reading the original ones.

Translations can be put in .po files.
Thanks.
