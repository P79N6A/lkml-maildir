The patch is against 2.6.10-rc2-your-latest-patch
It adds the VM size of the child processes and tries to kill a child of
the selected process first. It could be discussed, if we just kill the
parent, but it turned out that the kill child first approach has less
unexpected results.

I think the current solution is just fine. I tested it thoroughly with
different scenarios and was not able to break it. The ugly time, count
hacks are gone and I have the impression that it tries harder to swap
out stuff now. I also tested with swap off and it works without hassle.
There may be some remaining "surprise" hidden in the selection, but I'm
not sure if it is worth the time to optimize it further or even rewrite
it with some other builtin surprises.
