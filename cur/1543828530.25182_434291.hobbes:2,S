I don't know for sure.  I have looked at it a bit and
it's messy code IMHO.  Might be easier/better just to rewrite
the function (comment) header parsing.
Andrew also wants the short function description to be able to be
more than one line.  That could/should be incorporated at the same time.
OTOH, it's a defined doc. language and these files contain errors...
