Ok, that is what it does.  That is not what *I* would have *expected* it to do.  I
would have expected it to remain a struct when viewed from the outside rather than
become an "N-byte blob".

First of all, it is what the compiler does and has done since the
__packed__ attribute was added.
Second of all, you are asking it to "PACK" the structure, this includes
any place you place it within other data objects.  It becomes an N-byte
blob that has no alignment constraints must be placed exactly where it
is declared.
I am growing very tired of this thread.
