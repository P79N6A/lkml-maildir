I ran into this same bug on my Dual 1GHz Windtunnel G4 with an  
upgraded GPU (Radeon 9800) in the 2.6.16-rc4 timeframe.  Turning off  
the customized console font selection and reverting to the default  
list of fonts fixed the problem for me.  I think I had the console  
rotation config option turned on, but I don't have that config any  
more and can't be sure.
