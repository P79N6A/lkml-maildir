With this issue you're seeing is only the printk timestamps jumping
back, correct?
For example, you're not seeing the output from gettimeofday() or the
actual jiffies value (as seen from maybe a driver) jump backward? Is
that right?
The printk timestamps may jump around a bit at bootup,  especially if
you have unsynced TSCs, so that is a known issue. However its not
known to have any actual negative effect other then maybe causing the
dmesg log to be a bit confusing.
