Hi,
i just wanted to let you know that this one doesn't lock up for me. I
actually built for 486 [to be able to run the image in qemu first]. After
the run in qemu showed no problems, i went to boot the kernel on my real
machine. It seems to work fine so far with rtc_wakeup showing max. jitters
around 30 usec (at f=1024) under load (find's + kernel compile)..
Will build a kernel (0.7.21) with debugging enabled to see if i miss any
BUG's.
