Hey, your choice, should you decide to accept it, is to just get rid of 
them entirely.
You claim that we're back to square one, but that's simply the way things 
are. Either "inline" means something, or it doesn't. You argue for it 
meaning nothing. I argue for it meaning something.
If you want to argue for it meaning nothing, then REMOVE it, instead of 
breaking it.
It really is that simple. Remove the inlines you think are wrong. Instead 
of trying to change the meaning of them.
