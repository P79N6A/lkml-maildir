Problem is that A4Tech driver does not care. It just interprets incoming
data in the way I described: +-1 is vertical move, +-2 is horizontal,
0 is no move, and everything else is ignored... This is A4Tech's 
interpretation of ImPS/2 and ExPS/2 protocols.
So we can either assume (like GPM does) that wheel movement can be
only +-1, and so we can safely assume that +-2 is horizontal move,
and then everything is fine, or we need some option which will affect
mouse driver behavior.
All my (A4Tech...) PS/2 wheel mouse report wheel movement only +-1 even
with 10Hz sample rate, but I do not think that my mouses are representative
sample of available ExPS/2 implementations.
