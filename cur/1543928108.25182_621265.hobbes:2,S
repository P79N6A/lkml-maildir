David:  The exact command this time was a "tar jxf linux-2.6.23.tar.bz2" as 
part of an emerge (gentoo).  Gnu tar version 1.18 but has happened with 
prior versions too.  I replicated it after my post by manually untarring it 
on the command line and can almost always replicate the problem with any 
large (GCC/kernel) tarball.  If I shut down all other processes, the untar 
will go longer but eventually the oom-killer will be invoked.
Pavel:  I'll ping Olver Neukum about it.
Thanks for the responses!
