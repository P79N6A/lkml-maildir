Subject: 2.6.{9,10}: C3 not working once USB driver gets loaded (ThinkPad T40p)

Hi,
In recent kernels (tried 2.6.9, 2.6.10), after I load the uhci_hcd module,
the processor never goes to state C3.  Unloading the module again puts things
back to normal.  The system is an IBM ThinkPad T40p.
Is the USB driver setting some kinda flag in the ACPI subsystem to achieve
this behavior intentionally or is this a bug?
Thanks,
