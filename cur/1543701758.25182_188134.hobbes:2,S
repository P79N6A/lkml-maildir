Nice.  I have a 386 I really should try this out on.
Of note IPv4 is about 90K compressed.  And I know you can do a minimal
IPv4 stack in about 8K compressed.
My target is a minimal kernel that can be used as a bootloader.  But
what I am looking for at first is to be able to turn as many things
off as possible so that we can test to see how much individual pieces
add.
If you look at ELKS or one of the old unix like kernels you can get
those down to 64K and still be usable.
I'm currently looking at removing the buffer cache, since I most
of the time I don't care about disks.  This is complicated by the fact
that many of the default paths in the kernel when they don't have a
better implementation use buffer cache methods.  But I'm making
headway.
Proc is one of things that frequently has loads of crap that are
not needed in a minimal setup.
Until I find more candidates to turn off I can't see any low hanging
fruit for shrinking in size.
