It turns out I misread SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT check in ptrace_stop(),
didn't notice '(->parent->signal != current->signal) ||' before
it.
You are right, this is a problem, I need to think about it.
Do you see any solution which doesn't need tasklist_lock to be
held while traversing global process list?

Yes, changelog refers to SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT check in get_signal_to_deliver.
However, do_signal_stop() returns 0 when it doesn't see SIGNAL_STOP_DEQUEUED,
(which was cleared by SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT), so I think we don't depend on
SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT check in get_signal_to_deliver. No?
Btw, I don't understand Andrea's patch (and changelog) too.
Oleg.
