: Nod. I met someone at Usenix who thought LM wasnt original either and had

I believe that would be the DEC Ultrix splice() paper.  I looked at that,
and while it was cool, it had the same problem of only looking at a tiny
part of the problem.  It was quite special cased, and worked well for their
intent, but isn't terribly interesting today.  However, if I failed to
provide a pointer in the splice doc, shame on me, and ping me for that 
reference, I'll go track it down.
