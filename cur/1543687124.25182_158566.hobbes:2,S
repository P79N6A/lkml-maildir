I know...

It seems that only you have understand my question! :-)

VERY [OT]:
Why do I do all these questions?
At present I'm working on a very small kernel (PabloX :):
- it's very simple: it only uses segmentation and has drivers only for stupid 
things like AT-PS/2 keyboard (do you have USB keyboard? I'm sorry!)
- some (a lot of) code is taken from linux 0.01 / 1.0 / ... 
If anyone want to see this stupid thing:
http://members.xoom.virgilio.it/javaman/
NOTE: don't read the comments in source code! They are a mix of pseudo-English 
and Italian!
To try it:
tar xzf pablox.tar.gx
cd pablox/
make
now you should have a floppy image in ./IMAGE, I suggest insert a floppy and 
do "make disk", than reboot and see keyboard leds! (if you have an AT or PS/2 
keyboard)
press (1,2,3,4) to switch to console (1,2,3,4): the consoles are stupid! All 
the programs write to the current console...
press "ESC" to reboot!
Bye,
	Paolo
