Not from a tasklet. ;)
I had a custom primitive some time ago which I imaginatively named 
taskletex. When scheduling a tasklet one could then specifiy a delay in 
jiffies. If zero, a normal tasklet would be scheduled and if >0 a timer 
would be added. Nothing fancy or special really, but it was useful for the 
work I was doing at that time.
