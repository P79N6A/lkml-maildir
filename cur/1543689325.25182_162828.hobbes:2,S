I don't see why this is a problem.  The change is compatible with the
existing uses.  We need to be able to map 36-bit physical addresses on
44x.  What we really need now is 64-bit start/end values in struct
resource.

First, it's a PPC-only change, and secondly, it's been around for
months in the linuxppc-2.5 tree - since June last year in fact, and
even longer than that in the linuxppc_2_4_devel tree.  Lkml is not
where most PPC-specific stuff gets discussed, it's too noisy for that.
