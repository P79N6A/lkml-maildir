Hi!
we are going to por th e TCP/IP stack as a project (about 7 of us).
Before we started , I was wondering if anyone could give me some pointers
on some of the following issues :
1) Porintg strategy such as which module to start with 
2) Testing at each stage of the porting.
3) Performance considerations.
Could anyone please point me to any web resources on this topic.
Please cc any answers to me.
I am not subscribed to either list and any
help will be greatly
appreciated.
Thanks for any replies.
