Could you please shortly explain what this option does...(before it
fills my logfiles with notes "succesfully wrote 1 Byte to disk abc"..:-)
i had recently also some problems with aic7xxx, but they where due to a
misconfigured scsi-bus and perhaps a bad drive (is still under test), so
i enabled scsi error logging in the kernel (2.4.3, RH7.1) and by sending
the following strings to /proc/scsi/scsi:
/bin/echo "scsi log error 5" > /proc/scsi/scsi
/bin/echo "scsi log mlqueue 3" > /proc/scsi/scsi
/bin/echo "scsi log hlcomplete 1" > /proc/scsi/scsi
/bin/echo "scsi log scan 5" > /proc/scsi/scsi
But it did not give me that kind of info i wanted to see...does the
"aic7xxx=verbose" something similar or something completly different ?

Thats true, and e.g., my relatively new IBM-drives (DGHS18V, 2x
DNES-309170W,  DDRS-39130W, all Server-disks according to IBM) can only
64...and the kernel complains, if i compile it with 255 and locks to
64...as i have played with this feature a while ago, i did not realize a
big performance-plus from 8 to 64, so i switched to 32...and i would go
down to <8 if i where in doubt....

Test it longer and under load...i also "cured" a bad scsi-bus by
switching drivers one time...sometimes it really seems to work...for
some days...:-)

Solong...

Microsoft isn't the answer.
Microsoft is the question, and the answer is NO.
