BTW, what is the intended use of the min event count parameter? The
obvious reason I can see, avoiding waking up a thread too often with
few queued events, would imo be handled cleaner by just passing a
parameter telling the kernel to try to queue more events.
With a min event count you'd have to use a rather low timeout to
ensure that events get handled within a resonable time.
