Hi Dean.

is no time to do anything else (since it will inevitably take 33
seconds to actually perform the compilation).
Personally, I see DRM as the best thing Microsoft could take under
their wings, as it's an almost sure-fire bet that any company that
whole-heartedly embraces it will soon go bust...
Best wishes from Riley.
