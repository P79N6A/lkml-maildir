The reason I'm looking at this is because I'm on a headless net-booting device. 
We properly save and restore the entropy pool on startup/shutdown, but without
using network interrupts we have no way to generate more entropy.  I was looking
at turning on SA_SAMPLE_RANDOM in our network driver, but then I realized that
it would have no effect because it isn't even supported on PPC.
So the upshot seems to be that there is no real reason why it isn't there, it
just hasn't been seen as required.  Am I right?
