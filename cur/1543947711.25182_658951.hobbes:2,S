Subtle.
Very subtly wrong ;-).
imagine suspending_task == 0xabcdef01. Now task "R" with current ==
0xabcd0000 reads suspending_task while the other cpu is writing to it,
and sees 0xabcd0000 (0xef01 was not yet written) -- and mistakenly
believes that  "R" == suspending_task.
I agree it is very unlikely, and it will not happen on i386. But what
about just using atomic_t suspending_task, and store current->pid into
it?
