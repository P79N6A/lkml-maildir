The staticly linked userspace binary loader seems like the best solution 
to me.  For binary distributions of Wine there's no need to compile 
kernels or modules at install time, no need to be root to install and no 
need for us to write and maintain kernel code for N different operating 
systems.  Please let me know if you think of a way to break this solution ;)
Anyway, thanks for at least trying to keep these kind of changes for new 
major versions.
Mike
