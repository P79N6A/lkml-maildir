This is probably going to converge on the PageReserved removal patch,
and the way get_user_pages now refuses on a VM_RESERVED vma.
I don't want to send you a patch for that immediately, we're still
thinking through the implications of allowing VM_RESERVED there again
(it might just hit another BUG, or leak memory).  And we probably
need to take the separate "vbetool" problem into account too.
Though if you're curious and impatient, you could try just editing
the " | VM_RESERVED" out of mm/memory.c get_user_pages.
