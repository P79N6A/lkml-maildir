As a possibly relevant aside, according to a recent message on lkml, 
that board (Asus A7M266-D) was discontinued.  See the message by 
coles@vip.kos.net dated Mon, 17 Jun 2002 20:58:50 -0400, subject "Dual 
Athlon issue temporarily resolved", as well as the initial post on Sat, 
15 Jun 2002 18:21:35 -0400 with subject "Dual Athlon 2000 XP MP nightmare".
Regards,
Brian
