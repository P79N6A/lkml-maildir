I'll have to confess here: I haven't managed to do much at all in over a
year :-( The last thing I was looking at in the current driver was the
directory handling, and after a while all the
NTFS_PUTU32(foo+0x<magic number>, ...) stuff really fried my brain. I did
start some new code a while back which actually used structs to
represent the on-disk structures ;-) and was supposed to play nicely with the
page cache. But I never got very far with it.
