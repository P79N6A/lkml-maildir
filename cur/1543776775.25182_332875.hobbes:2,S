You don't need to zero out swapfiles. You can fill them with anything,
even /dev/urandom.  Zero-filling may be faster though.  A swapfile
is not zero the second time you use it - then it contains leftovers
from last time.

Linux doesn't grow swapfiles at all.  It uses what's there at mkswap time.
You can make new ones of course - manually.

You can create 50M quickly - even if it actually have to be written.  If
you can't, don't use that device for swap. 
Ability to allocate some blocks without actually writing to them is nice 
for this
purpose, but current linux filesystems doesn't have an api for doing that.
The necessary changes would touch all existing writeable filesystems, and
that is a lot of work for very little gain.  As they say, you don't 
create swapfiles
all that often.  The time saved on swapfile creation might take a long 
time to
make up for the time spent on making, auditing and supporting those
changes.
