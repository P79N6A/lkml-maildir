But if  we are using capabilities on all the machines, hacking into
sendmail won't give you this sort of access (or am I misunderstanding what
we are after here?)

The reason to use the NFS server is not cost (A good, redundant NFS server
can be very expensive) the reason is ease of management, if you only have
one copy of the data the possibility that different servers have different
info just isn't there.

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
