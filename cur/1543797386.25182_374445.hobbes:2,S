Ok, good.  That leaves the c3tsc slowdown as the only outstanding issue at
this stage.

No problem.  Let me know when you have something to test or need further
info.

That I can't be sure of - I didn't know about the clock source selection at
the time I observed it.  As mentioned above, the tests I did this morning
with the hi res timer enabled did not exhibit the problem even though tests
about 2 weeks ago showed that enabling the hi res timer caused "sleep 1" to
sleep for 38 seconds (other "sleep" calls were similarly too long).  For now
I'm happy to wait until the c3tsc thing is fixed; once that's out of the way
I'll then retest everything to see if the sleep problem is reproducable.
