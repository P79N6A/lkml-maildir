Hello Robert,
I think I am not very much clear. Let me try to
clarify more.
My intention is not build or port kernel driver
without using KBUILD.
I know about driver porting and Writing makefile using
KBUILD.
I don't have any issue about that.
       
I just want understand the whole process for clearity
thats it.
unfortunately I didn't get any answer from linux-doc
and linux-admin about this issue.
Let me try to understand KBUILD internal architecture
more by self.
Any Way.
Thanks for your view.
Murtuja Bharmal
