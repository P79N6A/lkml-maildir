That 41MB or lets say 200MB is spread over several months between
releases.   Pulling once a day from the git public repository, makes this
barely noticeable.  In the future there may be optimized protocols to
handle this more efficiently.
You bring up a good point about backups though.  Eventually it might be
nice to have a utility that exports/imports a git repository in a flat
file using deltas rather than snapshots.   Such an export format would
make backups and tarballs cheaper.
