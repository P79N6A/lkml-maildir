Subject: Capabilities just for root privileges?

Are capabilities just going to exist to add/remove root-only capabilities?
Or are there plans to, for example, disallow all network connections from
a particular program?  It would be nice to have a program that I could
leave running that had absolutely no access to the filesystem also.  I can
see that being useful if I only needed to talk to the network and serve
data from a database.  Just a thought.
