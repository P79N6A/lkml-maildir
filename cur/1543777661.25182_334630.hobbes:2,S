Dominik, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.  The memory regions must be
free to be able to call into readable(), and therefore pccard_validate_cis().
What seems to be happening is that s->ops->set_mem_map in set_cis_map
is returning an error, causing it to free the ioremapped region
multiple times.  Maybe the card has an invalid CIS causing an out
of range card_start to be requested?
