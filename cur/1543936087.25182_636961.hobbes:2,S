(b) is half-true, actually.  The grouping by lifetime makes a lot of
sense.  LogFS has a similar problem to slabs (only full segments are
useful, a single object can pin the segment).  And when I grouped my
objects very roughly by their life expectency, the impact was *HUGE*!
In both cases, you want slabs/segments that are either close to 100%
full or close to 0% full.  It matters a lot when you have to move
objects around and I would bet it matters even more when you cannot move
objects and the slab just remains pinned.
So just because the type alone is a relatively bad heuristic for life
expectency does not make the concept false.  Bonwick was onto something.
He just failed in picking a good heuristic.  Quite likely spreading by
type was even a bonus when slab was developed, because even such a crude
heuristic is slightly better than completely randomized lifetimes.
I've been meaning to split the dentry cache into 2-3 seperate ones for a
while and kept spending my time elsewhere.  But I remain convinced that
this will make a measurable difference.
