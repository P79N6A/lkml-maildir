What will replace it?  If you intend to keep the two 
projects in sync and easy to update, I'm afraid that it will 
call for putting all the later (>=2.4.16) #if's back, as 
well as adding gaurds for the current 2.5-specific 
scheduling/worqueue changes.  Unless, of course, the dri 
maintainers are willing to make TRUNK incompatible with 
linux-2.4...
Cheers,
Nicholas
