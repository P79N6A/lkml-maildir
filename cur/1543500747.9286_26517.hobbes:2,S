This is ridiculous.

Each inode would need to store a list of directories in which it is linked.
Hard linking would no longer be efficient. Nothing would be efficient, in fact.
I seriously doubt that it is worth taking that hit for some abstract notion of
what a directory's size should be.
And even that abstract notion is questionable. Why should directories be thought
of as holding everything beneath them recursively? It makes equal if not better
sense that they hold exactly what you get when you readdir() them. In which case
the size should be one of
1) size allocated, as is current scheme
2) actual number of bytes used by directory entries
3) number of directory entries
4) total size of all the files corressponding to the directory entries
There are reasons that 1) is preferred, basically that a directory is stored
(at least in ext2) as a file with possible unused space in it. Another
filesystem with a different storage layout for directories is free to choose a
different interpretation.
