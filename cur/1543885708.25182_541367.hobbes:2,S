WARNING: arch/arm/mach-realview/built-in.o - Section mismatch:
 reference to .init.text: from .data between 'realview_timer' (at offset 0x54)
 and 'clcd_plat_data'
Weird, these two data structures don't interact with each other.  Probably
bogus.
WARNING: init/built-in.o - Section mismatch:
 reference to .init.text: from .text between 'rest_init' (at offset 0x2c)
 and 'run_init_process'
WARNING: mm/built-in.o - Section mismatch:
 reference to .init.text: from .text between 'kmem_cache_create' (at offset 0x1bd94)
 and 'cache_reap'
WARNING: mm/built-in.o - Section mismatch:
 reference to .init.text: from .text between 'kmem_cache_create' (at offset 0x1bdcc)
 and 'cache_reap'
Are these more bogus?
