Once everything in the kernel tree has been cleaned up to work with 4k stacks, 
then none of the in-kernel drivers need this option.  No future kernel 
drivers will be accepted into the tree if they don't work with 4k stacks, 
either.  Therefore, the 8k stack option becomes something _only_ needed for 
out-of-tree drivers, and if out-of-tree drivers need >4k stacks they can 
maintain the 8k patch out of tree along with said driver.
Why is this difficult to understand?  The "impact on the implementation" of 
having 100 extra exports of random internal kernel symbols is fairly small as 
well (from a lines of code perspective), but on a policy level it ain't gonna 
happen.
