I had the same problem with 2 WD disks on a desktop machine for 2 years, until 
I activated ACPI S3 (suspend to RAM) in the BIOS. According to this bug 
report (
https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=229210
) the problem may 
be due to bad interaction between libata and the shutdown command. Tejun Heo, 
whom I thank for his support, has already proposed a patch to fix this. From 
the description there, it looks like it may also fix the reboot problem this 
thread is about.
