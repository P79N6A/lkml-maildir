	No, the code being dual-licensed means you get to choose which license you
wish to comply with, not that you must comply with both. So long as you
comply with either license, you have the right to do whatever the license
you comply with gives you the right to do.
	Let's suppose, hypothetically, that you were right. Then let's further
suppose that GPL version 3 did not let you modify the source code at all.
Would you argue that all code with the "at your option" clause now can't be
modified? (Since modifying it would violate the GPLv3 license, and you seem
to think you can't violate either license.)
