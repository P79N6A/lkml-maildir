Subject: [RFC-patch] Doc/lockdep-design:  explain display of {state-bits}
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/15/222

Please offer corrections / wording improvements as appropriate.
In particular, the ".+-? " table could be more illuminating - I lack the
knowledge to make the right inferences..
(or just take it, and run with it ;-)

+When mutex rules are violated, these 4 state bits are presented in the
+mutex error messages, inside curlies.  A contrived example:
+
+   modprobe/2287 is trying to acquire lock:
+    (&sio_locks[i].lock){--..}, at: [<c02867fd>] mutex_lock+0x21/0x24
+
+   but task is already holding lock:
+    (&sio_locks[i].lock){--..}, at: [<c02867fd>] mutex_lock+0x21/0x24
+
+
+The bit position indicates hardirq, softirq, hardirq-read,
+softirq-read respectively, and the character displayed in each
+indicates:
+
+   '.'	 used
+   '+'  used in irqs
+   '-'  enabled in irqs
+   '?'  used and enabled (bits 3,4)
+
+Unused mutexes cannot be part of the cause of an error.

 Single-lock state rules:
