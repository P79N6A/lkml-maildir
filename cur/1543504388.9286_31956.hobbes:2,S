Note: I'm not campaigning for anything here except a responsible
image for linux. I'm just saying that telling people who want
to use multiple scheduling classes that the cost is 
extra instructions in the scheduler to engineer out priority
inversion is not controversial.
It's not even debatable for real time, they have to have it
without the possibility of priority deadlock. SCHED_IDLE
users might not want to run SCHED_IDLE processes at the cost
of slowing down their web server or mta or whatever the server
normally does, which was perhaps the point of the suggestion
to just mark it unsafe. But if the server is important enough
that any performance difference between everything running
SCHED_OTHER and the cost of priority inversion prevention
is an issue, then the server probably can't tolerate the possibility
of priority deadlock, either.
