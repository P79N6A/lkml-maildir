Actually, I take that back. I think gcc does the right thing, and yes, 
it's explained by the memory clobber being just a blind "write to memory" 
rather than read memory. My bad.
It does leave us with very few ways of saying that an asm can *read* 
memory, and so it might be good to have it clarified that "volatile" 
implies that (at least with the memory clobber).
Your examples are good, I think.
