Hi,
	I have installed Aurora 1.0 on a Sparc Ultra 60 workstation and have
a command line system running (X doesn't work yet but that's another
question for later).  
I have downloaded the 2.4.20 Kernel from www.kernel.org and started with the
default config file (defconfig) from the /usr/src/linux/arch/sparc64
directory.  The first time I built the Kernel all was OK.  However it didn't
load because the required scsi driver wasn't included.  So I ran make
xconfig to add it.  But then after a 
make dep
make vmlinux
I go an error from fonts.c in driver/video indicating that no fonts were
defined.
#ifdef NO_FONTS
#error No fonts configured.
#endif
This error wouldn't go away until I did a
make mrproper
make oldconfig
make dep
make vmlinux
I then made another change to the Kernel config and the same thing happened.
Can anyone throw some light on this?
Thanks
Kevin
