Dual ppro boxes normally run with a locked synchronous TSC clock. That
suggests the newer code broke stuff. It may also be due to the bug in
the 2.5 timer handling code (missing delays on timer reads, incorrect
assumption that the timer never reads its limit value during the timer 
switch back to zero)
