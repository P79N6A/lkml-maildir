I have also seen this problem, and it's hard to reproduce. What you will 
see is udev getting spawned
multiple times as reported by top. I have found its related to 
intermittent failures of the hard drive and
the hotpluger for some reason invoking udev multiple times in response 
to this. I saw it on a Compaq
laptop right before my hard drive croaked, and it seems BIOS specific as 
well, since I have never seen
it or been able to reproduce it reliably.
