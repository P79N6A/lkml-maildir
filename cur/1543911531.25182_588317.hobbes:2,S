Thomas Meyer,
The commit just adds the pinconfigs which Mac OS X and win32 use for
the Intel Macs (intel hda audio with the Sigmatel STAC9221 codec).
For me "Master" works fine with the speakers/headphones plugged in.
The volume of the internal speakers is bound to "Front" in the mixer
(can also be controled by "PCM"), but does not react to the "Master".
I've just thought this is by design - one can maintain two volume sets
for the internal speakers and the external speakers. I am probably
wrong.
In the meanwhile if you want to use your "fancy multimedia control
keys" as a workaround you could try to bind your multimedia keys to
execute:
volume up: amixer -q set PCM 10%+
volume down: amixer -q set PCM 10%-
I have attached codec info and amixer output for Tiwai.
Regards,
