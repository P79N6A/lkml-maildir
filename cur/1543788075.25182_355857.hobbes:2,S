/etc/mtab is just a regular file; no more, no less.  It's a place used by
mount(8) and several other programs.  Kernel has nothing to do with it...
Obns: that can get tough.  Note that Plan 9 one is an approximation that
works well enough for most uses; if you play with mounting/unmounting/renaming
in sufficiently perverted ways, you'll get unusable /proc/<pid>/ns.  The
trouble being, they are luckier - they don't have to deal with many classes
of perversion we do, so their soluition wouldn't work well for Linux.
