Well, now I have trashed my array :-)

Btw., it spits out *lots* of messages when IRQ sharing is *disabled*
in the kernel config and just dies quietly when it's *enabled*
(having it dying before didn't mess up my array... ;)).

?! I'm using the onboard IDE for two CDROM drives and one smaller
hard disk which I use rarely... and I didn't use any of these devices
in the cases in which I had the described problems... Anyway, why should I
connect a PS/2 mouse to the machine? Is it gonna solve all my
problems at once? ;-)
