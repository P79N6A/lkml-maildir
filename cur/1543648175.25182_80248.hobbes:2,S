When you oprofile KDE startup you notice that a lot of time is spent in
get_unmapped_area too. The reason is that every KDE process links with
10-20 libraries and ends up with a 40-50 entry /proc/<pid>/maps.
Optimizing this case would be likely useful too, although I suspect
Ingo's last hit cache would already help somewhat.
When you add a funky data structure please trigger it on the number
of mappings at least. e.g. I bet a micro optimized (= uses prefetch) 
single linked list or even array will be always best for <= 10 entries,
which is still not that uncommon in the non KDE world.
Array would be attractive because you can trivially prefetch it,
but would eat more space per mm_struct. Assuming each process has at 
least 5 mappings the cost should be rather small though.
