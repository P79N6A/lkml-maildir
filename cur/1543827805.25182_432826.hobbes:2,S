There are valid reasons for GPL code to not be merged into mainline.
I (and I'm sure there are others) work on GPL modules/patches that have 
no hope of making it into mainline because they're too specialized. 
Custom netfilter modules, drivers for special hardware, scheduler 
changes, additional instrumentation, etc.
Plus, we're usually working on a stabilized older version, so it's a lot 
of extra work to regenerate it against current versions to even try and 
merge it.
The source all goes to the customer but it just wouldn't make sense to 
have it in mainline.
So the "churn mainline to punish out-of-tree code" argument doesn't make 
sense to me.  If there's a good reason for the change, then go for 
it--but change just to make it hard for out of tree code is simply annoying.
