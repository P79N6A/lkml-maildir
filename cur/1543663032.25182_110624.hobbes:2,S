Note that this warning comes from asm/string.h, when compiling
fs/reiserfs/prints.c
Warning itself is "strchr is defined but not used". It have nothing
to do with reiserfs at all. And I do not see why it is produced at all, since
strchr is declared "static inline".
(BTW, gcc 2.95 does not produces the warning).
Can somebody look at it please?
Bye,
