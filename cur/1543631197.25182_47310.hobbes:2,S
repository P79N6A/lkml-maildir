Ok. Here is feedback on 2.5.17 uhci-hcd and usb-uhci-hcd.
I did not notice any difference in behavior. Both have the same 
performance, just like 2.4.19-pre8.
One-shot interrupt transfers are broken in *-hcd drivers. core/hcd.c 
returns EINVAL if urb->interval==0.
My Broadcom FW loader (uses usbdevfs) needs one-shot interrupts. So in 
order to test Broadcom devices
I changed to hcd.c to allow urb->interval==0. With that change uhci-hcd 
works just fine, I can load fw and
use the device. But usb-uhci-hcd kills the machine pretty hard (hw reset 
needed).
Here is a patch for hcd.c.

usb-uhci-hcd has to be fixed.
btw It tries to round interval value even thought it's done by hcd.c
So, Bluetooth USB devices should work fine with either usb-uhci-hcd or 
uhci-hcd.
(assuming that above patch is applied and one-shot is fixed in usb-uhci-hcd)
On a side note. Why are URBs still not SLABified ?
Drivers still have those silly urb pools and stuff. I thought you guys were 
gonna fix that.
