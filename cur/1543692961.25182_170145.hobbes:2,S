If you make /proc/.../fd return the same inode numbers for the
identical file descriptor tables, that would be just as good for fuser
performance.
fuser would stat() each of the /proc/<nn>/task/<yy>/fd entries and see
that they're the same as the group leader.
It is the same number of operations as checking for the non-existence
of /proc/<nn>/task/<yy>/fd entries, but more flexible.
Alternatively you could make the task fd directories be symbolic
links to the group leader fd directory.
