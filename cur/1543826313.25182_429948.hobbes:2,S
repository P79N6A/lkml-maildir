My immediate reaction to that was to tell posix to go take a hike.  I mean,
sheesh.

Well first we need to work out if there's any vague reason why we need to
mucky up our kernel by implementing this dopey spec.  If there is such a
reason then I guess I drop all the ustname patches and ask that they be
redone.  They're a bit straggly and a refactoring/rechanngelogging wouldn't
hurt.
