With some help from the very nice and efficent (!!) guys at Supermicro,
the problem has been resolved in bios for now by removing the cpu
temperature feature. This atleast solves the problem for us, since it
now no longer advertises a fake temperature.
The board P4SCE/P4SCA bios version 1.2c (or higher) will soon be
released
officially with this bugfix.
Hopefully they will include support for actual temperature readout at
some time.
Supermicro staff: Thank you =)
Sincerly
