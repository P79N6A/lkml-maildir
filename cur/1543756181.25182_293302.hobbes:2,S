Someone will fix them, but it's not the job of the 32bit emulation
of x86-64 to break compatibility. It's whole point is to be compatible,
not expose bugs.
If someone else wants to break existing programs they can 
do that if they think they have the capability to deal
with (rightfully) annoyed user space people. 
But not with x86-64 compat mode leading the front here.
