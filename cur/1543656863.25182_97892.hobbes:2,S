I wonder: for the sake of performance and good use of the precious clock-
cycles, shouldn't there be made a start of fixing those bugs? Assuming
that the bugs you're talking about are not compiler-bugs, they *are* bugs
in the code that should be fixed, shouldn't they?

So, let's make it -O6 per default for 2.7.x/3.1.x?
