The core purpose of tty_termios_baud_rate() is
'read only': returning a value from a table referenced
by an index in the termios structure.
It currently also performs a sanity check for
the index and adjusts the index if it is out of bounds.
I assume the lock is held to protect this
possible write access to the termios structure.
Would it not make sense to move the sanity check
to change_termios, which would then allow removal
of the locks from tty_termios_baud_rate()?
(which also removes the deadlock)
