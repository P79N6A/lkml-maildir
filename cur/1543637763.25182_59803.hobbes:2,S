eek.  Please let's not tie the delivery of the 2.6 kernel to
the success of this R&D effort.  We need reasonable-sized fixes, fast,
for the current problems so that people who have feature work banked

Plus, staying close to the 2.4 rmap VM allows us to leverage the
testing and experience which that has had, yes?
