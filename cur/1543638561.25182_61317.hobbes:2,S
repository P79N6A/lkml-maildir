We must read PCI config register 9 (programming interface), and check its value.
If r9 & 0x05 == 0x05, we can program BARs. 
Otherwise if r9 & 0x0A != 0x0A, we must not touch hardware: it supports 
only legacy 0x1F0/0x170 assignment (PCI-IDE spec says that BAR0-BAR3
can be either hardwired to zero, or it can be writeable, but written
value must be ignored).
If r9 & 0x0A == 0x0A, we must write r9 | 0x05 to PCI config register 9,
and then (after verifying that write suceeded... it does not suceed
in VMware, for example...) we must (re)program BARs.
Worst problem is that (some) VIA chips have BAR0-BAR3 writeable,
but are programmed to ignore them by BIOS (as IRQ14/IRQ15 routing is
not available when in native mode). Current kernel code will believe
that device was relocated, but reality will be different, because of device
ignores BAR0-BAR3 value until programming interface is modified.
