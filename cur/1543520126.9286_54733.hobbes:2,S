Ok, thanks for the hint, but I think that Xinetd/tcpwrappers offer a
different type of protecion than I wanted to. What I wanted to do is to
disable ALL incoming connection higher than 1024 (i.e. drop the packets
with SYN set/ACK cleared) and only allow passive ftp. Considering that
the patch adds rules directly through the kernel, I could lock the
ipchains rules themselves with a module from LIDS so they could not be
modified from anything but the boot scripts. This would be helpful in
prevention of backdoors, trojans etc. Quite possibly this may not work
however as I dont know how LIDS works exactly and have no knowledge of
the kernel source. 
This kind of filtering is present in modern stateful firewalls so I
didn't think that it was something special.
Anyway, I think I will change the ftp server then - to establish
connections only on a limited range of ports.
Thanks for the replies,
Vladimir
