It seems to me that you can create a single RAID-4 device out of
5 data and 1 parity disks, and run device mapper on top of that
RAID-4 device, picking every 6 chunk worth of data and
collecting into a device (totalling 6 devices).  The first 5
such device mapper devices would end up with blocks from the
underlying 5 data disks.  I do not know offhand if such a dm
target already exists, though.
