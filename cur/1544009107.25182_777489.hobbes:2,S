Although it's kind of broken to limit the number of GSI interrupts to
256, at least for HyperTransport systems where you can have MSIs that
look like IOAPICs (although discovered using a slightly different
mechanism.)
This also means, at least in theory, that IOAPICs could be discovered at
runtime!

Personally I think we should just fix the legacy PIC and southbridge
IOAPIC at zero, and let everything grow up from there.  We'll assign
IOAPIC numbers first just by virtue of them being discovered first, but
I don't really see a huge need to partition the space.
Assigning them numbers starting with 1000 does stand out, of course;
however, if we do that then we really need to make sure we don't run
into ugly surprises on HT systems.  On the other hand, perhaps none will
ever be built, since newer HT silicon is likely to use MSI-X rather than
MSI-HT just for compatiblity.
