I'd use it, if there were a really easy interface to the thing.
This would include both an interface to automagically use it from
the routines where we increase variables to some automagic reporting
in /proc ;)
(it'd be so cool if we could just start using a statistic variable
through some macro and it'd be automatically declared and visible
in /proc ;))
