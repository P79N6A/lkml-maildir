Well ... sort of. CIPSOv6 isn't actually implemented in the
labeled networking code. What you're seeing is unlabeled packets.
As far as CIPSOv4 and your WAN router, It is possible that it is
configured either to reject CIPSO packets or to allow only CIPSO
packets in a particular DOI or to enforce a CIPSO policy of its
own.

An IP operation is considered a write from the sender to the receiver.
The packet label is the label of the sender. Thus, in the unlabeled
packet case, the ambient label ("*" in your case) is attached to packet,
and the access check always denies access because of the first access
rule, which is that a subject with a star label will always be denied
access.

The smackfsdef mount option applies to files that don't actually
have the security.SMACK64 attribute. If those files have the attribute
whatever value is associated with it will be used.
Thank you.
