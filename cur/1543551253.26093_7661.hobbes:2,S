Hi Zoltan,
I have tried your patch and although it works:
# cat /proc/mtrr 
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=4096MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x00100000000 (    4096MB), size=    2048MB: write-back,
count=1
reg02: base=0xfc000000 (4032MB), size=  64MB: uncachable, count=1
unfortunately, it doesn't solve the problem. The machine is still
unbearably slow (up to 40x slower!) and one of the eepro100 interfaces is
still not working.
Another interesting idea was suggested by Mark Hemment - to switch 
memlist_add_head() -> memlist_add_tail()
in expand()/__free_pages_ok() (see mm/page_alloc.c) and it did make a
difference -- both eepro100 started to work fine but the machine remained
just as slow as before.
So, the problem is complex but I am told that Rik and others are aware
that at present there is no working support for highmem. Strangely, my
desktop dual PIII550 with 1G RAM works just fine with highmem... nice and
fast, no problems whatsoever and it is filled up with all kinds of
devices, from soundcard to bttv848, 3dfx, eepro100, ne2k, 8139 etc
etc. Everything just works.
Regards,
Tigran
