kernel_fpu_begin() is not enough for this purpose as user_*_copy may
cause pagefault and sleep in it. You should know lazy FPU swtich mechanism.
The mechanism will be confued by your your copy routine and may save
broken FPU context or another process may use broken FPU registers.
You should also care about do_page_fault like this:
do_page_fault()
{
     if (fault happens in user_*_copy) {
	   save FPU context on stack;
	   recover FPU context to the previous state;
     }
	   .........
	   .........
	   .........
     if (fault happens in user_*_copy) {
	   recover FPU context from stack;
     }
}

I guess kernel_fpu_begin() might not be heavy as many processes don't use
fpu registers so much.
Thank you,
