Recording studio quality uncompressed digital video (CCIR 601:
720x576@25Hz YUV 4:2:2; ~20 Mbyte per second[1]) for example. One minute of
video already uses ~1.2 Gbyte. It's much easier to record it to a normal
filesystem[2] instead of a raw device: you can use the standard libc file
functions to manipulate the data.

[1] 720 pixels horizontal x 576 pixels vertical x 2 bytes per pixel + 6144
    bytes padding to get to the nearest multiple of 16 kbyte (for
    performance reasons) = 835584 bytes per frame.
[2] Although you can hardly call SGI IRIX XFS with real-time partitions
    and guaranteed rate I/O a "normal filesystem".
