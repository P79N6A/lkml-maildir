I agree on not adding it.  Tom Rini is working on a version the Andrew 
seems inclined to merge.  When that happens I will most likely put 
together enhancements to it to bring it up to what this one does. 
Meanwhile I am trying to capture some of Tom's changes in this one. 
Also, it is MUCH easier for me to maintain as a seperate patch.
