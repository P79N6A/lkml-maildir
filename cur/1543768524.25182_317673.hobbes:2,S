Ok, I've just tested this.
At least with my config, if I remove both instances of UTS_VERSION from 
init/version.c, the resulting vmlinux files are exactly identical with 
the same sha1sum.
So maybe Jesper can use this to make *really* sure that there are no 
actual changes with the patches, just whitespace changes.
