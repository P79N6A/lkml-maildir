This is a technical mailing list, so let's start with technical 
arguments:
Why did this client want to use ZFS?
Because his boss was convinced by a marketing guy that ZFS was the best 
invention since sliced bread?
Or due to technical limitations in what Linux currently offers 
resulting in ZFS bringing him direct advantages on these servers?
If the latter, what exactly?

There are at about 10.000 people who contributed to the Linux kernel, 
some of them unreachable or even dead.
AFAIK the only way to relicense the Linux kernel that wouldn't be 
legally questionable in any jurisdiction would be to get each one of 
them to agree to the license change.
IOW, it's more or less practically impossible to relicense the kernel.
If the GPL is a problem for you, FreeBSD might be a good choice for you.
