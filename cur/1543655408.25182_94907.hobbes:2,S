Hello Alan,
I have tried linux-2.4.20-ac1 on my Sony Vaoi (PCG-C1MHP, a computer equipped
with a Crusoe and an ALIM 1533 ide driver). Your patches are not sufficient
enough to make the machine booting with the non-generic IDE drivers. I have
had to apply a patch sent by Ogawa Hirofumi (I don't know exactly who's
the author of this patch). Please find it enclosed at the end of this mail. 
With this setting the machine boot up correctly and the DMA are enabled.
Sincerely,
