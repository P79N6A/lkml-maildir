it's not quadratic in terms of CPU share: the first factor impacts the 
CPU share, the second factor impacts the granularity. This means that 
reniced workloads will be preempted in a more finegrained way - but 
otherwise there's _no_ quadratic effect for CPU time - which is a 
completely separate metric. Remember: there are no timeslices in CFS, so 
a task can be preempted any number of times without being at a 
disadvantage.

actually, this 'minor issue' was the main issue that caused the bug ;-)
