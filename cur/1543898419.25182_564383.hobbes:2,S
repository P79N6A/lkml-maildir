please see the thread "Re: [PATCH] fix e100 rx path on ARM (was [PATCH] e100 rx: 
or s and el bits)" which is discussing a fix for this issue and currently being 
worked.
eepro100 will *still* be removed once e100 is fixed to support those devices.
Moreover, we now also have a fix for the e100 IPMI issues on some tyan boards 
(patch coming this week!). That hopefully solves all e100 issues that are still 
open.
