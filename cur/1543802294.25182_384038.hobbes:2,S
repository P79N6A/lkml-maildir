It fixes the symptom, yes. Greg complained it's papering over the 
problem and not a real fix, which is fair enough, but ...
yes, it did seem to be a newly introduced problem in -mm1 or -mm2. To my 
mind, if we don't have a proper fix, we ought to drop the patch that 
caused the problem in the first place? Andy .. can you finger which 
patch that was, I forget ...
