I do not know if this is related, but input anyway.
I moved from RH 2.4.x kernel -> 2.6.x. kernel on my box.  After a lot of 
upgrades to most system stuff
( 
http://www.hantslug.org.uk/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?LinuxHints/RedHat_2.4_To_2.6_Kernel_Upgrade
 )
I found FDISK broke and reported wrong disk sectors etc.  A lot of Googling 
revealed it was indeed a bug of sorts (I think), and an upgrade sorted it 
(file-utils)
Now whether FDISK is used in this I do not know.
