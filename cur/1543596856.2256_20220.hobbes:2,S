Because to get that new cookie you would need another cookie; otherwise
you could violate the readdir guarantee that it'll never return files
twice.

dcache is not populated on readdir for good reasons (it would 
require reading the inodes and tie a of lot of memory) and you would need
to lock all the dcache entries belong to a directory while a nfs readdir;
tieing up even more memory. Also a readdir() is not bounded in time.
BTW; the cookie issue is not an NFS only problem. It occurs on local
IO as well. Just consider rm -rf - reading directories and in parallel
deleting them (the original poster's file system would have surely
gotten that wrong). Another tricky case is telldir().
