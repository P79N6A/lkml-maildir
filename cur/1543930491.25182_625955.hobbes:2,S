Yes, this is annoying.

Yes I was thinking about that too, but I am not brave enough to even
try to to think to the end ;)
As a minimal change, I tried to add "task_struct *leader_proxy" to
signal_struct, which points to the next live thread, and changed by
exit_notify(). eligible_child() checks it instead of ->exit_signal.
But this is so messy...
And in fact, if we are talking about group stop, it is a group operation,
why do_wait() uses per-thread ->exit_code but not ->group_exit_code ?
But yes, [PATCH 3/3] adds a visible difference, and I don't know if
this difference is good or bad.
	$ sleep 1000
	[1]+  Stopped                 sleep 1000
	$ strace -p `pidof sleep`
	Process 432 attached - interrupt to quit
Now strace "hangs" in do_wait() because ->exit_code was eaten by the
shell. We need SIGCONT.
With the "[PATCH 3/3]" strace proceeds happily.
Oleg.
