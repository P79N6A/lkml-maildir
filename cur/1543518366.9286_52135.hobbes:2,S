Hi!
I got some Oopses from NULL pointer dereferencing in kernel 2.2.13. It
happened when I worked in X-WIndows (KDE-1.1.2). Also earlier I sometimes
got sudden freezing of system under X but was unable to get any usefull 
info as I had to press reset.  This time  kwm simply died and I was able to
get info about oopses.
Kernel 2.2.13 were built with egcs-1.1.2
I'm sending output of ksymoops and kernel .config file in attachment
