The requirement makes sense, I guess.
Regarding the implementation: if we add
	unsigned char coredump_omit_anon_memory:1;
into the mm_struct right next to `dumpable' then we avoid increasing the
size of the mm_struct, and the code gets neater.
Modification of this field is racy, and we don't have a suitable lock in
mm_struct to fix that.  I don't think we care about that a lot, but it'd be
best to find some way of fixing it.
Really we should convert binfmt_aout.c and any other coredumpers too.
Does this feature have any security implications?  For example, there might
be system administration programs which force a coredump on a "bad"
process, and leave the core somewhere for the administrator to look at. 
With this change, we permit hiding of that corefile's anon memory from the
administrator.  OK, lame example, but perhaps there are better ones.
