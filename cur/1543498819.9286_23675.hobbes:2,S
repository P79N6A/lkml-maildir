It does _not_ the same thing. You don't know at wakeup time which will be
the CPU that will get the task. You don't know which will be its prev->mm.

This is true also using FIFO.

(2) is not true. It may be close to the real best task though.

You can avoid starvation even with FIFO behaviour. BTW I noticed now that
currently (in 2.3.6) we are doing a _FIFO_ wakeup even in accept(2) (my
2.2.x patch was doing LIFO in accpet(2) instead). the EXCLUSIVE tasks
sleeping in accept(2) instead _must_ be wakenup in a LIFO behaviour.
There's no starvation issue with accept and with LIFO we'll get a sure
better caching behaviour. Is somebody going to fix this problem? (I can do
that myself otherwise). I think we have two options:
1) add two waitqueues in the network layer, one for select() and one for
   accept(), then replace the add_wait_queue_exclusive with add_wait_queue
   in the wait_for_connect().
2) the other option is to add a secondary lists in the waitqueue, so
   then we'll be able to choose between putting task at the top or at the
   bottom of the list, even when we must support a wake-all in the same
   waitqueue (as in accept(2)).

You still don't know which will be the CPU that will reschedule the task.
When you do spin_unlock then the other CPU will enter in schedule before
you, even if you'll schedule someway a bit after the wake_up (and it's
not obvious that you'll schedule after the wake_up).

PS. Now I am running with the FIFO wakeup in the seamphores (previous
patch with add_wait_queue_exclusive() instead of add_wait_queue()) and
it's running fine.
