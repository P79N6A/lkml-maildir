IPv6 is only the bottom layer of the stack. TCP does a lot lot more.

That depends on where your overheads are. Remember that for every direct
access you make you trade off kernel syscall overhead against userspace
scheduling and locking overhead. 
The VI architecture tries to design well to handle this I've not seen enough
about infiniband to know that. The 'better performance' is an assumption that
isnt always as simple as it seems - especially with high mtu values and
real world applications
