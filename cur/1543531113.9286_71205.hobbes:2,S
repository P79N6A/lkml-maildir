NOPE - runaway memory allocators can still cause OOM crashes.

NOPE - additional swap space does not make it more sluggish in and of itself.
I guaranteed the space that is allocated to processes. If the processes don't
use it, there is no additional overhead. If the processes DO use it then they
won't be aborted by OOM conditions.
If you prefer a crash to degraded performance, you are welcome to it. I want
a way to control it.

With the current state of Linux, no matter how much memory you put, you
will still get OOM situation whenever processes want more memory than
you have. You can't avoid it. You can't prevent it. You can't control it.
