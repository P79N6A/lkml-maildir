Well, the compiler is really being dumb about -Os and in fact it's
giving bigger code, so I'm not really getting what I ask for.  
With my gcc at least (x86_64, gcc (GCC) 4.1.3 20070812 (prerelease)
(Ubuntu 4.1.2-15ubuntu2)) and Andi's example:
#include <string.h>
f(char x[6]) {
        memset(x, 1, 6);
}
compiling with -O2 gives
0000000000000000 <f>:
   0:	c7 07 01 01 01 01    	movl   $0x1010101,(%rdi)
   6:	66 c7 47 04 01 01    	movw   $0x101,0x4(%rdi)
   c:	c3                   	retq   
and compiling with -Os gives
0000000000000000 <f>:
   0:	48 83 ec 08          	sub    $0x8,%rsp
   4:	ba 06 00 00 00       	mov    $0x6,%edx
   9:	be 01 00 00 00       	mov    $0x1,%esi
   e:	e8 00 00 00 00       	callq  13 <f+0x13>
  13:	5a                   	pop    %rdx
  14:	c3                   	retq   
so the code gets bigger and worse in every way.
