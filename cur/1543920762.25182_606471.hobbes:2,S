OK. I'll remove the ARC=ppc parts.

Why? Documentation/powerpc/booting-without-of.txt says for I2C interfaces
device_type is required and should be "i2c". Is this no longer true?

CPM2 i2c seems to be the same. However, i have no way to test this.

I noticed cpm1_set_pin32, but this function don't seem to set the
odr register. Will this be added? Then it would be:
	{CPM_PORTB, 26, CPM_PIN_OUTPUT | CPM_PIN_OPENDRAIN},
	{CPM_PORTB, 27, CPM_PIN_OUTPUT | CPM_PIN_OPENDRAIN},

It's in fact 0x7F << 1. The same value is used in the 2.4 driver and
in u-boot, as well. Slave operation is not supported.

With the suggested change to use fsl,cpm-command, the driver should
be able to use  both cpm1 and cpm2. The operation and structs for i2c
are identical. The only difference might be the hack^wsupport for
relocation.
Thanks,
