Yes, I believe Simon is alive and well. (but busy, as we all are)

I am communicating with Intel guys from time to time and there are some
interesting changes from Intel in the pipeline to update the driver, but I
thought it is worthwhile to cleanup and throw away unnecessary bits before
applying a major update (otherwise we would be wasting time debugging an
update to code which is no longer needed).
As for the microcode data itself, no, I haven't received anything new from
Intel yet but please be patient. I have received unofficial latest
"hacked"  version of microcode data from someone (outside Intel) but it
will not be uploaded because it will cause support problems both to Intel
and myself.
I find it is wiser to be friendly with Intel than to annoy them with
constant questions "where is the latest microcode data" :)
Kind regards
Tigran
