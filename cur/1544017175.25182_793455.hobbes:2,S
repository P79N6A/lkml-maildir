Good, but....
Now I have made a new patch for cleanupping all the similar codes in btrfs.
This patch has been tested in VM, it seems ok.
Now should I  rebuild another patch which based the previous patch,
or could you be able to reverse the previous patch then I just post
this new patch including all stuff?
Sorry I am not much familiar with the posting flow, and I am not sure
the meaning of "queued".
