Either I'm blind, or especially dense today, or both (quite possible :-) but I
don't see any reference in patch-kernel to the extra version information.
EXTRAVERSION is defined in the kernel Makefile, and I tried using the script
found in the 2.4.0-test1 source like this:
patch-kernel /usr/src/linux /pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/test-kernels
but the test-2 and following patches are not applied.  All I get is "Current
kernel version is 2.4.0."  What am I missing?

Wayne,
The versions of patch-kernel included in 2.3/2.4 support extra version
information, so patches from Linus and others (i.e. Alan Cox) can be applied
if proper information is placed in the kernel Makefile.
