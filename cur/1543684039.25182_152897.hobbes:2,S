Applied mm1, kj1 (kernel-janitor), and your O11.1int patch.
when X is niced with -10, there are a 1-2 sec pause whenever I switched
from X to console.
when X is niced with 0, there are no skips, no pause, no whatsoever.
even when I maximise aterm, there are no interruptions on my xmms when
i hide, and unhide aterm. nothing unusual when i compile kernels. 
this is perhaps the best patch i ever applied from you.
Cheers,
Eugene
