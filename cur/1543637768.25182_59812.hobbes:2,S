Well, there's 16 cpus and 8 ioapics to theoretically go into that 
space. The trouble is that it's not really one physical address 
space globally, it's one per node, so the whole thing's a total hack.

The strangest thing to me is that all the IDs are 0, when they
weren't to start with. Something's corrupting memory ... I'd
happily blame my own code, but allegedly this has happened without
CONFIG_MULTIQUAD too.

Yeah, OK ... that's my fault. This is the physical space, and
we should really look up the physical ID of each device and put
into into a per-quad mapping. But that works just fine as a hack
without the NR_CPUs parameter, and it's only an exclusion thing
anyway, so even if a CPU doesn't come online it's correct enough.
The real question is why does this work if NR_CPUS is 32, but not
if we take it down somewhat? Likely one of the arrays is getting
overshot, but we need to do some debug to find out where & why.

No denying that, but it takes a fearless man to stare into the
eyes of Intel's IOAPIC and survive ;-) I barely survived the last
time, and am not desperately keen to do it again ... <runs away>
