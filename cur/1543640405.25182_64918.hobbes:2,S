the default will be something sane, ie. probably larger than 32K. There is
safe code in glibc to catch your old applications from doing any
stupidity, then you can change pid_max or just upgrade your system (like
you did with the kernel). It's not a big dependency to require the setting
of pid_max if you want binary compatibility with rare old stuff.
