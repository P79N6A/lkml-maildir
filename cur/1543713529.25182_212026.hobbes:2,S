Some of those ENOMEM panics in save_highmem_zone() look like they might
need proper handling instead?
The 256 byte automatic array in read_swapfiles() may bring you a visit from
the stack space police, although I don't think it's really a problem.  256
bytes for a pathname may be a bit excessive though.
Please send me an update patch sometime which makes all the new code go
away again if !CONFIG_HIGHMEM.
Thanks.
