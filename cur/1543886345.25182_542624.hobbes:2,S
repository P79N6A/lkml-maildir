Subject: PCI changed from 2.6.10-rc1 to 2.6.10-rc2. help needed.

I'm trying to get the Brooktrout TR1034 fax card to run with
Linux-2.6.21, but it just won't run, so I downgraded to 2.6.9 and it
seems to load just fine. Then I tried 2.6.10-rc1, and with a few
changes, it seems to work. But, when I tried 2.6.10-rc2, it failed.
Here's what I patched to make it run from 2.6.9 to 2.6.10-rc1.
I need some guidance to try to get the card to work, hopefully with
2.6.21 eventually.
Is this possible? It seems the PCI layer has changed quite a lot and I
doubt a quick patch can do the job. I can get the module to compile
and load, but since other bits are in binary, I've no way to confirm
that they're ok. It's tough to get vendor to do a 2.6.21. version.
Thanks,
Jeff.
