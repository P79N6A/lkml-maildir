If a longname exists it is definitive - don't make it a symlink to the short
name. Only programs which explitly support long filenames under Windows can
create them. The short name is then generated as a kludge by windows to allow
non-long filename aware programs to access the file. No long-filename aware
windows program should access any file by its short name, except backup
software and file managers. Windows software doesn't care what the short name
is so why should we?
If having the short name alias show up in directory listing is deemed
nessisary (but why - there are no UNIX programs with a long filename brain
deficit...) the short name should be a symlink to the long name.
