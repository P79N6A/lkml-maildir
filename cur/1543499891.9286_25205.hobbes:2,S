I think the QLinux addition are very useful for realtime-multimedia content,
but actually Linux has some limitations regarding locking,
which makes impossible for example to play real-time generated audio with
20ms latency.
So unfortunately Linux + QLinux additions can not be called media-OS.
a typical software synthesizer performs
while(1)
{
  read() from MIDI port (or serial port)
  Do computations to generate audio data
  write() to audio card  ( small buffer <20ms)
}
to ensure that is works ok, 
the read() path from the MIDI port and the write() path to the /dev/dsp must
be completely independent from any I/O kernel locking due to disk I/O.
Only these changes will allow *STABLE* working realtime software synthesizers
to run on Linux.
Do you think that we will archieve this goal in not so distant future on Linux ?
Do you know if the filesystem changes in linux 2.3.7 give better results  than
previous kernels ?
I don't benchmarked it already, because I must get a spare disk for testing,
to avoid potential corruption.
When I will get some numbers I will post the results.
To note that I benchmarked RT processes wich do only
while(1)
{
  waste_cpu_time
  usleep(3000);
}
and ran the disk I/O stresstests in the background,
the results are disappointing:
scheduling latencies of up to 150ms !!
:-(
seems that we must decouple the usleep() path from disk I/O too.
I tested the 2.2.10-andrea-VM6 patch:
this guy amazes me every time, he archieved the BEST and WORST results together:
:-)
the numbers in the table are max latencies, and (num of buffer overruns) 
this is a snip of the results of 2.2.10-andrea-VM6 kernel
--------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
buffer size   |proc (top)   | disk write    | disk copy   | disk read    |
--------------+-------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
2x1024(11.6ms)| 15.1ms (307)| 9610.0ms (221)| 20.5ms (  2)| 867.3ms ( 10)|
3x1024(17.4ms)| 14.7ms (  0)|  545.7ms (141)| 23.1ms (  2)|1298.1ms (  6)|
4x1024(23.2ms)| 14.7ms (  0)| 8862.4ms ( 95)| 18.1ms (  0)| 228.6ms ( 12)|
2x2048(23.2ms)| 20.4ms (  0)|10255.4ms (120)| 16.9ms (  0)| 172.2ms (  9)|
a standard 2.2.9 kernel gives me:
--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
buffer size   |proc (top)   | disk write  | disk copy   | disk read   |
--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
2x1024(11.6ms)| 22.8ms (313)| 57.4ms (  7)| 31.5ms ( 16)| 94.8ms ( 17)|
3x1024(17.4ms)| 32.5ms (  1)| 57.3ms (  4)| 36.3ms (  8)| 98.1ms (  8)|
4x1024(23.2ms)| 27.5ms (  1)| 59.8ms (  3)| 36.3ms (  5)| 92.2ms (  4)|
2x2048(23.2ms)| 21.4ms (  0)| 57.8ms (  3)| 42.2ms (  8)|102.5ms (  5)|
the andrea patch behaves very well during disk copy (cp file1 file2) operations,
but on write only , or read only operations , it gives extremely high
latencies.

One day in the future the audio layer has to run without the kernel lock.
However by then its likely to be ALSA. Getting the SMP locking right will
be fun, I dont think its worth repeating the effort for dead code (ie OSS),
nor will it help you anyway as your lock understanding isnt quite right

I heard of some tests that show that a SGI is capable of playing audio with 5ms
latency during high system-load.
SGI kernel is monolithic,so I think Linux should allow <20ms latencies, on
modern PC hardware, because actually the hardware *IS CAPABLE* of this.
