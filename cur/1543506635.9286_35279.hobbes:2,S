Erich Boleyn doesn't have time anymore, but it's being worked on by
some of the Hurd people.  See 
http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub.html.
There's a mailing list and a CVS repo available.
I looked at teaching our bootstrap about the "Multiboot" format that
GRUB likes.  We'd have to move all of the setup done by 16-bit code
into setup_arch, which wouldn't be that bad except that part of it
calls back to the BIOS.  Probably the APM code could be adapted to do
that.  GRUB will probe memory (same as david parsons' experimental
memmap patch) but it won't do any of the other probing.
It'd be really great if we could do this, because the zImage, bzImage,
etc. nonsense would just disappear and `vmlinux' would be bootable,
gzipped or not.
