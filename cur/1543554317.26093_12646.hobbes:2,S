It seems that no one on that thread thought about using the Linux Trace
Toolkit which would allow you to do exactly what is asked for. Plus,
there's a basic hooking mechanism than enables you to hook onto any
file-system events and then do what you want with that.
In the case of trapping open() or stat() you'd only need to:
1) Patch the kernel with the LTT patch
2) Write a kernel module that uses the hooking interface to hook
onto system call entries and filter those out as needed. Moreover,
you could also hook onto file-system events which would give you
greater detail about the file-system related system calls occurring.
Eventually, I'd like to see item #1 disappear and the tracing patches
admitted part of the kernel tree. Other OSes have had such a capability
for a very long time. This, by itself, doesn't justify including it,
but it certainly does go to show usefulness. Moreover, Alan has suggested
that this might be a good way to implement C2 security into the kernel
since all system entries are monitored.
That said, here's an example module that could be a basis for trapping
open() and stat(). Although, it could be used to monitor other events:
#define MODULE
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/trace.h>
int my_callback(uint8_t pmEventID,
		void*   pmStruct)
{
  trace_syscall_entry* syscall_event = (trace_syscall_entry*) pmStruct;
  printk("System call %d occured at address 0x%08X \n",
         syscall_event->syscall_id,
         syscall_event->address);
}
int init_module(void)
{
  printk("callback initialized \n");
 
  trace_register_callback(&my_callback,
			  TRACE_EV_SYSCALL_ENTRY);
 
  return 0;
}
void cleanup_module(void)
{
  trace_unregister_callback(&my_callback,
			    TRACE_EV_SYSCALL_ENTRY);
}
The only "problem" here being that you can't specify "open" or "stat" as
strings, but as their respective system call ID as seen in arch/i386/entry.S
for the i386. Note the patches available now include support for the PowerPC.
If anyone is interested in adding support for other architectures, feel
free to dig in.
