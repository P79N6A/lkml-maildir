I just gave a test to this last Andrea's patch and I am surprised!
I plugged it in our university's PKS server (right now running
horowitz/hironobu pks server) with an _enormous_ database (sleepycat)
of five 280Mb. files plus some other.
I have never seen it doing incrementals that fast!
Congratulations Andrea!
P.S. there are some problems in raid5.c with 'b_next' field no longer
defined.
