Thanks for trying to help, however, that's not going to work this way, sorry.
1. "sin" is cleared a few lines above, so you end up comparing 0.0.0.0
   against "ifa->ifa_address".
2. two interfaces can have the same configured address, your patch might
   end up returning the wrong address. You'd need to write && where you
   wrote ||, and you'd need to save the old address.
See the patch that I sent.
