Any use of an explicit or implied blocking mutex across threads with differing
priorities can results in priority inversion problems. The real problem, however,
is contention. If you get rid of the contention in a certain critical section,
you then also get rid of latency in the system. They are one and the same problem.

It's to decouple the system from various time related problems with jitter.
It's critical to use this since the nature of Linus is so temporally coarse
that these techniques must be used to "smooth" over latency problems in the
Linux kernel.
I personally would love to see these audio applications run on a first-class
basis under Linux. Unfortunately, that won't happen until it gets near real
time support prevasively through the kernel just like in SGI's IRIX. Multimedia
applications really need to be under a hard real time system with special
scheduler support so that CPU resources, IO channels can be throttled.
The techniques Linux media folks are using now are basically a coarse hack
to get things basically working. This won't change unless some fundamental
concurrency issues (moving to a preemptive kernel with interrupt threads, etc..)
change in Linux. Scattering preemption points manually over 2.6 is starting to
look unmanable from all of the stack traces I've been reading in these latency
related threads.
That's all. :)
