Ok, its like you're rebooting, correct?

That's because your address range for the ROM isn't mapped - when Linux
starts on ARM, it unmaps virtually everything, and remaps only the address
ranges it wants to use.

Essentially, you have 2 choices:
1. Turn off the MMU.
2. insert a 1:1 physical to virtual mapping for the ROM and call the code.
   (with interrupts disabled).
Which one works depends on what the ROM code requires.
There is an example of (1) in the current ARM kernel sources - the RiscPC
port uses this method to reboot - we can't activate the hardware reset line
on these machines, so our only option is to use this method.
