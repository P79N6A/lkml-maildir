Hi Petr,
Thanks for the suggestion.
What you pointed out was the source of the problem. After
enabling the  MSI-to-HTInterrupts(the value at offset 0xF6),
I now see interrupts and can ping in both MSI and MSI-X modes.

I do not think that erratum #78 is related to this - it is related to tunnel
itself generating MSI - which is not needed in this case.

Can you provide 'lspci -vvvxxx' output from AMD8132 bridge?  (esp. bytes
0xF4-0xFF from config space of 1022:7458 devices)  By default dword at 0xF4
is
0xA8000008, disabling MSI/MSI-X mapping -> hypertransport interrupts.
Changing
this to 0xA8010008 should enable this translation (iff qword at 0xF8 is
0x0000FEE00000), allowing MSI to work on respective secondary/subordinate
busses.  Unfortunately kernel ignores these HT capabilities...
