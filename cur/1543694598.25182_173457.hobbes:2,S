Man's suggestion of CONFIG_ISA=y did solve the problem. I can't figure out how 
it was turned off, though. I just noticed several config options got disabled 
on this test kernel.
I wasn't running make oldconfig, though - I'm always running make menuconfig. 
Until now that was always saving my previous options (I've been trying every 
2.6.0-testx version) so I was assuming it was the right way to do it :-)
