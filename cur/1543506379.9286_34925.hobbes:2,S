I've always run gpm and X no problem.

That is only good if you don't care if gpm is running.  I have X
running all the time, and I use 8 consoles as well as an X
session 24/7.  Shutting down gpm prior to starting X up, would
mean permanently shutting down gpm.  That means I lose the
functionality of gpm.  This does not solve any problem, but
rather creates a new one:  no gpm.
I *NEED* gpm for cut and paste on the console, and X *MUST* be
running simultaneously too.  I never get lockups at all.  I do
get those pesky errors printed in /var/log/messages all day long
though.

Yes, my mouse is working ok.  There are still numerous errors in
syslog though.

I'm using 2.2.11 right now.  Here are some of the messages that I
received:
Aug 15 21:55:14 asdf gpm[452]: Extra byte = 0f
Aug 15 21:55:14 asdf gpm[452]: Extra byte = 02

Aug 15 21:55:14 asdf gpm[452]: Extra byte = 0f
Aug 15 21:55:15 asdf gpm[452]: Extra byte = 00
I switched to 2.2.11 on August 13th, so these log entries are for
2.2.11.
I'm using a "Logitech Mouseman+ Wheel", the four button one.  I'm
using "mman" as the driver type for it right now.
What is the recommended driver?  RedHat's mouseconfig sets it to
"pnp".  It works but spews errors to syslog.  If I boot 2.0.37
with RedHat 5.2, the mouse works fine and no errors are reported
- with the exact same configuration.

Not an option for me.  I just want my mouse to work (which it
does), and no errors to be put in syslog, as there is nothing
wrong with my mouse.  Linux and/or gpm and/or X is foobar.  I'm
using SVGA Xserver with a Cirrus Logic 5446 PCI card...
