You can find ALL sources for RedHat's kernel on CD with sources in source rpm
for that kernel (it's kernel-*.src.rpm, NOT kernel-source-*.xxx.rpm !).
There are tarball from ftp.kernel.org, all additions and patches and .spec file
where you can find about building process (if you have enough *nix expirience
then you can understood what's written there even without reading Maximum RPM
from www.rpm.org :-)
