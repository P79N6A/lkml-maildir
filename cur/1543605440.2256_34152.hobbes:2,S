As binfmt_misc write access is root only, I didnt care to check
too much as root can shoot himself anyway. Some places could use

Err, who said that it is the same?? Its sufficient, if you trust
root to just pass '0' or '1'. Ok, its probably too clever for the

get a long with guys like me.

Just get Linus to take the -ac version then. I'm sick to read
your comments about binfmt_misc over and over again. You've
made your point(s) - more than one time. Thats enough. Welcome
to my killfile now.
