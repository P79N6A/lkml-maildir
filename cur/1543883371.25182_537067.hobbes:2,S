This seems to be related to suspend to disk. After the first suspend
to disk/resume, suspend to ram stops resuming from lid open and needs
me to hit the power button. As I just started using suspend to disk in
the past couple weeks, this may be a long-standing bug.
I think it's still present in -rc7-mm1 but I don't have my laptop
handy to double-check.
