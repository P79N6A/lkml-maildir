Hi,
When I first installed 2.4, someone told me that if I had 1 gb ram it 
was better to not use highmem because those extra aditional mb was not 
worth the speed penalty of using the feature.
Sorry for my ignorance (and my sucking english) but must I enable 
highmem now with 2.6? or have it any speed penalty althought?
Thanks a lot!
