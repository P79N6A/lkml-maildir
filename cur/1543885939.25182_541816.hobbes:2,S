Erk, I hadn't realized how extended call_usermodehelper had become.
call_usermodehelper_pipe()?  Erk.  Grepping... for core dumping via a
process?  Without modifying the ELF core dumper (at least) to handle
short writes?  Why not dump it in an agreed location and exec the
process with that as an arg?
When did this go in?  2.6.19... hmm, too late to rip it out I guess 8(
Anyway, I'm not sure exposing an open-ended interface wins: refactoring
internally definitely makes sense though.
Rusty.
