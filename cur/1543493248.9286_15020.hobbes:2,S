	Hello All,  I just got done doing an exhausting search of the
	compaq web-site manuals sections & have been unable to find
	manuals concerning the physical layer .  I did see lots of
	stuff on sales pitches , but nothing concrete on the hardware
	(IE: switch settings meanings , options available ,... )
	I am hoping someone whom owns/ed a 1500r may still have a
	.pdf file covering this system and be willing to allow access
	to it ftp/www/... ?
		Tia, JimL
