Kernel size (footprint in memory) would grow a tad bit (not much), but
it's overall speed would also go up.

That wasn't the case in Torvalds' sample code which started this
thread.  That was spin-locking code, I believe.  Of course, in that
case, there was no need for an inline function or anything, but rather
restructuring of an if statement.

If the kernel developer "knows" always that they have to follow the
stack order when adding additional cases, it's fine.  But it is more
obvious in the patch I wrote what is going on than in the original
"goto" version of the code with the fs/open.c code someone asked me to
look at.  This makes it harder for people unfamiliar with the complete
linux kernel design in this area to get started.  Of course, I'm getting
a crash course it seems.
