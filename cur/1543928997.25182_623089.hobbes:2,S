Found some interesting things, the delays are caused by
 1) throttle_vm_writeout()
     I removed it, Andrew worries about that, but hopefully there's a
     better solution to his worries
 2) atime updates
     my uml image did not have them turned off
 3) UML timer tick does not seem very reliable, here's what the below
    patch outputs during writing.  It shows the delay between ticks in
    milliseconds:
[42949415.110000] zzz - 267
[42949415.120000] zzz - 862
[42949415.130000] zzz - 71
[42949415.140000] zzz - 599
[42949415.170000] zzz - 3746
[42949415.190000] zzz - 2961
[42949415.200000] zzz - 3272
[42949415.210000] zzz - 253
[42949415.220000] zzz - 1692
[42949415.230000] zzz - 823
[42949415.280000] zzz - 344
[42949415.310000] zzz - 224
I guess, the ubd interrupts confuse the timekeeping somehow, but the
details are unclear.
