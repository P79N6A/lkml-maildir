Hi all,
as I reported before (see here: 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0503.3/0975.html
 or
here: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/3/28/38
 ) -- there is a reboot problem
under 2.6.x
kernels with VIA EPIA MS boards.
Now I have found that kernels 2.4.x seem to work well under different 
reboot combinations (apm=on|off acpi=on|off reboot=b|w) i tried so far.
So, it looks like problem is rather specific to kernels 2.6.x only.
No idea why though.
P.S. Thank you for Cc answers to me.
