Hmmm.... We should call this MODE_BARRIER I guess...

The question is what does fence imply for the order of the atomic 
operation. Will the operation be performed before or after the barrier? 
Or do we need barriers on both sides?
If so then we may simulate that with a release and then do a acquire load 
afterwards
	 cmpxchg_rel(m, old, new);
	 return *m;	/* m volatile so it has acquire semantics */
