I didn't get this too much, because I don't understand the FF layer well so
far. How is this going to work? Let's say, we have 3 torque values computed
in US, and this structure:
struct ff_effect {
    __u16 direction;
    struct ff_trigger trigger;
    struct ff_replay replay;
    struct ff_constant_effect {
        __s16 level;
 	struct ff_envelope {
   	     __u16 attack_length;
    	     __u16 attack_level;
   	     __u16 fade_length;
     	     __u16 fade_level;
	};
    };
};
and need to pass the three 16bits torques into s16 ioaddr[0..2]. How?

It's a memless device -- values written into pci space are immediately felt
in FF (it's just PLX chip interface to some their proprietary chip or somewhat).

I won't force any of mentioned solutions, but this seems the simplest one in
my eyes.
thanks for clues,
