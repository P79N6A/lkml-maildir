ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1006, ANSI/IEEE Std 1003.1, 1996 Edition:
	"The following terms and symbols used in this part of ISO/IEC 9945
	are defined in the C Standard {2}: ... time_t."
{2} is ISO/IEC 9899; 1990, the ANSI C standard.
1003.1 mentions a 32-bit integer time_t at least twice;
p 377, B2, "General Terms", "Epoch":
	"Since the issue of time_t overflowing a 32-bit integer occurs
	well before that time, both of these will have to be addressed
	in revisions to POSIX.1".
p 449, B 4.5.1 "Get System Time":
	"Implementations in which time_t is a 32-bit signed integer (most
	historical implementations) will fail in the year 2038. This version
	of POSIX.1 does not address this problem. However, the use of the
	new time_t type is mandated in order to ease this eventual fix".
