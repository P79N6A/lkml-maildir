FYI to all -- 
As a reminder. the Promise hardware programs registers when it receives
a SET FEATURES - XFER MODE.
If data transfer is occurring on OTHER ports at the time this is issued,
then data corruption is guaranteed to occur.  Polling will not fix this
problem -- all ports need to be inactive, when a SET FEATURES - XFER
MODE command is issued for any port.
