bogomips kraxel ~# modinfo bttv | grep debug
parm:        bttv_debug int, description "debug messages, default is 0 (no)"
parm:        irq_debug int, description "irq handler debug messages, default is 0 (no)"
That likely doesn't help you througth.  SCERR is a syncronisation error
of the DMA engine.  Most likely the bt878 chip has problems to do
PCI-PCI transfers to the onboard video chipset for some reason.
