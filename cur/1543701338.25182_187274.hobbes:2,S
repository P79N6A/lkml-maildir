Hi,
After banging on an e100 card for about ten minutes with a ~60kpps stream,
the interface stops receiving packets.  Interrupts come in once every few
seconds (from /proc/interrupts), but no packets are received anymore at all.
Lots of slab corruption messages in the syslog that were generated during
that packet stream (see other email I sent.)  Stopping the packet stream
still leaves the interface unusable.  'ifconfig eth1 down ; ifconfig eth1 up'
seems to fix things.
Clues?
thanks,
Lennert
