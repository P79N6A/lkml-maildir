vger runs vmailer.  And, I believe, less than half of the exploders run
sendwhale.

We use qmail to explode vger, and apart from the numbers in /proc/net/dev
increasing a bit quicker than usual we haven't noticed significant load
increases at all.
The short-term solution is more exploders (although I suspect that there
are only one or two significant domains remaining).
The longer-term solution is a fast, majordomo-compatible distributed list
server.
