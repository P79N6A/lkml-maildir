Subject: [PATCH] Missed "," character in printf in print_delayacct().
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/10/201

Sorry I've removed "," character from Documentation/accounting/getdelays.c
with taskstats-add-context-switch-counters.patch.
It is needed to turn it back.
