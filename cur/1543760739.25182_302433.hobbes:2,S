Someone said they were going to submit those shorter strings that the
kernel has, back to sf.net.  Guess that didn't happen yet, and is the
main reason I can't just sync up all the time with that repository.
Oh well, we'll be dropping support for the pci.ids file by the end of
the year or so, so it's not that big of a deal.
