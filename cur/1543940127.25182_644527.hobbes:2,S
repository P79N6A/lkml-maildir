No the other callbacks need to work in the sense that they can be called. 
You could have them do nothing after an invalidate_all().
But you cannot release the allocated structs needed for list traversal 
etc.

You would need to release the resources when the release notifier is 
called.

Hmmm.... Okay did not think about that. Then you would need to do a 
synchronize_rcu() in invalidate_all()?
