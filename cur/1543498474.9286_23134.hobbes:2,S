Subject: SPARCstation's power led goes off upon kernel init

I have a SparcStation 2 (sun4c, running debian 2.1, with libc6 2.1.1) and
upon booting a 2.2 (2.2.9 in this case) kernel the power led on the
machine goes off during the kernel init (at the same instance as the three
keyboard led's flash). This problem does not appear with 2.0.35, just 2.2
kernels. Upon asking if the similar had happend to others I received
several replies from people running on various sparc variations (at least
sun4c and sun4m, running debian 2.1, redhat 5.2, and redhat 6.0) that this
was occuring to their boxen running 2.2 kernels. Finally, someone noted
that this has been a problem since ~2.1.111, and just has never been
fixed. Is this true? Is there a real reason that this hasn't been fixed,
or has no one working on sparc explicits noticed this? I just find this
really strange (I wouldn't have even thought the kernel could control
the power led, but I guess that it can).
Thanks for any pointers!
curiously,
