Hi guys,
we discused it on bluez mailing list and this looks like your problem:
usb 3-1: USB disconnect, address 4
usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 5
input: USB HID v1.11 Keyboard [0a12:1000] on usb-0000:00:1d.2-1
input: USB HID v1.11 Mouse [0a12:1000] on usb-0000:00:1d.2-1
notas:/home/cijoml# hid2hci
Switching device 0a12:1000 to HCI mode failed (Invalid or incomplete multibyte 
or wide character)
----
Dongle is switched normally to HCI mode
Thanks for fixing
Michal
