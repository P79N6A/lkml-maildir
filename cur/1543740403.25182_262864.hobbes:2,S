That more/less falls out of the PI mechanism. Though it
appears conserving per-mutex data footprint and O(1)
behavior are going to be at odds.

I myself wonder whether Ingo is 1 or N people.

A task holding several mutexes shouldn't be an issue.
Though per task an ownership list needs to be maintained
in descending priority order such that the effective PI
can be resolved from all task owned mutexes.
Also a multiple ownership model is needed for the case of
shared-reader locks. This results in a list of owners
where the list element can maintain per-mutex task ownership
as well as per-task mutex ownerships.
It is tempting to re-implement the wheel here but existing
works are well on their way:
