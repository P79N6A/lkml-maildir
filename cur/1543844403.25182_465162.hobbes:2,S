The whole point is to defer those frees to a task. In -rt call_rcu() is 
abused to do that in the case of put_task_struct(). But it is abuse since 
call_rcu() is much more resourcefull than simply defering to a task.
Paul's idea behind de-RCU'ing put_task_struct() is mostly performance and 
partly readability because the extra RCU protection isn't needed.
So the answer is:
Make a general softirq to which free's can be defered from atomic regions, 
don't abuse call_rcu().
