Drive:
hdd: HP COLORADO 8GB, ATAPI TAPE drive
Bootup messages:
hdd: overriding capabilities->speed (assuming 650KB/sec)
hdd: overriding capabilities->max_speed (assuming 650KB/sec)
hdd <-> ht0, 650KBps, 16*32kB buffer, 3200kB pipeline, 250ms tDSC
On 2.0.36 (RedHat), we get these messages occaisonally and the backup then
fails:
hdd: I/O error, pc = a, key = 2, asc = 4, ascq = 1
hdd: I/O error, pc = 10, key = 2, asc = 4, ascq = 1
Couldn't write a filemark
hdd: I/O error, pc = 1, key = 2, asc = 4, ascq = 1
Rewinding tape failed
hdd: I/O error, pc = a, key = 2, asc = 4, ascq = 1
hdd: I/O error, pc = 10, key = 2, asc = 4, ascq = 1
Couldn't write a filemark
hdd: I/O error, pc = 1, key = 2, asc = 4, ascq = 1
Rewinding tape failed
Any idea as to the decoding?  I'm suspecting "tape full" for the filemark,
but don't know why rewind would fail.
