Subject: 2.4.18 scsi tape wait for completion

If I try to offline a tape the tape ejects but the mt command hangs,
if I then reload the tape the mt command completes.
I see in st.c/do_load_unload that the st_do_scsi command has the do_wait
argument set to TRUE, is this correct?  I fixed my problem bu setting it
to FALSE.
