Yes, of course :-)                                                    
What I am seeing over here is that aic7xxx is _significantly_ slower  
than symbios _in the exact same context_. I refused to use the "new"  
driver as long as possible because I had (right from the first test)  
the "feeling" that it hurts the machine overall performance in some   
way, meaning the box seems _slow_ and less responsive than it was with
the old aic driver. When I directly compared it with symbios (LSI     
Logic hardware sold from Tekram) I additionaly found out, that it     
seems to hurt the interrupt performance of a network card sharing its 
interrupt with the aic which again does not happen with symbios. I    
have already seen such behaviour before, on merely every driver I     
formerly wrote for shared interrupt systems I had to fill in code that
_prevents_ lockout of other interrupt users due to indefinitely       
walking through the own code in high load situation.                  
But, of course, you _know_ this. Nobody writes a driver like new      
aic7xxx _and_ doesn't know :-)                                        
My guess is that this knowledge made you enter the comment I ripped   
from your code about using bottom half handler instead of dealing with
workload in a hardware interrupt. Again, I have to no extent read your
code completely or the like. I simply tried to find the hardware      
interrupt routine and look if it does significant eli (EverLasting    
Interrupt ;-) stuff - and I found your comment.                       
Can you re-comment from todays point of view?

In a nutshell:                                                        
a) long lasting interrupt workloads prevent normal process activity   
(creating latency and sticky behaviour)                               
b) long lasting interrupt workloads play bad on other interrupt users 
(e.g. on the same shared interrupt)                                   
I can see _both_ comparing aic with symbios.
