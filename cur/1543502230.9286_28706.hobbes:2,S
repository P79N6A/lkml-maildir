Whats the memory bus speed, whats the cache speed, whats the cache
size (L1/L2/L3) etc etc, how much junk do you want down there.

So you are saying that people should rewrite all existing tools so it
can be made easy for you to write a useless bells'n'whistles tool to
display things? No thank you very much.

Oh how, you mean that all CPUs that provide something "VIS"-like
should report it as VIS? If you want to program something architecture
specific like VIS or MMX, then you already have to know how to deal
with it.
