Yes, right, but your patch does not solve that, too, right?
Someone else will have to do that one.
Rather than adding up-to 4M of nonsave pagetables, turning off
paging might be solution there. 
And this will actually help. If we move saving few statments before,
we'll have identity mapping so we can turn paging off...

Hmmm, right. Well, it should work anyway because this is
same in new and old kernel, so I'd still like some testing.
