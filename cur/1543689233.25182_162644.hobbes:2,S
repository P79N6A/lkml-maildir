That's curious, I don't have an explanation for why 438MB should be
repeatably significant on your 256MB system.  I'm pretty sure tmpfs
itself doesn't have any "438MB" coded into it!  Maybe it tended to
to horrible seeking around swap at that point; maybe shrink_cache
got stuck too much on wait_on_page; I'm only guessing.

I'm sure you did the right thing, copying it to a grown-up filesystem.
tmpfs is fine while everything is in memory, and even when a little
overflowed to swap; but with so much on swap it's at the mercy of the
vagaries of the LRU lists, and swap allocation might work out far
from optimal for it.  tmpfs use of swap is not something we've ever
tried to optimize for.
Perhaps something exceptionally stupid and avoidable occurs, I'll keep
your mail as reminder to investigate some day.  But if most of your
file is going to be on disk, much better to keep it in a filesystem
which allocates disk blocks to files in a well-designed way, than to
rely on tmpfs use of swap.

I'm assuming you ran it two or three times without rebooting or running
swapoff.  In which case, I doubt that the same parts of the file got the
same swap blocks each time (the association is not persistent), so I
don't think it would be a problem with your swap partition itself.
Sorry for tmpfs wasting your CDs: trust your reiserfs next time.
