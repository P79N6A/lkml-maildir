Andrew,
Thank you for the reply, I believe I've found the reason frame buffer doesn't
work on my system, there is a divide by zero occurring at line 157 of
nvGetClocks in ./drivers/video/nvidia/nv_hw.c.
(Note: The screwy output below is due to hacking drivers/serial/8250.c to add two
routines serial_putchar and serial_putchars so that I could make progress looking
for the bug, as printk stopped working at acquire_console_sem called from bind_con_driver.)
Last portion of the output:
@[   97.643286] take_over_console: call bind_con_driver csw=ffffffff805d8600 first=0, last=62, deflt=1
@[   97.652521] bind_con_driver: E
@[   97.655774] bind_con_driver: acquire_console_sem
@1[   97.660604] acquire_console_sem: drivers/char/vt.c:bind_con_driver:2752
@!2345689abABCDEF<fb_con_init>abcdefghij<nvidiafb_set_par>abcd<nvidia_calc_regs>bdjkl<NVCalcStateExt>acei<nv30UpdateArbitrationSettings>a<nv
GetClocks>N=83 NB=0 freq=27000 M=3 MB=0 P=0
From the above output we see MB=0 and hence death at line 157:
*MClk = ((N * NB * par->CrystalFreqKHz) / (M * MB)) >> P;
It would seem that my hardware (7600 GT K0) is not supported by the driver?
It should also be noted that there are quite a number of divisions
in the nv_hw.c that have no protection against divide by zeros.
