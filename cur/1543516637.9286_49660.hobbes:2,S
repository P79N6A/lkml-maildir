   This patch adds blank console keyboard combination. This is usefull if
   you want your monitor to consume less energy (primarily usefull on
   notebooks to extend batery life).
I gotta ask; are there really that many notebooks that don't have a
built-in way of doing this already?  (On the Vaio 505, it's Fn-D,
although it's one of the Fn- combinations that's not printed on the
keybaord.)    And you can do this via a user-mode command, right; so is
it really that important to put this into the kernel's keyboard driver?
