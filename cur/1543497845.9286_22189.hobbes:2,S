Shortly Ralf Nyren wrote about his problem with mounting the swap-device.
I tried this too and got somehow similar result. My kernel didn't crash,
but aproximatelly 15mins after I tried to mount my swap-device
hda7(03:07)(by the mount command I got the same output as Ralf + the
message that I have to specify the file-system type),it cluttered my
screen with this message repeatelly:
ll_rw_block: device 03:07: only 512-char blocks implemented (4096)
Every time, when my machine tried to swap something (out?in) about 10 of
this messages appeared and for one or two seconds the machine stopped
responding. I let this happen only for about 10mins, than I rebooted the
system. Maybe if it would have been running longer, maybe it would have
crashed too.
I use the 2.3.5 kerne with RH5.2
