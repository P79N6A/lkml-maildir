Yes. And hdparm is kind enough to print:
/dev/sda:
 setting standby to 60 (5 minutes)
Here's a bizarre sequence which I just noticed:
[extraneous blank lines removed for clarity]
>> hdparm -C /dev/sd[abcde]
/dev/sda:  drive state is:  standby
/dev/sdb:  drive state is:  standby
/dev/sdc:  drive state is:  standby
/dev/sdd:  drive state is:  standby
/dev/sde:  drive state is:  standby
>> hdparm -S 60 /dev/sda
/dev/sda: setting standby to 60 (5 minutes)
>> hdparm -C /dev/sd[abcde]
/dev/sda: drive state is:  active/idle
/dev/sdb: drive state is:  active/idle
/dev/sdc: drive state is:  standby
/dev/sdd: drive state is:  standby
/dev/sde: drive state is:  standby
Note that the -S 60 on /dev/sda affected
/dev/sdb too! This is repeatable.
I have these drives as RAID5 (software RAID).
I don't know if that has anything to do with the
failure of -S or not. Don't know if hdparm bypasses
the RAID or not.
