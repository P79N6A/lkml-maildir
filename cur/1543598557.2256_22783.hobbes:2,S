	I should have continued my sentence with "if it was issued at the instant
'select' made that decision." Using 'select' on blocking sockets is usually
an error. Nevertheless, select itself is defined to work the same on both
blocking and non-blocking sockets. In general, there is no way the operating
system can make guarantees about the future state of a socket.
