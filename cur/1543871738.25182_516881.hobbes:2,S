Drivers are unloaded by stopping the whole machine (exactly because module 
unload is otherwise so hard to handle), so that never happens unless you 
actively block. In other words, if you do something as simple as
	if (inode->i_private_data)
		sysfs_flush_buffer(buffer);
then there is no race with unloading (unless the driver itself does 
something stupid, of course - but the whole point of having a kernel 
buffer is so that it does *not* have to make user accesses etc).
But the one thing you should *not* do is to depend on a sleeping lock, 
because that breaks the whole model!
