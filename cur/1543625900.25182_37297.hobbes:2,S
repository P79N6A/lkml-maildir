I have a computer that on most web sites, ftp transfers or anything related to the network
will start a connection and atart transferring for about 2 seconds and then the connection
will die out.  This does not happen on all sites but with most.  When booted into windows it has
no problem. It is very strange.  Have tried many different kernels including 2.4.18 with no luck.
all info is attached below.  There seems to be no pattern also for this.  but it doesn't matter 
it is ssh, http, ftp...they have this problem......any clues.
