I ran the same test again against 2.6.15-rc, and got pretty much the same thing.  It starts nice
and fast (30+MB/s, but drops down to under 10MB/s with the system time pegging one CPU).
Here is the oprofile result:
CPU: P4 / Xeon with 2 hyper-threads, speed 2658.47 MHz (estimated)
Counted GLOBAL_POWER_EVENTS events (time during which processor is not stopped) with a unit mask
of 0x01 (mandatory) count 100000
