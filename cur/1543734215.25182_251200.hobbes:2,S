Hmm,
looks like probs I had recently on big filesystems under load on a smp 
machine. the only thing different is that I m using samba instead of 
nfs, but behaviour seems the same. On top of that we re encrypting the 
entire filesystems on this machine whicht now holds a total of 9 TB of 
attached storage.
In my observations those errors occure under the following conditions:
- using an smp system
- using applications which concurrently allocating memory in an 
aggressive manner
- freemem is at the lower limit given in vm.min_free_kbytes
Following numerous threats in mailinglists the has been some 
changes/patches for the most current kernels scoping these probs, 
however, if you are bound to a distribution kernel it may help to set 
the mentioned parameter
vm.min_free_kbytes
5 to 10 times bigger than given by default. At least for me it worked 
... no more oops, even under heavy load/backup etc.

Independently from this prob, can anyone confirm that there is a prob 
with concurrent allocating memory under load on linux smp systems?!
