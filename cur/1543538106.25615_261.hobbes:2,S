No, linking isn't good enough. Many of these are inline assembly.
Even when not, one would want to completely eliminate function calls.

Yes, exactly.

You aren't thinking like a distribution or hardware vendor.
Distributions use modules, even though compiled-in drivers are
more efficient. Until recently, distributions didn't do SMP.
Many distributions (still?) compile kernels for a real 80386.
Even if a hardware vendor ships source code, they may still want
to ship binary drivers for popular distributions. (and when they
don't also ship source, SMP users currently get left out)
Currently we have a nasty symbol-mangling system to prevent people
from loading SMP modules into a uniprocessor kernel. This wouldn't
be so important if every uniprocessor kernel could handle the code.
For tech support, it is nice to be able to tell someone to boot
with an option to enable lock checking or some sort of trace code.
This is easier than explaining, over the phone to someone clueless,
how to compile and/or install a new kernel.
