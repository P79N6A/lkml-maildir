This is not true at all. You can do it manually, even with NTFS. Go to
disk manager and select "check" over a NTFS volume. The system will say
something like  "Cannot check now..., do you want to run chkdsk after next
reboot?" If you say YES and reboot the machine, just take a chair and
cofee, it's going to take a loooooong time.
Disclaimer: chkdsk isn't normally started for NTFS after a crash, that's
true, but after few crashes I found a lot of error with (unconsistency in
file) chkdsk.
