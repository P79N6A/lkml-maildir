The file handle is zero, so you're getting 'Stale file handle' (-ESTALE
== -116) messages.
If the client thinks you have a stale inode (i.e. somebody on another
machine has deleted the file, and the file handle has been reused by
the server) it will set the file handle to zero and the above messages
may occur.
Please note that Linux-2.2.9 (well 2.2.8 is first actually) fixes a
few bugs w.r.t. whether an inode is considered to be stale or not.
Cheers,
