Thanks for the feedback. (:

This stuff is trivial enough, and easy enough to test, that I think it
could go in 2.4, yes.  Obviously xconfig would need to be dealt with
in sync with the others, which I'm not doing during the prototyping /
idea-mongering stage.

You give me too much credit.  The main motivation for dropping the '$'
was to make possible the "" == "n" semantics.  That the patch failed
to do so was accident, not design.
I know the current behavior is documented, but I had thought this was
because changing the behavior was not feasible due to our Bash-based
"JIT parsers".  Can you provide a rationale for why the current
behavior is desirable?  It seems to me that it only encourages buggy
Config.in code (since "" == "n" in other contexts like the #defines),
and I don't see any benefits other than that it's the status quo.
[Not to demean the status quo - in 2.4 it is probably appropriate.]

I wasn't sure what else to call it.  Besides, as explained above, it's
intended (rightly or wrongly) to be 3-state logic, where two states
represent a form of "true". (:
Perhaps "the /dep/ may have a prefix "!", which transforms the
/tristate/ as follows: ..."  This is particularly appropriate in light
of Roman's argument (which I buy) in favor of "!m" == "m".

I suppose one could add sanity checks / diagnostics, but there are no
other valid cases, so that's all they would be.  I'm not really trying
to produce a config.in 'lint' - leave that to the static parsers like
gcml2, xconfig and mconfig.
