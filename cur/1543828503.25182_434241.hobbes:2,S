Chris,
Resource Groups(CKRM) does allow threads to be in different Resource
Groups ( and since Resource Group assignment is dynamic, a thread can
move to a high priority resource group for a specific operation and get
back to its original resource group after the operation is complete).
Just wondering if that is sufficient or you _would_ need support from
NPTL.
