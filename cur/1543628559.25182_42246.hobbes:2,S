That would be the patch that is the diff between 2.2.19-pre1 and
2.2.19-pre2. If you already have a tree with 2.2.19-pre1, you could
apply this patch and get a tree which is 2.2.19-pre2.

That would be a patch between 2.2.19 and 2.2.19-pre2. If you had a
pristine tree with 2.2.19, you would apply this one and get a tree
with 2.2.19-pre2.

If you want to go 17->18-prex directly, use the specific patch in
'old'. If you want to go through each pre in order, use those in
'incr'.

Sounds so.
