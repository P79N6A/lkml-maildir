This device is a somewhat buggy PCI card which somebody sent me after
unsuccessful attempts to get it properly working under Linux.  Among
more serious trouble, ohci1394 reads a bogus maximum async payload (a
zero value) from the BusOptions register during startup.  This has
occasionally been reported for some VT6306 in the past.  I haven't
really tested this card myself yet, it's currently stuck in a PC which I
don't use anymore.
Bad VT6306 card:
PCI: Found IRQ 11 for device 0000:00:0a.3
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 0000:00:0a.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 11 with 0000:00:10.1
ohci1394: fw-host0: OHCI-1394 1.0 (PCI): IRQ=[11]
MMIO=[ec101000-ec1017ff]  Max Packet=[2]  IR/IT contexts=[4/8]
ohci1394: fw-host0: Serial EEPROM has suspicious values, attempting to
set max_packet_size to 512 bytes
ieee1394: Host added: ID:BUS[0-00:1023]  GUID[001106000000e332]
VT6306 onboard controller:
PCI: setting IRQ 5 as level-triggered
PCI: Found IRQ 5 for device 0000:00:0c.0
PCI: Sharing IRQ 5 with 0000:00:0a.2
ohci1394: fw-host1: OHCI-1394 1.0 (PCI): IRQ=[5]
MMIO=[ec103000-ec1037ff]  Max Packet=[2048]  IR/IT contexts=[8/8]
ieee1394: Host added: ID:BUS[1-00:1023]  GUID[00301bac00002ba4]
VT6306 CardBus card in my main PC:
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:06:00.0[A] -> GSI 17 (level, low) -> IRQ 18
ohci1394: fw-host2: OHCI-1394 1.0 (PCI): IRQ=[18]
MMIO=[80000000-800007ff]  Max Packet=[1024]  IR/IT contexts=[4/8]
ieee1394: Host added: ID:BUS[2-00:1023]  GUID[00110600000041cc]
The Max Packet value of the CardBus card is OK; all CardBus cards seem
to have this limitation regardless of their link layer chip.
I wonder what's up with the varying number of IR contexts.  The
datasheet talks about 8 IR contexts and 8 IR context registers, but also
has a sentence "These registers are Context Control registers for
isochronous Receive Contexts 0-3" which may be an editorial error.
