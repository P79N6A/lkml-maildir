Why should we make sure that PF_NOFREEZE tasks are also frozen for
cpu hotplug? Instead, we can create an infrastructure which allows threads to
specify for the scenarios they would want to be excempted from freeze.
Something like what Paul has suggested in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/31/323.
 That way, threads which have nothing
to do with the online_cpu_map or with handling of cpu-hotplug events can
mark themselves to be exempted from being frozen for cpu hotplug.
Once this is achieved, it's all about classifying the threads into
according to their NO_FREEZE needs :)

Just wondering, how hard is that ?
thanks
