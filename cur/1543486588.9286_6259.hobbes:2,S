Which one? There may be any number of them (including 0). Where do you
want it? In the kernel you may wade throught the cyclic list (anchored in
i_dentry and going through d_alias. If it's a userspace - think *hard*
whether you need it or not. You are wide-open to some interesting races
here. It's simply *not* a thing natural in UNIX way. You have to scan
all directories and do readdir() in each of them. From script use find(1)
(see manpage for details). Again, there is no such thing as *the*
directory entry of inode - there may be many and there may be none.
What do you need it for?
