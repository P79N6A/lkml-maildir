Linux 2.X trees are tested with memory sent from the buffer cache to the
disk I/O subsystem aligned on 512-byte boundries.   This error is
typically seen is someone is passing memory via calls to ll_rw_blk()
that are not at a minimum 512-byte aligned, which can result in a wrap
case that will hang the IDE DMA controller.  Linux I do not believe has
been tested with any other alignment.  When I first saw these errors
when I was writing my own LRU for the NWFS file system, alignment was
the cause.
