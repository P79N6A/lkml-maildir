2.5.75?  Why such an old kernel?
  Deepak> Kindly provide me appropriate guidance.. , where am I wrong?
For a zx6000, you're better off configuring it as ZX1 system, rather
than GENERIC.  The latter should also work, but will be (slightly)
less efficient (and the kernel will be needlessly bigger).

Yes, but you do need something newer than 2.5.75.  Try 2.6.0-test9.
  Deepak> Do I need additional patches the stock kernel + ia64 patch ?
No patch is needed.  There still is a patch, but if you don't care
about the last drop of performance and/or early printk-support, you
don't need it.
BTW: The daily build-status of Linus' kernel tree can be found here:
       
http://www.gelato.unsw.edu.au/kerncomp/
     You can also get know-to-be-good .config files from there.
Also, in the future you may want to use linux-ia64@vger.kernel.org for
such question, since that mailing list is focused on ia64.
