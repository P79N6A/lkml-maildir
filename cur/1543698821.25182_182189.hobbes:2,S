Hi Craig,
The numbers here are very impressive. Is there is an easy way
to make a table of results like this with STP? What is the
exact parameter line you pass to hackbench to get this?
These are results from a run with my scheduler patch on the
8-way. Not sure if they're comparable but if so they are a
small improvement.
