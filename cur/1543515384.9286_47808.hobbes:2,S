usb-scsi (USB mass storage driver) recognizes devices
like USB ZIP, USB floppy, and a few others.  I don't
know of anyone using a USB HDD (like LaCie) or USB CD-RW
drives with it yet.
I only have a USB floppy drive, which is currently always
reported as read-only (write-protected), but I can fix
that easily.
I have seem emails (on the linux-usb mailing list) about
some people successfully using USB ZIP drives.
USB is still in serious development, so _I_ wouldn't save
critical data only on a USB mass storage device just yet.
