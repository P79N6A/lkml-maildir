I am enterprising but do not know about trustworthy :)
I have RPM packages available here:
	
http://tech9.net/rml/procps
for the 2.0.9 tree and a CVS dump of a day or two ago as well as
tarballs of the source tree for 2.0.9 and CVS.
I try to keep the CVS dumps fairly up-to-date as we break stuff in
2.5-mm.  Rik and I have also added quite a bit of interesting new
features, so I would recommend everyone try out the new procps.
