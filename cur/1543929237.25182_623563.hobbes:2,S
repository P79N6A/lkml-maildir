that was wishful thinking 10 years ago already, when Linux was 10 times

to the contrary, being 120+ seconds uninterruptible without a very good 
reason is certainly something that was unreasonable (and harmful) for a 
long time already - we just never had the mechanism to warn about this 
intelligently without crashing the system.
Out of direct experience, 95% of the "too long delay" cases are plain 
old bugs. The rest we can (and must!) convert to TASK_KILLABLE or could 
annotate if it _really_ needs to be TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE.

There are no softlockup false positive bugs open at the moment. If you 
know about any, then please do not hesitate and report them, i'll be 
eager to fix them. The softlockup detector is turned on by default in 
Fedora (alongside lockdep in rawhide), and it helped us find countless 
number of bugs. You are the first person to suggest that it's somehow 
harmful.
