While reading through the FRV Documentation patch I stumbled across the file
"clock.txt" file which says:
+ (*) clock.txt
+
+     A description of the CPU clock scaling interface.
+
Could you use the generic cpufreq core (drivers/cpufreq/) for this, please?
And could you explain the difference between p0, cm and cmode settings to
me, and how they can be combined, please? Or is the following assumption 
correct?
The CPU core frequency can only be modified on FR405 CPUs, while p0 and cm 
are available on all CPUs and allow for modification of the frequency of 
some sort of external busses.
Thanks,
	Dominik
