Subject: X unlock bug revisited

Some months ago I noted that a new kernel introduced a failure to be able 
to unlock X after locking. Still there in 2.5.69 for RH 7.2, 7.3, and 8.0.
Is there any plan to address whatever causes this problem with a kernel 
fix, or is a 2.4 kernel still the way to go if you need to lock X. I 
realize many developers work in environments where there's no need.
