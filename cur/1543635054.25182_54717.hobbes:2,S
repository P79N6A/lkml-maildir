How about a 20 gig Seagate Barracuda ATA II Model ST320420A dying after 1.5 months, and the replacement disk - same model - after 5 months. The supplier blamed my IDE controller (old standard 
Intel Corp. 82371FB PIIX IDE [Triton I]: chipset revision 2) and refused to replace the second dud.
The 15 gig IBM-DTLA-307015 has worked flawlessly in the same system for a year. Have yet to try TCQ though. Waiting for a "stable" and modern 2.4
