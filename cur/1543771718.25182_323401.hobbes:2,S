O.K.  Yes, it seems that this is definitely not a popular idea.   :-)

Yes, this is a good idea...  I just might re-post this approach
as a suggestion.

Yes, but Andrew Morton suggested I try out the above test scenario on:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/testing/linux-2.6.12-rc5.tar.bz2
And the problem has indeed been fixed - there is some new code in the
i386 version of handle_signal() that fixes this problem.
(I saw the problem on earlier 2.6.11.10 and 2.6.11.11 kernels.)
Thanks for the feedback, Andrew.
