the bios doesn't have enough capability to talk to the outside world for 
updates.
what tivo actually does is very similar to this
they encode into the bios the ability to check a checksum/signature for 
the kernel+boot filesystem and if they don't match look to see if there is 
another kernel+boot filesystem available
then software on the boot filesystem checks to see if the rest of the 
system has been tampered with before it mounts /

the GPLv3 is trying to do this.
