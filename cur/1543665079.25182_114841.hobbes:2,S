Well I'd consider this a workaround for a rampant compiler bug.  It's just
weird that it refuses to inline a function like that.  Having to make 10,000
edits to the kernel tree to work around this does not appeal.
Cannot we just stick:
	#define inline	__inline__ __attribute__((always_inline))
in kernel.h?
