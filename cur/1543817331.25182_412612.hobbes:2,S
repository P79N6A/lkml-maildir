By the way, this is the same thing on x86: look at include/asm-i386/bitops.h:
#define smp_mb__before_clear_bit()      barrier()
#define smp_mb__after_clear_bit()       barrier()
A simple compiler barrier, nothing but
#define barrier() __asm__ __volatile__("": : :"memory")
See, no memory ordering there, because clear_bit already has a LOCK prefix.
