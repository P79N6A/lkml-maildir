Actually, it doesn't.  In fact it goes out of its way to say that "asm
volatile" statements can be moved quite a bit, with respect to other
asms, other code, jumps, basic blocks, etc.  The only reliable way to
control the placement of an asm is have the right dependencies.
    The `volatile' keyword indicates that the instruction has important
    side-effects.  GCC will not delete a volatile `asm' if it is reachable.
    (The instruction can still be deleted if GCC can prove that
    control-flow will never reach the location of the instruction.)  Note
    that even a volatile `asm' instruction can be moved relative to other
    code, including across jump instructions.
also:
    An `asm' instruction without any output operands will be treated
    identically to a volatile `asm' instruction.
So there isn't anything very special about "asm volatile".  It's purely
to stop apparently useless code from being removed.
