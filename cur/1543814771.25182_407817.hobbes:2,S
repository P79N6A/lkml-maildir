Oh no, that rule thumb isn't actually "don't put ifdefs in .c files", but
people commonly say it that way anyway. The rule is actually that you should
put ifdefs in declarations rather than call/usage sites.
You did the right thing there by introducing the accessor, which moves the
ifdef out of code that wants to query the member right? But you can still
leave it in the .c file if it is local (which it is).
