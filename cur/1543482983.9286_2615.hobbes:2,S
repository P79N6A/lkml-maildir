You should be aware that tthe granularity of ioremap is PAGE_SIZE, it
doesn't make any sense to map anything smaller than PAGE_SIZE. Whether
this is what bites you I cannot say, guess it isn't if it worked with
the old hardware in the same kernel version (don't think anything
changed in ioremap() on Intel recently).
