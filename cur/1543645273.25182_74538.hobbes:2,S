This is slower than the current DRI can do ;-)
dual Athlon MP 1900+ (but all XFree and Mesa stuff is single threaded 
currently):
Mesa/demos> ./gears
r200CreateScreen
6465 frames in  5.000 seconds = 1293.000 FPS
11955 frames in  5.000 seconds = 2391.000 FPS
11954 frames in  5.000 seconds = 2390.800 FPS
11955 frames in  5.000 seconds = 2391.000 FPS
11954 frames in  5.000 seconds = 2390.800 FPS
I wonder why nobody point to the place were "the real development" is?
dri.sourceforge.net
or the new test site (under construktion)
http://lfm.sourceforge.net/dritest/
Xv is supported with the current trunk, too.
If you need the video capabilities take a look at the GATOS page.
