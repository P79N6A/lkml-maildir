I think the "crap" refers to current missing meatures of linuxthreads
(most notable: PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED on cond and mutex, don't know about sema)
BTW, NGPT introduces two new syscalls: gettid and tkill

also remember pthread_cond_broadcast - waking up _all_ waiting threads.
If the woken up threads check their condition and go to sleep again, is
up to them ( read: the standard mandates that _all_ get woken up)
pthread_cond_signal notifies _one_ thread - which one depends on implementation
( I would like to see a priority based decision )
