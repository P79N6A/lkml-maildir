That, btw, includes "automatic merges" for something like a Linux-next 
tree. It's easy to just make something that says: if the merge fails, try 
to fix up these xyz files by just committing them with merge error markers 
and all".
That's fine for testing, exactly because it has no coding impact (and then 
when a _real_ merge happens, you have a human that actually resolves it).
The git script would be something like
	UNIMPORTANT_LIST=MAINTAINERS \
		Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt \
		...
	git pull ... ||
		git add $UNIMPORTANT_LIST &&
		git commit -m "Trivially conflicting merge"
which basically says: if the pull fails (leaving a conflicted tree), try 
to just "git add" the files on the unimportant list as-is, and then try to 
commit the merge that way instead.
Git if nothing if not scriptable, and things like this are *trivial*.
