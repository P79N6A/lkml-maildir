It's a useful entry, but I don't think it really belongs in the
linux-kernel mailing list FAQ. It belongs in some other
hardware-related document. Better to search for an appropriate one,
and get that updated as needed. I'm happy to add a link to it, though.
I just don't want the LKML FAQ turning into a bloated monster that
tries to answer all questions. The WWW is a *web*, not a central
repository, and works best if we keep it a web. Links Are Good[tm].
While I'm flattered you consider me (or at least the LKML FAQ) the
fount of all knowledge, I really would feel better if others shared in
the burden^Wglory.
