If the problem doesn't occur before 2.6.16, that makes a hardware 
problem less likely. It's not impossible that some buggy feature is now 
used, but lower probability than the kernel change being the culprit. 
The bug fix you mention may solve the whole thing, or make it easier to 
debug.
General comment: if a kernel version made my system crash once a day I 
sure wouldn't be using it. New features are neat, but I wouldn't put up 
with that if it made my cat pee holy water.
I would test proposed fixes, of course, but only until I got more info 
for developers.

   Obscure bug of 2004: BASH BUFFER OVERFLOW - if bash is being run by a
normal user and is setuid root, with the "vi" line edit mode selected,
and the character set is "big5," an off-by-one errors occurs during
wildcard (glob) expansion.
