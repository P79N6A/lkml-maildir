Yes, thanks.
tick_nsec doesn't require special treatment, in the middle term it's obsolete 
anyway, it could be replaced with (current_tick_length() >> 
TICK_LENGTH_SHIFT) and current_tick_length() being inlined.
NTP_INTERVAL_FREQ could be a real variable (so it can be initialized at 
runtime), it's already gone from all important paths.
In the short term I'd prefered a clock would store its frequency instead of 
using NTP_INTERVAL_LENGTH in clocksource_calculate_interval(), so it doesn't 
has to be derived there.
bye, Roman
