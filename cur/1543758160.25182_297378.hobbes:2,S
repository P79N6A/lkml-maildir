Hi,
I have an external IDE connector through USB port. Where could I get
the exact point inside the kernel, from where I would get information
such as Block No., Request size, partition details for a particular
request, _just_ before being sent to the disk.
Like, for a normal IDE, I could gather these details from inside the
function __ide_do_rw_disk from "struct request". Is there anyway for
finding out the same for a USB mass storage device?
Thanks.
