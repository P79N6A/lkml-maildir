That's good to hear.  BTW, do you mean UP machine? or do you have a
Uni-Multi-Processor machine :)

Also, thanks a lot for the comment about 2.6.15-rt18.  If it ain't
broken, don't fix it.  There's no reason for you to upgrade if what you
have works.  If you just like to test our stuff, then that's great and
we really do appreciate it.
I've been working on embedded devices too much and haven't tested my
x86_64 machine in a while either, I think the last I booted was in the
2.6.15-rt16 (that's the oldest in my /boot directory).  Heck, I was
still running 2.6.15 plain.
I happened to wipe out the flash drive on my embedded device and had to
wait for the recovery CD iso to be sent to me (Germany happens to have
some sort of Holiday, so no one was in the office).  So I remembered
that people where having problems with x86_64 and -rt, so I spent the
day finding out why.  It wasn't much of a patch, but boy was it hard to
find.
Thanks,
-- Steve
