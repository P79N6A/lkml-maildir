This may be the same as a problem that just came
up on the alsa mailing list.  I threw that email away,
but if I remember right there was a problem due to
a change in the proc interface around kernel 2.4.15.
The CVS version of alsa contains a fix.
Duncan.
PS: Try searching the alsa mailing list archive - better
than relying on my vague memories!
PPS: It came up very recently (yesterday?).
