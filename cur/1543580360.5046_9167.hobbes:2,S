This is the kind of problem I have been experiancing.
It either hangs on boot, or in a compile...
However I am using an NCR 810 and a scsi disk..
My board is the Compaq PC164 {some nasty partnumber}
The Servers all have the Qlogic ISP controller for the main disk.
both setups have only the boot disk on the boot controller, no other
devices....

The "socratic approach" is what you call starting an argument by
asking questions.
The human race will begin solving it's problems on the day that it
