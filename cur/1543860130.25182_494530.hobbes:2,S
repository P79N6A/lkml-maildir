I'll send that stuff along; providing the platform data is actually
an update to ACPI glue, not the driver, so the driver won't need to
become needlessly coupled to ACPI.  (Driver = rtc_cmos, I'll resend
it in a few days.)

Hmm, then maybe it'd be worth updating that patch I just sent so that
the only change is to switch #includes for the extern decl ... i.e. to
"export" it only to other statically linked kernel code, rather than to
modules.  I'll do that.
My own question about that EXPORT_SYMBOL was whether it instead be
an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, but if either one costs bytes ... I'm happy to
avoid that cost!
