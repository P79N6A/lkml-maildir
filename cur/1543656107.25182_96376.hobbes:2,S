A nice example.
Lets ditch --overlay and replace it with:
--transparent
	just like --overlay
--read-transparent
	a bit like a pane of glass. You can see stuff behind it (read) but 
throw a tomato at it and it sticks to the glass (write)
Then, simplifying your example a bit, we can mount the source cd then 
mount a directory --read-transparent over the top to hold both our 
patched source and compiled binaries.
Or if you want to keep patched-source and binaries seperate,
mount /cdrom stuff
mount --bind --read-transparent patched-src stuff
cd stuff
patch the src
mount --bind --read-transparent binaries stuff
compile your code

Yes - exactly

No. Thats not necessary.
