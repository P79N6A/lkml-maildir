The difference is that the preemptive kernel mostly uses existing 
infrastructure. When SMP scalability gets better due to holding locks
for a shorter time then the preemptive kernel will improve as well!
AND it can be used on a UP computer to "simulate" SMP and that
should help the quality of the total code base...
This is my idea:
* Add the preemptive kernel
* "Remove" reschedule points from main kernel.
   note: that reschedule points that does nothing more than
   test and schedule can be NOOPed since they will never trigger in a
   preemptive kernel...

Worst case latency... is VERY hard to prove if you rely on schedule points.
Since they are typically added after the fact...
If the code suddenly end up on a road less travelled...
With preemptive kernel your worst latency is the longest held spinlock. 
PERIOD.
(you can of cause be delayed by an even higher priority process)
* Make sure that there are no "infinite" loops inside any spinlock.
"infinite" == over ALL or ALL/x of something since someone, somewere
 will have ALL close to infinite... (infinity/x is still infinity... :-)
   example code is looping through LRU list to find a victim page...
   once it was not infinite due to the small number of pages...
Note: that akpm patches usually hava a - "do not do this list" with known
problem spots (ok, usually in a hard to break spinlocks).
