another poster said that NTP packets include information about this 
month's leap second, so that implies that they could change monthly.
the zoneinfo files normally do not change every year, they only change 
when !$#@$# polititions decide to monkey with things and change the rules 
(for the US this is once in the history of Linus IIRC), the aggregate of 
some country somewhere changing the rules means that more updates are 
created, but most people can ignore those updates if they don't directly 
apply to them.
