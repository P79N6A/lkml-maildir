That wont show working tree corruption.
Safest is to move away the working tree into a backup directory and check 
out the tree again:
  cd linux
  mkdir ../linux-backup
  mv * ../linux-backup
  git checkout HEAD .
then, if this solves the build problem, do some forensics by looking at:
 diff -rNu ../linux-backup ../linux'
