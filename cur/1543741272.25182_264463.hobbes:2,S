Just wanted to say that your patch fixes a similar slideshow problem I was
having with RTCW - same symptoms, apparently same solution. Applying your
patch kept kswapd from using 90-100% cpu in top whenever I was running the
game on my 512MB ram system running stock 2.6.9.
Thanks a bunch,
Tim McGrath
