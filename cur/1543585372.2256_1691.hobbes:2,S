AFAICR there is only an option for setting the I/O port. I'll check
for anything else later (the machine in question is busy right now :).

Yes.

irq=none seems pretty unequivocal to me, I'm not sure how easy it is to
explain to a user that irq=none doesn't do what it says.

I'm getting all sorts of troubles with a SB PCI 128 card (AC97 also).
If it works at all, it seems to eventually stop getting interrupts until
the module is removed and reloaded.
Which is why I suspect there may be a larger problem with the VIA
motherboards.
