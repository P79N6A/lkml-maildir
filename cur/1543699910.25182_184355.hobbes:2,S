Sounds right.
One thing to be cautious of here is an interaction with the "human factor".
 One tends to adjust the test case so that it takes a reasonable amount of
time.  So the process is:
Run 1: took five seconds.
       "hmm, it didn't swap at all.  I'll use some more threads"
Run 2: takes 4 hours.
       "man, that sucked.  I'll use a few less threads"
Run 3: takes ten minutes.
       "ah, that's nice.  I'll use that many threads from now on".
Problem is, you have now carefully placed your test point right on the
point of a sharp knee in a big curve.  So small changes in input conditions
cause large changes in runtime.   At least, that's what I do ;)

It would be nice, but I've yet to find a workload in which 2.6 pageout
decisively wins.
It could well be that something is simply misbehaving in there and that we
can pull back significant benefits with some inspired tweaking rather than
with radical changes.  Certainly some of Roger's measurements indicate that
this is the case, although I worry that he may have tuned himself onto the
knee of the curve.
