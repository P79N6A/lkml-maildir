That you pushed MAX_NR_REQUESTS is a really bad idea in my oppinion.
What is the point of having 4MB worth of seeks in the queue? Know you
can fit exactly 1024 seeks in there, with a average seek time of 10 ms
that's over 10 seconds of waiting. That logic is at least as warped as
having 128 64KiB streamed writes in the queue (the problem we had
before), if that is a streamed write it will only take a fraction of the
time the seeky work load will. Even with one seek in between each write,
it's still better...

On that we agree. I just think you took it to the other extreme know,
we'll see seek storms penalizing work loads now instead of write bombs.
So yes it did solve the write bomb, but introduced another problem.
Write bomb problem is easier hit of course, but hey you cannot leave the
other one open can you? That'd be like allowing reads to pin down all
memory :)

Correct. Speaking of low mem, using 4 times as many requests on a queue
isn't exactly peaches for low mem consumption on big disk machines
either.

I bench on a 2-way.

You only had to look a the numbers posted to see that that was the case.

Completely agree, and I'll proceed to make such a patch today. I hope we
can agree not to waste more time discussion the merrit (that is clear,
it's a win) and applicability of the patch I posted. I showed numbers,
and that was it.
