   A fix that seems to work for me on parisc64 is to move the atomic_t out
   of the end of struct sock_common and back into the two other structures
   (so struct sock_common now ends on 0 mod 8).
I would suggest instead to add the proper alignment attribute
to the appropriate members of the tw bucket.
