Oh, the inode of a file which is open does remain in core.  It's just
that between runs of a program like "make", the file's aren't open are
they?

That's some of the overhead.  The other overhead is reading the clock,
which is quite high on x86 when TSC is not available.  On a Pentium
with no reliable TSC, I think that the time for a read() system call
is comparable to the time to read the clock.
