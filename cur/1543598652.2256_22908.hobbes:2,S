Running 2.4.8-ac7 using the alternate uhci driver both my USB keyboard
and mouse work fine.  I can't use the regular uhci driver because it
aparently has SMP issues with keyboards and like to hard lock the entire
system, no oops or anything, if any LED key
(numlock,capslock,scrolllock) is pressed enough times to turn an LED on
and then off.  Using 2.4.8-ac8 with the patch from below at least works
more than stock 2.4.8-ac8 but I still get failures: specifically the
regular uhci driver seems to work perfectly except for the issue noted
above.  But my uchi controller using the alternate uhci driver on
2.4.8-ac8 results in an unusable system, and with the patch below kind
of works.  By kind of I mean that it doesn't oops and there aren't any
of the couldn't assign id type messages but I get a ton of the "raced
timeout" messages and the mouse and keyboard only sporadically work, the
really weird thing is that while they sporadically work for X and the
console, SysRq keys on the USB keyboard seem to be perfectly
functional.  I don't feel that I need both drivers to work all the time,
but it would be nice to either get the regular uhci driver stable with
my keyboard and SMP motherboard, or get a functional alternate uchi in
-ac again.  Hope that helps in at least some small way to figure out
what happend.
