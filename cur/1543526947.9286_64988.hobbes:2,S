Hello!
I have 2.2.12 kernel RedHat6.1 and SMC9334BDT fast ethernet dual-channel
PCI network card, it combines the functionality of two separate cards. My
linux see it as eth0 and eth1. I wont, that my computer communicate
with double bandwidth. I don't now, what is required to that: kernel
configuration, extra driver or package, etc. 2 card must have 1 IP
nummer, linux must 2 card as 1 ethernecard handeln?
Please help me.
