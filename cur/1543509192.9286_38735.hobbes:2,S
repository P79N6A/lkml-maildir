Subject: More Amiga RDSK partition woes

After discovering that 2.2.x and Amiga partitions do not happily co-exist.
And
after learning that AFFS in 2.3.6+ (IIRC) is broken due to a page cache
rewrite. I decided to give 2.0.38 a try...
Only to find that since my Amiga HD has been in a win9x machine, since being
removed from my trusty A1200, that the RDB has been trashed.
Summary of catch22 type problems:
2.2.x - Amiga partitions cause the kernel to freeze on boot
2.3.6+ - Partitions recognised (and RDB trashed word worked around) but
            AFFS broken due to page cache rewrite
2.0.38 - Partition not recognisd because of trashed word in RDB
Does anyone know which of the 2.3 kernels I may have luck with? I just want
to copy some files off the disk to use with UAE (my Amiga is now dead alas).
Who is maintaining AFFS in 2.3?  Will it be fixed before 2.4? (pretty
please)
Benny
