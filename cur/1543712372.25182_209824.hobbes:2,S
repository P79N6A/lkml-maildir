With the patches that I have just sent, plus adding #include
<linux/types.h> to include/linux/prefetch.h, since it uses size_t, -mm4
compiles and runs on my powerbook (ppc32).  It does, however, freeze
up shortly after waking up from sleep (suspend-to-ram).  I don't know
why.
On ppc64 I got a compile error in arch/ppc64/kernel/eeh.c, because the
-mm4 patch removes a #include <asm/machdep.h> that is needed.  When I
put that back in, it compiles and runs on my G5.  That is with the
include/linux/prefetch.h change and the ppc signal patch that I posted.
Paul.
