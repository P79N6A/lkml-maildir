I'm glad to see this patch no longer trashes previous chip state,
but there's still an issue in that area.  Surely the code should
	ret = pca9539_read_reg(...)
	if (ret)
		goto out_failed;
and likewise for the write?  If the chip isn't present (and thus
an I/O error is reported), its probe() should fail.
