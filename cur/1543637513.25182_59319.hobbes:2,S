Well, I put it since many ide chipset drivers put it, but we may indeed
get rid of it, provided the board isn't upset when parallel selectprocing
/ tuning on ide0 and ide1. I won't be able to test before September.
Oh, btw, I only use one spinlock for timing computing, while there could
be one per QD channel, which would speed up tunig :o)
