In my experience, scheduling things for removal at a far away date has 
nearly no effect - people still don't start complaining until it's being 
made clear that the code will really be removed, and that it will be 
removed soon.
It wouldn't be the first time that after a longer deprecation periodthe 
first person is complaining not before I'm sending the patch to remove 
the deprecated code.
In this case, we are talking about the OSS drivers with ALSA drivers for 
the same hardware. And a driver will not be removed if one person 
notifies me about one regression in the ALSA driver compared to the OSS 
driver.
And the positive effect of forcing people to report the regressions in 
ALSA drivers is already visible as improvements in the ALSA drivers.
