     I installed a newer make swap, made a larger partition, did a mkswap on
it (which didn't complain), then attempted a swapon /dev/sdb1 (the partition
in question) and got the following:
/sbin/swapon /dev/sdb1
swapon: /dev/sdb1: Invalid argument
     So I traced the program to see what it was bitching about:
stat("/dev/sdb1", {st_mode=S_IFBLK|0600, st_rdev=makedev(8, 17), ...}) = 0
swapon("/dev/sdb1")                     = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
     The swapon call returns EINVAL; according to the man page for the swapon
system call:
       EINVAL  is returned if path exists, but is neither a regu-
               lar path nor a block device.
     However this IS a block device:
# file /dev/sdb1
/dev/sdb1: block special (8/17)
     I installed the disk-utils from the new linux-utils package as well as
the new swapon.  But I've tried with the old swapon and get the same thing;
I've tried v0 and v1 swap and get the same thing.  I don't know what I've done
but I don't think it's good!
