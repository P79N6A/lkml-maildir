I get a kernel oops every few days (even weeks if I'm lucky) with kernel
2.4.2 that I suspect are related to my Speedtouch USB ADSL modem.  The box
in question is monitor and keyboardless unless strictly necessary, and
routes the ADSL internet connection to a local network.
What is the preferred what of getting debugging information from a kernel
oops?  Is my only way connecting a monitor and getting a pencil and paper? 
Is there any conceivable way I can get some useful debugging information
(on reset) without plugging in a keyboard/monitor?
