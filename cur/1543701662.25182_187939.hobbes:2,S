Rusty, I took a better look at the patch and I think we can have 
per-kthread stuff w/out littering the task_struct and by making the thing 
more robust. We keep a global list_head protected by a global spinlock. We 
define a structure that contain all the per-kthread stuff we need 
(including a task_struct* to the kthread itself). When a kthread starts it 
will add itself to the list, and when it will die it will remove itself 
from the list. The start/stop functions will lookup the list (or hash, 
depending on how much stuff you want to drop in) with the target 
task_struct*, and if the lookup fails, it means the task already quit 
(another task already did kthread_stop() ??, natural death ????). This is 
too bad, but at least there won't be deadlock (or crash) beacause of this. 
This because currently we keep the kthread task_struct* lingering around 
w/out a method that willl inform us if the task goes away for some reason 
(so that we can avoid signaling it and waiting for some interaction). The 
list/hash will be able to tell us this. What do you think?
