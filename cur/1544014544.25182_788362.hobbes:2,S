The tracing_on is implemented by the ring buffer, and disables all ring 
buffers, even those that are not part of ftrace. This file really has no 
concept of a tracer. It simply stops writing to the ring buffer.
Things like the irq latency tracer is will still update its "max time" 
when tracing is off, although the trace output will not be updated.
I could remove tracing_enabled, and move the tracing_on to trace.c,
that just calls the tracing_off of the ring buffer, and then the file will 
be at the higher layer, and have a concept of the current tracer.
