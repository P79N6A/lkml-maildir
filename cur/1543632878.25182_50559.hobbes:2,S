The kernel doesn't currently do spin-down at all, does it?  Andrew,
are you planning to change this?  I'm not a kernel programmer, but
it seems like a good idea to me:  The kernel could flush writes as
usual while the disk is spun up, but still spin down after a bit if
the rate is low enough.  The disk would never spin itself down in
that case.  Maybe there are also cases where the kernel would delay
spin-down, if it hasn't started writing but thinks it might soon.
I'm excited to try this.  Thanks for writing it against 2.4!
Andrew
