See the comment I added in 2.3.47/include/linux/fs.h:
/*
 * NOTE: write_inode, delete_inode, clear_inode, put_inode can be called
 * without the big kernel lock held in all filesystems.
 */
Note that the above comments is only related to the super operations and
that fsync, read, write, prepare_read,prepare_write, writepage, readpage
was just used to be all called without the big kernel lock held and ext2
was just getting them right.
