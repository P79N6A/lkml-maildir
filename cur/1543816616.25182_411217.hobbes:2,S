This is why I proposed also:

The architecture dependent "release_N_clear_bit()" should include what
is necessary for the correct unlocking semantics (and it leaves the freedom
for the "stand alone" bit operations implementations).
Note that "lock_buffer()" works on ia64 "by chance", because all the
atomic bit operations are implemented "by chance" by use of the "acq"
semantics.
I'd like to split the bit operations according to their purposes:
- e.g. "test_and_set_bit_N_acquire()" for lock acquisition
- "test_and_set_bit()", "clear_bit()" as they are today
- "release_N_clear_bit()"...
Thaks,
