Well darn, that patch fixed the wrong bit and we still have float in there.
allmodconfig doesn't pick this up.
drivers/built-in.o: In function `sisfb_do_set_var':
//drivers/video/sis/sis_main.c:654: undefined reference to `__floatsidf'

Search for "1E12" in sis_main.c
Here's the patch which adds -msoft-float to the kernel build, which picks
