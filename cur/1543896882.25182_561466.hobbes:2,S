Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Add group awareness to CFS - v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Ingo,
	Here's an update for the group-aware CFS scheduler that I have been
working on.
(For those reading these patches for the first time:)
The basic idea is to reuse CFS core and other pieces of scheduler like
smpnice-driven load balance for driving fairness between 'schedulable entities'
other than tasks, for ex: users or containers.
The time-sorted rb-tree and nanosecond accurate accounting aspects of
CFS are "repeated" for schedulable entities other than tasks. 
For ex: there could be N task-level rb-trees for N users (which stores
tasks) and a single user-level rb-tree which stores user-level entities.
CFS operations on each user's task-level rb-tree drives fairness between tasks
of that user, while CFS operations on user-level rb-tree drives
fairness between users.
v17 CFS introduced basic changes in CFS to support group scheduling.
The two patches to follow build upon them as follows:
Patch 1	=> introduces a notion of scheduler hierarchy (of entities) and
	   applies CFS operations at all levels of this hierarchy.
Patch 2 => hooks up the cpu scheduler with task grouping feature in mm tree
	   (CONFIG_CONTAINERS) as an interface to task-grouping functionality.
A single config option CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED allows the group-scheduling
feature to be turned on/off at compile time.
I have tried my best to ensure there is no impact to existing CFS performance
when CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED is disabled. Some results in this regard are 
provided at the end.
One noticeable change in functionality may be the /proc/sched_debug output
(I had to rearrange that code a bit to dump group cfs_rq information also).
Changes since last version:
	- Fixed some bugs in SMP load balance (pointed by Dmitry)
	- Modified sched_debug.c to dump all cfs_rq stats
Todo:
	- Weighted fair-share
		Currently all groups get "equal" cpu bandwidth. I plan
		to support weighted fair-sharing on the lines of task
		niceness.
	- Separate out tunable
		Right now tunable are same for all layers of scheduling.
		I strongly think we will need to separate them, esp
                sysctl_sched_runtime_limit.
        - Optimization
		- reduce frequency of timer tick processing at higher levels
        	- during load balance, pick cache-cold tasks first to migrate
	- hierarchy flattening
		Experiment with this (to reduce number of hierarchical levels)
		as per 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/26/81
Some results follows. Legends used in them are:
cfs        = base cfs performance (sched-cfs-v2.6.22-rc4-mm2-v18.patch)
cfsgrpdi   = base cfs + patches 1-2 applied (CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED disabled)
cfsgrpdi   = base cfs + patches 1-2 applied (CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED enabled)
All tests run on a 4-cpu Intel Xeon (x86_64) box:
A. Overhead Test
lat_ctx (from lmbench)

Context switching - times in microseconds - smaller is better

hackbench -pipe 100
===================
Average of 10 runs was taken. Smaller numbers are better.
cfs		4.0171
cfsgrpdi	4.154
cfsgrpen	4.7749
B. UP Group fairness test
	These tests were forced to run on a single CPU by making using
	of exclusive cpusets.
hackbench
=========
	
The two user's shell were put in different groups (as explained in Patch 2/2).
Each user then ran this script:
i=0
while [ $i -lt 10 ]
do
./hackbench -pipe 100 >> log
i=`expr $i + 1`
done
Time taken to complete this script was measured as follows (note that
both the scripts were made to run simultaneously on /same/ cpu).
vatsa		103.51 s (real)
guest		103.37 s (real)
Inference: Both users completed the same amount of work in (nearly) same time.
kernel compilation
==================
Again the two user's shell were put in different groups.
User vatsa ran "make -s -j4 bzImage", while
User guest ran "make -s -j20 bzImage"
Both are compiling the same sources (and hence should effectively be
doing the same amount of work). Time taken to complete kernel-compile by
both users:
vatsa	777.46 s (real)
guest 	778.30 s (real)
Inference: Both users completed the same amount of work in nearly same
time, even though one had higher number of threads dedicated to the job.
C. SMP Fairness test
====================
I used a simple cpu-intensive program which measures how much CPU time it got 
(using getrusage) over a minute. N (=4*NUM_CPUS) such tasks were spawned with 
N/2 in one group and N/2 in another group. Total CPU time obtained by one group 
was compared with total cpu time obtained by another group. While the test
was running, I observed distribution of all tasks across CPUs. I am
quite happy with the results obtained and with the load distribution. I
can share the sources/results of the program/script upon request.
Looking forward to your feedback on these patches!
[P.S : Since I am travelling this weekend, I may not respond promptly ]
