I think you're not clear on what PCMCIA support is in the 2.4 kernel
tree.  The pcnet_cs driver has been in the kernel tree as long as
anything else.  Most PCMCIA drivers are already in the kernel tree;
the ones that are not are: the memory card drivers (rarely used now),
parport_cs, and wvlan_cs.  The hot plug PCI drivers (3c59x, tulip,
epic100) subsume the 3c575_cb, tulip_cb, and epic_cb drivers
completely.

I don't like this idea one bit; multiple sets of config files for
different kernel versions is not workable.  People want to be able to
boot different kernel releases.  I want a way for cardmgr to figure
out on the fly, based on some feedback from the PCMCIA modules, what
the right thing to do is.

/etc/pcmcia/config should never be tweaked for anything.  That's what
the config.opts file is for.

Getting "ifup eth0" to run when you insert a CardBus card in the new
2.4 scheme is going to be an issue with the /sbin/hotplug script, and
out of the PCMCIA subsystem's control.
