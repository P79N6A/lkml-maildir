Subject: [2.6.14-rc4] ipw2200 still filling up dmesg

I'm aware that this problem has been reported before, but I was hoping
this would get fixed before 2.6.14 is released. The bug in bugzilla
also has been ignored so far [1].
I can't see a single thing in dmesg besides
eth1 (WE) : Driver using old /proc/net/wireless support, please fix
driver !
This is really annoying, any hope for this getting fixed?
Please CC me, thanks.
