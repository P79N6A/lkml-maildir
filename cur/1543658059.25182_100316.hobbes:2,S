Regarding the EFLAGS handling: why can't you just do 
a pushfl in the vsyscall page before pushing the 6th arg on the stack
and a popfl afterwards. 
Then the syscall entry in kernel code could just do
        pushfl $fixed_eflags
        popfl 
The first popl for the 6th arg in the vsyscall page wouldn't be traced 
then, but I doubt that is a problem.
Would add a few cycles to the entry path, but then it is better than
having slow context switch.
This would also eliminate the random IOPL problem Luca noticed.
BTW I think I have the same issue on x86-64 with SYSCALL (random IOPL
in kernel), but so far nothing broke, so it is probably not a big
problem.

Here are the numbers from a Dual 2.4Ghz Xeon. The first is plain 
2.5.54, the second is with the WRMSR-in-switch-to patch backed out.
Also 2.4.18-aa for co

If that is true the slowdown would be nearly 50% for the 2p case.
That looks a bit much, I wonder if lmbench is very accurate here
(do we have some other context switch benchmark to double check?)
but all numbers show a significant slowdown.
