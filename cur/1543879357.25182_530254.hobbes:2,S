Pulled the usb mouse - this moved the crash around.
usbhid was registered anyway, but later than usual.
The last messages:
md:  <...>
cpuidle: <...>
sdhci: <...>
sdhci: <...>
usbcore: registered new interface hiddev
usbcore: registered new interface usbhid
drivers/hid/usbhid/hid_core.c v2.6 USB HID coredriver
Advanced linux sound architecture <...>
ACPI: PCI Interrupt 0000:00:06.0[A]->GSI 17 (lewel,low)->IRQ 17
And then it hung. Rebooting into rc5mm4, I got this as the next msgs:
gameport: Trident 4DWave is pci0000:00:06.0/gameport0, speed 1966kHz
ALSA device list:
  #0: Trident TRID4DWAVENX PCI Audio at 0x9400, irq 17
oprofile: using NMI interrupt.
Netfilter messages via NETLINK v0.30.
I don't know if this is another problem, or what.

Just downloaded it. Unfortunately, it will not revert cleanly:
