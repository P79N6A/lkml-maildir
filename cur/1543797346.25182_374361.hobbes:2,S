Saw that too.

For Altix 20 means that the other node is remote but in the same 
enclosure / motherboard. Latency is very low in these cases. I think in 
these small configurations it is better to go off node rather than using 
the reclaim logic.
Other small configurations may have the same issues.
RECLAIM_DISTANCE can be set per arch if the default is not okay.
