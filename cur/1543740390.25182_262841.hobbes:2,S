Since the skeleton driver includes a define for that, I suspect your
assumption is a bit overly optimistic.

Not really. I have absolutely no problem with a MODULE_VERSION macro
*IF* the version it advertises means something. However if the version
it advertises has no meaning whatsoever (eg the version number never
gets updated) then imo it's better to NOT advertise anything so that
other tools (like dkms) don't make assumptions and decisions based on
nothing-meaning data.
