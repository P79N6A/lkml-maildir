Is this easily reproducible for you?  I've not seen it before, and
the only possibly related recent changes I can think of are these:
http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=e63a3690013a475746ad2cea998ebb534d825704
http://git.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=d210a28cd851082cec9b282443f8cc0e6fc09830
Could you try reverting each of those to see if either is the cause?
thanks.
