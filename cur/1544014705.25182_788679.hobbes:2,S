On a new ARM9 board with memory mapped interface to a compact flash 
socket, I need to implement an IDE or ATA driver that will support TRUE 
IDE mode.
Am using kernel version 2.6.26
What is the best starting point, i.e. example driver in the tree?
Please respond to my personal email address also as I do not subscribe.
