Subject: [PATCH] Signal hadnling fix for 2.4
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Marcelo,
While investigating a bug report about a 64bit application that crashed in
malloc, Paul Mackerras noticed that sys_rt_sigreturn's return value was
"int".  It needs to be "long" or else the return value of a syscall that
is interrupted by a signal will be truncated to 32 bits and then sign
extended.  This causes .e.g mmap's return value to be corrupted if it is
returning an address above 2^31 (which is what caused a SEGV in malloc).
This problem obviously only affects 64 bit processes.

Please apply for 2.4.33, this patch is against 2.4.33-pre2.
