(The humor in this e-mail may be caustic, but it's **really** not
intended to start a flamewar. Feel free to mentally insert one or two
smileys at the end of each paragraph. If the jokes don't make sense,
maybe they'll make more sense after you finish reading the entire
message.
Maybe these jokes are cruel, but honestly, the irony here just
absolutely *kills* me and I can't help myself right now.)

Food for thought: If upstream doesn't charge ahead, somebody else will.
And that will also cause regressions, albeit ones that are even harder
to see. People will think they're looking in the right direction, but
will be unable to see anything, and that will just confuse everyone
more.
(If that doesn't make sense now, read this message all the way
through, then start reading it from the beginning again.)

Until now. (Keep reading.)

I will not make vendor feature patches an issue in this thread. I'm not
going to exploit for argumentative purposes your odd definition of the
word "backport".

"Backport"? There you go again!

Or which patches to avoid "backporting", as the case may be.

And one of them (that I noticed, anyway) was a "backport" that you
(whether accidentally or intentionally) stopped "backporting" when you
rebased to 2.6.10.
If the "backport" jokes don't make sense yet, consider this dilemma: If
a backported patch has not been committed upstream yet, then is it
really a backport?
The following patch removes the ACPI shutdown bug from 2.6.9-1.724_FC3,
at least in my testing on my affected system. The diff almost succeeds
in speaking for itself, but to fully understand what it's saying, you
will also need to grep a 2.6.10 Fedora kernel-2.6.spec file for "kexec".
