This is a bit like what we (JE, David Brownell, and I) saw at
the USB plugfest in 1999.  We had a camera device that we
couldn't mount as a filesystem, but we could dd it.
When we did that and studied the dd-ed file, we could see a
FAT filesystem beginning after the first <N> blocks (but more than
25 sectors IIRC -- more like after 50-100 KB, or maybe even more).
