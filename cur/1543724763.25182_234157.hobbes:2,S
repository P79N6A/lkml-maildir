Because, I think this particular case can only happen in sync
writeback.  Otherwise the inode_lock is not released in
__writeback_single_inode so the inode must be on the s_io list.  I
don't see wheter it makes any difference performance-wise whether the
inode is left on s_io or unconditionally moved to s_dirty, but this is
the smaller change.
