Hello all,
I was reading an article on EPIC ( Explicitly Parallel Instruction
Computing ) , a technique Intel is going to supply in their new
processor (named Merced) to be able to have the processor handle 2
instructions at the same time.
I was wondering if there were any plans on supporting that technique in
the Linux kernel-world, and if so, if there are any sites where more
info could be found. I searched the archives of the list, but I found no
references to any addresses, or even if the project existed.
If not, I think it might be worth considering taking this new technique
into the 2.3.x kernel series.
Greetings,
Nils Vogels.
