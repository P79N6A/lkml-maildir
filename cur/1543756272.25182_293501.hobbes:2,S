Is listing module parameters in kernel-parameters.txt the right thing
to do? (There are lots of them, not many are listed)
I see some options that might be better:
- Kconfig magic which extracts module_param* and MODULE_PARM_DESC from
  sources and appends them to help text.
- a userspace script, that goes trough all modules and generates
  kernel-module-parameters.txt for example.
- modinfo like tool (but i think it would require source or descriptions
  compiled in kernel)
