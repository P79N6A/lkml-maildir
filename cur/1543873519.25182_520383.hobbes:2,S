I haven't heard anything more on this thread.
I just wanted to double check.  The tree that failed did it include
commits: 
392ee1e6dd901db6c4504617476f6442ed91f72d and
9f35575dfc172f0a93fb464761883c8f49599b7a
Mostly I was wondering if any of my later work to sort out msi 
suspend/resume actually solved anything.
