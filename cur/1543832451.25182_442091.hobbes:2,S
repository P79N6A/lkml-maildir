This disagrees with the gcc (4.1.0) docs.  info --index-search='Extended Asm' gcc
  The ordinary output operands must be write-only; GCC will assume
  that the values in these operands before the instruction are dead and
  need not be generated.  Extended asm supports input-output or
  read-write operands.  Use the constraint character `+' to indicate
  such an operand and list it with the output operands.  You should
  only use read-write operands when the constraints for the operand (or
  the operand in which only some of the bits are to be changed) allow a
  register.
All spinlocks must be in memory, which conflicts with the "allow a
register" above.  I hope that the gcc docs are wrong, and read/write
operands can be used on memory as well as registers.  I would hate for
a future gcc to be more strict about this check and break the spinlock
code.  It is interesting that the next paragraph has no such
restriction.
  You may, as an alternative, logically split its function into two
  separate operands, one input operand and one write-only output
  operand.  The connection between them is expressed by constraints
  which say they need to be in the same location when the instruction
  executes.  You can use the same C expression for both operands, or
  different expressions.  For example, here we write the (fictitious)
  `combine' instruction with `bar' as its read-only source operand and
  `foo' as its read-write destination:
     asm ("combine %2,%0" : "=r" (foo) : "0" (foo), "g" (bar));
  The constraint `"0"' for operand 1 says that it must occupy the same
  location as operand 0.  A number in constraint is allowed only in an
  input operand and it must refer to an output operand.
