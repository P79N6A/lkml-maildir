copy_from_user called from context where sleeping is not allowed. No idea 
where this is comming from - it's not in your calltrace.

local_bh_enable called with irqs_disabled.
Your calltrace suggests it's called from sirdev_hard_xmit, i.e. the final 
spin_unlock_bh - definitedly a bad idea because netdev->hard_start_xmit
is already called with bh disabled. However, I'm not sure is this is the 
whole story because I fail to see who might call us with interrupts off.
Could you try the patch below?
