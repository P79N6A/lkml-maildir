Hi,
Is it possible for a netfilter hook registered during module insertion 
time to be removed by a userspace application (such as iptables) without 
the insertion of a new module? 
What I am trying to do is implement a hook for secure packet processing 
using netfilter. If however an attacker can remove this hook without 
inserting a new module or compromising the kernel in some way then the 
security level of this hook is compromised.
