I really think we should reintroduce the idea of "enough" inactive/free
pages, Andrea.
This way we avoid starving the page reclaiming work on only one zone when
we have a small zone under extreme pressure, while at the same time we
avoid breaking writeout clustering and the "fairness" of pte scanning.
Do you remember the "zone_inactive_plenty()/zone_free_plenty()" stuff
which we had back into pre10 ?
