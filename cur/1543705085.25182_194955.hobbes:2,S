This could be misleading, still.
I`ve had a situation in the past when a n+1`th 2.4 kernel had sound crashes
where none of the ...n`th didn`t have any.
I`ve narrowed it down to cpu overclocking... ;-)
It was a very intricate situation for the kernel crashed more or less
after a certain fixed amount of time of sound playing, no matter how
long ago the bootup happened...
