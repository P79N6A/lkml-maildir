  All processors are in iowait - i.e. waiting for IO.

  It seems like heavy disk/network activity. You can try running
vmstat 1
  It will print every second the situation of your memory / IO
subsystem. You should especially see the ---io--- column ('bi' means
blocks in, 'bo' blocks outputted). I guess they'd contain some
non-trivial values...
  BTW: I guess the processes wake up eventually, don't they?
