Never understood the dependencies here.  Do these two patches depend on something
else which is only-in-mm?
Also, I've been uncertainly sitting on
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/broken-out/tty-fix-tty-network-driver-interactions-with-tcget-tcset-calls-x86-fix.patch
for some time.  Is it ready to go into git-x86?
Thanks.
