This sounds like a good idea.  I have not yet checked out the GNOME
tool,
but it would be worth considering.
Some positives about documentation:
1.  it encourages good coding style, especially if the docs are
co-located
    with the code (inline documentation)
2.  it makes it easier for others to read your code, modify it, expand
on it
3.  it helps you to tell what the block of code is **supposed** to do
4.  it makes it easier for someone else to maintain your code 
5.  it helps you understand code you wrote 1 year or more ago
6.  it helps others to use interfaces you have designed, even if they
    don't need to read or modify the underlying code
7.  it is required for many projects and for many customers such as
those 
    for large banks, commercial entities, or DOD.

They should compliment each other.  Co-locating the docs with the code,
and encouraging updates of the docs when updating the code is a GOOD
idea.
For those wishing to learn an interface or about he code, docs are VERY
valuable.  Keeping the docs and code in sync is simply good programming
practice.  I have been using the SAME module header for 15 years and the
same header for procedures for nearly 10 years.  They meet the needs 
of my management and of all my customers.

Lack of docs encourages even worse code.  Have you tried maintaining
code
you wrote 5, 10, or even 15 years ago.  I have some C apps that I wrote
over 15 years ago that I ported to Linux -- the only way was to follow
the documentation and cookie crumbs (this procedure does A, B, C...).
One of the funniest stories about code and documentation was an EE 1
year
out of school who wrote a couple of hundred lines of 6809 assembler 
without the first comment.  He said it would work right the first time.
When he tried assembling it, it had over 300 errors!  It took him weeks 
to get it to work.

Mainly adds a bit more typing and encourages a bit more work.  Many
programmers **hate** the extra effort that it takes to properly document
their work, but that little bit of extra effort saves MUCH effort on 
the part of others that are trying to understand that work, use that
work,
or expand upon it.  It also help you to make sure that your code 
really does what you want it to do....
Some have described code like an iceberg.  The iceberg has 1/3-1/4 above
water and the rest below.  The 1/3-1/4 is the effort to write/debug the
initial version.  The 2/3-3/4 is the effort required to maintain that 
code.

For interfaces that are expected to remain fairly stable, in-line docs
that could be extracted into printable docs plus man pages would greatly 
facilitate applications programming using those interfaces.
