Zero problems only if you find having a single callout for every page 
acceptable. So the invalidate_range in your patch is only working 
sometimes. And even if it works then it has to be used on 2M range. Seems 
to be a bit fragile and needlessly complex.
"conversion of some page in pages"? A proposal to defer the freeing of the 
pages until after the pte_unlock?
