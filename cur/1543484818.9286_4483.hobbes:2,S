Subject: Why 4 HLTs  in bugs.h?

In the file $SRC/include/asm-i386/bugs.h, function check_hlt(), which prints
the "Checking 'hlt' instruction...Ok" message during bootup, why are there
4 HLTs?
__asm__ __volatile__("hlt ; hlt ; hlt ; hlt");
Why are 4 HLTs required? Isn't just 1 HLT sufficient to see if HLT indeed
works? Why is such a check required? Is it to check whether interrupts can
indeed drive the processor out of HALT mode (and continue bootup?)
