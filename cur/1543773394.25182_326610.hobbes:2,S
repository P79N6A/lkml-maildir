That's easily fixable. However, it's likely to irritate SOME people on
each list. What I suggest is subscribing to bugme-new@lists.osdl.org,
(which will get you one email for each new bug) and have someone in that 
group take responsiblity for forwarding new bugs in the relevant 
categories to the list (there are headers to filter on). A simple 
procmail filter should suffice ... but I'm not willing to take
responsibility for automated emailt to lists I'm not even subscribed to ;-)
