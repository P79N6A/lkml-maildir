Well it's a problem if it doesn't work.

If you want to AND off a bit, AND off a bit. Don't try to fool the
tools. Tools are often broken if you try "tricks".
The intermediate code show all:
	.file	"xxx.c"
	.version	"01.01"
gcc2_compiled.:
.text
	.align 4
.globl foo0
	.type	 foo0,@function
foo0:
	pushl %ebp
	movl %esp,%ebp
	movl 8(%ebp),%eax
	andl $2147483647,%eax ! Just AND if off, fine.
	leave
	ret
.Lfe1:
	.size	 foo0,.Lfe1-foo0
	.align 4
.globl foo1
	.type	 foo1,@function
foo1:
	pushl %ebp
	movl %esp,%ebp
	movl 8(%ebp),%edx
	leal 0(,%edx,2),%eax  ! Good grief
	sarl $1,%eax          ! Arithmetic shift extends sign
	leave
	ret
.Lfe2:
	.size	 foo1,.Lfe2-foo1
.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"%d\n"
.text
	.align 4
.globl main
	.type	 main,@function
main:
	pushl %ebp
	movl %esp,%ebp
	pushl $-1
	call foo0
	pushl %eax
	pushl $.LC0
	call printf
	pushl $-1
	call foo1
	pushl %eax
	pushl $.LC0
	call printf
	xorl %eax,%eax
	leave
	ret
.Lfe3:
	.size	 main,.Lfe3-main
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 2.7.2.3"
So, the double-shift is truly broken. Just AND it and be done with it.
Cheers,
