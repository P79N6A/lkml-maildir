I will see if I can generate some debug code to check out this posibility.

I backed the commit out of my latest git pull (app 2am this morning) and I 
end up with a working kernel so this confirms that is is somthing 
specific to this patch.
I will try adding in a flush_cache_page() at an appropriate point on the 
pre-commit version of the code to see if that makes a mess of things.
