That is on a p1 150MMX 32MB PC, specifically an IBM ThinkPad 560E. It
will keep showing "booting the kernel, uncompressing" without going
any further. There will be some disk activity for at least 5-7 minutes
after that on a 5-10 seconds interval period, without change on the
screen. I tried removing framebuffer support or keep it but set
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT to 'n', but there is still the same output.
The bzimage is around 919Kb, I tried to make it as modular and small
as it gets to be "usefull" since I suspect this is too old to run 2.5,
but the bzimage still can't be less than 800-810 kilobytes.
