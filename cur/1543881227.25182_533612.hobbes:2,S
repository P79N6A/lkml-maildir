Trying to answer this question, I straced the mysql threads that
showed up in top when running a single threaded sysbench workload.
There were no mmap, munmap, brk, mprotect or madvise system calls
in the trace.
MySQL has me puzzled, but it seems to have some other people
interested too.
I think I'll go play a bit with ebizzy now, to see how other
workloads are affected by our kernel changes.
