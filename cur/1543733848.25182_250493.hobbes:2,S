No. But the point is, you cannot (easily) set something up like this:
"do some setup with this specific, valid cpu_online_map";
"register notifier so we can keep everything valid";
without a race between them. Protecting the notifier chain under a
different lock is the trivial fix. I'll send the patch if you'd
like?
