Hello every one !
I develop an operative system to work on a server machine and access to 
it from clients of diferent plataforms. The clients can execute 
aplications on server and access to special file system. This file 
system is created with a Firebird database.
My question: Like or have interest every one to create drivers for 
access to "TL System file system" from shell (bash) ?
The data base with basic structure is available on sourceforge.net and 
named "Top Level System" or "tlsystem"
Please send one mail to german@tecnoxarxa.com
thx
Note: My english is basic ;) sorry!
