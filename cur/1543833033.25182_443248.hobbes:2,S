I would prefer a more general parameter.  With this extension it is
expected to have six new interfaces.  I really don't want to repeat
this if somebody comes up with yet another nice extension.
So, how about generalizing the parameter.  Make is a 'flags'
parameter, assign a number of bits to the unshare functionality and
leave the rest available.  Use a 'f' suffix, perhaps.  Then in future
more bits can be defined and, if necessary, additional parameters can
be added depending on set flags.  The userspace prototypes can then if
absolutely necessary be extended with an ellipsis.  Not nice but not
as bad as adding more and more intefaces.
