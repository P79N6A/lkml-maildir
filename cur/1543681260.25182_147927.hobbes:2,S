I have seen this with 2.4.18 where USB after some time died with thge
message :
Jul 14 16:05:44 grobbebol kernel: usb.c: USB device not accepting new
address=12 (error=-110)
2.4.19 and 2.4.20 yielded me a non-working USB stack at all. 
2.4.21 works better but it happens after some time again. now, with a
kernel error :

and the camserv process in fact is the program which accesses the USB
device.
I looked at several googled pages some time ago but failed to see any
solutions so far.
I killed off camserv and tried to use my mass storage stuff (fujicam
finepix1300)
pluging in doesn't wake up[ the usb stuff (suse 8.0).
tried to mount :

I will try to rmmod usb et al and reload. if that fails, I think the
only option left is to restart.
