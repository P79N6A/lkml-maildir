well, one set thereof, the kernel mappings, which for this purpose are
the least interesting.

this installs a user space page table entry for your page; this is the
interesting one as it carries the user-dirty state.

Not quite, you would set that right after vmallocing, just set an
increasing page->index starting with 0 for the first page.
Then ensure your vma->vm_pgoff is 0 (which should be the case since
userspace will most likely mmap the whole thing, and if not it still
gets what it expects).

Yeah, page_mkclean_one(page, vma) will use vma_address() to obtain an
user-space address for the page in this vma using page->index and the
formula from the last email, this address is then used to walk the page
tables and obtain a pte.
This will be the user-space pte installed by your nopfn handler. Not the
kernel vmap pte resulting from the vmalloc() call.
