Sorry, see no problem which way?  My concern here is with getting
incorrect data, not getting no data.  The BIOS probe amounts to pulling
data out of two tables (INT 0x41/0x46, corresponding to BIOS drives 0x80
and 0x81 -- the EDD 1.1 spec is quite specific that if implemented they
follow the BIOS drive numbers, not the ATA port addresses), and hoping
that they actually match the drives that hd.c uses.  That scares me,
since we're talking about old legacy data here.
I'm not concerned with what's easy, I'm concerned with what's the right
thing to do.
