Cover Your Ass - or more politely, plan for likely future changes if there
isn't a high cost doing so.

I don't need to... the stat() call will tell me. If a /dev/cpu/0/microcode
exists it is more likely to be the correct loader for CPU0 than some
generic loader. Obviously if the user provides a name use it.

That's exactly why I mentioned using the per-cpu device if present. While
having CPUs with different loaders is not a feature today, I wouldn't bet
that will always be true. We know that AMD expects to ship dual core CPUs
in an Opteron form factor. If I have a dual opteron system and replace one
CPU with dual core, will I need a different loader? I have no idea, but
since it's easy to use the per-CPU microcode I would.

The obvious seems to be to see if the per-CPU device is present, and use
it if possible. I can't believe that it would be (by design) less correct
than the generic device.

Your distro and mine already have per-CPU microcode, that's the present.
Lots of people just compile and run, that's the present. It's easy to
check for /dev/cpu/N/micorcode first, then /dev/cpu/microcode, I think
that's the future. I just like having code try a little harder to do the
right thing, Linux should be easy.
