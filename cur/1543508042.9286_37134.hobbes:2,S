My BIOS does have an option to toggle on/off for PnP OS.  I tried
both, and it doesn't change anything for me.
Here's what lspci has to say about the USB device:
00:01.2 USB Controller: Intel Corporation 82371AB PIIX4 USB (rev 01)
	Control: I/O+ Mem- BusMaster- SpecCycle- MemWINV- VGASnoop- ParErr- Stepping- SERR- FastB2B-
	Status: 66Mhz- UDF- FastB2B+ ParErr- DEVSEL=medium >TAbort- <TAbort- <MAbort- >SERR- <PERR-
	Interrupt: pin D routed to IRQ 0
	Region 4: I/O ports at fce0
Now, I suspect I have this problem because the laptop is 2 years old,
before there was good OS support for USB.  BTW, the BIOS is Phoenix
4.1 (if I recall the version correctly).
Of course, if I try 'setpci -s 0:1.2 INTERRUPT_LINE=0b', I get this
when I query the INTERRUPT_LINE register:
00:01.2:3c = 0b
But 'lspci' still shows IRQ 0.  That was the reason for Martin's
comment to allow some way to hack in the IRQ, even if the BIOS does
not allow it (or more likely, does not provide a means).
