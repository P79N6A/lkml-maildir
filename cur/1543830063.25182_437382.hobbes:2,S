Subject: [Suspend2][ 19/28] [Suspend2] Swapwriter memory needed.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/457

Return the number of pages needed by the swapwriter itself. This doesn't
include the block i/o code, which has its own routine.
