Agreed.

/somewhat/ true I'm afraid:  libata uses the SCSI layer for ATAPI 
devices because they are essentially bridges to SCSI devices.  It uses 
the SCSI layer for ATA devices because the SCSI layer provided a huge 
amount of infrastructure that would need to have been otherwise 
duplicated, /then/ massaged into coordinating between <jgarzik's ATA 
layer> and <SCSI layer> when dealing with ATAPI.
There is also a detail that was of /huge/ value when introducing a new 
device class:  distro installers automatically work, if you use SCSI. 
If you use a new block device type, that behaves differently from other 
types and is on a different major, you have to poke the distros into 
action or do it yourself.
IOW, it was the high Just Works(tm) value of the SCSI layer when it came 
to ATA (not ATAPI) devices.
For the future, ATA will eventually be more independent (though the SCSI 
simulator will be available as an option, for compat), but the value is 
big enough to put that task on the back-burner.
