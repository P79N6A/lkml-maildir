Subject: S3 with pata_via fails to resume, ide_via82Cxxx works

Hi,
On a system (Commell LE365) with VIA CX700M chipset I experience
varying resume results:
When built with IDE subsystem and VIA82CXXX driver the system suspends
and resumes properly [2.6.28].

CONFIG_HAVE_IDE=y
CONFIG_IDE=y
CONFIG_IDE_TIMINGS=y
CONFIG_IDE_GD=y

CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEACPI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_SFF=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_VIA82CXXX=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
# CONFIG_ATA is not set
-----
When built with ATA subsystem and PATA_VIA driver the system suspends
but hangs during resume (HDD LED remains active) [2.6.28] though it
manages to resume when the CompactFlash card is disconnected [2.6.27].

# CONFIG_IDE is not set
CONFIG_ATA=y
CONFIG_ATA_ACPI=y
CONFIG_SATA_AHCI=y
CONFIG_ATA_SFF=y
CONFIG_SATA_VIA=y
CONFIG_PATA_VIA=y
-----
Is there some known bigger difference between behavior of both drivers?
I might start comparing behavior of both drivers and try to adjust
PATA_VIA to successfully resume the system, though any hint/suggestion
is welcome!
- SATA HDD with system partition  [seen as IDE Primary master]
- CompactFlash card               [seen as IDE Secondary slave]

Secondary note, with ATA subsystem it is possible to discover hot-plugged
second SATA drive with issuing
  echo '- - -' > host0/scsi_host/host0/scan
though the same action causes the access to first SATA drive to fail after
removing second drive. (unfortunately BIOS does only allows configuring
the chipset in IDE mode - so not possible to use SATA_VIA or AHCI).
I guess this is caused by some incorrect detection of speed settings.
What is the way to ask driver to rescan with IDE driver?
