Stupid question time: isn't this what the LGPL was designed to do?  The
Library GPL, so people who compiled stuff with gcc and linked it with
glibc wouldn't necessarily be gpl-ing their binary by doing so?  (Or the
leprosy GPL, or whatever Stallman's renamed it this month.  The license
text hasn't changed...)
