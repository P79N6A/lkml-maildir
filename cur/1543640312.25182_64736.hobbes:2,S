I downloaded my patches through the mailing list and applied them:
bash-2.05a$ cat ./driver.patch | patch -p1 -l -d linux
patching file drivers/base/interface.c
bash-2.05a$ cat ./driver2.patch | patch -p1 -l -d linux
patching file drivers/base/base.h
patching file drivers/base/core.c
patching file drivers/base/interface.c
It applies cleanly but . . .
You're right the tabs are gone although when I applied my originals they 
weren't.  I hate netscape navigator.  I gzipped them so netscape can't 
mess them up.  In the meantime I'm going to download mutt.  Thanks for 
your help.  Let me know if the patch works this time.  Also after 
looking at the interface code I realized that not just my code used 
sprintf.  Do you think they should all use snprintf instead or is the 
probability of a driver attribute exceeding the one page buffer size so 
low that it doesn't matter?
Also I was wondering if you think resource management variables (irq, 
io, dma, etc) should live in the device structure like power management 
variables do?  Global resource management seams interesting to me, 
although there already is a proc interface that does list resources, I'm 
wondering if the driver model is a good place to put such an interface?
Thanks,
-Adam
