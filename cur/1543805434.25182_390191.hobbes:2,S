Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Modify kernel/power/process.c header to describe how the new freezer
implementation works.

+ * It contains the routines used to freeze processes during a suspend
+ * cycle (or perhaps in future, a process migration).
+ *
+ * When quiescing the whole system, one process initiates this
+ * functionality by calling freeze_processes(). First, userspace
+ * is frozen. Then bdevs for mounted filesystems are frozen so
+ * as to ensure pending I/O is flushed and stopped. Finally,
+ * kernel threads which are no marked as unfreezeable (perhaps
+ * because they're needed for doing I/O) are frozen. Splitting
+ * kernel threads from userspace also improves reliability,
+ * because it ensures that a userspace thread doesn't deadlock,
+ * waiting for a kernel thread that has already been frozen to
+ * process some request, and because it stops the cause of most
+ * work for kernel threads (ie userspace), allowing those thread
+ * to complete their work more quickly.
