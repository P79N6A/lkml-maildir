Since klibc is meant for compiling programs tightly bound to the kernel
in initramfs, such as partition scanning, NFS root mounting, module
loading etc., I wonder what the problem with even a GPLed klibc is?
Surely all the programs that its intended to be used with will be GPLed,
perhaps even part of the kernel source tree?
(Not that I mind at all.  I expect I will be using klibc's simplicity
and 3-clause BSD license in my employer's proprietary product soon enough..)
