IOAT is super-neat stuff.
In addition to helping speed up network RX, I would like to see how 
possible it is to experiment with IOAT uses outside of networking. 
Sample ideas:  VM page pre-zeroing.  ATA PIO data xfers (async copy to 
static buffer, to dramatically shorten length of kmap+irqsave time). 
Extremely large memcpy() calls.
Additionally, current IOAT is memory->memory.  I would love to be able 
to convince Intel to add transforms and checksums, to enable offload of 
memory->transform->memory and memory->checksum->result operations like 
sha-{1,256} hashing[1], crc32*, aes crypto, and other highly common 
operations.  All of that could be made async.
