As I mentioned many times, this notifier is very effective in the
clustering system. Actually the Red Hat's kernel has a notifier
at the same point like this patch. I know a real system that failover
of DB server is immediately done by using this notifier.
It takes much cost to keep consistency of transaction processing
on DB system. Therefore, to shorten down time, it is very important
to immediately know that the system dies. In a mission critical system,
millisecond order or less is demanded.
The processing of the notifier is to make a SCSI adaptor power off to
stop writing in the shared disk completely and then notify to standby-node.
But as you think, it is sure not to necessarily become this scenario.
For instance, if the kernel hangs, the failure can be detected only
by heart-beat. In this case the detection time becomes longer.
Anyway this notifier is very effective and important in the actual world. 
Another example is as follows:
