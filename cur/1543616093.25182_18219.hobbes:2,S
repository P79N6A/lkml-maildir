Don't you think it's better to split this in "external" headers (placed
in include/sound together with asound.h) and "internal" ones (placed in
drivers/*/)?
To present kernel space struct layout for specific hardware to user
space does not seem a lot sensible to me (and might also give some
errors unless nasty #ifdef __KERNEL__ tricks).
