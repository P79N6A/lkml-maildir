Will do. Thanks for the detailed review!

I just used those typedefs in order to match the style in all the
other alsa drivers. For example:
% egrep typedef $lintree/sound/pci/*.c
als4000.c:typedef struct {
atiixp.c:typedef struct snd_atiixp atiixp_t;
atiixp.c:typedef struct snd_atiixp_dma atiixp_dma_t;
atiixp.c:typedef struct snd_atiixp_dma_ops atiixp_dma_ops_t;
atiixp.c:typedef struct atiixp_dma_desc {
azt3328.c:typedef struct _snd_azf3328 azf3328_t;
azt3328.c:typedef struct azf3328_mixer_reg {
bt87x.c:typedef struct snd_bt87x bt87x_t;
cmipci.c:typedef struct snd_stru_cmipci cmipci_t;
<snip>
I'm not sure what to do. I'd be happy to take them out. But I woudn't
mind leaving them in if that's what alsa convention is.

How embarrassing. Will fix. :-)

Looks like I stopped using index after I found I don't need to track
the individual descriptors. I'll take it out.

In this case I think the code is correct as it is. I check that in the
top level irq status register if the irq was from the cs5535 audio. I
return NONE if it wasn't there. Then I proceed to read a bunch of
other registers, all with the assumption that the irq was from us. I
return HANDLED at that point since reading those other registers has
cleared any irq from us even if it was from an unexpected src.

Yes, Takashi pointed that out too. But I did the patch against 13.1
which doesn't have kzalloc. I guess I'll redo the patch against -mm
and switch to kzalloc.

Will do.

Ok. Will look at that.

The 5535 hw's dma descriptor is only 32 bit capable. I guess I should
look into informing the dma alloc that the buffers need to be in the
lower 32. Would it be okay to drop the upper then?
From a practical standpoint, the 5535 is only used in x86-32
embeddeded systems so high mem probably won't occur. But you are
right, I'll go and try make it right.

Ok. I'll change that.
