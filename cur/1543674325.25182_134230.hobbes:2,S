We're not at liberty to do this because /proc/sys/fs/dentry-state and
inode-state are implemented assuming that these structs are an array of
integers.  It'll screw up if the architecture's "int" and "atomic_t"
representations are different.
Probably you can just make this an integer and add a spinlock for it, or
not place it in dentry_stat.
Seems otherwise OK though.  Thanks.
