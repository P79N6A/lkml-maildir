There are two separate things to consider here.  One is struct device 
and the other is struct class.
We know that replacing semaphores with mutexes in struct device doesn't 
sit well with lockdep.  However the replacement may work perfectly 
smoothly for struct class.  It would be worthwhile for Dave Young to 
separate out just that part and try it.
