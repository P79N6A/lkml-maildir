Yes, thanks.

As I said, _either_ you stick a "continue;" after recovering from the
error above this code (i.e. if the sysfs_create_link() just above this
line fails), _or_ you'll have to move the strcpy() up (above the
sysfs_create_link). Note that recovering fully would mean
unregistering the kobject for that target, deleting the node from the
modify_list and kfree'ing the struct netconsole_target *nt (otherwise
we'll have a memory leak on our hands). And if we've kfree'd nt, we'll
oops on trying to dereference it like we're doing in the strcpy here.
Thanks,
Satyam
