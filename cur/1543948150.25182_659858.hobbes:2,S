Ah, you confused me. Well, I confused me - this does deserve a comment
its tricksy.
Its correct. The trick is, the mem_reserve in question (res) need not be
connected to mem_reserve_root.
In that case, mem_reserve_root.pages will not change, but we do
propagate the change as far up as possible, so that
mem_reserve_connect() can just observe the parent and child without
being bothered by the rest of the hierarchy.
