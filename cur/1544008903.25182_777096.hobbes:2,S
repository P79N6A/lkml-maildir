Ok, but why not postpone calling .device_alloc_chan_resources() until a 
channel is _found_? Calling it for all channels just because one client 
has once called dmaengine_get() and _probably_ will poll if any channels 
become available - doesn't it look like an overkill?

Hm, interesting, so that's why you want dma_find_channel() as light-weight 
as possible?
