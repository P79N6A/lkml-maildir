The registers I want to read are from a SPI device (a SPI slave attached
to a SPI bus). I need to use SPI bus transfers to access them.

If I read the API correctly reading/writing a byte from the SPI bus
(synchronously) always implies putting the task doing the read to sleep:
int spi_transfer(struct spi_msg *msg, void (*callback) (struct spi_msg
*, int))
{
...
	err = TO_SPI_BUS_DRIVER(bus->driver)->queue(msg);
	wait_for_completion(&msg->sync);
...
}
So, how can I, from an interrupt handler, read/write a couple of bytes
from my SPI device using this API?
