I am surprised as many people as this are missing,
* when you have an active process using ~300M of VM, in a ~380M machine,
2/3 of the machine's RAM should -not- be soaked up by cache
* when you have an active process using ~300M of VM, in a ~380M machine,
swap should not be full while there is 133M of RAM available.
The above quoted is top output, taken during the several minutes where
cc1plus process was ~300M in size.  Similar numbers existed before and
after my cut-n-paste, so this was not transient behavior.
I can assure you, these are bugs not features :)
