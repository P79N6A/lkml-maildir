Intel claim its a one way off switch per boot. C't I think it was published
some tricks to get around this but they appear to alter the BIOS settings
and then reboot. Not something that will go unnoticed on a Linux box even
if it does under that other OS. Phil Karn and Ingo's patches both turn it
off regardless of BIOS setting
Don't worry. You've got unique ethernet, disk firmware revision and possibly
even BIOS serial numbers you can't turn off anyway
