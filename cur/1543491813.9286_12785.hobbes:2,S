The driver tells you that target 4 gives up COMMAND PHASE (2) and switched 
to STATUS PHASE (3) without having accepted the last 2 bytes of the 
command.

Same here but the device switched to MESSAGE IN PHASE and just discards 4 
bytes of the command.

Now the kernel complains about some attempt to read outside of a partition
or a device.

If you didn't experience similar problem before, it is perhaps the thing
that messed up the PCI BUS, the SCSI sub-system or the kernel. It seems to
me that your NCR53C860 has been victimized by some serious problem on your
system. The following cause could be investigated: 
- PCI BUS problem due to broken chip-set of misconfiguration.
- Memory problem that affects DMA from the PCI BUS.
- Kernel or driver bug outside the ncr driver that makes some garbaged
  command go to the SCSI device.
- vfat inconsistency problem that confused the kernel vfat code, or some 
  bug in the kernel vfat code that has been triggered.
