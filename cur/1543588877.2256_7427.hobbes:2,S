Well, it isn't that.
Still, it was recently discussed that X might leave some settings in the
video-card (Matrox).
So I tried the following:
time spdtest.sh before X with spdtest.sh:
#!/bin/sh
i=1
while [ $i -lt 500 ]
do
   clear
   echo $i
   cat test.out;
   i=`expr $i + 1`
done
and after X, no change.
This is a G400/32 Mb with framebuffer @ 1600x1200x16bpp, and X 4.0.3,
same resolution. Kernel 2.4.3-ac12, Abit VP6 dual P3/866.
There was no significant change in any of the reported times.
I don't know. Your problem is interesting. Do other programs have this
too?
