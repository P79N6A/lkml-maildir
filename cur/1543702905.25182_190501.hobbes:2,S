However as soon as I start up X with KDE I get regular spin ups every 30 seconds. Looking at the output of "echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/block_dump", I see an entry every 30 seconds of "kdeinit(15145): WRITE block 65680 on hda1" followed by a whole load of "reiserfs/0(12): dirtied page" and "reisers/0(12): WRITE block XXXXX on hda1".
