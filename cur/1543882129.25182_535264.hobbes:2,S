Yes, but what you seem to be proposing is that lower layers be
able to treat non-contiguous pages as one IO artifact - like
non-contiguous-compound-pages. Ultimately both are probably needed. i.e.
Use contiguous pages for large blocks where possible but be able to deal
with the compound page consisting of multiple smaller pages with a
regression in performance when necessary.
I don't think what Christoph and Nick are proposing are mutually
exclusive. The arguement is really "which do we deal with first".

They won't be creating filesystems with large blocks for a start but
even if they did, they would need to your proposal.
Again, I don't think they are mutually exclusive as such.

That involves creating a vmalloc-like area or breaking the 1:1 physical:virtual
mapping in the kernel address space. Of those two, I think a vmalloc area
would be easier, have less performance impact and might even be a starting
point for non-contiguous-compound-pages.
hmm.

Page coloring has come up a lot in the past. Can you point me at an
example you have in mind and I'll see if the same arguments really
apply.
