Unfortunatly, bprm->recursion_depth was added in 2.6.28-rc1, so this
patch can't easily apply to the 2.6.27.y tree :(
Should I also apply commit id bf2a9a39639b8b51377905397a5005f444e9a892:
	From: Kirill A. Shutemov <kirill@shutemov.name>

	Subject: [PATCH] Allow recursion in binfmt_script and binfmt_misc
To get this one to apply properly?
Hm, in looking at bf2a9a39639b8b51377905397a5005f444e9a892, that seems
like a valid fix for the 2.6.27.y series as well, so perhaps I should do
this anyway.
Any objections to that?
thanks,
