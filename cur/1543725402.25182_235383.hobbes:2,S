2.6 is a stable kernel series used in production environments.
The correct solution is to fix XFS (and other problems with 4kb stacks   
if they occur), and my patch is only a short-term workaround.
4KSTACKS=n is simply the better tested case, and 4KSTACKS=y uncovers 
some issues you might not want to see in production environments.
