Hmmm ... 'struct array_cache' looks to be about 6 integer words,
so if that is the main per-CPU cost, the minimal cost of a slab
cache (once created, before use) is about 24 bytes per cpu.
But whether its 24 or 128 bytes per cpu, that's a heavier weight
hammer than is needed here.
Time for me to learn more about rcu.
Thanks for raising this issue.
