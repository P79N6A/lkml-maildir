Hi All,
I have a lot of unaligned accesses in kernel space:
kernel unaligned acc    : 2191330
(pc=fffffffc002557d8,va=fffffffc00256059)
It seems to be located in the networking part (iptables?) from the
kernel. Can someone please help me how to find the location of these
uac's? I already have recompiled the kernel with debugging enabled and
tried to debug it with gdb. 
Another question: What's the meaning of va?
Thank you very much!
Regards
Marc
