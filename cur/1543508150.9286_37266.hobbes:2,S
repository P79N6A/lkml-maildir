All well and good until you have to deal with PCMCIA, hot-swap PCI,
and other dynamic busses.  You don't have the luxury of having a single
time where you can enumerate everything -- devices could be added later
that are not present at startup, etc.
I used to be very skeptical about modules for this sort of thing, but
after working with an OS that only loads drivers dynamically, I can say
there are some nice things about it.  
Handling strange conditions is also nice for driver developers -- you
can get a bit more debugging time if the system is graceful under odd
conditions.
