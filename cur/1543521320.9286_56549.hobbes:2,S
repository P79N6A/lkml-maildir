i get problems with the new version too.  i'd like to look into this,
but i am having trouble finding information.  btw where does one post
fixes/patches?  linux-kernel, linux-network, linux-tulip, donald
becker?  is this driver part of the normal linux maintainence or does
everything route through becker?
how does one find development versions of the tulip driver?  i have
0.89h from the old_tulip.c, 0.91g is the new tulip.c and 0.91 is
available on the tulip website at
<URL:
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip-devel.html>
where are 0.91a through 0.91f?  do these even exist?  have they ever
existed?  0.89h and 0.91 work for me, but 0.91f does not.  the diff
between 0.91 and 0.91f is large.  in order for me to track the problem
down, it would help to be able to regress to find a smaller
difference.
my problem is that my tulip 21041 gets called a 21143 and then
everything stops.  for details, see
<URL:
http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9912_02/msg00828.html>
i forwarded a similar message to the tulip-bugs list but there was no
response.  i note that
<URL:
http://beowulf.gsfc.nasa.gov/listarchives/linux-tulip/1999/05/0067.html>
had the same problem with 0.91e.  i deduce that 0.91e once existed.  where
do i find that?
also, many of the links on 
<URL:
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html>
leading to
<URL:
http://www.bmen.tulane.edu/~siekas/tulip.html>
are dead as it seems, unfortunately, that greg siekas is no longer
maintaining them (for whatever reason).  do these pages still exist?
are they wanting a new home?
thanks
