No, it is a broken feature in *LINUX* post 2.4.20pre3, it's not broken in
FreeBSD or Tru64.  Regardless of what Trond says about soft mounts they
should work in Linux just as well as they do in other OSes, such as FreeBSD.
I've tried to debug and I have seen no timeouts.  I believe something is up
with the congestion routines that were added.
Yes, hard mounts work.  But so soft ones.  Linux should not have a
broken NFS.
