That's not the issue.
The real issue is the _physical_ address. Nothing else matters.
If the TLB splitting on the fixed MTRRs is an issue, it depends entirely 
on what physical address the kernel resides in, and the virtual address is 
totally inconsequential.
So playing games with virtual mapping has absolutely no upsides, and it 
definitely has downsides.
