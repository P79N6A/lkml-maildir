it maps one of the PCI slots interrupts to 13 instead of 14. When mapped
to 14, the IDE support doesn't work.

this patch will break IDE support. I'm using
     sio_pci_fixup(noname_map_irq, 0x0b0a0f09);
which will break sound on the UDB again. Mapping the PCI interrupt to 13
is a bug, because it's not possible with the SIO ISA bridge. I've no
idea, which piece will break, when we map it to 5 or 7. It might work
to share a interrupt (depends on the used devices/drivers), but I haven't
tried that.

   This device has completely bogus header. Compaq scores again :-|
It's a host bridge, but it should be called ghost bridge instead ;^)
