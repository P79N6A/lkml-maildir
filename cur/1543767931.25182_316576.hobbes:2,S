Yeah - I skirted that.  I like kexec by itself for quick reboots but
I honestly haven't used it much for that.  I am *really* interested
in kdump + kexec, and kdump depends on kexec.  Working with two moving
targets has been a bit more challenging, hence I'd prefer to see kexec
stable as a provider technology so we can address the bugs and build
the kdump support on top.

I'll see if we can find a way to make this happen - even tracking
a little web page of "My IBM T41p successfully ran kexec" or "My
G5 ran kexec" would be useful info, I think as a starting point.
Something like:
Hardware	Ran kexec	Ran kdump	Kdump was useful
should be enough to record some success, as at least a starting point.

Now *this* I completely agree with.  That is the ultimate goal.  And,
we've had challenges with this internally because kexec & kdump have
been under so much churn.  We have a grid of machines for testing, and
I *know* we get a bunch of Oopses during development.  We have someone
looking into integrating kexec/kdump into that environment so that every
Ooops leads to a crash dump.  It has been rough going with kexec & kdump
in churn, so stabilizing will actually help us with this.

Completely agreed.

Understood.  We'll do what we can from our end but as always, help from
any quarter is appreciated.

Yes.  I'll push this a little more on Monday from our side and maybe we
can get a little independent help/verification from Randy, Eric, etc.
