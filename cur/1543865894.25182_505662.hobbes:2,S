A few weeks ago I found the solution, which I report here to help
people who are googling for the same problem.
consistent_alloc() performed all the required magic to allocate
a contiguous buffer in phisical memory:
 -       if (!(fb_info.shadow = (void *)__get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL, OLED_MEMORDER))
 +       if (!(fb_info.shadow = consistent_alloc(GFP_KERNEL, PAGE_ALIGN(OLED_MEMSIZE),
 +                       &fb_info.shadow_phys, PTE_BUFFERABLE))
The complete patch set is here, just in case:
