Hi,
I can reproduce a autofs bug whereby the autofs filesystem cannot be
unmounted.
It is simple: first mount the autofs filesystem. I have RH5.2 so to do
this I use /etc/rc.d/init.d/autofs start
Now I mount my CD rom drive by doing cd /misc/cd
This next step seems to break things. _Manually_ umount /misc/cd, rather
than letting autofs timeout (before doing the the cwd will need to be
moved from /misc/cd :-)
Now, /misc cannot be unmounted, it is permanently reported as busy. Not
good.
Cheers
Chris
