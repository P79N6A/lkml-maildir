Whew, you clearly put enough work into this to get it working!  Thanks.
I look forward to trying it at some point.  (I have some new hardware
in hand that should make that possible.)

My 'signed off' was omitted intentionally, because I wasn't
actually submitting the patch.  It needed work.  :)
Can't speak for Mike, but what he seeded me with was a
tarball that worked with a preliminary version of the SPI
stack on a ColdFire uClinux package.   Not a patch.

Yeah, I have such changes in my updated version too.

You should have asked for the implementation.  The idea was
that I'd find out who was working with that code!  ISTR posting
both patches a while back.
The claim is necessary, because otherwise there's no way to
ensure that the chipselect stays active in various parts of
the protocol that require it.  A given MMC transaction can
require multiple spi_message invocations, and without the
claim there is no way to _guarantee_ that the chipselect is
not dropped ... the bus could be given for example to some
other SPI device while the MMC-over-SPI driver was figuring
out the next transaction to issue.

That could be a problem.  :)

Yeah, that timeout mechanism was more of a "write one quick"
than something that handled all the necessary corner cases.

ISTR not reliably getting to the point where STOP would be issued.
You must have fixed at least some of the issues in the way ... :)

Likewise.  I translated Mike's code to the newer version of the
SPI framework, added a generalizable solution to that claim/release
problem (he had one specific to his ColdFire system), and made it
get part way through enumeration.  At that point, I expected it
would be best if some other folk helped, as you've done!

It's been some time since I looked at that, but ISTR that there
was special casing to handle that.  Isn't that one of the commands
that doesn't make sense over SPI, but which the MMC core insists
on issuing anyway?

Or maybe it didn't get far enough to trip over that stuff ... :)

The whole error mapping thing needed more attention.  ISTR that
Mike's original code didn't have much fault handling code at
all, and it wasn't clear to me how some of the fault should work.

I'm quite surprised by that ... why would it make any kind of
difference at all?

That sounds good.  As I noted above, I was just trying to get
Mike's code to play in the updated SPI framework, and hadn't
gotten it to fully work yet, much less worried about speed.

Which can be a real problem...

No, the MMC layer was explicitly setting the speed to zero.
That is an idiom used in various frameworks for clock gating.

MULTIWRITE is generally agreed to be a win on hardware that
supports it.  Just like DMA.  :)

I don't recall having particular problems there, FWIW.

Fair enough.  The issue is more lack of a hard reset capability
than a power management thing; the reset being a side effect of
powering the card on/off.

Me either.  I saw Pierre's note though.  When is that expected

I figured the first order of business was to have the driver
work.  I'm not sure what exactly you mean by "behind each other"
but ISTR noticing some oddities coming down from mmc_block.
Maybe the new framework will resolve those issues.

I guess you're right about that.  Of course, supporting the
interrupt line should be easy enough; SPI devices have always
been used with IRQs, unlike for example I2C (where the devices
have, but the Linux drivers couldn't portably do so).

I basically looked around at the "card socket" abstractions I
found, and used the one from PXA.  Note that "get_ro" is not
interrupt driven ... and normally I'd want card detect to work
by irq.  Admittedly it's common that input GPIOs can be used
in both modes, but some systems only deliver IRQs and don't
provide a driver-visible card detect signal.  (And you suggest
below that you may have the converse problem, an IRQ-incapable
GPIO signal that must be polled.)

Can't your GPIO pin trigger IRQs too though?  That's the normal
way to use that callback:  from the IRQ handler.  See how it's
done in arch/arm/mach-pxa/lubbock.c for one example.

I think so.  The MMC framework notices "no card" when nothing
responds.

Yes, that was a "look at this later, once it basically works"
kind of issue.  Once the upper layers behave, that was the other
lower level issue that needed attention.  (The first being the
chipselect claim/release model.)

ISTR having some document specifying 125 KHz as the max possible
until later.
