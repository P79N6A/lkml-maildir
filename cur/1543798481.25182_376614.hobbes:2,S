From my reading of the code it's a way for mac/misc.c to send a packet that
starts with CUDA_PACKET or PMU_PACKET instead of ADB_PACKET, but otherwise
is the same as normal adb_request() ones...
Used for access to timer, nvram, etc. - looks like that puppy used to
use the same protocol for more than just ADB and the first byte of packet
really selects the destination...
