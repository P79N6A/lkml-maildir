Subject: [PATCH] mptbase: Reset ioc initiator during PCI resume
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

It appears that the LSI SAS 1064E chip needs to be reset after a
suspend/resume cycle before the driver attempts further communications with
the chip.  Without this patch, resuming the chip results in this error
message being printed repeatedly and no more disk I/O.
mptbase: ioc0: ERROR - Invalid IOC facts reply, msgLength=0 offsetof=6!
So far it seems to fix suspend/resume on all the MPT Fusion cards I have
(SAS and U320 SCSI) but since I don't know the internals of that chip I
can't say for sure if this is a proper fix.
