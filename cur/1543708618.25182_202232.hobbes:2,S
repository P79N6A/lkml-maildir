Hi Nick,
I started getting some results with dbt-2 on 2.6.3 and saw that reiser4
is doing a bit worse with the AS elevator.  Although reiser4 wasn't
doing well to begin with, compared to the other filesystems.  I have
links to the STP results on our 4-ways and 8-ways here:

I noticed that __preempt_spin_lock was near the top of the profile and
about 2 times higher the with AS, compared to deadline.
I'm going to run through the other filesystems to see how the elevators
affect them.
