Have a look at the mouse patch. I've only seen three status packets:
USB_ST_NOERROR: normal
USB_ST_REMOVED: suspend/disable the device
USB_ST_INTERNALERROR: ditto, only seen it rarely
USB_ST_TIMEOUT and any others: printk and ignore, didn't used to occur up
  to 2.3.13 and hopefully should disappear again in 2.3.17

It works fine on 2.3.13-2.3.16. I posted it before I had tried it
on 2.3.16 but have been using it for a couple of days on that kernel
now.
