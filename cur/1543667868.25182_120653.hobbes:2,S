I think you have the old modutils unless Rusty changed the version numbers
drastically. From memory they are somewhere in
  ftp:ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rusty
However, your problem *might* be initrd if the drivers are not all built
in. The stock Redhat mkinitrd called by "make install" doesn't seem to
work, and Rusty has stated he has no intentions of providing a working
one. I'm told there's a new mkinitrd at Redhat, but I haven't found it (or
even looked very hard).
If you are building it all in I can't help.
