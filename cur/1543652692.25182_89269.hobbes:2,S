That makes driver debugging almost impossible. It also makes building a
test kernel set for a lot of boxes impractical. The completely broken
unload stuff is going to be a real pig, PCMCIA only works modular and
doesn't work now the unloads are all broken. OTOH the module rewrite has
some nice features and a combo modutils is going to sort some of the
problem out fairly easily.
The biggest need though is documentation so people can actually fix all
the drivers for this stuff.
