First of all I tried to find in the documentations and in the kernel release
diff's if Linux supports the scsi board NCR53C710. I just found obscurous
things about it.
I'm asking you if I will have to write the driver or is there an unoffical
patch for it?
Thanks in advance.
PS: The machine is a Compaq ProSignia.
