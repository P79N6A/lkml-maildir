Well.  Some of the time.  If the page was just read from swap, it's known
to be on the active list.

With the current implementation of page_referenced() the
software-referenced bit doesn't matter anyway, as long as the pte's
referenced bit got set.  So as long as the thing is on the active list, we
can simply remove the mark_page_accessed() call.
Except one day the VM might get smarter about pages which are both
software-referenced and pte-referenced.
