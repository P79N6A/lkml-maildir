this is a know deficiency in the vt "driver", and is noted in Andrew
Morton's "Things Not To Do" while requiring low scheduling latency. it
would be nice if the vt code was fixed sometime, but right now, i
think it can cause a scheduling delay for up to about 50ms.
btw, i think it is still the case the Andrew's patch provides more
reliable and lower absolute latency than the preemption patch.
