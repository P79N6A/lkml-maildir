Hi !
I've tested andrea's patch "buffer-2.2.9-E" during all the last week on a very
little and silent server : 386sx33/8Mb/500Mb/2*NE2000. This host serves me for
all sorts of tests and I can say that not only it seems to run slightly faster
with this patch, but now I've activated disk spin down and the disk can
stay down many hours now. This host is in my bedroom and I don't hear it
anymore during the night, but only when I connect to it. I haven't had any
problem during one week. Perhaps other people did, but if not, I think it
would be good to release it in next official kernels. It might be interesting
for notebooks ...
