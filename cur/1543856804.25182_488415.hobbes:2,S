Please explain in more details how hotplugging would be broken, possibly
with examples.

Nonsense. The purpose of $MODALIAS is to allow automatically loading
modules using the information provided by the bus driver.
Because of this reason there is no point for a driver to provide a
$MODALIAS referring to itself. It will only waste resources causing udev
to try loading it again.
