I am using Slackware Linux version 7 using Kernel 2.2.13
The kernel (not INIT) switches to graphics mode, and shows a penguin
around the time of the CPU test (speed check, floating point check, etc).
Then it does additional checks, like which drives you have, etc.
Then it mounts root, then loads INIT, which takes over and runs the scripts 
in inittab.
This graphic switch is indeed in the kernel somewhere. It has nothing to do 
with INIT.
In fact, I can use other generic kernels available in the distribution that 
do not
switch to graphic mode during bootup.
