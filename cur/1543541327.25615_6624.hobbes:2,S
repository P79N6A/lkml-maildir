You're not evil, the kernel lock is magic and the scheduler drops it when
entered (it is just used to get cooperative multitasking like in 2.0). There
fore you're allowed to sleep.  This is not true for other spinlocks. 
When you cannot sleep you should use kmalloc(..., GFP_ATOMIC), but it is 
less reliable than GFP_KERNEL.
