That's known bug in early glibcs short after adding vDSO support.
The vDSO support has been added in May 2003 to CVS glibc (i.e. post glibc
2.3.2) and the problems have been fixed when they were discovered, in
February 2004:

I strongly believe we want randomized vDSOs, people are already abusing the
fix mapped vDSO for attacks, and I think the unfortunate 10 months of broken
glibc shouldn't stop that forever.  Anyone using such glibc can still use
vdso=0, or do that just once and upgrade to somewhat more recent glibc.
