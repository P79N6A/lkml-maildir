i tried that patch on a box here, and it produces similar 4 lines:
[    0.172141] ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
[    0.175498] init IO_APIC IRQs
[    0.176059]  IO-APIC (apicid-pin) 2-16, 2-17, 2-18, 2-19, 2-20, 2-21, 2-22, 2-23 not connected.
[    0.187942] ..TIMER: vector=0x31 apic1=0 pin1=0 apic2=-1 pin2=-1
[    0.233859] ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
[    0.236014] ...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ...  failed.
[    0.236014] ...trying to set up timer as Virtual Wire IRQ... failed.
[    0.236014] ...trying to set up timer as ExtINT IRQ... works.
[    0.277879] Using local APIC timer interrupts.
but ... in all likelyhood it's some ACPI side-effects of the 
acpi_use_timer_override flag, not really this IO-APIC/timer-setup detail 
that matters.
