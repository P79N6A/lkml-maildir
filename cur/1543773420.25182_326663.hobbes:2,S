I've looked over the patches from today and they seem quite sane.  Comments 
pending...

The latest version incorporates changes from the last round of feedback 
(great work Sebastien!) and updates the library license, so people should 
definately take a closer look.  This includes the necessary changes for 
in-kernel signal support, as well as minimal conversion done on iocbs (the 
layout matches the in-kernel iocb).
A quick reading shows that most of it looks quite good.  I have to stare 
at the cancellation code a bit more closely, though.

This likely needs a rewrite with whatever the final semaphore operations 
turn out to look like, as it gets very easy to convert down() into 
aio_down() and that minimises the changes to the code.

I got the aio_down() variant working with cancellation now, and should be 
able to post an updated series of patches against 2.6.12 shortly.

What are folks thoughts in this area?  Zach's patches took the approach of 
making multishot iocbs possible, which helped avoid the overhead of plain 
aio_poll's command setup, which was quite visible in pipetest.  Zach -- did 
you do any benchmarking on your aio-epoll patches?

Zach also made some noises about this recently...
