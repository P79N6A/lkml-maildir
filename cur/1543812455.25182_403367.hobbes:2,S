hm.   It's actually rather hard.
One could do something like:
extern u64 __jiffy_data jiffies_64;
#define jiffies (*(u32 *)((long)&jiffies_64 + 2))
or
#if BITS_PER_LONG == 64
extern u64 __jiffy_data jiffies;
#define jiffies_64 jiffies
#else
extern union jiffy_thing {
#ifdef BIG_ENDIAN
	struct {
		u32 pad;
		u32 jiffies;
	},
	u64 jiffies_64;
#else
	u64 jiffies_64;
	struct {
		u32 pad;
		u32 jiffies;
	},
#endif
} __jiffy_data jiffies_thing;
#define jiffies_64 jiffies_thing.jiffies_64
#define jiffies jiffies_thing.jiffies
#endif
But then any code which uses `jiffies' as a local variable will explode.  I
guess we should rename those anyway.  include/linux/cyclades.h is one such.
Making `jiffies_64' a #define is less risky, but that doesn't work for
32-bit.

Yup.

I don't know.  I suspect its only observeable effect would be an
off-by-one-tick in wall_jiffies which will cancel out whereever anyone
takes a delta.
