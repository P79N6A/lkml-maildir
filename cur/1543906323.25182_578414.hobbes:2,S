select is evil....
select will by brute force set a symbol equal to 'y' without
visiting the dependencies.
So abusing select you are able to select a symbol FOO even 
if FOO depends on BAR that is not set.
In general use select only for non-visible symbols (no promts anywhere)
and for symbols with no dependencies.
That will limit the suefullness but on the other hand avoid the illegal
configurations all over.
kconfig should one day warn about such things but I have not fel inclined
to dive into the matters hoping that Roman does one day.
