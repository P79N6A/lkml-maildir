applied with two minor fixes (and sorry for being such a pedant ;):
* Summary line moved to patch description and "ide-floppy: cleanup header"
  used instead.  Please try to keep summary line within 80-columns limit,
  otherwise it makes git-log output etc ugly.
* I don't know why scripts/checkpatch.pl doesn't complain but quilt did:
  Warning: trailing whitespace in lines 44,46,61,62 of Documentation/ide/ChangeLog.ide-floppy.1996-2002
  so I fixed it manually.
