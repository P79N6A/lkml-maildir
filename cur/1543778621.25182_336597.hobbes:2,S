There a couple of possibilities, one is driver differences. SUSE ships
the SysKonnect vendor driver vs the older version in 2.6.12, and the
TCP congestion and TSO code has changed since 2.6.8.
What is the output of ethtool (ethtool -i and ethtool -k)?
Perhaps one driver has checksum offload on and the other off?
Could you get a tcpdump capture of a slow transfer?
