	There is no reason to use __pci_devinit for chipsets that are
only soldered into motherboards.  I believe there are only a few of
those quirk handlers that CONFIG_PCI_HOTPLUG users really need to
retain in their kernels.
	I would appreciate it if you would do the lspci commands I requested
or just send the contents of your /proc/bus/pci/devices file.
