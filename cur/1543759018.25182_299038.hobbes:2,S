  #if defined(CONFIG_FB_SAVAGE_ACCEL)
doesn't work with FB_SAVAGE_ACCEL=m, and
  #if defined(CONFIG_FB_SAVAGE_ACCEL) || defined(CONFIG_FB_SAVAGE_ACCEL_MODULE)
would break with FB_SAVAGE=y and FB_SAVAGE_ACCEL=m.
Is there any reason for these being three modules?
It seems the best solution would be to make this one module composed of 
up to three object files?
