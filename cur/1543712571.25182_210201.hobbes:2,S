Ok, here is the result for 2.6.5-rc2 (3 times middle, with preemption), 
compared to 2.4.25.
The result is, the performancedifference to 2.4.25 is the same as for 
2.6.4 as described above.
Nearly means: The real processing time is about 1% faster than under 
2.6.4, but 8.3% slower than with 2.4.25. The system-processortime is 1.2% 
faster than under 2.6.4 but 31,7% more than under 2.4.25. The times for 
the user-processortime is unchanged.
But I'm not shure if these values are really significant, because the 
values for the real time meassured each try differ a lot under 2.6.
For example 2.6.5rc2:
between 9.07 min and 8.37 min for real time.
Under 2.4.25, the differences are a lot of smaller: between 8.06 min and 
8.15 min for real time.
The values for user and system time are nearly constant with 6.49 min and 
36 sec (kernel 2.6) and 6.43 min / 27 sec for 2.4.25.
