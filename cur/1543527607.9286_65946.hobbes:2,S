That's precisely my point. And yes there were already some problems
compiling on the Alpha for which I hacked a solution into the Makefile.
But that's just an hack, which is not guaranteed to work in the future.
So you do need those files or you need the compiler options obtained after
processing them to be kept somewhere...
Is there any argument against creating include/compiler.options (or some other
name) containing something like:
CFLAGS= ....
LDFLAGS= ....
that you could use in your module's makefile:
include $(SRC)/include/compiler.options
?
