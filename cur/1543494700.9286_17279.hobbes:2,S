Just got in to my office today, my Linux box had this printed on the 
console:
set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 59 to 10
Kernel is 2.2.5, 25 day uptime. System does samba, apache+php3 and
mysql mainly.
Searching /var/log/kern.log produces this:
May  3 16:40:00 jade kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from 59 to 10
So, anyone have an explanation of what's happening here?
