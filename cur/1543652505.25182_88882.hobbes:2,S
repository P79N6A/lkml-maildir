Not true; the s390 also has a dirty bit in hardware ;-)
To make things more interesting, the s390 dirty bit does not
reside in the pte, but in a storage key associated with the
*physical* page.  The bit is set on any access to the physical
page, whether through any virtual mapping, by direct access
with dynamic address translation switched off, or by an I/O
device moving data directly to main memory.
