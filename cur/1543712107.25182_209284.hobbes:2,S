We should be clear about your argument here.  It is not that DM makes
generic morphing easy and possible, it is that with DM the most basic
types of morphing (no data striping or de-striping) is easily accomplished.
You sight two examples:
1) Adding another member to a RAID-1.  While MD may not allow this to
   occur while the array is operational, EMD does.  This is possible
   because there is only one entity controlling the meta-data.
2) Converting a RAID0 to a RAID4 while possible with DM is not particularly
   interesting from an end user perspective.
The fact of the matter is that neither EMD nor DM provide a generic
morphing capability.  If this is desirable, we can discuss how it could
be achieved, but my initial belief is that attempting any type of
complicated morphing from userland would be slow, prone to deadlocks,
and thus difficult to achieve in a fashion that guaranteed no loss of
data in the face of unexpected system restarts.
