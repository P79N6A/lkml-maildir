[regarding the buffer cache hash size and bad performance on machines
with little memory...  (<32MB)]

I experimented some, and increasing the huffer cache hash to the 2.2
levels helped a lot, especially for 16 MB memory.  The difference is huge,
64 kB in 2.2 vs 1 kB in 2.4 for a 32 MB memory machine.

Being able to tune the machine for both high and low end systems is
neccessary, and if Linux can tune itself, that's of course the best.

Nope, TCP performance seems more or less unchanged.  I will keep
investigating, and get back when I have more info.
