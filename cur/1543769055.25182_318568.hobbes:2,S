HT is _wonderful_ for latency reduction. 
Why people think "performace" means "throughput" is something I'll never
understand. Throughput is _always_ secondary to latency, and really only
becomes interesting when it becomes a latency number (ie "I need higher
throughput in order to process these jobs in 4 hours instead of 8" -
notice how the real issue was again about _latency_).
Now, Linux tends to have pretty good CPU latency anyway, so it's not
usually that big of a deal, but I definitely enjoyed having a HT machine
over a regular UP one. I'm told the effect was even more pronounced on 
XP. 
Of course, these days I enjoy having dual cores more, though, and with
multiple cores, the latency advantages of HT become much less pronounced.
As to the HT "vulnerability", it really seems to be not a whole lot
different than what people saw with early SMP and (small) direct-mapped
caches. Thank God those days are gone.
I'd be really surprised if somebody is actually able to get a real-world
attack on a real-world pgp key usage or similar out of it (and as to the
covert channel, nobody cares). It's a fairly interesting approach, but
it's certainly neither new nor HT-specific, or necessarily seem all that
worrying in real life.
(HT and modern CPU speeds just means that the covert channel is _faster_
than it has been before, since you can test the L1 at core speeds. I doubt
it helps the key attack much, though, since faster in that case cuts both
ways: the speed of testing the cache eviction may have gone up, but so has
the speed of the operation you're trying to follow, and you'd likely have
a really hard time trying to catch things in real life).
It does show that if you want to hide key operations, you want to be 
careful. I don't think HT is at fault per se.
