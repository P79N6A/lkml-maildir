This suggests that there is some sort of race.
Given that I've never hit it on SMP machines, it is probably a very
small window that opens immediately after some event that triggers
kernel preemption.
The only "mdadm --monitor" does in the kernel is read /proc/mdstat and
maybe make some GET_ARRAY_INFO/ GET_DISK_INFO ioctl calls.
They don't do much more than grab the reconfig_mutex.....
What sort of hardware do you have?  x86?  SMP or uni-processor?
Also, exactly what kernel are you running?
I might see if I can reproduce it... so if you can send me the broken
.config, that might help too.
Thanks,
