Thanks, applied...  (by the way, this bug just results in an
extraneous CONFIG variable being defined, right?  There's no further
breakage -- or am I misunderstanding the situation?)

Actually this option just controls whether to build the debugging
output at all.  The output is controlled at runtime with a module
parameter (which can be changed via sysfs after the module is loaded),
and the output defaults to off.
The reason why I want building the debugging stuff to default to y is
so that distros automatically build modules with debugging enabled.
Otherwise it's a pain to try and gather info from someone who has
problems with a kernel they didn't build.
Thanks,
  Roland
