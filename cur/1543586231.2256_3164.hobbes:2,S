There is no specific kernel option apart configuring the NCR53C8XX and/or
the SYM53C8XX driver. (And not the 53c7,8xx driver as I have to repeat
since 5 years).
For the 53c1510D, you must ensure that the chip is configured for behaving
as a 53c8xx chip (and not as an intelligent controller).
To know about the 1510 configuration, you may check the PCI device id
claimed by the chip. Value 0xa is the expected value if the chip is
configured for 53c8xx mode.
Btw, I donnot know how to change the 1510 from intelligent mode to 53c8xx
mode and vice-versa. You may ask your vendor for that.
