I think there is an error in do_signal():
       default:
            lock_kernel();
            sigaddset(&current->signal, signr);
            recalc_sigpending(current);
            current->flags |= PF_SIGNALED;
            do_exit(exit_code);
            /* NOTREACHED */
      }
I haven't checked the details of the signal delivery, but it seems that
the lock_kernel() is superflous, and
spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock) is missing:
       default:
            spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
            sigaddset(&current->signal, signr);
            recalc_sigpending(current);
	    spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
            current->flags |= PF_SIGNALED;
            do_exit(exit_code);
            /* NOTREACHED */
      }
