Subject: 2.4.8-ac6 ad1848 module failed at init
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

In kernel 2.4.8-ac6, with
# CONFIG_PNP is not set
# CONFIG_ISAPNP is not set
# CONFIG_PNPBIOS is not set
CONFIG_SOUND=y
CONFIG_SOUND_OSS=m
CONFIG_SOUND_TRACEINIT=y
CONFIG_SOUND_DMAP=y
CONFIG_SOUND_TRIX=m
CONFIG_SOUND_SB=m
CONFIG_SOUND_YM3812=m
module ad1848 built but failed at init with "No device found."
I reverted, by copying ad1848.c from the -ac4 tree, and the resulting
module loaded successfully, and seems to be functioning correctly.
