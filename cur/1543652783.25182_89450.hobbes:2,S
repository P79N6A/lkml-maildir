This is not the problem with MAP_SHARED.  It is the lack of  (arch 
specific) hugepage aligned function support in the kernel. You can use 
the mmap on hugetlbfs using only MAP_FIXED with properly aligned 
addresses (but then this also is only a hint to kernel).  With addr == 
 NULL in mmap, the function is bound to fail almost all the times.
Thanks Ben for letting me know the problem with previous post.
