0.5% of what? This is part of what is needed to implement support for
multiple swap devices. You could extend what you already have,
implementing bitmaps that require a bit for every page of swap the user
has swapon'd, but that doesn't seem efficient to me.

It may do, but swap.c certainly doesn't. It supports exactly one device.
