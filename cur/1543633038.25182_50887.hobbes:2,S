Just a minor nit: for ia64 it's either 32KB (for page sizes up to
16KB) or 64KB (for 64KB page size).  The 32KB is conservative and
based on the assumption that there can be up to 16 nested interrupts
plus some other nested traps (such as unaligned faults).  A separate
irq stack should let us reduce the per-task stack size.
