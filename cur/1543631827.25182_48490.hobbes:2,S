Subject: [patch 5/18] mark swapout pages PageWriteback()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Pages which are under writeout to swap are locked, and not
PageWriteback().  So page allocators do not throttle against them in
shrink_caches().
This causes enormous list scans and general coma under really heavy
swapout loads.
One fix would be to teach shrink_cache() to wait on PG_locked for swap
pages.  The other approach is to set both PG_locked and PG_writeback
for swap pages so they can be handled in the same manner as file-backed
pages in shrink_cache().
This patch takes the latter approach.
