There seems to be a usb printer problem in 2.6.16-rc1 (amd64)
I can print a page or two of graphichs (A4 maps), and then 
my syslog fills up with these:
kernel: drivers/usb/class/usblp.c: usblp0: error -19 reading printer status
It is then time to power-cycle the printer, restart cups and
maybe get another page out.  Or maybe not. Going back to 2.6.15 I don't
see such problems, the printer cranks out page after page with ease.
Known issue, or is some USB debugging in place?
