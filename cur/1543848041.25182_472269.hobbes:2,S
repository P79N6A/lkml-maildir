	We're discussing it both online and offline because there are
concerns they have that do need to be addressed.
	What's not to like?  If you need more than 4K to display an
attribute, odds are you have more than one attribute in the file, which
is Wrong.  These guys, it turns out, don't, which is why I'm trying to
help them.  But I don't want to encourage others to do the wrong thing.
	I'm also unhappy with the lack of symmetry this creates on the
store/show() prototypes.  We're discussing whether the store() side
should support larger-than-a-page writes, and how to do it.
