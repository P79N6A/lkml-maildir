 claims that ICH6 doesn't 
support hotswap. The Intel docs seem to say the same thing. Pulling the 
drive out generates an ACPI interrupt but not a PCI one. I'm really 
happy to be wrong here, it's just that everything I've been able to find 
so far suggests that ACPI is the only way to get a notification that the 
drive has gone missing :)
