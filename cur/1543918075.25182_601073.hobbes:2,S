The easiest way to do that would be to first merge all the queued and
collected patches from the last months. Once they are in people
can then create whatever mess they like.
The other way round  (adapting 100+ patches to a possibly completely
different tree) will be a huge amount of work which I am
frankly not very motivated to do because I think it's quite unnecessary. 
I would probably just push the work back to all the patch submitters -- that is 
what I meant with dropping the patches.
I assume mess up first would be also a minor catastrophe for Andrew --
in addition to my patches he also has a large number of patches
touching {x86_64,i386}
