Yes. We are getting a bit away from disk geometries, but it is true
that there are many broken BIOSes that in some way depend on partition
table format or MBR format.
I recall the report that one BIOS tuned IDE modes by reading the MBR
and seeing whether it ended with 0xaa55. If not it tried a lower speed.
So on a disk without this MBR signature, the I/O would be slow.
BSD used to use an entirely different partition table scheme.
And it was not uncommon to run a whole-disk BSD system, without
any partitioning.
Increasingly often that caused problems with broken BIOSes
that wanted to interpret partition table contents.
The categories of problems that come to mind are:
- BIOS has a virus detection option and checks the MBR
- BIOS inspects the partition table to find the hibernation partition
- BIOS inspects the partition table to find the service partition
- BIOS inspects the partition table to guess what geometry it should report
I recall that certain Thinkpads would not boot FreeBSD even with a DOS-type
partition table because the BIOS did not like the a5 partition ID.
So, yes, you are right, practice is much more complicated than theory.
