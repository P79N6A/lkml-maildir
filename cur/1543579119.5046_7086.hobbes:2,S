The underlying problem is of course that all those sanity checks should
be done in user space, not in the kernel.
(See also 
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/slides/tmp-tc.ps.gz
The bitching starts on slide 11, some ideas for fixing the problem on
slide 16, but heed the warning on slide 15.)
Besides that, I agree that we have far too many EINVALs in the kernel.
Maybe we should just record file name and line number of the EINVAL
in *current and add an eh?(2) system call ;-)
