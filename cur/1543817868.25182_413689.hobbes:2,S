Consider systems based on the "Sossaman" Xeon LV processor; it has good 
integer performance and low power.
For example, at IBM we just released a new model of the BladeCenter HS20 
(model 7981); I've seen one of these servers using only 100W when 
running. Real servers are never going to be as cheap as the cheapest 
whiteboxes, but they do run cool.
