I don't think this has anything to do with preempt.  The current task
was not preemptible (hence the error notice on exit - is that why you
blame preempt?).  There is also no preempt_schedule call in your back
trace.
Looks to me like you died coming off an IDE interrupt and a resulting
read - you ran out of free pages and bit the dust there.  Dunno why,
though.  I don't have an mm_inline.h:78 in my tree, but I do have a
DEBUG_LRU near it ...
