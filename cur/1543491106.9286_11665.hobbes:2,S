	Any plans to include the devfs patch from Richard Gooch into the 
stable or unstable kernel tree?
	I think that it is a good way to solve all the problems that 
appear when using too many devices, and automatic major and minor numbers 
is a very interesting thing.
	I have been using it for almost three months, and have no problem 
with it,and since january I'm running an all-devfs system (I have too 
much spare time to spend patching and recompiling :-).
