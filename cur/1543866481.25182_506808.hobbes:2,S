well the same people had to change for the request_irq prototype change
etc etc.
I suppose they'll all get fixed if some distro does this cleanup
anyway... otherwise no amount of deprecation will get things changed;
unless the compile actually breaks nobody will pay attention.
Also quite a few external drivers that are aiming for mainline inclusion
should already be using the new settings for a while anyway...
Another option is to back out the change again totally; having 2
constants for the same thing is just a bad idea, and old users will keep
sneaking in.
