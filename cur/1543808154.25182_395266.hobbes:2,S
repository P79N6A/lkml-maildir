Subject: Linux running on a PCI Option device?

Hello,
I am working on a new board that will have Linux running on an xscale 
processor. This board will be a PCI Option device. I currently have a IXDP465 
eval board which has a PCI Option connector that I will use for prototyping. 
From what I can tell so far, Linux wants to scan the PCI bus for devices as 
if it is the PCI host. Is there any provision in Linux so that it can take on 
the role of a PCI option rather than a PCI host?
Jon
