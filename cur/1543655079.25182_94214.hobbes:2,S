Hi Dave
Yes, their software its pretty cool and its the only choice for using some
of the features of the DAC960 (ex. MORE, setting queue tag len for single
hdd, write-back cache for logical and physical drives, very nice event
viewer, full SNMP variables exporting). They provide native linux
drivers/server and win32 client (inside a rpm and using wine to start
itself). Except for some minor visual problems the GAM client works pretty
well with wine.
I sugest you to try it out.
