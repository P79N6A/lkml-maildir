Would it help if I added instrumentation code to both the upstream code and 
the stripped down code in question?

Any suggestions for tests I could add to the boilerplate I've been using to 
benchmark the code? I'll add a few tests that use random input rather than 
one of the source files - I'd add a test to see how it deals with NULL input, 
but I ran into that in an early version of the testbed (where I had a typo 
that stopped the code from working) and the compressor didn't like it. And I 
suppose I could put in a test that reads in a chunk of /dev/mem or have it 
get a chunk of data from HAL/DBus as well.
But if anyone has a suggestion of what tests I could toss at it to really 
stress the code, let me know and I'll get to work extending this code so it 
can stress test both the standard implementation of miniLZO *and* this 
stripped down 'Tiny' version.
