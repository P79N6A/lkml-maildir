I'm  sorry. Oops was take place not after _eject_ CF, but after _disconnect_ 
USB CF reader/writer...
I wrote small script, which demonstrate described problem...
------- test-usb-storage.sh -----------
#!/bin/bash
SCSI_DEVICE=/dev/sda1
MOUNT_POINT=/mnt
IS_USB_STORAGE_DEVICE_UP=`cat /proc/bus/usb/devices | grep Driver=usb-storage`
IS_MOUNT=`mount | grep $MOUNT_POINT`
if [ "$IS_MOUNT" != "" ]
then
 echo "$MOUNT_POINT mark as already mounted ..."
 echo  $IS_MOUNT
 exit
fi
if [ "$IS_USB_STORAGE_DEVICE_UP" = "" ]
then
 echo "USB storage device not found ..."
 exit
fi
mount $SCSI_DEVICE -t auto $MOUNT_POINT -o user
if [ $? != 0 ]
then
 echo "Can't mount $SCSI_DEVICE";
 exit
fi
echo Disconnect USB storage device now...
while [ "$IS_USB_STORAGE_DEVICE_UP" != "" ]
do
sleep 1
IS_USB_STORAGE_DEVICE_UP=`cat /proc/bus/usb/devices | grep Driver=usb-storage`
done
umount $MOUNT_POINT
echo $?k !
