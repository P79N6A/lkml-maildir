This looks like a usb device was unplugged and plugged back in.
What devices do you have connected?
What host controller driver are you using?
What happens to the machine at this time of night (cron jobs, etc.)?
What is your .config?
What kernel is this (and if 2.4.0-test10, does this also happen on
2.4.0-test12-pre4)?
What kind of processor is this?
In short, lots more info needed.
thanks,
greg k-h
