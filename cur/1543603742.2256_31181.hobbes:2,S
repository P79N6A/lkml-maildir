I see also that in that function:
--------------------------------------------------------
static void __init sbf_bootup(void)
{
	u8 v = sbf_read();
	if(!sbf_value_valid(v))
		v = 0;
#if defined(CONFIG_PNPBIOS)
	/* Tell the BIOS to fast init as we are a PnP OS */
	v |= (1<<0);	/* Set PNPOS flag */
#endif
	sbf_write(v);
}
--------------------------------------------------------
there is a parity check (in the sbf_value_valid function)
prior to changing one of the bits, but there is no check to make
sure that the parity is still correct after the "PNPOS" flag
has been set.  Is this okay?  Or am I confused about something?
