That's a ridiculous statement.  Just because you didn't bother, you
can't assume that the people who were actually affected didn't bother.
I went through large parts of the 1990's under the name "David
K}gedal". And I bothered.
And no, the second character in my last name is not an accented a,
they have been separate letters for hundreds of years in Sweden.  So I
can live without using accented letters, as long as I can write
Kågedal including the å. :-)
Not that my name appears anywhere in the Linux source, but I still
felt the urge to reply...
