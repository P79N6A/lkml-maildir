Well I tested Reiser4 on systems building our Linux flavour (based on the T2 
framework) thus with excessive software compilation, a lot of tarball 
extraction, compilation of fat packages such as linux, mozilla, openoffice 
et.al. and huge per-package ccache directories -> zilions of small files and 
did not encounter any abnormal behaviour aside the yet-to-be-fixed commit 
storms. Performance was superiour over ext3, XFS*, JFS or Reiser3 in this 
workload (that is less time "wasted" for FS housekeeping and the build 
finished noticable earlier). Patchset was tested around 2.6.1{4,5]. But I do 
not have the numbers around anymore and was basically waiting for Reiser4 to 
make it into the kernel to schedule further testing.
You can see I'm not a blind Reiser4 follower but would rather like to see a 
fair chance for it.
*) XFS oopsed so often in this test that I'll never touch it again ...
Yours,
