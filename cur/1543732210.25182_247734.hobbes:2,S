Roman Zippel changed the threading stuff on m68k. Since it would affect other
architectures, I never submitted it on my own.
In short, we never really compile this code, since the m68k tree doesn't use it
anymore. And yes, it even fails with older compiler versions, like 2.95.2.

I'll make sure a plain kernel.org kernel can build an m68k kernel.

Great!
Let's hope people start doing the other way around as well, so I don't have to
run allyesconfigs to catch bugs in non-m68k drivers ;-)
