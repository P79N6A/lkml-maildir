btw., if the best answer is: "do not enable b43 and bcm43xx at once in 
the .config because we messed up the dependencies and fixing it in 
2.6.24-stable is unfortunately too risky", then that's a perfectly fine 
answer for -stable. Then the fix would be to exclude each other in the 
Kconfig space (which is not risky). But just ignoring bugreports and 
NAK-ing a fix is not a valid answer.
