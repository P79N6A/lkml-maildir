One has to wonder how he got FC3 to boot without the new module tools,
given that it's a 2.6 kernel with everything and its pet monkey built
as modules.  Getting FC3 *installed* without them requires some rather
interesting abuse of the 'rpm' command or other similar stunts, and the
resulting system will spew tons of 'QM_MODULE' errors while booting.
His problems almost certainly lie elsewhere.
