At least it used to be that a "return whatever;" generated a lot of code,
so in order to save that this construction is used in some places. Similar
stuff is used to keep little-used code out of line, where it won't fill up
the cache.
It is wise to check the compiler output if you don't understand what is
going on. In this case, write a small test proggie and compile with
-S. Note that the results _will_ vary wildly from gcc-2.7.2.3 to
egcs-1.1.6, and even more so compared against latest egcs snapshots, so you
might be seeing ancient history/backward compatibility in some places.
Perhaps some of it should be cleaned up.
