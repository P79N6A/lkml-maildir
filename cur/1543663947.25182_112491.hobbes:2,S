Linus, all
	In my exuberance to remove #ifdef CONFIG_X86_TSC, I accidentally yanked
one that is needed as long as the symbol itself exists. I've actually
been sitting on this patch for a while, thinking I would get around to
killing off the remaining uses of _X86_TSC, but I've just been too
swamped to get around to it.
This patch ensures that the "notsc" boot parameter is ignored (with a
warning) if the option is passed to a kernel that has been compiled with
CONFIG_X86_TSC. Currently the code will unreasonably panic when this
occurs. 
And since this patch does add an #ifdef _X86_TSC, as a show of goodwill,
I'll follow this patch with another that removes one instance of
_X86_TSC. 
Please apply,
thanks

PS: If anyone is looking for a little project, the usage in pkt_sched.h
and profile.h (include/net) could use some attention :)
