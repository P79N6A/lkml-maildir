This patch appears to be against some private tree of yours, not against -mm.
Which tells me that it hasn't been tested against the patches in -mm and,
more importantly, that probably nobody is testing the patches which are
in -mm.
I'd prefer that you do so, please - there's always a possibility that the 
patches got mangled in flight, or that some other pending change in -mm
means that the patches work in your tree, but won't work when I merge them
up.
Thanks.
