Haven't looked at the scheduler code yet, but for a similar problem I use 
a time ring. The ring has Ns (2 power is better) slots (where tasks are 
queued - in my case they were som sort of timers), and it has a current 
base index (Ib), a current base time (Tb) and a time granularity (Tg). It 
also has a bitmap with bits telling you which slots contains queued tasks. 
An item (task) that has to be scheduled at time T, will be queued in the slot:
S = Ib + min((T - Tb) / Tg, Ns - 1);
Items with T longer than Ns*Tg will be scheduled in the relative last slot 
(chosing a proper Ns and Tg can minimize this).
Queueing is O(1) and de-queueing is O(Ns). You can play with Ns and Tg to 
suite to your needs.
This is a simple bench between time-ring (TR) and CFS queueing:

In my box (Dual Opteron 252):
davide@alien:~$ ./smart-queue -n 8            
CFS = 142.21 cycles/loop
TR  = 72.33 cycles/loop
davide@alien:~$ ./smart-queue -n 16
CFS = 188.74 cycles/loop
TR  = 83.79 cycles/loop
davide@alien:~$ ./smart-queue -n 32
CFS = 221.36 cycles/loop
TR  = 75.93 cycles/loop
davide@alien:~$ ./smart-queue -n 64
CFS = 242.89 cycles/loop
TR  = 81.29 cycles/loop
