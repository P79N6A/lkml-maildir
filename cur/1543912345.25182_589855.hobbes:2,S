Why am I getting this when I do:
git clone
http://master.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jwessel/linux-2.6-kgdb.git

error: Couldn't get

for tags/v2.6.11
The requested URL returned error: 404
error: Could not interpret tags/v2.6.11 as something to pull

We are getting a problem with VMware where kernel text is the schedler
is getting wacked with four null bytes into the code. Thought I'd use
the current linux-2.6-kgdb.git tree and possible the CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA
patch to make kernel text readonly:
 
https://www.x86-64.org/pipermail/patches/2007-March/003666.html
I thought the kernel text was RO and gdb had to disable it to
insert a breakpoint.
