Actually, it should give a SIGSEGV for the first byte allocated, 
although I agree that it might not work for any other byte allocated in 
the case where malloc returns a pointer just at the end of a page.
I just tested the sample code and in fact I do get a SIGSEGV.
What kernel version / architecture are you testing this on?
