Thank you for your reply and for the information.
Any reason to be disturbed by the fact /proc/interrupts only shows 
CPU0 with irq counts while CPU1 is always zero?
All the VIA chipsets I have that are SMP report both CPU's in the 
interrupt counts.  This IWILL board with the I860 chipset does not 
no matter which kernel I try.
I'd like to fix this but I dont know how.  But I  am willing to 
assist and devote any time necessary to someone who may have the 
knowledge fix it.  There have to be others out there experiencing 
this same issue so its not a wasted cause in my estimation.  
Alan, do you have any commentary on this issue?
Cheers
Ron
