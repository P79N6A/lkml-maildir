Andi.
Please spend even just a few minutes looking at the old i386 code.

Here's what the old code did:
	frameptr = initialize frame code
	while (1) {
		struct thread_info *context;
		context = (struct thread_info *)
			((unsigned long)stack & (~(THREAD_SIZE - 1)));
		frameptr = print_context_stack(context, stack, frameptr, log_lvl);
		stack = (unsigned long*)context->previous_esp;
		if (!stack)
			break;
		printk(" =======================\n");
	}
it it really was that simple. The actual frame-following code was in 
"print_context_stack()", and it works entirely within a single stack page, 
and returns once it is outside that stack page. 
There is absolutely ZERO problem with new pages through interrupt stacks 
etc, because we don't even trust the stack contents for that, we just 
follow the stack context pointers that we _can_ trust.
