Ok - apologies for my needless rant in your direction. I guess I also just
felt bad for not upgrading my kernel in 450 days of uptime, if I did that, I
would not have been rooted in the first place.
Will try to avenge all this by implementing a nice LSM module for preventing
such malware from being able to deploy too easily :-)
