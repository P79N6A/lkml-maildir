Let me throw in a final $.02...
Are you sure your 9GB and 18GB drives are of the same "generation" of
technology?  SCSI drive platters have gotten smaller and smaller to
shorten the seek distance (they use 2.5" media now inside 3.5" drives)
for random operations, and I'm wondering if your 18GB is in fact a
generation ahead of your 9GB.
Are you sure your 9GB SCSI drive only has 1 platter in it?
