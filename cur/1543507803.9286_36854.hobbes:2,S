Shure, it does! But Distributions like Redhat are already shipping them
anyway. If you get a 2.2.x Kernel from kernel.org running on a Redhat 6.0
Basesystem. NFS will no longer work :(
As a dayly user of a Linux cluster based on diskless clients I would like to
have H.J.'s patches in the Mainstream Kernel. The actual state of stock knfs
is next to unusable, especially because I need NFS connections to other
UNIXoid Systems like Solaris as well.
Speed is not that important though, all I need is a working NFS
implementation without going trough the hazzle to have to patch stock
Kernels to make the whole Stuff working. 
Regards
Sven
