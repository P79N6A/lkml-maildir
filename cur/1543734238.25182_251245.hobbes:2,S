This arises solely because the DRM and framebuffer drivers cannot find
each other and have no shared structures. The moment you have that it
becomes
	down(&dev->foo->pll_lock);

You are making a generic assumption for a single card specific problem
in a specific situation. That leads to bad decisions for embedded. It
does argue for mode setting and fb to be separate too.
(Remember for most embedded devices mode setting code is trivial)
