I'll have a look out for the results, they should be around somewhere?
The work I did was based on the idea it _had_ to be more efficient to 
have pre-zero'd pages available instead of wasting the hot pages, 
scrubbing them on use.  I did a lot of work to introduce a new queue for 
these, per-cpu.  Scrubbing them using spare cycles, even trying a 
version where we didn't polute the cache with them using uncached 
write-combining.  The results all showed (on i386 machines at least) 
that the predominant cost was cache warmth.  It was slower to fetch the 
clean zero page from memory than it was to clean out all of the cache 
page for use.  The colder the page the slower the system went.
