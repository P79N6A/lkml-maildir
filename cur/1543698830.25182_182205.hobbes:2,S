Linus, your explanation of the whole copyright law and licenses is 
probably the best non-technical (ie non lawyer) explanation I have ever 
read. You guys over at OSDL must have a few good lawyers at your 
disposal :) Thank you very much for your input. Maybe someone should 
post a flow diagram, some use cases or something similarly programmish 
so the non english speaking of us can understand it better. 
libcopyright.so / liblicense.so / libcontract.so anyone? :)
