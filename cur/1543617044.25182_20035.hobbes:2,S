I think we can add it automatically, modifing one of the
the modules macros. (this works automatically only for
trit symbols).
Hmm. IIRC there is a  big module/driver API (for modules) change
in 2.5 programs (driver registration,...). In this case we should
only modify the API before it will be effectivelly used, and
the changes will go automatically in kernel...
