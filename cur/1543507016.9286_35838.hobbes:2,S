So that means it's likely a kernel code difficulty if an frame buffer
console on an i386 (well, K6) wraps the end of a long line back on
to the beginning of the same line, rather than providing a next line?
(atyfb, from the 2.2.12pre8 release most recently, but it's been doing
this since I started using frame buffer consoles.  Everything else
seems to work fine, although getting atyfb to go to 800x600 resolution
by passing boot time paramaters was frustrating enough that I tweaked
the compiled in defaults instead.)
