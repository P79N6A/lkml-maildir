What I would like to see is a generic way for stuff to be included in
the kernel image and loaded at boot time, but then saved out somewhere
and discarded from kernel memory.  Or make some kernel memory swapable.
This could be used for adding configuration info easily.
It could also be used to keep the modules for a kernel with that kernel
image.  The modules could be tacked on the end of the image after it is
compiled.  Then that memory could be made swapable, or be readable
through a special interface.  A user mode program could read the modules
and write them to the disk and then tell the kernel it can discard them.
With a boot-time command line option to the kernel to just toss those
sections, this wouldn't take extra memory.
The System.map file could also be appended in the same way.
I think a general method to add things to the kernel image and get them
back after booting that image would be useful for many different things.
