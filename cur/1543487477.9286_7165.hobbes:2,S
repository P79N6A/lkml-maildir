In earlier discussions you've expressed a distaste for the xdelta file
format, but now you can't justify it anymore.  Can you comment on this?
It seems like you've changed your operational model.
You begin by saying that you want context diffs, but that now you intend
to use diff -n for transmission.  That's because (I suspect) you can't 
guarantee a patch's idempotency with contextual information.  You can't 
guarantee much with only a patch, but since you also record a patch's parent
version the diff format is unimportant.  The remainder of your posting
was off the original topic, as far as I can tell.  Is it now your position
that any diff format is acceptable for transmission, so long as the user 
can view diffs in any format they like?
