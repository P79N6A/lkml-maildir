If the rel_len overflow patch isn't going to make it, then we also need
to revert the EXT*_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE change to 65536.  It would be possible
to allow this to be up to 32768 w/o the rec_len overflow fix however.
Yes, this does imply that those patches were in the wrong order in the
patch series, and I apologize for that, even if it isn't my fault.
Cheers, Andreas
