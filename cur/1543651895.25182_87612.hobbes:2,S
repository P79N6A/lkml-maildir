Thanks. Of course it leaves out various bits, I just put in what I 
thought was interesting. But otherwise you can't see anything easily
anyway.

Mmmm .... not sure ... that'll need some more thought.
For now I did:
---------------------
BOOT CPU:
init
	smp_prepare_cpus
		smp_boot_cpus
			setup_local_APIC
			foreach cpu
				do_boot_cpu
					wakeup_secondary_via_(NMI|INIT)
					{set bit in cpu_callout_map}
					{spin on cpu_callin_map}
			setup_IO_APIC
			synchronize_tsc_bp
	smp_init
		foreach cpu 
			cpu_up
				notifier_call_chain(CPU_UP_PREPARE)
				__cpu_up
					{set bit in smp_commenced_mask}
					{spin on cpu_online_map}
+					local_irq_enable
				notifier_call_chain(CPU_ONLINE)
		smp_cpus_done
		smp_commence
------------------------
SECONDARY CPU:
start_secondary
	cpu_init
	smp_callin
		{spin on cpu_callout_map}
		setup_local_APIC
		local_irq_enable
		calibrate_delay
		disable_APIC_timer
+		local_irq_disable
		{set our bit in cpu_callin_map}
		synchronise_tsc_api	
	{spin on smp_commenced_mask}
	enable_APIC_timer
	{set our bit in cpu_online_map}
	idle
Which seems to work, and is similar to what James did, I think.

Not sure that's any less ugly than the above ;-) I prefer your
idea of moving calibrate_delay, I'll try that sometime soonish,
but need to stare at what uses the result for a while first.
