I mean more along the lines of what does a man-page say the kernel
should be doing if you request a negative timeout? More explicitly,
what made you think negative timeouts should have a specific effect?
When you say schedule_timeout() returns immediately, I assume your
logs are filling up with "schedule_timeout: wrong timeout ..." ? (You
may need to bump your loglevel). If not, then schedule_timeout() isn't
getting a negative value.
Thanks,
