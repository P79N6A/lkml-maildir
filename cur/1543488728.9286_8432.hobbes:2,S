Here is my /proc/cpuinfo from before the patch. There was no change
when I applied the patch (except for some minor variations in the CPU MHz
field). I tried the patch both as a module and built-in. 
processor	: 0
vendor_id	: AuthenticAMD
cpu family	: 5
model		: 8
model name	: AMD-K6(tm) 3D processor
stepping	: 0
cpu MHz		: 350.803419
fdiv_bug	: no
hlt_bug		: no
sep_bug		: no
f00f_bug	: no
fpu		: yes
fpu_exception	: yes
cpuid level	: 1
wp		: yes
flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 sep mmx 3dnow
bogomips	: 699.60
Note that at bootup I got:
