Hello -
I'm seeing file content change without a change to the mtime for that
file, and I'm trying to understand why. 
The filesystem is ext3, on a local IDE drive. It's a Centos 4.3 machine,
with kernel version:  2.6.9-34.0.1.ELsmp
A shell script that in a loop prints the date, stats the file, and then runs 
'md5sum' gave me this output:

So something else read the file at 4:04:51, and apparently changed it. 
I know that mtime can be reset, and that may very well be what's going on.
If that's the case, is there any other way I can from the file metadata
that it may have changed, short of reading it and checksumming? There are 
other files that appear to be changing without updating their mtimes - a
number of the kde screensavers, which I think might be the prelinker.
My end goal is to be able to determine when a file has changed without 
reading the contents, because I want to read the contents and compare them
to a previous version. If the content I read is not the same as the content
I read last time, I want to know if it's intentional or if there has been
some file corruption. (I am not worried about malicious users changing files
and hiding their tracks). The way I had hoped to go was to use the mtime
and filesize, but that appears not to be enough.
Thanks!
