Upgraded my home desktop to 2.6.0. 
Somewhere between 2.5.63 and 2.6.0, sound got screwed up - I've confirmed
this happens on mainline, as well as -mjb.
If I leave xmms playing (in random shuffle mode) every 2 minutes or so,
I'll get some wierd effect for a few seconds, either static, or the track 
will mysteriously speed up or slow down. Then all is back to normal for 
another couple of minutes.
Anyone else seen this, or got any clues? Else I guess I'm stuck playing
bisection search.
