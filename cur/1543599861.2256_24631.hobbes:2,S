Subject: [Q] [VFS] NULL f_dentry for opened files ; possible race condition

Hello,
In 2.4.9, I have encountered a strange condition while playing with file
structs chained on a superblock list (sb->s_files) : some of them can have
a NULL f_dentry pointer. The only case I found which can cause this is
when fput is called and f_count drops to zero. Is that the only case ?
While exploring the corresponding code for an explanation, I found what
looks like a possible race condition : do_remount_sb calls
fs_may_remount_ro, and only then uses lock_super to do the actual remount.
Isn't it possible for a program to open a file for writing just after
fs_may_remount_ro ? The whole thing seems to be protected by the BKL and
mount_sem, but I guess it won't stop an open.
Regards,
