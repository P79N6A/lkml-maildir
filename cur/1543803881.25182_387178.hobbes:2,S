Important is what is important for all members of an "independent" group.
We already have a small example: kerneltraffic. Though it's just one person 
and therefore possibly biased, the magazine picks out what's [deemed] 
important.
Typos don't really advance to important IMO, even if they fix oopses (e.g. 
a missing ! somewhere). More important are world news, news that Joe 
Default User thinks is good - "full double preemption", "O(0.5) scheduler" 
and other illusory things. Just think of if you had to commercially sell 
a Linux kernel CD what features you would print on the cover.
As for me, it was important to see SCHED_BATCH going in, as I started 
to look through the big changelog :)
Well, my 2 euros. (Yeah, 200 cents!)
