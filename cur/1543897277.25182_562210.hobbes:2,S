If your only purpose is to try generate a defensive patent, then just
dumping the idea in the public domain serves the same purpose, probably
better.
I have a few patents, some of which are defensive. That has not prevented
the USPTO issuing quite a few patents that are in clear violation of mine.
A defensive patent clearly did not prevent these patents from being
issued. A defensive patent might make it slightly easier to protect
yourself should one of the later patents try flex their muscle, but an
idea that is well articulated in a public forum should be sufficient
protection too.
AINAL and all that...
