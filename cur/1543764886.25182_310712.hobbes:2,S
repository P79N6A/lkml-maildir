Software continues to evolve.  The copyright owners can relicense the
code base under v3, and use v3 for all subsequent changes to the
software.  The trouble with relicensing is that you have to contact
all copyright holders (or remove their code).  This tends to be
impossible in long-running projects without contractual agreements
between the developers.
