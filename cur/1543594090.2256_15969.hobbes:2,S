I use the reverse approach. you feed work to the threads, I create the threads
and let them ask for work to a master until it says 'done'. When the
master is queried for work, it locks a mutex, decide the next work for
that thread, and unlocks it. I think it gives the lesser contention and
is simpler to manage.
