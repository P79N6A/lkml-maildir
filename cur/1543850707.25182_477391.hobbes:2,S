Yes, I thought it too. Probably, author thought passed pages's owner
is readpages side, and owner can use that list with favorite way.
Well, both seems right things for me. So, the patch was done by
minimum change for -rc. If you want it, I'll do.
BTW, umm.. now I think, gfs2_readpages() seems to have a bug in error
path by different way. unlock_page() is really needed?
