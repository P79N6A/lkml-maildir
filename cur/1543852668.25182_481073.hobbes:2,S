I ran majority of micro-benchmarks from LKP project with global load
balance tasklet. (

)
Result is here:
http://kernel-perf.sourceforge.net/sched/global-load-bal.txt
All results are within noise range.  The global tasklet does a fairly good job especially on context switch intensive workload like
aim7, volanomark, tbench
etc.  Note all machines are non-numa platform.
Base on the data, I think we should make the load balance tasklet one per numa
node instead of one per CPU.
