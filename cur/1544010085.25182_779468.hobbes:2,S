Sorry, I don't see such tools with, for instance, a possibility to be 
compiled out in non-debug builds.
 From one side, I can agree, those TRACE_ENTRY()/TRACE_EXIT() statements 
*may* look like a noise (I personally don't notice them), but, from 
other side, in past times they have proved how usable they are. If an 
SCST user has a problem, I simply ask him to make a debug build, then 
enable entry_exit and some other logging levels, then reproduce the 
problem and send me the logs. Then in most cases I can see what's wrong 
and provide a fix without additional actions and questions.

They are documented, near their prototypes in the public header files, 
particularly, scst.h. It was done so, because it was supposed that one, 
writing a target driver or dev handler will have on hands the header 
files, not source code.
Should we move those comments from the functions prototypes to the 
functions definitions?

We will try.
