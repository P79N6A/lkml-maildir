thanks, applied.

will keep an eye on it.
How far away are you from unifying fault_32.c and fault_64.c? You 
already managed to line up their sizes:
$ wc -l arch/x86/mm/fault_*.c
  742 arch/x86/mm/fault_32.c
  734 arch/x86/mm/fault_64.c
;-)
and the raw diff between them doesnt look that bad either:
 1 file changed, 127 insertions(+), 135 deletions(-)
so we might as well take a shot at that?
