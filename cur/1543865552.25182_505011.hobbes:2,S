Agreed, definitely. A libpcl (using swapcontext(3)) cobench is about 50 
times faster than an context switch measured by lmbench (although I have 
serious doubts about about the ability of lat_ctx to measure it - but 
that's another story) on an Opteron 254. One may say "Wow! Really?!?".
The point is, who cares. We are talking about differences between 
super-fast (~2us) and ultra-fast (~0.04us).
The time (and code) that you'll have to drop in the syscall path to handle 
M:N is very likely to make you lose way more of what you gain by avoiding 
an OS context switch (a "soft" context switch you still have to do it).
Either use N:N (requires locking, but spread over multiple CPUs) or 1:N 
(I/O driven state machines or coroutines - no locking, once-CPU bound).
