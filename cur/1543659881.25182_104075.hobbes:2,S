Hi James,
The 2.5.59 version of the rivafb driver has some strange effects on my screen.
The leftmost ~5 pixels of each line are displaced to the right side of the screen,
so that the remainder of the screen is shifted ~5 pixels left, i.e. it's like
the screen has been rotated left a bit. 2.5.58 was alright.
If you've got a patch for this issue, I'll test it.
Regards,
-Udo.
