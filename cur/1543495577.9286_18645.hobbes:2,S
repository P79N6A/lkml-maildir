My i386-irq-SMP race fixes are been included starting from pre-2_2_8-1.
stock-2.2.8 is rock solid too (so go with it).
The only difference between my original patches and the current 2.2.8 code
is that Linus added a separate flag for differentiate the meaning of
IRQ_INPROGRESS and IRQ_WAITING-for-probe.
My last version of my fix could cause a silent lockup in the unlikely case
a buggy driver would issue a disable_irq() on a irq happened in the middle
of irq probe (unlikely to happen but...).
Adding an extra bit allowed a cleaner/more-robust design (thanks to Linus ;).
