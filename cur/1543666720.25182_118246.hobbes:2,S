It is maximal delack for generic (transactional) traffic. It is not used
in stream mode. Big clamp of 500msec is hardwired to tcp_send_delayed_ack,
I simply was not able to invent name for it.

It is the place. Session stops to be tranasaction, when we
experience the first delack timeout.

Also correct. Delacks are disabled while recovery periods.

It is set, when we see traffic in both directions. It is cleared
when we see the first delack timeout. Logically, it should be cleared
when we do not see data flowing in opposite direction for some time,
but as soon as we do not see delack timeouts, it does not matter.

If you do not see any delack timeouts, clearing pingpong does not make
difference.

Stop here. quick quickly must become zero. In your case, when window
is one packet, it happens exactly after the first packet.
I am confused. Please, check.

SHOULD, not MUST. :-)
Jokes apart, it is simply wrong statement. Right one reads: "when right
egde of window advanced by at least two segments". It is supposed to provide
ACK clock, but when window stalled, such acks are pure abuse, they are simply
ignored by clocking mechanism.

"eaten" is special path, it happens when this function is subroutine
of tcp_recvmsg(), where the same code is executed upon return
from the function.
