I understand that point.
I just always assumed that kernel tests meant 'please test this patch'
and doing the compile yourself.
But I'm not convinced be the following:

This looks more like a "regular" out-of-tree module for the purpose of
the suggested symbol garbage collector.
And for that case I already a 'don't use it then'-note.
The base problem is that there already are many options to break
external modules. (CONFIG_MODULES=n ;) )
Or in the case of this wireless module: CONFIG_CRYPTO_ARC4=n
(Without 'arc4' ieee80211_wep_init() will fail, that will fail
ieee80211_register_hw() and so no mac80211 driver could be loaded)

The question I can't answer in this context is: Do distributions want
to support external modules?
Only if yes, your argument is valid. But then they could just disable
this feature and prevent this kind of bugreports.
