This is not only X. The problem is the software layering bloat.
Thats a design mistake we copied from W*ndows in our Linux
applications.
Take your favorite - and I mean your favorite, not the easiest -
application, find the handler for the problem event, try to do a
really complete call graph trough all software layers involved
(say from read(inputdevice_fd) to get the event up to
write(outputdevice_fd) to write to the framebuffer) and count
cycles. Don't forget the cache misses due to following pointers,
which lead to random, non-local memory access patterns 
(read: a VM and cache nightmare).
Once you really finish this boring task completely you know our
real performance problem.
Felix von Leitner did a nice presentation on our 
Chemnitzer Linux Tag (but in German) and many experienced
programmers and software enginieers were really stunned.
So the problem is not really the kernel or the X layer. The
NUMBER of abstraction layers is the issue to attack.
People tend to import big bloated libraries or even completely
overkill operating systems just because it has ONE SIMPLE
property the actually need[1]. This must change.
