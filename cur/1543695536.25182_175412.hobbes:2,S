On the heels of my system going nuts when I enabled Highmem I've played
with the ram and starting to wonder if it might all be good and I might
have a CPU just panic'ing for the fun of it.
I'm going to run MEMTEST today when I get home and get a chance to make
a bootable CD but I'm wondering if there might be a "CPUTEST" or such
utility anyone knows of that'll poke and prod a dual athalon real well
and make sure I don't have a flaky cpu.
