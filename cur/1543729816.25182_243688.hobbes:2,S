This is definitely not a "hot" problem so there is absolutely no reason to 
make incompatible changes in the kernel interface _without_ discussing this
with the most important users before.
On a decently administrated Linux system, only root is able to send SCSI 
commands because only root is able to open the apropriate /dev/* entries.
cdrecord is designed to be safely installed root and cdrecord is trustworthy - 
it does not overwrite the drive's firmware.
pxupgrade is not intended to be installed suid root, but _even_ _if_ someone
does, it will not allow you to write a file that has not been verifed to be
valid firmware for the drive in question.

You completely missimterpret importance :-(
Conclusion: What Linux-2.6.8 implement is a bug :-(
