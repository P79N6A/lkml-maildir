Yes I'm sure!
Isn't this number the MAX value ever samplef for "Current # commands on 
controller"?  It doesn't seem to be the counter of how many commands were 
processed since start.
To doublecheck, I're run bonnie one more time.
This one was taken while bonnie was running:
cciss0: HP Smart Array 5i Controller
Board ID: 0x40800e11
Firmware Version: 2.56
IRQ: 18
Logical drives: 1
Current Q depth: 0
Current # commands on controller: 132
Max Q depth since init: 147
Max # commands on controller since init: 190
Max SG entries since init: 31
rereading the file, the only moving number was "Current # commands on 
controller", basically oscillating between 10 and 150.

As you see, after more runs Max Q raised to 147, but I'm sure it was 6 after 
that first run, and in that 1st run responsiveness was already sluggish.
Anyway, I wouldn't focus too much on CCISS, cause the only thing that's 
specific of this hardware is the long delay killing bonnie.  
Bad responsiveness has been found almost everywhere else.
