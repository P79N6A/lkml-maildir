Any PIII with speedstep, any Athlon and PIV.

Fixed in the -ac tree for the non APM triggered case because we use
cpufreq code

And you can test that with notsc. Oh and you might also want the code
that makes notsc on a tsc only kernel print a warning btw. badtsc lets
you say "I have a brain cell" notsc lets you select "clueless app
checking mode"
As to the other issue. As soon as we have plug in tsc handling that can
use ACPI, x86-64, summit and other timer sources I'm very keen to put
the tsc based timer in as a fallback before the PIT, and to do chip
sanity checks on it (matching clockmul, not spudstop etc)
