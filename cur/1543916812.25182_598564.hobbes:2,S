Hi Scott,

I'm still not convinced cpm_uart_cpm1.h is correct:
pinfo->rx_bd_base and pinfo->tx_bd_base are both initialized with an 
address obtained by cpm_dpram_addr(). In both ppc and powerpc, this is 
an address relative to dpram_vbase in commproc.c
In cpm_uart_core.c, the operation "pinfo->rx_bd_base - DPRAM_BASE" is 
used to calculate the DPRAM offset. So DPRAM_BASE must be relative to 
dpram_vbase in commproc.c as well. However, cpm_uart_cpm1.h uses cpmp in 
commproc.c to initialize DPRAM_BASE.
On ARCH=ppc, cpmp is a physical address with 1:1 virtual mapping ("well 
known address"). On ARC=powerpc, this is an address obtained by 
ioremap(), however it's a different ioremap() call than dpram_vbase is 
obtained from, so noone can guarantee
cpmp is always the same as dpram_vbase even on ARCH=powerpc.
To me, it looks like setting DPRAM_BASE to cpm_dpram_addr(0) is the fix 
as it makes the DPRAM offset a defined result.
Thanks,
Jochen
