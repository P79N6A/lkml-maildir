2.5 already seems to be scheduling better for me, although I'm still mostly 
running 2.4 on my new laptop until I figure out how to properly configure all 
the new hardware.  (APM suspends, and then never comes back until you yank 
the #*%(&# battery.  Great.  Trying it with the real mode bios calls next 
reboot...)

I got caught in a downpour with my laptop in my backpack, and didn't realise 
the water resistant coating on my backpack had worn away until I turned the 
thing on and the display shorted out.  After two days of drying out, the 
display was still screwed up, so I just bought a used thinkpad (iseries 1300, 
quite a nice little machine) and swapped the hard drive and some ram from my 
old toshiba.  (Kudzu actually did something useful for once. :)
I think I've figured out why X is giving me an 800x600 window on a 1024x768 
display screen (with a big black border).  Why XFree86 freezes the box solid 
for ten seconds at a time while KDE is probing the hardware devices, that I 
don't know.  (Google suggests the USB is funky.  I'll see if 2.5 fixes it, 
all I know of 2.5 on this box is that it booted to text mode and then shut 
down again ok...)
I'm likely to be a bit distracted for a while yet, not counting catching up, 
being out of town for a weekend, and of course the fall semester starting in 
two weeks.  Luckily, they make caffeine for just such occasions...
