You will need to SetPageReserved(pg) for remap_page_range to map it.
And no, remembering your earlier pleas, the MM system doesn't clean
up for you, you'll need to ClearPageReserved and free the page when
it's all done with (if ever).

virt_to_phys applies to the kernel virtual address (what you name "virt"
above), it won't work on a user virtual address, that's something else.

I'm not a user of remap_page_range (just someone who one day wants
to get rid of PageReserved and incidentally lift that SetPageReserved
restriction), not the best person to advise you.  But there are plenty
of examples of using remap_page_range in the kernel source tree, maybe
not all of them quite correct, but I'd have thought you could work out
what you need from those examples.
