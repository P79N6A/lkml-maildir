I don't understand why this is necessary... Comparing the bug you fixed
in st with ipr's usage of scatterlists, there is a bit of a difference.
st is dealing with user pages and calling page_cache_release to release
the pages, and I can begin to understand why there might be a problem
in that code. page_cache_release looks at the pages themselves to figure
out how many compound pages there are. This could certainly result in
double free's occurring.
Looking at ipr, however, it is simply doing alloc_pages
and __free_pages. __free_pages passes in the page allocation order, so
I don't think I would have the double free problem.
As I understand it, pci_map_sg only modifies the dma_address and dma_length
fields when things get coalesced. If it were to coalese pages by
turning them into compound pages then I would agree that ipr might have
a problem, but I don't think this to be the case...
