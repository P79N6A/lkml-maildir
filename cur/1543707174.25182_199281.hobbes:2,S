Thanks. I'll base my driver on this one as it does seem quite easy
to follow. However I'm wondering what the point of the begin/end functions
are. The dma_read/write functions just seem to call dma_count which starts the
dma requests going.
Am I missing something here? Is all that required from the higher level a single
call to dma_read/write or should I be expecting a series of calls to setup a transfer?

Hmmm, vger seems to be ignoring my subscribe requests. 
Is the list archived anywhere? None are listed on VGER.
