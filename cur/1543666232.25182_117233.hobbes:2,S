Hi all 
I'm not having success compiling 2.5.64-mm6. 
I compile standard linux-2.5.64 but after applying 2.5.64-mm6
I get this 
init/main.c:48:23: linux/gdb.h: No such file or directory
init/main.c: In function `start_kernel':
init/main.c:457: `gdb_enter' undeclared (first use in this function)
init/main.c:457: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
init/main.c:457: for each function it appears in.)
init/main.c:458: warning: implicit declaration of function `gdb_hook'
Also make clean gives me this: (worked before applying patch)
scripts/Makefile.clean:10: drivers/scsi/isp/Makefile: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** No rule to make target `drivers/scsi/isp/Makefile'.  Stop.
make[2]: *** [drivers/scsi/isp] Error 2
make[1]: *** [drivers/scsi] Error 2
make: *** [_clean_drivers] Error 2
I checked with kernel debugging and without.
I located linux/gdb.h in a directory called 25/ one branch up parellel to the patched linux tree.
I've checked on the list .. and pretty much anywhere I can find .. 
Maybe I'm just missing something really obvios .. 
any suggestions ?
