[long story about allocation of DMA buffers problem skipped]
Yes. It's VERY WELL known problem with linux MM :-(( Unfortunatelly right
solution will need deep rework of MM subsystem since now there are NO reliable
way to get contigous DMA-able region of memory > 4K (page). There are
some ideas floating around about possible solutions but it's not clear even
if it's 2.3 issue. It's not 2.2 issue for sure :-(( There are exists some
more or less reliable workarounds (load all modules like floppy or sound modules
on startup; `tail /dev/zero`, etc) but there are no general solution yet
(AFAIK anyway).
