I don't think filters is a good idea. They just keep multiplying out of
control. Kernel implementations are supposed to be simple, elegant
solutions to specific issues. The problem here is how to provide 'clustering'
of information without sacrificing accessibility. Clustering of
information includes both the file data, directory data, and meta-data.
My original proposal addressed most of these issues. First, non-specialized
applications would see special Meta-Files as ordinary files. There would be
no problem with FTP, cp, etc. There could be a problem with randomly
using commands that could alter a file, but that is why we have permissions.
I had already gone through the PRELOAD user space iteration, but there is
one big problem. The basic reason that I proposed this as a kernel issue was
the
problem of being able to execute an image that is contained within a
Meta-File.
Nearly all other features are user space issues.
Ignoring this thread's misinformed flaming ... I've considered (I think) the
shortfalls of the other implementations (e.g., MacOS) when I decided that
any Meta-File implementation MUST look like a standard file system
hierarchy to current applications. This permits all users and/or tools to
delve
into the meta-file and alter the content as needed. Protected by permissions.
I've begun seriously looking at implementation of basic meta-aware
patches. What I'm planning is essentially zero impact to existing systems
that do not use meta-files. Any meta-files placed on such a system will simply
be files. Meta-aware systems will register meta-file formats as is currently
done
for file system types. My 'binder' style would be one potential meta-file
format. VFS would access meta-file handlers only when the a file is tagged
as a meta-file. The meta-file handler then verifies the file format and
accepts the meta-file and adds it to a special VFS super block for meta-files.
At this point, the meta-handler simply is attached via the standard VFS
vectors to 'do the right thing' with standard VFS calls to handle the
meta-file itself. This preserves all the kernel handling of dcache, buffer,
mmap, and bin formats with no change (or very little at least).
In the binder meta-format (others may differ) a directory entry would have
additional data type/data format information ala mime. It would retain
user and group information as an embedded application may need some
euid/egid handling. I see no need for time information as this is all derived
and set in the file system entry. I do want a mark of some sort to indicate
that a binder has been changed from the original so we don't unintentionally
propagate modified versions (since we make FTPing so easy :) ).  Effective
permissions for an entry are derived by merging actual FS permissions
with those contained in the meta-file (probably an OR, but I need to think
about it more).  Symlinks would be permitted (perhaps limited), but hard
links would not.
In summary, meta-files look like directories outside the kernel. Inside the
kernel, special handlers, styled after VFS, handle the conversion between
VFS file view and Meta directory view. File flags tell VFS when a
meta-handler is to be invoked. These file flags must be explicitly set via
'chmod' (or equivalent). Linux file systems can save the flags, other FSes
must generate the flags as needed. Entries in a meta-file appear as standard
files (byte streams) to  existing applications. Meta-aware applications would
have additional searching and type handling available. They would also have
file name mapping applied. Two file flags indicate - Not a Meta-File;
Meta-File,
Meta-Application; and Meta-Special (for growth).
I'm not aware of the special W2K issues referenced in some messages, but
allowing differing meta-file handlers should provide a base to build upon.
(I did a quick dejanews search, but didn't see anything relevant.)  Everything
else I've read in these discussions seem to be addressed by this approach.
Such as ... multiple forks, special re-maps, nesting of meta-files, extended
type information, and legacy applications. Special filters and such are user
space issues - kernel provides the container, user space pours contents into
it. Did I miss something?
