The more I think about it, the less sense initializing f0 to 0 makes.
The whole problem with an uninitialized variable is that a random
value from the stack might be used.  So setting a variable to
something meaningless (guaranteeing that a garbage value is used in
case of a bug) just to shut up a warning makes no sense -- it's no
safer than leaving the code as is.  uninitialized_var() gets rid of
the warning, saves a little text and instruction cache, and documents
things better.
(BTW, I agree the code is a little confusing as written.  I think
things could be cleaned up and made more efficient by getting rid of
the initialization of size0 too -- I'll look at doing that)
Anyway, I queued this up for my next merge with Linus:

    IB/mthca: Use uninitialized_var() for f0
    Commit 9db48926 ("drivers/infiniband/hw/mthca/mthca_qp: kill uninit'd
    var warning") added "= 0" to the declarations of f0 to shut up gcc
    warnings.  However, there's no point in making the code bigger by
    initializing f0 to a random value just to get rid of a warning;
    setting f0 to 0 is no safer than just using uninitialized_var(), which
    documents the situation better and gives smaller code too.  For example,
    on x86_64:
    add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/2 up/down: 0/-16 (-16)
    function                                     old     new   delta
    mthca_tavor_post_send                       1352    1344      -8
    mthca_arbel_post_send                       1489    1481      -8
