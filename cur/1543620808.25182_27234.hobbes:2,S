I don't have any evil benchmarks to run, but it works just great on my
little laptop (192mb ram, 73mb swap). The O(1)-K3 patch against 12c also
applies fine, and does the right thing.
This is cool-beans stuff. Makes me glad that I'm just a bit adventurous.
Not adventurous enough for 2.5, but I'm running 2.4.17+rmap12e+O(1)K3
and CML2 and etc.[unhandled content-type:application/pgp-signature]
