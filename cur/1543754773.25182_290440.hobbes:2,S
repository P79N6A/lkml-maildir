Hello everybody,
today I patched myself up from 2.6.7 vanilla to 2.6.10 vanilla, but
after all patches succeeded, "make menuconfig" shows "v2.6.8.1
Configuration". Even worse, a compiled kernel calls in his bootlog
himself "2.6.8.1". When installing the whole kernel package, this
behaviour doesn't show up.
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but I could not find an answer in the
archives.
Have a nice day,
Viktor.
