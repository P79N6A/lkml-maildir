Hi,
I found out what causes higher idle temps when using mm-sources and 
2.6.4-rc vanilla sources: If I use PM Timer as timesource, it seems the 
C1 halt isn't properly called, at least CPU disconnect doesn't seem to 
work, thus leaving my CPU as hot as without disconnect.
using tsc timesource: idle temps of about 45-47°C
using pm timer: 52-53°C idle temps
Is this a bug or a feature?
I have nforce2 hardware. Tell me if you need anything else.
