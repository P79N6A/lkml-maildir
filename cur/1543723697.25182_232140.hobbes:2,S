Thank you for the hint!
I verified that changing CONFIG_EDD=y to '# CONFIG_EDD is not set' 
removed the 30-second pause at boot.
This 30-second pause only appeared recently on my x86-64 box (VIA-based 
Athlon64), so I'll bsearch changesets when I get a free moment (sometime 
this week).
I wonder, even, if it is related to the bootsetup.h fix from Matt that I 
forwarded recently.
