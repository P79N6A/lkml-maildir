two (or three) things I've done to help this, when I'm working remotely
add panic=30 to your kernel options in grub (or echo 30 >
/proc/sys/kernel/panic) to reboot the system automatically on panic.
set grub to automatically boot the safe kernel by default, and when
making a new kernel, set grub to boot it only once with (say your
default is 0 and the new kernel is 1 in grub)
echo 'savedefault --default=1 --once' | grub --batch
set up netconsole so that you can see the kernel messages (optional) on oops.
finding out about all these was incredibly hard and obtuse :-)  So
hope this helps.
