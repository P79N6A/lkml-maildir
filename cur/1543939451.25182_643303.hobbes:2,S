fs/bfs/bfs.h is not visible to the rest of the kernel, it's the right 
place for bfs-internal code.
Whether there's an "extern" written is just a syntax thing with zero 
semantical implications. We tend to not write the "extern" in the 
kernel, but that's nothing cast in stone.
But prototypes really belong into header files - bugs in this area are 
rare, but when they occur they can cause nasty hard-to-debug bugs
(e.g. depending on the calling convention on the architecture calling 
the function can turn your stack into garbage), and with the prototypes 
in header files gcc can do type checks.
