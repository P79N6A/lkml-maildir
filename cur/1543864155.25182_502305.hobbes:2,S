Data width is kind of hard to figure out since it's negotiated per
transaction.  One could conceive of a device which only does 32-bit
transactions to some addresses, and 64-bit transactions to others.
What I've done in recent patches is make these kinds of attributes
available per slot.

/sys/bus/pci/busses ?

I think they were added for Altix ... not sure who uses them.  Maybe X?
