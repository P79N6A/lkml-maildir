I'd appreciate it that if you would not overwrite the 2.6.14 record on
the kernel.org page, but add a new record for 2.6.14.y instead. It
would benefit others too. FYI:

It's uninteresting for people to install the stable kernel x.x.x.y
sometimes. Leave the base kernel x.x.x there would be convenient.
