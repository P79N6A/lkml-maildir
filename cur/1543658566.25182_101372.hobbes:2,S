I keep getting errors  simular to that listed below when I run make
modules_install. This happens for 2.5.52, and 2.5.54. 
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in
/lib/modules/2.5.54/kernel/net/netlink/netlink_dev.ko
This problem does not exist on 2.5.50.  My only problem is when using
the 2.5.50 kernel I get the following error on boot. After some research
I understood there is a bug or something in 2.5.50. can someone give me
some direction.  My reason for trying to use the 2.5 kernel is to
incorperate the IPSEC features of that kernel.
 Kernel panic on boot. Error below.  It's a 2.5.50 kernel  reiserfs 
 using initrd SuSE8.0
 QM_MODULES not implimented
 UDF-fs: No partition found
