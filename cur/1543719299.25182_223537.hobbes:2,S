The main problem with rsync that I can see is that it is fairly heavy
weight on the server, so many servers (including mirrors.kernel.org)
have a maximum number of connections set to something pathetically
small, like say 5 connections.  
I remember Tridge trying to get someone to implement checksum caching
for rsync servers some 4+ years ago, which would surely help.  Did
that ever get done?  If so, convincing the server admins that it's OK
to up the maximum number of rsync connections would be the next step.
