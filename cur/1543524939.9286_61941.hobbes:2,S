Oh it's been a while since I ran those tests, it was about the same
order for both receive and transmit. With Jumbo frames the numbers
certainly didn't go up.

Eeeek, now thats mean, how big is the TX ring on the SK card?

There's a latency tradeoff there, most coalescing algorithms basically
do wait for X packets and generate an interrupt or generate the
interrupt inbetween if there is more than Y usecs between packets. You
do not want an interrupt for each packet coming in.
