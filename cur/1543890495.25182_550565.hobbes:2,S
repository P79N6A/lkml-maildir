Could you please
a) add a Re: to the subject before answering yourself, so this gets a
thread, instead of single mails.
and b) maybe CC linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org as I do not think Ingo
Molnar is subscribed to this list here, but it would be good if he also
gets your reports in order to fix it.
Thanks.
