Pthreads are a standard. You say 'use linux native calls, are faster and
make signal management efficient'. But then portability goes to hell. Now
I can run the same code on Linux, Irix and Solaris. Your way, I would
have to write three versions with clone(), sproc() and lwp_xxxx().
Take the example of OpenGL on IRIX boxes. Time ago it was a wrapper over
IrisGL. Now it is native. If you have a notably poor implimentation of
an standard nobody will use your system.

Joking ? That only works if your more complex structure is an array. Try
to get a rendering program with a complex linked lits-tree data structure
for the geometry, materials, textures, etc and
thinking on cache affinity. You can only think about that locally: mmm, I
need a counter for each thread, I would not put them all in an array because
I will trash caches, lets put them in separate variables; need to return
data to a segment of a big array, lets use a local copy and then pass it back.
But no more. Yes, you can change all your malloc() or new for shm's, but
what is the gain ? That is the beauty of shared memory boxes.
What linux needs is a good implementation for POSIX threads. I do not mean
putting pthreads right into the kernel, but perhaps some small change or
addition can make the user space much much faster. There are many apps that
can benefit much from using threads, use a big data segment in ro mode,
and just communicate a bit between them (a threaded web server, a rendering
program).
