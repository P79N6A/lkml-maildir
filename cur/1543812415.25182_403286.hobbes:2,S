For CompactPCI, most boards I've encountered actually do not reserve any 
extra resources on the bridge to the hotplug bus.  I have had a patch for
a while that allows reallocating the resources for a specified bridge and 
all its children at boot time, and recently ported it to 2.6.  It doesn't
sound like you need it since you've got your own bootloader, but let me
know if you want to take a look at it.

Just a warning, cpci_configure_slot in cpci_hotplug_pci.c is somewhat
broken atm, I've got a small patch I was going to clean up and send to 
Greg for 2.6.17.  I can provide it if you want to compare a working 
cpci_configure_slot against cpqhp_configure_device.
