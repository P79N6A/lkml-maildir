Until GPLv3 there was no requirement that the modified code be able to operate 
on any given device - even the one its designed for. Claiming otherwise seems 
stupid to me, almost ridiculous.

But this can be done *NOW* - has been done by at least one company, IIRC. 
(and, IIRC again, they didn't so much as "not release the modified version" 
as "not release all tools/scripts/installation/build instructions")

I noticed that ten or twenty messages after I made that comment. In truth, the 
reason I made it was, and is, because I am tired of explaining the fact that 
there is no "one" interpretation of the GPLv2 - or any license - *UNLESS* it 
has been ruled on by a court. And even then, the courts ruling only applies 
to the parts of the license that were in contention before it.
