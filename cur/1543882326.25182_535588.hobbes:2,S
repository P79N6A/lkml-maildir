I was thinking that it would be nasty to have a set of platform
specific, compiler specific ifdefs in here.  I was more thinking of just
making this a BUG for all platforms.  This does result in slightly later
detection but this is a constant mode only, so any bad use of kmalloc()
would be picked up on first boot in testing always.
I think that would be sufficient and safe even against the worst
optimiser (none).  Plus much less horrible to look at?
