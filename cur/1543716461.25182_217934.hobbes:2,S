Thanks Randy.  As the below output shows, your patch
applies cleanly to 2.4.26 source, but I have not yet
had the chance to compile and test my configuration.
[root@plain linux-2.4.26]# patch init/do_mounts.c
usbboot-2422.patch 
patching file init/do_mounts.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 367 (offset 1 line).
