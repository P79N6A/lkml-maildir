I completely disagree here. The Linux development model isn't to code
the entire thing throw it over a wall and then deal with the collateral
damage. This first version assumes a heterogenous environment and from
what we see so far that seems to be the common usecase for this
technology. A prototype implementation is already done for label
translations and it does need to be outlined in the RFC (Which I've
already started doing). However it is not necessary for an initial
release. The translation engine allows you to plug in an arbitrary
module to support whatever LSM you are going to use so this end of the
architecture is agnostic to the format that is going to be used on the
wire. For now that format is just a secctx which assumes the LSM running
on both ends is the same. Once the basics are refined and we can use it
as a base we will keep adding more functionality (process label
transport, better change notification, server side policy enforcement,
translation mappings.) 
This is just a tiny fraction of what James outlined in the requirements
document. So, one step at a time lest we trip over imaginary stones.
