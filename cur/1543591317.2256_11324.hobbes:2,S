Ten times a day?
But booting is special case: You can read your mail while compiling kernel, 
but try to read your mail while your machine is booting.
What's worse, boot time tends to be time critical, as in "I need to find that 
mail that tells me where I'm expected to be half an hour from now. Ouch. It's 
going to take 40 minutes to get there."
