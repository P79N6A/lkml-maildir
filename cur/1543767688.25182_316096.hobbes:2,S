The disadvantage is that you then lose accuracy since each timer 
interval is increased by some random amount based on system scheduling. 
  What about some kind of ulimit-type thing to specify the minimum 
recurring interval that can be specified?  If root so specifies, you 
could have 1usec interval timers and the system would hang.  This is 
conceptually no different than busy-looping in a SCHED_FIFO task.
