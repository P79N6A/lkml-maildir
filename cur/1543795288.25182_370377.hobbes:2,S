Hi. 
I am trying to build 2.6.15-rc2-git3, but it fails with an error:
make: *** [arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
  CHK     include/linux/compile.h
  CHK     usr/initramfs_list
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.o
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c: In function `set_mtrr':
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:225: error: `ipi_handler' undeclared 
(first use in this function)
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:225: error: (Each undeclared identifier 
is reported only once
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c:225: error: for each function it 
appears in.)
make[3]: *** [arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.o] Error 1
make[2]: *** [arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr] Error 2
make[1]: *** [arch/i386/kernel/cpu] Error 2
make: *** [arch/i386/kernel] Error 2
  CHK     include/linux/version.h
...
(vmlinuz/initial ramdisk image are not built, etc.)
....
but ipi_handler seems to be defined at line 141 in 
/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/main.c.  However, my build script does not 
include SMP (I'm on a single cpu machine), and ipi_handler is wrapped in
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
#endif
(my SMP build options are):
CONFIG_BROKEN_ON_SMP=y
# CONFIG_X86_BIGSMP is not set
# CONFIG_SMP is not set
CONFIG_X86_FIND_SMP_CONFIG=y
....
(The obvious solution is to change my script to CONFIG_SMP=Y, but I 
suspect there is a more elegant solution).
2.6.15-rc2 builds/runs ok with the same build script.
Please mail me directly as I'm not on the list.
TIA
Bob
