No, currently you first choose the CPU. This CPU selection selects most 
settings like the CPU features (e.g. enables X86_F00F_BUG) and the gcc 
optimization flags.
The "Generic x86 support" question is asked later.
My patch removes the generic option since it's no longer needed.

Ah I didn't know that. The 20030831 snapshot of the 3.3 branch in Debian 
unstable was the latest gcc I checked.

I'll send the cpu selection patch with the arch/i386/kernel/cpu/ and 
arch/i386/kernel/cpu/mtrr/ stuff as separate patches.
