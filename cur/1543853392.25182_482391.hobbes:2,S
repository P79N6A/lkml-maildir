See more below...  Basically, the patch looks good enough to submit for
inclusion.  Can you CC it to Andrew on the next iteration.

This _should_ probably also include a check for the backup group descriptors
and superblock, but unfortunately the helpers ext3_bg_has_super() and
ext3_bg_num_gdb() are fairly CPU intensive and not something you want to
check for each block that is allocated/freed.  In the future (mballoc) when
we have per-group data structs we can just store a flag per group whether
it has a backup or not instead of recomputing the powers of 3, 5, 7 each time.
Maybe a comment for now to indicate that needs to be fixed in the future?
Also a minor nit - this is actually checking "num" blocks, and it might be
useful in the future so it would be clearer to call it something like
ext3_blocks_are_metadata().

Actually, in newer kernels ext3_bg_num_gdb() includes INCOMPAT_META_BG
support, so that may be enough.
