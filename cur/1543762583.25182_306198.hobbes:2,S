Jeff,
I'm seeing single drives getting stuck in ata_busy_sleep() with these
log messages on boot:
<4>ata2 is slow to respond, please be patient
<3>ata2 failed to respond (30 secs)
One thing I found was the bug fixed below, where the COMRESET wasn't
getting flushed properly.  This may or may not be the reason, but it
can't hurt.  I have to keep looking and testing.
I wanted to also send a separate patch to ensure the port was stopped
before issuing COMRESET, since this is required by at least the ICH6R,
but the port_stop() routines seemed too heavy to call from
__sata_phy_reset() so I'm not sending anything like that yet.
