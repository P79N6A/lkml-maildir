Right,
Those 4-5 bug reports should test Alan's patch.
All the problem is detected the correct devices that should be quirked.
In 2.6.16, all ( PCI_VENDOR_ID_VIA, PCI_ANY_ID), in 2.6.16.17 just some.
Still questionable if this quirks is for on-board VIA when interrupts
are in PIC mode, or for all interrupts modes (historically before the
patch to be for IO-APIC and PIC mode, was just for PIC mode, but in that
time IO-APIC wasn't common on PC) .
So with Alan's patch the question is:if a device need to be quirked and
don't. 
Those 4-5 reports will answer the question, they needs VIA quirks and we
want know is the patch do the right job. 
My laptop that need the quirks and I can test it is not available right
now and I am too busy to test on it, sorry.
Thanks,
