hello, i followed the last thread, "unable to burn DVD", and there was a
patch, which was said to work, but it does not.. (i am running
2.6.11-rc1-bk9)..
the problem started around 2.6.9 (or something like it), when i was only
able to burn 1 dvd, then i had to restart before i could burn another
(or every second dvd i burn would fail), the error i get is input/output
error.. my burner is working perfect, since it works on windows, and on
2.6.9-rcSomething.
it is not a specific place in the burning process it fails, sometimes at
10%, and sometimes at 97%
burning normal cd's works perfectly
now on 2.6.10 and 2.6.11-later i cant burn dvd's at all, every time i
try to burn one, it fails, i have tried different speeds and media, same
thing, i got a Liteon sohw1213S dvd duallayer burner, allthough im not
using duallayer media.
here is a log from a burning i just tried:
/dev/hda: engaging DVD-R DAO upon user request...
/dev/hda: reserving 2149200 blocks
/dev/hda: "Current Write Speed" is 4.1x1385KBps.
