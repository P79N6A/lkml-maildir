I agree.
Imagine a webserver with all it's webpages on a 40 GB EXT-2 partition
on /dev/sda1.
If I wanted to move the data on to a ReiserFS partition, I would just:
* Create the new partition on another device, E.G. /dev/sdb1
* Mount /dev/sda1 read-only
* Copy the data across to /dev/sdb1 as a nice process
* Stop the webserver processes
* Unmount /dev/sda1
* Mount /dev/sdb1 read-only
* Restart the webserver processes
* Test it
* Mount /dev/sdb1 read-write
* Keep /dev/sda1 around as a quick-to-access backup until I was sure
  it was all working correctly.
* Re-use /dev/sda1
The webserver would be off-line for only a few seconds, and
performance would not be significantly degraded at any time.
