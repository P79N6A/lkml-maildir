Page cache pollution is a totally different issue.  At  60MB/sec
we aren't even close to the performance levels where memory bandwidth
is an issue, so extra copies into the cache are irrelevant from a
bandwidth point of view.  Of _course_ raw IO has less impact on
memory, but that's another point entirely.
