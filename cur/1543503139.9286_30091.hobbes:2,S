Ok, you probably can have machine in state where it will crash during
writing to floppy or when it will write garbage on floppy. But I do
not think it will accidentally overwrite part of harddrive, which is
*the* thing you don't want it to do; and which is the thing that could
be pretty probable if you "just" stored starting offset onto
hdd. Misprogrammed ide controller is just too dangerous. Misprogrammed
floppy controller can do *much* less damage.
I think that if patch tries to first read first sector and makes sure
it begins with "CRASHFLOPPY" signature, it should be pretty safe.
