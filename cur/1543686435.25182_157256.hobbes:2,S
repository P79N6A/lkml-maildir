I ran an Database workload on the test3-mm1 bits and got around 20% 
improvement.  These bits have Suparna's readahead_patch. 
The number of 4k read requests sent to the driver reduced significantly by
95%. Effectively generating lesser number of larger-size read-requests.
And the number of readahead-window-resets dropped down by 50%.
FYI,
