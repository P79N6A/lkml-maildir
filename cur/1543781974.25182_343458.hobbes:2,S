sched_clock() shouldn't really be taken outside kernel/sched.c,
especially for things like this.
It actually has some fundamental problems even in its current
use in the scheduler (which need to be fixed). But basically it
is a very nasty interface with a rather tenuous relationship to
time.
Why not use something like do_gettimeofday? (or I'm sure one
of our time keepers can suggest the right thing to use).
