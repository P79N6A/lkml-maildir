Correct me if I'm wrong here.
You claimed that the collision techniques found for the UFN design hashs
(sha0, md5, md5, haval, ripemd) demonstrated the need to not rely on hash
algorithms for a RNG.  Right?
And I showed that the SHA-1 in random.c now can produce collisions.  So, if
your argument against the fallen UFN hashs above (SHA-1 is a UFN hash also
btw.  We can probably expect more annoucments from the crypto community in
early 2005) should it not apply to SHA-1 in random.c?
Or did I misunderstand you?  Were you just mentioning the weakened algorithms
as a "what if they were more serious discoveries?  Wouldn't be be nice if we
didn't rely on them?" ?
The decision to place trust in a entropy estimation scheme vs. a crypto
algorithm we have different views on.  I can live with that.

I "completly and totally" agree.  I'm pointing out that no added padding
makes me, the new guy reading your code, work harder to decide if it's a
weakness.  You shouldn't do that to people if you can avoid it.  Just like
you shouldn't obfuscate code, even if it doesn't "weaken" its implementation.
It's just rude.  Take the performance penalty to avoid scaring people away
from a very important peice of the kernel.

The quantitaive aspects of the two RNGs in question are not being discussed.
It's the qualitative aspects we do not see eye to eye on.  So I will no
longer suggest replacing the status-quo.  I'd like to submit a patch to let
users chose at compile-time under Cryptographic options weither to drop in
Fortuna.
Ted, can we leave it at this?
