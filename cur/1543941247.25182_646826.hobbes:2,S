hey all,
since i'm not completely sure where this bug goes, i'll try lkml and
linux-dvb list.
first of all: my "test" computer is a ubuntu gutsy system (standard) on
a dell latitude D810. the tv card: a Kworld v-stream dvb-t usb2.
the bug: 
http://harry.enzoverder.be/dvb-crash.txt
 (some irrelevance stripped,
like other boot logs)
http://harry.enzoverder.be/lspci
 for lspci -vvv output
the kernel/system.map images etc... are trivial i hope...
i'm running this kernel:
Linux version 2.6.22-14-generic (buildd@terranova) (gcc version 4.1.3
20070929 (prerelease) (Ubuntu 4.1.2-16ubuntu2)) #1 SMP Tue Dec 18
08:02:57 UTC 2007
i don't know what else i need to provide, but i hope this does the trick
for you guys. if there is anything i can do to help/test/patch/..., let
me know!
i'm not subscribed, so please, include me in replies
thanks dudes!
ps. i used the dvb-usb-adstech-usb2-02.fw firmware. it's VERY hard to
find the firmware... (it's not on linuxtv.org btw) where do you find
firmware?
