	Folks, there are several fixes to FAT patch, so I've put the new
version to
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/fat-patch-7.gz	FAT (incremental over rename)
ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/rename+fat-patch-7.gz	FAT (combined).
	It's still *VERY* *ALPHA*. It still contains bugs that may give fs
corruption. Don't try it anywhere near live data. UMSDOS still doesn't
work with that version.
	No changes in rename patch.
							Cheers,
								Al
