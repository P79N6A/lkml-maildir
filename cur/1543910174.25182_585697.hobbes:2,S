So this patch does three things at least:
-> adds early_printk
-> delete cruft emulating early printk
-> add an early excaption handler
That seems to explain why I could not follow your code changes.
A more fine grained splitup would have helped here.
I noticed that you copied the actual early_printk code from x86_64.
What was preventing you from just using the x86_64 code here?
A simple
#include <arch/x86_64/boot/early_printk.c>
in the blackfin early_printk should do the trick.
alpha btw uses the implementation in lib/*printf.c
Are there a specific reason why blackfin and x86_64 does not do the same?
Thinking that all should do the same so maybe alpha ought to change...
