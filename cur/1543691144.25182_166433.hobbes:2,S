The 2.4 default config is in arch/$ARCH/defconfig

That gets really messy or unreliable fast if you have more
than one kernel.  And if you build your own you better have
more than one.

it is CONFIG_PROC_CONFIG
menuconfig: filesystems->/proc/config.gz
right below /proc filesystem support.
Came in really handy for me when i recently applied SuSE's
kernel update rpm and it overwrote the kernel tree including
.config.  Fortunately i had turned it on in an earlier
build.  If it wasn't enabled it won't do you any good.
Although understating the size a bit (mine are 4K-6KB) the
help text is to the point:
	The cost is around 1K-4K of running memory. Only say
	no if you really can't spare this. You can sneeze
	and lose more on memory than this.
