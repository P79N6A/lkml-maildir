Grumble... and I suppose a failed execve() needs to return an error
to that one thread, but a succesful one needs to atomically destroy all
the other threads...  And HOW is this supposed to be implemented?
The previous version of the standard had this right - just leave it
undefined and let the OS try to do something sane.  Hopefully this part
will get nixed before the final revision.
