Subject: 2.4.3-ac2 -- How do I determine if shm is being used?

I have mounted:
	none on /var/shm type shm (rw)
	tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
Yet, running "x11perf -shmput10" gives me:
X Error of failed request:  BadValue (integer parameter out of range for
operation)
  Major opcode of failed request:  146 (MIT-SHM)
  Minor opcode of failed request:  3 (X_ShmPutImage)
  Value in failed request:  0x1600001
  Serial number of failed request:  35107
  Current serial number in output stream:  35111
I'd like to check to make sure that shm is actually accessible
to my programs.  Is there any easy way to do this?
I have already checked the values of:
	/proc/sys/kernel/shmall = 2000000
	/proc/sys/kernel/shmmax = 4096
	/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni = 35000000
Thanks,
	Miles
