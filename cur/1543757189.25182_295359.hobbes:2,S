Subject: [PATCH] fix units/partition count in sd.c (2.4.x)

Hi,
This patch fixes the nr_real count in sd.c, which is also used
in genhd.c to print out the partitions/units.  The problem is that
nr_real is decremented on detach, the genhd's nr_sects is
cleared but the entry is still there and is being counted
for when displaying the partitions.  Thus when nr_real
is decremented _and_ a 0-ed partition/unit is counted,
we get to not display 1 or more entries of the tail of
the list.
The solution is to not decrement nr_real on detach, effectively
never decrementing it, and so that it doesn't grow without a bound,
to throttle it on attach, incrementing it only if it would be
smaller than nr_dev.
This was observed on a RH kernel and on the current BK kernel.
Tested and fixed on 2.4.30-pre1 (BK).  This patch is against 2.4.30-pre1.
To reproduce: assume 4 scsi disks sda, sdb, sdc, sdd.
#echo "scsi remove-single-device <sdb-HCTL>" > /proc/scsi/scsi
#cat /proc/partitions
<<sdb _and_ sdd are not listed>>
