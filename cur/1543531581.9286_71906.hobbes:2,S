Oops, myself, I should have looked to see if there where more replies on
to this thread...
I don't think I'm seeing the same thing as you.
I normally don't load gpm on this machine, so it isn't started by
default.  I rebooted with the a newly compiled 2.3.99-pre3 which was a
make oldconfig from my working 2.3.51.  After reboot I started up X, it
didn't complain about not finding a mouse, actually the initialization
messages reported finding my 3 button PS/2 mouse just like normal.  But
after X was finished loading there was no mouse cursor to be seen
(although it did flash for a second during the startup).
I got out of X and cat'ed /proc/interrupts the PS/2 mouse wasn't even
listed (but I did see the huge number of USB interupts, which is what
provoked my other e-mail).  I loaded gpm just to see what would
happen.  It loaded and worked fine.  /proc/interrupts now did show a count
for the PS/2 mouse.
Just to be on the safe side I recompiled a kernel without USB support, it
made no difference.
So, as I said before, it does sound like an X problem, since gpm finds the
mouse fine, but but the problem seems to be trigged by the kernel.  So who
needs to fix it?  Is X assuming something about the psaux device that it
shouldn't or has something been removed from the psaux driver that really
should be there?
