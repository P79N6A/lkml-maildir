  Well, I didn't think that I was using any NFS mounts.
But, it turns out I was in a way.  Apparently, amd does its top
level mounts with noac.  So, where this (using an automounted path):
    cd /h/spo/work
    make -j 5
would be slow.  This (using a non-automounted path):
    cd /home/spo/work
    make -j 5
showed the faster performance I was expecting.
  I will mark my bug as invalid and decide what, if anything,
I want to do about amd.
  Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
