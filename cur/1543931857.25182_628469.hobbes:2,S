thanks, i've applied your kprobes pre-unification patches to x86.git. 
While we are at it, it might be nice to reduce the numbers of checkpatch 
warnings:
 $ scripts/checkpatch.pl --file arch/x86/kernel/kprobes*.c  | grep total
 total: 10 errors, 9 warnings, 959 lines checked
 total: 10 errors, 8 warnings, 923 lines checked
to 0/0 ? :-) (but that can happen after the unification too)
