Subject: stallion.c patch for devfs

Precedence: bulk

I made the following patch for the stallion non-intelligent driver based on
cut/paste from serial.c.  I have tested it and it works, the directories
/dev/tte and /dev/cue are correctly created when the module is inserted.
Could this please be put in to 2.4.0-test8?
Please note that this patch is to be applied after the stallion.c file has
been moved from the drivers/media/video directory to the drivers/char
directory.
