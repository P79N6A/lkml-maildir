Hi all!
As it was mentioned about "Pentium III Processor Specification Update."
(
http://developer.intel.com/design/PentiumIII/specupdt/
) I decided to read it
and it seems that 'Memory Ordering' doesn't work as it planned.
Errata sections:
E36. Potential Loss of Data Coherency During MP Data Ownership Transfer
E39. Memory Ordering Based Synchronization May Cause a Livelock Condition
     in MP Systems.
Bye.
PS. There are also errata notes on SYSENTER/SYSEXIT instructions, Debug faults
    generated instead of GPF, and many other interesting funny bugs ...
