Yea. I was thinking about it other way around - that you have module which
uses some functions from another helper module only during startup - but
that call comes from driver into helper module. But it is possible to arrange
it other way around.

My kernel says 68kB released before starting init - and I have only AIC7870,
IPV4,UNIX,EXT2 and matroxfb+fbdev stuff compiled into kernel. Maybe that
it is in very small chunks from couple of modules, but maybe not. And if
you ever run 2.3.x with 8MB of memory, you'll find what 68kB of additional
memory means.

If we can split it in the way that there is no call from foo-proper to
anything-init, then yes. But it does not solve problem where you'll find
init section if (hotplug) driver is compiled into kernel.
