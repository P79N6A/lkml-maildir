Exactly. So, naming it lock_cpu_online() would make no sense.

That would be very good considering the fact that CPU hotplug
is getting broken often. Another nice thing to see would be
i386 cpu hotplug support. That would allow lot more developers
to test their code with cpu hotplug. Not sure where that one is now.
Perhaps Zwane knows.
