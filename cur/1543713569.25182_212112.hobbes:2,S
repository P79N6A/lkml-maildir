And if it wasn't that this would result in requiring every call to
specify the number of bits, resulting in one more chance for a stupid
error, and one less for type checking, I'd vote to remove
cpumask_t/nodemask_t, as I understand you would prefer.
One should resist infrastructure if one can nuke a layer entirely.
But half-baked layers introduce one more form of difficult to
remember inconsistency.
Hmmm ...
