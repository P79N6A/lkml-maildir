Far too complex.  See what Russell wrote, for instance.
When you are in a kernel thread, you can write more simple, 
straightforward, easy-to-debug code that does
	blah
	msleep()
	blah
rather than creating an insanely complicated state machine for the same 
thing.
ESPECIALLY if you are already inside a state machine (the case with 
libata PIO data xfer), you do not want to add another state machine 
inside of that.
A great many uses of kernel threads are to simplify device reset and 
polling in this way.  I know; a year ago I audited every kernel thread, 
because I was so frustrated with the per-CPU thread explosion.
Thus, rather than forcing authors to make their code more complex, we 
should find another solution.
