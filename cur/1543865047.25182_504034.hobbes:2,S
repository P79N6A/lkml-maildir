Talk about util-linux and rpm, whose maintainers were/are unwilling to give
back the project to those who would really like to work on it.
At least I don't differentiate between userspace and kernelspace when it
comes to "hijacking projects back for the better". foobar is left where it
is, and is commonly forked into foobar-ng. It's just naming. Just pull in
lirc and tag it lirc-ng.
