   It depends how predictable your content is. With a 64bit box and a porn
   server its probably quite tidy
   
Let's say you have infinite VM (which is what 64-bit almost is :) then
the cost is setting up all of these useless VMAs for each and every
file (which is a 1 time cost, ok), and also the VMA lookup each
write() call.
With sendfile() all of this goes straight to the page cache directly
without a VMA lookup.
