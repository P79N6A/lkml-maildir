I merged this into your earlier change (moving machine_shutdown() into
process.c).  Linus pulled it last night.
I also added a "#ifdef CONFIG_KEXEC" around the call to kexec_disable_iosapic()
(because I first noticed that this was undefined when building non-KEXEC kernels).
But perhaps it might have been better to #define an empty stub for this function
inside kexec.h for the #ifndef CONFIG_KEXEC case?
