yeah, that's good enough. I'd still suggest to first test new kernels
with all the debug options on, to make sure it's stable. For performance
comparisons turn all the debug options off.
i'd also suggest to turn the NMI watchdog off (if enabled), that can
inject a 10-20 usec latency into any critical path. For the absolute
lowest latencies i'd also suggest to turn off all the APIC options
(possible in a UP kernel only, and only if the XT-PIC setup doesnt cause
unacceptable IRQ-line sharing), the IO-APIC mask handling is a bit
expensive compared to the XT-PIC.
If you find (or suspect) larger latencies anywhere then PREEMPT_TIMING +
LATENCY_TRACE + preempt_enable=4 is the preferred variant to use. (right
now it's not possible to do wakeup-timing without LATENCY_TRACE, i'll
fix that.)
