Doesn't matter.  The problem is that dwmw2's NS16550A patch (from ages
ago) changes the prescaler setting for this device so we can use the
higher speed baud rates.  This means any programmed divisor (programmed
at early serial console initialisation time) suddenly becomes wrong as
soon as we fiddle with the prescaler during normal UART initialisation
time.
I think the argument for not initialising serial console _until_ after
UART initialisation time is gaining more technical merit:
1. spinlock initialisation issues (see other threads)
2. prescaler/divisor interaction issues (this thread)
even though it isn't _that_ desirable.
