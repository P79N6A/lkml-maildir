P.S.  If you try this, change STARVATION_LIMIT from 1*HZ to 
2*MAX_TIMESLICE.  With that, I can run a make -j5 bzImage, irman with fixed 
mem_load, thud 3 and kasteroids with no trouble at ALL on my 128mb 
p3/500.  The only time things get ugly is when memload fires up.  It 
allocates 72mb and scribbles to it... a bit much for a 128mb box with 
_this_ load ;-)  Even then, swapping like heck, kasteroids is playable most 
of the time.
Without the patch, irman's process load starves everyone to death, and thud 
3 utterly destroys interactivity.  YMMV of course (it _is_ an experiment... 
might even explode;)
