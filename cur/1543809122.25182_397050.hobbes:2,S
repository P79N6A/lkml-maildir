True, and the point I was trying to make. Joerg has a policy that works well 
on some systems and doesn't on others. Rather than giving people a clear 
option to use the other system he has. In Linux udev provides a user 
configurable policy that works extremely well. Rather than change the 
software to accomodate udev/hald as he accomodates vold on Solaris Joerg 
insists on having *nearly* pointless warnings and insisting that his method 
is the only valid one.
That's the reason I asked him if he'd accept a patch that removed said warning 
and converted the device the user passed in (be it /dev/sr0 or /dev/cdrw) and 
internally converts it into his naming scheme. I have yet to see a response 
to this.

PS: Joerg my offer for that still stands, as does my offer to _attempt_ to fix 
the bugs you've reported in the ATAPI layer. Sadly I cannot offer to repair 
ide-scsi, as that is deprecated and scheduled for removal. However, with that 
being the case my offer to attempt to repair the noted problems with the 
mangling of commands by the ATAPI system remains. All I ask for is a detailed 
report including which model drives have the problem and debugging output so 
that I can attempt to repair the problem since I do not have the access to 
hardware that you do.
