VMware is able to emulate three different network card types:
- AMD Am79C970A - PCnet LANCE PCI Ethernet Controller (linux pcnet32 driver)
- Intel E1000 (e1000 driver)
- VMXNET - VMware PCI Ethernet Adapter (vmxnet, vmware`s own driver)
so there are 3 different drivers being used inside the guest OS for networking virtual machines.
rumours tell, that the vmxnet driver is sort of a mess, but i have seen the unregister_netdevice problem with pcnet32 AND with vmxnet - and all of the vmware readme`s are telling:
"In many Linux distributions, if IPv6 is enabled, VMware Tools cannot be configured with vmware-config-tools.pl after installation. In this case, VMware Tools is unable to set the network device correctly for the virtual machine, and displays a message similar to
Unloading pcnet32 module
unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0 to become free"
so - this is the native linux driver for pcnet32 which fails get unloaded _before_ the driver being replaced by the vmware specific one and the virtual nic being switched to the VMXNET adapter.....
anyway - i got that problem while shutting down a VM, not while installing vmware tools.
btw - just came across this posting from jesper juhl:
