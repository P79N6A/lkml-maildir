Why would this be more appropriate than defining __kernel_ino_t on the
x86_64 platform to be of the size that you actually want the kernel to
support?
I can see no good reason for truncating inode number values on platforms
that actually do support 64-bit inode numbers, but I can see several
reasons why you might want not to (utilities that need to detect hard
linked files for instance).
Cheers,
