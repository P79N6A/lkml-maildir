         Hello folks, seems that i found the potential bug which
    led to the infinite trace i`ve described before.
   Facts:
       1. My host have 24M of RAM and on kernels 2.4.x;x>7 it  started
   to have n-order alloc failures.
       2. In very rare circumsistances under 2.4.8-ac12 i have
   1-order alloc failures.
       3. sound_alloc_dmap::dmabuf.c comments states it will loop
   until the buffer is alloced
       4. sound_alloc_dmap::dmabuf.c comments states it wont accept buffer
   lesser than 8k in size.
   Logic:
      3 + 4 => it loops forever when 1-order alloc fails
      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 => my host crashes
      * comment to point 2: very rare circumcistances includes
   that some time should pass to fragment memory
cheers, Sam
