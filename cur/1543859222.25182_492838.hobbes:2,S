I can't remember a patch that removes mapped pages from this code path,
however I could have missed it. All out removing the mapping branch in
ttfb() did also fix the problem - which is a superset of page_mapped().
I'm now building a kernel with this patch, and will submit that to
rtorrent with mem=256M on a 1k ext3 filesystem on x86_64 smp preempt.
