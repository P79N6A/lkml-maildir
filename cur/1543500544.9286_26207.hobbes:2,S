I had a fast review of your patch and I think you missed a
page-cache-corruption bug that I fixed in my buffer patch sent one hour
ago.

I don't think the protected bit is obsolete. It still make sense for the
metadata. And it will forbid shrink_mmap to release the page since now the
page is the backend of the ramdisk. We only need to clear the protected
bit in flushpage for truncate (exactly where now we wait for the buffer to
complete I/O before marking it clean and freeing it). Then the ramdisk
should be near to work again.
