Oh, and users will violently oppose when you meddle with drivers and any
user-space application stops working because of dropping ide-scsi on the
floor. I have been using ide-scsi for ages to drive CD-ROM (mostly) and
it's not given me headaches. I like being able to access my CD-ROM as
/dev/scd0 regardless if it's SCSI or ATAPI, and if any troubles had
arrived on hardware no older than 1997, ide-scsi has solved it for me.
