Actually, there's one even more severe problem with
platform_pci_choose_state...
If we are doing freeze for swsusp snapshot (or freeze for kexec or
something similar, that ACPI does not know about), it is very wrong to
ask ACPI to tell us power levels for devices. ACPI does not even know
about those states, it can not tell us anything meaningfull.
So if this hook is to be reintroduced, it should go down in the
function, and only trigger for ACPI S3 and ACPI S1 cases. Maybe for
swsusp/plaform (== ACPI S4).
But I'd prefer the hook to go away for now, it clearly needs
infrastructure that is not yet there, and provides nothing.
