Perhaps changing the name from "namespace" to "interface" would help?
Then a module could have something like
MODULE_USE_INTERFACE(foo);
and I think that makes it clearer what the advantage of this is: it
marks symbols as being part of a certain interface, requires modules
that use that interface to declare that use explicitly, and allows
reviewers to say "Hey why is this code using the scsi interface when
it's a webcam driver?"
