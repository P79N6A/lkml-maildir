No, I meant just a simple "just call clear_inode() from 
udf_clear_inode()". But on a slightly closer look I notice that won't 
work, since it will just cause recursion (well, you could just clear the 
s_op field to avoid it, but that would be uglier than your fix).
I wonder if we should perhaps just move the invalidate_inode_buffers() 
call later in clear_inode(). That's a scary change, though. 
I just think your patch is pretty ugly. I'm sure it works, but I also 
suspect it indicates some kind of more fundamental problem. I also wonder 
why udf needs it but nobody else does (others do preallocation too)
