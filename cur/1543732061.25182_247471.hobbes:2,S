Something is borked in ACPI:
drivers/built-in.o(.text+0x1cf2c): In function `acpi_pci_root_add':
/root/linux/2.6.9-rc1-mm2/drivers/acpi/pci_root.c:270: undefined reference to `pci_acpi_scan_root'
Didn't actually realise I had ACPI config'ed in, so will just get rid of
it, but though you might want to know.
