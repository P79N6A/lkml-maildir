The analysis is exactly correct, well done!  I think your patch is a bit
overly complex, though.  We can achieve the same effect simply by
executing the completion without changing the rq_status like the patch
below.
Jens,  To go back to the original problem, except when I hit the usb-
storage error handling oops, I can plug and unplug to my hearts content
and everything works.
