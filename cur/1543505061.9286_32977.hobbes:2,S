Ouch!  No secondary DNS?  I thought to do DNS that Internic
required 2 DNS servers...

Sorry, I can't help there.  I admin some DNS's but don't have
authority to do something like that to any of the boxes - or I
would no prob.  If all goes well though, within a few months,
I'll have my own online commercial website, and hopefully not
long after that my own permanent dedicated machine.  ;o)
Then I call the shots.  ;o)
Take care Riley.
