As I said to Vivek in a private mail, it would be very nice to see
if this could be done by replacing hlfsd with namespace groups.
Al Viro has already done all the VFS layer work, which should be ready
and working in existing 2.4.20 and 2.5.x kernels. What is missing is
userland support for doing a CLONE_NEWNS, and then mounting the user's
home directory, mailspool,.... in the appropriate locations at login
time.
Cheers,
