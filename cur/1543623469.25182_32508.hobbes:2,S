	Yes, that's what I want to do it. But with regards to TCP,
there is no difference if packets are buffered within PPP or below
PPP. So, reducing buffering in PPP is also a win.

	Yep.

	Not true. It all depend of the timeframe of those
retransmissions, and how they are triggered. That's why TCP works
properly on 802.11b. Of course, this assume that the link
retransmissions are designed properly.

	Not true. Try running TCP on links with 20% packet losses.
	Also, any ethernet driver flow control the stack through
netif_stop/start_queue() to avoid local overruns.

	Already read those. Guess what, my name is event in the
acknowledgments ! How bizzare ;-)
