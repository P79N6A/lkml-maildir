Subject: [git pull] PCI updates for 2.6.26
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/4/29/398

Nothing really major here: some bug fixes, documentation fixes and some
trivial stuff for 2.6.26.  Some of the more important changes are actually
coming in through Ingo's "big box" tree, so the excitement (and risk) level
here should be pretty low.
So please pull from
git pull git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jbarnes/pci-2.6.git for-linus
I hope I got this tree right; I read through some of the earlier discussions
about how trees should be run.  This branch hasn't seen any merges from your
tree (I think you suggested this); hopefully there won't be any conflicts.
Thanks,
Jesse
