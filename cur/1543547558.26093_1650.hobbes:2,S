No, it's much better than that in 2.4!  The 2.4 4GB option still has
the 3+1 split, and only maps the first just-under-1GB of physical
memory into the kernel's permanent VA space.  The rest of the memory
is mapped on demand.

Right.

What happens at this point?  If you strace the binary, what fails?
