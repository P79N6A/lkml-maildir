I've been getting a couple of audio skips with 2.6.0-test9-mm2. Haven't heard a 
skip since test4 or so, so I'm assuming this is a result of the IO scheduler tweaks.
Here's how I can produce a skip:
Running X, general usage (e.g. couple of xterms, an emacs, maybe a 
mozilla-thunderbird)
I switch to the first virtual console with Ctrl+Alt+F1. I then switch back to X 
with Alt+F7. As X is redrawing the screen, the audio skips once.
This happens most of the time, but its easier to reproduce when i am compiling 
something, and also when I cycle through the virtual consoles before switching 
back to X.
System:
AMD XP2600+
nForce2 motherboard
512MB RAM
nvidia GeForce4 Ti4800
Audio being played through the intel8x0 alsa module.
I use the nvidia binary graphics driver with X.
XMMS 1.2.8
XFree 4.3.0
If theres any other info I can give, please tell me and I'll do my best to help out.
