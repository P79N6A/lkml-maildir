OK, thanks for checking.  Did you confirm that we don't have unneeded code
in vmlinux when CONFIG_PROCFS=n?  I guess before-and-after comparison of
the size(1) output would tell us.
Those networking build problems appear to have already been fixed.
In future, please quote the compiler error output in the changelog when
sending build fixes or warning fixes, thanks.
