If the original size was at 80x25, and vgacon_doresize() was called, the
the resulting screen is only 80x12.5. The 13th line has its bottom half
chopped off, and the rest of the lines (14-25) is invisible.
If he sets it at < 25, he gets a window much smaller than 12.5, but he did
not specify. So my guess is his chipset programs the screen height by 1/2
of the value of the requested rows.
