No, not that I am aware of.  How can I find out?
I confirmed this on a standard rhel4 virgin-install.  Does rhel4 have prelink 
enabled by default?
But even so, I don't think this is a timing issue, as the slowdowns are so 
huge it is obvious even without timing.
And 2.4.31 doesn't have this problem.
Did you try it?
Thanks!
