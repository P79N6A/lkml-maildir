Or just doing a large write while doing lots of reads... my personal
nemesis is "mkisofs" for backups, which reads lots of small files and
builds a CD image, which suddenly gets discovered by the kernel and
written, seemingly in a monolythic chunk. I MAY be able to improve this
with tuning the bdflush parameters, and I tried some tentative patches
which didn't make a huge gain.
I don't know if the solution lies in forcing write to start when a certain
size of buffers are queued regardless of percentages, or in better
scheduling of reads ahead of writes, or whatever.
