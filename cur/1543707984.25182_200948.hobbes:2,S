I don't know how accurate this information is, but... (take it with a 
grain of salt)
I have a good friend who worked at a lab where a lot of scientific 
simulations were being done.  Lots of floating-point math.  His 
colleagues tried both AMD and Intel processors.  According to this 
friend, what they found was that not only were the AMD processors FASTER 
at FP math, but the results they got were also a lot more ACCURATE when 
dealing with computations at the far end of FP precision.
In theory, IEEE FP is IEEE FP, but it seems that Intel may have cheated 
in their design, silently reducing precision for the sake of some other 
aspect of their design, making their processors less useful (or 
useless?) for scientific applications.  Another example of Intel 
arrogance?  Or perhaps a reasonable design compromise?  You decide.
