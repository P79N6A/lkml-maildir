There was a bug in ext3 which was fixed around about the 2.4.9
timeframe.  I don't know if the fix is present in that
particular Red Hat kernel.  It was fixed in ext3 0.9.8.  The
ext3 version number is displayed when you mount a filesystem.
The 0.9.8 changelog says:
- Fix an NFS oops when doing a local delete on an active, nfs-exported
  file.
I never observed this bug - I think the fix came from Ted T'so.  I
do not know whether the bug manifested itself as "busy inodes
after unmount".  Perhaps Ted or Stephen can comment?
