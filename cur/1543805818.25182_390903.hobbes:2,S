Well, nice work ! :)
Maybe a litle bit complicated if expected percpu space is 50 KB per cpu ?
Why not use a boot time allocated percpu area (as done today in 
setup_per_cpu_areas()), but instead of reserving extra space for module's 
percpu data, being able to serve alloc_percpu() from this reserved area (ie no 
kmalloced data anymore), and keeping your
#define per_cpu_ptr(ptr, cpu)  ((__typeof__(ptr))         \
	(RELOC_HIDE(ptr,  PCPU_BLKSIZE * cpu)))
Some code from kernel/module.c could be reworked to serve both as an allocator 
when a module percpudata must be relocated (insmod)/freed (rmmod), and serve 
alloc_percpu() for 'dynamic allocations'
