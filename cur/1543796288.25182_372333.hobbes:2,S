Which you still haven't proven, in fact you now seem to be changing your mind and saying that
there might be a problem if an adapter driver was implemented badly although I still don't see how
this could happen (the priority inversion I mean not the badly implemented driver ;).

When I worked with David he was very helpful. He pointed out my misconceptions and accepted my
comments that is core was missing functionality which he then added.
In fact at one time there were 3 SPI subsystems being prosposed, David's, Vitaly's and mine. David
and I work together to take the best from both which is now the solution he is proposing.
