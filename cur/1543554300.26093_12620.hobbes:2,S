I have to admit that I'm not sure what kind of dual board I got
(i have to have a closer look).
The reason is that this board is orgiginally for dual Pentium IIs.
I got two Celerons (in S370 format), and use two modified
MSI S370-to-Slot1 adaptor (aehm I hope I got this right)
cards to make the Celerons multiprocessor enabled.
I still think it is an 2.4test10 kernel issue, because
my machine won't crash (as far as I can tell) if I use
2.2.17. 
(Am I correct that 2.4test10 is a lot more fine granular threaded
 in the kernel than 2.2.17 ? 
 If this is true I suspect that there is some kind of
 race/deadlock situtation in the NFS code...
)
so long
  Ingo
