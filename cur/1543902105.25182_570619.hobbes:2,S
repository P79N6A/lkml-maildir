Hello,
I understand there are currently no active maintainers of parport and
friends - unless that has changed recently. 
We are heavy users of parport devices, and so I am offering to begin
maintaining the parport drivers. I have spent some time studying the
drivers closely, and I've read Love's book linux kernel development, so
I think I'm just about ready for this.
My question is; what are some of the outstanding issues with parport
which people would like to see addressed?
Kind Regards,
Mike Sharkey
