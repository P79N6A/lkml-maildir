Sure but maybe the default values might be altered. I think the current
tradeoff has set the cursor way too far for retries.
I remember seeing I/O error on CDs resulting in zillions of retries on
errors on USB discs resulting in resetting the USB port again & again
for hours... (CD case is years ago, but I usually see the USB layer
trying reseting for quite a long time at least once per month)
