Well, WRT your implementation, the function you add is dead code if your 
new config variable is not set, which is not desireable at all.
WRT the overall idea, I would prefer to see what Linus and Martin Mares 
(and Ivan K) thought about it, before merging it.  The x86 PCI code is 
very touchy, and your patch has the potential to change driver probe 
order for little gain.
