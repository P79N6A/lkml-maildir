Hi Everybody,
 I publicly invite all the people interested in distributed systems 
development to start working on DIPC (Distributed Inter-Process 
Communication) in any way they see fit. This could be porting DIPC to 
as-yet unsupported processors, adding features to increase its 
performance/security/availability/etc. or even using the code (or ideas) in 
other related projects.
 There can be different "flavours" of DIPC, with different trade-offs 
like using link libraries for DIPC's messages and semaphores. In this 
example, we are asking the programmer to use a link library but at the 
same time avoiding a (costly) round-trip in and out of the kernel.
 Consider it a test bed for further experiments (academical or commercial), 
and don't worry about my copyright notices in the code (but do acknowledge 
the roots! :-)
 Maybe there will be a DIPC II with much more goodies (and different 
trade-offs)
