Hello!
> I'm still wondering why the next ack isnt delayed as well, though.
Because out tcp is enough clever to understand that it made
a shit delaying ACK for previous packet. But not enough psychic
to foresee future and to avoid delay. :-)

However, we are there. :-)

.100 experiences delack timeout, which is considered as an error.
It is really error. So, tcp clears pingpong and returns to quickack.

This loop would repeat infinitely, if connection were not closed.
Kernel sees that user replies fastly, switches to canonical BSD mode
to allow ack piggibacking and tries to delay ack, but silly user does
not want to reply more. So, we have reduced amount of timeouts twice,
but this is not a big win in this case.
I am writing this mostly because it is the best demonstration
why TCP_QUICKACK:=0 is invalidated. :-)
What's about advice to use TCP_NODELAY in this case, it is _absolutely_
wrong and in fact presents violation of protocol, this app sends silly
spagetti of pakets which must be coalesced. It is exactly the situation
when TCP_NODELAY is straight bug. This app should use TCP_CORK or,
even better from the viewpoint of performance, to coalesce writes at user user
level not abusing tcp.
