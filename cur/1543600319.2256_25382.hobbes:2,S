	Well, now you have the same problem everyone else has with open source. You
can't protect yourself from the user by changing the source code because the
user has the source code. In any event, coding Linux to prevent the user
from doing something he wants to do, no matter how wrong you think that
something is, just doesn't feel right.
	I guess it's just sad that this is the issue. What stops someone from
editing the taint lines out of the bug report? Are you going to have the
kernel checksum them? *sigh*
