That is correct. DMA code does do that, but the DMA code is not used
for DBGU, and _only_ the interrupt handler of DBGU runs in
IRQF_NODELAY context (because it is part of the System-IRQ and thus
shared with the timer-irq). The DMA code always runs in IRQ-thread
context, where it is safe to block on a mutex.
So, it is not mandatory to change that also. (It may be nice to do it anyway)

Oops... 32kB on X86 is not much, relatively, on ARM it is somewhat different.
We can also decrease the total RingSize, 128 would be good enough also.
I can look at it later this week.

Beware that, according to several older discussions, DBGU cannot make
use of DMA... (If I understood it correctly, it was because the buffer
first have to be full, before an interupt is generated. That would be
very annoying while typing 1 character at the time ;-)

As mentioned, not necessarily...

Me too ;-)
