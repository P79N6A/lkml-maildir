Subject: hdparm -tT reports "suspicious results" ???

  Real-world benchmarks show I am getting about 30-32 MB/sec from my
IDE disks on 2.4.21-pre6: raid1 rebuild reports 32MB/sec and copying
a 1GB file to /dev/null on a newly-mounted fs takes 33 sec.  I have
moved the disk to another computer that is almost 100% identical
except for CPU (PPro 200 vs. PII ODP/333) and now hdparm says 24MB/sec
but I am still getting 30-32 real world on the PPro 200.  The below
results are from the PII Overdrive (I have not tested real-world
on 2.5 but notice how much slower hdparm reports its speed.)  What
does "suspicious" mean here?
# uname -a
Linux d2 2.4.21-pre6 #3 Fri Apr 4 18:22:11 EST 2003 i686 unknown
# hdparm -tT /dev/hde
/dev/hde:
 Timing buffer-cache reads:   128 MB in  2.50 seconds = 51.20 MB/sec
 Timing buffered disk reads:  64 MB in  2.15 seconds = 29.77 MB/sec
Hmm.. suspicious results: probably not enough free memory for a proper test.
