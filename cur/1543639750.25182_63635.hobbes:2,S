  Quite so.  We don't aim for 100% blocking, we can tolerate a few
  leaking thru each month.  A few each day would be too much.
  I have been monitoring what our filters do catch;  sometimes
  there are things I prefer not to be captured, which means we
  have to fine-tune the filters a bit..  I am also sometimes
  (rarely) sending a note to the message originators that their
  traffic is being captured.
  Lately I have been hammering problems with HOTMAIL - which
  internally uses some software telling "from mail pickup service"
  (or something like that), which appears also in a number of
  LOOPED messages.    I have now removed that loop-signature
  from being blocked, but I am worried...
