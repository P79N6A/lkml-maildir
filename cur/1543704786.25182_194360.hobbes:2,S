I really don't like the uglification of lib/extable.c.  I think it is
much better to have ~20 lines of code in each of arch/ia64/mm and
arch/alpha/mm than to try to generalize lib/extable.c.  Once you add
all the extra definitions you need for your version, I doubt that the
overall savings would be more than a dozen lines or so.
The point is that with lib/extable.c as it is, you can look at one
page of code, and everything you need to understand that code is
there.  With your change, I have to hunt around to check what the
macros are doing on each arch, and flip backwards and forwards to
check side effects, calling environment etc.  With an ia64-specific
extable.c, you should be able to look at one page of code there and
see that the ia64 version is also correct.
Paul.
