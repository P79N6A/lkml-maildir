If you're talking about fbcon, it does work, and not just on the
minority.

The VT subsystem happens to support single user, multi-head, period.
I did not add it, maybe Linus did, who knows. To use it though, besides
hacking the drivers, one needs to provide an interface for it. And I
have emphasized several times that I AM NOT going to provide one.
What I have done is to add a feature to enable us to unload the VT
drivers. If you are planning on replacing the current system with your
own, you will need this feature. So I'm doing you a favor.

Look, you're saying that I should only support one driver loaded at
one time.  And I'm doing it by not allowing the users to load more
than one driver at a time. To fully kill this feature, you need to
kill the source which happens to be the VT layer.
If you don't want the VT layer to support more than 1 drivers,
go ahead, rewrite the VT layer.

Again, go ahead.

Nobody is stopping you from rewriting the entire graphics subsystem
from scratch.
You can be as revolutionary with your changes as you want, but you have
to respect one very important thing, kernel to userspace compatibility.
