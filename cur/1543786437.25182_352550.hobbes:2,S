Hi Nikos,
First up, thanks for testing out my prebuild kernels.  For the
uninitiated they are snapshots of what is in the deabian kernel-team's
SVN and live in 
http://packages.vergenet.net/testing/
The problem that you see is a patch that was included in
2.4.27-11 (the current version in sid), though it isn't built
for amd64.
Could you see if the following patch works for you.  I've CCed lkml and
Marcelo for their consideration.  It seems to me that 2.4 is indeed
vulnerable to CAN-2005-0204, perhaps someone can shed some light on
this.
