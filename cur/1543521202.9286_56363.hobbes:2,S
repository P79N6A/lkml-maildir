Subject: Video problem with 2.2.14 and XFree86 3.3.5

[1.] One line summary of the problem:    
Vertical lines on screen when exiting Netscape/X/fvwm2 under 2.2.14.
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
I recently upgraded from kernel 2.2.12 to 2.2.14 and noticed a problem
when exiting from Netscape 4.7 under XFree86 3.3.5, with SVGA driver,
using the fvwm2 windows manager.  Netscape starts up fine, but on
exiting from Netscape/X/fvwm2, I get a screen full of vertical lines.
At that point, I must reboot the computer to get rid of the lines.
My usual "fixvt" command doesn't do anything.
[3.] Keywords (i.e., modules, networking, kernel):
Kernel 2.2.14
[4.] Kernel version (from /proc/version):
Linux version 2.2.14 (root@dxis) (gcc version 2.7.2.3) #1 Thu Jan 6 10:21:29 EST 2000
[5.] Output of Oops.. message (if applicable) with symbolic information 
     resolved (see Documentation/oops-tracing.txt)
N/A
[6.] A small shell script or example program which triggers the
     problem (if possible)
I use a "surf" script to start up Netscape under X, occupying the
entire screen.  Surf calls a "surf.rc" file.  Here are both files:
--------------------------(surf follows)--------------------------
#!/bin/sh
##########################

Here is the output of the X Windows SuperProbe command.  Maybe the
problem is specific to Trident cards?
