Hello,
I am running RH 6.1, kernel 2.2.12 and run into the following problem:
When I try to export a directory via NFS I get the messages:
Nov 17 10:41:55 host mountd[540] authenticated mount request from
clienthost:659 for /mnt/local (/mnt/local)
Nov 17 10:41:55 host mountd[540] getfh failed: Operation not permitted
The directory I want to export is a seperate partition which is mounted on
the server (/mnt/local). For my /mnt/home which is a seperate disk as well
it works just fine, so I am sure my setup is right.
I checked the /etc/exports file athousand times so I am sure the
permissions are correct. I also run "exportfs -r" to make sure nfsd uses
the file I am looking at.
My /etc/exports file looks like:
/mnt/home       *.mydomain(ro,no_root_squash)
/mnt/local      *.mydomain(ro,no_root_squash)
What could be the reason for this error message and why does it work for
one directory but not for another?
Any hints and tips are welcome!
Harry
