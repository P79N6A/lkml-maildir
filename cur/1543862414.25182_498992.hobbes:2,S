How many concurent threads do you use and how long does it takes to trigger 
this race? I've tried to reproduce this with two threads, but not succeed.
<thread 1>  
        fd = create("src")
        close(fd)
        unlink("src")
<thread 2>
        link("src", "dst")
        unlink("dst")
Original testcase will be the best answer :).
Thanks.
