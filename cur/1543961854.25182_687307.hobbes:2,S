	sorry, obviously you're right; if ->i_flock is null, break_lease() 
is doing the bad thing.  i've been through so many reworkings of that code 
that i'd forgotten which race was where; i came into this thread midway 
and should've reacquainted myself with the actual code in question.  my

	interesting; is this feasible?  i'd like to hear what folks think.
