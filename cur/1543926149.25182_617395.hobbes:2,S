I'm a bit confused where you're going with this. I thought the
main point of contention wasn't around the utility of the
patchset, it was around getting the actual information correct.
We've already mentioned several uses that this patchset adds:
  1. allowing managability folks to determine which physical slot
  their failing card might be sitting in (independent of hotplug
  capability).
  2. giving installers a method of presenting the physical slot
  to the user so that the user can choose to, say, do a network
  install off of the card in slot N, vs having to guess based on
  MAC address or something else unfriendly
  3. performance monitoring tools based on slot addresses/numbers
I believe that userspace cares more about those sorts of things
compared to consuming extra bytes when creating sysfs entries.

I'm kinda new to the Linux kernel, so I don't really get what
you're saying. Are you saying that the approved method of
exposing kernel information to the user via sysfs is actually
bloat? Even if that information has utility?
Feel free to educate me; I'm here to learn.
Thanks.
