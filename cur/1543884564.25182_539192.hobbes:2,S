Right. This interface was in its infancy when there were only (without 
looking to deeply) three generic IOCTLS left.
this is definitely a good point and I agree completely.

Yes. The function chaining is currently only used to validate buffer 
lists. I still believe it is
needed for that functionality, a bit depending on what we want to be 
able to change when a buffer is validated. But I can currently not see 
any other use for it in the future.

Right. This functionality is actually available in the current code, 
except that we have only one unfenced list and the fence flags indicate 
what type of flushes are needed. There's even an implementation of the 
intel sync flush mechanism in the fencing code. If the batch-buffer 
flush is omitted the driver specific flush flag is not needed and the 
fence mechanism will do a sync flush whenever needed and signal all 
previous r/w fences.
Although very nice in theory this did not work well. Particularly fbo 
applications with render-to-texture followed by a subimage update lost a 
lot of performance, and the Intel sync flush mechanism carries quite 
some latency making apps that use it very cpu-intensive, since it is 
polling-only.
Emitting a flush to the ring when needed would carry with it a lot of 
latency, although the cpu-intensity would not be that bad.
The current flush-after-all buffers default variant is simply there 
because it performs best and with the least amount of CPU usage of all 
variants I've tested. "gears" is a good example. You can take away the 
after-batchbuffer-flush and remove the DRM_I915_FENCE_FLAG_FLUSHED flag 
from intel_batchbuffer.c There's very little difference in rendering speed.
That said, gpus and different engines are very different in their need 
for flushing. I believe the current fence type interface can do what you 
are after on intel without limiting us to Intel-only 3D functionality.
Leaving Intel for a moment and looking, for example, at the Unichrome 
video- and mpeg engines, they require the fence and then a wait for 
video idle or mpeg idle (using polling) respectively.
That would work very well with the current interface and two 
driver-specific fence types. But with your model we would need two 
driver-specific unfenced list, and I'd love to get rid of the unfenced 
list for good.
So if your main concern with fencing is with rendering performance and 
not with the interface, I think the best thing is to implement and test 
your strategy with the current interface. It's definitively feasible, 
and if you see a big performance boost, lets go for it but lets also 
think of a way that suits other hardware.
Personally I'd like to focus on how we can do fencing yet still support 
nouveau-type drivers that like to do everything from user-space, and how 
to report engine errors using fence objects. These are areas where the 
current implementation is not really up to what's needed.

Yes. This or something similar is definitely the right way to go.
The submit super-ioctl is something that has been on the todo list for
quite some time. If it then also means that we can remove much of the
interface code, even better!

Hmm, yes, that's an intricate question. I suspect that the texture lock 
is actually a workaround for the deadlock you are illustrating in the 
shared texture case.
It might be possible to find schemes that work around this. One way 
could possibly be to have a buffer mapping -and validate order for 
shared buffers.
If a client tries to map shared buffers out-of-order, drm could 
automatically do an unmap - remap of  previously mapped buffers that 
would violate that order.
