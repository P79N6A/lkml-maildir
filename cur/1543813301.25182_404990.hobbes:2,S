Subject: [PATCH] Reduce sched latency in shrink_dcache_sb()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch reduces scheduling latency in shrink_dcache_sb()
noticed during remounting of big partitions with many cached dentries.
The same latency fix was applied to select_parent() long ago.
