Hmm... I don't know if you won't still need to resort to int3 and
then overwrite the byte. From my understanding it sounds like you
wouldn't but that's where Richard's insight on the errata stuff
might come in handy.
Have you actually tried to run this code by any chance? *If* it did
work, I think this might just mean that you don't need either
kprobes or djprobes.

That would seem reasonable, I think. You might want to test out
your mechanism, get confirmation from Richard and then post an
update to your patches.
