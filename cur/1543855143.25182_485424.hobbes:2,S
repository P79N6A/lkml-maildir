forgetting the fact that you're only writing 0's and that makes me 
wonder if the filesystems are cheating because the data it's writing is 
all the same, you aren't syncing that data.  You're not benchmarking the 
actual write speed, you have buffer being used still with uncommitted data.
try using iozone or something a little more stressful on the system.  
If you rerun the "benchmark" and your scores are much better (like with 
your example the second run gets 260MB/sec for me) then it's not a good 
benchmark.   It should be consistantly the same no matter how many times 
you run it.
