There is a possibility I could work on here at LLNL.  My group has
been talking about investigating Infiniband and we figured Linux would
be a good spot to start with it.  The ASCI Purple machine (100 TFLOPS)
will probably use IB for it's I/O network, though there is obviously
no commitment to is yet as this machines delivery date is a ways away.
We need to start looking at it soon so we know how well we can
integrate it into our environment.
