I must add:  Not only does this apply to 2.6.13, but it also applies to 
2.6.12 ... Can we have this put into the patch queue for 2.6.12.3 ?  
This IS a bug fix, and makes a HUGE improvement for cx88 boards.
I'd really like to see this in the mainstream kernel before the livecd 
distros make their next releases.
I would send this to Greg Kroah-Hartman / Chris Wright myself, but I 
don't know if that is proper protocol for doing this.  Andrew, please 
send this to the correct person.
Thank you.
Attached is a diff against 2.6.12.2

Changed hue offset to 128 to correct behavior in cx88 cards.  Previously, 
setting 0% or 100% hue was required to avoid blue/green people on screen.  
Now, 50% Hue means no offset, just like bt878 stuff.
