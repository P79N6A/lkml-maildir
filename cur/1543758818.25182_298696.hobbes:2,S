I was attempting to merge the asm-*/poll.h files, which I noticed were 
virtually
identical, into linux/poll.h when I noticed that several platforms, 
specifically
frv, h8300, m68k, m68knommu, mips, sparc, sparc64, and v850, all define 
the
POLLWRNORM constant to POLLOUT, while the rest define POLLWRNORM to its 
own value,
256.  Is there any reason for this difference, or is it a hack in need 
of fixing?
Cheers,
