NT has several options when the machine crashes:
- do/don't reboot
- do/don't make a dump (to the pagefile - full dump requires pagefile >= mem
+ 11MB).  You can specify a dump file name, but I think the pagefile
contents are copied there when the system reboots
- do/don't write a record to the event log file
- do/don't overwrite an existing dump (hadn't finished analysing crash A
before crash B happened - ha !)
- (my favourite) do/don't send an alert to the system operator if the dump
file is so full that there is no room for more dumps
