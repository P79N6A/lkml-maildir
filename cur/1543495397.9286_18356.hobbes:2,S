Hi.
I have add some "feature" in the kernel to remote control it's reboot.
When someone from a certain host trigger a certain port (like 24) for some times ,
the machine will reboot, I use machine_restart(NULL), But after reboot the ext2fs
will have some bad inode or so. Is there any way to do sync before reboot ?
