Ok. But actually the defaults come mainly from config.def.
The define_xxx are uset to set a symbols in some situations.
BTW for people who like the old configure (or fix it):
: if xxx
:   define_bool CONFIG_FOO
: else
:   bool CONFIG_FOO
: fi
is incorrect. You should revert the definition order
(before bool than define_bool) else xconfig will break.

With this you have a value (i.e. n,m,y).
How is the actual symbol range?
CONFIG_FOO:
  dep: (FREE? && BEER?)
how you tell configuration rools that
FOO can be only min/max of (FREE? && BEER?)

No by hand. But I can search in rules.

I mean: Do you use pythons mode to tell when a
help description end (no tab: new symbol), few spaces:
is symbol help or configuration symbols)
