And I understand the concerns. Nevertheless, the code right now, on
properly working systems and with the watchdog enabled (but not active)
results in bad NMIs to be supressed (because the code returns right
after calling nmi_watchdog_tick). I'd think that on systems as Zwane
describes one should simply not enable the watchdog (and for this reason
I continue to believe that like on i386 the default should be to have no
watchdog).
