No. The usage guidelines for MMX are explicit - you must test for the
availability and provide fallbacks. If code doesn't work on a box without
MMX and provides no option to do so then as far as the MMX programming guides
go - its broken.
Similarly the right answer for the Loki game is probably to build it with
different compiler options, not to stick some emulator in the kernel
