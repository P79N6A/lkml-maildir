No, there are too many already. Try the MacOS or BSD scheme.
Soon we will need to reverse engineer the Windows 2000 scheme.
(note that it might only be available with new hardware)

If you must... Take 64 kB at both beginning and end of every
partition. (for safety and filesystem compatibility, don't let the
data be part of the partition as viewed in /dev) Use a circular doubly
linked list with checksums, versioned updates, 128-bit magic numbers,
and duplicate data in the neighboring partitions.

Yes. It was fast and easy. It worked OK with the old fdisk.
