This brings up something I've been thinking about.  Aren't the
sleep_on macros basically useless, since they almost always have a
small window for a race condition?
	CPU 0					CPU 1 (or an interrupt)
	lock()					unlock()
	{					{
	    while (test_and_set(&is_busy))
						    clear(&is_busy)
						    wake_up(&wq);
		/* goes to sleep */
	        sleep_on(&wq);
	}					}
Putting a cli/sti around the whole thing will protect it against
interrupt races, but that still leaves SMP systems vulnerable.
Isn't the only proper way something like this?:
	lock()
	{
	    struct wait_queue wait = { current, NULL };
	    add_to_waitqueue(&wq);
	    /* set the task state to interruptible before doing the test */
            current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	    while (test_and_set(&is_busy))
	    {
		/* if wake up is here now, schedule will return
		   almost immediately */
		schedule();
                current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
	    }
            current->state = TASK_RUNNING;
	    remove_from_waitqueue(&wq);
	}
Or am I missing something?
