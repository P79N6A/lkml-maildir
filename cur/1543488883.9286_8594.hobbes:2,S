Well, the driver is allocating some memory at mmap() time and maps
it to userspace (its not really file memory and there was (before the
patch) no file pointer associated with the vma). This memory gets
freed at close() time (as the driver cannot catch munmaps) - and
the close() gets delayed only, if there is a file with the vma
(and the use count properly updated).
This is the way I understand the world. file-release() will gain
me nothing!?
