I was looking in MAINTAINERS, and you weren't listed on the main MTD section
as a maintainer.  Perhaps an update?
If you get a patch, I'd love to test it.

Yup, that's what I figured.  I'll keep this ugly hack but I won't push it to
my unionfs tree on kernel.org.

The problem appears to be an interaction of two components--module loading
and lockdep--that's perhaps why it wasn't given enough attention.
I run a lot of regression tests w/ unionfs on top of many different file
systems, and monitoring for all sorts of problems, including lockdep
warnings.  So it's frustrating that each time I get to test w/ jffs2, I get
this lockdep warning, and lockdep shuts down until a reboot.  That kills my
automated testing and masks out possible other lockdep problems (that's why
I wanted to at least have some workaround).  Other lockdep problems I
reported with other subsystems had been fixed within days; this one,
unfortunately, has lingered for a while.  So if a fix can be made in a
reasonable time-frame, I'd really appreciate it.
Thanks,
Erez.
