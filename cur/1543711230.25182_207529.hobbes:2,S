I'm ran 2.6.4-mm2 plus the 2 wait_on_page_range() patches,
the test_set_page_writeback() patch and clear_page_dirty_for_io patch
overnight.
6 copies of direct_read_under test on 8-cpu system on 1
ext3 file system in 1 directory on a scsi disk.
(

)
5 of the 6 tests saw uninitialized data within 2 hours.
The sixth test ran overnight.
