This is what I did to get it under quilt. (Then, patches directory
should be put under CVS and replace what we have in the CVS now).
root@amd:/usr/src# cp -a clean.2.5/ linux-mm
root@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm# exit
pavel@amd:/usr/src$ cd linux-mm
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ mkdir patches
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ mkdir txt
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ mkdir .pc
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ quilt import -n core-lite ~/sf/kgdb-2/core-lite.patch
Importing patch core-lite (stored as patches/core-lite)
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ quilt import -n i386-lite ~/sf/kgdb-2/i386-lite.patch
Importing patch i386-lite (stored as patches/i386-lite)
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ quilt import -n 8250 ~/sf/kgdb-2/8250.patch
Importing patch 8250 (stored as patches/8250)
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ quilt import -n x86_64 ~/sf/kgdb-2/x86_64.patch
Importing patch x86_64 (stored as patches/x86_64)
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ quilt import -n ppc ~/sf/kgdb-2/ppc.patch
Importing patch ppc (stored as patches/ppc)
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ quilt import -n core ~/sf/kgdb-2/core.patch
Importing patch core (stored as patches/core)
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ quilt import -n i386 ~/sf/kgdb-2/i386.patch
Importing patch i386 (stored as patches/i386)
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ quilt import -n eth ~/sf/kgdb-2/eth.patch
Importing patch eth (stored as patches/eth)
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$
At this point project is controlled with quilt. If I do 
pavel@amd:/usr/src/linux-mm$ quilt push 5
Applying eth
...
It applies all -lite patches and non-conflicting patches. I can modify
them as I wish. At the end I need to do quilt refresh <whatever patch
I changed>.
If I wanted my changes to go into the non-lite version, instead, I'd
have to begin with quilt push 7.

Well, I took a look at the web page, but could not find all the
kgdb-related changes easily...
