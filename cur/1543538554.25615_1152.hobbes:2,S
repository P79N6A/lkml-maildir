I guess it would make more sense to go with the SGI PDA patch 
(per process data, cluster all per CPU data in a single structure
that is assigned to a current field in the scheduler)
This saves a lot more space by avoiding lots of cache line alignments
and code space (shorter code to access it). And it has about the same
disastrous consequences to module binary compatibility as your patch.
So when you eat that, why not go the full way ?
Also btw a lot of machines has discontinuous processor numbers.
