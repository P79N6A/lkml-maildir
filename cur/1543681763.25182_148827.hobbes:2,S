This is basically because the check for lost bytes wasn't present in
2.4. Now that it is there, it works well with real lost bytes, but will
fire also in case when the mouse interrupt was delayed for more than
half a second, or if indeed a mouse interrupt gets lost. The 2.5 kernel
by default programs the mouse to high speed reporting (up to 200 updates
per second). This may, possibly make the problem show up easier. There
might be real lost bytes on some machines, too. This can be checked by
defining DEBUG in i8042.c
