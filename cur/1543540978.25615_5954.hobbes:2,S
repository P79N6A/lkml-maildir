If I understood Linda correctly, there is magic, because (the access to) the resulting
"." is resolved at chdir time, not at access time. Therefore access should succeed even
when chdir()ing, not chrooting(). And also according to Linda, open() could succeed,
because (the access to) the new "/" is resolved at chroot time (and not access time),
too. So who's right? (I agree that there is a misunderstanding, but I still cannot see
who is wrong with what opinion. :-))

You know that checking the previous directory also implies checking the parent of this
directory, and this directories parent.? I agree that the permission model is simple,
but you see that it can become quite complicated to resolve accessibility to an fs
object from a particular user. (Because accessibility does and does not depend on the
accessibility of the parent, depening on how you try to access.) Maybe ACLs will give
you the possibility to instant-resolve every ACL to every fs object "ls" is listing. (So
you won't have to check reachability through the parents, because this reachability is
already calculated when printing ACLs..)

Currently, I'm in favour of Ted's "I want the question wether to allow or deny access
answered immediately."-attitude. I just do not think that this inevitably means that we
need to end up with static ACLs and their disadvantages. (Maybe my opinion changes when
Hans "unveils" his fast, yet inheriting ACL approach.)
