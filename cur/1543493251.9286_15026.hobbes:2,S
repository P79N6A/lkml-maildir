Actually, no - the buffer doesn't change.  Also, it's slowed (or stopped) 
frequency recently.  I hardly ever see it any more.  Still strange, though.
Hmmm (snaps fingers) actually - I used to try to overclock my 333 to 400, but 
it's one of the Celerons that doesn't overclock easily, but I left the 
settings on the motherboard for a 400 mHz CPU.  I just recently changed the 
settings back, since I couldn't figure out a way to trick the chip.  About 
then is the last time I saw the error.  Could that have something to do with 
it, or is it probably just a coincidence?
Thanks for the reply (and sorry for the lateness of mine - I've been away from 
e-mail for almost a week).
