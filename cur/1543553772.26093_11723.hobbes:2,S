I think you're right.  eepro100 and acenic seriously care about 2.2-compatibility
but AFAICT the others just pretend to.

mm..  Seeing as failure to set dev->owner is a fatal mistake,
it would be good to enforce this via the compiler type system.
How about making THIS_MODULE an argument to register_netdevice()
and, hence, register_netdev() and init_etherdev()?
