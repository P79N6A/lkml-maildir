Subject: 2.4.x boot problems.

I have a sony Vaio sr7k. The boot hangs after the 'starting sendmail'
line. Previously I was not having this problem. Even if I try to boot
kernels that worked before it hangs.
This is a PIII running slackware 7.0 mostly current.
I can supply more info if necessary. But I would certainly like to get
this thing working, some of the features only work w/2.4.x.
Thanks,
