 Actually it is two files:
 	firmware_class.c:
		the code itself
	firmware_sample_driver.c:
		sample code for driver writers.
 If you don't like having firmware_sample_driver.c there, it could be
 moved to Documentation/ or put in some web page.
 Thanks

Let us have the serenity to accept the things we cannot change, courage to
