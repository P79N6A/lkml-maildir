Since this is becoming more an IDE/ATA issue, I added
linux-ide@vger.kernel.org to CC. I hope that's the right mailinglist.

I kindof had suspected that. The docking station has an ultrabay slot
where I currently have a cdrom drive (since the notebook itself doesn't
have any cdrom drive. Once I took the cdrom drive out, I was able to
successfully perform what I wanted to do in points 3a and 5!
The 'undock' button probably doesn't tell the kernel that it should
unload the cdrom driver. Even though after pressing the undock button
the drive becomes unusable (the green led that is on the side of the
ultrabay disables and it's impossible to open the tray). Though pressing
the undock button causes the usb ports to be removed from the kernel, at
least that's what dmesg suggests (I put the notebook into the dock,
waited a bit and then pressed the undock button):
usb 1-4: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 11
usb 1-4: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
hub 1-4:1.0: USB hub found
hub 1-4:1.0: 4 ports detected
ACPI: \_SB_.GDCK - docking
ACPI: \_SB_.GDCK - undocking
usb 1-4: USB disconnect, address 11
The notebook+dock+STR works as long as the notebook doesn't know about
the ultrabay device. That can be because the notebook was started
outside of the docking station, or inside the docking station but with
the ultrabay removed. But once the notebook sees the ultrabay device
it's over. As little as one suspend/resume cycle inside the docking
station and with a ultrabay device plugged in is enough to make the
kernel (partially) recognize the device - the kernel doesn't recognize
the device as a cdrom drive, but only as an UDMA/33 device. After one
suspend/resume cycle I see this in dmesg:
ata4.00: ACPI cmd ef/03:45:00:00:00:a0 failed (Emask=0x1 Stat=0x51 Err=0x04)
ata4: failed to recover some devices, retrying in 5 secs
Coming out of suspend...
[... snip ...]
ata4.00: ACPI cmd ef/03:45:00:00:00:a0 failed (Emask=0x1 Stat=0x51 Err=0x04)
ata4.00: ACPI on devcfg failed the second time, disabling (errno=-5)
ata4.00: revalidation failed (errno=1)
ata4: failed to recover some devices, retrying in 5 secs
ata4.00: configured for UDMA/33
And after that I can't resume outside of the docking station. So the
description of point 3 was incomplete, sorry about that.
At least the two failures 3a and 5 can be explained...
