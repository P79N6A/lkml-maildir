Actually, anything over 896 or so MB is considered High Mem.  Don't ask me
why.  I didn't write the code.  If I did, I would have used a nice round
number.
IN OTHER WORDS, TURN HIGH MEM SUPPORT BACK ON!
Now, this part is just my guess, but try compiling the kernel for 586-smp
instead of a 686-smp.  IMHO, the documentation isn't really clear about
exactly which processor crosses the threshold, and Intel's naming convention
doesn't help either.
But I could be wrong.
