I have a strange problem with 2.2.0 that *may* be caused by the same
off-by-one bug, but again, it may not.  On a UP machine at work, I
have a number of binaries (all compiled with shared MesaGL) that
segfault immediately on 2.2.0 and work on 2.0.{33,36}.  Strace
shows only *one* system call (mmap), and then immediately segfault.
Important note: Ingo's patch does *not* change this behavior.
Again, this may be not kernel related at all, could be another problem
just triggered by the kernel version...
