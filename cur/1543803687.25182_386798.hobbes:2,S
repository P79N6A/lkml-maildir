Yes, I think we could embed the s2ram preparation in the suspending
application, and program it to operate like that:
1) freeze
2) call atomic snapshot
3) save the image
4) prepare s2ram
5) suspend to RAM
6) sleep
7) wake up (this would unfreeze processes too, if successful)
8) zap the image header
This would play some ping-pong with devices that would be suspended,
woken up and then suspended again before s2ram, but I don't think that's
avoidable in the current state of things.
Greetings,
Rafael
