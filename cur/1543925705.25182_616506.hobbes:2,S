Yeah, OK, that's another one for my list of compound processing problems
to worry about.  (Others:
	- a deferral for an export upcall can similarly lead to
	  incorrect behavior on nonidempotent operations; if we could
	  fix this we could also eliminate the nfs4idmap.c special case,
	  which would probably enable some other cleanup.  I've made a
	  couple half-hearted attempts to fix this but don't have
	  anything finished yet.
	- We've still got the reply cache turned off for nfsv4!  I think
	  it was originally turned off just because whoever did it
	  didn't want to figure out which compounds to cache.  That's
	  probably not hard to fix, but last I checked I didn't think
	  our reply cache actually helped much in the tcp case (the only
	  case we care about).  So that needs to be fixed first.  I've
	  done no work on this yet.
