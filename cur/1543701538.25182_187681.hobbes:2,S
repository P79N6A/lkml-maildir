Ah there you go, then it's just the missing cast to u64. It has nothing
to do with current->comm at all. The compiler should have warned you
about this error, did it not?
The dump printk() needs to be changed anyways, the rw deciphering is not
correct. Something like this is more appropriate:
	if (unlikely(block_dump)) {
		char b[BDEVNAME_SIZE];
		printk("%s(%d): %s block %Lu on %s\n", current->comm,
			current->pid, (rw & WRITE) ? "WRITE" : "READ",
			(u64) bio->bi_sector, bdevname(bio->bi_bdev, b));
	}
