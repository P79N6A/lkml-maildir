The BeOS file system has a directory inode pointer within it's inode
structure definition.  The unused parts of the inode end being used
as a high speed property/attribute list, while the directory inode
pointer thing is use for the attribute overflow.
It's quite nifty and is useful for stuff like making a strong MIME type
determination without any regard to the unclarity of using file suffixes.
It's a winner for me.
