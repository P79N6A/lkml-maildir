Yech! Apart from the fact that this means you do a full fdatasync()
even when you are simply trying to flush out single pages,
nfs_sync_file() gets called all over the place including in areas
where we know we're already holding a page lock.
AFAICs this fix will clearly deadlock...
Could you instead detail exactly which corruption problem you are
trying to fix?
Cheers,
