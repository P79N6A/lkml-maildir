Sort of.  Remember, we discussed markers as *marking* places and
things, with the intent that they be decoupled from the actual
*action* that is taken when the marker is hit.

Compare the kind of marker I showed at OLS and presently supported by
systemtap.  Its unparametrized version looks like this:
#define STAP_MARK(name) do { \
   static void (*__mark_##name##_)(); \
   if (unlikely (__mark_##name##_)) \
   (void) (__mark_##name##_()); \
} while (0)
A tracing/probing tool would hook up to a particular and specific
marker at run time by locating the __mark_NAME static variable (a
function pointer) in the data segment, for example using the ordinary
symbol table, and swapping into it the address of a compatible
back-end handler function.  When a particular tracing/probing session
ends, the function pointer is reset to null.
Note that this technique:
- operates at run time
- is portable
- in its parametrized variants, is type-safe
- does not require any future technology
- does impose some overhead even when a marker is not active
