I still don't get it where the superblock comes in.  The locking is
"interesting" in there, yes.  And I haven't completely convinced
myself it's right, let alone something that won't easily be screwed up
in the future.  So there's definitely room for thought there.
But how does it matter if two different paths have the same sb or a
different sb mounted over them?

The same dentry is mounted over each one.  The contents of the
directory should only depend on the contents of the underlying inode.
The path leading up to it is completely irrelevant.
