I added that patch to my bk trees, and it's sitting in the -mm tree now.
I wanted some testing, which I guess has happened, and no one has
complained yet, so if this proves to be another case where this patch
fixes things, I have no problem with it being applied.
But let's see the result of testing on this box first :)
thanks,
