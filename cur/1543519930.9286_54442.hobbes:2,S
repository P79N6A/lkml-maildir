You've just managed to make the probability of pipe creation failing raise
by a non-trivial amount because you're allocating an order 1 page instead
of order zero.  I'd strongly suggest making the pipe buffers remain the
size of 1 page and allocate them dynamically.  This goes towards another
pipe optimization that has been suggested: where possible, one could flip
a full page into the reader's address space rather than copying, making
for a substantial gain in pipe bandwidth.
