The mindcraft folks did build with -DSINGLE_LISTEN_UNSERIALIZED_ACCEPT
(you stick it into the CFLAGS environment variable before invoking
./configure).  My guess is that you'll see the same results. 
I suspect that with accept() or fcntl() we'll need an option to enable the
wake_one() behaviour -- otherwise it's a pain to deal with process
priorities and such.  Essentially a flag which says "all processes waiting
on this are of equal priority, no matter what their cpu time, when their
last time slice was, blah blah blah".  (And then the kernel should wake
the one which went to sleep most recently ;)
