Thanks for the information.  Hm, that seems a bit big for what I want to do,
but might be workable.
Oh, and to compare sizes, with udev linked against klibc (static link)
it comes out to a whopping big 6004 bytes:
$ size udev
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   5572       4     392    5968    1750 udev
thanks,
