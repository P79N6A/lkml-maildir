That would be useful, but OTOH I'd rather not like PM_DEBUG to select multiple
tracing options.  Perhaps it's better to add PM_CHECK_IRQS or something similar
and make that depend on PM_DEBUG and whatever else is necessary.

I didn't think about that.
I see a value of having this kind of things trigger a warning, but also I see
a value of having some checks in the code, independent of any extra debug
options.
