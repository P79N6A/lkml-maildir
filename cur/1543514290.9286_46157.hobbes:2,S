I got a bunch of these last night on an unpatched copy of 2.2.13. 
Several CVS copies, an egcs build, and 'bzcat|tar xf-' were all running
in the background, so the single 4GB disk was getting hit pretty hard,
in addition to NFS and knfsd.  Hardware is K6 350,

After getting 30-50 of these all at once, no new messages have appeared.
