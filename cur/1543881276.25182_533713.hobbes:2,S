Use TLB batching for MADV_FREE.  Adds another 10-15% extra performance
to the MySQL sysbench results on my quad core system.

It's similar to trying to access memory during an munmap.
You may be able to for a short time, but it'll come back to
haunt you.

Even then we do.  Each invocation of zap_pte_range() only touches
one page table page, and it flushes the TLB before releasing the
page table lock.

All the tlb flush code seems to assume is that the tlb entries
should be invalidated.

Jakub found a potential bug, in that I did not use an atomic
operation to clear the page table entries.  I've attached a
new patch which simply uses ptep_test_and_clear_dirty/young
to get rid of the dirty and accessed bits.
It uses the same atomic accesses we use elsewhere in the VM
and the code is a line shorter than before.
Andrew, please use this one.
