> Why can a #! script only have 1 argument?
If you have a script called bar, that starts with
     #!/some/path/foo lots of arguments
and the script is invoked using
     /some/other/path/bar x y z
then the program /some/path/foo is called with six arguments:
     0: "foo"
     1: "lots of arguments"
     2: "/some/other/path/bar"
     3: "x"
     4: "y"
     5: "z"

POSIX does not specify what should happen.

The Unices I just checked (SunOS 4.1.4, SunOS 5.6, IRIX 6.2, Linux)
agree on the arguments after the first two.
Linux is the only one that starts with "foo" - the others start with
the full "/some/path/foo".
Concerning the most interesting part, argument 1, all agree that it is
absent when there are no parameters on the #! line.
SunOS 4.1.4 truncates the #! line after 32 bytes and has
     1: "lots of argumen"
SunOS 5.6 cuts at the space and has
     1: "lots"
IRIX 6.2 agrees with Linux.
No doubt others will report on other systems.
So, for invocations that require more than one argument we may
have to use #!/bin/sh followed by the perl invocation on the next line.
