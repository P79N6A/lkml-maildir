On my powerbook, the pcmcia/cardbus controller has one interrupt,
which is used both for card status changes and for card functional
interrupts.  It doesn't have an ISA bus and it doesn't have an 8259
interrupt controller, and interrupts 0-15 aren't anything like what
they might be on a PC.  This is why (as Ben says) there is no point
probing for interrupts, and why on ppc (or at least on powermacs) the
probe functions are no-ops.
