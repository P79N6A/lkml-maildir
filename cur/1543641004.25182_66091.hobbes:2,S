The first should be to identify where the problem is. For example, run a
"vmstat 1" during the test to see if something looks unreasonable. At 25
Mbps bidirectional with a packet size of 64 bytes, there are nearly
50000 packets coming in and another 50000 going out. If there is an
interrupt for each packet sent/received (don't seem to be the case, at
least checking default module parameters for eepro100) you system will
have to deal with up to 100000 interrupts/second, quite a lot for a slow
system.
Hope it (somehow) helps :)
