To be fair to gcc, no Intel P6 or above to date has shipped
without CMOV.

K7s and P5s (and 486s too if I remember correctly) strongly prefer
code entry points and loop labels to be 16-byte aligned. This is
due to the way code is fetched from L1.

Most pre-MMX P5s have a bug which breaks back-to-back writes to
the local APIC space (P5 erratum 11AP), requiring the kernel to
insert a dummy read before each local APIC write. GOOD_APIC is
for P5MMX and above which don't have this bug.
I have a P5 chip with this erratum I sometimes use for testing
(since it's pre-MMX and thus pre-RDPMC), and I know of people
still using dual P5 boxes with these early chips.
