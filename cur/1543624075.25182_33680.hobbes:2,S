OK, so it's clearly unrelated.

Clearing dumpable at this point is obviously wrong as it always has
side-effects on the process that was leading into the module request.
It's also unnecessary, as it /only/ has effect on the /old/ mm_struct,
before doing the execve() of the usermode helper. As request_module
and friends don't introduce sensitive data into the address space of
the calling process, leaving dumpable alone is just fine.
So, IMO, set_user(0, 0) should be the way to go.
