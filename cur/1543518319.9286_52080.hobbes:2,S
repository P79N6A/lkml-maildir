Subject: measure time less than 1 jiffie?

Hi all,
    I am trying to measure the timings of some kernel routines. I examined
the value of 'jiffies' for that. But many routines (almost all, including
the major ones like fork, exit and exec) return before a jiffie expires,
which is understandable. (because 1 jiffie is 10ms). Therefore i am unable
to get the exact timings.
Can someone tell me how to measure the timings, inside the kernel, which
are less than 1 jiffie (in microseconds). I am running linux-2.2.9 kernel.
Thanks,
Sushil.
