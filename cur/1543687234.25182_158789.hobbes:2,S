	If only it was so! I have direct practical experience that under
LinuxThreads, at least, it doesn't. SuSv3 allows _exit to flush open streams
and remove temporary files. Sadly, _exit, on many systems, acquire locks or
accesses process structures that might be corrupt whereas dereferencing a
NULL pointer does not.
	I have portable code that has a 'terminate this process immediately'
function. It started out calling '_exit' until we found platforms where that
resulted in a hang (say the thread calling _exit holds a non-recursive mutex
that the _exit function tries to acquire). So we kept inching our way up to
more and more extreme termination methods.
