Why can't the splitting happen incrementally?
Assume you have a header include/linux/foo.h:
- Add an #include <kabi/linux/foo.h> at the top.
- Move the part of the contents that is part of the userspace ABI to 
  include/kabi/linux/foo.h.
When this is done for all headers containing parts of the userspace ABI:
- test the kabi/ headers in userspace
- review all headers under kabi/ since what's there will become a fixed
  ABI that can never be changed
- test the kabi/ headers in userspace
- make the ABI headers official
For kernel code, this header splitting should be completely transparent
(and nothing outside include/ should directly include headers under 
include/kabi/).
For userspace, this will be one switch from the many different header 
packages floating around to the new ABI headers, but it should break 
nearly none usespace applications (it will break some abuses, but
that's OK).
