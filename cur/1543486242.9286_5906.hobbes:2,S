Well I meant `route del...`

I think it's just a BUG plain and simple........
        if((s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, proto->p_proto)) != -1)
        {
            memset(&rt, 0x00, sizeof(rt));
            rt.rt_metric = METRIC;
            rt.rt_mss    = MTU;
            rt.rt_irtt   = 255;
            rt.rt_flags  = RTF_GATEWAY | RTF_UP | RTF_MSS;
            rt.rt_dst.sa_family = AF_INET;
            rt.rt_gateway.sa_family = AF_INET;
            rt.rt_genmask.sa_family = AF_INET;
            memset(&rt.rt_genmask.sa_data[2], 0xff, 0x03);
            makeaddr(ADDR(rt.rt_dst), network);
            makeaddr(ADDR(rt.rt_gateway), gateway);
            (void)ioctl(s, SIOCDELRT, &rt); <---- Temp fix
            (void)ioctl(s, SIOCDELRT, &rt); <---- Temp fix
            (void)ioctl(s, SIOCADDRT, &rt); <---- Temp fix
        }
...or
while  route -n | egrep ${MASK} >/dev/null ;
do
  route del -net ${NET} netmask ${MASK} dev ${DEV}
done
route add -net ${NET} netmask ${MASK} dev ${DEV}
These are BUG work-arounds.

Heuistics always produce more problems than they solve.
The fix is:
            ioctl(s, SIOCDELRT, &rt);
...must delete the route, not (a, some, or first) routing table
entry. Once the function-call works correctly, everything will
be fine.
