this might be changed/impacted by the parent-requeue fix that is in the 
updated (for real, promise! ;) patch. Right now on CFS a forking parent 
shares its own run stats with the child 50%/50%. This means that heavy 
forkers are indeed penalized. Another logical choice would be 100%/0%: a 
child has to earn its own right.
i kept the 50%/50% rule from the old scheduler, but maybe it's a more 
pristine (and smaller/faster) approach to just not give new children any 
stats history to begin with. I've implemented an add-on patch that 
implements this, you can find it at:

cool and thanks for the feedback! (Btw., as another test you could also 
try to renice "scheddos" to +19. While that does not push the scheduler 
nearly as hard as nice 0, it is perhaps more indicative of how a truly 
abusive many-tasks workload would be run in practice.)
