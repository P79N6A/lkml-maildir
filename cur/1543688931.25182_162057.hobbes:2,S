As you said, you are not using kernel/power.

Good. [I believe it was big enough to require testing on separate tree
(-mm? -ac?) before going mainline].

I only see dm getting more and more complicated :-(.

kernel/power/* changes are worst, because that's subsystem I should be
maintainer of. Driver model changes are quite bad, too, because they
mean we should go over all drivers and fix them. And driver failures
are often pretty subtle.

I'm not looking forward to another half-a-year before kernel gets into
state where it was in -test3.
I still want that crap killed, at least because of the way *how* it
was merged. Altrough killing kernel/power/* would be good start, and
maybe it would lead us to a state where dm changes can be debugged.
