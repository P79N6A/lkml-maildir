	hrm, not to get into a disk war, but I've had good luck w/ IBM disks
in the past.  Are the seagate disks in a different machine?  I mean, if it's
that all the disks in one machine keep going bad, there might be other
problems w/ that machine.  If the seagate's are in the same machine, then I'd
have to say you seem very unlucky. :)  If not, then perhaps there is a
problem w/ the power supply or cooling or something in the machine where the
disks keep dieing?
