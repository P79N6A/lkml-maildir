Subject: synaptics touchpad not working with 2.4.x

I;ve had this with 2.4.0 but have just tried with 2.4.6ac2 and still
have it.
Under 2.2.x the touchpad works like a dream. Under 2.4.x it stutters,
freezes and so on. Did something about /dec/psaux change between 2.2.x
and 2.4.x? Will I need to recompile glibc and/or gpm?
if I cat /dev/psaux I get data flowing through but gpm stays frozen. :/
Hope someone can help as, now that ext3 is being well and truly ported 
to 2.4.x, this is the last stumbling block for me having 2.4.x on
my laptop.
gpm options: /usr/sbin/gpm -m /dev/psaux -t synps2 -Rmsc -2
glibc: 2.1.3 compiled for 2.2.x
