That wouldn't fill my definition for "heavy", but as it is a race
somewhere, it can happen undr many circumstances, I guess.

Well, I do use reiserfs->aes-loop->lvm/dm->md5/raid5, and it never failed
for me, except once, and the error is likely to be outside reiserfs, and
possibly outside lvm.
However, your case *is* different, as corruption wasn't permament for me,
so chances are that you are hitting sth. else.
Of course, many people find 2.6 too unstable for production use (remember
2.4.x, it was the same), and the most important rule is: if it fails for
you, it's a showstopper.
Also, mild corruption is likely to be more disastrous to reiserfs as it
uses a much denser representation on disk (in other words: it uses space
more efficiently, but that comes at the price of redundancy).
