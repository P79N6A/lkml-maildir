Hi, I received an error message today while running the following
make menuconfig
    make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
make dep ; make clean
    /usr/src/linux-2.0.34/.hdepend:665:missing seperator. stop ( this I got
rid of by editing the file .hdepend )
so then I ran
make config
make dep ; make clean
make zImage
    after make zImage I got
            make[ 2 ] :***[ vmlinux ] Error 1
            make[ 2 ] : Leaving directory
'/usr/src/linux-2.0.34/arch/i386/boot/compressed
            make[ 1 ] : ***[ compressed/vmlinux ] Error 2
            make[ 1 ] : Leaving directory
'/usr/src/linux-2.0.34/arch/i386/boot
            make : *** [ zImage ] Error 2
That is it.  Now here is what I think I did.  I wanted to install AfterStep
window-manager from my Slackware CD.  I followed everything the book said.
        --use the CD to log in and mount my Linux filesystem and then use
pkgtool to make my changes.  Well everything I tried ( with pkgtool )
did not work.  So I ( fairly new to Linux ) tried to use cp and mv to get
the packages where I wanted them.  I think I have the whole CD on my drive
now.  When I run 'fdisk -l' on my Windozz drive it shows the following
 after the normal info of cource)
    Device        Boot        Begin        Start        End        Blocks
Id        System
    /dev/hda5        ?        183863    184039    1334131740832355        e7
unknown
Now I cannot save any editing of any kind.  I get a swap error message that
says the filesystem is full.  Also this morning while following the books
directions I ran 'make modules'  and 'make modules_install' . So either the
modules are filling everything up or the CD ?? It is a small drive so it was
easily filled.
Well thanks for any help or if I should not be bothering you with this
extended info, I am sorry
