Yeah, that looks like a pretty sane scheme.  Do we want to be any more
abstract about it?  Perhaps instead of USER_SLAB, it should be
USER_KERNEL_INTERNAL, or USER_KERNEL_USE.  The slab itself is going away
as we speak. :)

We could also Yeah, that looks like a pretty sane scheme.  Do we want to

For the bits that we want to export, we could also add the unoptimized
access functions for any that don't already have them:
#define __ClearPageReserved(page)       __clear_bit(PG_reserved, &(page)->flags)
Anybody changing bit behavior will certainly go check all of the
callers, such as ClearPageReserved() *and* __ClearPageReserved().
