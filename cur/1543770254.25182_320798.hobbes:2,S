Why not change the atomic into a lock and a refcount.  Grab the lock before
each increment/decrement of the refcount and only continue with the removal
code when the refcount reaches 0.  For a normal cpuset, the refcount could
be biased to 1.  Then child cpusets are created, they could increment their
parent cpuset's refcount.  When the notify_on_release flag used to be set,
we decrement the refcount by one.  Whenever the refcount reaches 0, we
automatically remove the cpuset.  Seems really clear, but would require
touching a larger chunk of the code.
