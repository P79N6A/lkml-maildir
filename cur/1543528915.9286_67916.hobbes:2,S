	Hello,
	during my working on the syncppp.c modifications I tried
to dig into the way input packets are processed. I have two questions
about the struct packet_type, and its input processing function
- the struct packet_type.func(), which is defined as follows (in
<linux/netdevice.h>):
int (*func) (struct sk_buff *, struct net_device *, struct packet_type *);
The first question is - what is this function expected to return?
Most instances of this function simply returns zero. This function
is called from several places in linux/net/core/dev.c, but the return value
is ignored.
And the second one: What is the third parameter for? It seems it is
always called with the struct packet_type * corresponding to
skb->protocol. Syncppp and ipv4 do not use this parameter (according
to quick look at the source code, I might have missed something).
	Thanks,
-Yenya

 Its purely bandwidth.  If it was 40 instances of Miguel reading web pages
flat out over 100baseT you would definitely be right. But its not...  (Alan)
