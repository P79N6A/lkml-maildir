Hi,
I get sometimes these kind of errors reading continously from CDs:
Nov 26 13:38:09 wl-193 kernel: hda: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x24
Nov 26 13:38:19 wl-193 kernel: hda: DMA interrupt recovery
Nov 26 13:38:19 wl-193 kernel: hda: lost interrupt
and
Nov 26 16:16:50 wl-193 kernel: hdc: DMA interrupt recovery
Nov 26 16:16:50 wl-193 kernel: hdc: lost interrupt
This happens when I use Xine playing AVIs from CDs.
When it happens, it happens frequently, like once in every 5-10 minutes.
When I play an SVCD then it's less frequent than on data CDs,
like once in 30 minutes.
Drive is:
hdc: LITE-ON COMBO LTC-48161H, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive
I haven't seen these kind of errors on my previous FC1/i386 system with
2.6.x kernels, I installed FC3/x86-64 recently. The original and the
second errata kernel both show this errors.
I also don't get this error on my harddisk.
Best regards,
Zoltán Böszörményi
