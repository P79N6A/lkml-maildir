You have to build -optional- interfaces. Instead of thinking about a layer
above the drivers think about a layer of support code _below_ the drivers
that can be shared and used when it fits. Now drivers that have odd needs
can skip pieces that dont fit. With a conventional view of layering they
end up fighting a pile of crap above them that does things they dont want
and eventually all the people trying to bend the layer above different ways
break it
