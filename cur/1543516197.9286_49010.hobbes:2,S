You are absolutely correct in all cases. I am using VMWare for some tasks
that I need to perform certain tasks, and it is quite amusing to have
Windows bluescreen in a window and just click "reboot" and it does (one of
the tasks I need to perform is bug testing certain software, so VMware
comes in handy.)
The trouble I see for VMWare in some environments (where users don't CARE
what they use, as long as it RUNS) is that for using VMware you will have
to boot up TWO systems concurrently (that is a time delay), and the
performance, while being good on my 350MHz K6-2, is - at least in my
experience - not acceptable if you run anything under 266MHz. It was
certainly not acceptable on the Pentium 233 pool of machines I was
upgrading to Linux lately (although they had ample RAM).
What I want in VMware is a virtual "suspend to disk" feature, that just
sets the virtual CPU to 0MHz and writes the memory contents in a disk file.
That way, you do not need to boot your virtual OS every time, and it saves
a lot of time.
Yeah, I'll shut up now.
