Larger soft pages waste tremendous amounts of memory (mostly in page
cache) for minimal benefit on, say, the typical desktop. While there
are workloads where it's a win, it's probably on a small percentage of
machines.
So it's absolutely no help in fixing our order-1 allocation problem
because we don't want to force large pages on people.
