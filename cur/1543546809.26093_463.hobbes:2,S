Greetings,
There will be a future release of Tag Command Queuing for testing.
At this point it compiles and boots, but must be invoked.
q->plugged is different, and needs some work.
It at least boots.....
Oh and this requires the rejected taskfile patch which is included.
So if you want the newest features:
	Tag Command Queuing
	Acoustic Management
	48-bit LBA (drives larger than 137GB)
	AV Streaming
	SerialATA
	Cascade w/ disconnect.
You are required to use a correct data-phase rules, period.
Just so you know the full taskfile will minimize the time it takes for you
to royally root-yourself.  Trust that if you have a root-issue, I do not
want you to waste any time having to bit-bang to dork your system.
Just override the data-phase rules (option to be include) and begin to
self-procreate!
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
