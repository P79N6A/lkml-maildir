Nice problem statement.  Now we just need to see the proof that we satisfy 
this requirement for every cluster service, application, block device, etc 
for every possible cluster configuration and normal or failure state.
My assumption is that we will achieve this in a way that is efficient, easy to 
configure and not prone to deadlock, with emphasis on the "will".
