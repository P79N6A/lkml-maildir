This patch is for 2.4.10-ac8.
This changes the driver to use the new 2.4 kernel PCI APIs. This changes
how all our cards are detected. 
This adds some new IOCTLs for adding/deleting volumes while the driver
is online. 
It have added code to request/release the io-region used by our cards.
It has a small fix to the flush on unload.
