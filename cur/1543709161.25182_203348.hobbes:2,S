Thanks for the hint. Results:
 - Network interface works, no more lockups.
 - ifconfig still doesn't show the interupt being used.
 - /proc/interrupts DOES show the right interrupt.
experimenting with the driver source shows that the interrupt displayed by ifconfig seems to depend on netdev->irq being set; this was removed during the netdev->irq ==> adapter->pdev->irq change. adding the following line corrects ifconfig display:
