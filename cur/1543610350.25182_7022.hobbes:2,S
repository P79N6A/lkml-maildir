The bottom line here is:
There is no need for swap if you have enough ram.
Using swap with more than enough ram does absolutley nothing for the system,
except by degrading the performance of it.

There's more to it than "not run out". You have some fixed amount of RAM; if
the VM is working properly, adding swap will IMPROVE performance, because
that fixed amount of RAM is used more efficiently.
Obviously, there are cases where removing swap breaks the system entirely,
but even in other cases, adding swap should *never* degrade performance. (In
theory, anyway; in practice, it still needs tuning...)

In which case, the VM isn't working properly; it SHOULD page out infrequently
used data to make more room for caching frequently used files.
