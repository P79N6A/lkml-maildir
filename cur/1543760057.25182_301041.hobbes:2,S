Hello,
I am looking for Large Page Implmentation (similar to the hugetlb
effort) for ARM processors, specifically Xscale. Is there an ongoing
project any one can point me to?  I tried searching for before posting
this message but couldn't find anything relevant. If this questions
had already been asked, please bear with me and point me to the right
URL.
I am not subscribed to this list. So please include me in your replies.
Thanks,
Venkat
