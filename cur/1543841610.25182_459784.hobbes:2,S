Ok, here we go:
0) there is good data in a page
1) the host scans for pages to reclaim and selects a page of a
particular guest
2) the host checks the page state and decides to either swap the page or
discard it
3) nothing happens for a long time
4) the guest comes around and tries to access the long gone page
5) the host gets a fault because the page is gone from the hosts page
table for the guest system
6) the host delivers a discard fault to the guest
7) the architecture dependent fault handler gets a page reference for
the discarded page (tricky for s390)
8) page_discard is called which locks the page and does a
TestSetPageDiscarded. If the bit has not been set yet the page is
removed from the page cache. There can still be page references around.
Concurrent to 5-8 another cpu could be just be removing the page from
page cache as well. Without the check for the discarded bit the page
would get removed twice. This does nasty things to reference counting,

Ouch, I understand what you are trying to tell me. The struct page
entries that cover the mem_map array itself has free bits we could try
to cannibalize.
