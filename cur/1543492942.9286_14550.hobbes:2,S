I was seeing the correct filedates, so far as I can remember, but I'll
check at the weekend when I can set this combination up again (kernel
2.2.5, libc5, samba 2.0.3, winNT4sp3 [I've not dared install SP4 as it
is a Compaq Laptop, and I don't really fancy doing a complete re-install
with all the special Comcrap patches, if things were to go wrong]).
I do know however, that there is no problem with the setup here - kernel
2.0.33, libc5, samba 2.0.3, winNTSP[34].
Alan.
