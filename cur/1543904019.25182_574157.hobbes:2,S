However... What about that:
 - This "volatile" will allow to pass pointers to volatile data to the
bitops.
 - Most users of "volatile" in the kenrel (except maybe jiffies) are
bogus
 - Thus let's remove it -as a type safety thing- to catch more of those
stupid volatile that shouldn't be ? :-)
Besides, as Nick pointed out, it prevents some valid optimizations.
Cheers,
Ben.
