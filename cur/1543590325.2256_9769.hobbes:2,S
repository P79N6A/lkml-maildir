I can't test every platform when I have to make such changes.
But it always serves to show the port maintainer "what" the
change was.
Yes, I am slightly out of order if the intent is just "does
this idea look fine" (which it does btw, I can't  find any
problems with it).
I apologize to Maciej, but I do deplore him to actually do the
final bits for the other ports when he makes his final patch
submission.
