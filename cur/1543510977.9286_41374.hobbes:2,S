Well, it's more a question of who is grabbing minor numbers 64 and up
on the TTY_MAJOR/TTY_AUX_MAJOR major numbers, and the answer is that
is the driver for the Z8530-based serial ports, macserial.c.  It does
that because I based it on the zs.c serial driver for the Sparc, which
also does that.
One approach would be to have a range of minor numbers for Z8530-based
serial ports with names like /dev/ttyZn.  That would be the easiest
from a kernel developer's point of view, but I can foresee endless
confusion with new users who don't realize that just because a
powermac uses a different hardware chip for its serial ports from a
PC, you have to use different names for the serial ports.
The other thing that the serial driver does is go probing I/O ports
looking for serial devices.  Perfectly reasonable on PCs, causes a
machine check (and crash) on powermacs, unfortunately.
Maybe ultimately there could be a scheme for allocating serial minor
numbers to serial device drivers at runtime, as the devices are found.
Paul.
