Actually, yes.

That's under the assumption that the traces we get are always useful.

In this particular case, I'm not really interested in that.  What I'm
interested in is which driver's ->suspend_late() or ->resume_early() (or the
equivalents for sysdevs) has enabled interrupts, which is quite easy to
check directly.
