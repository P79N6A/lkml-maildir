I think it's just Daniel being unhappy because he didn't do the read-tree
+ checkout-cache + update-cache steps ;)
Btw, I'm going to stop cc'ing linux-kernel on git issues (after this
email, which also acts as an announcement for people who haven't noticed
already), since anybody who is interested in git can just use the
"git@vger.kernel.org" mailing list:
	echo 'subscribe git' | mail majordomo@vger.kernel.org
to get you subscribed (and you'll get a message back asking you to
authorize it to avoid spam - if you don't get anything back, it failed).

To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in
the body of a message to majordomo@vger.kernel.org
