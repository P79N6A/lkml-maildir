That just moves the supposed problem:  now the kernel is dictating "names"
passed to sysctl().  The argument doesn't seem to be over names so much as
it is over the *structure* imposed on the names.
The real question is whether there is any alternative to the kernel
dictating these so-called policies.  The kernel and userspace have to
agree on a minimum set of "names" or the kernel is not usable.  You can't
decide to use your own arrangement of syscall number bindings; you have to
use the same ones that the kernel recognizes.  For a given syscall, you
can't give the arguments in any order you like; you have to give what the
kernel expects to get if you want the results *you* expect.
In the case of sysctl() the user and the kernel must agree on which names
are passed because there is no mapping interposed.  But things are
different with /dev, because there is a mapping (major, minor) <-
/dev/{name} .  We can't take the sysctl() name policy away from the kernel
because there is no other way for the user and the kernel to understand
each other.  We *can* take away the /dev name policy if we agree on the
(major, minor) name policy, because of the mapping.  Therefor I conclude
that it is reasonable for the kernel to dictate sysctl() names but it is
reasonable to refuse to have it dictate /dev names.
