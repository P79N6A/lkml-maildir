This might be a bit more constant, I suppose. This serialises with cpuid. 
Don't see a difference locally, but perhaps you do.
On a Duron 1300 with an actual ISA bus, "out" is between 1300 and 1600 for 
me and "in" between 1200 and 1500 with a few flukes above that which will I 
suppose be caused by the bus (ISA _or_ PCI) being momentarily busy or some 
such...
