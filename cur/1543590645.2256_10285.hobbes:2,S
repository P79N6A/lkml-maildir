when it happens because of a double reserve that's fine I know, it _can_
be harmless, I'm not trying to hide those messages. What I'm saying is
that it can _also_ indicate somebody allocated the page before we reserved
it and currently x86 allocates from the bootmem allocator before
reserving all its pages, that's a bug and I provided the fix.
