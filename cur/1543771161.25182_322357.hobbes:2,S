You simply shoudn't care.  Just open the /dev/whatever device
node passed by the user and be happy ;)

I don't see what kind of special support you want implement in
cdrecord.  The user says "this device", cdrecord takes it and
opens it, tries a ioctl or two to figure what kind of device
handle that is (scsi generic or 2.6-style /dev/hdx), then uses
it to send scsi commands to the device.
You don't have to solve the problem of providing stable device
names within cdrecord.  That is the job of the operating system.
A udev-based linux distro can do that as you can see above.
cdrecord should just accept these device nodes, nothing more.
