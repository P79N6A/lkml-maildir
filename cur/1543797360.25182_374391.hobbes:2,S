It would be good if someone could submit a patch to fix
this up properly. It indeed sounds wrong.
The HPET patch seems to be generally unhappy. With it applied
I get lots of obviously wrong softlockup warnings from the
softlockup watchdog thread on a dual NForce4 system. So something
goes wrong with the timing there. The strange thing 
is that the system doesn't even have a HPET table so HPET code shouldn't
be executed - but it goes away when I revert the patch. Very
mysterious.
Also I think vgettimeofday doesn't handle 64bit HPET correctly
yet. Also why does it not use hpet_readq? 
I suspect the 64bit HPET patch needs some more cooking. I think
I will drop it for now.
I would suggest you submit the cleanups in there separately
(without changing semantics yet) 
then it will be easier to test in the future too.
