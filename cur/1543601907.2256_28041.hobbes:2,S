If you want to run artsd with RT prio, add suid root to artswrapper if it is
not already there - it should by default, but some distributors/packagers
don't get this right. If you start artsd via kcminit, check the realtime
checkbox, if you do manually, run artswrapper instead of artsd, i.e.
stefan@voyager:~/src/kdelibs/arts$ artswrapper -F10 -S4096
>> running as realtime process now (priority 50)
Artsd itself will not acquire RT prio, only artswrapper will. Noatun doesn't
contain time critical code, so there it doesn't matter.
