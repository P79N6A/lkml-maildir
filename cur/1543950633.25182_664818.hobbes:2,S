Subject: [BUG REPORT] smc911x: Auto negotiation NOT supported
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
I'm trying to port smc911x driver for a custom sh4 board,
and I have a problem with static IP adress allocation.
(It is OK for IP address allocation by DHCP.)
Here is brief information about the board.
CPU : SH7780 by Renesas
Ethernet : LAN9115 by SMSC
Kernel version : 2.6.24 from www.kernel.org
Distribution(Userland): BusyBox-1.2.0
The problem is that only the first ifup after cold boot succeed.
Here is the instruction how to reproduce the symptom.
(smc911x is recognized as eth0 on the board.)
1. boot up the board, and login.
2. ifup eth0  (after doing this, ping works)
3. ifdown eth0
4. ifup eth0 ("Auto negotiation NOT supported" printed, and ping doesn't works)
Please refer to the bottom of this mail.
FYI, in the smc911x.h, I modified some macros like the following.
   #define SMC_USE_SH_DMA    1
   #define SMC_USE_16BIT         0
   #define SMC_USE_32BIT         1
There's no change if I turn off SMC_USE_SH_DMA,
but if I turn on SMC_USE_16BIT instead of SMC_USE_32BIT,
the driver occurs OOPS.
I hope this is a known(fixed) issue.
Thanks in advance.
