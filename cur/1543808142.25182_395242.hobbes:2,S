Well at the moment it seems to be.  Basically a case of everything
seems to work but the semantics are weird and ugly, and not worth
doing if the legacy semantics are not maintained.

:)
Do you know if there is anything in what autofs does for mounts that
could be reused.
To a certain extent it would work find if I had a mount point and
all of the legacy directories were symlinks to it.
Anyway there are lots of possibilities and I will work something
out before it makes into the stable kernel.
I keep having the feeling that I might just wind up with everything
making sense under proc as I create more namespaces :)
