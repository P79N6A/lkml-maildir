This is maybe the most common case, but please understand that some
other case existe. 'routed' is a such case. It add a route to each
interface with no route and broadcast the information. With 2.2 and
later kernel we have to set up an interface, delete the route and
start routed. See this example :
ifconfig eth1 192.168.26.1 netmask 255.2552.255.0 \
    broadcast 192.168.26.255
route del -net 192.168.26.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
ifconfig eth2 192.168.27.1 netmask 255.2552.255.0 \
    broadcast 192.168.27.255
route del -net 192.168.27.0 netmask 255.255.255.0
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
echo -n "Starting network routing daemon: routed";
start-stop-daemon --start --quiet --exec /usr/sbin/routed;
echo "."
So after routed is started other machine can see networks
192.168.26.0 and 192.168.27.0. Ok, I can live with this hack. I just try
to show that set up an interface without a route can be useful.
