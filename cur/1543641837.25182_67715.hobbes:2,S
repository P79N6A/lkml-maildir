Agreed. Things like system responsiveness are fairly complex
though and in many cases the average numbers measured by
benchmarks don't mean anything to users.
I wish we had a way to measure this stuff, but I'll happily
philosophise with you guys until we come up with a useful
definition of something we could measure...

"low latency" != responsiveness
Any latency which is below the point the user can notice
is effectively zero, so whether the 10000 wakeups/minute
that the user doesn't notice are 2ms or 5ms don't really
matter.
What does matter are the wakeups that make the user's
mp3 skip, even if these don't influence the statistics
at all because there's only 1 every few minutes, or none,
if the VM is balanced right ;)
Another responsiveness thing is how fast you can swap in
Mozilla when the user comes in in the morning. More of a
throughput than a latency thing in this case ... but you
still have to make sure the mp3 doesn't skip while mozilla
is being loaded.

Rik
