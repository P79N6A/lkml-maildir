Hello.
I was compiling Ubuntu 7.10's kernel and I encountered OOM-killer.
I saw /proc/meminfo and it seems to me that slab is leaking memory.
But /usr/bin/slabtop claims /proc/slabinfo is missing.
I couldn't continue the compilation before reboot.
I could continue the compilation after reboot.
So, I think this is a memory leak.
How can I find slab that uses so much memory?
Regards.
