Sounds like it to me.  It certainly does not work on my i8000, but the 8100 
is possibly different.

Hmm.  Maybe the 8100 has working speedstep, then.  I'd suggest you see if 
disabling just the APM idle calls, but leaving speedstep and cpufreq on 
makes the noise.
I have had no success whatever with ACPI on an i8000, but again an 8100 may 
be different.

Same here, and I mostly agree.  Good price for such a nice screen, though 
(I have the 1600x1200 15" screen).
