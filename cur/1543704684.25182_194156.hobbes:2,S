Hi Pete,

We plan to do this for tape and other ccw devices as well (where applicable).

The reason for this change is the requirement to have persistent device
names. The /dev/dasdxyz naming schema heavily depends on the order in
which the device are added. Not good for persistent names. This change
affects four things: 1) the internal name, 2) the name of the sysfs
directory, 3) the root= parameter and 4) the hotplug events for dasd
devices.
