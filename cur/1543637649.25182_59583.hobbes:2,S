Subject: multicase version of the same filename possible

Hello,
I can create multiple files with the same long filename (variations in ca=
se
only) on a partition mounted as vfat. Most GUI Win apps can't really acce=
ss
the different files, the short names of course are different and the file=
s
can be read/written from windows only via their short names.
Here's my config
Slackware 8.1, gcc 2.95.3, kernel 2.4.18
/dev/hda1 on /dos type vfat (rw,noatime,uid=3D1000)
--=20
