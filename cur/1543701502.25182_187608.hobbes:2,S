Console code will need serious work anyway; note that current names
do _not_ refer to tty devices - there is some overlap, but right now
we have
	* console drivers
	* some of them being connected with tty drivers; those can tell
which tty driver corresponds to them
	* console ouput code maintaining chain of console drivers; output
is sent to them, attempt to open() /dev/console ends up picking the first
console driver that has corresponding tty one (== has console->device())
and opening the tty device in question
	* unholy mess with redirects.
There's no device nodes for console drivers.  So names in console=... are
something very odd, indeed.
