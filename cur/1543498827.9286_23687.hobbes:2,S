Mostly because it's such an ugly hack I never considered getting into
the standard kernel, and I think that when I posted it on linux-kernel
someone said there was a more generic memory detection scheme in the
linux-2.1 kernel already.
Another problem is that my code only handled autodetection of the
memory hole with a very specific Intel chipset (and a broken BIOS,
that's why I poked directly at the hardware).
It would probably be a better idea to backport the 2.2 memory
detection scheme to the 2.0 kernels, doing it right.  Any volunteers?
