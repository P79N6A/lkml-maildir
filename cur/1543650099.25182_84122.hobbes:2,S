That is not required.  The requirement is that, when the last step
happens (which can be any time in the future), (the inode of) foo.o
has been flushed, and foo.c hasn't.  Step 3 argues that this is
plausible.

foo.c and foo.o would both have timestamps of 0.  make considers
the target foo.o newer in this case, so will not rebuild it.
