You'd better be. As Alan Cox pointed out some time ago, this is the
compiler's duty, to be more precise, it's the peephole (local)
optimizer's task, if it's actually implemented in the core or the
backend, I cannot currently tell, and I don't care.
But see a minimal program 
main(int argc) {
        j(argc * 4);
}
run gcc -O2 -S thissource.c and then -O0 and compare. On an
amigaos-m68k configured gcc 2.7.2.3, this directly throws asll #2,d0
(arithmetic shift left by 2 positions, fill with trailing zeroes), -O2
saves some moving around. (I cannot read 386 assembly language, thus
m68k ;)
