What I have observed is that Linus tends to accept some major changes
that have achieved a certain consensus. ReiserFS is a good example. It
was in wide use and was being shipped by SUSE... not universal but
there was significant usage. Other good ideas with no significant
usage languish unless it is something interesting to Linus himself.
