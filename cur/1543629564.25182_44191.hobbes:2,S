Hi!
For swsusp, I need to write to the swap space.
I used technique similar to this:
static void mark_swapfiles(swp_entry_t prev, int mode)
{
        swp_entry_t entry;
        union diskpage *cur;
        cur = (union diskpage *)get_free_page(GFP_ATOMIC);
        if (!cur)
                panic("Out of memory in mark_swapfiles");
        /* XXX: this is dirty hack to get first page of swap file */
        entry = SWP_ENTRY(root_swap, 0);
        lock_page(virt_to_page((unsigned long)cur));
        rw_swap_page_nolock(READ, entry, (char *) cur);
... modify cur->fields...
        lock_page(virt_to_page((unsigned long)cur));
        rw_swap_page_nolock(WRITE, entry, (char *)cur);
        free_page((unsigned long)cur);
}
It seems not to work any more. Some io is done, but it is not
synchronous any more, and it does not seem to hit the disk.
What am I doing wrong, or is there something wrong in 2.5.12/2.5.13?
