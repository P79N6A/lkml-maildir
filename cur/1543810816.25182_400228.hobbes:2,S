I actually managed to successfully unmount the filesystem and deactivate
the LVM volume group for once, which allowed me to remove and reload
sata_via, libata, sd_mod and scsi_mod.
After the drivers were reloaded, IO to the disk worked fine, which leads
me to think that sata_via and/or libata needs the ability to reset the
hardware when errors occur.
