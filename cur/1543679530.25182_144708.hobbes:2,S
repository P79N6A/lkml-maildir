 Thank you very much Andrew! I was already thinking of contacting either
you or davem to pick that one up from me.
 By the way, what do you think about getting rid of the do_div() macro
altogether? I've noticed that gcc 3.3 is quite capable of guessing the
optimal instruction pattern to use even for the generic do_div()
written in C:
    rem = (unsigned long)div % (unsigned)base;
    div = (unsigned long)div / (unsigned)base;
This code makes gcc select the "udivmodsi4" pattern on the m68k
backend, which computes both the quotient and remainder with a
single instruction on some architectures. The compiler is even
smart enough to optimize the case where the remainder isn't used:
  if (find_reg_note (insn, REG_UNUSED, operands[3]))
    return \"divu%.l %2,%0\";
  else
    return \"divul%.l %2,%3:%0\";
So I don't see a performance issue here. There are even places
in the kernel where do_div() is used even when the remainder
isn't used, so it's a potential performance hit (but GCC is
again smart enough to detect that dead code and discards it ;-).
If there are architectures where gcc doesn't implement divisions
correctly, this issue should be solved in gcc, not by adding a
silly macro to the kernel.
