Dual-endianness is _evil_.
Admittedly host-endian is stupid too, but it's less stupid than being 
dual.
The only sane thing to do is fixed-endianness. I'm sure the m68k people 
remember being forced to fix their ext2 partitions back in the bad old 
days. It's painful once, but after that, fixed-endian is a lot more 
efficient and much simpler to handle.
