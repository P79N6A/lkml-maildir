Sorry for the late reply. As Johannes said, the other patches have nothing
to do with this anyway. I had to put this patch within my patchset because I
originally wanted to send a patch which would export signed values to
debugfs, but then I solved the issue in a different fashion, and I'm not
that interested in it at the moment.
BTW, the patch I sent was just meant to allow exporting signed values
through debugfs, but in order to do that I had to change some users as well.
And being spufs an user, I don't feel that much like sending a patch
without testing on ppc64 in advance.
