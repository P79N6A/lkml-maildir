Since there is no kgcc in RH71, will you be releasing an updated gcc
rpm, or is the best solution to download and compile egcs-1.1.2 from
source?
IMHO, it is best not to revert to an old egcs version, but instead
continue to find bugs in the upcoming 3.0 release.  I'm assuming that
your fixes for your gcc-2.96 are propagated to the pre-3.0 branch.
