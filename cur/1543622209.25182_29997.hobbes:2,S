So without preemption in the kernel
	maybe 4 instructions: calculate cpuid, inc; all local no cache ping
	code is easy to read and understand.
with preemption in the kernel
	a design problem. a slippery synchronization issue that 
	involves the characteristic preemption error - code that works
	most of the time.
