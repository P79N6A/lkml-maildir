Because people don't know where to look if it is out-of-the tree.
Seriously, if it can't be easily found, it's not fixed up.  Proof of
that is the hundreds of out-of-tree drivers that I have found over the
past months.

Woah, you are changing the conversation here totally.
This has nothing to do with "put pressure on a vendor to get their code
into upstream so that a distro will enable it."  We have vendors today
working with the staging tree to get their code cleaned up better to get
it into mergable shape to move over to the main portion of the kernel
tree.
Other vendors throw us code and run away.  We handle that as well, by
doing the work on our own, taking our time.  While that cleanup happens,
users can use their hardware with Linux without having to find the
latest version of a driver on a random google code site, and figure out
how to patch things to handle api changes that have happened since then
(true story for one of the drivers in staging right now.)

The staging tree has NOTHING to do with our coding and acceptance
standards.  And anyone that thinks otherwise is totally mistaken.

It was his choice to put the code into there, I'll let him handle the
mental issues of having that taint flag associated with it for a few
releases :)

I'll take responsibility if such a thing happens.  Fear of such a thing
is no reason to prevent users from having their hardware work properly
with Linux.
Again, I'll point to Linus's laptop that now works properly due to the
drivers/staging/ tree as a very visible example of this effort actually
working properly.
