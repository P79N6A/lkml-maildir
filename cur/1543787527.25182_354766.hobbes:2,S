Known story:
last stable kernel for this machine is/was 2.6.12-mm1
Every 2.6.1[34] kernel panics so far.
Sometimes after 40 minutes, sometimes after 4 days.
Config/more info at:
http://newsgate.newsserver.nl/kernel/2.6.14-rc2-git7/
This time it was scsi system again which "blew-up"
Obvious difference i see between 2.6.12 en 2.6.1[34] is that the 
scsi/ethernet cards have different IRQ's set. 
If i'm correct acpi code changed in 2.6.13, right ?
Since the 2.6.12-mm1 kernel survived 3 weeks+ and gave super performance
i'm convinced it's not a hardware issue.
Just giving feedback.
Will try git8 and mm2 and of course report here when they fail.
