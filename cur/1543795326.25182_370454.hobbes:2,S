Just a note to say glibc is getting better wrt to locking.
Compare the results and trival test program here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2001/12/7/75
That showed that for glibc 2.2.4, getc & putc
were 669% slower than the unlocked versions.
4 years later and with 2.3.5-1ubuntu1, getc & putc
are only 230% slower than the unlocked versions:
$ dd bs=1MB count=100 if=/dev/zero | ./locked >/dev/null
100000000 bytes transferred in 3.709362 seconds (26958813 bytes/sec)
$ dd bs=1MB count=100 if=/dev/zero | ./unlocked >/dev/null
100000000 bytes transferred in 1.602427 seconds (62405339 bytes/sec)
