It does have an AGP NVidia card in it. I'm using the standard XFree
drivers with it at the moment but I have played UT on it for hours
before (using NVidia drivers) without problems. It might be an AGP x2
card though. The computer is now mostly a back-end server and I haven't
really pushed it on the graphics side recently.
Could the problem be caused by some BIOS setting? I could spend some
time looking at them.

Yes, MP processors. This is not a new machine, It has been running quite
nicely for nearly two years. There have been some kernel releases in the
past that have shown some instability, but I can usually find a fairly
recent version and tweak the kernel-build settings so that it becomes
stable.
The version running prior to this one was 2.4.21-rc3. This version
allowed me to specify noapic.
