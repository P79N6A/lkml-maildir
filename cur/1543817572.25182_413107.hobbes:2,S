In fact, even worse, percpu_counter_read_positive() always return 1 if
the value is negative (>2**31). So this is not suitable for ext3's
2**32 block numbers. I think we should use percpu_counter_read() and
cast it to unsigned long for ext3's free blocks (and probably for free
inodes also).
Think over again, I think we could fix the possible overflow issue
(caused by approximate value) Andrew was concerned about: Before update
the global counter, check to see if we are trying to increase the global
counter but get a smaller value, or we are trying to decrease the global
counter but instead get a larger value. If any of them is true, we
should not update the global counter at that moment. This check only
happens when try to update the global counter from an local counter, and
probably not needed for those who don't care about unsigned long
counters. This way we shall not get ridiculous values from the counter.
