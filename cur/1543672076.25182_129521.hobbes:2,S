Subject: [PATCH 2.5] [TRIVIAL] Get rid of magic numbers in drivers/block/genhd.c

Hi Christoph,
a few days ago you cleaned up disk_name() in fs/partitions/check.c. It
is now guaranteed to write no more than BDEVNAME_SIZE into the provided
buffer.
There are two buffers in drivers/block/genhd.c, that are used solely for
calling disk_name(), and have a size of 64. The patch below replaces
these magic numbers with BDEVNAME_SIZE.
Additionally it corrects the comment at the top of disk_name(): The md
driver does not call that function, the genhd driver does.
René
