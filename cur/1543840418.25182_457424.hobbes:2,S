For the 2.6.9 kernel?  What about generating a patch for the latest
kernel version?
And you can do this a bit more simply, if you just want to disable all
devices from a specific manufacturer.  Look at the Watcom change that
does this in the current -mm tree.
Also, what driver will control these devices if the hid core does not?
Is it a userspace driver or a kernel one?
thanks,
