And there you document \* as well as \? as wildcards for "pathname 
patterns".
And \* is not a replacement for \?. It's quite common to have both ways 
to express "one character" and to express "at least one character", and 
both have their use cases and will get used if available.

That's unrelated to this problem.
You talk about your internal byte representation.
But the problem is that in your code you only match one byte for \?, 
and this might or might not be equal to one character.
