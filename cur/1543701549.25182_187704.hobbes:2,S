USB drive is a Pioneer DVR-SK11B-J. It's reported as ...
scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
  Vendor: PIONEER   Model: DVD-RW  DVR-K11   Rev: 1.00
  Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
I've tried at least 2 other USB drives (Plextor PX-208U, and Sony CRX85U),
and both of these drives also exhibit the same problem.
