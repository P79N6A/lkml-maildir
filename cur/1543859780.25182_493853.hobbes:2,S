Subject: [PATCH 1/1] usblp.c - add Kyocera Mita FS 820 to list of "quirky" printers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

this patch gets the Kyocera FS 820 working with cups 1.2 via usb again. It
adds the printer to the list of "quirky" printers. Patch is based on
linux-2.6.19.

Background:
I have little knowledge of usb, the following is based on my observations and
assumptions. With cups 1.2.6 going stable in gentoo, the usb backend does not
find the printer and thus users are not able to add the printer if it´s
connected via usb. In cups 1.1.x, the backend just reported a default bunch
of devices a printer might be connected to.
As far as I could see, cups detects the printer (/dev/usb/lp0) and sends an
ioctl which times out. I traced the timeout:
usblp.c calls usb_control_msg() (in message.c)
->usb_internal_control_msg()
->usb_start_wait_urb()
this function times out, the printer does not answer (0/1023 chars read).
Funny thing is, reading the identification works directly after plugging the
printer in, but not some seconds after. The patch lets the cups usb backend
find the printer again. So maybe the patch is a little crude. If someone has
a better idea, I may be able provide straces, syslog with DEBUG on,...
