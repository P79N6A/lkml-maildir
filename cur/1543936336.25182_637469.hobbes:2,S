Hi Linus,
before 2.6.24-final, please pull from: 
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/lenb/linux-acpi-2.6.git release
These are all regression fixes.
A couple will apply to 2.6.23.stable too.
thanks!
-Len

    PM: ACPI and APM must not be enabled at the same time
    
    ACPI and APM used "pm_active" to guarantee that
    they would not be simultaneously active.
    
    But pm_active was recently moved under CONFIG_PM_LEGACY,
    so that without CONFIG_PM_LEGACY, pm_active became a NOP --
    allowing ACPI and APM to both be simultaneously enabled.
    This caused unpredictable results, including boot hangs.
    
    Further, the code under CONFIG_PM_LEGACY is scheduled
    for removal.
    
    So replace pm_active with pm_flags.
    pm_flags depends only on CONFIG_PM,
    which is present for both CONFIG_APM and CONFIG_ACPI.

    ACPI: apply quirk_ich6_lpc_acpi to more ICH8 and ICH9
    
    It is important that these resources be reserved
    to avoid conflicts with well known ACPI registers.

    ACPI : Not register gsi for PCI IDE controller in legacy mode
    
    When PCI IDE controller works in legacy mode and no PRT entry is found
    in ACPI PRT table, OSPM will neither read the irq number from the IDE
    PCI configuration space nor call the function of acpi_register_gsi to
    register gsi.

    ACPI: Reintroduce run time configurable max_cstate for !CPU_IDLE case
    
    This was writeable in 2.6.23 but the cpuidle merge made it read-only.  But
    some people's scripts (ie: Mark's) were writing to it.
    
    As an unhappy compromise, make max_cstate writeable again if the kernel was
    configured without CONFIG_CPU_IDLE.

    ACPI: EC: Enable boot EC before bus_scan
    
    Some _STA methods called during bus_scan() might require EC region handler,
    which might be enabled later in the scan.
    Enable it explicitly before scan to avoid errors.

    increase PNP_MAX_PORT to 40 from 24
    
    a7839e960675b549f06209d18283d5cee2ce9261
    (PNP: increase the maximum number of resources)
    increased PNP_MAX_PORT to 24 from 8.
    It also added a test and a complaint when a
    machine exceeded the limit, causing:
    
    pnpacpi: exceeded the max number of IO resources: 24
    
    
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9535
    
    We should have been squawking about this all along,
    as this is a potentially serious issue.
    
    For now, simply burn some dynamic bytes and
    increase the limit by another 16 to 40.
    There is no guarantee that this will satisfy
    every system on Earth.  It probably will not,
    but it should be an improvement.
    
    In the future, PNPACPI should allocate resource
    structures as needed, rather than max-sized arrays.
