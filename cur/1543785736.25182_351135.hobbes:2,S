AFAIR the article on the lwn.net in the driver porting porting to 2.6
kernel mentioned that big kernel locks lock_kernel and unlock_kernel
gone, but as I searched into the kernel's drivers directory for the
kernel_thread functions (drivers creating threads), I found some of
them using lock_kernel and some not .... So I also wants to know are
they really needed ??
By the way I havn't saw/felt any long delay when starting thread in
this way using lock_kernel !!!!
