Quick update on this.
I've also ran
	while true; do
	        sudo mount -o loop loopfs loopmnt && dd if=/dev/zero of=loopmnt/dummy bs=1M
	        sudo umount loopmnt
	        sleep 2
	done
and
	while true; do
	        /sbin/modprobe -r loop
	        /sbin/modprobe loop
	        sleep 1
	done
in parallel on the Core2 Quad box for about 6 hours now. Same thing. No signs of problems 
whatsoever, with the "stop machine" completely disabled. Everything is working as expected.
Here we're exercising sysfs, block and fs layers.
So I'm now even more eager to see your response :).
btw Does anyone else have a module load/unload scenario that definitely requires stop machine ?
