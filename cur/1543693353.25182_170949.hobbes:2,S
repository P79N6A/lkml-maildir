Ok.. attributes do consume maximum in sysfs. In the system I mentioned
leaf dentries are about 65% of the total.

That's not correct... kobject corresponding to /sys/block/hda/queue 
doesnot know which kset it belongs to and what are its attributes. Same
for /sys/block/hda/queue/iosched.

Having backing store just for leaf dentries should be fine. But there is 
_no_ easy access for attributes. For this also I see some data change required 
as of now. The reasons are 
 - not all kobjects belong to a kset. For example, /sys/block/hda/queue
 - not all ksets have attribute groups
I don't see any generic rule for finding attributes or attribute group
of a kobject. Such random-ness forced me to add new fields to kobject. The
sysfs picture doesnot show the kset-kobject relationship. For example
kobject corresponding /sys/devices/system does not belong to devices_subsystem.
and it is not in the devices_subsys->list. There was no other way except to
build new hierarchy info in the kobject. 
What are people's opinion about the way I have linked attributes and
attributes_group to the kobject. I could not link "struct attribute" and
"struct attriubte_group" directly to kobject because these are generally 
statically alocated and many kobjects will have the same attribute structure.
and are asigned to multiple kobjects 
Thanks
