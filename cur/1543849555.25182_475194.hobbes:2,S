There are definitely warts related to the new EH stuff, but specifically 
for SATA + ata_piix, it has been a long hard road of trying various 
probing mechanisms.  Tejun has some patches that revert all the PCS work 
and rewinds back to original SATA ata_piix probing, in -mm for testing.
If testing feedback proves positive, let's go ahead and fast-track that 
up the line.
With ata_piix, I would worry more about PCS register follies than core 
libata.  Users can try the module option force_pcs=[0|1|2] to experiment 
and see if any of the three possibilities improves their boot.
