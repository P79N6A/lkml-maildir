IMHO they want it for testing logical removal, hot removal without hardware 
support is just too dangerous to test with dummyphp. Or what am I missing?

Ehm? Did you read the code? I use the PCI domains of the slots and buses. And 
by default there are only slots with devices in it shown now.

That can't be. I hate fakephp ;)
