I did some checkpoint/restart work on Linux about 5 years ago (you may
still be able to google "CRAK"), so I'm jumping in with my 2 cents.

It's hard, but not impossible, at least theoretically.

This is actually one of the simplest problems in checkpoint/restart.
You'd need kernel support to save the state, and restart could be done
entirely in user space to restore the file descriptors.

Right, this is really hard. I played with it 5 years ago and I had semi
success on restoring network connections (with my limited understanding
on Linux networking and some really ugly hacks). I could restart a
killed remote Emacs X session with about 50% success rate.

Again, it IS very hard, but I don't think it's impossible to have
transparent checkpoint/restart. I mean, it cant be more difficult than
writing Linux from scratch, can it? :-)

I agree with this. Before we see a mature checkpoint/restart solution
already implemented, there is no point in doing the vpid thing.
