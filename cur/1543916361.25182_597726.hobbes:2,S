with acpi=off, that we do lose some features including acpi hotplug
and power management feature...
but we don't lose anything about numa ( multi-cores...) and
bus-numa... (we get these info from NB pci conf for AMD rev C, rev E,
rev F, and Fam 10 opteron)...
Finally we lose bugs introduced by ACPI code ...
