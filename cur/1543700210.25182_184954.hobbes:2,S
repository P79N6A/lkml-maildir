I agree, and so do any other kernel developers who have tried to handle
module cleanup properly :)
Some modules can't mark themselves as "busy" as there really isn't such
a operation for them (like the keyboard driver, when is it busy?  When
you are typing?)  So they allow themselves to be unloaded at any time if
you want to.
I don't think any distros have the 'rmmod cleanup' cron entry in them
anymore for this very reason.  I think that happened around the time 2.2
came out, but it might have been later...

module unload is there to help kernel developers.  Yes it does seem to
work for 99% of the time for everyone, but there's some fun races in
places that are almost impossible to fix properly.  See the various
threads in the lkml archives for more details on this (including Rusty's
proposed fix that we just never unload modules at all, but just mark the
memory as "used" and then load the next version in a different place.)

module unloading is tricky.  In short, if you can ever help it, don't.
It's there as a convience, and that's about it.  There's now a config
option that you have to explictly enable in order to get that "feature",
CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD.
Hope this helps clear things up.
