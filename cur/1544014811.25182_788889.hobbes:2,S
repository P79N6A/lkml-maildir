Yes.  This is a platform problem, no doubt, but this patch makes it painfully

Well, _I_ can live with a few 'echo disabled > /sys/devices/.../power/wakeup'
lines in my init scripts, but I'm afraid we're going to get many problem
reports related to this.  This means people will likely lose time on trying to
debug this problem and someone will have to handle the reports.  Are you
volunteering to do that?
Also, it would have been nice to notify people of such a change of behavior in
advance.
Thanks,
