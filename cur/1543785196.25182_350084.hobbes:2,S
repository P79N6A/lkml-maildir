That means Linux is not a suitable operating system for multimedia 
applications.
MIDI needs to schedule in 1 ms or smaller increments. The userland 
application
should be able to set this. It should be able to determine this. If it 
cannot
then it is useless. (It also explains why MIDI based applications are so
absolutely dreadful on Linux.)
