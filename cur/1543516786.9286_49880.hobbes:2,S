You probably don't have any global symbols that ksymoops can use in your
driver. You can always load your driver with debugging info, i.e.,
#ifdef DEBUG
#define DEB(f) f
#else
#define DEB(f)
#endif
	DEB(printk("address was %p\n", foo));
In this case, if DEBUG is not defined, DEB(x) goes away entirely.
Since the paging address looks reasonable, it looks as though there
is some reason why a page-fault could not be done. This is usually
caused by somebody trying to write to user-space while holding a lock.
This cannot be done. Also space dynamically allocated in an interrupt
has to be GFP_ATOMIC. If you need to copy this data to user-space
under a lock, it has to be done in two steps:
    spinlock_t device_lock;
    long flags;
    spin_lock_irqsave(&device_lock, flags);       /* No interrupts */
    memcpy(tmp_buffer, interrupt_buffer, length); /* Get interrupt data */
    spin_unlock_irqrestore(&device_lock, flags);  /* Allow interrupts */
    copy_to_user(user_buf, tmp_buffer, length);   /* Copy to user */
