the soundcard IRQ trace you got is interesting:

do you have PREEMPT_REALTIME enabled? The above trace is a direct
interrupt - only the timer interrupt is allowed to execute directly in
the PREEMPT_REALTIME model - things break badly if it happens for any
other interrupt (such as the soundcard IRQ).
