Hmmm... I'm still having trouble making sense of this.
So, it seems that you're saying that all tasks, regardless of timeslice 
length, are interrupted every 10ms (at 100hz).  If another task exists 
at a higher priority, then it gets run at that point. However, if there 
is more than one task at a given priority level, then they will not 
round-robin until the current task has used up all of its timeslice 
(some integer multiple of 10ms).
Am I finally correct, or do I still have it wrong?  :)
