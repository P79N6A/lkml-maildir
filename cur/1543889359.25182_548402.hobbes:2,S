Ah, yeah, that's platform specific, I thought you were confused about 
how the sizing worked.  On x86, we either have to look at ACPI tables 
(yay) or use type 1 config accesses to get at the mmconfig base 
register (which is what the patches Olivier and I posted do).  On ia64 
there are firmware calls to do config space accesses.  Not sure about 
other platforms.
I'm not claiming mmconfig is great and we should make everything use it, 
but we do need it these days, so we should figure out a good way of 
getting at it.
