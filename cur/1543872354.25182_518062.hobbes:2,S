[sorry for the dup: this time to the right recipient]
So far I've tried the simple "survive having no handler
for a vector" patch and the preliminary 3-patch series
that was in -mm for a while, and neither work on the
Dell PowerEdge 29xx and 19xx systems. These servers
have the Intel 5000X chipset with the 6700PXH PCI Hub
with dual independent PCI-X busses, each with its own
I/OxAPIC with 24 interrupts. The fixes do work on
"simple" systems but not on these high-end ones.
