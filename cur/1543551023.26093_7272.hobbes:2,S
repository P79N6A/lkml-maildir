'importance' is not something we can measure reliably within the kernel.
And assuming that a niced, not long-running process is unimportant misses
the bus as well. What if i just started an important simulation before
going to vacation for two weeks?

yes, i would. I would probably end up not using nice values. Please, Rik,
dont penalize an unrelated kernel feature!

your OOM code does not follow this objective:
+       /*
+        * Niced processes are most likely less important, so double
+        * their badness points.
+        */
+       if (p->nice > 0)
+               points *= 2;
Niced processes *can be just as important*.

yes. Please remove the above part.
