gentoo doesn't have docbook-utils. How do I compile linux kernel
documentations on gentoo?
And btw why doesn't README or the error message that docbook-utils
package is required? I suggest that this be added into README together
with the docbook stylesheets (and the information which one of the 2
stylesheets are meant).
