It seems to crash when it tries to expand the stack and there is no available
mem. If you try:
  while(1){
    malloc(256K);
    fill;
  }
the program will be killed. But an infinite recurse will crash even if you
don't malloc anything.

No :-(  Someone should have a look into the code which expands the stack...
