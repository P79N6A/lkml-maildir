These are the strings used to identify the required line discipline
module to kmod, aren't they?
Since modprobe.conf seems to be generated without much regard for
architectures, is there any reason why this definition should differ
amongst architectures?  I think the answer's "no", so I think this fix
should be in linux/termios.h (or somewhere architecture independent).
