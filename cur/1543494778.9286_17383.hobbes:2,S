I was doing some tar operations on a failing scsi device (lots of errors)
using 2.2.6 and managed to get the following kernel oops. Missing code to
check error conditions?
scsi0: MEDIUM ERROR on channel 0, id 4, lun 0, CDB: Read (6) 1b 00 53 02 00
Current error sd08:01: sense key Medium Error
Additional sense indicates Unrecovered read error

EXT2-fs error (device sd(8,1)): read_block_bitmap: Cannot read block bitmap - block_group = 108, block_bitmap = 884746

While I've got the attention of anyone that might be into ext2 filesystem,
let me take this chance to say that there are several alternatives to the
"capability" system that's gotten some attention lately. So those of you
who are writing a new filesystem, please don't neglect the opportunity to
make accomodations for security improvements other than capabilities. (which
personally I think are misguided because of their inadequacy, but to each
their own)
