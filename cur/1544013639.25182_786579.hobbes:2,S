Yes. That's entirely possible. However, have you verified that if an async

Yeah. The problem is that that driver is used on such varied hardware. But 
we can probably pick it up from PnP/ACPI, and autoprobe only for things 
that don't get the info from there (either because they are not PC's, or 
becuase PnP/ACPI isn't configured in). 
This is one case where I wouldn't be afraid of PnP information, because we 
could easily choose to only trust it if it makes sense (ie "if it's the 
standard 2f8/irq3 thing, then you might as well trust PnP").
