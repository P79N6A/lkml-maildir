Why is it incoherent? If the user did not choose some feature, but it is turned
on anyways because of some dependency noone is hurt. I can see no negative 
effects.

That sounds error prone. Real users don't real manuals. They want some feature
(e.g. policy routing) and for them that rtnetlink is needed to configure it is 
just some implemention detail that they shouldn't have to (and needn't) care 
about.     
Will you answer all the questions about it on l-k and the newsgroups?
