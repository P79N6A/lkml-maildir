	No, it should not.  And devfs, for once, has nothing to do with it.
RAID devices (md*) have _one_ (1) minor allocated to each.  Consequently,
they could not be partitioned by any kernel - there is no device numbers
to be assigned to their partitions.

	What would be much more interesting, which kernel are _you_ using
and what device numbers, in your experience, do these partitions get?
