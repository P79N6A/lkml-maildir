Ok.  This looks like the best version so far.
I like the utsname() function thing to shorten the 
idiom of  current->uts_ns->name.
We probably want to introduce utsname() and an init_utsname()
before any of the other changes, and then perform the substitutions,
before we actually change the code so the patchset can make it
through a git-bisect.  This will also allows for something
that can be put in compat-mac.h for backports of anything that
cares.
