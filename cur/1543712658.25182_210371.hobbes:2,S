I don't know if loading modules can be done without, but the usual way
is to mount /sys and /proc so you can see what hardware is available.
I do that too for my dm-crypt setup, even mount a tmpfs at /dev,
create devices, start usb hotplugging, etc. but after getting the
decryption key, all filesystems are unmounted again, all processes
killed, there is nothing visible to me left. would that still create
some problems in the kernel internals preventing resume (or making it
too hard to do)?
