Not true, VIPT caches participate in cache coherency transactions
with the PCI host controller (and thus the PCI device), whereas
VIVT caches do not.
It does make a big difference, it's very hard to share datastructures
with a device concurrently accessing them (what we call PCI consistent
DMA mappings) on a VIVT cache.
