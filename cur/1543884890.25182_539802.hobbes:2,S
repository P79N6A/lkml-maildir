There aren't many effective sideband methods to document things. If I
knew of an "expanded help" thing people could look at in Kconfig, I'd
write storybook documentation and put it there as I'm wont to do.

It's short for "whoever doesn't understand the terse jargon" as I'm
using it. The assumption here is that it's essentially for kernel
hackers who know all about kernel internals up-front anyway.
The option really is not to be trifled with. Maybe I could work with the
kerneldoc developers to arrange for outlets for more verbose
documentation for options (actually I'd like similar for API functions
as well; I'd like to write IRIX-style roman fleuve manpages for things).
There is a slight danger, though, that the documentation may get out of
synch. For now, I just have nowhere appropriate to put it.
