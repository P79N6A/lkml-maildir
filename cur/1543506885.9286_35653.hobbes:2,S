I will admit right off, I have been away for 2 weeks and I did try to
read it all, and maybe I missed this before, but... here is the
question:
             total       used       free     shared    buffers    
cached
Mem:        127504      78172      49332          0        384     
39772
-/+ buffers/cache:      38016      89488
Swap:       130044          0     130044
Is that normal now?  Shared used to be like 20 meg and buffers the same
and cached about 40 meg.  Buffers is pending writes I thought.  I don't
know what the rest is.
