While we're at it, here's a tiny cleanup for a compile warning from John
Cherry's build stats[1].  You may have a cleaner way you'd rather handle
this.
  CC [M]  security/root_plug.o
security/root_plug.c:57:1: warning: "dbg" redefined
In file included from security/root_plug.c:30:
include/linux/usb.h:979:1: warning: this is the location of the previous definition
