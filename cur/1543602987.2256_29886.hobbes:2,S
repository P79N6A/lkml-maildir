Hi Rik.

There's actually one example in the email you were replying to where the
server is the local machine and the client is the remote one, which you
must have overlooked: X-Windows defines the server as being the machine
with the display that it is to draw its picture on.
Perhaps I can offer a more reasonable definition than yours, and one
that is offered by most UK universities:
    SERVER	The system with some facility which other systems
		wish to make use of.
    CLIENT	The system wishing to make use of some facility on
		the server.
Apply that to the relevant protocols and you get the following table:
	PROTOCOL	SERVER		CLIENT
	Login - CHAP	Local		Remote
	Login - PAP	Local		Remote
	Login - SSH	Local		Remote
	Login - Text	Remote		Local
	FTP		Remote		Local
	LogServer	Remote		Local
	PrintServer	Remote		Local
	RealAudio	Remote		Local
	Web		Remote		Local
	X-Windows	Local		Remote
	NetConsole	???		???
Note that under that definition, the server can be either the local or
the remote system, with a 3:2 bias towards it being the remote system. I
don't know NetConsole, so can't comment on how it uses them.
Also note that for one task (logging in) that can be done by four
different methods (that I am aware of), only one of those methods has
the server as the remote system. The CHAP, PAP and SSH login systems all
define the local machine (the one trying to log in) as being the one
having the private part of a public/private keypair, with both systems
having the public part, and therefore assume that the local system is
the server that will authenticate a message sent by the remote client to
verify that the server is the correct system and user. Only the text
login assumes the opposite.

>From their point of view, they already are where the server is, so no
shipping is necessary.
