No, they can't.  Even if in your case the underlying address spaces
happen to be the same anything returned by ioremap must use the proper
accessors.  That's the whole point of having this separation, otherwise
you wouldn't need to use ioremap at all.  So instead of sprinkling cast
around add lguest_read*/lguest_write* accessors that do the __force cast
once and make sure the ioremap return value is always accessed using those.
