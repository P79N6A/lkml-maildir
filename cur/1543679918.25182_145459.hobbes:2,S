Subject: [ANN] 2.4.x snapshots started
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Just like 2.5.x, nightly snapshots of Marcelo's latest 2.4.x BK 
repository are being posted on kernel.org:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/snapshots/
I created the first snapshot midday as a test, and the standard cron job 
created a second one, so the current release is 2.4.21-bk2.
Note that snapshots are NOT based off -pre and -rc releases.  2.4.21-bkN 
will continue, for ascending values of N, until 2.4.22 is released.
Just like 2.5.x, when a new version is released, the old snapshots are 
moved into
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/snapshots/old/
Just like 2.5.x, when a new snapshot appears, another automated job 
generates the incremental diff between this and the last snapshot:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/snapshots/incr/
