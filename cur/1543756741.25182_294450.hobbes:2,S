Does this happen on exit or on startup?  Looks like allocation problems,
which will be harder to fix, since you can't return to userland until
the allocation is complete.  AFAICT the correct fix is to use
finer-grained locks, hold them for less time, and not use _irq or
_irqsave unless necessary.  host_info_lock, in particular, is held for
far too long.
