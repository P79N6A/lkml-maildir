These should be OK either way.  pv_irq_ops is not _GPL.

These could reasonably use the the native_* versions anyway, since the
driver won't be being used in an environment where these won't work. 
Perhaps they should be split out separate from the gdt/ldt operations,
which they should have no business touching.

Yeah, I guess they can be expected to play with pagetables.

Yeah.  It will explode if you are running in a virtual environment which
still gives the virtual machine graphics hardware access.

Yeah.  I think removing the difference between PARAVIRT and non-PARAVIRT
is enough to justify the exports.  If we want to make the policy
decision that modules can't use pagetable or msr operations at all, then
that's a separate decision which can be applied uniformly to PARAVIRT
and non-PARAVIRT.
