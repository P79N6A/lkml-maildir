You have it backwards.  It is not about reserving a block of memory
for DMA.  It is about reserving a block of memory to not do DMA in.
Something like 4MB or so.  
The idea is not to let the original kernel touch the reserved block at all.
We just put the kernel that kexec will start in that block of memory.
