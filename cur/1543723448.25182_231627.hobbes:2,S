No worries. I have to remind myself over and over again to put the
"please cc me" header on every msg =)

Thks, this is definitely valuable info. I will surely go after some new
cables to see if it improves my situation (I hope it does, otherwise I
will have to move services away from this box and relocate them to other
servers, which will be a PITA...)
On a side note, I browsed 2.4.27rc2 changelogs today, and there is some
interesting stuff there about interruptions, ACPI etc. Looking forward
to trying it out.
Thks again,
Andre
