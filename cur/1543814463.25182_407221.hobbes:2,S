If neither mmap nor nopage allocated something, then vmops->close
would be the wrong point at which to free it, I think.
If dev->probe allocated something, module unload would be the right
point to free it.  If fops->open allocated something, fops->release
would be the right point to free it.
I think.  Beware, I've never written a Linux driver, and may well
have this wrong or oversimplified: in which case, I'll have annoyed
someone enough for them to correct me very soon.
