Actually, does init close all its file descriptors?  Otherwise you
could simply pass a file descriptor to init when init is executed.
If init explicitly closes file descriptors then that's not possible,
but perhaps that could be fixed in init.
On the other hand, if you killall -9 arbitrary processes as root, then
perhaps getting a dirty filesystem on reboot is ugly but not
catastrophic.
