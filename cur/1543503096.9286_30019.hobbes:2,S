  Start a large find and then reboot the server. The dcache stuff has to be
  fixed yet. Thats the messy one.
  
That one hasn't hit me (yet.. grabs for rabbit's foot and 4 leaf
clover). Anyway server reboots should hopefully be rare.
Can the patches from knfsd 1.4.6 *please please please* go into
2.2.11? I spent a long time cursing linux for it's broken NFS because
I didn't know about these patches. I'm sure there are a lot of other
people out there in the same position. It really should be in the
main tree.
