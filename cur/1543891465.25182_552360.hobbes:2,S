splice() WILL return EAGAIN, but in that case it should have triggered
the read-ahead and thus started some IO. At least that was/is the
intention, and it worked like that originally. Since I'm deep on the
splice updating for sendfile etc right now anyway, I'll doubly verify
that it still works that way as expected!
For the from-file case, see __generic_file_splice_read(). splice does:
       if (!PageUptodate(page)) {
               /*
                * If in nonblock mode then dont block on
                * waiting
                * for an in-flight io page
                */
               if (flags & SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK) {
                       if (TestSetPageLocked(page))
                               break;
               } else
                       lock_page(page);
but it doesn't know whether this call into __generic_file_splice_read()
initiated IO to that page or if someone else did. Naturally this will
most often be the case that __generic_file_splice_read() was the one
that initiated IO to that page, but it could be someone else of course.
The code above doesn't actually return EAGAIN, but
generic_file_splice_read() turns a 0 return for SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK into
EAGAIN.
So we need a bit of tweaking. I don't see how we can make b) work well
enough without getting hackish and breaking into the page cache and
read-ahead code, so I'd be inclined to suggest we make it conform to
your a) case. Now I didn't test yet, but it seems that just doing:
      if ((flags & SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK) && spd.nr_pages) {
              if (TestSetPageLocked(page))
                      break;
      } else
              lock_page(page);
should do that - always block for the first page and potentially return
a partial results for the remaining pages that read-ahead kicked into
gear.
