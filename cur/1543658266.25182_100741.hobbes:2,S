Cool.  Now if only atyfb didn't completely mess up my console in 2.4 and
2.5, on my Dell Inspiron 3800 (Rage Mobility P/M, AGP 2x)..
I have too many other projects I'm working on right now to dedicate a
lot of time trying to fix it, but if you had suggestions for what to
try, I'd appreciate it.
Simply loading the atyfb module, without any args, causes the screen to
go blank.  I can see the cursor blinking, but I can't see any text
output.

It's not denial.  I'm just selective about the reality I accept.
