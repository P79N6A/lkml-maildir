Finally managed to make 2.3.99-pre3 recognise my Xircom Cardbus
RBEM56G.  Turned out the expansion ROM was not being correctly
activated in the PCI code, patch below.
While diagnosing this problem, I spotted a couple of bits of code that
worry me in arch/i386/kernel/pci-i386.c.  In pcibios_update_resource,
line 104 we have
        new = res->start | (res->flags & PCI_REGION_FLAG_MASK);
When the region type is I/O, that sets the LSB on the new register
value, e.g.  an I/O address of 0x1400 is written to register 0x10 as
0x1401.  Is that correct?
pcibios_enable_resources loops from idx = 0 to idx < 6 to work out
which flags to set for PCI_COMMAND.  In the unlikely event of a card
which has I/O, no memory but has expansion ROM then PCI_COMMAND will
only be set to PCI_COMMAND_IO, PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY will not be set.
Should enable resources check idx <= 6 instead of id < 6, just in case?
