I don't think this bug has anything to do with anything else.
This program seems to show that PTRACE_KILL simply doesn't work.
What ptrace_kill() does is effectively:
 - stage 1: ptrace_check_attach(): wait for child stopped
 - stage 2: PTRACE_KILL does:
	child->exit_code = SIGKILL;
	wake_up_process(child);
and the thing is, it looks like the signal handling changes have totally
made the child ignore the "exit_code" thing, unless I'm seriously
misreading something.
Roland, you know this code better than I do. Any comments?
I suspect the PTRACE_KILL logic should also do a
	spin_lock_irqsave(child->sighand->siglock, flags);
	sigaddset(&child->pending->signal, SIGKILL);
	set_tsk_thread_flag(child, TIF_SIGPENDING);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(child->sighand->siglock, flags);
	ptrace_detach(child);
which would set the SIGKILL thing properly, but I suspect we had a good
reason not to do it that way originally. 
Daniel?
