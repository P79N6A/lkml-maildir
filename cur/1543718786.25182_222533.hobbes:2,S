To be fair: At the time, Peter and I did indeed discuss the changes that
were needed in order to support both Lustre and NFS. The main reason why
I ended up sending in the "NFS minimal" patch was IIRC that Peter was
not ready at the time to send in a full Lustre client that could make
use of this interface.
Peter, I have a couple of objections here
        vfs_intent-flags_rename-vanilla-2.6.patch and
        vfs-intent_exec-vanilla-2.6.patch breaks NFS (though ironically
        it fixes CIFS) due to that gratuitous change of semantics from
        FMODE_READ/FMODE_WRITE to O_RDONLY/O_WRONLY/O_RDWR. Exactly why
        couldn't Lustre work with the native VFS semantics?
        vfs_intent-flags_rename-vanilla-2.6.patch also reverts the
        format from being a union of intents for various operations to
        being a single structure. This goes against what was agreed upon
        on linux-fsdevel when this issue was discussed last summer (in
        fact Linus was the one who requested the union approach). What
        justification exists now for a change?
        The vfs-intent_lustre-vanilla-2.6.patch + the "intent_release()"
        code. What if you end up crossing a mountpoint? How do you then
        know to which superblock/filesystem the private field belongs if
        there are more than one user of this mechanism?
        vfs-revalidate_counter-vanilla-2.6.patch: can't "counter" be put
        into the private part of your intent structure so that the whole
        test may be done within Lustre?
        vfs-revalidate_special-vanilla-2.6.patch: see the use of the
        flag FS_REVAL_DOT in order to enable the revalidation of the
        current directory for those filesystems that need to do so.
Cheers,
  Trond
