Mark,
msi_target_apic() initializes address_lo parameter.
Even on a UP machine, we need inialize this value.
If target is called unconditionally, wouldn't it be better
for msi_target_apic() always be called?
It would also be good for msi_target_apic to validate the 'dest_cpu' is online.
Maybe a BUG_ON or something like that.

ps. not done looking through this...and still curious to see where
    other discussion about generic vector assignment leads.
