My thinking is that a timer implementation that forced (f) would have
problems gaining acceptance (even with me :).  I think a tick less
system does force this and this is why we have, at least for the moment,
abandoned it.  In no way does this preclude (f) as it is compatible with
either ticks or tick less time keeping.  On the other hand, the stated
project objectives do not include (f) unless, of course we do a tick
less time system.

The complexity comes in when you want to maintain indexes into the list
for quick insertion of new timers.  To get the current insert
performance, for example, you would need pointers to (at least) each of
the next 256 centasecond boundaries in the list.  But the list ages, so
these pointers need to be continually updated.  The thought I had was to
update needed pointers (and only those needed) each time an insert was
done and a needed pointer was found to be missing or stale.  Still it
adds complexity that the static structure used now doesn't have.

As I said above, we are not ruling it out, but rather, we are not
requiring it by going tick less.

As I said, it is not clear how you could get
CONFIG_USELESS_PROCESS_TIME_ACCOUNTING unless you did a tick every
jiffie.  What did you have in mind?

For the most part, I agree.  I am not sure that it makes a lot of sense
to mix some of these options, however.  I think it comes down to the
question of benefit vs cost.  If keeping an old version around that is
not any faster or more efficient in any way would seem too costly to
me.  We would like to provide a system that is better in every way and
thus eliminate the need to keep the old one around.  We could leave it
in as a compile option so folks would have a fall back, I suppose.
An Issue no one has raised is that the tick less system would need to
start a timer each time it scheduled a task.  This would lead to either
slow but very precise time slicing or about what we have today with more
schedule overhead.
