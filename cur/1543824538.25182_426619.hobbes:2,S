It's certainly less than and ideal situation .. If set an interrupt as
SA_NODELAY you'd think that it's suppose to be high priority , but then
you share it with something that's not high high priority which doesn't
make a lot of sense ..
However, the PCI bus doesn't (as far as I know) allow for interrupts to
easily be isolated .. So, with PCI, you may end up with potentially high
priority interrupts shared with some other interrupt .. So it is a
situation that could happen, maybe even often .
