Shoot, you don't even need it in the kernel. That will make a bunch
of folks even happier. 
Here's a warning. 
"WARNING. This is DSM support code. 
1) If you don't like it, for religious or other reasons, don't use it. 
2) If you like it, but it doesn't work well for your particular
   application, don't use it.
3) If you like it, and it works well for your application, use it but 
   don't tell anyone on linux-kernel because a bunch of them will 
   yell at you and tell you it doesn't work."

We need a new bumper sticker:
"I'm sorry, my dogma ran over your karma"
