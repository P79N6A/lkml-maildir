You'd need to pass on some opaque buffer from the issuer to the flush
cache function for that to work, which would be ugly.

Right, and during that transform, REQ_BLOCK_PC is cleared:
+       rq->flags &= ~REQ_BLOCK_PC;
+       rq->flags |= REQ_DRIVE_TASK | REQ_STARTED;
(REQ_STARTED should be removed, btw).

This depends entirely on what you assume with a barrier and what the
upper layers want. My implementation guarentees that existing data sent
to drive is on platter before you issue the barrier. What is confusing
is that you cannot pass back where the error occured, that probably
needs some work.
