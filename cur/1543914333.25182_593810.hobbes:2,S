I found the problem for EFI runtime service supporting. Where the EFI
runtime code (from firmware) need to be mapped without NX bit set.

This change is sufficient for Intel CPU. Because the NX bit of PTE is
still there, no page will be made executable if not been set explicitly
through PTE. For AMD CPU, will the page be made executable if the NX bit
of PMD is cleared and the NX bit of PTE is set? If so, I will do the
change as you said.

It is needed by EFI runtime service supporting.
