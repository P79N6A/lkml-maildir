As I wrote below the sysrq-t, switch to noop didn't help, but it seems
that it's harder to reproduce with that:
<cite it's_bad_to_write_anything_below_logs="true">
Note that yum works on lvm on raid0 and git too, but on the another md volume.
Both ext3s. Drivers are sata_promise and ata_piix (sata disk); CFQ scheduler.
Using noop is no change (but seems to be harder to reproduce with it). I figured
out that it probably happens when 2+ processes are on both "processors" (HT on
P4) and are IO wait (multiload-applet shows red above the half).
Swap usage is 0 all the time.

Ok, I'll try to play with that...
