Maybe we should be faking this out from our hotplug scripts in the 
control VM, although triggering this from user space is probably a bit 
of a pain. Regardless, the function can be removed from the driver if 
it's too distasteful: it's only a performance 'hack' to get network 
traffic more quickly redirected when migrating a VM between physical 
hosts. Things won't break horribly if it's removed.
