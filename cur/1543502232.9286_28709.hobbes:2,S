     I'm interested in consistant interfaces;  in my experience, having
     documents behave differently when you access them from different
     shells is a good recipe for making me dislike the platform (like my
     discovery that the MacOS's much-trumpeted-as-better-than-Unix
     undelete didn't work from a shell.)

     There's a difference from not hiding information from the persistant
     and going out of your way to have a neolithic interface because it's
     easier than thinking.

     I don't think you've been paying attention to this argument.  The
     proposal, which has been beaten around the block by traditionalists
     because it's not the way it's done in THEIR village, is to have a
     magic directory (qv: podfuk, if I understand it correctly) that
     is treated like an ordinary file for most operations, but you can
     cd into it via some means and access the gory details using normal
     tools.

     No, you're not paying attention.  Right now, the traditionalists
     are objecting strenuously to magic directories because people can
     modify their applications and some selected GUI to understand
     resource forks for application X (this is the Apple style of
     design:  "We have the one true way of dealing with computers, and
     you are DAMNED TO HELL if you dare treat the Holy Mac any other
     way!"   Well, if I wanted VMS with a GUI, I'd not be posting to the
     linux kernel mailing list.) I DONT WANT TO REWRITE ANYTHING EXCEPT
     THE APP;  I want everything else to be able to treat the document
     as an atomic file, except when they explicitly want to treat it as
     a directory.
     Is it doable?  Maybe.  A proof of concept already exists (podfuk),
     and such a thing may be implementable in userspace.  The stumbling
     point would be the semantics for presenting the data as both a flat
     file and a directory.

     If the ``Unix way'' has changed from using simple tools to do the
     job to having every application carry around a complicated
     infrastructure to access record-format files, well, yes, I'm not
     talking about the ``Unix way''.   I prefer to do things the way
     Unix used to do things, where the kernel provided services in such
     a way that you could build up simple tools to get most everything
     done.

     If a user telnets in and manipulates the data, it should behave the
     same way it does when you use the same tools from a windowing
     interface.
