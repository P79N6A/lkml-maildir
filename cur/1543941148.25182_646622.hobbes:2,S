For any action initiated from user space you will not hold mmap sem. So 
you can call the unregister function. Then you need to do a 
synchronize_rcu before freeing the structures.
It is also possible to shut this down outside via f.e. a control thread. 
The control thread can acquire mmap_sem and then unregister the notifier.
Am I missing something?
