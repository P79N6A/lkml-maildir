Subject: What about 32bit uid/gid's?

Can anyone enlighten me about the status/plans of 32 bit uid/gid
support in the kernel?  AFAIK, glibc2 and ext2fs both support 32
bit uids and only the kernel in between does not.  At work, we
have more than 64K "namespace" (we are ISP), and this limitation
prevents us from using Linux for many applications...
