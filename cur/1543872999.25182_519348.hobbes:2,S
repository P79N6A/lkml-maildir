In my case, Doug, it will get invoked 64 times, amanda does a dummy run to 
get an estimate, calculates what to do based on that output which is 32 
runs, 1 per disklist entry and I have 32, and then reruns tar with the 
appropriate level options against each individual disklist entry.
But I'm puzzled a bit, what does the double $$ do?, or it buried someplace 
in the bash manpage?  Its not something I've stumbled over yet.
