Hi Andrew,
This patch series syncs the kernel code with the upcoming fuse-2.6.0
release.
Patches 1-6 are bug fixes and should go into 2.6.19.
Patch 1 fixes a system hang on SMP.  Though triggered very rarely,
this is a serious condition, so I plan submitting this patch to
-stable also.
Patches 7-8 are small updates.
Patches 9-11 add better support for block device based filesystems
(such as ntfs-3g).
Thanks,
Miklos
