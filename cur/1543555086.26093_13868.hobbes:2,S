Hi all,
Using linux-2.4.0-test11-pre7 right now..., here's what i did,
mount /mnt/cdrom
cd /mnt/cdrom
ls
Segmentation fault
ls
*NOT Responding....*
can't kill /sbin/ls
can't umount /mnt/cdrom
ps , shows ;
613 ?        D      0:00 /bin/ls --color=auto -F -b -T 0
           ^^^^^
i didn't want to reboot...
CDRom door is locked..
BTW, what does D mean in ps?
thanks in advance,
