Btw, another bit I really like about the patches is that it make
the page cache size notation actually useful.  People used PAGE_SIZE
and PAGE_CACHE_SIZE totally interchangeable before and created a total
mess.  Getting rid of PAGE_CACHE_SIZE and only use the per-mapping
macros would be a nice cleanup all by iself even without putting the
rest in for now.
