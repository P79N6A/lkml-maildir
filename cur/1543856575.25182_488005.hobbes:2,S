Sorry.
For linux-2.6.19 it was redundant code:
        if (height == 0 && root->rnode)
                return (void **)&root->rnode;
        shift = (height-1) * RADIX_TREE_MAP_SHIFT;
        slot = &root->rnode;
        while (height > 0) {
                ......
        }
        return (void **)slot;
I just find out it is no longer the case for -mm: the function has been heavily
reworked.
So, the patch is no longer valid.
