Hi,
I was wondering if any people might know what is going on here. This
happens in 2.5.62, using CardBus pcmcia support within my kernel and
the latest pcmcia-cs snapshot.
Just to clarify, I have only one wifi card - wlan0.
cardmgr[99]: starting, version is 3.2.4
cs: memory probe 0xa0000000-0xa0ffffff: clean.
cardmgr[99]: socket 0: U.S. Robotics IEEE 802.11b PC-CARD
cardmgr[99]: executing: 'modprobe hostap_crypt'
cardmgr[99]: executing: 'modprobe hostap'
cardmgr[99]: executing: 'modprobe hostap_cs'
hostap_cs: 0.0.0 CVS (Jouni Malinen <jkmaline@cc.hut.fi>)
hostap_cs: index 0x01: Vcc 5.0, irq 3, io 0x0100-0x013f
hostap_cs: Registered netdevice wlan0
wlan0: NIC: id=0x8002 v1.0.0
wlan0: PRI: id=0x15 v0.3.0
wlan0: STA: id=0x1f v1.4.9
cardmgr[99]: executing: './network start wlan0'
Setting up IP spoofing protection: rp_filter.
Configuring network interfaces... spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7.
cardmgr[99]: + Debian network setup
done.
cardmgr[99]: + /sbin/pump -i wlan0
cardmgr[99]: + /sbin/ifup wlan0
cardmgr[99]: + /sbin/ifup: interface wlan0 already configured
cardmgr[99]: socket 1: U.S. Robotics IEEE 802.11b PC-CARD
wlan0: Interrupt, but SWSUPPORT0 does not match: FFFF != 8A32 - card removed?
hostap_cs: index 0x01: Vcc 5.0, irq 5, io 0x0180-0x01bf
hostap_cs: wlan0: resetting card
wlan0: hfa384x_cmd - timeout - reg=0xffff
hostap_cs: first command failed - is the card compatible?
hostap_cs: Initialization failed
hostap_cs: Registered netdevice wlan1
wlan1: NIC: id=0x8002 v1.0.0
wlan1: PRI: id=0x15 v0.3.0
wlan1: STA: id=0x1f v1.4.9
cardmgr[99]: executing: './network start wlan1'
cardmgr[99]: + Debian network setup
cardmgr[99]: + /sbin/pump -i wlan1
It worked well in 2.5.61, I think. What changed? (Actually, in 2.5.60, it
had a different kind of problem, it would recognize the card as a memory_cs
device, but that was fixed.)
Regards
Josh
