In the case of the Attansic L1 ethernet driver, here's what we see:
chipset			kernel arch	MSI functionality
===============		===========	=================
Intel 945G/ICH7		x86_64		yes
Intel 945G/ICH7		i386		yes
Via K8T890		x86_64		yes
Via K8T890		i386		no
I still don't know why, but we get a flood of APIC errors after starting the 
atl1 driver on a Via K8T890 board (Asus M2V, for example) under a 32-bit kernel, 
and *only* under a 32-bit kernel.
