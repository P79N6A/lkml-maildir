Note that _if_ the page is so often accessed that it stays in the TLB, it
won't ever hit the disk. We _will_ do a TLB invalidate when we unmap it,
and it will get re-mapped long before it's written out.
So it's more likely to result in extra soft-faults, but considering that
if the system is paging stuff out we'll almost certainly be doing enough
context switches that the thing doesn't matter.
And avoiding the extra TLB flush (for _every_ page scanned) is noticeable
according to Andrea.
