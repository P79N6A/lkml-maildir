Disagree.  I don't think there's any benefit to anyone for developers to
hide their stuff on remote mailing lists.  Copying lkml increases the
changes that someone will spot a bug or some improvement and it generally
keeps people informed as to what's going on.
yeah, 120,000 messages/year.  But a lot of them are just noise.  Patches
are important.
And I really don't understand this huffy attitude and putting more
roadblocks in the way of our contributors.  People like Bryan are doing a
lot of work to improve Linux and most people are (or should be) grateful
for that and should be prepared to go the extra yard to help them.
