} User space applications _must_ not include kernel headers.  Even
} modutils does not include linux/module.h, it has its own portable
} (kernels 2.0 - 2.4) version.
There are cases where a user-program _must_ include kernel headers.  Some
glibc versions have incorrect values for MCL_* and asm/mman.h has correct
versions.  If you want your mlock call to do anything, you need the kernel
header.
