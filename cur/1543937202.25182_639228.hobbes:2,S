Wow.  I bow before your storehouse of x86 arcana :-)
I guess you're referring to the "BIOS data area," which I'd never
heard of before (but fortunately, Google knows).
What would you think about doing this only for COM1 and COM2?  The
only real value for doing this in the first place is so "console=ttyS0"
always goes to COM1, even if we don't have SERIAL_PORT_DFNS.  User-
space ought to use some sort of udev magic if it cares about persistent
naming.
