I'd go for madvise() -- it's more widespread than disclaim(),
even if details may differ slightly between implementations.
Neither are in the SUS v2 spec, although I don't know about v3.

Why is this a problem? Whether the pages ares freed immediately
or merely marked to be freed at a later time should be of no
relevance to the application, only to the OS. Or are you relying
on the zero-fill-on-demand behaviour? What do you do on other
OSes that don't support this (e.g., Solaris)?
