I'm not sure I've got this right, but looks like that min_t went in after
Zwane Mwaikambo, then <zwane@fsmlabs.com>, whom I am presuming is the same
person as now at <zwane@arm.linux.org.uk>, found a problem with the i386
find_next_bit implementation returning > N when merging i386 cpu hotplug.
See the thread:
  
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/7/31/102
  [PATCH][2.6] first/next_cpu returns values > NR_CPUS
I apparently lobbied at the time to mandate that find_first_bit(..., N)
return exactly N on failure to find a set bit, but gave up, after some
confusions on my part.
Adding Zwane to this thread -- the other participant on that thread,
Bill Irwin, is already on the CC list.
