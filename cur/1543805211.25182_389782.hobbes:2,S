Hi all,
(please CC me)
I got a Radeon 9250 video card with a DVI and a VGA port. The DVI is
connected to my flat panel. The VGA port is connected, too, but to a TV.
I'd like to disable the VGA port, because when it's enabled the tv is
driven at a resolution it doesn't support.
I tried booting with the following parameters:
append="radeonfb.monitor_layout=TMDS,NONE radeonfb.mirror=0"
But there is still a signal on the VGA port. Apologies for taking this
to this list, but I can't find the infos I need on the web, or at least
my code reading skills are not 100% so that I could figure it out by
myself.
Do I need to change my boot parameters or does it need a change to the
driver code?
Thank you
Sebastian
