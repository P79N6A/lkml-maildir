neat.  Sometimes this can be a device driver failure.

Yeah, I expect quite a few people will start seeing that.  iirc it was
triggered by a couple of changes: a local_irq_save/local_irq_restore in
sched_clock() and a change Jeremy made to the softlockup detector.
There was no reasonable explanation why either of those changes should have
triggered the six failures so I just went ahead with them so we can flush
the real bug out.
