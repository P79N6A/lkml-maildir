I'd expect that, for example, reordering the startup sequence could also
be usefully pulled out into a separate patch.

Well, it matchs the clock API and the fact that there isn't an explicit
check for a NULL dev along with the check for a NULL id.  :)

I'd not be surprised, I doubt it's ever been checked.

Ideally everything should use a device but sadly it's not universal yet.

None that I am aware of.  However, there's an i.MX31 cpufreq driver
queued on merging of the clock API support required (plus a non-cpufreq
implementation of DVFS for the same CPU which also uses the regulator
API).

I'd actually given some consideration to such regulators - while it's a
*bit* of an abuse of the API the fact that voltages are specified as
limits could probably be used somewhat idiomatically for the purpose,
especially if the CPU is controlling things autonomously rather than
having it done by software.  It does need thought, though - that idea is
giving me a bit of ick but it does reflect what's going on.

Well voulunteered :) .

You've adjusted things in the supply registration interface and get() in
this way as well and at least the change to the "unable to find" message
in get() may not be directly due to the caller (it could be due to a
failure on the part of the board code to register the supply name).

Well, clearly.  The client has no direct control over the constraints.

I don't see handling the error code and explaining why it happend as
being orthogonal here.  My inclination would be to always log at least
constraint and setup errors (since callers are likely to just fail and
it's useful to say why), at least until the API becomes more widely used
since almost everyone is on a learning curve here.  People can enable
DEBUG but it's nice to just give the error.
I can see logging all the enable and disable errors becoming too spammy,
though, since they are much more likely to be retried.

Yes, it's a bit harder to parse wth the reversed test - the change in
idiom raises an eyebrow, especially since we fall through into a case
marked fail for both success and failure.

The point here is the patterns in the code - something that looks
different breaks the flow.
