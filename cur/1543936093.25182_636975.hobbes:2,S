I suggest we try to see the problem differently (and see how far we can
get with this) :
Let's suppose we have a 32 bits cycles counter given by the
architecture. We use the lockless algorithm to extend it to 64 bits : we
therefore have a 64 bits cycle counter that can be read locklessly.
Then, from this 64 bits counter (let's call it "now") (which has the
advantage of never overflowing, or after enough years so nobody
cares...), we can calculate the current time with :
time = base + (now - last) * mul
NTP would adjust time by modifying mul, last and base; base would be
recalculated from the formula with : base + (now - last) * mul each time
we modify the clock rate (mul), we also read the current "now" value
(which is saved as "last"). This would be done system-wide and would be
kept in a data structure separate from the 2 64 bits slots array.
Ideally, this NTP correction update could also be done atomically with a
2 slots array.
Whenever we need to read the time, we then have to insure that the "now"
value we use is consistent with the current NTP time correction. We want
to eliminate races where we would use value from the wrong NTP "window"
with a "now" value not belonging to this window. (an NTP window would be
defined by a tuple of base, last and mul values)
If "now" is lower than "last", we are using an old timestamp with a
new copy of the structure and must therefore re-read the "now" value.
If, when we are about to return the "time" value calculated, we figure
out that the current NTP window pointer have changed, we must make sure
that the time value we are about to return is lower than the new base or
otherwise time could go backward. If we detect that time is higher than
the new base, we re-read the "now" value and re-do the calculation.
Am I only partially crazy ? ;)
