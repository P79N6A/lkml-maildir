No. If there is no problem with important standards it should behave as kernel
2.0.x.
In general it is better not to follow dangling symlinks for actions which
creates new fileystem entries. As symlinks and the referenced file is (in
contrast to hardlinks) really something different, this makes much more sense.
Think of the situation:
	touch a
	ln -s a b
	mkdir c
	rm a
	mkdir c
There is little reason why the second mkdir c should succeed, as the symlink
really was a 'file'.
Following symlinks when creating filesystem objekts makes the secure
cooperation of different unix-users much harder. If even rename would follow
symlinks it would be impossible.
For example: Two collegues both work on a projekt. They share a common directory
foo and a common group. Now person a does not believe that person b wants to do
him something harmfull. On the other hand person a is not shure person b may
not start a trojan horse, i.e.
So how they can cooperate? 2 possibilties: If mkdir (and rename) does not
follow links:
	mkdir b
	touch b/a
	rename b/a a
If only rename is save:
	touch <really random number>
	rename <really random number> a
If even the rename system call follows symlinks it is rather impossible to share
directories in a secure way.
The check for a symlink does not help as the operation is not atomic.
