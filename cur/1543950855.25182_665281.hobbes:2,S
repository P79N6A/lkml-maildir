Agreed. But IO TLB shoot-down/invalidate could be alot cheaper. Intel knows
how to do it for CPU MMU (I hope they do at least given IA64 experience).
IO MMU should be no different (well, not too much different). IOMMU is
like the CPU MMU except it's shared by many IO devices instead of
"one per CPU".

Right. IOVA management is CPU intensive.  But stalling on IO TLB flush
syncronize is a major part, an easy target and should be reduced.
Taking advantage of "warm cache" and other "normal" coding methods
will help minimize the CPU overhead.

I removed stats from the parisc IOMMU code exactly for that reason.
It was useful for evaluating details of specific algorithms (comparative)
but not for runtime benchmarking. I suggest removing that code.

Nice! :)
66/57 == 1.15
72/62 == 1.16
~10% higher throughput with essentially no change in service demand.
But I'm wondering why IOMMU-strict gets better throughput. Something
else is going on here. I suspect better CPU cache utilization and
perhaps lowering the high water mark to 32 would be a test to prove that.
BTW, can you clarify what the units are?
I see "Mps", "Mbs", and "Mbps". Ideally we'd be using
a single unit of measure to compare. "Mpps" would be my preferred one
(Million packets per second) for small, fixed sized packets.
Ditch the "debug" code (stats pr0n) and I'll bet this will go up
a few more percentage points and reduce the service demand.
