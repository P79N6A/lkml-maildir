Thanks, Steve.
I didn't have time to try it myself yet, but a kind soul tried it for me.
He used 2.6.28-rc4 and was immediately able to trigger the bug by just:
cd /debug/tracing
echo 0 > tracing_enabled
echo 200 > trace_entries
Then he applied the patch you referred to, and the bug is still present.
He has a 32-bit x86 amd system, and I'm on x86_64.
I don't know why you couldn't reproduce it, maybe you have all the tracers
enabled in the kernel config, when we only have MMIOTRACE.
I can't promise to look into this deeper in the near future :-/
