Yes, I switched the check because the old one didn't work with the new
capability representation.
However, I had not thought this aspect of this replacement through. At
the time, it seemed obvious but in this case it actually depends on
whether you think using privilege (PF_SUPERPRIV) means "benefited from
privilege", or "successfully completed a privileged operation".
I suspect, in this case, the correct thing to do is add the equivalent of:
#define CAPABLE_PROBE_ONLY(a,b)   (!security_capable(a,b))
and use that in the code in question. That is, return to the old
behavior in a way that will not break if we ever need to add more bits.
Thanks for finding this.
Cheers
Andrew
