 The file script/gzparam.c is only related to GZIP by the
fact that the text line printed on stdout will be inserted
into the linux.kgz file as a GZIP comment, it has nothing to
do with the GZIP format itself.
 If you make and execute this gzparam manually, you will
see a line (depending on .config) printed on stdout like:
min_gujin_version=0x102 maskcpu=0x800000F0 maskDflags=0x021 \
   loadadr=0x100000 maskvesa=0x...
 gzparam means: kernel parameters to be inserted in the
comment line of the GZIP kernel file - to get a linux.kgz
 The file script/gzcopy.c would be better distributed in a
GZIP package if there was one such package and everybody
upgrades this package before trying to compile the kernel.
 But that file can also be considered as a better way than
using a script with sed/awk/cut/cat - its basic use is a
single string manipulation (initialise and concatenate
text strings - and insert it in a file at a defined offset).
 This utility is not made to evolve at all, and is so simple
it does not worth bothering - a bit like:
Linux/arch/i386/boot/tools/build.c .
 Note that I also send a message to jloup at the GZIP
homepage, but I am not sure I want to add another dependency
on GZIP package to build the kernel.
 Etienne.
