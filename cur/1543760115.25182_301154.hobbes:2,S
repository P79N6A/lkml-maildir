Agree, purely cosmetic.

Absolutely right. I am afraid, I introduced this bug (which is no worse than 
the bug I was trying to fix), while I was trying to get the elevator.c to 
print the default selection info correct, when a user uses "elevator=" boot 
parameter.
Please refer to the attachment, which contains an email, and a patch I sent to 
Jens the moment I realised the mistake (unfortunately I had no reply from 
Jens, perhaps he was/is very busy). I acknowledge that it is an ugly fix, for 
it seems silly to use an extra variable. I could not think of a better idea I 
am afraid.
I strongly believe that while elv_register() is the right place to print info 
about an elevator that is being registered, elevator_init() perhaps is the 
right place to print what is the chosen/default elevator. But the catch 22 is 
that elv_init() is called once for every block device, so I cannot see an 
easy solution to print just once.
I will try to think more about it, and if I could come up with a better idea, 
I shall inform you and LKML.
Thank you.
Hari

At a cost of one extra variable, this one works great for all cases:
Hopefully the extra steps in elevator_init() won't hinder the performance, as 
elevator_init() seems to be the safest place to determine the default 
elevator, as all elevators are registered, when it is called.
Sorry if it is no good.
Thank you.
Hari.
