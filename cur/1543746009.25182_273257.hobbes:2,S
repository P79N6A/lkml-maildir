Merging can only happen if the two pages becomes equal
again.  That is extremely unlikely, and checking for this
would cost a lot more than the memory saved.

Of course not - the whole reason for copying is so such
modifications won't be visible for the other process. 
There may be special cases (shared mapping) where one
process is supposed to see updates done by another - but
then no COW is performed because there is no need.
