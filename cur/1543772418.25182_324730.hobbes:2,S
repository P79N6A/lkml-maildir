Please don't remove the !CONFIG_DEVFS_FS dummies from devfs_fs_kernel.h.
I'm sure some driver maintainers will want to keep the functions in 
their code because they share their drivers between 2.4 and 2.6 .
Keeping a devfs_fs_kernel.h with dummy functions doesn't hurt, but it 
prevents version #ifdef's in drivers and/or the same dummy functions in 
some subsystem specific headers.
