I'd suggest you first narrow down the problem to either being a
locking problem or a file IO problem. To do that, change lock_fd() in
util.c in ccache to just "return 0;". That will mean the ccache stats
file could become corrupted, but if it runs fast then you know that it
is a locking problem. I have noticed severe speed problem with NFS
locking on Linux previosly, which is why I mention this as a
possibility.
Note that removing this locking will not cause ccache to produce
incorrect object files, it will just mean the stats printed with
"ccache -s" may be inaccurate.
Cheers, Tridge
PS: I also wonder why you're not just using distcc. It's usually a lot
more appropriate in a distributed environment.
