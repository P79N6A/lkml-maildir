I could see from a user perspective this might be nice, what about a
filesystem that could plug into any of the standard
compression/decompression and archive utilities, detects what type based
upon the mounted file, and goes out to bz2/gz/tar/zip, etc and handles it?
No need for many filesystem types, if one intelligent one is written.
