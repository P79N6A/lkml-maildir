The conditional compilation is far more obvious to people than subtle
issues with link order. So I prefer to avoid the latter at all costs.
I have to have some conditional compilation in my tree to allow it to
compile under 2.0 uClinux. Admittedly that doesn't have to get into 2.4,
but I obviously prefer the code in 2.4 to be as close to my working copy
as possible.
I'll poke at it and try to come up with a cleaner solution. It may be that
I can shift all the conditional stuff off into the compatmac.h and leave
the 'real' code path in a cleaner state than the current one.

I haven't had problems. But the possibility exists.
