I went to test the fix and first of all went to replicate the problem.
My build has CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA set but the problem does not occur
without the patch. Should I be concerned about this and raise a bug
for that as I would think that means there is a problem that the read
only protection isn't working (this is off Linus' tree synced
tonight).
Patrick - can you test whether this patch fixes your problem? You said
disabling CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA fixed your problem but can you try
re-enabling and testing this patch?
Ian
