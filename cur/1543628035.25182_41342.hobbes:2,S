Alignment and concatenation are different things altogether. On the whole I
can blast 64K chunks on a 512 byte alignment out of my controllers. The
partitioning doesn't bother me too much. Do we even want to consider a
device that cannot hit its own sector size boundary ?
Oh and the unusual block size stuff seems to be quite easy for the bottom
layers. The horror lurks up higher. Most file systems can't cope (doesn't
matter too much), isofs can be mixed block size (bletch) but the killer
seems to be how you mmap a file on a device with 2326 byte sectors sanely..
(Just say no ?)
