Unless a design change is made: One could argue for a semantics where
write-locking _isn't_ deterministic and thus do not have to boost all the
readers. Readers boost the writers but not the other way around. Readers
will be deterministic, but not writers.
Such a semantics would probably work for a lot of RT applications
happening not to take any write-locks - these will in fact perform better. 
But it will give the rest a lot of problems.
