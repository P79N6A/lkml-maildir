           Summary: 3c905B Driver Doesn't work in 2.6.0_test2
    Kernel Version: 2.6.0_test2

Software Environment: 
Problem Description:
   dmesg displays my 3com 3c905B in dmesg.  Upon booting the OS and trying
unsuccessfully to get a DHCP address, a tried a static IP without any luck also.
 This computer has ran 2.4.20 and .21 alright with this particular driver.  I'm
not sure how t3reproduce:
  1. Get a 3C905B Network Card
  2. Install 2.6.0_test2
     a. Doesn't matter if driver is a module or in the kernel
  3. Assign and IP or try using DHCP
  4. Failure on pings to local computers on the LAN and a failure to get an IP
address.
