Hm, the USB error numbers are listed/documented in
linux/Documentation/usb/error-codes.txt (by name).
Look in include/<asm-arch>/errno.h to match names to values
(or include/asm-generic/errno.h).
-110 for x86 is -ETIMEDOUT (USB returns negative error numbers).
It can mean that the device just wasn't responding, or it can mean
that there is a problem with USB interrupt routing.  There is lots
of work going on in this area right now, especially related to ACPI
interrupt routing.
