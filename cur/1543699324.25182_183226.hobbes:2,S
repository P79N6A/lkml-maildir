Have you ever played roleplaying games?  Almost every rule system has
gray areas that could be exploited by the player.  But if you really
try to do it, the game master will simply notice that - as unlikely as
it sounds - a meteor just landed on your head and you are dead.
Try to use /proc/kcore to load kernel modules through a gray area and
the game master (aka judge) will notice.  Use it to check the kernel
version and noone cares.  So common sense applies again, no matter how
tricky your questions are.
