I think this comment is accurate and understandable, and I am not suggesting
to change it.
However, please note that PF_FREEZER_SKIP can be used not only for vfork().
For example, it seems to me we can also use freezer_...count() to solve the
problem with coredump. We can use the same "wait_for_completion_freezable"
pattern in exit_mm() and in coredump_wait(). (i do not claim this is a best
fix though).
Oleg.
