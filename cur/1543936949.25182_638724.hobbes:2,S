will send it later in another private mail, actually nothing spectacular. The
early_printk() is simply missing for 32bit powerpc. The 64bit implementation
puts a dummy for early_printk in setup_64.c:
~ grep -A 4 EARLY_PRINTK ./arch/powerpc/kernel/setup_64.c | head -6
#ifdef CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK
void notrace early_printk(const char *fmt, ...)
{
        BUG();
	}
	#endif /* CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK */
;-)
that could be why it works for you.

ah, thx for the hint. I took a look in the entry_64.S file. The checking of
mcount_enabled is indeed literally the same as the 32bit architecture.
An important point for the failure on 32bit machines is that due to my bdi the
machine got stuck still before the mmu is running. Hence I get quite funny pc
address like
Current PC        : 0x000135dc
it still lies over on 0x0 as the physical adress of the decompressed kernel in
memory. I think that mcount_enabled is linked somewhere in the virtual addess
space, so that the cmpwi stucks forever for _mcount is called so early, that we
still don't work with virtual addresses. I don't understand enough powerpc
assembler to work out how the LOAD_REG_ADDR() (used in entry_64.S to load
mcount_enabled) of 64 bit powerpcs work around this problem. Anyway, If my guess
is right, we might need something to get or simply ignore mcount_enabled
checking in the _mcount calls during early initialisation.
