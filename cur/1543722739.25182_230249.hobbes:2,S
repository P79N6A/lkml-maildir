But, this code is just for i386 processors.  Do you have a NUMA AMD i386
system?

OK, I'll revise and say that it's impossible for all of the in-tree NUMA
systems.  I'd heavily encourage you to post your code so that we can
more easily understand what kind of system you have.  It's very hard to
analyze impact on systems that we've never seen code for.
In any case, I believe that the original loop should be kept pretty
close to what is there now:
        for (tmp = 0; tmp < max_low_pfn; tmp++)
                /*
                 * Only count reserved RAM pages
                 */
                if (page_is_ram(tmp) && PageReserved(pfn_to_page(tmp)))
                        reservedpages++;
If you do, indeed, have non-ram pages between pfns 0 and max_low_pfn,
I'd suggest doing something like this:
                if (page_is_ram(tmp) && 
		    node_online(page_to_nid(tmp)) &&
                    PageReserved(pfn_to_page(tmp)))
                        reservedpages++;
That's a lot cleaner and more likely to work than replacing the entire
loop with an ifdef.
