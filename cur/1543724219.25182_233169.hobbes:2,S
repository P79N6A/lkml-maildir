On 2.6 you're not really supposed to do IDE-SCSI emulation anymore.  Most 
software can now use the plain IDE interface, just by telling it to 
use /dev/hdc.  So try compiling ide-scsi as a module or not at all and not 
loading it.  This may not solve the problem, but it might make error recovery 
cleaner.

The ability to monopolize a market is insignificant next to the power of the 
source.
