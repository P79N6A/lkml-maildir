The allocation function should be safe, since it only gives majors
which are not assigned in devices.txt. Drivers which statically grab
unassigned majors are broken, and *will* trip over each other at some
point.
As I said before, I can move the major allocation function into a
generic place and not have it depend on CONFIG_DEVFS_FS. So it doesn't
have to matter if RH ship devfs or not.
BTW: please Cc: me, otherwise I may not see responses.
