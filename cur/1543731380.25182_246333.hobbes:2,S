Hello,
just a 'me too' e-mail... I have Master2-FAR mobo, VIA/KT800 chipset.
IDE disk runs like a charm but SATA disks consume big amount of cpu
time (which is spent in iowait). The system behaves exactly as with
old IDE disk and DMA disabled... everything is slow when data is 
transferred to/from disk.
I have played with various settings, io schedulers, acpi... but haven't
found anything useful so far..
Regards,
Petr
