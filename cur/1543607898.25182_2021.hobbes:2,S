Hello,
Does anyone except me still having problems with the eepro100 drivers ?
The network connection stalls and I'll get this message:
eepro100: wait_for_cmd_done timeout!
I am using the eepro100 drivers with my 100/10 card running in
10mbit and it works in windows.
I have been trying all new kernels + the ac patches but nothing
seems to work. The fun thing is that I only gets this problem
when I am running XFree, is this just a weird coincidence?
