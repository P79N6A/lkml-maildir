It makes sense indeed.
That would mean to have something like this, right ?
struct ipc_namespace {
	struct kref	kref;
	struct ipc_ids	sem_ids;
	int		sem_ctls[4];
	int		used_sems;
	struct ipc_ids	msg_ids;
	int		msg_ctlmax;
	int		msg_ctlmnb;
	int		msg_ctlmni;
	atomic_t	msg_bytes;
	atomic_t	msg_hdrs;
	struct ipc_ids	shm_ids;
	size_t		shm_ctlmax;
	size_t		shm_ctlall;
	int		shm_ctlmni;
	int		shm_tot;
};
After a quick look, that implies to rework a little bit procfs... othwise, it's
not a big deal as I can see.
