You're lucky.
Nvidia drivers are broken, and it's not just linux. Their windows drivers
are know to be buggy, too. And this is happening in windows (which has a
"windows driver model" abi which doesn't change even between W9x and nt)
Also, they don't support non-x86 architectures in linux (they have drivers
for mac os X though)
If there're a lot of binary drivers for linux, we'll have the same hell
microsoft has (w2k and XP are rock solid, until you start using crappy
drivers, then everybody complains about blue screens). A stable and defined
abi (like their driver model) doesn't work for them, it won't work for us. 
I don't mind running propietary code...but not in the kernel.
(BTW, are there modern graphics cards with 100% opensource drivers?)
