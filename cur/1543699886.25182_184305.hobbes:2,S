No, but the user does, and if the machine in question boots fast
enough that interrupts are disabled less than two seconds after the
last BIOS floppy access, they should currently avoid configuring the
BIOS in such a way that it accesses floppy drive if there is not going
to be any code to turn it off, which currently means having floppy
support compiled in, (or as a module).

The code that took control is the bootloader, which may never load a
Linux kernel.  Imagine a theoretical future bootloader which disabled
interrupts, thereby stopping the two second floppy motor timeout, and
offered things such as a serial console, monitor, or other diagnostic
features.

Possibly, but I still consider the BIOS configuration broken if there
are infact any loose-ends to tie up.

At the end of the day, though, I agree that it's the best way to fix
it, but we shouldn't convince ourselves that it's particularly
elegant.
