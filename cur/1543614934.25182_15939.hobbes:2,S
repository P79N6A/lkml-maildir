I personally think the merging is distributed, and done by each
subsystem maintainer.  When that doesn't happen, and the merge is
non-trivial, we often see a message by Linus essentially saying "your
patch is cool, but it conflicts with another patch by <foo> that does
<bar>, so I've done a new pre with <foo>'s patch, could you merge and
rediff against it?".
