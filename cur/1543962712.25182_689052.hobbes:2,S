Also, no platform can set HAVE_STABLE_CLOCK until we instantiate it in
a Kconfig somewhere.  I've choosen to do it in kernel/Kconfig.hz and
here are the sparc/sparc64 bits as well, I've booted this up with
Peter's patch on my 64-cpu niagara2 box and done some basic testing.
It would be nice if a powerpc person could test the trivial
powerpc Kconfig patch.
Possibly this should be HAVE_UNSTABLE_CLOCK, then only one platform
needs to set it :-)
