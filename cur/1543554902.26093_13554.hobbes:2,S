Just check all the flags and fall back to the code not using the feature 
if any doesn't support it.

That would strike me as overkill.

Generally it is probably a rare case, otherwise there would be more bug reports
on it (because e.g. for the FXSR case a lot of SSE supporting kernels panic
on boot)
