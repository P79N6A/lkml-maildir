Hello,
sorry for posting this message to your list ....
But I think it's a kernel issue:
We run SuSE SLES with SAP certified Kernel 2.4.18-64GB-SMP on a 2-way Intel
P3 server (Hewlett Packard).
We had the following problem:
The systems runs without any problems for a period of time (2 to 7 days).
But then the sytem date gets stucked in a loop.
=> After 3 seconds the time starts to loop.
For example:
Tue Dec 3 15:20:12 CET 2002 
Tue Dec 3 15:20:13 CET 2002 
Tue Dec 3 15:20:14 CET 2002 
Tue Dec 3 15:20:12 CET 2002 
.......
the hwclock is still running.
If you set the time via "date" to the actual time
it loops in the acutal time (in between of 3 seconds)
Tue Dec 3 15:30:44 CET 2002 
Tue Dec 3 15:30:45 CET 2002 
Tue Dec 3 15:30:46 CET 2002 
Tue Dec 3 15:30:44 CET 2002 
...
Using NTP/XNTP doesn't help ....
