The two motherboards with ADM1026 I know of are (actually thanks to the
MBM site):
Iwill DK8S2
Accelertech HDAMA
I think I remember you ship HDAMA boards, right? Well, there must be a
reason why you (Penguin Computing) wrote the driver in the first place
and recently ported it to 2.6.
What I want to insist on is that, contrary to other chips which are used
on a wide range of different boards, the ADM1026 isn't so we can
concentrate of the specific use it has on these boards instead of
writing a full-featured driver.

Ah, good question. Checking...
Hm, no it doesn't. The module parameters change the decision taken by
i2c_detect on each adapter/address combination, but doesn't affect the
order in which the chips are detected.

Side note, it would probably be better to insist that the vendor should
fix the BIOS instead. Especially if you ship hundreds of these chips
each months, I guess you have some weight when asking them something.
Does you board really have 2 ADM1026 chips and only one needed
reprogramming?

Agreed, but...

True. But again, do you have boards with *2* ADM1026 chips? Until
someone points out one boards which does, I see no benefit in
implementing this module parameter.
One question BTW, why don't you simply reprogram the chip(s) with i2cset
before loading the driver? That would save some kernel memory, and
solves the problem altogether.
Thanks,
