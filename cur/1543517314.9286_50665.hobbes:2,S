OK, here is an example based on Solaris:
You have an /etc/devlink.tab file.
A device driver would have a file something like:
type=ddi_pseudo;name=pci108a,1 \M0
type=ddi_pseudo;name=pci108a,2 \M0
type=ddi_pseudo;name=pci108a,3 \M0
type=ddi_pseudo;name=SBSE,NanoBus \M0
And if a grep for "name=pci108a,1" failed, they would
cat my_devlink.tab >>etc/devlink.tab
Then you do:
add_drv -i '"pci108a,1" "SBSE,NanoBus"' btp
It automatically looks for an executable btp and configuration btp.conf file
in /kernel/drv/.
The file /etc/system allows you to add a line like "forceload: drv/btp" to
force the driver to load.
Permissions are given on the add_drv line.
That is how Solaris basically does it.
I would suggest it is probably easier to just have the /etc/devlink file
allow you to parse a PCI vendor,device,sub-vendor,sub-device and associate a
driver file with it.
Something like:
pci 108a,1 btp "SBS Technologies, Inc PCI to VMEbus Adapter"
Format is:
pci
^- bus type
108a,1
^- vendor,device, optional sub-vendor and sub-device
btp
^- driver name, with an assumed default location. Installation program looks
for both the driver configuration file (btp.conf) and the driver (btp.o) in
the same location.
"SBS Technologies, Inc PCI to VMEbus Adapter"
^- verbose text string defining exactly what the device is.
Make sure you define some sort of comment character for the file, so that
people can add notes where necessary.
Hopefully this makes it lots clearer.
