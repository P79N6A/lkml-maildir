After studying the code for two evenings, I'm quite sure it does that
already.
A comment in ohci-hcd.c:ohci_restart reads:
  /* mark any devices gone, so they do nothing till khubd disconnects.
   * recycle any "live" eds/tds (and urbs) right away.
   * later, khubd disconnect processing will recycle the other state,
   * (either as disconnect/reconnect, or maybe someday as a reset).
   */
usb_root_hub_lost_power marks the ports as gone, khubd will disconnect them.
After restarting the chip, khubd will cause them to be detected again.
This is also what I can watch in the logs:
  ohci_hcd 0001:10:15.1: OHCI Unrecoverable Error, scheduling NEC chip restart
  usb usb2: root hub lost power or was reset
  usb 2-2: USB disconnect, address 2
  input: appletouch disconnected
  usb 2-2: new full speed USB device using ohci_hcd and address 3
  usb 2-2: configuration #1 chosen from 1 choice
  input: Apple Computer Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad as /class/input/input16 on usb-0001:10:15.1-2
  input: appletouch as /class/input/input17
  input: Apple Computer Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad as /class/input/input18 on usb-0001:10:15.1-2
(Actually, I added some code to trigger the error handling code, reliably
reproducing it otherwise is impossible.)
Thanks,
Michael
