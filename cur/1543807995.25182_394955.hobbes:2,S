It's an incompatibility in a later rework of serio.h/serport.c.
SERIO_RS232 used to be 0x02000000, now the constant isn't shifted up
anymore, which messed up things. Also, the type used to be possible to
set, but I don't think that needs to be fixed, since there are so far no
ttys that'd need a different serio type. 
I'll apply your fix to inpuatttach. Thanks for spotting the bug.
