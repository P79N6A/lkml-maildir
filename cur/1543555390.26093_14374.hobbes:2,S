ok, Dave. But the code in dev_ioctl() actually is :
  rtnl_lock();
  ret = dev_ifsioc(&ifr, cmd);
  rtnl_unlock();
if only these lock/unlock guarantee this atomicity, then I can't
see why my A,B,C case could not work. If this is because the
kernel has been locked somewhere else, then why are the locks
still needed ? The author of rtnetlink.h has been very precautious
about the atomicity of these locks when CONFIG_RTNETLINK is set. I
don't understand why this could change in other cases. For this
reason, I don't know what to write in my code ...
Regards,
Willy
