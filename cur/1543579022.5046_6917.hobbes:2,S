I have been working on some changes to page_launder() which
might just fix this problem. Quick and dirty patches are on
my home page and I'll try to clean things up and make something
correct & clean later today or tomorrow ;)

One problem is that these tasks may be waiting on kswapd when
kswapd might not get scheduled in on time. On the one hand this
will mean lower load and less thrashing, on the other hand it
means more IO wait.
This is another area where we may be able to improve some things.
(btw, according to Alan the 2.4 kernel is the first one to break
the 1.2 kernel compiling speed record on an 8MB machine he has ;))
cheers,
