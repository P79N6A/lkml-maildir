Here's my personal favorite, file 490 of 591.  
See if you can spot the purloined Intellectual Property:
[steven@spc 2.6-bk-current]$ cat include/asm-v850/percpu.h
#ifndef __V850_PERCPU_H__
#define __V850_PERCPU_H__
#include <asm-generic/percpu.h>
/* This is a stupid hack to satisfy some grotty implicit include-file
   dependency; basically, <linux/smp.h> uses BUG_ON, which calls BUG, but
   doesn't include the necessary headers to define it.  In the twisted
   festering mess of includes this must all be resolved somehow on other
   platforms, but I haven't the faintest idea how, and don't care; here will
   do, even though doesn't actually make any sense.  */
#include <asm/page.h>
#endif /* __V850_PERCPU_H__ */
I'm betting on the "This is a stupid hack" phrase.  Undoubtably SCO's code
is littered with comments like that.
