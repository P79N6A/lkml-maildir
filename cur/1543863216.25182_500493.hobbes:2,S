The obvious solution is: Don't make them setuid root.
Then this issue disappears.
If there is some strong reason why they need to be setuid root, then
you'll need to explain that reason and your requirements in more detail.
But, based on your explanation so far, I have serious doubts about
whether it is a good idea to make such core-dumps setuid root in the
first place.
