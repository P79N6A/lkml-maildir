AFAIR __extension__ was gcc specific.
Does the Sun cc provide options for strict C90 checking?
And if yes, what is it's syntax for disabling this checking for a line 
of code?

AFAIR the Intel compiler claims to be gcc.
But these are by far not the only C compilers under Linux, and the more 
important points are:
Is there any userspace Linux compiler that does not support "long long"?
If yes, is there any other way to tell that something is a
64bit int on 32bit architectures?
