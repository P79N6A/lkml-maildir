It's only true for the pages the munmap() removes from the process' page 
tables: the act of unmapping them transfers the dirty bit from the page 
tables into the page cache where fsync() acts on them.

Pretty much.

Right.  Other processes are responsible for managing their own syncing of 
dirty bits to disk at the appropriate times.  The one case this breaks down 
on is when the mmap()'d file is on NFS -- the reordering there can result in 
writebacks from mmap()s occuring in unexpected ways.  But then, nobody trusts 
their data to NFS, right?  ;-)
