I have found that if the bios setting :-
"MPS Version Control for OS"
is set to 1.4, then the usb stuff appears to not receive any interrupts. If
set it to 1.1 then all is fine.
I assume that no interrupts is the problem, i get a load of timed out
messages and an error 110.
Is this a known thing ? I noticed that it also allocates interrupts
differently, ie my tv card gets assigned irq 9 when MPS is set to 1.1
as below, but when its set to 1.4 then it gets assigned to IRQ 18.
