I haven't looked into how they do it.  It could be as simple as mapping the
memory region, then forking all the processes that use it.  Or they could
be communicating the mapped address to the other processes dynamically via
some other mechanism.  All I know is the memory ends up being mapped at the
same address in all processes.
Or are you saying using the same address is a bad thing even if it's
determined at runtime?
