This looks like standard SMB garbage. It probably repeats on a regular
basis. From what I remember, I think it is a Windows box browsing
the network trying to discover other SMB boxes, finding a 'master
browser', and other such stuff.
I see it all the time when there are Windows machines about, and I'm
running tcpdump.
I imagine that someone who knows better, such as the Samba guys, would be
able to tell you exactly whats going on, and maybe some other interesting
tidbits of information.
(I hate SMB ... its really chatty ...)
