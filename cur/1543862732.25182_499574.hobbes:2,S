The global dirty limit definitely seems to be a problem
in several cases, but my feeling is that the cpuset is the wrong unit
to keep track of it. Most likely it should be more fine grained.

Is there any indication this change helps on smaller systems
or is it purely a large system optimization?

That sounds like a useful change by itself.
