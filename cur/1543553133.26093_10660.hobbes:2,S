Is there any documentation about the Tux zero-copy implementation so
that I don't have to read half of the 2.4 kernel sources before having a
clue? 
Are the kernel changes going to be in the mainstream kernel?
Does Tux implement a new interface so that a userspace app can do
zero-copy stuff with the network?
Sorry for the newbie questions, but it's really hard to find information
about Tux (other than the holy source code, of course ;-)
TIA
