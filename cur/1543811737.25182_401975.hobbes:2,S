Nitin Gupta and myself has already started working on a implementation
for 2.6, you are of course welcome to join our effort. Nitin has already
made some code available where you can clearly see where such things
could be done. I can recommend "Understanding the Linux kernel (3rd
Edition)" by Daniel P. Bovet & Marco Cesati. Also, you could take a look
at 
http://www.kernelnewbies.org/
 under recommended books.
Mvh,
