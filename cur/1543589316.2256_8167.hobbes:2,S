Howdy J.A.,
	Let me ask a possibly stupid question... How do you tell
what version of the Gibbs Adaptec driver you're using?  Did I
misunderstand you when you said the 2.4.4 kernel is using 6.1.5?
Also, did I understand you to say the 6.1.12 version will fix
my unresolved symbol problem?
Thanks,
Steve

I have seen blaming for this error to aic7xxx new driver prior to version
6.1.11. It was included in the 2.4.3-ac series, but its has not got into
main 2.4.4 (there is still 6.1.5). Everything needs its time.
Grab the updated patch from people.freebsd.org/~gibbs/linux.
BTW (Alan?) new version is 6.1.12 (just patched 2.4.4 after offset
engineering and works fine).
Candidate for 2.4.4-ac1 or 2.4.5-pre1 ?
