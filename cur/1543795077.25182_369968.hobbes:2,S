Well, it certainly looked like a serial port when it was probed - to the
extent that even loopback mode worked.  Hence I'd be very surprised if
it wasn't there.
It's the same test that's being applied as has been for the last 14
years to detect if a port is present or not.  Maybe Ted T'so would
be aware if it can optimistically discover ports?
