Subject: drivers/acpi/video.c: null pointer dereference

The Coverity checker found the following null pointer dereference in 
drivers/acpi/video.c:
<--  snip  -->
...
static int
acpi_video_switch_output(
...
{
...
        struct acpi_video_device *dev=NULL;
...
        list_for_each_safe(node, next, &video->video_device_list) {
                struct acpi_video_device * dev = container_of(node, struct acpi_video_device, entry);
...
        }
...
        switch (event) {
        case ACPI_VIDEO_NOTIFY_CYCLE:
        case ACPI_VIDEO_NOTIFY_NEXT_OUTPUT:
                acpi_video_device_set_state(dev, 0);
                acpi_video_device_set_state(dev_next, 0x80000001);
                break;
        case ACPI_VIDEO_NOTIFY_PREV_OUTPUT:
                acpi_video_device_set_state(dev, 0);
                acpi_video_device_set_state(dev_prev, 0x80000001);
...
<--  snip  -->
Two different variables of the same name within 40 lines of code are a 
good indication that something's wrong...
The outer "dev" variable is never assigned any value different from 
NULL.
acpi_video_device_set_state dereferences this variable.
