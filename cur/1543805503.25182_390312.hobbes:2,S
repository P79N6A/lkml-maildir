Dear list,
I have framebuffer problems with vanilla 2.6.15.1 - its very slow.
I'm using vesafb and booting with 'vga=795'.
I've used 2.6.11.12 before, and running 'cat
/usr/share/man/man1/bash.1' on tty1 took
12 seconds. Now, with 2.6.15.1 it takes 3 minutes.
Now the details of 2.6.15.1 system:
During boot I have:
PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #6:20000@f8000000 for 0000:40:00.0
relevant snip of the .config
#
# Graphics support
#
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_CFB_FILLRECT=y
CONFIG_FB_CFB_COPYAREA=y
CONFIG_FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT=y
CONFIG_FB_MODE_HELPERS=y
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT=y
And as I've said, I boot with 'vga=795'. Graphics card is Nvidia
Quadro FX1500 (PCIE).

No 'write-combining' entry! But with 2.6.11.12 I do have one:
<2.6.11.12 system> cat /proc/mtrr

reg05: base=0xf0000000 (3840MB), size= 128MB: write-combining, count=1
Where to continue to?
P.S. I'm not on the list, so please CC me.
