Indeed. The symptoms are that X stops drawing the background to windows, 
and it seems to be very strongly tied to saving the state while X is 
running (even if X is not currently the foreground VT).

For machines where nothing is listed, we do POSTing and restore the VBE 
state. These may not be necessary in all cases, but they don't seem to 
be actively harmful except on the machines where they're explicitly
