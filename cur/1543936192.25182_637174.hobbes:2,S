the guys who design the silicon are telling us it doesnt work.  our
tests show it not working.  i'm not sure what else you want here.

not in the least actually.  we just started developing the driver.  it
has seen no real world use.  we've been testing things internally to
make sure the setup is sane.  4-bit MMC is coming up as not working.
