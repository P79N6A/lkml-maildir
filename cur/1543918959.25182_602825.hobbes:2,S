hm, i'm not convinced about this one. It increases the code size a bit 
and it's a sched.c local hack. If then this should be done on a generic 
infrastructure level - lots of other code (VFS, networking, etc.) could 
benefit from it i suspect - and then should be .configurable as well. 
Then the benefit might become measurable too.
