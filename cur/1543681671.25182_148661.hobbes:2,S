While trying to figure out why my SCSI modules don't autoload
properly in 2.6.0-test1 and late 2.5 kernels, I found that
patch-2.5.71 removed scsi.c's request_module("scsi_hostadapter").
It seems that some driver model conversion changed scsi_register_device()
to scsi_register_{driver,interface}(), but the latter don't do
anything wrt autoloading the host adapter.
Is this an oversight or is it intensional?
I can probably work around this through "install" command
kludgery in /etc/modprobe.conf, but that's (a) is ugly, and
(b) probably won't work for configs with built-in SCSI core
but modular host adapter.
