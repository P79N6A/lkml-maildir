Subject: cpufreq driver + wrong cpu time

Hello to everyone.
I have written cpufreq_nForce4 kernel driver for  cpufreq subsystem.
It allows for CPU frequency changing by adjusting FSB speed, for nForce4
based motherboards. 
Works for single-cpu systems, as well as for SMP.
The problem is, after changing CPU(s) speed on SMP systems, programs
report wrong cpu time (wall time is OK). 
What would be the best way to fix this, and shouldn't this be done by
the cpufreq subsystem, rather than by hardware driver? 
P.S
Please include me in the CC explicitly!
Best Regards,
Alexander Shaposhnikov
