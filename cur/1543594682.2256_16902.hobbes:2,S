My VLAN code creates an entry for every vlan in /proc/net/vlan/
too, and it seems to quit creating entries after about 250 or so.
It's read-only info, so it doesn't seem to do too much harm.
I think there must be an 8-bit limit somewhere in the proc-fs.

It definately isn't fast, but then again, it is fast enough when you
only have 500 or so interfaces.  For the wierdos that want more, we
can just wait a little longer... :)
I'll offer the hashed-device-lookup
patch separately on my web site so it can be used if needed...
