OK, I think I understand.  This is a problem that is more difficult
to solve from a userspace daemon than it is from within the USB
driver itself.  All a userspace component would be able to do
here is assign the appropriate name to the device, and with
devfs the USB driver can do that directly.  The problem is strictly
with USB device naming so devfs is merely one possible solution.

Since devfsd is irrelevant to this problem, so too would be an rc script.
