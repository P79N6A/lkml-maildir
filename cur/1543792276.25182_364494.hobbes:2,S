Subject: [RFC 0/2] Copy on write for hugetlbfs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following two patches implement copy-on-write for hugetlbfs (thus
enabling MAP_PRIVATE mappings).  Patch 1/2 (previously posted by David
Gibson) contains a couple small fixes to the demand fault handler and
makes COW fit in nicely.  Patch 2/2 is the cow changes.  Comments?
