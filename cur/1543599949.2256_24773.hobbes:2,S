With my 7110 I get close to 8000bps throughput . To get that I ended up
having to fix various flow control setting so the tiny buffers on the 
phone didnt keep overflowing

The modem/phone link does its own retransmit and recovery sequences. That
means that on a very flaky link you _will_ see long pauses with retransmits
at link layer going on
