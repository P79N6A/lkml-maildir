Hi,
a couple of answers on the things I still have doubts on. Note 
that I'm using the 2.6.5 as reference. If anything has 
thoroughly changed in 2.6.6 or 7-rc1, just let me know.

By looking at the header files, or into the documentation, I 
have problems finding what keycode is supposed to be assigned 
to have a key act as the corresponding "Microsoft-compatible" 
keyboard.
My thoughts are that, even without an event driver interface 
for X, it is possible to use the present model provided that 
the emulated rawmode provides the widest possible set of 
features provided by the union of 'all' available keyboards. 
With a (possibly documented) set of keycodes that needs to be 
assigned to get this or that function.
With my limited knowledge (i.e. by what I see looking at the 
source files and include headers) I see the kernel lacking in 
two fields:
* X allows for the shift, ctrl, alt, meta, super, hyper (left 
and right) modifiers. In the kernel headers I only see 
references to shift ctrl and alt. (Actually X also has a wild 
bunch of other modifiers for group shift, composition etc.)
* No (documented) set of keycodes to assign to get mapped to 
multimedia/internet keys (volume up/down, play, stop, next, 
prev, email, internet, blah blah blah)
If we want to go the 'full emulation' way, such things must be 
set in a standard, documented way. Which is not the case yet, 
unless I'm just going blind.

And I noticed there was this excellent "keyfuzz" utility 
recently released which is aimed at providing exactly this 
feauture. But it doesn't work as expected. Not yet. Because 
keycodes have to be assigned by trial and error and trying to 
re-do assignments causes strange effects since scancodes start 
shifting as well in a very strange way. Which is why at a 
certain point (over a month now) I just gave up and patched 
atkbd.c directly to have it work with my keyboard.

Of course. But X is what it is and we're stuck in this 
situation.

Setkeycodes works by trial and error. MS-compatible multimedia 
keys scancodes are not exactly well-documented, not anywhere I 
can see. Also, does MS-compatible mutlimedia scancodes emulate 
the whole set of keys some ridiculous humongous keys provide?

Thank you very much :)

It would have been interesting to see the reactions :)
