Am running it on a Dell Latitude D820 (Core2 T7200 cpu).  I had to un-do
4 conflicting patches in -rc1-mm1 and then it applied and ran clean, I still
need to look at re-merging them:
hpet-avoid-warning-message-livelock.patch
clockevents-i386-hpet-driver.patch
get-rid-of-arch_have_xtime_lock.patch
x86_64-mm-amd-tsc-sync.patch
It *looks* like all the pieces are there except a few lines of Kconfig
magic to wire up the dynticks/NO_HZ stuff - or did I miss something crucial?
