I was preparing to do just that, but bumped into a simple problem.
If I patch against Linus tree, then the 3 patches suggested by
Rusty Russell make no sense, because the Linus tree still has stem
compression. So there is no inconsistency bug and there are no
comments to add, there is only a single patch to go from stem
compression to the new compression scheme.
It does not sound so bad to have just one patch that appears at 
2.6.9-rc2 that says "change kallsyms compression scheme", so I 
have no problem producing this patch.
I'm now holding on to avoid start sending patches against
different trees and make a total mess :(
