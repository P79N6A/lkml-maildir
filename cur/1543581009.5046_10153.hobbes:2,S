Why not?
Obviously the disk access itself must be sector aligned and the total
length must be a multiple of the sector length, but there shouldn't be
any restrictions on the data buffers.
I remember that even Windoze 95 has scatter-gather support for physical
disk IO with arbitraty buffer chunks. (If the hardware supports it,
otherwise the io subsystem will copy the data into a contiguous
temporary buffer)
