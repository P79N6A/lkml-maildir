Hi,
 I got one question about unix socket functions. I have two machines (called A 
and B). I use A to telnet B, get the root password of B. Is there any unix 
socket function I can use to get the port number of A on B. Obviously, the 
port number of B is 23. I want to use a socket function implemented on B to 
get the port number of A because a TCP connection is established between them.
  I greatly appreciate it if you help me. Thank you in advance.
