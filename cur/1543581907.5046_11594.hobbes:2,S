I saw/see a lot of those messages on 2.2.18pre19 as well. I hacked the
kernel to show the process in question, and it's always xmms:
LDT allocated for cloned task (pid=20272; count=3)!
20272 pts/10   RN   186:01 xmms
And I do have the xmms-avi plugin in the plugin directory. So if you find a
bug/fix to 2.4, could you please check 2.2 as well? (I'm afraid I'm not
nearly clueful enough.) 
Are these messages serious anyway?
