None of my systems will power down on UP if I enable the "local apic support 
on uniprocessors" option.
Something about the APIC code prevents the power down from occuring.  The 
symptoms are as you describe: the drives spin down, and the power goes off 
immediately if you press the button (instead of having to hold it down), but 
the power doesn't go off by itself.
Works fine if I compile without local APIC support.
