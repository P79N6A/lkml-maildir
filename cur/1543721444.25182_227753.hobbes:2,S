Subject: accelerated radeonfb produces artifacts on scrolling in 2.6.7

The radeonfb driver in 2.6.7 produces some interesting artifacts on
scrolling, both scrolling horizontally and vertically.
When scrolling vertically (in mutt, in slrn, in less) some lines
move horizontally, and corruption occurs. Not all scrolling produces
artifacts, but fairly often.
When scrolling horizontally (most obvious in angband -mcu with the
option 'keep the screen centered' on) corruption appears at once.
Booting with 'noaccel' fixes the problems, but is slow, of course.
