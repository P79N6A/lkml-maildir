You lost files in use, or random files?
Soft Update was designed to assure file system consistency.  In typical
usage, when you drop power on something like FAT, you create a 'hole' in
the filesystem.  This hole could be something like files pointing to
allocated blocks belonging to other files; or crossed dentries; etc.  As
you use the file system, it simply accepts the information it gets,
because it doesn't look bad until you look at EVERYTHING.  The effect is
akin to repeatedly sodomizing the file system in this newly created
hole; you just cause more and more damage until the system gives out.
The system makes allocations and decisions based on faulty data and
really, really screws things up.
The idea of Soft Update was to make sure that while you may lose
something, when you come back up the FS is in a safely usable state.
The fsck only colors in a view of the FS and frees up blocks that don't
seem to be allocated by any particular file, an annoying but mostly
harmless side effect of losing power in this scheme.
