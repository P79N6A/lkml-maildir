When a socket is created, you can optionally bind to local IP, interface and/or
IP-Port.  Somewhere, NFS is opening a socket I assume?  So, is there a way to
ask it to bind?
You can then use this source-IP to convince the routing logic to use a
particular interface (ie, the interface with that IP on it).
Thanks,
Ben
