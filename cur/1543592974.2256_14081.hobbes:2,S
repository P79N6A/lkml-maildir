Sorry, meant to describe both, (natsemi and tulip, but latter
on older DEC chip).

Tried to reproduce this problem last night on my machines
at home (kernel 2.4.4, 500MHz K7/400Mhz K6). Just doing FTP
and netperf tests, didnt see any significant variation between
rcv and tx sides. Admittedly different machines, and between
3C905C and a FA310TX (tulip). However, if the problem
was purely kernel protocol under load, it should have showed. 
Also, am not seeing significant frame errors - 1 in 10K,
definitely not seeing anything remotely like 30%. If 1/3
of your packets are being dropped with frame errs, you'll see
lots of retransmissions, horrible performance, no question. But
I would expect frame errors to be due to things like the
speed not being negotiated correctly(?), or if the board
isnt sitting quite right (true - thats the only experience
I remember of recv code path being error prone compared
to tx), but that should affect all the kernel versions you
ran on that host..
Am pretty clueless about media level issues, but it would
help to identify whats causing the framing errors. 
Not much help, I know..
thanks,
Nivedita
