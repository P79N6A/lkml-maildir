Yeah, it is probably a bit too large here too. A burst of activity
from X can cause xmms to skip slightly. Probably 128 or 64 would
be a decent default.

It usually isn't too bad for desktops, but is more important on
systems with more CPUs and bigger caches.
On this dual P3 with 256K L2 cache, a make -j8 vmlinux uses
162.16user 15.43system, ~150ctxsw/s with base_timeslice = 10000
163.88user 16.16system, ~300ctxsw/s with base_timeslice = 32
192.65user 17.27system, ~1300ctxsw/s with base_timeslice = 1
So you come to the point of diminishing returns very quickly, and
32 or even 16 or 8 are probably fine values for a desktop system
and worth the small cost for CPU intensive tasks.
