Then it's your fault that you forwarded the wrong email - in the email 
you forwarded the only action for which Theo accused the Linux 
developers of breaking the law was for choosing one licence when using 
dual licenced code.

Is it a legal problem or is it "only" an ethical problem?
If choosing one licence when using dual licenced code is not a legal 
problem then Theo repeatedly talking about it would "break the law" in 
the email you forwarded was very unethical and the worst he could do
for his cause.
