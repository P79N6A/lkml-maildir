Think exporting _protocols_ over a network (protocols lend themselves
for this purpose :-). There are user level programs that redirect the
protocol
to access serial ports over the network. Tomorrow you may find a reason
to do the
same with the protocols that control IDE disks.  The issue regarding
being
or not being root on the local machine does not exist here.
I like Andre's perfectionist approach at the protocol level.
