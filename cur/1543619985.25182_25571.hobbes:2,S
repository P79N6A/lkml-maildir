Uhm, no.  The problem with it is that you're using kernel memory
because you're not willing to manage userspace competently, so modules
(in fact, *using modules at all*) would be right out.
I have had in my /sbin/installkernel a clause to save .config as
config-<foo> when I install vmlinuz-<foo>; I believe anyone not doing
that[1] is, quite frankly, a moron.
