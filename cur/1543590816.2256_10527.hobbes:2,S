Description of the problem:
-------------------
 Whenever a hard disk access is attempted, I get the following messages:
hda: dma_intr: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hda: dma_intr: error=0x84 { DriveStatusError BadCRC }
This error did not appear under previous versions of the kernel (2.2.x).
No material modification has been made between 2.2.x and 2.4.x kernel update.
The hard disk does not show any sign of hardware failure under other 
operating systems.
Kernel version: both 2.4.2 (standard and Mandrake) and 2.4.4 (standard)
Environment/OS: Linux Mandrake 8.0
Processor info: AMD Athlon 600 Mhz.
Chipset: VIA82C686A (UDMA 66)
Included with this e-mail is a dmesg trace and a copy of the /proc directory.
