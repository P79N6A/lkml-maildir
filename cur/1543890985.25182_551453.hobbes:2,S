Here are some more warnings I would like to see:
- Warning for any spinlock/mutex definition that doesn't have a comment
nearby (all locks ought to be documented) 
- Keep an ifdef count and give minus points for too many
- Warn about any architecture ifdefs (__i386__ etc.) 
While not 100% illegal this is definitely something that needs to be 
justified
