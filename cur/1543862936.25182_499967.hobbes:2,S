Well, since the definitions lived well in compiler-generic land for quite 
some time, I'd guess it should be ok not to #ifndef - guard them. 
likely() and unlikely() are currently handled like that.
If the need ever arises to make them compiler specific, whoever does that 
can still add the #ifndef then.
