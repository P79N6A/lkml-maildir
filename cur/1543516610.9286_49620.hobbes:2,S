  Can't you use some dummy char device with two ringbuffers, one to put syscalls 
into from the kernel (concerned process is then suspended), 
a daemon in userland to peek into that first buffer with read() and authorize 
them with write() to the second buffer, at which point the concerned process
will be resumed? This does not seem to cause any overhead as opposed to 
ptrace in both MP and SP...
