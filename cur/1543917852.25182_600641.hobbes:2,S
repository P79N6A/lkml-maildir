Thanks for responding to this.
No messages.
Behaved like it was randomly killing other processes?? It was actually still
swapping furiously when I reset the machine (at least the hard disk LED was 
blinking), this after some 10 minutes or so.
At that time the whole desktop had died, also some other processes.
I would also like it to kill the offending process, not others if it can
be avoided.
Is the behavior of the OOM killer configurable? I might have it wrong.
I now set the ulimit -v (max virtual memory) to 512MB in hope of this
protecting my system, but this might get me into trouble when using gimp etc.
Best
Dag
