Have a look at this piece of code.
The instructions prior to the execl() function is not getting executed.
When I give a getchar() after the printf statement then the "Tr -module" 
is getting printed.
From the manpage, what I had understood is that the execl function 
replaces the current process image with the new process image.
But, Does it replaces the prior instructions also? or what is happening??
 int pid;
 pid = fork();
 if (pid == 0)
 {
   printf("Tr -module");
   getchar();
   execl("/sbin/insmod", "insmod", "trc", NULL);
 }
 else if (pid < 0)
        perror("Error in fork - load2.c");
 else
 {
        printf("I am in the parent process");
    
 }
