No, they are read/write spinlocks and you are not allowed to sleep
in their critical section In general you should limit them
because they can get very costly, e.g. when you're taking interrupts
with one taken or doing something else which takes a long time
and another CPU has to spin for them. 
rw semaphores are down_read()/down_write() etc.
