On my system, /usr/src/linux IS a SymLink, and the above works fine.

What on earth for!!! It doesn't even begin to match the original
command and its aims.

Note also that the sequence 'fuck' is a valid compression sequence
that could easily be generated by gzip when it compresses the code.
Your command will quite happily report it as well...
