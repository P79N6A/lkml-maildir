Hi,
Since 2.4.21-ac2 i'm experiencing problems with Postfix on Debian 
Stable. Messages get corrupted while being handled by Postfix.
Vanilla 2.4.21 and 2.4.21-ac1 are fine, but 2.4.21-ac2/3 causes 
problems. Going back to ac1 resolves the issue. I tried kernels on 
several Debian servers, but all have the same problem. Could be it's 
something in postfix that emerges with this specific patch, but it's at 
least curious. I'm not too familiar with this matter unfortunately.
The only logentries i see are:
postfix/qmgr[399]: warning: active/0/4/04E5B17E3F: too many length bits, 
record type 255
postfix/qmgr[399]: warning: 04E5B17E3F: envelope records out of order
postfix/qmgr[399]: warning: saving corrupt file "04E5B17E3F" from queue 
"active" to queue "corrupt"
...or just...
postfix/smtp[536]: warning: corrupted queue file: active/C/7/C7AC317E3F
Tested on: Intel PPro, Intel Celeron, AMD Duron
Tested on: ext2 and ext3
All other programms seem to work fine, no other strange messages 
whatsoever...
