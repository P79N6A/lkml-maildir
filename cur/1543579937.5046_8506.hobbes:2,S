On 2.4.0-ac12, I played music for about 30 minutes without any problems.  I started up an mpeg in xmms and it
locked in short order.  I'm sure now that it has something to do with the graphics.  What DGA or other config
options do you have enabled for your game?
What video and sound card?
I have an ATI Rage LT Pro AGP-133 according to lspci.
