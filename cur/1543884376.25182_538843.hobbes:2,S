Yes, it's been a while since the last submission for review [1], and
most of the changes went over linux1394-devel only.  And to put it
mildly, there aren't a lot of capable reviewers watching that list.
Changes since last submission, AFAIR:
  - completion of the DMA engine
  - completion of the userspace ABI
  - extensions to exported sysfs attributes
  - some other feature additions like bus manager capability
  - lots of bug fixes
  - some style fixes
I'll folllow up with "git diff v2.6.21-rc3..juju" ripped apart,
reordered, and refreshed against 2.6.21:
[PATCH 1/6] firewire: handling of cards, buses, nodes
[PATCH 2/6] firewire: isochronous and asynchronous I/O
[PATCH 3/6] firewire: char device interface
[PATCH 4/6] firewire: OHCI-1394 lowlevel driver
[PATCH 5/6] firewire: SBP-2 highlevel driver
[PATCH 6/6] firewire: add it all to kbuild
(If this division seems odd, don't blame Kristian, blame me. :-)
I'm looking forward to comments.
