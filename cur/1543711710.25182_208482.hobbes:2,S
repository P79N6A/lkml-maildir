me too, that's why I deleted mm/rmap.c and I use objrmap.c instead. rmap
has always been used for years to mean your current implementation
of pte based reverse mappings in 2.6-mainline and 2.4-rmap, that's
blatantly too obvious to even make further jokes about that. If you now
me to believe that that is not true and that every single time you said
"rmap" it was a strict english abbreviation for the generic word
"reverse mappings" without any remote relation to the current
2.6-mainline and 2.4-rmap implementation of the reverse mapping methods,
then maybe you want to write some PR don't waste your time trying to
convince me.
