I agree this occurred.  I'm not ignoring the evidence, you are ignoring 
the part you didn't quote -- the key component of the "users don't test" 
problem.
A user who doesn't follow LKML does not know that Linus put his foot 
down in 2.6.11-rc3.  or 2.6.10-rc2.  or 2.6.9-rc1.  A user just sees "at 
some random point, which is never consistent, it becomes bugfixes only."
The lack of consistency is the problem.  That is why posters in this 
thread keep suggesting a -pre/-rc split.  That is why posters in this 
thread talk about "users don't trust -rc to mean -rc."
Marcelo consistently says "-rc means serious bugfixes only" and never 
deviates from that.  And that builds users TRUST.
"putting down your foot" is only half the solution.
The other half is, "users need not follow LKML to know when this occurs."
