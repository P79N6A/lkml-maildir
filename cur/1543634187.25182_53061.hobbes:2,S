Sure. Execute `swapoff -a`, followed by `swapon -a`. This is no joke.
What didn't get 'pushed' back to RAM is the data from sleeping tasks
that may never wake up for days or years like the daemons that are
awaiting network connections that never happen, or getties that never
get to log-in. So, their data stays on the swap device(s) and their
RAM is freed for use. If you insist in putting this data back into
RAM, thereby wasting RAM, you can do as shown.
