Well, I have two Ultra TX/2 100's in my dual P3 800, and that's
worked fine since I set it up.  Interestingly, it seems that the
first board's BIOS detects the second board and does autodetection
for all drives on both boards, and then the second board's BIOS
doesn't get run at all.  
Whatever, it works...  I did have to add the /dev/hdi and /dev/hdk 
device nodes to my (mostly) Mandrake 8.0 system though.
There are four Maxtor drives on the two Promise adaptors, working 
nicely as a raid 5 array, formatted as a single huge reiserfs.
Only one weird thing:  When I mount the reiserfs partition on
the raid, I get the following messages:
raid5: switching cache buffer size, 4096 --> 1024
raid5: switching cache buffer size, 1024 --> 4096
hmmm.
