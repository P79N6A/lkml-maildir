Drop the vendor check; PAT is a generic x86 feature.  If AMD is not 
compatible (see below), then use X86_VENDOR_AMD: and default:.

It would apply to both; the chipset wouldn't even know how it got invoked.

Bad move.  Some (Intel) processors drop the top bit, so it's much better 
to pick the protection methods one cares about (usually WB, WC, UC) and 
stick them in the first four, then duplicate the whole thing in the 
second half.
Unless you actually expect someone to use WT or WP, no need to tickle 
this particular bug.

If one sets the PAT to "uncached", does one get the same function as 
"uncachable"?
