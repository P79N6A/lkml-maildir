If you remove a drive and then add it back with
no changes in the meantime, then you don't want
a resync to happen.  Some people reboot their machine
every day (too much noise, heat or electricity at night),
a daily resync is excessive.
An which drive would you consider
the "master copy" anyway, if the event counts match?
