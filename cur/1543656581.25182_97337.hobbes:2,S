The "default owner" is someone to dispostion the bug ... not necessarily
to fix it.

Anything in "OPEN" state isn't really assigned to anyone yet.
(the state would really better be named "NEW", but it's not). 
People should move it to "ASSIGNED" if they're working on it.

Go to file a new bug, click on the link by the subcategories, and it'll
tell you (you'll have to pick the main category first).

Not sure the best way to work this to be honest ... it may work better
as a pull system ... pick something that looks interesting and grab it.
You won't have permission to just change the owner field, but you can
add comments to bugs, and / or email the owner in question.
There are a bunch of categories that aren't really "owned" as such,
and default to khoa or myself. Those are really good candidates to
steal ... they'll be owned by bugme-janitors soon to make this more
obvious ...
