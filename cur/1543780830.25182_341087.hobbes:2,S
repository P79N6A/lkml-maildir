No objection really, but I recently reformatted the m68k sys_ptrace() so 
it would be easier to regenerate your changes on top of this. I can do 
this for you if we can agree on to merge at least the m68k ptrace changes 
before this.
For reference I put the patches at www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/m68k_merge/
(tf, p_ws, p_c are the relevant patches).
Al, this also includes the updated thread_info patches, I fixed some of 
m68k specific parts. Could you please expand a little on the objections 
you made on IRC?
bye, Roman
