Subject: 2.5.64: menuconfig: help within choice blocks doesn't show?

I've noticed the help text for menuconfig options doesn't show if it's inside
a Kconfig choice block.  For example under "Processor type and features" ->
"Processor family" none of the help shows for the processor types even
though the help texts are present in the Kconfig file.
Is anybody else seeing this?
