yeah: real-time tasks are ueber-tasks that just get all CPU time 
immediately. I guess we could make SCHED_RR be covered by CFS accounting 
eventually.

note: you ran it on a dual-core system and the SMP load-balancer needs 
time to gain precision in the non-RT test - so i'd suggest to test it 
much longer than 10 seconds: 300 seconds at least.
