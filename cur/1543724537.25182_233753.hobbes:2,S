Just wanted to add my 0.02euro - To me it sounds like a good idea to have
a testsuite with "must pass these" tests that official kernel releases get
tested against.. maybe just the final -rc's before a new stable release.
What should be in the test suite and how it should be
maintained/updated will of course be a matter of debate, but
the basic idea that if release candidates doesn't pass the basic test
suite, then another release candidate must surface sounds very sane to me.
