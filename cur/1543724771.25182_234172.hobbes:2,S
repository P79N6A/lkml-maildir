3 is feature. It prints warning, but lets you mount it. I sometimes mount
broken fs's rw; it actually saved me once when I was hitting fsck bug.
It is also handy when quickly recovering scratch machine.
MS-DOS had no fsck... and survive. ext2 can survive with similar results
if you just dont fsck...

I actually liked your report ;-).
