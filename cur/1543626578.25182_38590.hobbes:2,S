When I power off a system running bootable software RAID mirroring the
raid array is unclean when the system boots back up.
Neil Brown pointed out that the problem may be related to APM shutting
the computer off before everybody (md driver and/or ide and/or drives)
are ready.
Compiling the kernel without APM/ACPI support certainly solves the
problem.
I'm running Linux 2.4.18 on this system.  Has this problem been
addressed in any later versions?
Or shall I start exploring the APM, ide driver, md driver, ide
drive interactions?
