Hmmm. I'm not quite understanding. Does reverting just
time-fix-cpu-frequency-detection.patch change anything? I just sent out
a fix for an error case that patch, but I doubt you'd be hitting it.
Looking at the log here:
http://oioio.altervista.org/linux/boot-2.6.15-mm2.3
I'm curious if you're getting cpufreq effects during interval while the
TSC is being used as a clocksource before we switch to using the acpi_pm
clocksource.
After the system boots up, does it keep accurate time? Time doesn't
obviously move too fast or to slow compared to a watch?
Few things to try (independently):
1. Does booting w/ idle=poll change the behavior?
2. Does booting w/ clocksource=jiffies change the behavior?
3. After booting up, run: 
   echo tsc > /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource
   And check that the system keeps accurate time.
Thanks for the great testing and feedback!
