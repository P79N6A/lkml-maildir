Do you think it's worth the time to patch the current
version? Will Linus apply the patch so we will hopefully
have a 2.6.x kernel that compiles (at least) on alpha's?
Is there anybody who is willing to test such a patch
on different alpha's (I only have some XLT's, an AS800
and one AS250, so all alcor based systems with
ISA and PCI but without EISA and all are using sys_alcor.c)?
Further I can't test SMP with this _very_ old hardware.
