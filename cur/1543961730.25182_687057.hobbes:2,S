Thats interesting, some of these patches should actually be credited to 
Carsten - and in fact on kvm.git master they are credited to Carsten.
I think the problem is, that these patches contained multiple From lines. On 
kvm.git the first line (Carsten) was used. When you transferred these patches 
to the kvm.git-2.6.26-branch, git used the next From-line as the original one 
was already removed.
While it is not a typical case, is there a better way of specifying multiple 
authors to avoid future confusion?
