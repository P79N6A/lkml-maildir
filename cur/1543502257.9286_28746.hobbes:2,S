You might look into using my user-mode kernel.  Since it's a set of processes, 
you can compile it -pg like any other process.  I'm not sure how its 
multi-threadedness would affect its profilability.
I'm currently updating it to 2.3.8, and I'll bring it current with the latest 
development kernel when I get it working with 2.3.8.
In the meantime, you can look at what's available now at
