Okay, I added a patch to make the sequence increments atomic. Now
i_size_write() still sometimes ends up with an odd sequence, but
i_size_read() doesn't lock up anymore.
What lock exactly is supposed to protect i_size_write, since it
appears that i_size_write is being called without proper locking ?
(Am I right?)
