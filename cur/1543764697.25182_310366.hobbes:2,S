I think you at least instinctively know this, but...
Centralized SCM means you have to grant and revoke commit access,
which means that Linux gets the disease of ugly BSD politics.
Under both the old pre-BitKeeper patch system and under BitKeeper,
developer rank is fuzzy. Everyone knows that some developers are
more central than others, but it isn't fully public and well-defined.
You can change things day by day without having to demote anyone.
While Linux development isn't completely without jealousy and pride,
few have stormed off (mostly IDE developers AFAIK) and none have
forked things as severely as OpenBSD and DragonflyBSD.
You may rank developer X higher than developer Y, but they have
only a guess as to how things are. Perhaps developer X would be
a prideful jerk if he knew. Perhaps developer Y would quit in
resentment if he knew.
Whatever you do, please avoid the BSD-style politics.
