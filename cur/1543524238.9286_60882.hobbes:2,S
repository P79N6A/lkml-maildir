No. It is (according to current standard) misuse of dep_bool.
Look in my postings to l-k with subj: "2.3.41 config: suggested [PATCH]"
Simple changing that in one place may brake some others.
Maybe it is good reasom for creating a new config function ?
How to name it ?
    dep_bool_mod ?
    dep_bool_nomod ?
Regards
