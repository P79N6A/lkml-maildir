This argument was made and lost as you say. The problem is that the
resolution was a decision from on high. For the most part, everyone
kept their original opinion and nothing was truly resolved. I think
there was some resentment on the part of the losing side because
they felt their opinions weren't seriously considered. Please
correct me if my impressions of that were wrong. I was not directly
involved in such arguments at the time.
