   I've always favoured IBM disks in all my hardware, from enterprise external 
scsi raid hardware to small ide hardware raid devices (3ware fyi). At home all 
my four disks are IBM (two DTLA). But with your information it seems i have 
been bitten by that problem twice at the same time. Several months ago a less 
zealous system administrator, while shutting down a couple servers for 
maintenance at night, made a mistake in the console kvm switch, and pushed 
the red button on a live server with four DTLA IBM disks plugged to a 3ware 
raid card. On recovery, and after some time, one of the volumes started 
complaining about errors, and went into degraded mode. One of the disks was 
clearly broken we thought. So we exchanged it, but alas a couple hours later 
another one in another volume complained. We also exchanged that one and 
rebuilt everything. After checking the disks with IBM drive fitness software both 
presented bad blocks that were recovered with a low level format. I dismissed 
the events as something weird, but with some logical explanation beyond my 
grasp. Now all makes sense.
