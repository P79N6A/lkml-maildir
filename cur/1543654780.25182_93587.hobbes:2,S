Correcting my previous post ...
On reviewing drivers/block/scsi_ioctl.c it supports both
the SG_IO (i.e. equivalent to the sg driver's SG_IO ioctl)
and the SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl with the old
functionality. So the SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl is
consistent for both block and char (scsi) drivers.
The SG_IO ioctl first appeared in the lk 2.4 series
(2.4.0) while the SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl has
been there for a long time (but has been marked as
deprecated in the source for some time).
