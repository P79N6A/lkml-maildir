If you say so. I'd call it pure pragmatism: if the sysfs interface
still changes every other week or so, it's just annoying to chase these
changes in applications, so it seems just practical to wait until all
the bug fixes that require interface changes are in and the rate of
incompatible changes is well below 2/year -- and all the interesting
stuff is there.
