Why do we even want to do reverse page tables?
It seems everyone is assuming this is a good thing and except for being
a touch more flexible I don't see what this buys us (besides more locked memory).
My impression with the MM stuff is that everyone except linux is
trying hard to clone BSD instead of thinking through the issues
ourselves.
And because of the extra overhead this doesn't look to be a win on a
heavily loaded box with no swap.  And probably only glibc mmaped.
