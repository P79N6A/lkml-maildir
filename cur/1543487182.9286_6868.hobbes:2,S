Strange enough, it works here without any tricks.
MBR (unchanged) loads OS2BootMan loads LILO(20) loads NT. Of course I can
also load NT from OS2BootMan.
Config: /dev/hda3 MS-DOS  FAT  (C:)
        /dev/hda8 WinNT   FAT  (F:)
        /dev/hda5 Linux / ext2
Booting of NT goes via the boot secotr of C: and I got a selection to boot
either DOS or NT from NT's bootloader.
I believe you just need a MSDOS FAT Partition to make your LILO load NT ...
