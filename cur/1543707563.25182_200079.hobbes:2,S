Hello Ingo,
Can you help? I've tried reaching bugzilla.redhat.com, but didn't
connect.
We have a problem with a IO-APIC + timer on a RedHat Linux 2.4.21
kernel:
    ESR value after enabling vector: 00000000
    Calibrating delay loop... 6107.95 BogoMIPS
    CPU: Trace cache: 12K uops, L1 D cache: 8K
    CPU: L2 cache: 512K
    CPU: Hyper-Threading is disabled
    Intel machine check reporting enabled on CPU#1.
    CPU1: Intel(R) Xeon(TM) CPU 3.06GHz stepping 09
    Total of 2 processors activated (6945.17 BogoMIPS).
    ENABLING IO-APIC IRQs
    Setting 7 in the phys_id_present_map
    ...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 7 ... ok.
    Setting 8 in the phys_id_present_map
    ...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 8 ... ok.
    Setting 9 in the phys_id_present_map
    ...changing IO-APIC physical APIC ID to 9 ... ok.
    ..TIMER: vector=0x31 pin1=2 pin2=0
    ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
    ...trying to set up timer (IRQ0) through the 8259A ...
    ..... (found pin 0) ... failed.
    timer doesn't work through the IO-APIC - disabling NMI Watchdog!
    ...trying to set up timer as Virtual Wire IRQ... failed.
    ...trying to set up timer as ExtINT IRQ... failed :(.
    Kernel panic: IO-APIC + timer doesn't work! pester mingo@redhat.com
    In idle task - not syncing
 
The hardware is
 
    Northbridge:    Intel E7505 Chipset, Plumas
    Southbridge:    Intel ICH3S
    Super-I/O:              NS PC87366/VLA
    FWH:                    SST 49LF004A
    Giga-LAN:               Intel 82546EB
    SCSI:                   Adaptec 7902
    Processors:             2 X Prestonia processors, 533 MHz FSB, 2.8
GHz -
    3.2 GHz
    Memory:         1 - 6 registered DIMMs, PC2100R, DDR 266

Thanks in advance,
