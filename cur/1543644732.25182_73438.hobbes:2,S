I see two problems with this - first is that strings are not and can not
be assumed to be on nice word boundaries.  While x86 and some (many)
CPUs can actually read words (longs/etc) at non-natural boundaries,
they suffer in performance.  Other architectures can not even do the
reads and will cause a trap/exception that *may* be handled in software.
(Or may not)
Second, unless you know for sure how long the string buffer is you can
not easily bound down the string in larger chunks.  (It may hurt
reading that byte just beyond the end of the string since it is on
another page, etc)
There is also the added overhead of noticing the '\0' byte at the
end of the string since it may be in the middle of your 32-bit
64-bit) data value.
Given all of this, it is rather unlikely that for strings it is worth
doing anything different than the (usually) highly tuned assembly of
the strcmp() code.
(memcpy() has, by its nature and API at least the size which can
significantly help, along with architecture knowledge that it can
then use to pick the right)
A side note:  While memcmp() could use the same logic of memcpy(),
the greater/less than result code specifically is documented at
byte level.  This was a real PITA for Alpha CPUs to make fast,
especially the earlier ones that did not even have natural byte
operators.  (Alpha was designed with UNICODE characters in mind
and performance as its top concern.)
