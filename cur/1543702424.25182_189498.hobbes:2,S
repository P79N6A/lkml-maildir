Hi Dominik
Are you using under X or console?
I can confirm that MX600 logitech cordless USB works
under  2.6.0 RH 9, I do not have the exact details on config
file here. From memory I have
CONFIG_INPUT_MOUSE=y
CONFIG_MOUSE_PS2=y
and set XFree86Config

# Identifier and driver
                                                                                                                                                             
    Identifier  "Mouse1"
    Driver      "mouse"
    Option "Protocol"    "ImPS/2"
    Option "Device"      "/dev/psaux"
    Option "ZaxisMapping" "4 5"
I also attach the mouse via one of those usb=>ps2 adapter things
supplied by logitech.
