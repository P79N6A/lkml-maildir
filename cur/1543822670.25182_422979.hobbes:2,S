We could turn of this kind of warnings that generate these kind of false 
positives globally with -Wno-uninitialized until a future gcc version 
might be better at avoiding false positives.
But there's one problem, this turns off two kinds of warnings:
- 'foo' may be used uninitialized in this function
- 'foo' is used uninitialized in this function
The first kind of warnings is the one generating the false positives 
while the second kind are warnings we do not want to lose, but AFAIK 
there's no way to only turn off the first kind.
Perhaps asking the gcc developers for separate options for these two 
kinds of warnings in gcc 4.2 and then turning off the first kind is 
the way to go?
