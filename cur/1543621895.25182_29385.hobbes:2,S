At least the rule base change from imperative -> inferential seems to
necessarily entail a single very large atomic change, given the arch-wide
rules present in the rulebase. This is the heart of the thing, and
ignoring for a moment Alan's claim that it's unnecessary, it's not at all
obvious that there's an incremental approach here. Any hints?
Hanging off the translation are things like the interpreter for the new
language bringing it up to parity with the old interpreter, which is a
meaningless delta by itself, but without which the core change is useless.
The orthogonal changes are relatively minor.
