Can Chris or someone please tell me what is the reason behind leaving
__kernel_uid_t == short on x86 architecture, and adding
__kernel_uid32_t?  To me, it sounds more reasonable to rather make
__kernel_uid_t == int and add __kernel_uid16_t == short for binary
compatibility things.
As a result of current status of things, 32bit uid support does *not*
become visible to the userspace when you rebuild glibc with the new
kernel source.  To make it take effect, you also need to modify glibc
source, and in a rather illogical way.
Am I missing something?
Eugene
