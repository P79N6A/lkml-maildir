Wow. I wish this had been around 9 months ago.. There were a couple of minor
things that I wasn't sure about -- but that's more likely to be because /I've/
got the wrong end of the stick. I'll check the kernel source and get back to
you if it turns out I'm right..
Linking to it from the lkml FAQ and the front page of kernelnotes.org is
probably a good idea.
