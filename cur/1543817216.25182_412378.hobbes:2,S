You applied the wrong patch.  The inlined one was against virgin 2.6.16,
for folks to comment on, and the attached was the incremental against
the 2.6.16 anti-starvation tree.
Ah, your mailer probably showed both as attached.  Anyway, here's the
incremental again inlined.
(note to self:  never include patches for two trees in same message)
