That's correct, there is this controller, used by Asus for their EZ-Backup
feature. But I'm not using it, there is no disk connected on the associated
ports, and it's disabled in the BIOS.

No real preferences... except for a working machine, which is not what
I have for now...
I've been trying this, but I ended with the ICH7 not detecting anymore
my IDE disks... 
Should try again, maybe I missed something.
