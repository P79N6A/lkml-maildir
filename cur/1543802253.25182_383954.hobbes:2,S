The thing about this is that you can't (if the kernel is not buggy)
deadlock on the kernel spin locks.  As long as you protect the locks in
the futex from deadlocking you are fine.  This is because you don't grab
a futex after grabbing a kernel spin lock.  All kernel spin locks
__must__ be released before going back to user land, and that's where
you grab the futexes.
