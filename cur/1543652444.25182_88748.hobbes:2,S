	Guys, may I remind you that Oct 31 had been more than a week ago?
Devfs *is* a race-ridden pile of crap, but we are in a goddamn feature
freeze, so let's get real.
	Interfaces can and should be cleaned up.  Ditto for semantics of
registering/unregistering - that allows to make glue in drivers more
straightforward.  Majestic flamewars about removing the thing completely/
moving it to userland/etc. are exercises in masturbation by that point.
	Again, WE ARE IN FEATURE FREEZE.
	Now, does somebody have technical comments on the proposed changes?
