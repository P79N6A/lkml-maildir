That's all fine and good, if the hardware design is entirely either
stuff designed to open specs (for instance, the actual PCI interface
chips, which *have* to behave a given way for the PCI bus to work) or
your own design.
Things get much more difficult if your hardware design ends up incorporating
somebody else's intellectual property, and they insist on such obfuscation
as part of the licensing terms.  You then have two choices:
1) Refuse to build and sell the board under such onerous requirements.
2) Realize that 95% of the computers that could possibly use your board
are running Windows and don't care about an open-source driver *anyhow*,
accept the fact that you'll not be able to sell to that last 5%, and
build it anyhow...
Only one of these choices generates revenue for your company.
