These are all good ideas.  Here we go again:
This patch implements per-arch scheduler support with specific support
(currently) for per-arch load balancing.  We implement an
asm-generic/sched.h with default methods.  Each architecture needs to
define its own asm/sched.h but by default it would just include
asm-generic/sched.h.
Better?
