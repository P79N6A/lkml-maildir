                                                               ^^^^^^ culprit !
Send me the raw PNP resource data so I can look into this:
1) Search for the right two-digit PNP handle for device "0104d041":
   cat /proc/bus/pnb/devices
   01      0104d041        07:01:00        0080
   02      0105d041        07:00:02        0180
   03      1005d041        07:00:02        0180
   04      0007d041        01:02:00        0003
   ...
   The number in the first column (here: 01) is the handle
   to be used in step 2.
2) Send cat /proc/bus/pnp/01 | od -tx1
