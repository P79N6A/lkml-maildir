It'd be interesting to add in some read-only operations (e.g., tar to
/dev/null) because, in general, filesystems trade off expensive writes
vs expensive reads.  Especially as the disk gets fuller. (What I mean
is that filesystems that do more work to optimise disk layout will be slower to
write, but should be faster to read.  And `easy' optimisations for
disk layout get harder as the disk gets fuller and fragmented).
So the other thing that'd be interesting to test is doing the same
thing after having pre-fragmented the disk in some predictable way.
