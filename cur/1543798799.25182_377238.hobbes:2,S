Thanks for doing this work.
Unfortunately we shouldn't be merging nontrivial patches from new
contributors with names like "Robert the Patch Devil" ;)
Please review Section 11 of Documentation/SubmittingPatches.txt and, if you
find the terms there to be acceptable, resend the patch with a
Signed-off-by: and your real name, thanks.
