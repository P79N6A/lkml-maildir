No.
I've tested this. It doesn't matter whether you do &secret+3 or
&secret[3]. Do you mean the compiler would treat first one as
integer-add, while second is pointer one, so result is += 3*sizeof(int) ?
I've made the changes you requested (and hopefully, i havent done sth. wrong :)
and here is the tcpdump-log:

As you see, the spoof was successfull.
If my calculater is OK, then the diff is 2011 which is still exploitable,
and i still was able to spoof rlogind here. (lucifer spoofs to be alice, liane
is running rlogind). The problem lies really in the MD4-algo!?

P.S.: The advisory was already posted to BUGTRAQ, but they didn't answered yet. :-(
      Should i resent it?
