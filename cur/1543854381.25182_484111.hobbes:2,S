It's Linux Texas Instruments OMAP processors tree, hosted at following links:
http://source.mvista.com/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux-omap-2.6.git;a=log
OR mirror copy is also available to view at
http://www.kernel.org/git/
You have not seen those drivers, because we have _not_ yet submitted
ALSA drivers for aic23 and ts2102 to upstream.
Pavel,  better submit those -omap tree based changes to dedicated
linux-omap-open-source mailing list instead. Please visit
http://linux.omap.com
 Thanx.
