   No. You really miss the point. That _still_ makes the program depend
   differently on which kernel happens to be on which machine. Which is so
   obviously wrong that I don't understand how anybody can accept it.
Linus,
	I'm talking about kernel modules.  Like the external PCMCIA
package; remember?  The one which you recommended distro's should use
because the 2.4 PCMCIA code wasn't quite up to snuff yet.
	Kernel modules *inherently* depends on which kernel happens to
be running on which machine.  We can't change that, because we don't
want to lock down kernel interfaces.
	It would be nice, however, if there was a painless way to
compile such external kernel modules so they easily work with whatever
kernels happens to be on the machine.  
	I accept your arguments that user-mode programs shouldn't depend
on the kernel which you happen to be compiling on.  But this simply
doesn't work for kernel modules.
