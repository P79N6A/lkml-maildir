Cause the fall through in do_mmap (around mm/mmap.c:223) all kind of
file mmap are denied with EACCES if file is not open for reading.
This is contrary to mmap(2):
ERRORS
...
       EACCES MAP_PRIVATE was asked, but fd is not open for read-
              ing.   Or  MAP_SHARED  was  asked and PROT_WRITE is
              set, fd is not open for writing.
As I'm unable to understand why a file opened WR_ONLY cannot be mmap'ed
PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED I deduce that a break is missing at line 222.
Another for me incomprehensible option is that mmap(2) is wrong... can
someone
clarify this?
