Yes.

I would agree.

Luis, could you please look into removing this message from the sources. It 
causes my kernel ring buffer to be wiped fairly quickly, which is annoying 
for debugging development kernels.
[OT] Thanks for the reply Russell. Any chance you could look over the BIOS 
workaround on bugzilla while we're discussing PCMCIA? I put a patch on there 
that's probably a load of nonsense, and we still haven't got your opinion on 
the matter..
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1840
It affects very few people, but it's a safe enough workaround as I'm using it 
successfully as I write this.
