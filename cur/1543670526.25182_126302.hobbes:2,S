I am not subscribed to this list - please include me on the 
'cc' line.
Version: 2.4.21-pre6
Subsystem: USB
Driver: Lego USB Tower
Writing one-short interrupt out transfers without this patch 
cause the system to hang. Applying this patch fixes that 
(thankfully after fsck'ing my disk a dozen times!) - however 
the driver (which works still using usb-ohci on an ohci 
card) - doesn't work because the reads are  failing - 
returning a ETIMEDOUT.
I am assuming that the changes made (see below) - somehow 
have affected other aspects of one-shot interrupt in transfers?
Thanks
David

A recent change (2.4.21) in the usb-uhci driver calls
"uhci_clean_iso_step2" after the completion of one-shot 
(urb->interval
0) interrupt out transfers. This call clears the list of 
descriptors.
However, it crashes when trying to get the next desciptor in 
the "for"
loop in the "process_interrupt" function, since the list of 
descriptors
are already cleared. A simple change I did was to do a 
"break" to quit
the "for" loop for interrupt out transfers with urb->interval 0.
Thanks,
Frode
