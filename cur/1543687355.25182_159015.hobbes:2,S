Hi all,
If the current code with Linux kernel 2.4.18 will also pick up the first one
address it finds ?
Assume that I have 2 IPv6 addresses (3ffe:3600:1b::1999, 3ffe:3600:1c:2999)
on eth0
I tried it on my RedHat 8.0, it always choose the same ipv6 address
(3ffe:3600:1b::1999) to internet,
but when I check the soure code, it shows as below
/*
 * Choose an apropriate source address
 * should do:
 * i) get an address with an apropriate scope
 * ii) see if there is a specific route for the destination and use
 *  an address of the attached interface
 * iii) don't use deprecated addresses
 */
int ipv6_get_saddr(struct dst_entry *dst,
     struct in6_addr *daddr, struct in6_addr *saddr)
Why this does not work ? or when it will work ?
Suggestion is needed. Thanks.
Regards,
PC
