Removing 32-bit NUMA is attractive - NUMAQ we can probably live without,
not sure about summit.  But superh is starting to use NUMA now, due to
varying access times of various sorts of memory, and one can envisage other
embedded setups doing that.
Plus I don't think there are many flags left in the upper 32-bits.  ia64
swooped in and gobbled lots of them, although it's not immediately clear
how many were consumed.

That's cringeworthy too, I expect.
