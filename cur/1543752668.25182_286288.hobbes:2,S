Looks fine.  Maybe you can add the following section?
  3) Non-disclosure agreements
  The Linux kernel security contact is not a formal body and therefore
  unable to enter any non-disclosure agreements.
UNIRAS and probably others require NDAs from affected software vendors
before they share vulnerability information.  It makes things easier
if you state upfront that you won't play such games.
