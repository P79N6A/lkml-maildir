This is true.

I.e. on hard irq? It was not a good idea.

This is really difficult case.

Though this one can be fixed by restricting affinity,
all this smells like you cannot use netif_rx() for such devices.
netif_rx() is used for normal "unreliable" devices, it loses any
sense as soon as we require some reliability...
