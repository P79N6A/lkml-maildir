your cpu_is_idle will return 0 in the need_resched != 0 check even if the cpu
is idle (because of the -1 trick for avoiding the SMP-IPI to notify the cpu).
The issue you are addressing is quite londstanding and it is not only related
to the loop with an idle cpu.
This is the way I prefer to fix it:
