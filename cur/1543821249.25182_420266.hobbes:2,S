Bill,

please, note, that connections are not dropped, new connections are not 
responded with RESET and when VM is migrated all the clients are 
serviced as if nothing has happened. From client point of view there is 
only a small delay in servicing, but not a real downtime (when clients 
are rejected). Maybe due to these some of people call it zero down-time. 
Though from technical POV this is not the best term for sure. It is 
better to call it checkpointing/restore or live migration.
