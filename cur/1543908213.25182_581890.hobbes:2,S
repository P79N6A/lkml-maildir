Subject: [PATCH] Minor fix to Documentation/powerpc/00-INDEX
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Signed-off-by: Rob Landley <rob@landley.net>
I have a python script to convert 00-INDEX files into index.html files, and a
second script to show 404 errors in the result as well as files/directories
nothing links to.   (It's not very useful yet, but in case you're wondering
http://kernel.org/doc/docdiridx.py
 and 
http://kernel.org/doc/doclinkcheck.py
.)
Anyway, my simple index.html generator breaks on the Documentation/powerpc
directory because one of the description lines is two lines long.  This
patch joins those two lines together into one line.  This is the only
instance (so far) of this problem.

In case you're wondering, here are the current the 404 errors in the
various 00-INDEX files.  Fixing all this is on my todo list:

The "files and directories not linked to" list is 679 lines long.
