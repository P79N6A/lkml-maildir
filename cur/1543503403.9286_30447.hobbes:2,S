Having trouble with networking lockups with this kernel. Intel eepro100.
Kernel is compiled UP. Everything else appears to work but interface locks
up seemingly at random, with or without any activity. ifconfig down/up the
interface seems to free it back up. Ethernet drivers are compiled in, not
modules. No errors logged anywhere.
I have not experianced this problem with 2.2.10 (linus' kernel). Happend
just now as I was finishing the above sentance.
