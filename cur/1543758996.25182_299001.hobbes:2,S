OK, rethinking about it, your arguments sound reasonable.
Could anyone explain, what exactly happens if multiple "aes" algorithms 
are compiled into the kernel?
Choosing between the i386 asm and the generic versions seems easy, bug 
the VIA Padlock case sounds more tricky since it works only on a subset 
of the i386 architecture.
