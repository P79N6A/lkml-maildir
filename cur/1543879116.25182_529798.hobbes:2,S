Subject: [PATCH 0/8] AFS: Add security support and fix bugs
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/11/268

These patches build on the patchset labelled "AF_RXRPC socket family and AFS
rewrite".  The patches are also available for http download.
Firstly, the patches fix a number of bugs in AF_RXRPC:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/09-af_rxrpc-own-workqueues.diff
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/10-af_rxrpc-fixes.diff
Secondly, they fix some bugs in the AFS filesystem:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/11-afs-callback-wq.diff
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/12-afs-vlocation.diff
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/13-afs-multimount.diff
And finally, they add security support to AFS:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/14-afs-rxrpc-key.diff
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/15-afs-nameidata-key.diff
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/16-afs-security.diff
A security key is acquired by running the klog program:
	
http://people.redhat.com/~dhowells/rxrpc/klog.c
This is compiled by:
	make klog CFLAGS="-Wall -g" LDLIBS="-lcrypto -lcrypt -lkrb4 -lkeyutils"
And then run by:
	./klog
Note that at the moment this is a rough and ready test program that has the
username, realm, password and proposed key timeout compiled in.  Note also that
it will only talk to the AFS kaserver.
If a security key is acquired, then all subsequent operations - including VL
lookups and mounts - performed with that session keyring will be authenticated
using that key.  The key can be viewed like so:
	[root@andromeda ~]# keyctl show
	Session Keyring
	       -3 --alswrv      0     0  keyring: _ses.3268
		2 --alswrv      0     0   \_ keyring: _uid.0
	111416553 --als--v      0     0   \_ rxrpc: afs@CAMBRIDGE.REDHAT.COM
