Yes, you can.  It's an option in the BIOS SETUP screen during POST.

Yes.  (This is what I had done on my PE2400 for years too, before I
replaced it entirely).  The SCSI controller is then driven by aic7xxx,
80MB/sec capable, though in that unit it's only a single SCSI channel
and the backplane is a single 1x6 backplane, so you can't split the
bus in half; but that's no different than what you've already got.
Thanks,
Matt
