I think Shannon maintains that now.

yeah, it's a real trap.  For a while I had a patch which converted
kmap_atomic() to return a char*, and kunmap_atomic() to take a char*, so
misuse got compile warnings.  But it was a pig to maintain so I tossed it. 
It'd be somewhat easier to do now we've converted a lot of callers to
clear_user_highpage() and similar.
