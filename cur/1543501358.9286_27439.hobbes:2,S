well so far I have seen only a few things that come back every time. 
(I collected a lot e-mail regarding this)
o) egcs or gcc - it doesn't matter
o) ide or scsi - it doesn't matter
o) happens with high disk activities
o) 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 are affected
o) all overclocked systems are not accounted for (it's stupid anyway)
o)    
2.2.7 is running here with all possible diskio -- no failures
2.2.9 bingo, 2.2.10 bingo -- corrupted fs
anyways. we'll see some day you gods will find it ;-)
