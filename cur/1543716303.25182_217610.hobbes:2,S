So why do you think that is inconsistent with my statement: "the
permissions checking has to be done by the server, period"?
The read-only mount option is a *local* override of the write
permissions on the server. It applies to regular files, directories, and
soft links *only*.
The read-only mount option does *not apply* to char/block devices such
as /dev/hd[a-z]*, /dev/tty*. Permission checks on open() for those
devices are done on the server *only* via the ACCESS rpc call.
This should be entirely consistent with local file behaviour.
Particularly since the code to deal with the read-only mount option in
nfs_permission() was pretty much cut-n-pasted from vfs_permission().
Cheers,
