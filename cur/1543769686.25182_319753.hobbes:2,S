Well MAP_FIXED must either mmap the physical location I provided or
it must fail. Since it didn't fail, I figure that it did what I
told it to do. Now, that "FIXED" refers to a fixed offset. Geert is
correct when he says that it's probably just in cache. Now begs
the question... Why would a hardware buffer ever be cached? That's
why I think I found a bug. It certainly shouldn't be cached.
