	The question is not what is possible, but what is optimal.
	Yes, it is possible to write drivers for machines without
consistent memory that work with any DMA device, by using
dma_{map,sync}_single as you suggest, even if caching could be
disabled.  That is how drivers/scsi/53c700.c and
drivers/net/lasi_82596.c work today.
	The advantages of James's approach is that it will result in
these drivers having simpler source code and even smaller object code
on machines that do not have this problem.
	If were to try the approach of using pci_{map,sync}_single
always (i.e., just writing the code not to use alloc_consistent), that
would have a performance cost on machines where using consistent
memory for writing small amounts of data is cheaper than the cost of
the cache flushes that would otherwise be required.
