Ok, this is important to kow becase we merged a mod around that time
that changes the way we handle the updates to the file size i.e. the
fix for the NULL-files-on-crash problem:
http://git2.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=ba87ea699ebd9dd577bf055ebc4a98200e337542
and that means the size of the file is not updated to the incore
cached inode until after the data write is complete. The symptoms
being seen would match with a inode-not-being-written-after-last-
data-write-bug in this mod....
Cheers,
Dave.
