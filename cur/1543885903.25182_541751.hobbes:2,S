It is analogous with a sequence point for ia64.  But, as you mentioned, it 
is ia64 specific so your comment about "asm volatile" constructs not being 
reordered is always appropriate outside of ia64 specific code but may not 
apply to ia64 if we ever compiled with -mvolatile-asm-stop.  If we do not
compile with that option, the behavior is unspecified.  I don't think 
we'll be adding -mvolatile-asm-stop support any time soon so your warning 
certainly is appropriate for all code at this time.
