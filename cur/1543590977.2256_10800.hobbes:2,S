Hello,
I'm in the process of installing a bunch of disks on a server.
I've read the md documentation about RAID and it seems that
RAID5 software is not supported in 2.2 kernels. Is this correct
or something has been done with RAID5 to make it working on
the latest 2.2.19 ? And in this case, at which level of
functionality ?
Tnaks for your help.
Ciao,
	Riccardo.
