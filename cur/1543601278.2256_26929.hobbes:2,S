Ask yourself why libaio in glibc uses threads. When there's no async-io
hook you have no choice. Adding the hook is an advantage if you're going
to use it during production, much better than
rescheduling/creating/destroying various threads during production, but
if you only need to register the hook once per day you'd waste time all
the production time checking if somebody is registered in the hook.
So while the "Threads are for people who don't understand state
machines" argument works for the userspace fileservers, it really
doesn't apply to the rcu slow path where we don't want to hurt the
schedule fast path with an hook.
However the issue with keventd and the fact we can get away with a
single per-cpu counter increase in the scheduler fast path made us to
think it's cleaner to just spend such cycle for each schedule rather
than having yet another 8k per cpu wasted and longer taskslists (a
local cpu increase is cheaper than a conditional jump).
