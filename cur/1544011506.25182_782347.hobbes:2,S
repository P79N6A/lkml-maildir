OK, I'll have a closer look, sorry for side tracking the thread (even
though I'm going to continue to do so, hehe).

Exactly, and that is partly my point.
Whether the VFS is implementing readdir for a mount's top level or also
for deeper levels it still has the issue described by Barata Rao in
http://marc.info/?l=linux-fsdevel&m=118914402631822&w=2.
 But my
suggestion doesn't only relate to the readdir issue it implies managing
such things as whiteout persistence also, but outside of individual file
systems. So, yes, I'm a bit off topic but the patch series here is going
to need something like this somewhere to ultimately be useful and all
I'm saying is that somewhere probably shouldn't be within individual
file systems and, yes, not in the VFS.
Valerie Henson is planning to start a project (when she is done with
current commitments) along the lines of a lightweight stacking layer
with union support included in the file system. These continuing
individual efforts are a little disjoint so such a project could be an
ideal way to define what's needed, what the issues are and how it will
be done in one place. Hopefully everyone that is keen to see progress in
this area will want to be involved too, ;)
Sorry for the off-topic rant, I just can't resist sometimes.
