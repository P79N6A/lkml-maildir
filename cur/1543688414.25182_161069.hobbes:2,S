Which filesystem?
What sort of I/O system?
Please grab 
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/fsx-linux.c
and run
	./fsx-linux foo -s <physmem-in-bytes> foo
on that machine for 12 hours or so.  Where <physmem-in-bytes> is (say)
256000000 on a 256-MB machine.
If the machine has more than a couple of gigabytes you'll need to run
multiple instances, against different files.
Make sure that a decent amount of I/O is happening during the run.
