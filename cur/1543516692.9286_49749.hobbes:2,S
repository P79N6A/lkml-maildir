Hi there. 
I have run into a weirdness in the last few days...
After a few days uptime, I start getting processes stuck in Disk
wait:
root     11284  0.0  0.1  1112  444 ?        D    Nov18   0:38 /usr/bin/slocate -u -e /home/rahl1,/home/rahl2,/tmp,/var/tmp,/usr/tmp,/afs,/net,/proc
root     26193  0.0  0.3  1488  804 ?        D    Nov19   0:00 rdump -9uaf rahl /dev/nst0 /home/jelerak1
root     28565  0.0  0.1  1112  444 ?        D    Nov19   0:36 /usr/bin/slocate -u -e /home/rahl1,/home/rahl2,/tmp,/var/tmp,/usr/tmp,/afs,/net,/proc
looking at the WCHAN:
slocate.cron     11277 wait4
slocate          11284 wait_on_buffer
slocate.cron     28558 wait4
slocate          28565 down_failed
rdump            26193 wait_on_buffer
Also, after this has taken place, if I try and do a 'sync' it never
comes back. ;( 
This happened with 2.2.13, but not until it had been up several
weeks. I went to 2.2.14pre6, and it happened in a day or two. 
I will leave the machine in it's current state today and tonight, and
reboot into 2.2.14pre7 tomorrow (or pre8 if it's out. ;) 
Let me know if anyone wants more info, or would like me to do anything
to gather more info.
thanks,
kevin
