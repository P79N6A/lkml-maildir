Hi Ron,
If you think "one make per directory" is a Windows phenomenon,
perhaps you could point me to some large Unix projects whose Makefiles
*aren't* structured like that.
Because every such project I've ever seen is based on "one make per
directory".
Please leave off the gratuitous Microsoft bashing.  Do you know which
parts of the kbuild system Microsoft wrote?  I do.  It's the part with
the fewest reported bugs.
Meanwhile, on the substantive issue, everybody wants "make -j" to
work properly.  I've identified the bug.  If you would like to patch
it, please go for it.
Michael
