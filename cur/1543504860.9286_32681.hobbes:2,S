Likewise.  Failing systems:
* Dell Dimension series, Pentium II 300, 1.5GB / (includes /tmp), 128MB
  RAM, 252MB swap, kernel 2.2.5; system did not run out of disk space
  while running script
* Intel SMP prototype machine of unknown provenance (donated to CMU ECE
  some years ago; I inherited it as a test box); 2*Pentium Pro 200,
  128MB RAM, 1.5GB /, 252MB swap, kernel 2.2.5
Succeeding systems:
* close to 600 machines, including MIPS Ultrix 4.3, Solaris 2.5.1 and 
  2.6 SPARC, AIX 4.1.5 and 4.3.2, Linux 2.0.35, 2.0.36, and 2.2.7.
All machines are running the same software (CMU ECE customized
installations, with the shell in all cases being bash
2.02.1(1)-release).
NB:  the systems that fail all ran (they've been reinstalled since) Red
Hat 6:  one was stock, one had all of Red Hat's released fixes.  But
the 2.2.x machines in CMU LCS don't show this symptom.  The problem is
therefore likely to be related to either Red Hat's patched 2.2.5 kernel
or glibc 2.1.

    We are Linux. Resistance is an indication that you missed the point.
