I stand corrected, it is a real bug and I let it slip in from the
ali.com.tw folks.  I recant the point and error here is mine.
However, one should note this would only be found if a person was booting
an add-in card.  This is why it has masked its self for so long.  Now the
much harder issue trace is the following.  So I am impressed that you
caught this very tiny bug that would be big and messy later.  Tip of the
hat to you.
Noting that in the special case of who/what is allowed to have access to
"ide0/ide1" this is an onboard host and generally would have the results:
 hwif->index == hwif->channel
If and only if the host had rights and priviledges to "ide0/ide1", would
it be masked.
So as the previous offer still stands point to have peace again, I am
still waiting for a reply on are going to be able to work through the
inital bumps an bangs from the beginning.
Cheers,
