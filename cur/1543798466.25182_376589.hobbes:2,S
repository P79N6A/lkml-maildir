CVS users, OTOH...

import Geert's 2.4.12 m68k patch
and the same for drivers/macintosh part.
So who should I put as the author?  You or Geert (or whatever attributions
might have been in said big patch)?  Incidentally,  ADBREQ_RAW had leaked
into mainline (sans definition) in 2.3.45-pre2, which was Feb 13 2000, i.e.
more than 1.5 year before your commit, so there's quite a chunk of history
missing...
I'm serious, BTW - I certainly would have no problem preserving attribution,
but it simply hadn't been there.  CVS logs are only as good as the data
being put there by committers...
