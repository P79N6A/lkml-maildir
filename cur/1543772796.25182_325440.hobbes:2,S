If one could come up with a good name to group inputX under I think
it will be OK. We'd have XXX, mouse, joystick, event, ... as subclasses
and all class_devices will be on level below. OTOH input_devs are parents
for mice, joysticks etc so they might be on the higher level.

I actually detest this practice:
[dtor@core ~]$ ls /sys/class/
firmware     ieee1394       ieee1394_protocol  mem   pci_bus        sound  usb_host
graphics     ieee1394_host  input              misc  pcmcia_socket  tty    vc
i2c-adapter  ieee1394_node  input_dev          net   printer        usb
[dtor@core ~]$
dtor@anvil ~]$ ls /sys/class/
cpuid     i2c-adapter  ieee1394_host      input  msr      printer      sound  usb_host
firmware  i2c-dev      ieee1394_node      mem    net      scsi_device  tty    vc
graphics  ieee1394     ieee1394_protocol  misc   pci_bus  scsi_host    usb    video4linux
[dtor@anvil ~]$
Firewire has 4 classes on the uppper level, I2C, USB, SCSI and Input got
2 each. It would be much nicer IMHO if we merge them into trees of classes
with poarent class actually defining subsystem.

We could have parent class define agent/subsystem name for all its children.
