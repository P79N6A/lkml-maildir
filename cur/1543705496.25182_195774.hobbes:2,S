I think the original poster was referring to the cache on the device.
I.E.
mount disc
view contents
unmount disc
erase disc - but don't erase the CD-R drive's cache of the media
mount disc
view old contents of the media from the CD-R drive's cache
However, note that the disc was fast erased - according to the
cdrecord manual page, only the PMA, TOC, and pregap are erased.
Therefore, as long as these are cached by the device, user data could
theoretically still be read directly from the media.
John.
