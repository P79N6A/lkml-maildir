Yeah, Linus pointed this stuff out.  Sorry for my mistake.

I'm very glad to hear that.  Casting between __user and __kernel is one
of my main concerns about sparse giving a false sense of security.  Now
I can stop worrying.

I just mentioned this scenario in my mail to Linus...

Looks right. PATCH:

Rough estimate: 66% - 80% of time is cqual. I just did a quick
experiment that came out about 68%.  So it takes about 3-4x as long as
it takes to just build.
Best,
