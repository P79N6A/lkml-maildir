one consideration is that if you read it from the hw you can't actually
fix it up in quirks at all, so it might make a lot of sense to just also
store it in the pci device struct, it's a very logical thing esp since
the pci device/vendor ids are stored there too (and those you can also
read from the hw if you want ;)
