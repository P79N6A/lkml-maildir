hmm, ok, so discontig.c is in use which narrows things down. When 
build_node_maps() is called, I assumed that the start and end pfn passed 
in was for a valid page range. Was this a valid assumption? When I re-read 
the comment, it implies that memory holes could be within this range which 
would cause boot failures. If that is the case, the correct thing to do 
was to call add_active_range() in count_node_pages() instead of 
build_node_maps().
