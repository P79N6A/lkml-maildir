This is very cool.  I hope all the devices on my laptop get treated

Does this mean
   (a) extra power is consumed while the driver is loaded but no CD is
       playing?
   (b) when the module is auto-unloaded, the CD sound stops?
(a) could be made a bit better by turning the power off completely when
the input mixer levels are zeroed.
(b) seems reasonable but is unlike other sound drivers.  With the other
drivers, you open /dev/mixer which autoloads the module, set the mixer
values, close /dev/mixer, play your CD, and the module is auto-unloaded
within a minute or two.  CD sound usually continues.
It doesn't take a leap of imagination to imagine that the CD driver or
player software might be convinced to zero the CD mixer input level when
not in use, some day.
have a radiant day,
