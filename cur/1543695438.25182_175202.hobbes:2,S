It is misplaced.  If revision 1.26 of ec.c were otherwise sound, I would place
ec_device_init = 1 right before the call to acpi_install_gpe_handler in
acpi_ec_start.  Anywhere outside that if and between where _add removes the
handlers and _start installs them would work.  This would fix your crash, but
it's not the right fix.

I don't think early calls to schedule_work (via acpi_os_queue_for_execution) are
a problem.  The call to init_workqueues is just before do_initcalls in
do_basic_setup, so it happens earlier than all this stuff.
The more general problem is that acpi_ec_gpe_query cannot run in an interrupt
handler as written.  It used to always run from a queue.  We can either fix it
so it can run from an interrupt handler or change it back to never doing so.  I
favor the latter, especially because I don't see how the recent change fixed the
problem T40 users were experiencing.

That particular placement looks racy.  I would do it after removing the
handlers, as explained above.
Thanks,
