This was the answer I was hoping for!  I'll try to get time to test and
improve myself ofcourse.
As for optimization: I take and release the current->pi_lock and
owner->pi_lock a lot because it isn't allowed to have both locks. Some
code restructuring could probably improve it such that it first finishes
what it has to finish under current->pi_lock then does what it has to do
under the owner->pi_lock - or the other way around.
In a few places pi_lock is taken without just to be sure. It might be
removed.
But first we have to establish the principle. Then optimization can begin.
