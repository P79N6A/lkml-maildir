hmm..
cpu0:
do_IRQ();
handle_IRQ_event();
...
static ide_startstop_t read_intr (ide_drive_t *drive)
{
	msect = drive->mult_count; /* let msect = 0 */
...
	
	if (i > 0) {
		if (msect)
			goto read_next;
		if (HWGROUP(drive)->handler != NULL) <- [1]
			BUG();
		ide_set_handler(drive, &read_intr, WAIT_CMD, NULL); <- [2]
                return ide_started;
	}
}
cpu1:
swsusp code;
...
	spin_lock_irqsave(&ide_lock, flags);
	while (HWGROUP(drive)->handler) {
		HWGROUP(drive)->handler = NULL; <- [1]
		schedule_timeout(1);
	}
	<- [2]
...
Ok so at event [1] we have a ->handler set on cpu0 so we pass that check. 
Then cpu1 acquires ide_lock and NULLs it out. cpu0 blocks on the lock in 
ide_set_handler and when cpu1 releases it it re-assigns ->handler. What 
happens then?
