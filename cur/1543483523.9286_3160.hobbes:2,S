I'm far from a hacker but regarding API, you should check that your
interface could support the PerfAPI effort. This API is aiming at
providing the same *programmer* interface on many OS. 
 PerfAPI - Performance Data Standard and API

Another question: does your patch support SMP systems ?
I'll try to put a link on my web page

Hope it helps,
