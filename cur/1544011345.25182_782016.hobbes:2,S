that would be important to double-check. Frederic, does the system lock up 
with a periodic 1khz HZ tick just as much? I.e. does the processing of a 
single timer interrupt take more than 1 milliseconds?
Granted, if the system is too slow to process the system clock, it's not 
useful.
But that's my point: instead of just randomly disabling functionality 
until the system gets 'fast enough' to process timer IRQs, how about 
dynamically and adaptively extending the required minimal timeout between 
hr-timer IRQs?
That will in essence self-tune the system into some minimally working 
state - instead of locking it up. Note that such a method would work with 
any source of timer IRQ slowness - not just tracing.
( And maybe the lockup is somehow hrtimer IRQ induced. If a 1khz clock
  still works for Frederic then that angle has to be investigated. )
