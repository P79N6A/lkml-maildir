Hi
I think I found a regression in 2.6.24-git. After waking up from suspend
2 ram, the fan of my laptop turns constantly at highest speed. It didn't
do this in 2.6.24.
I bisected it down to this commit:
commit c95d47a868f35cd47643d116a3c680cdaa954df8

    ACPI: Separate invocations of _GTS and _BFS from _PTS and _WAK
Reverting it resolves the problem for me, but I can't say if this makes
any sense.
My machine is a Zepto laptop with Intel Santa-Rosa chipset and I'm
running
a x86_64 Ubuntu Gutsy.
