FWIW: On my system, if I format a zip in windows, I get a strange looking
partition table on the zip when I 'fdisk /dev/hd , but can still mount it
using
mount -t vfat /dev/hdb4 /mnt/zip
The same disk works fine in Windows.
I wouldn't worry about the mangled looking partition table.
I think it might have something to do with the disks being able to
be used in Macs too. (I'm sure someone will correct me if this is wrong :)
regards,
Dave..
