Could you add some statistics gathering to measure
cumulatively how long processes wait for swapin?  Then you
could run with and without and maybe say "on average my
system waits 4 minutes a day without swap prefetch and 2
minutes with? Or if a simple sum doesn't work, some sort of
graph? Then anyone could run and measure the benefit.
Apologies if you've already thought of this...
