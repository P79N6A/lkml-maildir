Cool, thanks.  This is a very nice utility for testing, but for the
end user rather useless:
  - user starts up a private namespace in a shell, mounts something
  - then opens app from menu, tries to access mount, but the mount is
    not there
  - user unhappy
BTW, looking at -mm unshare() on namespace is not privileged any more.
Why is that?  Or rather, what's the reason, that clone() is privileged
and unshare() is not?

The one in pam-0.99.6.3-29.1 in opensuse-10.2 is totally broken.  Are
you interested in the details?  I can reproduce it, but forgot to note
down the details of the brokenness.

There _is_ a long way to go.  Random things that spring to my mind:
 - using /etc/mtab is broken with private namespaces, using
   /proc/mounts is missing various functionality, that /etc/mtab has,
   for example the "user" option, which this patchset adds
 - need to set up mount propagation from global namespace to private
   ones, mount(8) does not yet have options to configure propagation
 - user namespace setup: what if user has multiple sessions?
   1) namespaces are shared?  That's tricky because the session needs to
   be a child of a namespace server, not of login.  I'm not sure PAM
   can handle this
   2) or mounts are copied on login?  That's not possible currently,
   as there's no way to send a mount between namespaces.  Also it's
   tricky to make sure that new mounts are also shared

Trivial modulo the above slightly non-trivial exemptions ;)
