Hi  
I have a pci card and has 2 BARS that i have mapped to kernel virtual using
ioremap_nocache() and can access registers on board
from kernel space now. I would like to export these to user space so that i
can have some user level program access 
and use these registers for development purposes.
looks like mmap is way to go, but looking at some sample kernel code each
has implemented something different
thought i will check with you before...
when i call remap_page_range() 2nd arg says physical addr. iam getting
confused here which addr to use.
pci_dev gives me a addr[0] say X.
i got kernel va Y using 
   Y = io_remap_nocache()
now to remap_page_range() would i pass the Y? or virt_to_phys(Y)? or should
it be X?
Cheers,
ashokr
Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
