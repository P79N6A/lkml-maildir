I actually think it's good if we appear to be a little more "hard-liners"
than we really are. If companies assume that only open source will get
them anywhere, they'll err on the safe side. In the end, this is likely
to be to their own benefit: they won't waste time designing not-quite
open models that fail in the end (and may generate a lot of bad blood),
and can focus directly on options that make everybody happy.

Yes, also rejection can be delivered in a civilized way.
