True, but this first block doesn't really qualify as a "regression".
Yes, a clearer-than-crystal documentation of "this kernel requires
user-space component foo to be at least x.y.z if feature bar is used"
would go a long way.
And if then user-space itself was tolerant of at least version N and
N-1, then users could even roll back one kernel version if problems
arise.
Both of these are documentation and user-space issues, and don't much
depend on changes to kernel development model.

True. Regressions will always occur when driver updates happen. There'll
always be the next bug. I don't think anyone introduces these on purpose
;-)
