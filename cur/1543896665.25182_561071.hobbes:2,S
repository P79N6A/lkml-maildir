Daniel, you of all people should know. It's not the size of the patch
that matters, it's the way you use the patch ;-)
No these two patches should *not* be merged to one. If these are sitting
in -mm, and someone were to change the DRM to not to use the API and
someone else changed their driver to use the API, then what?  Does
Andrew keep these maintenance patches on top of each other?
The split lets the DRM patch be dropped or replaced while keeping the
API patch around in case another driver uses the API.
The two patches have two different objectives, even though they are
related and currently on a 1 to 1 basis. The patches regardless, should
stay separate.
