Randy,
All issues are in include/asm-x86/atomic.h
Comments as to the useful range of an atomic_t for x86 states 24-bits
atomic_add is a void.  It should return the incremented value.
atomic_sub is a void.  It should return the decremented value.
atomic_inc is a void.  It should return the incremented value.
atomic_dec is a void.  It should return the decremented value.
There is no atomic exchange.  include/asm-x86/system.h does provide a
compare exchange, but it takes an extra size parameter.
Do note that for non x86 architectures, the component library atomic
abstraction is all #define to the Linux provided functions.  Only x86
needed help because of i386 backwards compatibility which is not a goal
of the InfiniBand project.
Hope that helps.
- Fab

Besides Greg's comments:
Can (will) you provide specific examples of these differences/problems?
They need to be quashed.
Thanks.
