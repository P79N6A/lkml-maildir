Same problem here, same PHY status, on various kernels ranging from 2.0.36 to
2.2.1. I have another error message:
Feb  8 16:14:15 rigel kernel: eth0: Something Wicked happened! 2008. 
which relates to an intr_status of (IntrTxAborted | IntrTxAbort)
This has the effect of stopping all networking on this interface. I can
trigger it in two minutes by doing a bulk transfer over NFS. Works also with
rcp, did not try FTP.
One workaround for the moment is to build the Via-Rhine driver as a module,
and launch a small shell script to test if the network is up (simple ping :),
down the eth interface, unload the module and relaunch the interface. Worked
for me, I can provide the script if needed.
We should perhaps talk to Don Becker and on the netdev- list where we can
perhaps help in debugging the driver.
