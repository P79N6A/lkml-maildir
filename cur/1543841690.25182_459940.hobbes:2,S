Subject: [PATCH] eligible_child: remove an obsolete ->tgid check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

It is not possible to find a sub-thread in ->children/->ptrace_children
lists, ptrace_attach() does not allow to attach to sub-threads.
Even if it was possible to ptrace the task from the same thread group,
we can't allow to release ->group_leader while there are others (ptracer)
threads in the same group.
