No for the barrier bit we need not do the plugging, we just need to skip
the merge step and go directly to grabbing a new request. However if the
queue is indeed empty, then we do need to plug it. See?

Oh agreed, I'll get rid of one of them.

The answer is that you don't want to plug it anymore than what you do
for a regular request, but see what I wrote above.

Alright you've convinced me about that part. Will you send me the
updated patch?
