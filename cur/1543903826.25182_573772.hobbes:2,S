Not exactly what I was thinking of .. More like,
"LOCKING NOTE: This code uses the fact that get_cpu_var disables
preemption to maintain cpu affinity during the call to free_page()
otherwise it might free pages on another cpu."
(btw, your comment above comes off very snide, which I don't appreciate.
I haven't done anything that remotely warrants that.)
