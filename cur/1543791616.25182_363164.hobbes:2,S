I want to merge old IDE driver w/ libata... and drop remaining crap on the way.
If libata gains full PATA support before I do this - it is even better for me...

Do you think that libata is currently so much better wrt to PATA
hot-(un)plug support?
If so than dream on...

Ain't going to happen...
Guys, I'm not against libata PATA support - I'm all for it but I want
TRANSPARENT development and FAIR look at current state of affairs
(there is still a lot of stuff on libata's PATA TODO)...
Plus I don't like needless bashing of IDE driver which is still messy
but orders of magnitude less than during 2.4.x days... :-)
