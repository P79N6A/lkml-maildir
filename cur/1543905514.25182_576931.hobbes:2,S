Hello,
At 
http://clownix.net
 is a new software that monitors lots of things:
qdiscs, bandwidths, cpu, ram ... and presents it in a beautifull web
gui (works for IE, firefox and probably lots of other browsers).
Ajax is used and the really good X lib at cross-browser.com which
makes little windows inside the web browser.
Note: the monitored data comes from a module belonging to the tool. 
the module transmit the monitored kernel data through a netlink socket.
No screenshots, but very easy to try.
Bye
Vincent Perrier
