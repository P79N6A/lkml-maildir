I know this is probably heresy, but what would happen if we didn't merge 
all that stuff at once, and then committed to having a real 4-week cycle?
The cycles seem to be stretching out again, and I don't really think 
it's worth it to hold up the entire kernel for every single piddly 
little regression to get fixed.  We'll _never_ be perfect, even if we 
weren't slackers.
