You need not care about the Debian bugs, except the few the Debian package
maintainers have forwarded to you. Every other bug is Debian specific. The
idea is they will pass bug reports through a triage process, filter support
requests, filter bug reports that are related to their local changes, and
forward what they deem upstream bugs to you.
