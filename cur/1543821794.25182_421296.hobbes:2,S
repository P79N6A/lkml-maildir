I never read the ehca completion event handling code very carefully
until now.  But I was motivated by Shirley's work on IPoIB to take a
closer look.
It seems that you are deferring completion event dispatch into threads
spread across all the CPUs.  This seems like a very strange thing to
me -- you are adding latency and possibly causing cacheline pingpong.
It may help throughput in some cases to spread the work across
multiple CPUs but it seems strange to me to do this in the low-level
driver.  My intuition would be that it would be better to do this in
the higher levels, and leave open the possibility for protocols that
want the lowest possible latency to be called directly from the
interrupt handler.
What was the thinking that led to this design?
