Well, that's even a better idea :-) I wasn't that sure about what to do 
.. it's just that it could be misleading since the new (s/p)ata drivers 
are not living in the scsi low-level subsystem anymore, but got their 
own menu point.

   There are two drivers for Serial ATA controllers.
 
-   The main driver, "libata", exists inside the SCSI subsystem
-   and supports most modern SATA controllers.
+   The main driver, "libata", uses the SCSI subsystem
+   and supports most modern SATA controllers. In order to use it
+   you may take a look at "Serial ATA (prod) and Parallel ATA
+   (experimental) drivers".
   The IDE driver (which you are currently configuring) supports
   a few first-generation SATA controllers.
