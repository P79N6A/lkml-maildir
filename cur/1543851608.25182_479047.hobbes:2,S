Subject: [PATCH] Fix the spurious unlock_cpu_hotplug false warnings.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/3/6

Cpu-hotplug locking has a minor race case caused because of setting the
variable "recursive" to NULL *after* releasing the cpu_bitmask_lock in the
function unlock_cpu_hotplug,instead of doing so before releasing the
cpu_bitmask_lock. 
This was the cause of most of the recent false spurious lock_cpu_unlock
warnings.
This should fix the problem reported by Martin Lorenz reported in
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/29/127.
Thanks to Srinivasa DS for pointing it out.
