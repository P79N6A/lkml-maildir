Two more pieces of the puzzle:
I just shut down, turned off the power, and rebooted.  The system came
up and only found half of my memory, suggesting that I may have
hardware problems.  (I've never seen it do that before, and a second
boot recognized all 64M, so I doubt I'll see it do that again.)
After rebooting, /mnt was back to being a normal directory.
