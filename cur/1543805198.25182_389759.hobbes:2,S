An updated version is available at
     
http://arnaud.giersch.free.fr/parport_ip32/parport_ip32-0.6.patch.gz
Since all changes are non-functional ones, I did not want to flood the
lists again with the full patch.
Changes are:
  * Address comments from Andrew Morton <akpm_at_osdl.org>:
    - Style: avoid single line "if" and "case" statements.
    - Turn some printk() into pr_debug1(), so that they only exist
      in debugging mode.
    - Add a comment about "volatile".
    - Add a comment about readsb() and writesb().
  * Only define DEBUG_PARPORT_IP32 if it is not already defined.
  * Remove the CVS $Id$ line.
