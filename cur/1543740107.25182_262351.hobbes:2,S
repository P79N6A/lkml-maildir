Not all archs (of which PA-Risc is an example) seem to require the same fixups
on the same syscalls. In some instances, the upper half of the register is
implicitly zero on 32-bit syscall entry to a 64-bit kernel. In such cases,
none of my syscalls require fixing up, assuming the pointers are automatically
correct.

There's not a lot I can do about that, except wave a patch under Linus's nose
and see who complains. Can you allocate three syscall numbers for me for
parisc?
