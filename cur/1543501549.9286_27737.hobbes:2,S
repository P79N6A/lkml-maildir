Did you set your compile option at the code maturity to Y for the
experimental stuff?
That speed looks like DMA mode 2 works by default.
The BIOS could tell you that your hard disk is a block of cheese.
You would then know that something is wrong, but I am surprized that TYAN
may have blown their BIOS with a new Trinity release.
