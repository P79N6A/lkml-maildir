    struct pci_pool *
    pci_create_consistent_pool (struct pci_dev *dev, int size, int align)
and similar for freeing the pool ... pci_alloc_consistent() needs the device,
presumably since some devices may need to dma into specific memory.
I'd probably want at least "flags" from kmem_cache_create().

These should have signatures just like pci_alloc_consistent() and
pci_free_consistent() except they take the pci_pool, not a pci_dev.
Oh, and likely GFP_ flags to control blocking.

Given an agreement on API, I suspect Johannes' patch could get
quickly generalized.  Then debugging support (like in slab.c) could
be added later.
