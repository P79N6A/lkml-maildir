Linux needs to load a driver before it can access the disk. The
BIOS only works for 16-bit real-mode access.

No. You are "stuck with a driver" just like everybody else. You
either have drivers built-in (getting rare, because there are so
many), or you load a driver while booting. This is the usual
way. From the boot perspective, it doesn't matter if the module
is a 'binary' one or a GPL one.
