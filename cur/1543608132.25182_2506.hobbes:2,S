I'm currently evaluating different weights for that.
Right now I'm using :
    if (p->cpu_jtime > jiffies)
        weight += p->cpu_jtime - jiffies;
that might be too much.
Solutions :
1)
    if (p->cpu_jtime > jiffies)
        weight += (p->cpu_jtime - jiffies) >> 1;
2)
    int wtable[];
    if (p->cpu_jtime > jiffies)
        weight += wtable[p->cpu_jtime - jiffies];
Speed will like 1).
Other optimization is jiffies that is volatile and forces gcc to always
reload it.
static inline int goodness(struct task_struct * p, struct mm_struct
*this_mm, unsigned long jiff)
might be better, with jiffies taken out of the goodness loop.
Mike I suggest you to use the LatSched patch to 1) know how really is
performing the scheduler 2) understand if certain test gives certain
results due wierd distributions.
