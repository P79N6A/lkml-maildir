You're right, it's easy to add a little more redundancy that would
make it possible to recover from two consecutive nodes being
corrupted.  Keeping a parent inode id in each continuation inode is
definitely a smart thing to do.
Some minor side notes: Continuation inodes aren't really in any
defined order - if you look at Jeff's ping-pong chunk allocation
example, you'll see that the data in each continuation inode won't be
in linearly increasing order.  Also, while the current implementation
is a simple doubly-linked list, this may not be the best solution
long-term.  What's important is that each continuation inode have a
back pointer to the parent and that there is some structure for
quickly looking up the continuation inode for a given file offset.
Suggestions for data structures that work well in this situation are
welcome. :)
