If we are discussing patch #2, then that still has problems.
My comments and dirty-nasty-clobber are based on patch #2.
Patch #1 never booted and barfed a huge OOPS in CPU1.
I don't have a copy of the output but the gagging happened near this point :
VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
Freeing unused kernel memory: 48k freed
Let me make a full disk  duplication with a FastTrak and hard crash and
wreck a copy of my system.  It takes about 30-45 minutes to perform a RAID 1
hardware copy.  No, hardware RAID 1 is still vapor-ware and the darn thing
will not boot on a SMP box.............
