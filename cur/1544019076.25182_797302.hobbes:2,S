But the heuristic makes it non-deterministic, unlike memcg case. And this 
mandates special handling for cpuset constrained OOM conditions in this patch.

Userspace also needs to handle the cpuset constrained _almost-oom_'s 
specially? I wonder how easily userspace can handle that.

Yes, policy decisions will be made in user-space using this oom-controller. 
This is just a framework/means to enforce policies. We do not make any 
decisions inside the kernel.
But yes, the badness calculation by the oom killer implements some kind of 
policy inside the kernel, but I guess it can stay, as this oom-controller lets 
user policy over-ride kernel policy. ;-)
