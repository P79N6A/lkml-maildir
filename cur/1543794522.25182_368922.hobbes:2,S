Trial and error.  If you want networking to survive with no memory other
than the critical pool for 2 minutes, for example, you pick a random value,
block all other allocations (I have a test patch to do this), and send a
boatload of packets at the box.  If it OOMs, you need a bigger pool.
Lather, rinse, repeat.

On the receive side, you can't. :(  You *have* to allocate an skbuff for
the packet, and only a couple levels up the networking 7-layer burrito can
you tell if you can toss the packet as non-critical or keep it.  On the
send side, you can create a simple socket flag that tags all that socket's
SEND requests as critical.

We did this because we didn't want __GFP_CRITICAL allocations  dipping into
the pool in the case of a transient low mem situation.  In those cases we
want to force the task to do writeback to get a page (as usual), so that
the critical pool will be full when the system REALLY goes critical.  We
also open the in_emergency file when the app starts so that we can just
write to it and don't need to try to open it when kswapd is going nuts.
