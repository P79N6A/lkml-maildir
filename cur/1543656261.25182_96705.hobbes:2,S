Hi all,
As I asked later this day.. my L2 cache is'nt detected on my dual p3 550.
But I have another fuzy problem,
all application take more cpu power in smp ( like xmms who was taking .3% take around 3% under and SMP kernel ( I use ps axuf to say this ) ) .. I think the bug came from the kernel(2.4.18) since I build the smp kernel before adding my second processor and it was using as much cpu .. and another fuzzy problem,
Sometime ( read one time at each 15 min ) the cpu0 OR cpu1 get more and more loaded till it get 100% of cpu load and then it reget back to 0%.
My question is .. do update my kernel to a 2.4.20 ( or another version ) should fix my problem, also could upgrading to another kernel should debug my cache problem ?? BTW, I'm not using an Debian stock kernel.. I build it yesterday from real scratch.. (make clean dep; make bzImage;... ) 
My board is an AMI MegaRUM II with two p3 SL3FJ. I'm in Dual head with matrox driver for my G400.
Thank you all in advence for your solution.. 
Xavier LaRue
