dma_mask should be a pointer, I mean, the element in struct device, see below,
struct device {
	struct list_head node;		/* node in sibling list */
	struct list_head bus_list;	/* node in bus's list */
	struct list_head driver_list;
	struct list_head children;
	struct device 	* parent;
	struct kobject kobj;
	char	bus_id[BUS_ID_SIZE];	/* position on parent bus */
	struct bus_type	* bus;		/* type of bus device is on */
	struct device_driver *driver;	/* which driver has allocated this
					   device */
	void		*driver_data;	/* data private to the driver */
	void		*platform_data;	/* Platform specific data (e.g. ACPI,
					   BIOS data relevant to device) */
	struct dev_pm_info	power;
	u32		detach_state;	/* State to enter when device is
					   detached from its driver. */
	u64		*dma_mask;	/* dma mask (if dma'able device) */
	u64		coherent_dma_mask;/* Like dma_mask, but for
					     alloc_coherent mappings as
					     not all hardware supports
					     64 bit addresses for consistent
					     allocations such descriptors. */
	struct list_head	dma_pools;	/* dma pools (if dma'ble) */
	struct dma_coherent_mem	*dma_mem; /* internal for coherent mem
					     override */
	void	(*release)(struct device * dev);
};
