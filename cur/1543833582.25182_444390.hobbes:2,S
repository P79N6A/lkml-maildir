Yes.

Abit KX7-333 (VIA Apollo KT266/A/333).
I also tried disabling ACPI completely, and the system booted without 
the quirk applied. I was of the suspicion that if I could get IO-APIC 
enabled, then the system would be unable to boot, but this is only 
guesswork based on the info in the Gentoo bug report.
Perhaps we can discount my system, but Aiko Barz's case from the Gentoo 
bug should definitely be considered: Without ACPI, the quirk is not 
needed. With ACPI, the quirk is needed.
