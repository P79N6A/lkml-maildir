I don't think that will happen.  pte-highmem is relatively new code, and
needs more testing before it goes into 2.4.  Hugh, and Andrea fixed some
potential problems with it recently, so hopefully most of it is ironed out
now.
Also, Andrea and Marcelo (CCed) need to take some time to merge some of -aa into
2.4-pre.  Any comments guys?  We're all watching and waiting to see more
merging in this area...
