I am now using a kernel with only this patch (reapplied ec/battery which
you sent me).

This does not occur with this patch.
But there is still the strange thing that
	ACPI: Battery Slot [BAT1] (battery absent)
is present in the dmesg, while 
	$ acpi
	     Battery 1: charging, 46%, 00:00:49 until charged
But this seems to be a minor issue. Thanks a lot.
Best wishes
Norbert

DUNBAR (n.)
A highly specialised fiscal term used solely by turnstile
operatives at Regnet's Part zoo. It refers to the variable amount of
increase in the variable gate takings on a Sunday afternoon, caused by
persons going to the zoo because they are in love and believe that the
feeling of romance will be somehow enhanced by the smell of panther
sweat and rank incontinence in the reptile house.
