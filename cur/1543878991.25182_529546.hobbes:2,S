Correct, no oversight here; but it may be more meaningful, if you could 
default select child-options based on the parent-state, like HW_RANDOM.
Also, I don't think it's necessary to touch any of the "depends on"; keep 
them as is, as they don't hurt staying that way, and may actually be 
necessary under certain circumstances.  (see EMBEDDED)
