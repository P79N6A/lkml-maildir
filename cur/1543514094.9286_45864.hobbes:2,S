You can't change the license on the code.  If you use freer than GPL code as
part of a GPL source base, you can distribute the whole lot as GPL.  You can
still distribute the non-GPL code under its non-GPL license if you extract it
from the GPL source base.  If someone modifies the non-GPL code, they create a
derivative work which is still covered by the original license.  You can't add
a patch to non-GPL code and declare the patch to be GPL, nor does anyone other
than the copyrigth holder have the right to change the license.
