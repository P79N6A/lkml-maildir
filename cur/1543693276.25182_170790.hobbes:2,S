Doesn't the input layer add a timestamp to every event? 
At least that's the impression I have from xxd /dev/input/eventN: the
first eight bytes of each 16 bytes packet look so furiously close to
a struct timeval that they can't be anything else :-)
Just that I don't know how the devices and N are associated, it seems to be
order of discovery/registering at boot.
