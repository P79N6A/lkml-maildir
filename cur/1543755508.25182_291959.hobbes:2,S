I agree.  Format conversion should be done in healthy system separately 
and we should restrict what to do while taking the dump as few as 
possible.  Conversion from just memory image to crash/lcrash format will 
be very useful to use existing tools and experiences.   I already have 
such tool and (if my administration allows) I can make such tool open. 
Let me do some paperwork.
