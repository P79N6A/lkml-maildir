No, it's pretty small to create a ram-based filesystem these days.  Look
at securityfs and debugfs for two simple examples that you should copy
if you want to create your own.  If you can come up with ways of making
those files smaller, then that would be great.  But as it is, it is
_really_ simple to do this right now, especially with two working
examples to copy from :)
