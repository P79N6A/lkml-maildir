I my initial mail I wrote that I'm talking about user-mode-linux. So for
example you compile a program, copy it into your user-mode-linux filesystem,
and it won't work anymore. (recompiling is also not an option, who has a 
kernel source installed inside his user-mode-linux root filesystem).
and what happens if you recompile your kernel with a different HZ (because
of tc's TBF or something)... then you would have to recompile your userspace
application afterwards?
nah. That's not a solution.
I'd say:
- Either change all sysctl variables to be HZ-independent, or
- Create a sane way to read HZ from the running kernel.
Everything else is broken, from my point of view.
