How about _removing_ the io-wait bonus for waiting on pipes then?
If you wait for disk io, someone else gets to use
the cpu for their work.  So you get a boost for
giving up your share of time, waiting
for that slow device.
But if you wait for a pipe, you wait for some other
cpu hog to do the first part of _your_ work.
I.e. nobody else benefitted from your waiting,
so you don't get any boost either.
This solves the problem of someone artifically
dividing up a job, using token passing
to get unfair priority.
This can be fine-tuned a bit: We may want the pipe-waiter
to get a _little_ bonus at times, but that has to be
subtracted from whatever bonus the process at the
other end of the pipe has.  I.e. no new bonus
created, just shift some the existing bonus around.
The "other end" may, after all, have gained legitimate
bonus from waiting on the disk/network/paging/os, and passing
some of that on to "clients" might make sense.
So irman and similar pipe chains wouldn't be able to build
artifical priority, but if it get some priority
in an "acceptable" way then it is passed
along until it expires.
I.e. "bzcat file.bz2 | grep something | sort | less" could
pass priority down the chain when bzcat suffers
a long nfs wait...
