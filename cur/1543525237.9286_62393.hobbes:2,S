One more thing that needs cleaning up in e2compr:
Looking at the documentation in Readme.e2compr, I'm afraid I have to
agree with the comment here:

Looking at the documentation above, it's not clear why the two on-disk flags 
EXT2_CLEANUP_FL and EXT2_DIRTY_FL exist.  I kinda see the reasoning
behind EXT2_DIRTY_FL, but not EXT2_CLEANUP_FL.  The documentation needs
to better explain what's going on at a high-level, and not at a
low-level (I can read the source for that), but more importantly, this
is another area where the on-disk format looks a little dirty, and
perhaps should be cleaned up before e2compr gets folded into the
kernel.  
I suspect that EXT2_DIRTY_FL can go away entirely on the on-disk format,
but that's only after taking a brief look at the code.  (You may still
need the additional cleanup flags in the in-kernel inode, if I
understand things correctly --- the documentation's a little sparse here
--- but I'm pretty sure one on-disk bit is all you need.  And if you do
need more than one bit, what the bits mean should be documented.)
