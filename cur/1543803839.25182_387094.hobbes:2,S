Here is patch to clarify the test. I'd be glad if someone could make
the tests more accurate. This ultimately comes down to a concept of
ownership of page by a process / mm_struct that we have to approximate.

Explain the complicated check in migrate_page_add by putting the logic
into a separate function migration_check. This way any enhancements can
be easily added.
