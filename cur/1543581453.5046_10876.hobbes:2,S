I concur this, I watched a DVD tonight, and actually it got so bad
I had to reboot at one point as the it became too jerky to watch.
free output looked like this at this point...
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        254960     253252       1708          0      24116     174500
-/+ buffers/cache:      54636     200324
Swap:       248996      20848     228148
It appeared, that rather than free the cached buffers and reuse the
memory, it preferred to hit swap space. Streaming I/O performance seems
to have taken a hit lately.
(This was 2.4.1-ac9 btw)
