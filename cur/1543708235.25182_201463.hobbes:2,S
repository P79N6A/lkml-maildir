I'm glad for that particular response :)
I happen to have such a card in a computer here. Right now it's not used
for anything in particular (waiting for things to stabilising a bit) so
I can test out patches without worrying about any data on it, so feel
free to suggest things to try.
Is there any active development done on it?
My current working conditions (and lack of specs for the card) prevents me
 from doing much work on it myself atm, but is there perhaps another way of
following the development on that part a bit more closely?
I have done my (small, but still... :) ) share of driver development and
low-level coding (company I work for makes me write code for their embedded
devices and sometimes drivers for the PC-interfaces) so I might just be
able to pitch in with an idea or two.
