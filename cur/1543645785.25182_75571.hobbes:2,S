Pavel,
I pointed out to you various other device other than disk support DMA, and
moving the suspend point up to the mainloop away from the subdrivers.
This would insure the entire sub-system is out.  Why are we block after
the request has been sent to the sub-driver?  Why do you see this the
preferred location and not before it enters the system?  Given that you
have stated it does not parse the difference between S3 v/s S4, I am
graveful concerned.  However, if this is how you and Linus have decide to
impliment this project, I shall attempt to sustain interoperablity.
Sigh ...
