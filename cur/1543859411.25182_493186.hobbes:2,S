Well, I thought I understood, you just shattered that.

I wondered where you were ;-) Enjoy your time away from the computer.

I was still thinking about why exactly, but indeed since mprotect does I
thought it prudent to also do it.

Ah, good point, makes sense I guess.

Hmm, quite right indeed. I missed that. So moving the flush inside the
pte cleared section closed a race. It seems I must have a long hard look
at these architecture manuals...

Arjan argued that mprotect and msync would mostly race with themselves
in userspace.

page_mkclean_one() fix
it had several issues:
 - it failed to flush the cache
 - a race wrt tlb flushing
 - it failed to do s390 (s390 guys, please verify this is now correct)
Also, clear in a loop to ensure SMP safeness as suggested by Arjan.
