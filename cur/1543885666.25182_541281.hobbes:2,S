With a hardware controller which allows no direct access to the flash.

Err, where does JFFS2 use a block emulation layer ?

Are you going to make logfs play with UBI ?

I don't. It seems fs developers tend to have their own view of how to
get stuff mainline.
The code is far from being useful on real world hardware. The error
handling via BUG() is just making it useless. 
Also please fix the coding style and other issues from the seperate
review.
Some useful comments would make a functional review way easier.
