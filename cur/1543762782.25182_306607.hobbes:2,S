Hi,
I have 2 modules. The first one uses EXPORT_SYMBOL to make some function 
available to other modules. These prototypes for these functions were 
also put in a header file. Now the second module uses the functions the 
functions defined in the first module by and includes the afore 
mentioned header file. However when i'm compiling the module, I get a 
symbol underfined warning. When I load the module it works as expected. 
Is there any way to get rid of these warnings.
Another problem I'm having is that when I load the second module I get 
`no version for "rbnode_initialize" found: kernel tainted.' 
(rbnode_initialize is one of the functions exported by the first 
module). Both MODULE_LICENSE("GPL"); and MODULE_VERSION are declared in 
the two modules. Is there anything I'm missing?
Thanks
Josef Galea
