Subject: esound over tcp problem with linux-2.4.0-test[89]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Package: esound
Version: 0.2.19
i've emailed various people about this already, but i've figured out a
couple new things.
basically, when i added ram to my linux-2.4.0-test8 box taking it from
96M to 192M of ram. esd over tcpip started popping, hesitating,
distorting.  if i limit the memory at kernel boot to 127M (and no
more) it works fine.  also if i convince esd to use unix sockets
(which took a patch and recompile from debian source) it also works
with any my 192M ram.  tcp seems broken in stock esound source too.
other people have confirmed this problem.
is this a kernel problem or an esd problem?  thank you.
