Hi all again.
Actually, I´ve found that problem is on awe_wave module, ´cause i´ve restarted my system w/o autoload of awe_wave mod, and the
system runs out of troubles. Also, i´ve seen before restart the following info:
hquest:~# lsmod
(...)
awe_wave      (...) [1] (uninitialized)
(...)
hquest:~# _
other thing (not related to sb): these lines came after a depmod -a:
/lib/modules/2.3.2/misc/usb-uhci.o: unresolved symbol(s)
/lib/modules/2.3.2/misc/usb-ohci.o: unresolved symbol(s)
/lib/modules/2.3.2/misc/usb-ohci-hcd.o: unresolved symbol(s)
/lib/modules/2.3.2/fs/hfs.o: unresolved symbol(s)
thanks again.
