Bah, I'm not sure anymore. I have two motherboards. Asus CUV-266DLS and
Rioworks SDVIA. Both are dual cpu P3 motherboards. The first has a Via
Apollo Pro 266 chipset, while the Rioworks has a Via Apollo Pro 133A. I
have two graphics-adapters. ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder, and one ATI Radeon
9700 Pro.
With the SDVIA board, I get dri to work with both vga-cards. (On the
Radeon 9700 using the ATI-binary drivers.)
On the Asus, I have to load agpgart with agp_try_unsupported=1. Then I
get the old Radeon AIW to work perfectly with dri, but with the 9700, my
box crashes hard everytime I try anything 3d related.
But this can probably be blamed on the ATI-binary drivers? I just wanted
to let you know.
