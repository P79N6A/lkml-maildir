Actually, I've ran both of them at least a few times this boot.
I think I've found what's doing it...xmms with the avi-xmms plugin will
cause the message to appear at startup even without playing anything. 
Moving the libraries out of the /usr/lib/xmms/Input directory and
starting xmms again will not produce any message.  I only just recently
downloaded this plugin which is probably why I didn't see it before.
It's also happening on my second (non-DRI) head, so it's probably not
related to that (I'll reboot and try again without any DRI modules loaded
and see).
