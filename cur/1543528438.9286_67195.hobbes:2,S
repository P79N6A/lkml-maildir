Today's maintenance update:
ftp://icaftp.epfl.ch/pub/people/almesber/misc/bootimg-6.tar.gz
This cleans up the code a bit and fixes a few embarrassing but
apparently benign bugs. bootimg(8) now also checks a flag in the target
kernel (if zImage or bzImage) that indicates whether it supports being
booted by bootimg, so you have to update any old targets to bootimg-6
(there's no check for ELF or plain binary, but, of course, if they
don't support being booted by bootimg, they won't work either).

P.S. No luck with my attempt to boot monster kernels (>> 1 MB compressed)
     yet, though. But this is probably not directly related to bootimg.
