Uhm simple.
1) it's using software raid (note - NOT md).  Software raid5 &
journaling filesystems in v2.2 don't get along.
2) reiserfs kept changing their on disk format until recently.  We can't
just reformat 500gb of data every few weeks.
3) journaling wasn't available when these large filesystems went online,
and we wasn't going to reformat just for journaling.
That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.
