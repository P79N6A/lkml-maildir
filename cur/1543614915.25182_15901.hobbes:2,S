I don't know if this is needed any more, in case Alan has a pending patch
already. But none of my three home machines can boot 2.2.20 zImages from
LILO:
486 (133 MHz): motherboard MG-PCI 486, chipset UMC880, AMIBIOS from year
1993.
pentium (MMX 150 MHz): IBM Thinkpad 310 E.
athlon (TB 1400 MHz): motherboard Abit KG7-RAID, AMD760/VIA686, Award BIOS.
