I've looked at your warnings. They're all totally harmless, and caused
by safety checks against some defines in those functions. While in 2.6,
the two checks in vt.c have been removed, I can't be sure that nobody
in 2.4 changes the defines (eg: embedded systems) in which case the
checks would be totally valid.
So I will leave them. It may look annoying but it's a safe measure IMHO.
Best regards,
Willy
