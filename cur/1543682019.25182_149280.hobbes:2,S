I fail to see the problem with having rmmod do exactly
what you ask it to do.
If there is some refcounting bug, you will see it, because rmmod will
spin sleeping and waiting for all the net_dev refcounts to go away.
This will spit out kernel messages and only occur when there is a bug
in the kernel somewhere.
