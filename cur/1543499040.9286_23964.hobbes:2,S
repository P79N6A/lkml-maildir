Yes, but not in 5.2, which was sold up to 6-8 months ago and it's based
on libc5. 
I checked their last updates to 5.2, just as an example:
    util (411 Kb) 29-Jun-98 
	util 2.6-13: util-2.6 with fdisk from util-linux-2.8 
	(can handle new extended partitions)
Are they cheating us?
The kernel quality vs. distributions is completely unfair. And I am
starting to understand to the "IT managers", Linux distributions suck.
