I assume you are talking about 2.4.18?

It seems some experimental support for your chipset was added in later 
2.4 kernels.
Could you try whether kernel 2.4.24 with the alim15x3 driver available 
in the kernel configuration at
  ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support
    ATA/IDE/MFM/RLL support
    IDE, ATA and ATAPI Block devices
      PCI IDE chipset support
      Generic PCI bus-master DMA support
      ALI M15x3 chipset support
works for you?
