Hi,
[CC'd Len since he might want/be able to help despite this being VIA issue ;)]

OK, I debugged it some more, and I noticed some very strange ACPI status
again...
$ cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/*
processor id:            0
acpi id:                 0
bus mastering control:   no
power management:        no
throttling control:      no
limit interface:         no
<not supported>
active state:            C0
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     00000000
maximum allowed latency: 2000 usec
states:
<not supported>
HOWEVER (dmesg.log.gz):
ACPI: CPU0 (power states: C1[C1] C2[C2])
and
ACPI: lapic on CPU 0 stops in C2[C2]
So according to /proc/acpi/ I don't even *have* C1/C2, however
it's still being used.
Oh, wait, I just realized that of course I'm in 2.6.19-rc1-mm1 currently,
however booting into 2.6.19-rc4-mm1 *does* list C1/C2 states in /proc/acpi/,
in contrast to -rc1-mm1.
That would explain why 2.6.19-rc1-mm1 has no issues whatsoever with dynticks
- since it never even enters C1/C2!
OK, so dynticks in Linux > 2.6.19-rc1-mm1 broke because ACPI C1/C2
suddenly became available which killed my VIA APIC timer in C2.
How probable is it that the APIC timer got killed due to mis-programming
in Linux versus VIA chipset design garbage probability? I.e. do you think
there's a chance to fix C2 malfunction by going into the innards of
VIA chipsets operation?
How useful would it be to simply disable C2 operation (but not C1)
in CONFIG_NO_HZ mode after's been determined to kill APIC timer?:

Hmm, processor_idle.c in current -dynticks4 seems to contain code to do just
that: disable C states after they've been found harmful to timer operation?
But somehow it doesn't seem to work for me here, obviously.
If I don't get any further input on that I'll try to debug it myself soon.

is quite informative about APIC timer issues etc., BTW.
