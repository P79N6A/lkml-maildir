Hi Greg,
Now that debugfs is merged into Linus's tree, I'm looking at using it
to replace the IPoIB debugging pseudo-filesystem (ipoib_debugfs).  Is
there any guidance on what the structure of debugfs should look like?
Right now I'm planning on putting all the debug info files under an
ipoib/ top level directory.  Does that sound reasonable?
Thanks,
  Roland
