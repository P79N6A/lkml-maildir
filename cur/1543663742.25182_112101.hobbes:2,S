the 32M case is probably fine with it, you moved the limit of in-flight
I/O in the writeback layer, and the write throttling will limit the
amount of ram in flight to 16M or so. I would be much more interesting
to see some latency benchmark on a 8G machine with 4G simultaneously
locked in the I/O queue. a 4G queue on a IDE disk can only waste lots of
cpu and memory resources, increasing the latency too, without providing
any benefit. Your 4G queue thing provides only disavantages as far as I
can tell.

2.4 on desktop boxes could fill all ram with locked and dirty stuff
because of the excessive size of the queue, so any comparison with 2.4
in terms of page reclaim should be repeated on 2.4.21pre4aa3 IMHO, where
the VM has a chance not to find the machine in collapsed state where the
only thing it can do is to either wait or panic(), feel free to choose
what you prefer.
