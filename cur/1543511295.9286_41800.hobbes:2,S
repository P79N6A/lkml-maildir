I had a similar problem a while ago, and it turned out I left out a line
in my isapnp.conf so the card wasn't being configured properly.  It worked
for a while, but then mysteriously broke until I noticed this problem.
I'd check that and make sure each of the devices on the sound card is
being activated.  Also make sure the kernel is looking at the right IRQ,
etc.
If you need some more information on the isapnptools (or need isapnptools)
you should be able to find it at:

Or if your card isn't PNP (as I'm not familiar with it) you can just beat
me over the head with a blunt object.
