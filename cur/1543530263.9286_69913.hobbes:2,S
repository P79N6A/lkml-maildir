I think the right answer is to use fcntl and have one file:
#include <fcntl.h>
that includes all fcntls. We don't need to specify which file system.
Some file systems might not support all the fcntls.
We should change/add ext2's ioctls to fcntls and have a call from
sys_fcntl to a file system specific fcntl if the generic fcntl doesn't
know about the cmd given.
The collision between driver ioctls and fcntls worries me.
These are really separate functions.
If Linux/Linus doesn't want to do this, we should have one file with all
ioctls. I see that there is /usr/include/bits/ioctls.h and
/usr/include/asm/ioctls.h. But, ext2's ioctls are in an ext2 specific file:
linux/include/linux/ext2_fs.h for 2.3.*.
These are defined as:
/*
 * ioctl commands
 */
#define EXT2_IOC_GETFLAGS               _IOR('f', 1, long)
#define EXT2_IOC_SETFLAGS               _IOW('f', 2, long)
#define EXT2_IOC_GETVERSION             _IOR('v', 1, long)
#define EXT2_IOC_SETVERSION             _IOW('v', 2, long)
What should XFS or any other file system do with these? I guess they
should return EINVAL.  What if we accidentally or purposely get called
with this?  Applications don't normally check which file system they are
running on.  I don't suspect that all file systems should be including
linux/include/linux/ext2_fs.h.
I think the above should be moved into one of the ioctls.h or changed
to be fcntls.
I guess the way to fix all this is to make a patch and see if it gets
accepted. Suggestions?
Thanks,
Jim
