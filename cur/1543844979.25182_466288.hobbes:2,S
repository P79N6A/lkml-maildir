Hi,
This one is originally from Ian Dall via bugzilla.kernel.org - Ian if
you wish to add a Signed-off-by please do, couldn't add it since you
didn't leave one in bugzilla.
Anyway the patch seems obviously correct (famous last words) and it
would be nice to get into 2.6.19.
Thanks,
Jes
Original patch from Ian Dall in bugzilla. Set command timeout as
specified by the SCSI layer rather than hardcode it to 30 seconds. I
have received a couple of reports of people hitting this one with
various tape configurations and the patch looks obviously correct.
                                                                  - Jes
From

ian@beware.dropbear.id.au (Ian Dall):
The command sent to the card was using a 30second timeout regardless of the
timeout requested in the scsi command passed down from higher levels.
