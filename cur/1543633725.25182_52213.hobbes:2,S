Yes! It's a simulation/emulation application.

This can be a solution.

Yes!

Depending by the threading library, if it's totaly userspace or not!
With so many thread that aren't totaly userspace the scheduler
performances/caratteristics are much important. I prefer a mixed
solution for example. Because some problem can be easily resolved
with a userspace threads and other not.
