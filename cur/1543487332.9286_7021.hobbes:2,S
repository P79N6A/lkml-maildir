Hi,
Recently we ran into the following network problem:
Network topology:
                        Production backbone
        --------+----------------------------+-------------
                |       ---> 1               |
                |       <--  2               |
           mac1 |       ---> 3          mac2 |
           ip1  |                       ip2  |
         .------------.               .-------------.
         |            |               |             |
         |    FW      |               |    MHH      |
         |            |               `-------------'
         |            | mac4                 | ip3
         |            | ip4                  | mac3
         |            |----------------------+--------
         |            |    <--- 4 Maintenance backbone
         `------------'    ---> 5
                |          <--- 6
                |
                |
                |
         .------------.
         |            |
         |    PC      |
         |            |
         `------------'
The firewall FW routes 'forward' traffic from PC to the ip2 via the
production backbone. The Multi-Homed-Host MHH routes the return traffic
via the maintenance backbone.
The FW reports changes in MAC address for the production interface of the
MHH, ip2.  Running tcpdump on FW reveals the following scenario:
1. PC tries to connect to ip2 (HTTP request
2. FW issues an arp-request (asking for mac2) on the production
   backbone: packet 1
3. MHH replies with an arp-reply: packet 2
4. FW sends first IP packet to MHH: packet 3
5. MHH issues an arp-request (asking for mac4) on the maintenance
   backbone: packet 4
6. FW replies with an arp-reply: packet 5
7. MHH sends first IP return packet to FW: packet 6.
This should work but the arp-request from MHH, packet 4, contains unexpected
information:
source hardware addres = mac3
source protocol address = ip2 (I expected ip3)
destination hardawre addres = NULL
destination protocal addres = ip4
This packet forces the FW to change its arp-cache: the mac addres for ip2
is set to mac3. This effectively blocks all traffic between PC end MHH
How to solve this ?? Regrettable we cannot change the routing configuration.
Greetings, Eric.
