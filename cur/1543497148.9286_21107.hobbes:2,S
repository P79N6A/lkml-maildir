I rememeber some talk a while ago about having an option of making system
beep of "System halted" message is displayed. 
Is anyone working on it ? Is there a patch available ? 
Also can someone tell me the answer to this question:
in kernel/sys.c:sys_reboot we have the following piece of code:
	case LINUX_REBOOT_CMD_HALT:
		notifier_call_chain(&reboot_notifier_list, SYS_HALT,NULL);
		printk(KERN_EMERG "System halted.\n");
		machine_halt();
		do_exit(0);
		break;
I always thought that when I see "System halted" it means I can turn off
the computer safely. Is this true ? Why do we need machine_halt() and
do_exit(0) instructions ?? Why do we need a call to schedule in do_exit() ?
                             thank you
