Subject: [patch 3/3] Support removal of unused dentry entries via SLUB defrag interface
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/17/20

This patch allows the removal of unused dentry entries in a partial
populated slab page. Very limited (yet) in what it can do for reclaim
but this catches bad cases in which we have a long list of partial
slabs with a few entries in each of them. We can free up the slabs
that have only unused dentry entries in them.
get_dentry() uses the dcache lock and then works with dget_locked
to obtain a reference to the dentry. An additional complication is that
the dentry may be in process of being freed or it may just have been
allocated. In that case d_inode is NULL. If we discover this then we
simply stay away from the object and return 1 to indicate to the
defrag logic that this object will be free. Otherwise we increment
the refcount and return success.
kick_dentry() is called after get_dentry_reference() has
been used and after the slab has dropped all of its own locks. The dentry
pruning for unused entries works in a straighforward way.
Note: The code here could be significantly improved. If we could
get to a point where all used dentries could be moved then full
dentry slab defragmentation and vacating of dentry slab pages would
become possible.
