Subject: [PATCH] minor PCI fixup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2001/4/10/209

Attached is a very minor patch that is in my tree (I don't even remember why
I was in there) which uses the defined PCI vendor ID instead of a number.
Cheers, Andreas
