David/Alan,
Andre Hedrick is now the CTO of TRG and Chief Scientist over Linux
Development.  After talking 
to him, we are going to do our own ring 0 2.4 and 2.2.x code bases for
the MANOS merge.  
the uClinux is interesting, but I agree is limited.  
MANOS schedules should be unaffected.  The current DLL prototype of
Linux 2.2 is ring 0, but I shudder at trying to merge all the changes
I've done to it into core 2.2.X as a .config
option.  There's also the gravity well forces of different views to this
effort.  With Andre 
on the job, I am more confident in co-opting the Linux drivers and just
biting the bullet 
on the support issues, and doing a full fork of Linux.
