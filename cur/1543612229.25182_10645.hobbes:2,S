That could cause very subtle deadlocks.   I'd prefer to do:
#define del_timer_async	del_timer
and to then put out the word that del_timer is a deprecated
interface and code should use either del_timer_sync or
del_timer_async.
That way, we can grep through the tree and see which code
has not yet been reviewed/fixed.
