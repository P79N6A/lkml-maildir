BIOS has setting whether IRQ should be assigned to the VGA card
or not - default is not, and if you'll leave it this way, you'll get
no IRQ:
platan:~# lspci -s 0:0e.0 -vb
00:0e.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Rage XL (rev 27) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
        Subsystem: ATI Technologies Inc Rage XL
        Flags: bus master, stepping, medium devsel, latency 66, IRQ 255
        Memory at 51000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
        I/O ports at 1000
        Memory at 50001000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable)
        Capabilities: [5c] Power Management version 2
If you'll change BIOS's setting, your Nvidia (or vsync code on matroxfb) should 
work.
