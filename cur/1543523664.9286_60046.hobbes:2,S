I want to excuse me to You all guys if my english is not so good to explain
my feels
but has someone realized that I _want_ to include this patch into the kernel
?
I've reported only code and numbers, to be evaluated together with guys that
have a experience
greater than mine, these are only code and numbers.
I _want_ exactly nothing.
So Larry, don't mine my education to leave place for flames that not are
well suited in this
techincal list, and please stop Your personal crusade against guys that
_want_ to change the
scheduler and want childs to have bad nightmares thinking about kernel code.

The mathematic is mathematic, and its beauty is that leave no space to
politicants ;)
If You think that an RQ = 2 can result in 759000 switch / sec, then You're
right this is
a 3 % difference. But even heavy benchmarks ( SpecWebXX, etc .. ) shows that
plotting
in a XY graphic the switch / sec versus the RQ length, the curve intersect
the line X = 2
in a range for 1200 to 2000. So taking the higher one, results that the
patch will give
a 0.0086 % performance loose for RQ = 2. And this is mathematic plus real
experience.

As Your great experience taught me these are the lower limit of a 16 test
set.

This is the code ( sorry I forgot to include the bench software ) used to
test :
<CODE>
/*
 * Original version by Willy Terreau
 * Modified by Davide Libenzi
 */
void            oneatwork(int thr)
{
    long long int counter = 0;
    while (!stop) /* Is writed only at the end of the test */
    {
        if (count) /* Is writed only at the end of the test */
            ++counter;
        syscall(158); /* sys_sched_yield() */
    }
    totalwork[thr] = counter;
    pthread_exit(0);
}
</CODE>
This is a pure switching time test.
It is a _real_ switching test, that can be used to test switching times
under _certain_
RQ loads :
vmstat of a "lat_ctx -s 0 20" give no more than 5-6 tasks in RQ
vmstat of a "threads 20 xx" give always an RQ = 20 ( with no need of cost
compensation )
Now, as even my sister ( that works in business ) can realize this code is
stored
entirely in cache, and the write to the counter is onto the process stack.
I _want_ this behaviour coz I _want_ a measure of clean switching times by
keeping
cache issues ot of the test.

I'm asking to You Larry ( and to others ) to prove the "dramatically worse
performance"
( with low RQ ) of this patch in the same way I've reported my "code and
numbers".
Or better if You've not time to do it, point me where I can find a test
suite that
can prove what are You saying. I'll do it for You ( but I don't have an SMP
machine :( ).
If tests will reports this "dramatically worse performance" of the patch
I'll be _really_ happy to give it to my cat for dinner.

As the tons of question marks at the end of my message reveals,
and as I've even said, I'm all but sure about the convenience of the patch i
nclusion,
so We can agree here Larry.
PS:
I include the "instrument" used for my measures.
Always with respect,
Davide.
