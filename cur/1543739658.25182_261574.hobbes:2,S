I am not sure what you mean by basic text output? If you mean to a 
display, then yes, embedded boxes using U-Boot and OpenBIOS usually do 
not have any text output. But if you mean serial output that is usually 
the method of choice for the embedded machines that don't have support 
for a physical display in the firmware.
