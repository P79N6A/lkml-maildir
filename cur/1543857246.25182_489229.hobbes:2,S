Subject: SCSI Controler SCRU32 becomes realy slow on the latest kernels

I am using here 2 machines with the ICP Vortex SCSI-Controler SCRU32 for some 
years now.
After switching one machine from Debian 3.1 (sarge, with Kernel 2.6.8) to the 
upcoming Debian 4.0 (etch with Kernel 2.6.17 or 2.6.18) I have noticed that 
my scsi-devices become very slow while there is also a dramatical increase in
the sys time needed for I/O operations.
The machine is a dual processor Xeon system (2 * 2.2 GHz) with 2 GB memory.
The used scsi drives are seagate R10k and R15k disks.
i.e.  reading 1 GB from the first SCSI drive takes about:
xen-1:/var/log# time dd if=/dev/sda bs=256k count=4000 of=/dev/null
4000+0 records in
4000+0 records out
1048576000 bytes (1.0 GB) copied, 55.3079 seconds, 19.0 MB/s
real    0m55.361s
user    0m0.368s
sys     0m49.107s
There are two strange things: 
   1. The transfer rate is only 19 MB/sec what is very low for this machine.
       The expected value would be at least 50 MB/sec.
   2. the system time is in the same range as the real time and thats
       realy annoying,  on the old kernel the system time for such an operatin
       was about 7 sec.
Thanks for any help
Hartmut
