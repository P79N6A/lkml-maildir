I'll add three more conditions to be explicit:
    * A futex on a MAP_PRIVATE must be mm-local: the canonical
    * example being MAP_PRIVATE of /dev/zero.
    * A FUTEX_WAIT on an unwritten mapping should be woken by a
    * FUTEX_WAKE to the same address after writing.
    * A FUTEX_WAIT on a read-only mapping should wait for the same
    * thing from other processes as if it were a writable mapping.

Unfortunately I think the above 5 conditions do not have a consistent
solution.  Please prove me wrong :)
