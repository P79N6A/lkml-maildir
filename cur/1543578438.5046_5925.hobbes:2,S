   i believe it might still make some limited sense for normal sendmsg()
   and higher MTUs (or 8k NFS) - we could copy & checksum stuff into the
   ->tcp_page if SG is possible and thus the SG capability improves the VM.
   (because we can allocate at PAGE_SIZE granularity.)
Basically what your advocating for is to take advantage of SG-only
devices when we have full control of the page contents.
Sure this would work.
But honestly the real gain from SG-only devices would be (as you know)
the memory usage savings when sending a single static file object to
several thousand clients.
