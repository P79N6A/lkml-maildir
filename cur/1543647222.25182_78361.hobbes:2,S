First of all, please don't use such addresses.
By spec, auto-configured link-local address is fe80::/64
and connected route should be /64.
If you do really want to use such addresses (like fe80:1920::10),
you can put another route by yourself, at your own risk.
We should not configure in such way by default.
and, we should even have to add "discard" route for them 
by default for safe.
