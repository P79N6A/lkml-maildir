This merger seems to be difficult :)
2.3.40-1 make oldconfig deletes the selection of PCMCIA, but
pcmcia-cs.11-Jan still requires it. What is the relation between
hot-swappable devices and pcmcia? With 2.3.39 pcmcia-cs would not
compile, the failure was in the debug section, with an undefined xxxCIS,
forgot the exact name. Oh well, it will all get sorted out eventually.
