Ooh, this seems familiar.  My configuration is very similar to the one
mentioned above (with Adaptec controller, driver is AIC7xxx) and I have
seem this problem of LILO hanging with RAID 0.90.  This was after the
'popper' got stuck in the R state as an unkillable process and 'kupdate'
and 'kswapd' were stuck in the D state.  I originally ran 2.2.17 with
stock RAID and the same thing happened with the 'popper' daemon there
although I did not try LILO that time.
Well, the machine with the problem is a production server and I have
reverted to 2.2.16 with RAID 0.90.  All is well there so far and,
hopefully, I can have the same stability as I had with 2.2.16 + stock
RAID.  I can't help with any further debugging but, both times the
'popper' and 'kupdate' got stuck, it was a result of a user with a large
mailbox connecting.  The 'popper' copies the mailbox over to a temporary
file on the same RAID partition (/var), so a guess would be this burst of
heavy I/O might be a trigger.  I would like to know if there is a patch to
fix this so I could reconsider upgrading from 2.2.16.
Thanks,
