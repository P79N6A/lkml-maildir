Hand waving? Dont think that was intensional though.. i think we are trying
to address a real problem, if there is a reasonable alternate already
that we are not aware of, no problemo...
1. Regarding process migration, someone needs to make sure they run
something like a taskset away from all the cpus that are planned to be
removed upfront. This needs to be done on all processes on the system.
[nick, is there an easier way to do this in today's sched infrastructure or
otherwise]
2. For interrrupt migration, today when we take a cpu offline, we pick 
a random online cpu today. So if you have a cpu going offline, and the 
next logical cpu is also part of the same package, or node, we have
no smarts today to keep migration away from those "to be offlined" cpus.
If we have a solution to these already, or a simpler alternative, we are
open to those... and iam getting help on large system validation.. it might
not be easy right away, but its comming.
