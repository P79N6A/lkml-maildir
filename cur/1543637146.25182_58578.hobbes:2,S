Problem is of getting completion status of this commands

Martin why aren't you telling people all facts?
It was the default behaviour before your change in IDE 99.
This patch in practice reverts IDE 99 change.
You have INTRODUCED a bug and now you try to
pretend that it wasn't your fault and it was somehow broken before.
Before 2.5.27 code had the same functionality as scsi version.
And yes it will be useful to move it to block layer.
