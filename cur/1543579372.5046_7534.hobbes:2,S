Yes!  This patch works wonderfully...  The mmapped sound is great, much
better than the ALSA drivers.  The patch also applies without a hitch to
2.4.0, since the driver hasn't been updated in a while (hope you feel
better soon, Jeff).  I haven't found any bugs, but my test of "see if it
runs quake3 and soldier of fortune without clipping or crashing" is far
from exhaustive.  I can definitely say that it's better than the ALSA
emulation of OSS, since there's no annoying mixing slowdown and
corresponding clipping.  Thanks!
