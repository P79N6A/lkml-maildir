Subject: PCMCIA for LC2420 with 2.6.0 kernel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I have a linux certified LC 2420 laptop with 1 GB of
memory running linux from scratch (LFS) 5.0 and I
recently moved to 2.6.0 kernel. I wanted to try a
Linksys WPC54G on linux using ndiswrapper to enable
wireless networking but I ran into a problem. PCMCIA
does not seem to work. I did not need PCMCIA before
this so I did not enable it in the previous kernels
(linux-2.4.*). I am using pcmcia-cs-3.2.7. When I
insert any card (I also tried Adaptec 1480A slimscsi)
I hear no beeps, the output of /var/log/sys.log does
not change and
cardctl status
says
Socket 0:
  no card
I know that there is no hardware problem because the
laptop is dual boot and on Windoze 2000 side, it says
new hardware found when I insert any card. Also the
power light comes on for WPC54G (does not happen for
linux).
If I look at dmesg, it looks like it detected the
Cardbus bridge:
Linux Kernel Card Services
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
Intel PCIC probe: not found.

I posted this on comp.os.linux.portable and David
Hinds 
replied:
"Note the memory address here of 0x3fff000: for some
reason, your bridge's registers were mapped to overlay
the top 4K of system memory.
I remember this sort of problem coming up before and
I'd thought it had been fixed.  Aparently not.  It is
sometimes caused by the BIOS erroneously reporting a
memory size a bit too small; you might check the
memory map information reported in your boot logs.
I don't know enough about the appropriate parts of the
kernel to suggest a fix, unfortunately.  You should
report the bug to the linux-kernel mailing list.  It
is a bug in PCI resource allocation."
The relevant lspci output is:
