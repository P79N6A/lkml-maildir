Well, when will 2.4 be available?
Right now we only have a CPiA-based camera driver
(with source code) and a Philips webcam driver
(binary only).  There may be some others in
progress, but I don't know of any.
See www.linux-usb.org for drivers & status.

what usb cams will be supported under linux with 2.4?
i mean, will kensington's cam be supported, and perhaps intel's?
I want to know so I can go ahead and buy one and use it for windows.
