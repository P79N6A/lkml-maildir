Right now we have two namespaces, user and system.  That's one bit of 
information, and the proposal is to represent it with 5-7 bytes, passing it 
on every call, and decoding it with a memcmp or similar.  This is just extra 
fluff as far as I can see, and provides every bit as much opportunity for 
implementing a private API as the original cmd parameter did, by encoding 
whatever one pleases before the dot.

I'm suggesting we take a look at that.

OK, well it looks like you're going a little overboard here in dividing out 
the functionality.  What you're talking about is 'follow symlink or not', 
right?  That really does sound to me as though it's naturally expressed with 
a flag bit.  I really don't see a compelling reason to go beyond 8 syscalls:
  get, fget, set, fset, del, fdel, list, flist
