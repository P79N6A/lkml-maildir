Hello,
I'm trying to run syncppp on Cobalt Qube2 boxen and it runs fine when I
build it as static (i.e., built-in to the kernel).
However, if I try to run it as a module ...
# gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux-2.0.34C52_SK/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -fno-strength-reduce -G 0
-mno-abicalls -fno-pic -mcpu=r8000 -mips2 -mmad -pipe -DMODULE  -c -o
syncppp.o syncppp.c
(no compilation errors)
# insmod syncppp.o

The kernel for the Cobalt Qube2 boxen is a Cobalt-crafted 2.0.34.
Does anybody have a clue on what could be the problem here???
Thanks in advance for your help.

Ivan
