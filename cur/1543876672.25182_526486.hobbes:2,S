512, not 256.  However, the reason would be because you have an 
application (which might actually be running on another system 
entirely!) which expects the other behaviour.

I think you're missing the whole point of console reset.  Its purpose is 
to force the console into a known-good state.  The fewer pieces of state 
it leaves unset, the better.  To some degree it's less important what 
that state actually is.
