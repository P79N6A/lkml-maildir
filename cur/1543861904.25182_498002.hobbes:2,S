I mean remove the kernel-internal dirty_ratio variable and use
/proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio as an accessor to `long vm_dirty_kb', with
appropriate conversions when /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio is written to and
read from.

Sounds complex.  Better, I think, to create (and recommend) vm_dirty_kb and
vm_dirty_background_kb and deprecate the old knobs.

A 16TB machine would overflow that int by default.
