Based on my understanding that the anti-tivoization provisions are
*the* objectionable issue about GPLv3 for those of you who dislike
GPLv3, this is circular reasoning:
  anti-tivoization is bad
  => we reject licenses with it
  => there are fewer developers willing to develop with such licenses
  => anti-tivoization is bad

I really don't know about that.  I can believe it may be so in LKML.

Wow, that's a really big sample among all Free Software and Open
Source developers out there.  And not even a little bit biased at
that.

Which is worse, not understanding or repeatedly snipping out and
addressing unrelated points?
Let's please try again.
I'll try to keep it simple, since you can't seem to be able to grasp
the entire argument, and keep disregarding essential parts, disputing
unrelated points and jumping to the conclusions that you've disputed
the point I was trying to make.
I'll present it in parts, as an attempt to stop you from making this
mistake, that I'm sure is not intentional.
The first part is in this e-mail.
Dispute this:
non-tivoized hardware => users can scratch their itches => more
contributions from these users
tivoized hardware => users can't scratch their itches => fewer
contributions from these users
