Its reproducible, I hoped it wouldn't happen again after a reboot, but 
unfortunately it did. Trying a newer kernel, hmm, usually a problem on server 
systems. I will try to test quotas on another amd64 system first(*).

(*) Which would be easy, if there wouldn't be a 64bit kernel, 32bit glibc, 
nfsclient inode truncation bug, which forces me to run all of our amd64 
nfsroot-clients with a 32bit kernel,

Well, my fault that I still didn't submit a glibc bug report.
