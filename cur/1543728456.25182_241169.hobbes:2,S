Part of standard verification of sender addresses. You're being offered
an email.... if you can't send a bounce to the address it claims to come
from, or if you can't send a mail to postmaster at the same domain, then
the chances that the mail you're being offered is a fake are high enough
to warrant rejecting it.
Results are cached for a period of time -- the _first_ rejection should
have been more explicit than 'result of earlier verification reused' --
it should have actually given you the results of trying to send that
mail to postmaster@pinerecords.com:
	rcpt to:<postmaster@pinerecords.com>
	553 5.3.0 <postmaster@pinerecords.com>... No such user
