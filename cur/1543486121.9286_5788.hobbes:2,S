Specifically "ADJ_OFFSET_SINGLESHOT" does no longer exist. It's 
"ADJ_ADJTIME" now, because it really does an adjtime(). Of course 
glibc can hide it. The reason for the change is: The old bitmask had 
two bits set while the new one only has a single bit. This allows a 
different test. If you don't look at the code closely, you might 
break something. When the old name is gone, you'll have too look at 
the places where it was used.
