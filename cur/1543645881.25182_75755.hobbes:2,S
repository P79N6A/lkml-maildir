Subject: [PATCH] Bodge up serial support in 2.5.40
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Standard 8250/16550 UART support is broken in 2.5.40, and I needed it, so following a bit of advice from Russell King, I've prepared this patch.
I thought I'd post it, just incase anybody else out there actually uses serial ports, (seems they don't).  Before you apply it, bear in mind that the last C I did was a hello world program :-), (only half kidding).
This is a bodge up patch only, NOT an official solution.
John.
