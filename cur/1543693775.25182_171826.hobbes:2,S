That's different. That's just preheating the page cache.
It does nothing for the case Joel mentioned where 2 different nodes
are writing to the same device, and you need to force a read in order
to resynchronize the page cache.
Apart from O_DIRECT, we have nothing in the kernel as it stands that
will allow userland to deal with this case.
