See that "preempt" in line 2 . Linux does not
preempt kernel mode processes otherwise. The beauty of the
non-preemptive kernel is that "in K mode every process makes progress"
and even the "niced app" will complete its use of SemA and 
release it in one run. If you have a reasonably fair scheduler you
can make very useful analysis with Linux now of the form
	Under 50 active proceses in the system means that in every
	2 second interval every process
	will get at least 10ms of time to run.
That's a very valuable property and it goes away in a preemptive kernel 
to get you something vague.

So your argument is that I'm advocating Andrew Morton's patch which 
reduces latencies more than the preempt patch because I have a
financial interest in not reducing latencies? Subtle.
In any case, motive has no bearing on a technical argument. 
Your motive could be to make the 68K look better by reducing 
performance on other processors for all I know.
