Hi
A couple of times, I've had a mildly irritating problem with mounted
smb shares where the machine supplying the share isn't available after
the mount has taken place. I'm not entirely sure where the problem
lies, so this seems as good a place as any to mention it.
I run VMWare for mail and online banking and I often mount the VMWare
Win98 virtual disk using Samba to transfer files. If VMWare crashes,
or X crashes, or I simply shutdown VMWare without unmounting the smb
share from Linux, then reboot my machine (running RedHat 6.0 with a
2.2.10 kernel), it gets to the stage of unmounting filesystems
(specifically the smb shares) and just hangs. I've left it for up to
10 minutes to see if it would time out, but it seems to be waiting
indefinitely. It's quite irritating because the main partitions have
not yet been unmounted, so when I am forced to hard reset, fsck checks
the partitions (as they have been uncleanly unmounted). On 15Gb of
partitions, this takes quite a while!
Is it something I'm doing wrong with my setup, or is it a fixable bug?
