/dev/console is a virtual terminal just like /dev/tty*. It really
has nothing to do with "printk" in the kernel (really). It's
just one of the many places where things "printed" in the kernel
can be displayed.
And, yes, the console is a two-way terminal emulator. It is the
standard-input, standard-output, and standard-error, for the
init process. Normally init doesn't respond to any input from
the console, but during boot it does so that you can try to
fix various errors.
