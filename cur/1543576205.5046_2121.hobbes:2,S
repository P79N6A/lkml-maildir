Tigran, you write:

If I could add one thing here (we have had a 2.2 patch like this for testing
with ext3) - if you specify the rootfstype parameter don't use the "quiet"
option to read_super, so you know why it couldn't mount a specific filesystem
as root, and/or print rootfs type in the panic message.
This is especially useful if you have something in LILO that you forgot about...
Cheers, Andreas
