No, you don't understand.  It has nothing to do with permissions
to the actual file /dev/stdin refers to, be it a tty or something
else.
In the exact same situation, I don't have to do anything with
/dev/tty (which refers to the same tty at the end) - it
Just Works (tm).  Ditto on Solaris for example, --
/dev/stdin etc Just Works too.  But not on Linux.
Without digging into implementation details (in this case it's
the fact that /dev/stdin in linux is implemented using a symlink
to - f.e. - /dev/tty/0 etc), I expect /dev/stdin to always work
as far as filedescriptor 0 is open, regardless of any permissions
on the actual tty (if it's a tty in the first place, which is
not necessary the case) -- exactly the same as /dev/tty works.
It's more:  I can redirect stdout of a process to some file,
and at that point /dev/stdout will return ENOENT on open.
The question is:
Are /dev/stdin &Co on linux are just convenience symlinks to
know where your std* files are (if so, why they're in /dev
and why they're so INconvenient - so many levels of symlinks), --
ie, the only thing I can do with them is ls/readlink them,
or are they supposed to actually WORK, ie, I'm able to open
them, as on other systems?
Thanks.
