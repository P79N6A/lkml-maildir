Subject: [PATCH] Define a NO_GPIO macro to compare against and to use as an invalid GPIO
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/31/235

As discussed on i2c mailing list with David Brownell, and number
outside of the 0...MAX_INT range is invalid as a GPIO number.
Define a macro, similar to NO_IRQ, to be used as a deliberate
invalid GPIO, rather than defining a is_valid_gpio() macro.
