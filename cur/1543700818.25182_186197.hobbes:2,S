It's an IBM Japanese keyboard which emulates a U.S. one.  Andries has
quite a bit of information about it on his page, but the interesting
thing is that it doesn't do any emulation in set 3, only in the
default set 2.  The ID is ab90.  There may be ab90 ID keyboards out
there which are not set 3 compatible, I don't know.  Mine is certainly
not fully usable in set 2, though, as the language keys produce the
same codes as the space bar.
