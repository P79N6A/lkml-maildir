Why do we have that stupid "hose" name? Only because of strange alpha 
naming, or did somebody else also use that incredibly silly name?
Please talk about "domains", at least it makes some sense as a name.
I'm also hoping that /proc/bus will eventually go away, so I don't see a 
major problem with not understanding multiple domains at that level.
On a /sys/bus/xxx level we actually should already be able to handle 
multiple domains, but the naming is broken. However, in /sys we should be 
able to nicely handling non-zero domains by just extending the name space 
a bit.
