What looks like a promising idea for this problem and others is to
have visible and invisible inodes.  All current filesystems know only
visible inodes.  Invisible ones have no dentry linking to them
directly, only indirectly through files/links with cow semantics.
Ok, when the underlying filesystem is rw, each file linked from the
caching fs has to be broken up into visible and invisible inodes.  The
visible link from both filesystems is to the invisible inode and
writes to either one have to cow.
Three or more filesystems?  No problem, same as above.
Mixed ro and rw?  No problem, same as above.
Files "showing through"?  Doesn't happen if you do the equivalent of
"cp -l" - directories are copied, files are linked.
Solves all of your problems so far.  Do you have more?

Yeah, maybe.  My personal consensus right now is that this actually
looks very simple.  Not sure how much time I will find, but it should
definitely be finished for 2.8.
