i've released the -S5 VP patch:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc2-mm3-S5
this iteration fixes the jackd lockup reported by Rui Nuno Capela.
since Andrew has not released -mm3 yet i've uploaded his latest
intermediate tree plus two additional fixes that will likely show up in
the real -mm3, and unrolled some of the more experimental scheduler
stuff. The patching order is:
