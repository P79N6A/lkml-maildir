  I guess disabling fsync() was already commented on enough. Regarding
switching to writeback mode on per-process basis - not easily possible
because sometimes data is not written out by the process which stored
them (think of mmaped file). And in case of DB, they use direct-io
anyway most of the time so they don't care about journaling mode anyway.
  But as Diego wrote, there is definitely some room for improvement in
current data=ordered mode so the difference shouldn't be as big in the
end.
