Oh, really? RTFM on use of AF_UNIX for passing file descriptors. Notice
that there's nobody to associate them with if sender had closed the fd
after sendmsg(). They are in flight - pointers to struct file stored in
SCM_RIGHTS packet that hangs in receiving queue of a socket. Like hell
you'll see them in procfs or in fuser output. About the only thing you can
do is to start killing everything with receiving AF_UNIX socket. And
looking which kill will result in space getting freed. Great. Especially
since you'll have to figure out which space increase came from _that_ and
which was the result of the fscker finally leaving the old version of
libfoobar.so to die. And which was the result of postponed activity - if
we'll get s-u expect it big way.
