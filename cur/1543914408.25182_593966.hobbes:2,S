Ah, ok, I shall look to your patches in more detail, it was not obvious
from the formulae you posted.

I'm missing context here, are you referring to the nice level error or
the avg approximation?

Right, I've build user-space simulators too, handy little things to play
with :-)

I've not yet seen it go spectacularly wrong, although admittedly a
highly concurrent kbuild is the most complex task I let loose on it.
Could you perhaps be more specific on the circumstances it breaks down
and what the negative impact is?
