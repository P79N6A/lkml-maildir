yes, i already did so, i think:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=109979092216919&w=2
but i did it this way:
 bk clone -r1.2000.7.1 linux-2.6-BK linux-2.6-BK-test
 bk undo -a1.2010
(probably wrong, so i'll repeat it as you suggeseted)

really: i always do "make clean", even "make mrproper" sometimes, just
to be sure. and i am quite certain, that i did not forget to install the
modules. but i'll keep my eyes open, yes.

i'm updating via "ntpdate" on every boot. i am even using a (faster) 2nd
machine for my build and the bk things right now: building a current -bk
on boths hosts gives me this error.

i'll build a -bk snapshot from a tar.bz2 later on and see what it gives.
