Hi,
I wondered if regular truncate() and read() might have the same
problem, so I tested again and again.
And I realized it will occur on any local filesystems.
Sometime I could get partly zero filled data instead of file contents.
I analysis this situation, read systemcall doesn't lock anything
 -- no page lock, no semaphore lock --  while someone truncates
files partially. 
It will often happens in case of pagefault in copy_user() to
copy file data to user space.
I guess if needed, it should be fixed in VFS.

Thank you,
