A lot of the apparently really ugly drivers turned out to be very good code
hiding under 10 years of history and core code changes and
assumptions. See the NCR5380 stuff I've now all done (in 2.4.18pre) - dont 
use 2.5.* NCR5380 it'll probably corrupt your system if it doesn't just die
or hang - Linus apparently merged untested stuff to the old broken driver.
