Hearing all this talk about initramfs and eliminating hardwired
drivers, it occurs to me to ask:
Can/will the initramfs mechanism be made to implicitly load into the
kernel the modules (or some of the modules) in the image?
Doing so would allow the initramfs image to be composed solely of the
modules to be loaded, which would reduce the need for the "klibc".  It
would also eliminate the need for any sort of control script to be in
the image.
The only difficulty that I perceive in doing this is that the modules
in question might need to be appropriately resolved and relocated
before being put into the file image.  I think this is a solvable
problem, given that the kernel and its System.map should be available
when building the image.
