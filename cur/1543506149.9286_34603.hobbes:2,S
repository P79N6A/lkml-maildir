I don't see the problem with 53C8xx controllers referenced. Here's the
message from some time ago to refresh your memory:

FYI this problem is still there in 2.2.11 (and in patch-2.2.12pre7);
I tripped over this last night. Do you still have those patches queued?
As stated in that thread, copying over the old core_*.[ch] from an older
2.2.x kernel (I tried 2.2.5) fixes the symptom perfectly. Maybe not the
optimal solution, but at least it my system then has a usable scsi
controller again...
