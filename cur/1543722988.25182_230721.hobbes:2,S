Hi,
 same problems as reported for -mm1 and -mm2
a) Boot option "nolapic" does not work on my Omnibook 6100 when
LOCAL_APIC is enabled on configuration. Hangs computing BogoMips. Works
in 2.6.7, 2.6.7-bk and 2.6.6-mm. Workarounds: "acpi=off" with no other
boot options, or not enabling LOCAL_APIC in .config.
b) Shutdown/reboot hangs unloading ISDN subsystem. Using SYSRQ-E needed
to finish shutdown. This may actually be more a 2.6.7 thing, as I have
seen it "once" in 2.6.7-vanilla. 
 Config attached.
Martin
