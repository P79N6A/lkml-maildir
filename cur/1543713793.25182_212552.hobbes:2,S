Well it would be nice to keep it fast though, especially
for big masks like those 64 byte cpumasks of yours. In
the scheduler for example, a lot of balancing operations
are done with very sparse cpumasks, which your bit at a
time version doesn't handle very well.
For example, a global CPU balancing operation on a 512
CPU system with 2 CPUs per node currently does 256
for_each_cpu loops over cpumasks with two entries in
them. 130 thousand test_bit loop iteratinos.
The uninlined larger version would have to be smaller and
faster than your small version inlined, wouldn't it?
