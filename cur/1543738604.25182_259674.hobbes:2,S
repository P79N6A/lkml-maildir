Manfred,
This patch seems to work fine on my AMD machine.
I tested your patch on 2.6.9-rc2-mm3. 
It seemed to have fixed fragmentation problem I was
observing, but I don't think it fixed the problem
completely. I still see some fragmentation, with
repeated tests of scsi-debug, but it could be due
to the test. I will collect more numbers..
Thanks,
Badari
