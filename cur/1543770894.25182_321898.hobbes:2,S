Have you tried loading and using some of these modules with older -RT 
kernels? If they have been using init_MUTEX_LOCKED on RT semaphores, 
they should have BUG & Oops. Recent -RT kernels have added extra check 
for this during linking. The fact that you are prevented from building 
these modules is a Good Thing(TM).
Maybe these drivers should be using completions instead of semaphores.
A quick fix would be changing the 'struct semaphore' to 'struct 
compat_semaphore'.
