   I don't think Lindent does everything 100% correct; at least its
   formatting of switch/case does look a little fishy:
   	switch (option) {
   	case 1: 
   		/* blaha */
   
   That feels kind of odd compared to the rest of the codingstyle.
That actually looks right to me.  Look for switch statements
in the TCP code, they are layed out like that.
