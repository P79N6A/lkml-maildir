With the rather painful exception of disk IO.  Try copying a file from
a floppy while doing anything else and you'll see how painful it is.  This
wasn't fixed in 95 either (probably not 98 - who knows about NT).
Under OS/2, system responsiveness improved under heavy disk access,
but under Windows it freezes the system entirely.
