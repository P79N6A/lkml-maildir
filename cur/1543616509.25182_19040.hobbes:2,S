  Alan mentioned that some cards make use of multiple codecs,
but also consider those of us that have multiple sound
cards when forming the '/proc' pathname.  As a quick&dirty
hack to allow two 1371 cards to co-exist in /proc, I added
the upper 8 bits of the address into the filename...
  (One sound card dedicated to being used as a 1200 baud
   modem for AX25 work, leaving one free for use as a
   normal soundcard)
