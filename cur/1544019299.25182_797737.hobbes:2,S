Right.

Two 64 bit fields have to be added for time stamps plus 3 bits for flags
(for time stamping instructions, currently in skb_shared_tx).
Putting that into shinfo should work fine. I thought extending that
structure with information that isn't needed for all packets was as bad
as extending sk_buff itself. If that isn't the case, then extending
shinfo definitely is the simplest solution.
