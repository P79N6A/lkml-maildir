I suppose for applications that do only streaming I/O (and gs is one of those)
this O_LARGEFILE fix shouldn't cause any problem.  Any applications which do
seeking, or otherwise use/store the file offset for any reason will likely
break.  However, since they are still using the 32-bit syscalls, they will
likely just get EOVERFLOW and not die horribly (assuming they check the
return code).
Cheers, Andreas
