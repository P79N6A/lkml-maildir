Correct.
All acceses to shared data that could be interrupted _must_ be protected by
a locked section.
IMVHO the Intel behaviour is correct due to the fact that if more than one
task write to the same location
without protect it with a lock, it means that 1) the order of writes is
meaningless 2) we know that no more than
one task in a given time access the location.
