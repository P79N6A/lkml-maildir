CD blanking only takes "one" command for the whole operation, as 
e.g. compared to CD writing where you always have to push out data packets.
Why I think it's just one (note the quotes): You can interrupt/kill 
cdrecord in the midst of blanking a CD, and blanking will continue to the 
'end' (either fast blank or full blank, whichever was sent)
As mentioned some time earlier, I had similar, but not the same issues. I 
could continue accessing the harddrive - otherwise mplayer would have 
stopped immediately, but it played at least until EOF.
