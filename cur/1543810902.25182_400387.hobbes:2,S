I was to suggest the same thing originally, but on several boxes I checked
there weren't any special MTRRs < 1MB, only in the PCI memory hole
<4GB. I suspect there isn't just any interesting hardware in 640K anymore.
BTW I have been also pondering some time to really trust e820 and not
forcibly reserve 640K-1MB on 64bit.  That code was inherited from i386,
but probably never made too much sense
[I remember actually taking it out very early, but then putting
it back when I was hunting some insidious unrelated bug. But it wasn't that]
Perhaps that would be a good idea to ignore that newer i386 systems too 
(newer defined as having DMI BIOS dates >2000 or so)
