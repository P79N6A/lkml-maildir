This is a much slighter misunderstanding. The result of the 'select'
function tells you nothing about what a particular 'read' will or will not
do. It's just a status reporting function. Saying that 'select' tells you 'a
read will not block' is as misleading as saying 'access' tells you if an
'open' will succeed.
All status reporting functions report status. You can phrase this about what
a hypothetical concurrent operation *would* *have* done. But it is
misleading to phrase it as what an actual future operation *will* do. The
kernel does not predict the future.
