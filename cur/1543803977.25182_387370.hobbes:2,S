Hi all,
i am having some problem in having root file system on NFS,
i am developing a linux embedded system,. when i have a root file
system on a NFS and i try to boot the kernel through a repeater hub ,
then the kernel hangs at freeing init memory.
 if i connect the board with the PC through a cross cable,
then the system works ok.
does anybody has some idea about it
