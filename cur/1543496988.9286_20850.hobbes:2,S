Hello,
I don't know where else to turn, so I'm sending it here.
I am not on this list (do search the mail archives regularly though),
so please send any replies cc to me.
I have an nfs home directory server with:
GDT2658RD SCSI raid controller (firmware rev 2.22.05-R019) with
4 IBM DGHS18V (18 G) HDs,
single PII processor,
kernel v 2.2.9 with kernel nfsd, quota and MTTR support.
Here is the message I get on the console:
"lookup_by_inode: ino 2315449 not found in cardnet
find_fh_dentry: <time>, 2315442/2315449 not found -- need full search"
Where cardnet is a directory on the home filesystem
(10G on a 30G partition).
The message can also come from the smbd, but there's nothing
in it's logs to refer to that.
Best regards,
     Nico Augustijn.
