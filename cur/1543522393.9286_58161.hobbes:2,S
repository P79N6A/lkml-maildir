I noticed this in pre-patch-2.3.40-4.gz:
        /* Stay within the limit we were given */
-       timeout = tp->ato;
+       timeout = (tp->ato << 1) >> 1;
        if (timeout > max_timeout)
                timeout = max_timeout;
What is the point of this?
   - If tp->ato has bit 31 set, then the effect depends on the width of `int'.
     (Because all arithmetic operations in C extend to `int' width first).
   - If tp->ato is bit 31 clear, this has no effect.
If the intention is to clear bit 31, `&= 0x7fffffff' is the thing which
works and is probably more efficient.
Enjoy,
