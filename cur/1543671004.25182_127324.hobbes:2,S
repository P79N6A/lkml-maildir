At this time, I have compiled and installed a 2.4.20-ac2 + some cobalt
patches. Is the bug also fixed in 2.4.20-ac2, or must I rebuild the
2.4.20 with the check commented out ?
(currently, the sync of the partition is in the way with the ac2
kernel... just started... need about 100 minutes to finish...).
I will comment out the check tomorrow if this is needed.
Thanks for your help, and keep up the good work.
