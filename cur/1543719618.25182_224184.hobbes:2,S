The atkbd.c driver does exactly that. It hides the fact that there is a
special scancode for the PrintScreen key, if you press it together with
some other keys.
There is no special scancode on any other keyboard type for it,
including PS/2 keyboards in their native Set3 mode.
It's a hack by IBM engineers, the PC/XT keyboard had a SysRq key, the
PC/AT keyboard did not, yet some old DOS programs needed it, so they
made the AT keyboard generate the keycode for alt-sysrq when running in
XT compatibility mode.
Unfortunately, the XT compatibility mode stuck, and that's what we're
using now.

The kernel works with real keys. There is no real sysrq key. My
definition of sanity is to base your thinking on reality where possible.

Ok, it's probably a bad name for it, it should have been named
KEY_PRTSCR, but it wasn't, and it'd only cause breakage now to change
it.

Because there is only one key.
