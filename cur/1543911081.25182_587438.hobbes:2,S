Then you do this check only if the instruction crosses a page.
That is very cheap to test.

Most systems probably have gaps between user and supervisor
(like Linux), but ok.

You're proposing instead to paravirtualize all drivers, even if 99.99%
of those will never ever have a driver model.

I still think it's preferable to change some drivers than everybody.
AFAIK BusLogic as real hardware is pretty much dead anyways,
so you're probably the only primary user of it anyways.
Go wild on it!
If you worry about it do your own drivers like the other hypervisors.
I still suspect you could go faster if you use a paravirtualy
optimized driver, but and I'm not going to speculate on the 
reasons why you don't want to do that.

You wouldn't need to change it; just add a very simple new one
(e.g. the lguest interface is nearly trivial)

Well that might be. I just think it would be a mistake
to design paravirt_ops based on someone's short term release engineering
considerations.

That would be a cool project anyways. e.g. just moving 
the NUMAQ support separately would clean it up. But probably not enough
on its own, sorry.
But you'll need separate interfaces anyways if you want to
go down the BusLogic change path. That could well be coupled
with a cleanup.

I thought we had that already?  But can't find it now :/

You want to do what exactly? 
If you mean PAE and non PAE In the same binary: that would likely
need abstracted page tables first.
