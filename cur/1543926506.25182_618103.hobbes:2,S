This can already be set via all.config/allmod.config.
Where is this need coming from? The point is that I don't like to add an 
interface, which is maybe used by two people, who should be perfectly 
capable using an existing superior mechanism.

I showed you a solution, which requires no patch at all, while your patch 
adds extra functionality which is questionable.
Why is a quick hack preferable over a proper solution? 
Either explain why my solution isn't usable or _please_ revert the K64BIT 
changes.

The other function doesn't complain about it either. There is already 
only limited error checking, e.g. there is no complaint that the value 
isn't really set (because it was selected by something else), otherwise 
the .config check during a kernel upgrades would be a lot noisier than it 
already is. Anyone directly editing .config should know what he is doing.
