Only realistic if the list of systems needing a quirk is small. Do you
think that would be the case?

We even have two solutions, but both have drawbacks.
The AML lock solution has performance issue. It could be improved with a
better semaphore primitive, but that needs to be implemented first. It
also requires to modify all drivers ACPI might conflict with, and
that's a rather long list.
Rudolf Marek's port forwarding idea should perform better, and might
also be useful for other problems than ACPI vs. regular drivers,
however it makes resources bigger, and requires to modify the same long
list of drivers, and with specific code for every driver. I'm not sure
that it will be possible for all driver in practice, as this more or
less requires to forecast the I/O access pattern of ACPI.

We can protect the additional driver code with #ifdef CONFIG_ACPI, as I
did in my proof-of-concept. Not particularly elegant, granted, but it
should work.
If something cleaner can be done, I'm all for it. Could you please
propose an implementation of your idea? It doesn't need to be perfect,
but I would like to see what it would look like.

Yes, there are several other systems out there which are known to be
affected by the problem. And probably many others where ACPI access I/O
ports reserved by regular drivers and we are simply lucky that nothing
bad happens. My desktop system has such a motherboard (Jetway K8M8MS).
But SMP alternatives are becoming more popular, so we might start
seeing more problems in practice in a near future.
