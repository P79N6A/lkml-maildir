Oups, sorry: 
Linux shrek 2.4.13-ac7 #6 SMP Son Dez 2 20:02:04 CET 2001 i686 unknown
(on patches, IIRC)

Shouldn't the client invalidate the dcache entry some time?
Now, 5 hours later, the dcache entry isn't invalidated, yet.
I think, this is a thinko. I'm not familiar with nfs internals,
but have done stuff like this before (anybody remember BioNet?).
Please try this:
shrek is the server, elfe the client
/raid is shared (reiserfs, no raid), /tmp isn't
shrek:/raid/tmp# touch /tmp/huhu
shrek:/raid/tmp# ln -s /tmp/huhu
shrek:/raid/tmp# l
total 1
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root           55 Jan 11 20:07 ./
drwxr-xr-x    9 root     root          218 Jan 11 20:06 ../
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            9 Jan 11 20:07 huhu -> /tmp/huhu
elfe:/raid/tmp# echo "huhu" > /tmp/huhu
elfe:/raid/tmp# l
insgesamt 1
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root           55 11. Jan 20:07 ./
drwxr-xr-x    9 root     root          218 11. Jan 20:06 ../
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            9 11. Jan 20:07 huhu -> /tmp/huhu
elfe:/raid/tmp# cat huhu 
huhu
shrek:/raid/tmp# rm huhu
elfe:/raid/tmp# l
insgesamt 1
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root           35 11. Jan 20:07 ./
drwxr-xr-x    9 root     root          218 11. Jan 20:06 ../
elfe:/raid/tmp# touch huhu
elfe:/raid/tmp# l
ls: huhu: Eingabe-/Ausgabefehler

Pretty simple. Can you reproduce this?

Not sure.
