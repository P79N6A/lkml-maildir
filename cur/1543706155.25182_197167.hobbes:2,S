Thanks, you're right!
I checked the other drivers, and zorro8390.c has the same problem with
zorro8390_init(). I'll fix them and will resend after 2.6.3.
BTW, while verifying the rules w.r.t. the various __*it markers, I stumbled
across this in Documentation/pci.txt (while it's not really PCI-related):
| Tips:
|         The module_init()/module_exit() functions (and all initialization
|         functions called only from these) should be marked __init/exit.
|         The struct pci_driver shouldn't be marked with any of these tags.
|         The ID table array should be marked __devinitdata.
|         The probe() and remove() functions (and all initialization
|         functions called only from these) should be marked __devinit/exit.
|         If you are sure the driver is not a hotplug driver then use only
|         __init/exit __initdata/exitdata.
|
|         Pointers to functions marked as __devexit must be created using
|         __devexit_p(function_name).  That will generate the function
|         name or NULL if the __devexit function will be discarded.
But a quick look shows that very few drivers seem to mark their ID table array
__devinitdata...
