Subject: [PATCH 0/2] faking and fixing the NUMA SLIT

The problem with NUMA distances in the SLIT is that they are often wrong, oh 
wait they aren't there at all because the BIOS didn't create a SLIT since 
Windows does not use it.  If Linux does not find a slit it just says the 
distance to local=10 and remote=20 according to ACPI spec.  The problem is 
when we have a 4P system (or larger), there is generally one node where we 
have two hops and its distance should be >20.
Following are patches to first fake the SLIT in the ACPI code and then add 
ability to write the distances from sysfs.
