Yeah, this module is unfortunately not under the GPL, it was made for research and i am not the author, I was only given the code for my own research.
I enabled that support in the kernel, and then tried to recompile and get tons of errors/warnings... so maybe I am missing something else to be enabled in the kernel... here are a few examples of errors:
/usr/include/linux/skbuff.h:30:26: net/checksum.h: No such file or directory
/usr/include/asm/irq.h:16:25: irq_vectors.h: No such file or directory
/usr/include/linux/irq.h:72: error: `NR_IRQS' undeclared here (not in a function)
/usr/include/asm/hw_irq.h:28: error: `NR_IRQ_VECTORS' undeclared here (not in a function)
I think those are the top most errors, so if i can fix those hopefully the rest shall vanish!
