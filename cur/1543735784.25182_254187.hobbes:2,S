Here is round-two for the Pacific Digital QStor SATA/RAID driver.
Most of the original concerns have been addressed,
and a few bugs fixed in the interim.
This driver does not share code (yet) with libata, due to the
difficulty of doing so at present -- the vendor wants the same
source code to be usable (eventually) on early 2.4.xx kernels
which lack libata, and much of the existing libata code requires
libata-specific data structures.  We'll work on that later.
New in this version is a scsi_worker_thread, used to feed drive
hotplug events back to the mid-layer.  During testing we discovered
that this is very unsafe to do from "normal" driver context,
since the mid-layer promptly calls back into the driver in the
same context, causing all kinds of locking issues and whatnot.
Feedback is appreciated, but please keep it civil, guys!
Cheers
