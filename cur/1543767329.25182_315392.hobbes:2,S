How does that help?  It doesn't matter _which_ process you try to bind
mount /proc/XXX/fd/N from, the result will be the same.

As someone pointed out, CAP_SYS_ADMIN processes can already escape the
chroot jail with CLONE_NEWNS.  (fd=open("."); clone(CLONE_NEWNS);
[child:] fchdir(fd); chdir(".."))

Dunno.  It's a big change possibly breaking existing applications.
Chroot probably has other uses than jailing.

Yes.
