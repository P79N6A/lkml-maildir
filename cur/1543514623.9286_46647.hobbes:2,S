I think I have read something about how to boot from a raid5 set somewhere
on the net, but I don't remember where. It is relativly straightforward
anyway. Create a temporary root and install to it somewhere. Then you
create a normal raid5 set with a persistant superblock etc just like the
documentation in raidtools-0.90 says. Copy the old root to the new raid5
root, modify your /etc/lilo.conf and fixup your initrd if you use one. (On
RedHat you can use mkinitrd which will pick up the raid modules if you
have them in /etc/fstab+/etc/mdtab). 
You have to have a separate /boot or whatever you call the storage for the
actual kernel. Lilo cannot load the kernel from a raiddevice AFAIK.
If you get stuck feel free to send me a mail. I have set up a few
computers this way. I think there may be some failure modes that are
harder to get out of if you have your root on a raid5 device.
