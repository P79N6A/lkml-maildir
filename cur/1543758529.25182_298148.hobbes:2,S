Yeah, it is dbt3-pgsql on OSDL's 8-way STP machines. I think they're
PIII Xeons with 2MB L2 cache.
I had been having some difficulty running them recently, but I might
have just worked out what the problem was, so hopefully I can benchmark
the patchset I just sent to Andrew (plus fixes from Ingo, etc).
Basically what would happen is that with seemingly small changes, the
"throughput" figure would go from about 260 tps to under 100. I don't
know exactly why this benchmark is particularly sensitive to the
problem, but it has been a good canary for too-much-idle-time
regressions in the past.

I think this could become a scalability problem... and I'd prefer to
initially try to address problems of too much idle time by tuning them
out rather than use things like wake-to-idle-cpu.
One of my main problems with wake to idle is that it is explicitly
introducing a bias so that wakers repel their wakees. With all else
being equal, we want exactly the opposite effect (hence all the affine
wakeups and wake balancing stuff).
The regular periodic balancing may be dumb, but at least it doesn't
have that kind of bias.
The other thing of course is that we want to reduce internode task
movement at almost all costs, and the periodic balancer can be very
careful about this - something more difficult for wake_idle unless
we introduce more complexity there (a very time critical path).
Anyway, I'm not saying no to anything at this stage... let's just see
how we go.

That may end up being what we have to do. Probably doesn't make
much sense to do it at all if we aren't doing it for NUMA.
