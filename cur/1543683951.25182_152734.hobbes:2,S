Try libleds (hastily written just now ;-)) from
http://csgsoft.doc.ic.ac.uk/leds
 -- it should make the LED component of
those programs dead easy to write, and also protect you against any
changes anyone ever makes to the ioctls.
I guess you could also port libleds to some other system, but why would
you want to use anything other than linux?
There's no real documentation as yet, but the code is complete.  sample
usage:
#include <libleds/libleds.h>
.
.
.
led_t myled;
char ledstatus;
if (reserve_led(&myled) !=0) /* You should similarly check the rc from
the other fns, but I shan't bother here */
{
  perror ("Tried to reserve a LED");
  exit (EXIT_FAILURE);
}
led_status (myled, &status);
/* status is now nonzero if LED is on, zero if off */
status = !status;
led_set (myled, status);
/* Just toggled it */
release_led (myled);
/* SIGSEGV comes to those who use a led_t after release_led */
V1.1 will have a man page.  Woohoo.

Why reinvent the wheel?                 Because we can make it rounder...
