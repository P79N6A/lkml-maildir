As you Linus discovered last month, the WRITEA operations forget to
restore the BH_Dirty bit while giving up due out of request-slots (and
doing that it will almost sure trigger bad fs corruption).
So here it is the fix against 2.3.13-pre8:

Long ago I also noticed that the pagein/pageout stats (the one in vmstat
bi/bo fields) was accounting a failed (due out of request slots)
operation as a real write/read operation. This looks a bug to me so here
it is the fix incremental with the previous patch:
