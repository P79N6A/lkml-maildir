Most Google hits are about abortion.
The fact that people use this term in some completely different 
context does not give it the meaning you implied it had.
Oh, and this right of choice also does not exist in Poland...

And I'm trying to explain why your personal opinion is wrong in many 
cases.

There's nothing forbiding this, it's simply the question what results in 
a better kernel (see below).

Let's leave the theory.
As one of the most active code removers in the kernel [1], I can tell 
you what actually happens in practice:
Given:
- two choices A and B
- user tried choice A and it has a problem (e.g. doesn't work or has
  bad performance)
What happens:
- if choice B works, user uses choice B
What happens without choice B:
- user reports the problem and choice A gets fixed
It's always surprising how many people complain when you deprecate or 
remove a choice B that choice A wouldn't work for them, and who had 
never reported their problems before since choice B worked for them...
