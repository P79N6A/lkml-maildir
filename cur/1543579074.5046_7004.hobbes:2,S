What I'm talking about is that whenever you have these flag day(*) type of
operations, is weakens the whole Linux movement.  Yes, each individual change
might mean a few minutes to half an hour of a persons time, but cumulatively it
just sends the signal that Linux is just a hackers toy.  If people can't easily
switch between kernels for instance due to the wrong disk being listed as the
boot disk, or they have to replug which ethernet controller gets which cord, it
will mean fewer people testing new kernels for instance.
