Get a decent distribution. :)

2.4.20-benh1 doesn't know about this version of the cpu.

Strange. Either the kernel couldn't find the allowed frequencies for
scaling or the cpu doesn't support it.

152 is nothing....

This is not normal. Since the kernel doesn't know either the usable
frequencies, your version of the cpu and no doze mode is available
for this type, your energy savings are almost nil at the moment and this
should definitely be rectified. I cannot imagine Apple built a CPU into
a PowerBook which doesn't support some kind of throttling, because it
would kill their statement under their OS, too.
Unfortunately I'll have a whole bunch of nasty tests the following week
and thus cannot check back with the manuals at the moment; feel free to
send me a reminder in a week or so.
