When a massive buffer flush on my P3-500MHz, 1GB RAM server hits,
it slows down every NFS client and even the server's system console
to a crawl for 15-60 seconds.
When this happens, the ICP Vortex's GDT Monitor program shows it
being fed a constant write (e.g., it's buffers are 30-60% full
consistently).  Yet, "top" still reports 95%+ idle.
I cannot figure out what the culprit is.  One concern is the fact
that RedHat still ships with bdflush-1.5 and Caldera ships with
bdflush-1.62.  And someone mentioned that bdflush has now been
replaced by kflushd (in the kernel?).  I have kflushd, kupdate and
kswap all showing up in my ps/top list.  /sbin/update reports that
it is from bdflush 1.4, although I have installed the 1.5 RPM.
Otherwise, I am trying to figure out how I can "tune" the cache
system to better accomodate the system.  Right now, the system just
caches forever and writes extremely infrequently as far as I can
tell.
Again, any help at this point would be greatly appreciated.  But I
cannot attempt "trail'n error" since it is a production system.
NFS v2 and just the load itself could be other culprits.  But I
need some serious proof and understanding here.  I'm just not
finding out what it is.  What tools should I be using to find out?
Thanx, and sorry, I'm totally lost here.
