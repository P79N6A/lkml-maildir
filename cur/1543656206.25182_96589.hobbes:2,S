Same here.  I was getting bit on a Xircom card:
03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Xircom Cardbus Ethernet 10/100 (rev 03)
03:00.1 Serial controller: Xircom Cardbus Ethernet + 56k Modem (rev 03)
Dave has a point about not poking IRQ's before it's initialized, so I think
I'll let him and Alan discuss the *right* way to fix it. (Though if there's
need to test a patch more elegant/correct than mine, I'm more than happy to
do so...)
