I tested an earlier version of this patch on my i386 system with
PCI Express hot-plug slots.  The i386 acpiphp functionality worked
fine - i.e. I was able to do hot-plug of single- & multi-function 
cards.  
I'll check this new patch on my system.

PCI Express hot-plug has been tried (see above).  The original 
acpiphp driver won't detect hot-pluggable slots that locate on the
p2p bridge (PCI Express to PCI/PCI-X bridge) behind another p2p 
bridge (root port).  Therefore, the acpiphp can't be used for
standard PCI hot-plug in my system.
Thanks,
