All bugs are possibly fatal, or huge security holes, regardless of 
whether they are in binary-only code or open-source.
All bugs can be debugged or fixed, it's a matter of how hard it is to 
do (generally easier with open-source) and *who* is responsible for 
doing it (i.e. supporting the modules).

The same can be said about DriverLoader.

The purpose of the workaround is not to circumvent any protection, but 
to fix a real usability issue for systems in the field, which, as an 
expert you perhaps do not see, but users definitely massively felt and 
complained about.

I don't see our actions as being immoral at all. But in retrospect, I 
admit that the issue should have been differently handled (i.e. by 
sending patches, and perhaps starting a discussion on the lkml before 
implementing a workaround).

Most kernels are already potentially "tainted" by the use of 
proprietary binary-only BIOS code, use of non-standard custom patches, 
reliance on untrusted external data, etc.. This illustrates that the 
MODULE_LICENSE tainting concept is flawed, and needlessly 
scary/confusing for users.

I can understand that you do not really like what we are doing to 
provide alternative options so that people can use otherwise 
unsupported hardware.

But the main justification for the regrettable \0 trick remains that 
the tainted messages are redundant, confusing, and do not convey key 
information (i.e. who is responsible for supporting the third-party 
module) to ordinary users.

We are working on a new release, which will be on the website shortly.
And I hope that you will agree to deal with the root problem by 
incorporating some of the suggestions (or equivalent ones) that people 
have made to fix the messages.
