The udev situation I mentioned has been known about for at least a month,
probably longer. With old udev, we don't get /dev/input/event* created
with 2.6.15rc.
At some point in time it became defacto that certain things like udev, hotplug,
alsa-lib, wireless-tools and a bunch of others have to have kept in lockstep
with the kernel, and if it breaks, it's your fault for not upgrading
your userspace.
Seriously, I (and many others) have been complaining about this
for months. (Pretty much every time the "Please can we have a 2.7"
thread comes up). [note, that I actually prefer the 'new' approach
to development in 2.6, what I object to is that at the same time we
threw out the 'lets be careful about not breaking userspace' mantra.]
Just a few years ago, if someone suggested breaking a userspace
app in a kernel upgrade, they'd be crucified on linux-kernel, now
it's 'the norm').
