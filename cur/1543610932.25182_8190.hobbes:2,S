It is also broken by design. It forces file systems that need more
state to maintain read/write ahead to maintain their own cache (e.g. XFS
which needs to cache extent allocations) 
Better would be to just fix nfsd to cache open file handles, then all
this mess would be done by the VFS. In addition it would be faster
because it wouldn't need to execute an "open()" for every rpc operation.
