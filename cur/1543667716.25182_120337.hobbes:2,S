Subject: [Patch 2/8] 2.4: Fix for enormous numbers of buffers on BUF_LOCKED
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/3/25/138

Buffer_head syncing places BUF_DIRTY buffers on the BUF_LOCKED, but
buffers can stay there indefinitely, upsetting buffer accounting.  The
symptoms are benign, mostly just nonsensical numbers in alt-sysrq-m
output, but it's pretty cheap to clean these up in kupdated
nonetheless, just by refiling any unlocked buffers which happen to be
at the head of the BUF_LOCKED list.  (We stop at the first locked
buffer rather than walking the whole list, avoiding walking any
buffers more than once.)
