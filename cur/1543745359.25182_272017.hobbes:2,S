And this patch has tabs replaced with whitespace and also does not apply.

linux-2.6.9 is very very old in kernel time.

There is no mention of `remap_page_range' in current kernels.
Please, always generate patches against current kernels.  You can use
Linus's bk tree or the latest snapshot from
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/snapshots.
Sort out what's going on with your email client, email the patches to
yourself first, make sure they still apply, then resend.
Thanks.
