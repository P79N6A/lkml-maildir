I got you was proposing that but once we change it I preferred to use a generic
mm_arch structure (not just a context field) to have a more generic interface
in the long run.  (maybe some port wants to collect something else than a MM
`context')

What I propose is to convert the current:
	if (CTX_VALID(mm->context)) 
to
	if (CTX_VALID(mm->mm_arch.context))
(that's the same I did in the alpha tree from mm->context[] to
mm->mm_arch.context[])
I'm aware this way all ports actively using `mm->context' needs to be changed
but the change is certainly a no-brainer... OK?
