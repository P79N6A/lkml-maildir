Hi all.
after my last mail, talking about a oops in awe_wave mod, i´ve restore my date, as i said in mail. Now i´m already with time in
future... i think my machine doesn´t like my time now... is ignoring my EST time, anf\d after reboot i got +3 hours... to make the
test, i´ve restarted 5 times, and my clock jumps me to tomorrow, exactly 15 hours... someone´s here is having this crazy thing, or
just me and my machine is being crazy?
thanks.
