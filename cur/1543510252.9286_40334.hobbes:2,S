I ended up changing a few lines in mm/mmap.c to create a new do_mmap_anon()
interface that takes a vm_operations_struct pointer and tacks it on to the
newly created vma before the call to merge_segments().  This allows one to
map a new memory object (with its own vm_ops) into user space outside of the
context of an mmap() or other f_op call.
I also added a void *vm_data member to vm_area_struct which points to vm_ops 
implementation-specific data (you pass it in to do_mmap_anon() and pull it 
out in the vm_ops functions if needed).  In this way I can associate a memory 
object with a particular PCI card and fault in physical pages from the right 
card if there is more than one.
I'd be curious if these interfaces would be useful to anyone besides me, i.e.
are my odds of getting them accepted into the distribution as slim as I would
guess?
Your point about fighting the system is well taken.  On the other hand, this
is a port of a large amount of software from two SVR4-derived commercial 
unixes, and reworking the basic interfaces will cause much pain and suffering.
(Maybe we will end up redesiging, but for now I just need to get the thing to
work without turning it into an #ifdef nightmare). 
Thanks,
Jim
