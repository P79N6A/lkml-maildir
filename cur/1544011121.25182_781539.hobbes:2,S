We'll modify the code according to your suggestions..

We'll try to modify the code like below, but need more tests.
In via_sdc_preparedata() function:
    int sg_cnt;
    sg_cnt = dma_map_sg(mmc_dev(host->mmc), data->sg, data->sg_len, (data->flags & MMC_DATA_READ) ? DMA_FROM_DEVICE : DMA_TO_DEVICE);
    WARN_ON(sg_cnt != 1);
    via_set_ddma(host->chip, sg_dma_address(data->sg), sg_dma_len(data->sg), (data->flags & MMC_DATA_READ) ? DMA_FROM_DEVICE : DMA_TO_DEVICE );
In via_sdc_finish_data() function:
    dma_unmap_sg(mmc_dev(host->mmc), data->sg, data->sg_len, (data->flags & MMC_DATA_READ) ? DMA_FROM_DEVICE : DMA_TO_DEVICE);

The criteria are: 
1. Because the SD card detect operations need delay about 1 ms, so it should not be implemented in interrupt context. So we implement it by via_sdc_tasklet_card.
2. The STSTATUS_REG register must be reset quickly, so it should be implemented in interrupt context.
3. In order to finish one “request” from the mmc_block layer quickly, all operations (that can finished quickly) before the end of the “request” should be implemented in interrupt context.

We will try to optimize the ISR function.

OK, we will replae it. Thanks.
