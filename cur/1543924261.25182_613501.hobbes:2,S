If it was turned into a design policy...
My impression is that in some parts of the kernel every byte gets 
counted, while in other parts noone would notice a few kilobytes more or 
less.

Today it's exactly one year since your commit entered the tree.
Dear bug, happy birthday!  ;-)

It's not Kconfig's fault that you test for the wrong variable in 
usbnet.c ...

I don't understand why you think this bug was in any way related to 
NET_ETHERNET - set NET_ETHERNET=y and the bug is still present.
If you insist on the #ifdef's take the patch below - it even saves a few 
additional bytes if you have non-usbnet net drivers requiring MII 
enabled statically or as modules in your .config but no usbnet drivers 
requiring MII.

This patch fixes the following compile error with CONFIG_MII=m, 
CONFIG_USB_USBNET=y, CONFIG_USB_USBNET_MII=n:

and reported by Toralf Förster.

BTW:
The Kconfig part of this patch is not really required, but testing for
  #if defined(CONFIG_USB_USBNET_MII) || defined(CONFIG_USB_USBNET_MII_MODULE)
would look needlessly ugly.
