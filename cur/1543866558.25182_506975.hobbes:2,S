Following myself up...looks like David Howells already fixed this in  
a commit from Tuesday.  The patch I posted is actually a diff against  
that, which I didn't notice until now.  Whoops and nevermind.
I will pursue with appropriate folks stable backports for anyone  
running 2.6.18 or 2.6.19 in their distributions.
Thanks and apologies,
