The problem of getting windows utility output now is that it's the server 
in the datacenter, running 24/7 for many users. That's why I wanted to 
find out everything just in Linux.
This server is on Intel mainboard with Intel chassis, but it's not 
compatible with Win2k3, that's why they gave it to me for Linux :) 
Sometimes it's unstable under Linux too. I feel that the problem is in the 
hardware, may be CPU settings, cache etc... I set "acpi=ht pci=routeirq" 
to make it work at all. It has newest available BIOS installed.
Here is what Intel say about supported CPUs for this mobo:
SL623	2 GHz	N/A	N/A	400 MHz	0.13 micron	B0	512 KB 
Micro-FCPGA 0F24
SL5Z9	2 GHz	N/A	N/A	400 MHz	0.13 micron	B0	512 KB 
Micro-FCPGA 0F24
SL6YT	2 GHz	N/A	N/A	400 MHz	0.13 micron	D1	512 KB 
Micro-FCPGA 0F29h
SL6JY	2 GHz	N/A	N/A	400 MHz	0.13 micron	C1	512 KB 
Micro-FCPGA 0F27h
But none of them has HT! And my configuration - has! It's a puzzle for me.

Yeah. Definitely Intel has some secret tables to identify CPU :)
