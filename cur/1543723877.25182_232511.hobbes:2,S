To clarify, we make two sorts of requests for ids [minor numbers]:
  (a) What is the lowest unused id number?
  (b) Is id number N used or not?
If I interpret things correctly, in case (b) if N is larger than the
the highest id number currently stored it might still return non-NULL 
(if lower order bits match lower order bits of a different stored id).
[Would it be sufficient for the caller to keep track of the highest 
allocated ID and check before calling, or is the masking sometimes
stronger than that?]
