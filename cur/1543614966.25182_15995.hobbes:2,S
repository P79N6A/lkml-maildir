 My main "problem" with 2.4 as well. Using free memory for Cache/Buffers
is great, but only as long as the memory is not needed for running
tasks. As soon as a task is requesting more memory, it should be first
taken from Cache/Buffer (they are caches, aren't they :-). Only if this
has been used up (to a tunable minimum, see below), swapping and finally
OOM killing should happen.
 To prevent completely trashing IO performance, there should be tunable
parameters for minimum and maximum Cache/Buffer usage (lets say in
percent of total memory). Maybe those tunables are even there today and
I am just to stupid to find them :-))
 In any case, 2.4 Caches/Buffers show to much persistance. This is
basically true for both branches of VM. I was using the -ac kernels
because, being far from perfect, the VM gave considreabele better
interactive behaviour.

 That is another option. But I would prefer something that could be
selected dynamically or at boot time.
