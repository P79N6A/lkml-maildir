Any chance that at least the patch in the bug's discussion is accepted
in the next stable?

I tested the patch, and if the error message is still seen sometimes,
there is no crash
and the system can be shutdown properly (in its other parts). It maybe even more
useful to the original reporter of the problem, who experienced it on
a running system.
