It says that the disk geometry was taken from the partition table
(instead of using the heuristics that the kernel would use otherwise).
Since nobody except fdisk and lilo use the geometry, this is not
the cause of your booting problem.

An ancient bug in the Linux setup is that one doesnt specify the
root filesystem type. Instead, the kernel tries to interpret the
root filesystem in all possible ways until it finds a filesystem type
willing to recognize it.
Thus, if the root filesystem is xiafs and you have no xiafs
compiled into the kernel, things will fail this way.
Or, if the root filesystem is ext2 and ext2 was compiled as
a module, you'll have the same problem.
