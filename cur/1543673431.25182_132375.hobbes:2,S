Any particular bits?

Maybe... There are arguments either way, but if the token ring is kept in
struct user, a task can't detach from it and pass a token-less set of keys
onto another process it wants to run.
Also, using a separate PAG structure means that you can lend your keys to an
SUID program and conversely it means a SUID program can't so easily gain
access to keys it didn't inherit from its caller.
I'm not sure that the ability to arbitrarily join a PAG should be permitted,
but it was requested.
