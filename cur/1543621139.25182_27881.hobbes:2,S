If you have read my previous posts, you know that the current behaviour is
broken, allows users to glitch the system performance at no benefit to the
issuing process, etc. In other words sync is now currently broken, in
terms of both theory, practice, and standard.

Of course between the sync and execution of the reboot the disk buffers
may be totally full again, and if shutdown isn't close to instant perhaps
you have a faulty shutdown and should fix it.

The sync doesn't protect my data, after my data has been written why
should I care to wait while all the data in every active program in the
system gets written. This makes checkpoints stop points on a busy system.

If that maps into write the current dirty buffers and get on with life,
yes. I posted a better solution for comment, I won't duplicate that here.

I can't see anyone taking that reading or that implementation, so let's
not discuss how badly we can do a standard conforming kernel, this is
Linux, we do the best at everything once we figure out what that really
means;-)

Read or reread my other notes on that, journal prevents directory
corruption, it doesn't prevent data loss like a database transaction.
Returning to a known good state does not include "without losing any data
written to unclosed files."
I leave it to Mr Reiser to clarify that or correct me if data is protected
without using unbuffered writes.
