Hugh, thank you.  In the case of futex.c, either flag could be used to
mean "is this a shared" mapping, and each choice has a different
user-visible meaning.
Most of the VM code uses VM_SHARED to ask the question "is this a
shared mapping", but it turns out that most of the VM code means
something different by that than what is meant in userspace.  To the
VM code, a "shared mapping" means something which can dirty
backing-file pages, either after mmap() or maybe mprotect() as well.
This is different to the userspace point of view.  The common language
is unfortunate.  (IMHO the flag should be called VM_SHAREDWRITABLE).
With futex.c using VM_SHARED to determine whether to hash on
(inode,offset,index), mappings of read-only file handles will hash on
(mm,uaddr) which is not correct: a FUTEX_WAIT on a shared mapping
using userspace's meaning of "shared mapping" should notice changes in
a different mm.
Therefore, futex.c will use VM_MAYSHARE in my next patch.
Thanks,
