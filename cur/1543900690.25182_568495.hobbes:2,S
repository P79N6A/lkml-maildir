Then do what we do for FADV_SEQUENTIAL.  With that advice, we double the 
readahead window.  We're already doing readahead, but we do a lot more 
when we have the advice.  NOREUSE should put much greater pressure on 
the vm to drop these pages quickly, or perhaps simply eliminate the 
heuristic evaluation of the access pattern and short-circuit straight to 
dropping the pages.
We should be encouraging application writers to actually use things like 
fadvise when they can tune things more intelligently than kernel 
heuristics can.
