No, PPC systems don't reorder writes to PCI devices.  Provided you use
inl/outl/readl/writel et al., all PCI accesses from one processor are
strictly ordered, and if you use a spinlock, that gives you strict
access ordering between processors.
Our barrier instructions mostly order cacheable accesses separately
from non-cacheable accesses, except for the strongest barrier
instruction, which orders everything.  Thus it would be useful for us
to have an explicit indication of when a cacheable write (i.e. to main
memory) has to be completed (from a PCI device's point of view) before
a non-cacheable device read or write (e.g. to kick off DMA).
