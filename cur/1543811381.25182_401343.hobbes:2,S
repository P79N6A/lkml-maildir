Common in what sense? all radeons that have DRM enabled use the CP to
do 2D XAA accel, the drm is the interface to the CP, granted it
doesn't do a huge amount of work, X sets up all the accel in an
indirect buffer, and just tells the DRM where the buffer starts.. so
it isn't doing a lot in the kernel.
