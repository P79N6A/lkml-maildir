Frankly, I hardly understand what do you mean :-)

This implies JFFS2 can not write to flash. This must a problem of 
underlying layers (your driver is buggy, your HW is broken, etc).

This probably a bug in JFFS2 - it doesn't handle an error gracefully.
Please, do the following:
1. inform us about your kernel version;
2. explore 
http://www.linux-mtd.infradead.org
 carefully;
3. try the latest MTD snapshot;
4. post to the MTD mailing list - all the MTD people are there.
If the last snapshot doesn't help, then:
1. enable MTD debugging and JFFS2 debug level 1 in your .config;
2. post the JFFS2/MTD debugging output;
3. post the output of 'cat /proc/mtd;
4. use the last MTD snapshot.
Cheers,
Artem.
