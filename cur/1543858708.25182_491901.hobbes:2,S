Actually, my preference would be to use the parentheses AND drop the
spaces:   (3*i)+(2*j) . But, existing kernel code seems to prefer just
using spaces and adding parentheses when it gets complicated. Note
that the mistake in your example was in a relatively simple
expression.
I think the unary operator case is a little different - it's not so
much to make precedence clear as just to help the reader chunk the
pieces of the string more naturally (at least, it's more natural to
anyone who's ever done anything object-oriented). I agree that your
spacing example, above, also helps that way, but it seems better to do
it in a way that's meaningful o the compiler as well as to the reader.
