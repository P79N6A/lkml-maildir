	I am running 2.5.31 on two computers that have a Via vt82c686b
chipset (in addition to some other computers).  I am running them with
IDE as module and with CONFIG_PREEMPT (with Skip Ford's fix), and I
also booted one without CONFIG_PREEMPT.  On one machine, I have booted
the kernel about ten times.  These are multiprocessor kernels running on
uniprocessor machines.

	While you're waiting for someone who knows what they're doing
to respond, you might to try booting 2.5.31 with the CDROM and second
hard disk unplugged to narrow down what is triggering the hang.  If
it still hangs, you might try dd'ing the vmlinux to a floppy, and
unplugging the first hard disk to see if the kernel gets past IDE
detect with no drives attached and, if so, with only the second
cable attached (the one with the Maxtor and the CD-ROM drive).
	By the way, you might want to post the make and model of that
"IC35L040AVER07-0" primary hard disk.  Perhaps someone else who has
tried 2.5.31 with that hard disk will be able to tell you how they
fared.
	By the way, I see that you forwarded those BUG_ON patches
in ntfs to Linus and that they're in 2.5.31.  Thanks for doing that
so quickly.
