There is nothing in there tells ya how to get them off the same IRQ.
That has to be done first usually be moving one of them to another
slot/bus. Then Documentation/IRQ-affinity.txt can be referenced.
Somehow I think Jan already knew that and really wants to know
how to keep them from sharing the same irq without having to
change slot assignments. I know I would.
