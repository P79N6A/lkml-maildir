How is it confusing?  And who is it confusing for?
It will potentially require kernel developers to think for just 
a moment about what is going on.  But why care about them -- 
they don't have to *use* this interface; userland programmers do.
I have tried to argue in the clearest way I can that the current 
interface (uschare(CLONE_*) is confusing for *users* of this API.
Do you care about the interface that is inflicted on users?
When you give users an interface with the same name, they
expect it to do the same thing.  When their expectations are 
broken, they write bugs.  There are already precedents, 
with much less justification, for defining separate flag names
for different interfaces.  For example, poll() uses constants
with names of the form POLL*, while epoll uses constant
with *EXACTLY* the same meanings, but named EPOLL*.

What problems do you think can occur?  And what happens on the 
day when unshare() needs a flag that clone() does not have?

By which time, the discussion is over.  Since "we don't 
break userspace", we can't (shouldn't) reverse whatever goes
into 2.6.16.
Cheers,
Michael
