Too bad. Hopefully that code will work then on the hypothetic
future parts with fixed throttling. Perhaps it would be better
to just remove it now and readd later.
All this reminds me you need to adjust the Kconfig dependencies
for K8_NB too to be always enabled with MCE_AMD.
Ideally on top of this patch with a || MCE_AMD

Fix and simplify k8.c Kconfig dependencies
- Check for K8_NUMA instead of NUMA && PCI
- No need to check for x86_64 explicitely
