Ingo, Jeremy,
For reference, here's the set of patches I've been testing on powerpc
using swiotlb with HIGHMEM enabled. I think if we can deal with the
issues I mentioned in my previous mail, we should be able to use the
patch series Jeremy published on ppc - I'm just sticking this out here
since I'm about to fall off the internet for a while. I'll look at
getting your code working on ppc as soon as I'm back online.
Cheers,
Becky
