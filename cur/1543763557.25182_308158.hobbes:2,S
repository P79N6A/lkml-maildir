The 10 machines for running benchmarks is not a bad infrastructure to
start with.  However, it may not be sufficient to identify performance
regression.  The benchmarks that show regression in Linux kernel requires
huge infrastructure - lots of memory, disks, network and clients.  The
simple benchmarks sometime do not show regression and are usually well
covered by the community and OSDL.
As mentioned in another thread, we (as Intel) will take on the challenge
to do performance testing on a regular basis.  We have fairly extensive
hardware mix and infrastructure (large smp/numa box with lots of memory,
disk farm, network etc) to really stress the kernel, performance wise.
