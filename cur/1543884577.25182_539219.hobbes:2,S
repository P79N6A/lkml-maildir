I haven't looked seriously into it since it was pretty much rewritten.
What I need is very close control over the lowlevel handling to minimize the 
number of indirect calls and to get the interrupt delivered as fast as 
possible. (E.g. we even patch the assembler entry, so the basic flow control 
is pretty much fixed after boot.)
I don't mind the if the general management is a bit more complex, but how do I 
get rid of all the useless code?
At a bit closer look e.g. irq_desc would need a serious diet, it can produce a 
pretty large table...
bye, Roman
