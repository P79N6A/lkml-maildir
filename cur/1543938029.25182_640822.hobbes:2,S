I have a question concerning the ordering of devices during the boot process and I hope that the kernel mailing list is the right place for this question.
In my computer are two raid controllers with one raid array connected to each of them (/dev/sda, /dev/sdb). In the debian 2.6.18 boot process the ordering is root @ /dev/sda and data are on /dev/sdb. This behaviour has changed in the plain 2.6.23.1 (and 2.6.23.8) kernel. The /dev/sd(a|b) devices have switched so that root @ /dev/sdb. So my standard fstab does not work.
What determines the device ordering during the boot process? What is a workaround for this problem?
Thank you very much for some hints,
   Lars
