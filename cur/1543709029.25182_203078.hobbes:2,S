Subject: Is the 2.6 dependency information complete? Doesn't look so...

Hi,
I've just seen, after a BK pull:
  CC      fs/nfsd/nfsctl.o
fs/nfsd/nfsctl.c:28:30: linux/nfsd_idmap.h: no such file or directory
This is a hint the dependency information isn't complete, otherwise, GNU
make would've "get"^Wgot the include file.
Will the kernel rebuild dependent files when includes change when this
information is missing? If so, how?
TIA,
