Hi there.
Somebody sent me an email with comments regarding problems with the
Linux Kernel Version History pages for people suffering from colour
blindness. Unfortunately, I suffered a power cut whilst reading your
email, and when the power came back and I got back online, your email
had vanished, so can you please resend it.
Some points I will make with regards to this point though, which you
may wish to consider when resending it:
 1. I suffer from Red-Green colour blindness myself, with the
    result that I am not the ideal person to determine colour
    schemes for web pages. It is largely for this reason that
    I keep my pages reasonably simple, and don't normally use
    lavish colour schemes.
 2. Because of the above, I designed the pages to be readable
    easily by myself, and by people suffering from the same
    form of colour blindness. In general, I find pages on a
    Cyan background the easiest to read, which is why I have
    used that colour scheme on my pages.
I am of course willing to listen to any criticism on this front, and
to try out any suggestions that come my way, but if I can't read the
resulting pages myself, they will not go online. I consider this to be
reasonable.
Best wishes from Riley.
PS: The kernel versions page is now back online at the URL below, and
    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
