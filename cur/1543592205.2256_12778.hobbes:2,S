I'm using (at the end of /etc/init.d/halt):
cat /sbin/halt > /dev/null
cat /bin/sleep > /dev/null
hdparm -Y /dev/hdd
hdparm -Y /dev/hdc
hdparm -Y /dev/hdb
hdparm -Y /dev/hda
/bin/sleep 2
/sbin/halt -d -f -i -p
It works fine for me for years... I had to put sleep 2 here, as otherwise
CDROM drive does not park its head correctly (as hdparm /dev/hdc causes
ide-cd/cdrom to load - and this causes CDROM to spin up :-( )
So I do not see any reason for doing HDD park by kernel...

P.S.: AFAIK all IDE disks autopark. At least my 41MB KALOK from 1990
did. Or at least tried...
