	Do use some MUA software which handles MIME formats properly,
	and stop whining.   Oddly I recall that  EXMH  was used as
	a prototype platform during the MIME specification development.
	Most a bit more versatile MUAs can handle MIME structures
	properly these days, including pine, mutt, netscape communicator,
	etc.  (I almoast included exmh there, but apparently it does not
	do it, if you have any reason to complain...)
	FYI: Linus uses PINE 4.10  for his email, I use mutt, although
	modified so that it won't squirt in any "X-Mailer:" headers.
