Hi:
I was trying to get the native IPsec stack working under 2.4.  It almost
worked except that NEWSA was coming back with ENOENT.   It turned out
that the esp module that I loaded was trying to register character
devices :) It didn't bite me under 2.5 as drivers/char/esp.c didn't
compile.
So one of them's got to be renamed.  Do you have a preference as to
which way to go?
Thanks,
