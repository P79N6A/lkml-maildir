	Well, is there any way you can make the threads last longer?
If they're that short, I don't know if they'd be scheduled on multiple
CPUs or not.  The problem being I don't know how much locking has to
happen to create the thread (locking where neither CPU is able to do
much of anything because the kernel is playing w/ memory).  If thread
creation is a very small impact, then I'd guess yes.
	The problem as I see it w/ what you're talking about is more
a question of if it's worth spawning off a new thread to do the task
or just doing it in the next loop.  I have no doubt that the thread
will run on a seperate CPU if you're using pthread's (glibc) and it
needs the CPU time.  Though if it's only around for < 0.1 seconds,
not sure that's enough CPU time.  But then, it could start on a
different CPU, not sure...
