There appears to be more to it than that. RxRPC has sequencing and ACKing
windows and things that I don't think SUNRPC has (basically it tries to do
some of TCP itself). I've attached the struct definitions for the RxRPC header
and the ACK packet body from my RxRPC implementation for your reference.
Furthermore, RxRPC allows for big binary blobs to be interpolated in the
middle of packets (though if I understand it correctly it effectively encodes
them as an XDR octet array of sorts).
