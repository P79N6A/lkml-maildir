Subject: [Suspend2][ 0/4] Files shared with swsusp.

Modifications to files shared with swsusp. We implement
CONFIG_SUSPEND_SHARED, which is selected by either swsusp
or Suspend2 and causes the parts required by either
implementation to be compiled in. Swsusp's kernel/power
files are compiled in after Suspend2's because Suspend2
recognises swsusp files and ignores them, but swsusp doesn't
recognise Suspend2 signatures and complains about them.
