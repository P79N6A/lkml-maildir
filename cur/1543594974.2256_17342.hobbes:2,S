Hi,
Thanks for your comment,
I haven't used read_config_nybble, write_config_nybble in order to use the
same code with this kernel patch (2.4.X) and a patch for pcmcia-cs
(pci_fixup.c) to use with linux 2.2.X
I think it would be better to rewrite the patch using the nybble functions
and "import" the nybble functions to the pcmcia-cs code, I will work on
it tomorrow and send it to the kernel mailing list.
Again, Thanks for the comment and for take the time to review the code.
Best wishes,
