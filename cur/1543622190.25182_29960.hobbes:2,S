Yes... I think there was some earlier confusion.  PCI API is definitely
an API for registering hosts.
If you have a C structure "struct drive", it may be useful to have a
pointer to struct pci_dev.  That is just a reference from drive back to
the host.  So you could do crazy references like this pseudocode:
  struct pci_dev *host_pci;
  struct ata_host *host_ata;
  struct ata_channel *channel;
  host_pci = cur_drive->pci_dev;
  host_ata = pci_get_drvdata(host_pci);
  channel = &host_ata->channels[cur_drive->channel_number];
These back-references are very useful, and use of a concept like this
may be the source of confusion.
