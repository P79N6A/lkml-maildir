It does not matter whether it makes sense to you or not. It is a command 
line option which bricks systems. There is neither an explanation in 
Dokumentation/kernel-parameters.txt nor a check in the code, which 
disables this completely.
It makes a lot of sense even with the existing architecture. Trouble 
shooting a box, where the local apic timer does not work correctly is not 
an UP only requirement.
Yes, it is a hack, a _bad_ hack.

I understand the code quite well. I'm just surprised from time to time by 
interesting hacks in the so clean x8664 tree.

No, it's not dangerous. We spent quite some time to make the clock events 
layer flexible enough to handle the current problems and the design allows 
to add more infrastructure when necessary. The maybe new (mis)features of 
upcoming CPUs need to be addressed with or without clock events and they 
need to be done careful and not by random hacks.
