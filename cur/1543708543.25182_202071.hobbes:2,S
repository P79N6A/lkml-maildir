Another idea that we are playing with for handling programs like xmms 
(i.e. programs that require gauranteed CPU bandwidth to perform well) is 
the complement of caps namely per task CPU reservations.  The 
availability of CPU usage rate statistics for each task makes this 
possible but the question is "Is the functionality worth the extra 
overhead?".
Of course, this won't solve the "need to be root" problem as this is 
obviously the sort of control that should be reserved for root but it is 
arguably better than having to guess how many shares a task needs to 
ensure that it gets the required CPU bandwidth.
