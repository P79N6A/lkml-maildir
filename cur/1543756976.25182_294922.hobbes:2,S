There are a number of techniques used by CE vendors to get fast bootup
time.  Some CE products boot Linux in under 1 second.  Sony's
best Linux boot time in the lab (from power on to user space)
was 148 milliseconds, on an ARM chip (running at 200 MHZ I believe).
Every product I know of that boots in under 1 second does it
by completely eliminating RC scripts, and using a custom init
program.
For anyone interested, CELF has some resources on this topic at:
