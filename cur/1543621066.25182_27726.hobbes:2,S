I try to compile 2.2.16 om a celeron 433 and i get the following error 
message all the time even
if i have SMP totally disabled.
`smp_num_cpus` undeclared (first use in this function)
And some similial rows.
Nothing yet has managed to help me with this.
And please note that SMP is disabled. I DONT have several CPU's.
Any help would be HIGHLY appreciated.
