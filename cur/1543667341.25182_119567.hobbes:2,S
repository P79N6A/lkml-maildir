Subject: ISAPNP BUG: 2.4.65 ne2000 driver w. isapnp not working

Hello.
Have some trouble with loading modules (see earlier message).  
Tried to compile a driver in.
dmesg:
-------
isapnp: Scanning for PnP cards...
isapnp: Card Plug & Play Ethernet card
isapnp: 1 Plug and Play card detected total
------
- no further references do isapnp in logs
- Same card works (with pnp disabled (jumper) and driver compiled 
as a module) by modprobing it with io=0x300
- Same card works with 2.4.21-pre5 driver as module both with pnp 
and modual probing
	Regards
	Michael
