The caller of __mod_timer did not fill in the function member.
I decoded the conglomeration of characters which seems to be the driver
source - shudder - and actually the init code of the driver initializes
the TuningTimer after register_netdev, which leads to a race with the
hotplug code. "Working perfectly" on older kernels is just by chance not
by design.
