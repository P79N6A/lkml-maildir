Interesting. That code should have been enough, but we've later on added
extra code into wait_task_zombie to check _exactly_ the same case because
we saw problems.
Hmm.. Maybe that was to protect against concurrent wait4()'ers (which can
happen - the wait case only takes the read lock). Threads can wait for
each others children, after all.
