Nod.  I really don't think the key penguins understand that there is 
even a problem here.  Let me attempt to re-state the problem:
	There is no flag day when "bugfixes only" mode begins.
There are two component to this problem:
1) Release maintainers need to avoid merging non-bugfixes.  Lately, the 
key penguins _have_ been doing their job here.  This manifested in 
2.6.11-rc4, 2.6.11-rc5.
2) This "flag day" when bugfixes-only mode starts needs to be completely 
obvious to _scripts_ and really dumb people.  Posting to LKML "with this 
-rc, I am only taking serious bugfixes" doesn't cut it.  There must be a 
clear, consistent point where testing may begin.
As a result of this problem, people have learned [just re-read this 
thread if you don't believe me] that "-rc" doesn't really mean Release 
Candidate until -rc2 or -rc3 or so.  And as a result of that, people do 
less testing.
