I have two old out-of-print unix device driver books if anyone wants them:
Writing a Unix Device Driver (Paperback) by Janet I. Egan, Thomas J. Teixeira
http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Unix-Device-Driver-Janet/dp/0471535753
Writing UNIX Device Drivers (Paperback) by George Pajari (Author)
http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Device-Drivers-George-Pajari/dp/0201523744
These might be useful to someone curious about unix drivers in ancient times.
For kicks I have these three Windows NT driver books as well:

http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Windows-WDM-Device-Drivers/dp/0879305657
email me directly if anyone is interested .. or they'll end up in the
recycle bin!
