In most cases one of the strings is constant and thus the length known 
at compiletime. I have no idea whether we are allowed (in kernel space)
to read beyond the end of a string, iff we are we could simply use the
fixed length.

Time has shown that the obvious solution is often not the fastest one.
:) Though in this case it really might be.
