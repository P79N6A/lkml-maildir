Sorry for the slow response. I switched email clients and gained a bogus
filter along the way (entirely my fault, of course).
As Dave said, he might make use of them too. I use about 5 or 6 of these,
depending upon exactly how Suspend2 is configured.
In the meanwhile, AKPM gave me a suggestion for a better solution
(radix-trees). My algorithms & data-structures course was 14 years ago,
so I'll go dust off Kingston (IIRC) and learn what he's talking about again :)
Thanks for the feedback and regards,
Nigel
