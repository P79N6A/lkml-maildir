And you have been given evidence that it does. It may not break the spirit as 
you, or anyone else that believes that the FSF is the singular fountain of 
truth, see it. But it does break the spirit as a large fraction of the 
populace see it. Why do they like GPL3? Because they don't like what TiVO 
did - they see it and say "but that's not fair", so when they see that GPL3 
makes it a license violation they accept GPL3 without understanding the 
bigger picture.
To *anyone* who is considered an "Adult" in *ANY* nation and still wants to 
scream "its not fair" when something doesn't go their way or somebody does 
something they don't like I have this to say: Grow up! Life *ISN'T* fair - at 
all.

Not even. If it's anything it's "input to a program". QED: It isn't covered by 
the license. Hell, give me a week and access to a signed TiVO kernel and I'll 
produce a signed kernel that is functionally equivalent - it won't run on a 
TiVO, but I'll have replicated the "signing script" and process that TiVO 
uses. It isn't until you start extending the definition of source code in 
strange ways that the key becomes "source code". Hell, for all *anyone* knows 
(that isn't employed by TiVO) they could enter the key *manually* - ie: 
interactive input.
