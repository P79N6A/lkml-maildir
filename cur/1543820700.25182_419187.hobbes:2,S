This kind of agrees with my result ie. list_del() in isolate_lru_pages():
0xffffffff80265b7a is in isolate_lru_pages (list.h:160).
155      * Note: list_empty on entry does not return true after this, the entry is
156      * in an undefined state.
157      */
158     static inline void list_del(struct list_head *entry)
159     {
160             BUG_ON(entry->prev->next != entry);
161             BUG_ON(entry->next->prev != entry);
162             __list_del(entry->prev, entry->next);
163             entry->next = LIST_POISON1;
164             entry->prev = LIST_POISON2;
It looks like we have passed an empty list or a NULL to list_del().  Strange.
Greetings,
