And so you had - but not there (you [nearly] do it twice :-). I have taken
the liberty of changing the date formats in my copy to "12 Jul 1999" format
'cos I am european.

My, obviously excessively veiled, point is that either there is some
difference in 'top' or else it seems that an apache process can occupy 1 1/2
times as virtual memory on 2.2.10 as it does on 2.0.3[67](~24Mb -> ~10Mb).
Further, on my machine and on my copy of apache 1.3.6 + mod_perl 1.21, if I
terminate the httpd server it will panic the kernel in 2.2.10. 
I don't have sufficient time to track down the exact cause of this, but just
as a guess, I suspect this has something to do with the fact that the virtual
memory consumed (even though it is nearly all shared) is actually greater
than the physical memory + available swap space. Under 2.2.10 I had 11
servers (1 + 10) each about 25Mb of which 24Mb was shared. Add to that a copy
of netscape, gnome, a few rxvts and X on 128Mb RAM + 128Mb swap machine (even
though it isn't showing as using any much swap) you have over 300Mb of
'shared' RAM. I suspect this might have something to do with it.

Dirk
