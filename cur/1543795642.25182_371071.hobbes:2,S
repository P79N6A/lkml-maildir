I don't think so.  (see below)

Looking at this deeper, I think we should _only_ use mapbase in this
case.  membase is really a indeterminant cookie which bears no real
relationship to whether two ports are identical - in fact, if we are
going to compare two of these cookies, I think arch code should be
involved.
So how about:
-             return (port1->membase == port2->membase);
+             return (port1->mapbase == port2->mapbase);
?
