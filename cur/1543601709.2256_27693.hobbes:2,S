bx chipsets have a limitation of 128mb per bank for non-registered dimms
afaik.  ie. 256mb dimms that are two-bank will work as expected, and
256mb dimms that are one-bank will be seen as 128mb.  generally two-bank
256mb dimms have chips on both sides of the module, whereas one-bank
jobbies have it on one side...  found this out the expensive way :-(
of course this isnt relevant to abit kt7 boards but it does sound very
similar.
