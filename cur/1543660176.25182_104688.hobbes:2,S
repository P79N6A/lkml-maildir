yes, i have a HT testbox and working code:

the patch is rather old, i'll update it to 2.5.59.

Intel's HT is the cleanest case: pure logical cores, which clearly need
special handling. Whether the other SMT solutions want to be handled via
the logical-cores code or via another level of NUMA-balancing code,
depends on benchmarking results i suspect. It will be one more flexibility
that system maintainers will have, it's all set up via the
sched_map_runqueue(cpu1, cpu2) boot-time call that 'merges' a CPU's
runqueue into another CPU's runqueue. It's basically the 0th level of
balancing, which will be fundamentally different. The other levels of
balancing are (or should be) similar to each other - only differing in
weight of balancing, not differing in the actual algorithm.
