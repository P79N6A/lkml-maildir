Hi,
  Thanks for your report.
  Can you repeat this Oops? I've seen reports of it before, and it
seems to indicate that the 'f_count' from the file pointer is out of
sync (the Oops is due to the f_dentry being NULL, so that the attempt
to reference f_dentry->inode fails).
  If you have found a way of reproducing it, do you think you could
'echo 72 >/proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug' and then provoke the Oops? I
need to find out what is going wrong with the file count...
BTW: is anybody seeing this problem on non-SMP machines?
Cheers,
  Trond
