Subject: [patch 2.6.25-rc5] kerneldoc for <linux/clk.h>
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

+     <title>Clock Framework</title>
+
+     <para>
+	The clock framework defines programming interfaces to support
+	software management of the system clock tree.
+	This framework is widely used with System-On-Chip (SOC) platforms
+	to support power management and various devices which may need
+	custom clock rates.
+	Note that these "clocks" don't relate to timekeeping or real
+	time clocks (RTCs), each of which have separate frameworks.
+	These <structname>struct clk</structname> instances may be used
+	to manage for example a 96 MHz signal that is used to shift bits
+	into and out of peripherals or busses, or otherwise trigger
+	synchronous state machine transitions in system hardware.
+     </para>
+
+     <para>
+	Power management is supported by explicit software clock gating:
+	unused clocks are disabled, so the system doesn't waste power
+	changing the state of transistors that aren't in active use.
+	On some systems this may be backed by hardware clock gating.
+	Circuits will still have leakage current to be managed, which
+	costs more with finer cicuit geometries, but for CMOS circuits
+	power is mostly spent by clocked state changes.
+	Sections of chips that are powered but not clocked may be able
+	to retain their last state.
+	This low power state is often called a <emphasis>retention
+	mode</emphasis>, in contrast to <emphasis>off</emphasis> where
+	power is cut and no state is retained but where leakage currents
+	may have a significant impact on battery life.
+     </para>
+
+     <para>
+	Power-aware drivers only enable their clocks when the device
+	they manage is in active use.  Also, system sleep states often
+	differ according to which clock domains are active:  while a
+	"standby" state may allow wakeup from several active domains, a
+	"mem" (suspend-to-RAM) state may require a more wholesale shutdown
+	of clocks derived from higher speed PLLs and oscillators, limiting
+	the number of possible wakeup event sources.  A driver's suspend
+	method may need to be aware of system-specific clock constraints
+	on the target sleep state.
+     </para>
+
+     <para>
+        Some platforms support programmable clock generators.  These
+	can be used by external chips of various kinds, such as other
+	CPUs, multimedia codecs, and devices with strict requirements
+	for interface clocking.
