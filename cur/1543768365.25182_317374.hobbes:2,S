Except for output on --show-depends and total number of forks, yes.
Based on comments from Greg and Christian, it would be better to apply
blacklisting only to the result of alias expanding for kernel generated
module maps.  So:
	cat >> /etc/hotplug/blacklist.d/test <<//
	blacklist snd_rme96
	//
would apply to
	modprobe 'pci:v000010EEd00003FC0sv*sd*bc*sc*i*'
but not to
	modprobe snd_rme96

Yep.  At the moment my initramfs builder aborts on such install directives,
because there's no correct way of handling them.  Since install isn't used
all that much and certainly not in boot-critical stuff, thats acceptable, 
but if we're going to use install for every blacklisted module,
that's a problem.

That would keep existing blacklist, which is good for Marco and 
for initramfs builders.
However, it would be bad for hotplug-ng: one of the strong points
is that it speeds booting by dropping loads of shell code, and
adding sed for blacklist processing does not fit well with that.
I'll take a stab at a patch that introduces the 'blacklist' keyword
to see if that reduces the code enough to make it acceptable.

Erik
