Hi!
I just noticed, that a process with nice level 19, gets some processor
time, even if there is another process, which would use all of the
processor time.
for example, there is a setiathome running at nice level 19, and a
bladeenc at nice level 0. setiathome uses 14 percent, and bladeenc uses 84
percent of the processor. I think, setiathome should use max 2-3 percent.
the 14 percent is way too much for me.
or is there any other way to run a process only if nothing uses the
processor?
with kernel 2.2.16 it worked for me.
now I use 2.4.2-ac20
Bye,
Szabi
