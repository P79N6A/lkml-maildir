Where is the race?
  open /dev/foo
    request_module(foo)
      load foo, mark !MOD_USED_ONCE.
    continue with open, MOD_INC_USE_COUNT(foo), mark MOD_USED_ONCE.
    return to use, module is locked down
  User space closes /dev/foo
    Release foo resources.
      MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT(foo)
        return to user space
  rmmod -a cleans up.  Nothing is using foo, it is removed.
