i think it's prudent to add an extension mechanism, regardless of demand. 
Existing bootloader projects will be content with the IDs they already 
have so they are unlikely to request new ones. Future bootloader projects 
cannot request it because they dont exist yet. So there's no-one to talk 
up.
