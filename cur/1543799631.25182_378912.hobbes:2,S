No, the place in the sysfs tree you are putting this is just fine.  I'm
just saying that you do not need to create a new kobject for these
attributes.  Just use an attribute group, and you will get the same
naming, without the need for an extra kobject (and the whole array of
kobjects) at all.
Does that make more sense?

Then you should probably go change it so that CPU_DEAD is defined on
non-smp builds, otherwise the code gets quite messy like the above :)
