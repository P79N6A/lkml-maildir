I will try this as well; I get a ton of errors and lockup within 24
hours running 2.3.99-pre3 on a dual PIII machine:
APIC error interrupt on CPU#0, should never happen.
... APIC ESR0: 00000002

... bit 1: APIC Receive CS Error (hw problem).
... bit 3: APIC Receive Accept Error.

Indicentally, ls /proc/irq lists every entry more than once:
