Right. ROTFL... volatile actually breaks atomic_t instead of making it 
safe. x++ becomes a register load, increment and a register store. Without 
volatile we can increment the memory directly. It seems that volatile 
requires that the variable is loaded into a register first and then 
operated upon. Understandable when you think about volatile being used to 
access memory mapped I/O registers where a RMW operation could be 
problematic.
