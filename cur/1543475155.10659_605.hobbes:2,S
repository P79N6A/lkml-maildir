Its been awhile since I've made any changes to the code and so I am
still running 2.1.121 with some of my own modifications.  Then, the
problem did not exist and everything worked fine.  I saw that some
significant changes were made around 2.1.130 to some of the dcache
code that had a significant impact on vfat, but I haven't been working
with any of these.  It took me quite awhile to get all (or at least most)
of the problems dealt with so that my test suite was happy again before
the latest set of changes was made, and I was happy with where things
were given the code freeze.  However, it seems that whatever changes
were made once again made the vfat code unstable, and I haven't had
time to look for all the problems again.  I've been busy with a startup,
so I haven't been keeping on top of things.
