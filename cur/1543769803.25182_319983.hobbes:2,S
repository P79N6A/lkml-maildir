The DCO yes.

It actually doesn't help. EU privacy law rather sensibly is "opt-in".
Putting the statement in the DCO, which is a document and submission
agreement works because you have to agree to it, putting it in a
document is probably not "opt-in".
You have to -actively- agree to the DCO to submit a change, and that is
what makes it work (whether you put something in submitting patches or
not that is more explanatory).
