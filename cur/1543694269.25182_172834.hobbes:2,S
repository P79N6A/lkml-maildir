Isn't those higher-priority writes issued from userspace?
I am of course assuming that source for _everything_ is available.
So the process with the high-priority write can tell vacuum to
take a nap until its transaction completes.

It can run at full speed normally, take voluntary pauses if it ever
detects a "nothing to do now" condition. And it can be paused
(forcibly or through cooperation) when there are important transactions
to sync.

Don't that other process know when it is about to submit important transactions?
