I'm sorry you feel disappointed. But I assure you that EVMS will continue to 
provide the same experience you have come to expect. All this decision really 
means is that we will be building on a different kernel component, instead of 
providing our own. All of the EVMS tools and libraries will essentially be 
unchanged from the perspective of most users.

And we will still maintain that modular design. In fact, we see this as 
making the design even more modular, since it won't have to be tied to a 
single kernel driver. Device mapper can be used for supporting disk 
partitions, LVM, and some other plugins. The MD driver can be used to support 
software RAID. We've even had thoughts about building on the existing loop 
driver in order to provide the partition-level encryption that you mentioned. 
And all of this from a single, unified interface.

Actually, it *is* the users that we are most concerned with. This is why we 
are going to make such an effort to keep our tools as unchanged as possible. 
But we really do think that this is the best solution in the long term, for 
both the users and the developers.
If you continue to have any concerns about this, please let us know. We will 
do our best to address them and explain any other details about this change 
that you are unsure of.
