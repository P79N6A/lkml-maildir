Subject: 2.4.0-test5: soundcore use count goes wacky
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here is what lsmod gives:
---<snip>---
Module                  Size  Used by
[...]
soundcore               3588162870 (autoclean)
---<snip>---
Initially, soundcore is 'used' 34 times (after I login with gdm), and when
I load XMMS, soundcore goes up by about 12 per second.
The 2.4.0-test5 kernel was compiled with gcc 2.95.2 with K6 optimizations.
