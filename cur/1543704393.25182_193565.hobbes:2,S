The Fedora version of the kernel-utils RPM includes /usr/sbin/readahead, which
gets launched like this:
start() {
    echo -n $"Starting background readahead: "
    /usr/sbin/readahead /usr/share/icons/Bluecurve/48x48/mimetypes/* &
    /usr/sbin/readahead /usr/share/icons/Bluecurve/24x24/stock/* &
    /usr/sbin/readahead /usr/share/applications/* &
    /usr/sbin/readahead `cat /etc/readahead.files` &
}
So given that program, you could simpy strace your KDE stuff, grep out all the
open calls and the filenames, stick them in /etc/readahead.files, and be done.
