It already is in the quirks list.
The problem is that LUN 0 does not show up on this machine, so the 
quirks table doesn't work.  Looking at /proc/scsi/scsi shows the device 
but only sorta:
> Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
>   Vendor:          Model:                  Rev:
>   Type:   Processor                        ANSI SCSI revision: ffffffff
whereas the LUN that is mapped shows up like this:
> Host: scsi1 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 01
>   Vendor: APPLE    Model: Xserve RAID      Rev: 1.20
>   Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
So since the information doesn't show up, the quirks table magic 
doesn't work since it doesn't know that it needs to do a sparse lun 
scan.
