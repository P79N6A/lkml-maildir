Hi,
I found something intresting (at least to me ;) in Linux TCP stack.
I don't know if it should be regarded a bug or not, or if it's known.
Anyway, this email is not meant to start flame of any kind (test results
are flamable material... ;)
So, it occurs in programs doing packet communication over TCP, when
peer waits for a packet to send an answer. If they send data with two
write() calls (for example to write packet header and packet data),
the performance dramaticly decrases (down to exactly 100 (2.2.19)
or 25 (2.4.[57]) packet exchanges per second on x86, from several
thousands. 100 seems to be related to HZ variable, see also AXP results,
where HZ is 10 times bigger).
Maybe example of code will tell more:
	struct header {
		int cmd;
		int len;
	};
	
	void send_packet(int cmd, void *data, int len)
	{
		struct header h = { cmd, len };
		write(fd, &h, sizeof(h));
		write(fd, data, len);
	}
is, let's say, 300 times slower then:
	void send_packet(int cmd, void *data, int len)
	{
		struct header h = { cmd, len };
		char tmp[BUFSIZE];
		memcpy(tmp, &h, sizeof(h));
		memcpy(tmp + sizeof(h), data, len);
		write(fd, tmp, len + sizeof(h));
	}
when running over loopback. Similar effects can be seen when running over
ethernet (the condition is, that next packet is requested only after
first one is recived).
I, personally, would expect the second version to be at most two times
slower (as there might be need to send two IP packets instead of one).
Also note, that as it is obvious that version with copying to buffer
on the stack should be faster, it is not so obvious if there is need to
malloc() buffer before sending (for example if there is no upper limit
on len).  However even if we need to malloc() buffer, second version is
still by orders of magnitude faster.
I don't know how many user space program does it impact. Probably not many,
as they often use buffering of some kind.
This is both true for 2.2 and 2.4, IPv4 and IPv6. One vs two writes doesn't
seem to make big a diffrence for unix domain sockets though.
I found it during work with client/server program that worked horribly
slow just becouse of this. (of course I fixed it, but that's not the point).
I tried to find it in kernel sources, but probably I didn't try hard enough ;)
I attach a test program and results of tests with few diffrent machines.
Test results follow. Please don't be suggested by diffrences between
2.2 and 2.4 as they might be results of kernel patches, also machines
other then roke were on heavy load. The only important thing, is that
two-writes-mode works at *constant* speed, indpenent of machine speed.
(to make things a bit sweeter I can tell that on fbsd 4.4 stable fragmented
writes go at 10 packets/sec, unfortunetly I don't have other machines to 
chceck right now ;)
