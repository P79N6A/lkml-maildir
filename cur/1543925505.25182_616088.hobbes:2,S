Now this is getting interesting. It looks to me as if you've implemented
a mandatory access control scheme that some people would like to be able
to use as a discretionary access control scheme. This is creepy after
seeing the MCS implementation in SELinux, which is also a DAC scheme
wacked out of a MAC scheme. Very interesting indeed.
