I tired to find the list linux-ipx first but it doesnt seem to be
functioning.  Does anyone know if the kernel will support passing through
IPX traffic from one NIC to the other?  I want to setup a firewall, and
couldnt find any information on firwalling my IP traffic and passing through
my IPX traffic.   What happens to IPX in the kernel if on one NIC is a
IPX/IP network and the other is an IP/IPX wan connection?
Any help or direction would be appriciated,
Gavin
