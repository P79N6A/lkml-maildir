Subject: [patch 08/30] fix UFS superblock alignment issues
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: Eric Sandeen <sandeen@redhat.com>
ufs2 fails to mount on x86_64, claiming bad magic.  This is because
ufs_super_block_third's fs_un1 member is padded out by 4 bytes for 8-byte
alignment, pushing down the rest of the struct.
Forcing this to be packed solves it.  I took a quick look over other
on-disk structures and didn't immediately find other problems.  I was able
to mount & ls a populated ufs2 filesystem w/ this change.
