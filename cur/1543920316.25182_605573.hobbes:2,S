Not so.  The git-scsi-misc.patch in 2.6.23-mm1 clearly adds the line:
    struct scatterlist sense_sgl;
as part of the added struct scsi_eh_save in scsi/scsi_eh.h.
This bit me while I was doing a bisection on 2.6.23-mm1, for another
problem, in git-sched, which is discussed in the lkml thread:
    git-sched patch won't boot on SN arch, 2.6.23-mm1
This is using sn2_defconfig.  The full 2.6.23-mm1 patch set builds ok,
because another patch, git-block.patch as I recall, includes
scatterlist.h some other way, but for the following range of patches in
2.6.23-mm1, on the configuration sn2_defconfig, the build is broken,
due to 'struct scatterlist' being an incomplete type:
    git-scsi-misc.patch
    git-scsi-misc-include-fix.patch
    git-scsi-misc-fixup.patch
    qla2xxx-printk-fixes.patch
    pci-error-recovery-symbios-scsi-base-support.patch
    pci-error-recovery-symbios-scsi-first-failure.patch
    nsp32_restart_autoscsi-remove-error-check.patch
    scsi-send-media-state-change-modification-events.patch
    scsi-early-detection-of-medium-not-present-updated.patch
    mptbase-reset-ioc-initiator-during-pci-resume.patch
    scsi-use-notifier-chain-for-asynchronous-event.patch
    initio-fix-conflict-when-loading-driver.patch
    git-block.patch

I don't know about the vanilla 2.6.23 case.
