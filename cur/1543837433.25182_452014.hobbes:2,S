Hello,
I'm using a Dell PE1800 and I've built a new 2.6.16.16 kernel on the machine
that works fine.  However, if I tar up /lib/modules/2.6.16.16 and /boot and
move it onto another Dell PE1800 running the exact same software (FC3/Stock
install) the new kernel doesn't boot.
On machine #1 life is good but moving it to machine #2, I get
/lib/ata_piix.ko: -l unknown symbol in module.
What am I missing?  Someone help please, I'm in a major time crunch!
Thanks!
:b!
