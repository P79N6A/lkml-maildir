My old monitor, Iiyama VisionMaster Pro 400, was meant to do this too, but it 
never worked.  It only ever went into power saving when the distro I had 
installed set this option during boot.  Up till then I'd simply believed the 
kernel config help where it mentioned not doing power saving and so never 
looked for the option!  Up to then I'd only had DPMS available through X.  
BTW, I assume you have screen blanking and power saving disabled by setterm 
when the monitor goes into power saving mode?
