Subject: [PATCH] Accept large ethernet frames to support VLANs (natsemi.c, against 2.4.17)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi All,
Here is my first shot at a kernel patch. It enables
accepting ethernet frames larger than 1518 bytes on
the natsemi DP83815 based ethernet cards (eg Netgear
FA311/Fa312), to support 802.1Q VLANs.
It seems to work for me, although I've only tested it
between two linux boxes running VLANs (both with
Netgear FA312 cards), rather than into a VLAN capable
ethernet switch, as I don't have one at home.
For any comments, suggestions or criticisms, please CC
me, as I'm not subscribed to the mailing list.
Thanks,
Mark.
