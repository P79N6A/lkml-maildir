Yep, you're right.  Adding readX() would definitely be the wrong thing
to do if we want to support PCI-X RO correctly.

I'll buy that.

I remember seeing discussion of the new API, but haven't read that doc
yet.  Since most drivers still use the pci_* API, we'd have to add a
call there, but we may as well make the two APIs as similar as possible
right?
