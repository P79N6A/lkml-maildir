Subject: unmounting a filesystem mounted by /init (initramfs)

I am trying to build a system that uses a unionfs as root. The init
script is based on the one used by gentoo and uses initramfs. The
problem is how to remount the unionfs constituents read only during
halt.
cat /proc/mounts displays /dev/hda1 (ext2) mounted rw in /memory. The
problem is that /memory is no longer visible after the init script did
a chroot and a
mount -o remount,ro /dev/hda1
says that /dev/hda1 is not mounted!
does any anyone has an idea?
Thanks,
Rafael
