Obviously.  The point is that using the hypothetical Microsoft
situation, Microsoft could devise a patch to the kernel which
does what they need, creating the interfaces/API's they need,
etc, and GPL it, releasing source.  Then write a BINARY only
module which calls their GPL'd API.  With their market clout, it
would be possible for this bastardized Linux version to rise in
popularity, possibly overtaking our standard kernel.
I can't see this happening anytime soon, but I wouldn't write it
off as a "it'll never happen".
At any rate, I was just expressing my opinion, nothing more, and
certainly not wishing to start flames.
Take care,
