The notion that the kernel itself should do no partition parsing at all 
was advocated by Andries Brouwer. I violently disagree. Anything that the 
lack of which makes a normal system basically unusable should go into the 
kernel.
Yes, the kernel rules are heuristics, but so would inevitably any 
user-level rules be too, so I don't want to move partition detection to 
initrd or similar.
