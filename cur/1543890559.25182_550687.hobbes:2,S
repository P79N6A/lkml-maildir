Mine's a 32 bit machine.

I haven't tried rc3 yet.

Not necessarily.  But you may need to do a number of trials as sheer 
chance plays a part.

I've always done it in run level 5 using gnome-terminal.  I use 10 
consecutive trials without seeing the problem as an indication of its 
absence but will cut that short if I see a 3/1 which quickly recovers 
(see below).

Yes, that (the fact that it recovers quickly) confirms that the problem 
isn't present for your system.  If load balancing occurs when other 
tasks than the spinners are actually running a 1/3 split for the 
spinners is a reasonable outcome so seeing the occasional 1/3 split is 
OK but it should return to 2/2 as soon as the other tasks sleep.
When I'm doing my tests (for the various combinations of macros) I 
always count a case where I see a 3/1 split that quickly recovers as 
proof that this problem isn't present for that case and cease testing.

I haven't tried that.
Do your spinners ever relinquish the CPU voluntarily?
