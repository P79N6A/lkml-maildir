I don't think this is a kernel issue but I'm also finding this message
in my log every 10 min. (Linus-2.2.16) I assumed this was a bind configure
problem perhaps brought on by using linuxconf but now I'm not so sure as
I can see no problem. Any ideas where I should look?
When I get to the office tomorrow I will revert to .15 just in case.
