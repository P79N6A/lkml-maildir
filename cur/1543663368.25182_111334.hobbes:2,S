Yes, I can connect the system via a gigabit switch, however I didn't run my 
testings with the boxes connected through the switch.

Two identical boxes connected back to back (Supermicro P4DPR motherboard, 
E7500 chipset, dual 1.8GHz, Intel Gigabit 82544GC onboard controller, please 
note that the PCI interface of the Gigabit controller only supports 
32bit/33MHz, 32bit/66MHz but that doesn't seem to mattter much). The data is 
being sent to and from the Gigabit controller. 
The software driver I am using is e1000, driver version 4.4.12-k1, 2.4.20 
kernel.

Server being the Supermicro P4DPR, client being the Tyan S2720 Thunder i7500. 
(The other way around doesn't seem to matter) On the Tyan, its got the Intel 
PRO/1000 XT Gigabit Server 82544EI onboard controller which supports PCI-X, 
64bit/133MHz 
The software driver is the same as above: e1000, version 4.4.12-k1
