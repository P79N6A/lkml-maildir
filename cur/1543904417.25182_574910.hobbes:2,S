Why? There's a drivers/ide/arm/ide_arm.c IDe driver that some platforms 
(not in the mainline) hack to access, e.g., CF cards in true-IDE mode. 
About a month ago I submitted a patch to arm-linux-kernel switching that 
driver to using platform-device. I got a reply, that it's not worth it now 
that IDE is slowly becoming obsolete, and the pata_platform serves the 
perpose perfectly well. I found this argument reasonable, I had the same 
doubt, just wanted to double-check. So, why do we now need a new legacy 
(a/drivers/ide/legacy/ide_platform.c) driver when a "modern" driver 
exists?
Thanks
