Hello,
Linux 2.3.13 (and some before) have a problem with the loopback
device.
I often test network applications that use the network for communications
by having both the client and the server on the same machine for testing.
This is no longer possible. The loopback device "throttles back" to
about one packet per second.
Is this being fixed or is it considered a DOS "feature". If it's a
new feature, we need a way to turn in off.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
