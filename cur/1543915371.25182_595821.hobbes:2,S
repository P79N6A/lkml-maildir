A first step would be to look for patches in -rt that add rcu_read_lock()
or friends.  A second step would be to look for rcu_dereference() without
an enclosing rcu_read_lock(), rcu_read_lock_bh(), or preempt_disable().
Beyond a certain point, this reduces to the problem of finding places
where spin_lock() was omitted, right?
