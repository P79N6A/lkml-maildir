Is the #ifdef necessary?  Such conditions around header includes often
indicate problems with the included header.  If that is the case here,
you should fix the header in question in a seperate patch.

This will cause some wasted space due to alignment.  There don't seem
to be other u8 or chars to consolidate with here, though.  Still, you
could take another look that your structures have fields on natural
alignment borders and don't grow without you noticing.

Yuck!  Do you have really good reasons to play such games?
