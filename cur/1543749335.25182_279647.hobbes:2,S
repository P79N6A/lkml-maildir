Subject: [PATCH 2/2] USB: avoid OHCI autosuspend on some boxes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Don't try autosuspend if we think the hardware won't resume correctly
from the OHCI suspend state.  This makes the RWC bit serve double duty,
but that appears to work OK, and the only penalty is increased power
consumption (from OHCI clocks) on boards/chips that don't work right.
For example, the amd756 erratum 4 workaround needs this logic; and at
least one ServerWorks box issues spurious resume IRQs (~3x/second!)
in the suspend state.
