Subject: Ping-pong on Hyperthread CPUs?

I have noticed that processes tend to ping-ping between the two
virtual CPUs in my Hyperthreaded P4 machine (kernel 2.4.20). I know
this would be bad on true SMP systems, but does it have any impact
with Hyperthread CPUs? Should I be worried?
Also, hardware interrupts all seem to be going to the first virtual
CPU. I assume this is intentional.
Thanks,
Dan
