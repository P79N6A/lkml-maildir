It's indeed true that &pt_regs is truly the esp value for x86-32
kernel-mode trap frames.  Because this nonobvious calculation is 
only right for a kernel mode pt_regs and not for a user-mode one,
I think it would be better to use a name for the inline/macro that
makes this quite clear, rather than one so generic as "stack_addr".

That was hpa, not me.  Harmonizing the signedness of the struct members
does seem to me like a reasonable and deobfuscatory thing to do.
But I don't plan to get involved in doing it.
Thanks,
