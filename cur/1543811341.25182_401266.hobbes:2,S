I have seen a set of drives that has reported UncorrectableErrors
and :
    * Shows the Uncorrectable error in the SMART log
    * Passes a full SMART test
    * Shows no remapped sectors
    * Passes the vendors drive test
    * Now fully passes a dd if=/dev/hdx of=/dev/null with no errors.
They were a set of 250GB SATA drives by the same vendor; I've taken
 them out one at a time as each did the same thing and replaced them
with another vendors drive.  They were all in use in RAID-1 MD 
configuration (under heavy load).
I do wonder about the 'uncorrectable error rate' that vendors report;
it doesn't seem very large - but I'll admit to not understanding its
units.  Are soft non-repeatable uncorrectable errors expected in
principal? (Pointers to a good explanation of what this actually
means would be appreciated).
I do wonder how often this happens to people and if the read succeeds
again they just blame it on software.
