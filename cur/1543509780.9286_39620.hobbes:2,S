This sounds bogus.

Normally in the TCP retransmit queue, but that should be really shown
in netstat. I guess scp's display is buggy.

It does not attempt to shorten a too long queue, it'll only drop new packets
that would exceed the queue limit.

The data is buffered by TCP when it does not get any ACKs back. When
some flow control problem (probably at driver level) prevents TCP from
seeing the ACKs it'll not free the retransmit queue.

This sounds like the device has dev->tbusy set. 
Could you repeat your tests which something that has a trustworthy
progress display?
