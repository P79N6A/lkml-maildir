As far as I remembers, Ubuntu uses klibc in initramfs, right?
What version of klibc do you have? There was a bug in klibc that causes 
such behavior on PIE-randomization-enabled kernels, and has been fixed in 
klibc-1.45 by commit [1]. Please make sure you have updated klibc version 
that doesn't contain this bug.
