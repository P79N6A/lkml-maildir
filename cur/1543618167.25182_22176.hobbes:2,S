Where? :) ptrace doesn't change pagetables, no need to flush any tlb in
ptrace.
Anyways if the problem is in the nvidia driver they may be really doing
an invlpg on a misaligned 4M page address for no good reason, this
sounds unlikely though.  What's certain is that the stuff into the
mainline kernel shouldn't really be affected for the reason you also
said previously (we never invalidate 4M pages with invlpg). In the very
worst case nvidia guys just need to mask the lower (not significant)
bits before passing the address to invlpg, which is going to be a one
liner.
