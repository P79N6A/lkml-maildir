yesterday Adrian Bunk noticed, that the commit
commit 42a73808ed4f30b739eb52bcbb33a02fe62ceef5
Author: Pavel Emelyanov <xemul@openvz.org>
Date:   Mon Nov 19 22:38:33 2007 -0800
is somewhat strange. Basically, the commit is obviously wrong as the
content of the /proc/net/raw6 is incorrect due to it.
This series of patches fixes original problem and slightly cleanups the
code around.
