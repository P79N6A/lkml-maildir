Are you using < 0.73 PAM without the change_uid pam_limit option? You
set in /etc/security/limits.conf:
*               soft    nproc           40
the '*' valid for users but not for root, the relevant parts of
a default login/pam works like:
<running as root>
setrlimit()
fork()
setuid(user_uid)
So if you have at least 40 root processes running already for whatever
reason then the result is what you see.
The livelocks what I mentioned is indeed different and fixed in 2.4.9 (I
guess the 'kswapd thought shortage for highmem zone when its size is
actually 0' issue what Linus said in the 'kswapd using all cpu for long
periods' thread). Sorry for the confusion, hope the above fixes your
problem.
