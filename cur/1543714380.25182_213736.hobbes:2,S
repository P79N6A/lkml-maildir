Either way, I personally would be extremely grateful for some kind of 
standard way to add a new configurable generic feature to every 
architecture.  I'm tired of having to add it manually.  I hadn't 
realized about the "source" feature--seems like we should be able to 
pull a lot of stuff into something like that even now.
On a side note, why is there no Kconfig for the "kernel" directory?
