I'm trying to update some of the code for the Alpha arch.  Seems that the
task_struct struct was changed, but the changes were not reflected in all
the platforms.
These two have nailed me so far:
task_struct->p_opptr
task_struct->p_pptr
What were they changed to, and is it just a one line fix, or is it more
involved?
