Dunno about the history.  Oh well, as long as the problem gets fixed.

Not sure whether it applies to sb600 directly but libata policy for this
type of situation is..
* always prefer the native / more capable (read ahci) interface over
emulated SFF interface.
* program the device and update PCI header using a PCI quirk such that
module loading order or BIOS setting doesn't affect which driver gets
attached.  Note that if the controller needs to programmed in specific
way, the quirk also needs to be called during resume.  In this case, the
function for SFF interface can simply be disabled.
Please take a look at the JMB quirk in drivers/pci/quirks.c in the
latest libata-dev#upstream tree for details.
Thanks.
