Do you think this patch would fix other problems as well?  I have
seen the keyboard hang a few times.  Unplugging the keyboard for
a second seems to fix it for me.  Maybe it is an unrelated
problem (it happends on NT as well).
I problem I have is that my keyboard randomly inserts "`"
characters.  It happends quite infrequently, maybe once every ten
minutes, but is `very annoying.  I am typing on this keyboard now
and as you can see it just inserted one (no joke).
I don't have to be typing for it to happen.  An open xterm
collects as most one ` while I am away (usually none).  I don't
know if using the mouse makes a difference.  It does seem to
happen more when I am typing.
The keyboard is a Dell QuietKey.  I have a PS/2 Intellimouse.
The kernel is 2.2.13.  This behavior does not occur with NT.
