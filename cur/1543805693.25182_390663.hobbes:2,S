Agreed, but that describes the current state of the kernel.
Using a task_struct for referencing kernel threads where there
is tight collaboration seems sane.  However using a task_struct
is impossible when referring to process groups, and it feels
like a bad idea to reference user space processes.
Basically my concern is that by using task structs internally
the kernel will start collecting invisible zombies.  And
with a case like struct fown_struct we could force RLIMIT_NOFILE task
structs into memory, per hostile process.  Usually this is much more
than RLIMIT_NPROC which limits the total number of live processes
and zombies a single user may create.
So assuming RLIMIT_NPROC == 100 and RLIMIT_NOFILE == 1024
Which means something like 100*1024*sizeof(struct task_struct) bytes
sizeof(struct task_struct) is somewhere between 512 and 1K bytes,
on a 32bit platform.
So 100*1024*512 to 100*1024*1024 = 50 to 100MB.
Being able to pin 100MB with modest ulimits does not sound like an
obvious fix to me.
Given what a hostile user can potentially accomplish I think anything that
approaches using struct task_struct pointers as a replacements for pids
should be approached carefully.
