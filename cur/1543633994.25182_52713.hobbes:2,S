The "code" is in timer.c (same place you found "add_timer())
and is called run_timer_list().  It is called by timer_bh()
also in timer.c, which is scheduled by do_timer() (also in
timer.c) which is called each timer interrupt by code in the
arch/kernel/ area (in i386 it is time.c) which, in turn is
called by the interrupt code.

The tried and true way is the setitimer() call.  The POSIX
calls are also available as a patch from the high-res-timers
project (see signature).
