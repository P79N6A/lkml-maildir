Hi again Linus, please pull from
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/aia21/ntfs-2.6.git/HEAD
This is another urgent NTFS bug fix which fixes an analogous problem to 
the previous one.  In the rush of getting out the previous patch I 
completely forgot there are two different code paths that lead to mft 
records being written out.  The previous patch addressed the inode dirty 
based writeout while this one addresses the page dirty based writeout.
Please apply before you release 2.6.13.  Many thanks and apologies for 
sending two merge requests in a row like this!
The diff style patch produced with git format-patch linux-2.6 is below.
Best regards,
        Anton

[PATCH] NTFS: Complete the previous fix for the unset device when mapping
      buffers for mft record writing.  I had missed the writepage based mft
      record write code path.
