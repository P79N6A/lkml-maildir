hm. There are no similar reports so far. Could you try to run the wine 
program from a VGA text console (first do 'xhost +' in an xterm under X 
and then 'export DISPLAY=:0' in the text console) and see whether 
anything gets output to that console? Also enable nmi_watchdog=2 - which 
could print a backtrace of the point of the hard lockup.
but in general there's nothing scheduler-specific about screensavers or 
wine - but it could be related to 3D mode of the chip (hence related to 
the nvidia module) - do you get a similar lockup if you try to run 
'glxgears'?
