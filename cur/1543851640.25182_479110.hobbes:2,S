I'm not sure anybody actually embeds a micro. There is some chip, originally 
make by National, that
was supposed to monitor the battery state. I know that I have used five 
laptops so far and have
never been able to obtain any intellegent operation. They just shut down 
when they feel like it.
They do go to "suspend" mode to save power as well, always at the most 
inopertune moment.
Maybe the "ThinkPad" actually has some intellegence within. The cost of the 
batteries only reflects
the cost of defending lawsuits <grin> and not the cost of its components. 
Batteries made in
China seem to become "excited" at inopertune times.
