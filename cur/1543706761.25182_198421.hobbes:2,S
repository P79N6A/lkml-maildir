I prefer going flipping back and forth rather than reading an uncomprehensible 
source. Simpler functions may be analyzed and debugged in a faster way. If
you dislike going back and forth by hand some tools could help you (think 
about cscope). Taking a look at the kernel code it's easy to realize I'm not 
the only one thinking so...
Moreover, if you take a look at the kernel code you'll realize that well 
written code usually defines inlines you really shouldn't need to read since 
their names are quite often self-explaining. Taken from CodingStyle "If you 
have a function that counts the number of active users, you should call that 
"count_active_users()" or similar, you should _not_ call  it "cntusr()"." 
Please don't think simply at those who are reading the code. Think about the 
persons which wrote that code which want to remember what they did two weeks 
before...

You could create a lot of examples where it's difficult to create an
inline.. but they're just examples! There are a lot of ways for writing
the same code and maybe if your example was taken from a real-life code
it could be written in a different and more easy-to-read manner.
