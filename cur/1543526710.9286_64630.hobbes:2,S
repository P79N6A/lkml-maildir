You want to remove SUID/SGID from trusted Linux ???? It'll be wrong move
IMO. SUID/SGID to "normal user" is not covered by capabilities!

Ok. We should implement kernel changes (capabilities in filesystem,
conpile-time selection and so on) and ask distribution makers to do the
rest (to convert userspace to new mode). Other way look like try to cut
cat's tail in parts (oh, I love my cat too much, I can not cut his tail in
one shot -- I'll do so in parts :-)... All proposed solutions to
"transition problem" are worse then problem itself.
