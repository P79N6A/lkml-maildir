Hi,
is there any hope of working combination of MULTIPATH with FC !?
At the moment I am using raid option multipath but it's one way
street, when one FC connection dies it successfully switches onto
another FC connection but when that second dies aswell, mount point
is in a limbo, no switching back to first FC connection.
Any other solutions, patches ?!
