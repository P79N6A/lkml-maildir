This server I inherited is a SUSE Linux box.  
Here is the eth0 device info: eth0      device: 3Com Corporation 3c905B
100BaseTX [Cyclone] (rev 24)
There is this reoccurring issue I am seeing in the /var/log/messages:
Mar  1 09:44:04 thor kernel: eth0: Transmit error, Tx status register
82.
Mar  1 09:44:04 thor kernel: Probably a duplex mismatch.  See
Documentation/networking/vortex.txt
Any ideas on how I can fix this issue, I have been all over google and
have not found a solution.
