Not that I know of.

The DMA stuff should work. The way the transparent ISA DMA emulation works
is horribly sick but OS independant. PCI bridges output all bus cycles
to the PCI bus first. Unclaimed ones go to the ISA bus. This means a PCI
card can watch ISA DMA being programmed and work out what the user was
trying to do. It then issues its own PCI DMA operations for the same
addresses.
