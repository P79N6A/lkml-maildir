Hi, Ingo , Mike and Peter!
    Just passing around to say that 2.6.23-rc8-sched-dev is the best
scheduler ever to me. It's great for 3D games.

 is really great with this
scheduler. I played a whole match without no slowdown, smooth playing
all the time. I had never played it before like this, it made a huge
difference to me. Even older CFS releases and -ck did not made it
sooooo smooth. It was really smooth _all_ the time.
    The scheduler team did a really good work on this!
Thank you so much for this great work,
