No. It's more like, in linux threads are visible to the kernel (unlike
in N:1 thread models, linux is 1:1). Threads are the basic unit of
scheduling.
A process can have >1 threads.

What do you mean by context?
Each thread has it's own stack, registers, etc. which form it's context.
A process has more info like file descriptors, IPC resources, virtual
