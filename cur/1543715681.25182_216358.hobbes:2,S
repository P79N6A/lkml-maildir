Hello World,
Since kernel 2.4.21 (or so), ACPI is recognised on my Toshiba Satellite.
Now with kernel 2.4.26, I've read the following lines in dmesg:
ACPI: Subsystem revision 20040326

I haven't had this error with kernel 2.4.25. Is this a known problem? If
there is a need for further information I'd like to help.
Best regards
	Andreas
