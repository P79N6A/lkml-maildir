Check out the code for "sys_reboot" in "kernel/sys.c" for ideas on how to do
this.  I don't think you can invoke "sys_reboot" from inside an interrupt
handler, but you could probably do the same thing by calling the service
routines "sys_reboot" does.
If that doesn't shut your machine down gracefully, then you might resort to
"call_usermodehelper" in "kernel/kmod.c" to run "/sbin/shutdown -h now".  You
can't invoke "call_usermodehelper" from an interrupt top half, but it should
work find from a tasklett.
