Not nonsense.

Not the highlighted portion of the sentence.  This clearly implies
that the author is talking about what happens *if the system
crashes*. Let me quote the proceeding sentence:

Really, I don't know what to add to this sentence.  Without
implementing partially ordered writes, this is a problem.  Now, even
the author admits that this is "unlikely" to happen, and practical
experience says that it is at best extremely rare.  Still, nothing
that the author said appears to be FUD or incorrect from what I know.

I guess that is your loss.
