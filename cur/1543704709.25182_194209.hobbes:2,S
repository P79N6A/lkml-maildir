Just a random thought: if I understand it correctly, CPU hotplugging is 
intended to be able to take CPUs online and offline one by one, am I 
right? Well, when that infrastructure's ready, this can probably be made 
to work for SMP by taking all the other CPUs offline first. They're all 
going to go offline because of the suspend anyway, so it shouldn't make 
much difference. :)
