No they have to consider the processor type, check the source/dest and allow
for the possibility of faults.
Roughly speaking it looks like this (although some of this vanishes for non
386 builds)
	check user address and user address+size are in user space, and that
	they don't wrap
	if the cpu doesnt has working write protect
		ensure the faults will be caught/cleaned up [compile time]
		copy the data
	else
		walk the VMA tree to ascertain the addresses are all mapped
		copy on write any pages needed
		copy the data
	fi
Except when you feed it junk, it becomes a straight copy on any decent CPU.

You don't want to find the physical address of a user space buffer. For
one thing the answer you get back may cease to apply at an arbitary point in
the future. Secondly you must deal with copy-on-write. The list of problems
continues from there onwards.
Stephen Tweedie is doing code to do this cleanly which will probably by for 
the 2.3.x kernel tree. Until then either map kernel space into the user process
as your DMA buffers (see the bttv mmap() operation or the sound drivers), or
don't play with fire
