Ignoring whether this is a good idea or not, under 2.6.15 you could run
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/fb0
which would clear the framebuffer. It would end up saying "dd: /dev/fb0:
No space left on device".
Under 2.6.16 (and a recent git kernel), the same command clears the
screen but then hangs. Was the change in behaviour intentional? 
I've noticed this on a couple of ARM based Zaurus handhelds under both
w100fb and pxafb.
