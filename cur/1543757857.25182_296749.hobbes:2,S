This makes sense to me. CSA can use the UNIQUE policy to enforce
its "can't escape from job container" philisophy.

I am not quite comfortable of ELSA requesting a fork hook this way.
How many hooks in the stock kernel that are related to accounting? Can
anyone answer this question? I know of 'acct_process()' in exit.c used
by the BSD accounting and ELSA is requesting a hook in fork. If people
raise the same question again a few years later, how many people will
still remember this ELSA hook?
That was the reason i thought a central piece was a good idea. I
would rather see the fork hook is coded in acct.c and then invokes
a routine that handles what ELSA needs. If CSA would adopt the ELSA's
daemon's approach, CSA may also need to use the fork hook.
Actually the acct_process() was modified not long ago to become
a wrapper, which then invokes do_acct_process() which is completely
BSD specific. The fork hook can be the same.
