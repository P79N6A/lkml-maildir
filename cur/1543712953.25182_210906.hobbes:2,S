Hmmm...well, I could collapse the two together, since commands_per_lun
is not limited by anything specific for this adapter.  I would prefer
to leave them broken out to handle users who have extreme requirements.

The SRP spec has two different buffer formats: SRP_DIRECT_BUFFER for a
single buffer, and SRP_INDIRECT_BUFFER for lists of buffers, and the
layout of the buffers in the request is different for those two cases.

Yes....that is one of the things that would drive you down that path.
There are a couple of places in the code where request_limit is explicitly
set to -1 to force all requests to be rejected.

Fair enough.

OK, two issues.  There are a bunch of SCSI LLDDs that use this same
logic in abort and reset handlers to wait for adapter events to
complete, so I think the logic is OK.  The issue of spin_lock_irq
vs spin_lock is a good one...and points out that there are a bunch
of LLDDs that are broke :-)  I'll resubmit without the _irq

Ya, copied from less sane operating systems.  I'll fix.

I'll fix.

This whole driver has to do with adapter sharing....and this answers
the question with whom you are sharing it.  Which may in fact NOT
be Linux.

Agreed...I'll walk either side of the street on that one.

Hmmm...above code copied from the qlogic driver...and it looked reasonable
to me, but I'll tweak it.

Because for iseries it is implemented in the pci code.  While it may
look wrong, it is actually correct.  Check out
arch/ppc64/kernel/iSeries_iommu.c and arch/ppc64/kernel/dma.c.
This device has to have dev->bus == &pci_bus_type otherwise the
dma_mapping_foo functions won't work correctly.
Thanks for the comments!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
