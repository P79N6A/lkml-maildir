You should know exact addresses which are blocked. It can not be done by bot
(bot can not distinguish blocked server and server with no SMTP server
installed yet). So it's done by humans and thus is vulnerable to unavoidable
pilot errors.

They are affected by pilot errors and by DNS's nature: it's not easy to
mark "netblock with few exceptions". So the only things possible is to
mark netblock and put exceptions in separate list. It's what being done.
Unfortunatelly only very few systems are using that separate list :-/

Noone is complaining about above.net servers :-) Unfortunatelly when ORBS
blacklisted above.net servers some "good" servers was (and is) blacklisted too.
