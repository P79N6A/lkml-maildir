Wouldn't it be _much_ nicer to just depend on that whole VM_NORESERVE 
thing?
Those hugetlb mappings _should_ have VM_NORESERVE on them, so the 
following test:
>  		if (!(oldflags & (VM_ACCOUNT|VM_WRITE|
>  						VM_SHARED|VM_NORESERVE))) {

should do it all correctly.
Why make up some ad-hoc testing, when we already have a flag for _exactly_ 
this issue. That's what VM_NORESERVE means: don't apply VM_ACCOUNT.
IOW, I don't see the point of this patch at all.
And if there is some hugetlb path that doesn't set VM_NORESERVE, then fix 
_that_ instead.
