Except that it isn't a directory. Good start :-)

Yup. It's HORRIBLE. Apart from anything else: If I copy one of these
"directories" to ext2 and back, how does NTFS "know" the "directory" it's
being handed is really supposed to be a file on NTFS, but a directory on
ext2? And how many sickbags will the users need when they see this?

File-like properties:
1. They are files.
2. They look like files.
3. They smell like files.
4. They taste like files.
The only distinction is that they share the [acm]time and permissions with
one or more other files of a similar name, under NTFS.

More than that: porting NT apps to Linux will need this support locally.
The NT apps will expect to be able to open these streams as
"filename:stream", without screwing with
pseudo-virtual-magic-directory-mount-point things.

No. If possible, the normal tools should work as expected.

Not critical, but very desirable.

I would doubt that: there are reasonable uses for it, and I can't see what
is "non-POSIX" about this feature.

s/clones/ports/. Having these features will make porting much easier. They
are also useful features in their own right.

Hang on - "structured" files?! Where on earth did that spring from? We're
talking about file-system file data attributes (i.e. files).

My approach avoids the need for ANY changes to tar & co. Much saner.

Structured files are a completely different issue - probably a userspace
one, too. FS-level streams are kernel-side, and another matter entirely.

I don't see the need for that sort of thing yet, but that's another issue
entirely.
