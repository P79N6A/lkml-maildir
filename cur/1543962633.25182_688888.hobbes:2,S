Ok, once again a good catch and a wrong fix, sorry:-) The bug is that not 
CONFIG_MT9M001_PCA9536_SWITCH but CONFIG_MT9V022_PCA9536_SWITCH shall be 
checked for, of course. Copy-paste:-( I'll prepare a correct patch and 
submit it. As for the "cleanup" side - don't know. Would it be better to 
unconditionally include it? It won't hurt of course, looks better, but is 
unneeded when the GPIO is not used. And, although grep reports most 
drivers including asm/gpio.h, including linux/gpio.h seems indeed better.
Thanks
