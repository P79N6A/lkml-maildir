Here's a short summary of what my plans for 2.6.22 are.  For
reference, everything is in my git tree:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/roland/infiniband.git
Please let me know if you have any thoughts on these plans, or if
there is something that you feel is missing from this list.
* mlx4 driver for new Mellanox ConnectX HCAs.  This is the connectx
  branch in git.  I will merge this soon, after a few more cleanups
  and one final posting for review.  There are actually two parts here:
  - "IB/uverbs: Export ib_umem_get()/ib_umem_release() to modules"
    This touches the core and all drivers, but I think it is a better
    design and actually helps other drivers too in addition to being a
    prerequisite for the mlx4 driver.  I haven't heard anyone speak
    out against it so I plan to go ahead and merge it.
  - "IB/mlx4: Add driver for Mellanox ConnectX HCAs"
    I'll fold all the mlx4_core and mlx4_ib code into this patch and
    merge it.
  - "mlx4_eth: Add 10 gigabit ethernet driver for Mellanox ConnectX"
    This will NOT be merged for 2.6.22 at least.  For one thing it is
    pretty much just a stub that doesn't do anything useful.  When
    there is working 10 gig support, I'll post this to lkml and netdev
    for review, but this is 2.6.23 stuff at the soonest.
* IPoIB NAPI work.  This is the ipoib branch in git.  Again, there are
  really two parts here:
  - "IB: Return "maybe missed event" hint from ib_req_notify_cq()"
    This extends the API in a way that lets us implement NAPI, but may
    be useful for other things too.  It touches all the drivers, and I
    still need to finish updating cxgb3 to work correctly.  I haven't
    heard anything negative about this, so I'll fix it up, post it one
    more time for review, and plan on merging it.
  - "IPoIB: Convert to NAPI"
    This is the actual conversion of IPoIB to use NAPI, based on the
    previous extension to ib_req_notify_cq().  There seems to be a
    need to merge this, based on people's experiences with congestion
    collapse under high load.  So I'm planning on merging this too.
* I also have the following bunch  of more minor patches queued, and I
  will ask Linus to pull them soon.  The majority of them are ipath
  fixes (and I hope Qlogic will send fixes for the two other bugs that
  I know of, namely corrupting the list of pending mmaps if an object
  is destroyed before userspace mmaps it, and doing spin_lock_irq()
  from interrupt context).  There are a few other cleanups and minor
  fixes scattered around.  Here's the shortlog of the for-2.6.22 branch:
