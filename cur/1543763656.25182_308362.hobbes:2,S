Actually, ioread8be is unnecessary, but I was planning to add
ioread16/ioread32 and iowritexx be on be variants (equivalent to
_raw_readw et al.)
After all, the driver must know the card is BE, so the routines that
make use of the feature are easily coded into the card, so there's no
real need to add it to the iomem cookie.
Did anyone have a preference for the API?  I was thinking
ioread32_native, but ioread32be is fine too.
