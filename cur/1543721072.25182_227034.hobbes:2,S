Subject: [PATCH - Trivial] Documentation - NFSv3 & v4 can't both be "the newer version"

In the kernel help for NFSv3 & NFSv4 client support both are listed as
"the newer version ... of the NFS protocol". Obviously both can't be the
newer version at the same time, so here's a patch to correct the text in
such a way that only v4 is listed as the newer version.
Patch is against 2.6.7-rc3 - please consider including it.
