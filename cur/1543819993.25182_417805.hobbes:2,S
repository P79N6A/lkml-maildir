When you grant CAP_SYS_ADMIN to a user, he can do _a lot_ of things. I wanted
to have the sub-admin have read rights in most places (e.g. nvram to pick a
random example), but not to have write rights. Unfortunately, read rights and
write rights for nvram both fall under CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
capable_x will call out to security_cap_extra(), passing it the current
function name as a string. An LSM module can then provide security_cap_extra
via the security_operations vector and decide whether to allow the request. I
primarily did this because it reduces the amount of recompiling needed. For
example, instead of having to add a ->nvram_allow_read and ->nvram_allow_write
hooks in include/linux/security.h -- which requires compilation of a lot of
parts -- I can simply use strcmp(func, "nvram_read") in the LSM. I agree that
this is not optimal, but having 1000 pointers in the security_ops vector is not
a solution either (-> code bloat).

I don't know, but there must be a reason uid_t and gid_t exist in the kernel in
the first place.
From a technical point, gid_t and uid_t are unsigned, while int is not.

Not without passing a handful of useless parameters (NULL or 0) to each
function.
As much as I would like to combine for example mt_sb_mount and mt_sb_pivotroot,
the prototypes are just too different.
Suggestions welcome.

The problem is that the base DAC logic is done after security_*(). Sometimes
that's good, most of the times, it leads to duplicated DAC logic because the
"usual DAC decision" is part of how multiadm decides.
Suggestions welcome too.
