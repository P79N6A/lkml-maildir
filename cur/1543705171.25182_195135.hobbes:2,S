Are you are talking about passing arguments to a function?  PPC32
passes long long arguments in two registers in the order you would
expect (hi, lo), BUT you have to use an odd/even register pair.  In
other words, if you have a function like this:
	int foo(int a, long long b)
then a will be passed in r3 and b will be passed in r5 and r6, and r4
will be unused.

Paul.
