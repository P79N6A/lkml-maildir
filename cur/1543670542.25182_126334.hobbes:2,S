Err, yes you should :-).
Unless they are spindle syncronised, the advantage of identical
physical layout diminishes, and the disadvantage of quite possibly
getting components from the same, (faulty), batch increases :-).

The advantage of RAID1 over a SLED is probably greater than the
advantage of RAID5 over RAID1.

I haven't had a drive failiure for a long time.  Maybe I'm just really
lucky.
