OK, the idea was to have the kernel keep the per-user
limits in kernel memory, with a (flexible?) configuration
file that's handled in userspace.
The kernel simply keeps the info for all UIDs with running
processes in memory and reuses the others in LRU order (so
that a user that gets lots of email doesn't cause the info
to be reloaded every few seconds).
The way to load the info into the kernel is probably best
done by a userland helper program that parses the config
file (in a flexible and easy format) and hands the data to
the kernel in a more rigid and compact format.
(just as we do now with loading modules)
regards,
Rik
