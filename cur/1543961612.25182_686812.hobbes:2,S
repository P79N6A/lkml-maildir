Ok, looks like I won't be able to do more testing than what I did today.
The sched-devel/latest tree has changes that break the out-of-tree DRM,
so I cannot test with Nouveau, and most likely the proprietary driver
will not work either. A very nice test would be to enable mmiotracing
as early in boot as convinient, but I don't know how to achieve that
with the ftrace framework.
I did notice two bugs in mmiotrace while looking at ioremap.c, so
I will follow here with three patches.
Tested with the patches and sched-devel/latest of

using testmmiotrace.ko and things looked fine.
Thanks.
