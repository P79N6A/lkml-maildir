   The caller's didn't need to stop packet processing, just remove their type
   from a list or some other call back hook.  A simple pointer update takes
   care of removing a simple call back. The list delete rcu code takes care
   of the memory barriers and doing the updates in the right order.
   This ensures no future packet processing will grab that token
Ok, I'm fine with this then.  Linus you can apply all of his patches.
