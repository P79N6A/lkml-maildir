Some comments over this thing would be nice.
The `wait' argument seems to be misnamed.  It typically points at
sync_page(), yes?   Maybe it should be called `action' or `kick' or
something.
If (*wait)() returns non-zero then it looks to me like the callers will get
confused, thinking that the page did come unlocked?
If (*wait)() returns non-zero then we need to run finish_wait(), no?
