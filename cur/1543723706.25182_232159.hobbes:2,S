The story on the more general one is that it silently broke -EFBIG
returns for 32-bit emulation. Arnd posted a patch to consolidate 32-bit
open() emulation, which I followed up with a hoist of the O_LARGEFILE
check to there above filp_open(). The forcing of O_LARGEFILE is still
needed for other, non-open()-related situations, and I may need to
sweep 32-bit emulation for other syscalls. Of course, it's a lose-lose
situation, as 64-bit now can't do internal kernel filp_open() on files
larger than 64-bit unsafe 32-bit apps can. In short, a large headache.
