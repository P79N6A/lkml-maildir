Incredible. I haven't tried the patches before since I experienced only
slight jerkiness - probably due to running a very light environment. No
desktop, only Enlightenment as wm. This on a PII 400. And no audio skips
in xmms (oss emulation of alsa).
Compiling 2.6.0-test1 with O10int first gave a definite smoothness when
browsing heavy pages with Opera 6.02. But the real surprise came when I
tried Baldurs Gate I under winex3. That oldie but goodie has been
impossible to play with all 2.4-s and 2.5-s (and plain -test1) due to
extreme jerks in sound, mouse and screen panning. Now... almost as
smooth as I remember it from a WinDos machine! With music and all the
sound effects! I'm almost speechless. What a job well done.
