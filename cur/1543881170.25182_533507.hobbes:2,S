Yeah, a 32768 Hz timer (battery backed) may leave a bit to be desired.

I'm not sure which patch you mean.  I tested only in conjunction with
updates specific to the at91rm9200.

My config didn't need it ... and ISTR that making a system support

Like the various arch/arm/kernel/* changes needed.  ISTR
there are several still in Russell's patch queue.
But basically, because I couldn't test such an at91sam926x
configuration.  That would be one of the "tweaks" that I
