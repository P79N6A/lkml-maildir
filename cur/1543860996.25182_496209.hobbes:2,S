Yes, we do not exclude any files from the kernel headers package, since
it is safer to have an extra file there than miss something that
something in userspace *could* need - or that is not needed now but can
silently become useful for something userspace in the future. An "all
headers part of the linux kernel" is much safer definition than "a
somewhat random selection of kernel headers".
