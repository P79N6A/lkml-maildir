Subject: [QUESTION] 2.4.3: hotplug_path unresolved in usbcore?

Sorry for such a stupid question, but I'm stumped (it doesn't take much).
modprobe reports that hotplug_path is unresolved when it processes
usbcore. CONFIG_HOTPLUG is defined, so it seems that hotplug_path is
defined and EXPORTed in kernel/kmod.c, so I'm unsure what the problem is.
Thanks, Ryan
