Subject: patch 1 / 3: fix broken documentation for bt8xx cards
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi folks,
although this patch is fine and necessary it has been blocked and ignored for months by the following so-called "maintainers"
who are a tall order and a shame for the whole linux community:
a. Manuel Abraham <abraham.manu@gmail.com>
b. Mauro Carvalho Chehab <mchehab@infradead.org>
I vote for excluding Manuel Abraham from maintainership, as we all need communicatable, reliable and accurate maintainers, no mismatches!
This patch fixes the documentation for dvb-bt8xx cards, synchronizing it to the actual state of kernel development.
Please sign-off or ack this only in connection with the DST deselection patch (i. e. patch 2 / 3)

+Please use the following options with care as deselection of drivers which are in fact necessary
+may result in DVB devices that cannot be tuned due to lack of driver support:
+You can save RAM by deselecting every frontend or DST module that your DVB card does not need.
+
+First please remove the static dependency of DVB card drivers on all frontend modules for all possible card variants by enabling:
+d.) "Device drivers" => "Multimedia devices" => "Digital Video Broadcasting Devices"
+ => "DVB for Linux" "DVB Core Support" "Load and attach frontend modules as needed"
+
+If you know the frontend driver that your card needs please enable:
+e.)"Device drivers" => "Multimedia devices" => "Digital Video Broadcasting Devices"
+ => "DVB for Linux" "DVB Core Support" "Customise DVB Frontends" => "Customise the frontend modules to build"
+ Then please select your card-specific frontend module.
+
+Do you use one of the following cards?
+1. Twinhan DST (FTA and CI) family (DVB-S/C/T/ATSC)
+2. Pinnacle PCTV SAT CI
+3. Chaintech DST-1000
+4. DNTV Live !
+
+If not you can save additional RAM by enabling:
+f.)"Device drivers" => "Multimedia devices" => "Digital Video Broadcasting Devices" => "DVB for Linux" "DVB Core Support"
+ "Bt8xx based PCI Cards" => "Customise DST support" => "Customise DST modules to build"
