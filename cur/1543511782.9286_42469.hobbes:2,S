Debian's glibc includes the kernel headers it was built with directly in
/usr/include/{linux,asm,scsi}. Further more the config is installed as
/boot/config-2.2.x. Note, this is with slink and potato. And yes the
source.deb does include the config used for the stock kernels. Each arch -
i386, sparc, alpha, ... - has a seperate patch package that installs over
the pristine source so you can get the config and diff used to compile
that kernel.
