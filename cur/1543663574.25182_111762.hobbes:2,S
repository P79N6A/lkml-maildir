Hi,
 I have some strange problems here:
 My kernel is prompting me with teh following message:
 Feb 23 04:56:19 solfire kernel: PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A
 of device 01:00.0.
 The according device seems to be:
 (cat /proc/pci...)
  Bus  1, device   0, function  0:
    VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon 7500 QW (rev 0).
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Min Gnt=8.
      Prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe0000000 [0xe7ffffff].
      I/O at 0xa000 [0xa0ff].
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xed000000 [0xed00ffff].
 
 And something, which seems to be of the same kind is a report from
 my XFree86 4.2.99.3-Server:
 (II) RADEON(0): [drm] failure adding irq handler, there is a device
 already using that irq
 [drm] falling back to irq-free operation
 What is going on here ? I checked the BIOS of my motherboard but
 found nothing suspicious.
 My system:
 Radeon 7500 64 MB DDR (Sapphire) on AGP
 Epox 8K5A3+  (VIA KT333)
 Atlon 2400+
 256 MB DDR RAM
 Any help VERY appreciated, since my XFree will not work in
 DRM-mode. Everything is slow motion....
 Thank you very much in advance !
 Keep hacking!
  Meino
