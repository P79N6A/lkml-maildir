Subject: [PATCH 3 of 4] struct path: Move struct path from fs/namei.c into include/linux
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/18/466

From: Josef "Jeff" Sipek <jsipek@cs.sunysb.edu>
Moved struct path from fs/namei.c to include/linux/namei.h. This allows many
places in the VFS, as well as any stackable filesystem to easily keep track
of dentry-vfsmount pairs.
