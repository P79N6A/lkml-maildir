Matt is correct about crypto/crc32c.c -- that should be simply "GPL".
As for the derived-from-public-domain-CRC32 stuff, should one even
claim "GPL" on it?  That would be, in effect, licensing public-domain
code and placing restrictions on it, something only a copyright holder
should be able to do, and not the intent of the author, in this case.
