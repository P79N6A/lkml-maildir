About the space saving? Not me, of course. It's just that I didn't see
any other advantage.

The only way of having a sane indentation using tabs is to make sure
that ALL indentation are tabs, not a mix of tabs and spaces (spaces, if
any, should be at the end of indentation for aesthetical purposes, but
should be removed without the logical indentation being lost). A good
editor can ensure that all indentation are tabs and not a mix, but a
good editor can adapt indentation to your likings when loading the file
and save the file translating your favourite indentation back to spaces
or whatever.
If everybody used tabs correctly, indenting using tabs would be great,
but IMHO indenting with spaces is much better.
