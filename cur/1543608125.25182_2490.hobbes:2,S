I'd rather object for now. I've had a couple of hard freezes within
minutes to hours after jiffies wraparound. Also some KDE applications
behave strange, the KDE panel and kterm need approx 2 min to appear
even before the wraparound (so it seems to be a sign issue rather than
wraparound). I don't want to see this in a stable kernel.
However, I would be pleased if widespread intentional use of the patch
would help to solve the remaining wraparound issues.

Yes, cut and paste error, sorry. And I wanted this patch to be final for
today...

I don't have enough knowledge of the kernel to find good places.
Any suggestions?
