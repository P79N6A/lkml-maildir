I just had lunch with someone that knows a lot more about the e100
driver than I do.
I would be curious to know what happens if you disable CONFIG_PM (as
seen in your .config), disable the eepro100 driver, re-enable the e100
driver, and then try kexec again.
The hint I received is that the e100_suspend() routine could call
pci_set_power_state() on the way down during a kexec, and that could
leave the card in a state that is difficult to resurrect when the new
kernel starts initializing devices.
You might also try commenting out the pci_set_power_state() lines in
e100_suspend() and leave CONFIG_PM enabled (untested diff for
illustration):
