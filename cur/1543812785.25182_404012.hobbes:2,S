I'm not sure what it is you are saying.  Directories may be renamed, but
the inodes are never moved.
The reason that directory inodes are spread across the disk is that this
allows later balancing of the file inodes that are created within each
directory.  If all of the parent directories are kept in the same group,
you would just end up having all inodes at the start of the filesystem
in use, with high fragmentation and no locality between directories and
the files created therein, and similar problems with inode blocks.
Cheers, Andreas
