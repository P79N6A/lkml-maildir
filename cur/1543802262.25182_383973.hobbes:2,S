Subject: [PATCH 10/11] kbuild/xfs: introduce fs/xfs/Kbuild
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/9/352

In kbuild the file named 'Kbuild' has precedence over the file named
Makefile. Utilise a file named Kbuild to include the 2.6 Makefile for xfs
- since the xfs people likes to keep their arch specific Makefiles separate.
With this patch xfs does no longer rely on the KERNELRELEASE components to be global.
