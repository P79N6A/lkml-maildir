Yeah, but they're still handy from time to time.  It's certainly quicker to 
pop a disk in and type "mdir", than to put it in, type "mount /floppy; ls 
/floppy; umount /floppy" or similar.  You get the picture.  Not that you 
don't have a valid point, too.

If I'm not mistaken, and I think has already been mentioned somewhere before 
in this thread, these interrupts where determined to be unreliable under some 
circumstances.  Anybody remember the details?

That's basically what I'd propose "mopen" do...  Hold it open 'til the user 
does a "mclose".  Of course, if you yank the disk out in the middle, all bets 
are off.
