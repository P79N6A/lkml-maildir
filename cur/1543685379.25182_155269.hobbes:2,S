What problems are we talking about? :-)

What is a value of having these two identities
(other than questionable debugging aid which can be implemented
differently)?

Yep, this is no longer used.

We are updating drive->id for changing DMA modes,
should this be "fixed" as well?

Yep, I think BLKGETSIZE should be used for such usages.

This is a contradiction if geometry of disk was changed cause
disk reported to us geometry data second time.
