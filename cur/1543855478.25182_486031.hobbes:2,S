Indeed.  That's what I said.  But I also pointed out that the field is 
only useful in simple minded programs and certainly not in the wrappers 
the runtime (glibc) will provide.
As you said yourself, there is no real need for the value being there, 
userland can keep track of it by itself.  So, let's reduce the interface.
