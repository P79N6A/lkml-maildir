Since you didn't mention it I assume you haven't tested the ide cables. 
Did you try changing the cables?
I myself have been experiencing problems that were related to a faulty
ide cable which looked fine on the surface. The kernel will try
resetting ideX continuously causing (in my case) filesystem corruption
in the end... It's not a pretty sight.
