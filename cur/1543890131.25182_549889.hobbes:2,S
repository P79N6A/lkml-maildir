Definitely, and it was a royal pain to trace the bug that this
caused.  An initial ramdisk having pieces disappear after mkfs
is called can look like the entire machine is dying.
When we initialize the ramdisk by writing to /dev/ram0 usually in
init/do_mounts_rd.c we don't allocate buffer heads but we do set
the dirty bit, and the page is in the page cache.  So when we
later call getblk it reuses the same page and then calls
init_page_buffers.

No.  I don't know where accounting comes into play.  I didn't
trace that path.  But if we have a non-dirty ramdisk page with
buffers (basically a hole in the middle or at the end of the ramdisk).
We need to set the buffer dirty bits when we write to it.
So I don't see how it would make sense to reuse the generic
set_page_dirty, and handling all of the logic in set_page_dirty
to dirty the buffer heads seemed to have made the most sense.
