Oh, I'm not alone ;) Well, up to now it _seems_ that ext3 is saving my day,
but it only happened two time after I upgraded to 2.4.19-pre8-ac5, none after
I upgraded to 2.4.19-pre9-ac3, but I can't manage to make 'hdparm -X68 /dev/hdd'
to work :( I have already sent detailed information to Andre and discussed
and tried several things sugested in a irc chat.
Short description: I use ext3 over raid0, using /dev/hda4 and /dev/hdd1,
/dev/hdc has a CDRW drive, mostly unused, /dev/hdb has nothing, two times
/dev/hda stopped responding, not reproducible AFAIT.
