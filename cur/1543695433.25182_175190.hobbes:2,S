Wow, this is an excellent bug report.
Yes, it looks like I will need to use a Promise-specific reset
mechanism, rather than one of the three generic mechanisms:
EXECUTE DEVICE DIAGNOSTIC (no flags), ATA software reset
(ATA_FLAG_SRST), and Serial ATA COMRESET (ATA_FLAG_SATA_RESET).
I would prefer to switch both VIA and Promise drivers over to
ATA_FLAG_SATA_RESET.
