	Hi Linus, Andrew,
Here are a few m68k-specific patches for 2.6.23-rc2:
   [1] m68k: <asm/page.h> needs <linux/compiler.h>
   [2] m68k: Kill superfluous extern
   [3] m68k: Remove unnecessary m68k_memoffset export and init
   [4] remove dead code in via-pmu68k
   [5] m68k: Use _AC() instead of #ifdef __ASSEMBLY__
   [6] m68k: Enable arbitary speed tty support
   [7] m68k: Don't include RODATA into text segment
   [8] m68k: Fix a few hickups in drivers/scsi/Kconfig
   [9] zorro: Make sysfs `config' attribute read-only
  [10] m68k/mac: Make mac_hid_mouse_emulate_buttons() declaration visible
Please apply, thanks!
Andrew: I know #10 is already in your tree, but as its omission breaks the m68k
build for Macs, I'm sending it to Linus directly.
Gr{oetje,eeting}s,
						Geert

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
