Yeah, my point wasn't that we need to drop it because Windows dropped it, it 
was just a data point backing up the claim that IP 1394 isn't very widely used.
And as for gap count optimization, I just added that to my git repo.  I 
thought about adding it before sending out these patches, but I was running 
late on getting them out -- I ended up spending too much time chasing down a 
stupid spinlock recursion.  It is pretty simple to implement in the new stack, 
since we have all the topology information available.  I did a quick, 
unscientific benchmark (md5summing 10 32M files) and the optimization is 
definitely noticable.  This is  a setup where the box and the disk are both 
connected to a hub so the max hops is 2, so we're using gap count 4:
	real    0m10.021s
	user    0m1.435s
	sys     0m0.356s
compared to no optimization, ie gap count 63:
	real    0m14.537s
	user    0m1.390s
	sys     0m0.402s
Though I see that Mac OS X uses a more conservative setting for a similiar 
topology, so maybe we need to add a bit or "margin" to the numbers from the 
table from 1394.

Exactly.  It's a cool hack (it's mentioned briefly in appendix E.1 of the 
PCILynx functional specification) and it would be fun to make it work, but I 
don't really see a userbase here.  And if somebody has a PCILynx card and want 
to use the new stack, I'll trade them for a OHCI controller :)  I have a much 
more useful way to put PCILynx cards to work using my firewire sniffer 
(
