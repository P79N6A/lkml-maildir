yes it is. Go to the openbios web page and follow the link to devbios.
The reason for dos-mode flashers is quite ugly, I can get into it if
anyone cares. But it's gross.
funny but true: support guy at intel tells me they now have to ship disks
that unpack a dos-image to a floppy, not just unpacks files to a bootable
dos floppy, since so few people can format a floppy that boots dos
anymore. They're running NT or something else.

Are you talking about BIOS flash memory or CMOS ram? CMOS ram is easy.
Flash is easy on many boxes. Flash is very hard on certain motherboards
(L440GX+ :-) because Intel is hiding something. They told me so in person
:-)
