First, that's obviously not the proper way to do a PCI driver but I
suppose you know that :-)
Then, make sure you call pci_enable_device() at one point, don't some
platforms perform the actual IRQ routing that late ? (And don't sample
pdev->irq before the pci_enable_device(), sample it afterward).
Cheers,
Ben.
