Dave, the only reason I figured it could have been Gerard's driver is
because previously I was using the AIC7xxx driver with a 2940uw and I did
not have the pyxis errors.  I moved to a sym based 53c800 card and thats
when the errors began to happen.  
It could that there is a 164SX specific error.  I might try compiling the
kernel as a 'generic' kernel.  If that does fix the error then something
with the 164SX specific code is wack.
Anyway Gerard has done a lot of work and I thank him!
Take it easy,
