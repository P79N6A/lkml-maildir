Thank you for your comments.

This is way easier IMHO, and totally preserves from the burden of meta-data 
versus plain-data encryption. However there is one big drawback: you benefit 
from encryption only when using the file-system for which you have such a 
plugin (for example, you can _not_ do a RAID5 array over encrypted disks).
I believe this is too much of a drawback, put perhaps I am wrong.

This is the idea I have in mind, but with a little more sophisticated scheme 
(see my reply to Paulo Marques): basically the sole purpose to "compress" is 
to improve the per-bit entropy, and you can mix this with adequately 
inserting random bytes before your data according to your compression 
algorithm.

Actually I would have used the counter-argument to prove your point ;)
Let me explain : I believe (but I am no cryptographer) that it is a very 
unwise idea to encrypt both data and meta-data at the same time. I prefer 
extracting all meta-data, possibly encrypting them somewhere, and encrypt 
data independently. This is basically because you can easily gain information 
on meta-data (but not so easily on data themselves). This is the reason why 
encrypting at the file-system level (where you encipher the content of files) 
is better than at the device level (where you also encrypt meta-data; this is 
however what I plan to do).
To follow your example, I would even prefer the offsets of the 2 or 3 files be 
public rather than having them encrypted and let the attacker know that the 
first 8 bytes of my sector encodes for offsets for 2 files, each of which 
being less than 4096 (thus having many 0 bits inside it) : this might 
tremendously help him reduce his search space.
But I do agree that encrypting at the file-system level might be a better 
approach. However I believe this raises two issues:
1) you may want to also encipher the meta-data itself. A basic way to do this 
would be to additionnaly use dm-crypt.
2) you can only profit from encryption with the file-system it has been 
implemented for.
I personally have no political stance on wether developping a Reiser4-only 
compression+encryption plugin would be unwise. I just loosily believe that it 
is always better to support several FSes. Unless, of course, if this is 
doomed to failed, which is the question I would like to answer before working 
further on it.
What to you think ?
Guillaume.
