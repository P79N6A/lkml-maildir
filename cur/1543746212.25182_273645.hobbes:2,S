Good. Yeah, the only piont I was making is not to cover up contention
problems, which are kernel performance problems with PI. That's all.

Yeah, I agree. PI has it's place, but the main point of the paper is
that getting a really good PI protocol is a very difficult thing and
might not be worth it if you can use other techniques. What you do with
that assertion is situational.
A number of those complaints, as I see it, don't apply to Linux because
of how it's avoided things like deadlocking, fine grainedness, etc... are
done. But he does, IMO, outline the difficulty of getting a decent PI
implementation.

Yeah, that's my point. The reason why/if/when Linux will be strong at RT
is because of the SMP work.
