TS = Time Slice
What needs to be changed is the 1TS per pass through the active array
concept. 
Devide the time slice into smaller Time Units, so that you can add one unit
per priority level.
TU = Time Units
Then you account these TUs instead of slices.
so, if nice -19 has 1 TU, and nice -19 has 40 TUs (maybe ranging from 1ms -
200ms with a TU of 5ms).
So nice -19 can have a long time slice and run until it expires if it
doesn't get preempted.
The more I think this through, the harder it gets to take this concept to
completion, but the basic idea is to have multiple TSes per slice, and to
account on TSes as well as slices.  That way, you have longer slices for
nicer tasks, but I'm not sure how it would fit into the two array scheduler
we have now.  You'd have to have another list for the processes that are
have used up their slice, but haven't waited long enough for them to get
another slice (because you want to give more total CPU percentage to the
higher priorities, while still giving them smaller slices).
Anyway, if anyone can take this idea and make it into a working scheduler,
I'd be most interested in the results...
