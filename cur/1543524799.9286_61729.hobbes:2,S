Personally I prefer libsvga, I don't find Doom very playable under
X (the traditional doom keys - Ctrl, Alt, Shift, cursor <>^v get in
the way of my window manager. Plus the mouse gets in the way)
But more fundamentally, surely if libsvga is broken, it should be
fixed? I shall try to fix this over the next few days...
