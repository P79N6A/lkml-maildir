I use mostly xterm, Emacs and netscape, so there's not much I need to
configure :-)
Like text mode, but with colour (Emacs) and the ability to fire up the
occasional PDF viewer and web page.  Quite handy.
I do have the colours all arranged to resemble text mode: grey on black,
bold using white on black instead of a font change.  The font I use is
9x15bold for most things.  A great font on CRTs, especially in grey75 on
black.
I'm sure that's the principal reason so many prefer text mode to X --
the colours and fonts are so "windowy" and not at all suited to the CRTs
they're displayed on.
