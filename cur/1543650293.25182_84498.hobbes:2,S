Hello,
With 2.5.44 I have encountered DMA errors when using my cdrom device. In 
2.5.40 it worked fine.
cdrom:
/dev/hdc:
 Model=SAMSUNG CD-ROM SCR-2438, FwRev=zd023, SerialNo=
 Config={ SpinMotCtl Removeable DTR<=5Mbs DTR>10Mbs nonMagnetic }
 RawCHS=0/0/0, TrkSize=0, SectSize=0, ECCbytes=0
 BuffType=unknown, BuffSize=0kB, MaxMultSect=0
 (maybe): CurCHS=0/0/0, CurSects=0, LBA=yes, LBAsects=0
 IORDY=on/off, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, tDMA={min:120,rec:120}
 PIO modes: pio0 pio1 pio2 pio3 pio4 
 DMA modes: sdma0 sdma1 sdma2 mdma0 mdma1 *mdma2 
 AdvancedPM=no
removable ATA device, with non-removable media
Standards:
        Likely used: 1
Configuration:
        Logical         max     current
        cylinders       0       0
        heads           0       0
        sectors/track   0       0
        bytes/track:    0
        bytes/sector:   0
        LBA user addressable sectors = 0
Capabilities:
        no IORDY
        Cannot perform double-word IO
        r/w multiple sector transfer: not supported
        DMA: not supported
        PIO: pio0
IDE chipset:
00:07.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82371AB/EB/MB PIIX4 IDE (rev 01) (prog-if 
80 [Master])

Errors when trying to read some files from a disk:
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00, sector 0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:00, sector 0
hdc: drive_cmd: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
hdc: drive_cmd: error=0x04Aborted Command 
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: DMA interrupt recovery
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: status timeout: error=0x00
hdc: DMA disabled
hdc: drive not ready for command
hdc: ATAPI reset complete
Buffer I/O error on device ide1(22,0), logical block 146
ide-cd: hard_nr_sectors differs from nr_sectors! 248 252
As a result, trying to read anything from the drive results in a sort of 
'lockup' of the drive, while it tries to get the data but constantly fails. 
The only way to get out of this deadlock is by rebooting the machine.
