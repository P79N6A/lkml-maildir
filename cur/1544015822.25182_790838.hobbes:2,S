That's fine, the ctor associated with the kmem cache is called, and in
the case of idr, it does a memset().

That's valid use of the idr interface, idr_get_new_above() won't block
or allocate, just return -EAGAIN if the idr_layer struct allocated by
idr_pre_get() got snatched up in between the two calls.  My complaint
was that in many cases you don't need to access the idr from interrupt
context and you can then just put the idr_pre_get() and
idr_get_new_above() under one big mutex.  Even so, many people just
copy-n-paste the boiler plate code that does the
idr_pre_get()/idr_get_new_above()/if(EAGAIN) goto retry sequence.
cheers,
Kristian
