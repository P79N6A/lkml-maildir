Oh yes it has :).  The warnings are because the timestamp on the loaded
module is not the same as the timestamp on the object file in
/lib/modules, something changed after the modules were loaded.  Running
insmod_ksymoops_clean (from the modutils package) after /var is mounted
will (a) delete older entries and (b) take a new snapshot for later
reference.  Also where did the call trace and code lines go to in that
oops?
