Actually it may be broken, depending on use. In some cases this loop
may want to poll the hardware 50 times, 10msec appart... and your loop
can poll it only once in extreme conditions.
Actually your loop is totally broken, and may poll only once (without
any delay) and then directly timeout :-P -- that will break _any_
user.
