No. Your patch makes it not ever free the pmd entries, as far as I can
tell.
I think you're on to something, but I think your patch just hides the real
problem.

No. We want to free the "superset", not the subset. Think of somebody just
mapping a single page in a 4MB area: when it gets unmapped, the code will
try to unmap the pmd too. With your change, that no longer happens.

Your second larger patch essentially does the old thing, and misses the
reason for trying to do this in the first place: getting rid of stale
pmd's that aren't used anymore.. And yes, it simplifies the logic, but it
also opens us up to some really simple out-of-memory attacks (ask Alan
about them).
