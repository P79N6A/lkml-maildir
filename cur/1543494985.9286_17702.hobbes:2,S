Well, using the current methods have transformed Linux from twenty
or so source files, support only for 386 and IDE drives, truly bad
performance and no TCP/IP, into this kernel that's being seriously
considered as a viable replacement for commercial kernels and even
for embedded systems.
So your suggestion sounds a bit like "don't do what works, instead
do what the text books say". Why change what is working?
You might like to consider Linux as an "experiment" in distributed
software development. Linux encourages multiple redundant attempts
to achieve the same goal. Users are used to test code, rather than
traditional regression testing or faked test environments. There's
no design, no road path, no authority except popular consensus.
Yet surprisingly these attributes - traditionally seen as the best
ways to waste money or kill software projects - seem to be exactly
what keeps Linux popular. Redundant projects compete, so unpopular
projects die. Users provide orders of magnitude more diversity for
testing. No design or road path allows Linux to adapt quickly.
Linux isn't an efficient development model, but humans aren't very
efficient animals. The chaotic nature of Linux keeps it strong. If
you imposed a different model I suspect you'd kill it.
