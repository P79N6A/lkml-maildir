I can suspend without oopses.  Yeh!
However, during the boot '2419p5a3 resume=/dev/hda6'  it oopses right
after saying a couple of things about not being able to determine
blocksize.  I'll photograph the repeatable oops and get it to you
when I have access to my camera again.  Probably in the next
24 hours. 
Do I need APM compiled into the kernel?

The US was never a democracy.  It was a constitutional republic.
Be that as it may, Thomas Hobbes wrote that there are only three
kinds of governments: Monarchies, Democracies, and Aristocracies.
All the rest of kinds and types are just versions of those already
mentioned.  The US is not a Democracy by any definition
so clearly I cannot choose the glass in front of me...
While the country may aspire to be a constitutional republic,
it seems to operate by the golden rule mixed with a bit of 
thuggery, so clearly I cannot choose the glass in front of you...
Are there countries that operate differently?
