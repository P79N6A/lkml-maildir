Hmm...You mean, the automatic colouring of the next line when the
terminal scrolls while a background colour is active?  Hmm...that's a
tricky one. :) Hmm...Perhaps the console code right now doesn't take into
account the high intensity (sometimes blinking) bit when it clears the
next line.  I guess it wouldn't break anything if it did regardless of
the VGA state, as an empty line with the bit enabled in blinking mode
won't show anything blinking, so making this change shouldn't harm
anything.
I tried digging through the console code to see if this is the case, but
the multiple function pointers with hard-to-grep names are making my head
hurt.  Maybe somebody else more experienced with the code can check this
out.
