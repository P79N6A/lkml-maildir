As Eyal Lebedinsky already mentioned
 init_task_union 
is not defined when creating scsi_mod.o
Here's a little more info that I gleaned by looking at
the preprocessor output of scsi_error.c
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 \
    -fomit-frame-pointer -D__SMP__ -pipe -fno-strength-reduce -m486 \
    -malign-loops=2 -malign-jumps=2 -malign-functions=2 -DCPU=686 -DMODULE \
    -E scsi_error.c 
in /usr/src/linux/include/asm/pgtable.h
the macro for_each_task is used in set_pgdir
  for_each_task is defined in include/linux/sched.h as
   #define for_each_task(p) \
    for (p = &init_task ; (p = p->next_task) != &init_task ; )
 [ set_pgdir is not called, so this probably isn't the problem ]
and the macro init_task in scsi_error_handler  
  defined in include/*/processor.h as (init_task_union.task)
Seems like the problem is in the following lines in scsi_error_handler()
of scsi_error.c:
        /* Become as one with the init task */
        exit_fs(current);       /* current->fs->count--; */
        fs = init_task.fs;
        current->fs = fs;
        atomic_inc(&fs->count);
 
How are modules supposed to access kernel data in init_task_union?
