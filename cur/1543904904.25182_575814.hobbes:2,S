The interface for inotify requires you to explicity watch files and folders.
As Ray suggests, I am also skeptical that using inotify to watch 18k of inodes
is very efficient, although it would be nice to be wrong. Possibly someone
needs to take a peak into OS X's fsevents mechanism?
The other problems with this approach is that the locate DB uses incremental
encoding. Each change to the filesystem may require large protions or possibly
a complete re-encoding of the database. An alterntive DB format would need to
be considered.
