Hi,
I have a 40GB harddisk . I copied four  8GB harddisks onto the 40GB harddisks using dd at offsets of 9GB.I know the exact offset where i copied onto the 40GB harddisk.
	The 8GB harddisks boot by themsevles ie they each have a partition table and linux kernel.
	The problem is that i have to boot these four harddisks seperately.I don't want to build partitions.Can i boot these images using offsets using lilo or grub. I mean i get a grub menu then i choose offset=9GB and i boot the second 8GB harddisk.
	Is it possible ?
Thank you
