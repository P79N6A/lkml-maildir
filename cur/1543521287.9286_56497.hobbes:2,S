Oopses in kernel 2.2.14.
Yes, it's built with gcc-2.95.2 but I don't think that matter in this case as
I have experienced practically identical oopses with 2.2.13 and 2.2.14pre
built with various compiler versions I tested (gcc-2.7.2.3, egcs-1.1.2).
My experience shows that these oopses ususally kills something under XFree86
(kwm, maudio). Sometime also XFree86 freezes with corrupted screen (usually 
small upper part only).
Earlier I did more experiments with 2.2.13 (and following 2.2.14pre versions)
using egcs-1.1.2 and gcc-2.7.2.3 and got practically identical oopses (in
average once per day when running XFree86) also then. 
I'm using XFree86 3.3.5 and Mach64 X-Server on ATI 3D Charger (Rage-IIc)
with 2M of video memory.
