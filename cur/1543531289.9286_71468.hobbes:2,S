The fast nat code in 2.2 does static NAT just fine. Since the docs are
thin here is a config from around here: (outside adress premangled for
posting)
#Translate 10.10.72.1<->166.123.16.129
/sbin/ip rule add from 10.10.72.1 nat 166.123.16.129 table main
/sbin/ip route add nat 166.123.16.129 via 10.10.72.1 table local
It can also do ranged static nat, and other strange things.
