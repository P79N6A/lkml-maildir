OK.. That booted just fine, didn't hang in pty_init, didn't hit the
WARN_ON added to fs_inoce.c.
So we have:
works:
#  CONFIG_FB is not set
Doesn't work:
CONFIG_FB=y
CONFIG_FB_VESA=y
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_PCI_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_FONT_8x8=y
CONFIG_FONT_8x16=y
CONFIG_LOGO=y
CONFIG_LOGO_LINUX_MONO=y
CONFIG_LOGO_LINUX_VGA16=y
CONFIG_LOGO_LINUX_CLUT224=y
I've not had a chance to play binary search on those options yet..  Graphics
card is an NVidia GeForce 440Go, and was previous working just fine with
framebuffer over on vc1-6 and NVidia's driver on an XFree86 on vc7. (OK, I
admit I didn't stress test the framebuffer side much past "penguins and
scroiled text"...)
