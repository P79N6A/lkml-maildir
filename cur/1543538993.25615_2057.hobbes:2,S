I know, and I address that in the document.  Boot protocol 2.02 plus
bzImage allows the boot loader the flexibility to set the memory ceiling
quite low.  However, we needed a "drop dead" address for existing
kernels as well, and John, Hans and I came up with 0x9A000 as being
something we can reasonably do.  It is not always sufficient -- when
using M-systems flash or PXE the EBDA is several hundred K in size. 
There is no way to support this with the old kernels which require
mucking with the 0x90000 segment.  Hence the revised protocol.
However, I'll see if I can add a note.
The problem is that most of these are hard limits for the boot loader --
doing INT 12h to find out the ceiling only allows you to print an error
message instead of crashing.
