  IMO this handling of truncate will increase disk fragmentation as balloc() would
think the block is allocated even if it can be freed so to prevent this we would have to
go through the queues - nasty as we would have to handle indirect blocks somehow...
  Also when we are going to free some block we have to capture ext2 superblock lock and
I'm looking forward to those beatiful deadlocks ;-). (OK I agree this can be avoided...).
  And anyway everything we achieve is just delaying of the work so when we start flushing
free blocks the fs will be as unusable (superblock lock held) as during rm... So IMHO it's
no worth problems which might arise... I think more finegrained locking (not just one big
sb lock) would be bigger win but it's issue for ext3.
