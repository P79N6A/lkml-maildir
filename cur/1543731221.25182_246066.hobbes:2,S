I need to do the syscalls from kernel space. Basically
I am porting our custom vxWorks driver to Linux. We
want to basically keep the structure of the vxWorks
driver the same, so I am porting the individual
vxWorks functions such as semBcreate, semGive etc.
Thats why I want to use the SysV IPC semaphores, as
they seem to most closely resemble the vxWorks ones. I
know that there are much better ways of writing a
driver, but that wouldn't fit in with the currect
structure we have at the moment.
Now if I want to call lets say sys_semget() from
kernel space, must I use the _syscall3() function? I
saw some people using this. 
Thanks for the help.
Arne
