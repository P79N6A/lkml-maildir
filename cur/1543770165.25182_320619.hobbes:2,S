Well, I am already bald  :)
What you are missing is that the PIT can not generate a 1ms tick.  The best it 
can do is 999849 nanoseconds.  Given this we need to convert 20000 usec to not 
less than 2000usec worth of jiffies (time MUST always be rounded up).  20 
jiffies is 19.996980 usec so we need to use 21 (which is 20.996829 usec).
Note that TICK_NSEC and tick_nsec will both be 999849 nanoseconds.
If we do NOT account for this PIT issue, the result is a time drift that is 
outside of what ntp can handle...
