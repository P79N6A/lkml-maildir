That sounds good. I'd include that.

How does this sound?...
What is 'swsusp2'?
swsusp2 is Software Suspend 2, forked implementation of suspend-to-disk
which is available as separate patches for 2.4 and 2.6 kernels from
swsusp.sourceforge.net. It includes support for SMP, 4GB Highmem and
preemption. It also has a extensible architecture that allows for
arbitrary transformations on the image (compression, encryption) and
arbitrary backends for writing the image (eg to swap or an NFS
share[Work In Progress]). Questions regarding suspend2 should be sent to
the mailing list available through the Suspend2 website, and not to the
Linux Kernel Mailing List. We are working toward merging Suspend2 into
the mainline kernel.
