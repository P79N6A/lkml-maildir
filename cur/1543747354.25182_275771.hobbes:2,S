Then your definition of a "contract" is flawed or your world-view has 
nothing to do with reality.
An ABI is not a contract. It's somebody exposing a certain set of 
features. It does _not_ mean that the party that gets exposed has any say 
wrt the features. At most he can hope that the exported set doesn't 
shrink or change semantically, but let's face it, even that does happen.
The Linux kernel has been very very good about this exposure, in the sense 
that we try very very hard not to break it. I think that's a good thing. 
But that in no way makes anything a "contract".
It's the same thing with CPU vendors. You as a programmer, didn't get to 
dictate what the CPU vendor implemented. You take it or leave it, and at 
most you can make suggestions about things that might make the CPU vendor 
sell more chips. The ISA is not a "contract" - it's just an interface that 
was handed down to you. You didn't get to negotiate, you got to say "yes" 
or "no".
