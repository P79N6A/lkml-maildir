Some distros will mount tmpfs over /dev so that a minimal "real dev" can be 
provided as a fallback, but udev can add and remove nodes from /dev ad hoc 
during regular runtime. So I don't think there's a bug and I don't think 
anything is lying.
If you want the dev your distro gave you, just mount your rootfs on another 
mount point in read-only and run tar over that instead.
