No you can tell a drive to do anything that the identify reports as
capable.  Thus your driver has to know if the adapter senses the cable and
if the drive acknowledges presense.
You can take a U100 drive and put it on an ATA-2 adapter and tell it to
talk at U100 add it will in one direction.  Drives are defaulted to as
fast as they can go.

You can drink from both, but you had damn well only cracked the value on
the fire hose, else you will look like BB King blowing a horn.
