Ok, so how about something like this? Which other chips should be marked?

Introduce the MTD_STUPID_LOCK flag which indicates that the flash chip
is always locked after power-up, so all sectors need to be unlocked
before it is usable.
If this flag is set, and the chip provides an unlock() operation,
mtd_add_device will unlock the whole MTD device if it's writeable. This
means that non-writeable partitions will stay locked.
Set MTD_STUPID_LOCK in fixup_use_atmel_lock() so that these chips will
work as expected.
