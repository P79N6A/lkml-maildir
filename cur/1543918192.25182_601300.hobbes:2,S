I believe most sane tools would be using the output of uname -m, so a
possible way to fix this would be fixing the data passed to userspace
from uname. However, that might be the case that it creates a new set
of problems too, with tools relying on the output of uname -m to
determine wheter the machine is 32 or 64 bit, and so on.
