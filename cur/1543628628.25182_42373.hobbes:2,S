  It all depends...  At least the cisco switches I have used have
  protection by controlling on how large frames you can send, and
  having automatic enlarging of frame size for VLAN Trunking port.
  Of course those switches have some amounts of "jumbogram support"
  as well at port by port basis.
  So perhaps you can DoS your machine off the net (or your stream
  very least), but not other machines.
