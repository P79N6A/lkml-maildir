Jon, you're not making sense any more.
This discussion is just ridiculous, and I don't think it's worth cc'ing me 
if people can't try to work together, since I'm sadly not going to have 
time to actually implement any of this myself.
If you are claiming that we should suspend/resume the whole chip just 
because two different programs want to access it, you're just crazy. 
We clearly _do_ have different subsystems already working together 
accessign the same chip, and they are _not_ doing stupid things like you 
are suggesting. They _work_. Today. No suspend/resume involved.
That interaction has some troubles, and we're trying to _fix_ them. We're 
not trying to make idiotic statments.
Yours was a singularly idiotic statment.
