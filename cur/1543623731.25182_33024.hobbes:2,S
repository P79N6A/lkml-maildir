Hello,
          I am trying to do a select()  on a net interface.   I need
the poll functionality of a char driver.   That is - I want the select
to block until a certain condition in the driver/hardware becomes
true.   This condition is notified to me by the interrupt handler.
Can somebody point out to how the select() works for sockets.  It goes
to the tcp_select() or udp_select()  in the network subsystem.   However
I want it to go to the net interface.
Pointers to related info would be helpful.
Thanks
Himanshu
