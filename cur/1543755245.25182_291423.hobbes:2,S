ok the paxtest 0.9.5 I downloaded from a security site (not yours) had
this gem in:

        } else {

which is clearly there to sabotage any segmentation based approach (eg
execshield and openwall etc); it cannot have any other possible use or
meaning.
the paxtest 0.9.6 that John Moser mailed to this list had this gem in
it:

which is clearly there with the only possible function of sabotaging the
automatic PT_GNU_STACK setting by the toolchain (which btw is not fedora
specific but happens by all new enough (3.3 or later) gcc compilers on
all distros) since that requires an executable stack.
Now I know you're a honest and well meaning guy and didn't put those
sabotages in, and I did indeed not get paxtests from your site directly,
so they obviously must have been tampered with, hence me calling it de-
sabotaging when I fixed this issue (by moving the function to not be
nested).
