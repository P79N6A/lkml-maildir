It's not a bug - it is a feature.  uptime rolls over after 497 days.
[sic]
It computes the result of the "uptime" based on the internal "jiffies"
counter, which counts the time since boot, in units of 10
milliseconds.
This is typecast as an "unsigned long" - on the Intel boxes, that's an
unsigned 32-bit number.
Well, it turns out that in a 32-bit number, you can store 497.1 days
before the number wraps.
You can use:
last -xf /var/run/utmp runlevel
to get true uptime in this instance.
