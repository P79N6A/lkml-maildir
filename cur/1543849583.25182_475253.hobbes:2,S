CONFIG_SUNRPC is set to the value to which you set CONFIG_NFS_FS - look at 
option NFS_FS in fs/Kconfig:
config NFS_FS
        tristate "NFS file system support"
        depends on INET
        select LOCKD
        select SUNRPC
        select NFS_ACL_SUPPORT if NFS_V3_ACL
So if you want sunrpc to be built as module, set CONFIG_NFS_FS "NFS 
filesystem support" to M. It just works(tm).
