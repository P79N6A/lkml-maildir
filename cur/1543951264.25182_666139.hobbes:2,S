hm, three things:
firstly, the clts is now done _after_ fpu_init() - are you sure that's 
OK? We do it in this order so that FINIT [on older cpus] does not fault.
secondly, while i know you were responding to review feedback from 
others, but the do_group_exit(SIGKILL) looks quite bad. It's totally 
undebuggable to the user - not even a coredump will be generated AFAICS 
- and the user has no idea that this all happened due to out-of-memory. 
A (forced) SIGBUS is our usual answer to out-of-memory situations. [such 
as when a pagetable allocation fails] If you get review feedback that 
suggests a crappy solution then please resist it! :-)
thirdly, the irq enable/disable worries me. Can it ever trigger in 
kernel code that has irqs off? If it happens when kernel uses the FPU in 
irqs-off sections (to do SSE optimized routines, etc.) then enabling 
irqs is dangerous - the original callsite had it disabled for a reason. 
At minimum we should add a debug check to math_state_restore(), 
something like:
  WARN_ON_ONCE(!(regs->flags & X86_EFLAGS_IF))
(this means we need to pass regs to math_state_restore())
