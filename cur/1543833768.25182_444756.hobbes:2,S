The most frightening too. Reiserfs might be suitable for very specific appliactions, but to use it in production machine, you need to have some guts.
My last reiserfs partition was blown up two days ago, because of a bad sector, plus a fatal oops, looping endlessly. This was the second time, and the last one, as none of my ext3 filesystems *ever* had similar problems, despite numerous other bad sector issues. Not mentionning the funny "recovery" tool, which generally finishes to trash your data.

The funny part is that 14 july is the french's fireworks day, generally launched around midnight.
