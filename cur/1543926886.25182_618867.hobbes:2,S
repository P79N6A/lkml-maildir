I stared at this a bit, and it took me some time to try to grok what it 
is trying to do.  Eventually I figured it out, and I wonder if there 
isn't an easier -- or at least more efficient -- way to accomplish this 
goal.
It seems to me that we could accomplish the same thing by passing the 
number of parameters in the upper bits of the system call number 
register (%eax in the case of x86.)  If set to zero, we'd fill in the 
legacy number of registers (for backwards compatibility.)  Unspecified 
arguments are then forced to zero before invoking the target function; 
we could also make a register count available if need be.
Alternatively, the same thing can be done with a dense system call 
number space by adding a number of parameters field to the system call 
table, however, that is more invasive in that one has to poke something 
into each architecture (unfortunately -- it would be so much nicer if 
there was a central metafile which one could process into the various 
architecture system call tables.)
