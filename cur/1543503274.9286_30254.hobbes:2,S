Probably, although it's not used. How come earlier kernels probed the
card fine though, with no difference in the hardware settings?
I can also add that if I specify "ether=9,0x360,eth0" to LILO then the
card is detected fine, and works fine.
For reference, the cards I use were all obtained second hand, and
whilst the IRQ is jumperable, the address is not. I would presume the
address was originally set using some DOS-based program, but that
didn't come with the cards, so I'm basically stuck with whatever they
were last set to...

I'll resend them to you - they were originally just to L-K so were
probably easy to overlook...

Perhaps if that gets corrected, the various threads about the kernel
sleeping for incorrect periods will go away - I imagine the kernel
sleep is connected with the kernel timer...
Best wishes from Riley.
