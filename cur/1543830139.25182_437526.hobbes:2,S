Andrew,
This applies on top of the rollup of -mm (as of 5:39, 26 Jun 06), over 2.6.17,
that you have provided at
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/x.bz2
Using this and not 2.6.17-mm2 due to inclusion of other patches that aren't in -mm2.
This concludes the changes I planned to make and should hopefully address all
the overhead concerns.
Jay,
If there are any remaining overhead issues you see, pls let me know asap.
Thanks,
Shailabh
