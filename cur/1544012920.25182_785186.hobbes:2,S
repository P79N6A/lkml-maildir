It would be very useful to implement error handling in a way
that has an arch independed framework.  ia64 has already
implemented much of this functionality.

Something along those lines, though I would support more of
Andi's code getting in for .29 (even if it means putting code
into .29 and then changing it for .30).  It will take time to
come up with a cross arch framework, longer than the .29
merge window.
