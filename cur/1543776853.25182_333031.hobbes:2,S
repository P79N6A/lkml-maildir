Indeed we can be adding to the committing transaction's t_forget list
here.  The fix looks correct: we're taking the j_list_lock anyway in
that loop for the checkpoint processing, so we're not taking it any more
frequently by grabbing it for the loop condition itself too --- just
holding it a little longer.
