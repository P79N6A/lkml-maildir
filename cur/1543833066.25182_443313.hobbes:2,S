If flags comes first, I would rather like to call it execfve(), or 
perhaps execxve() ("extended") or execove() ("options").  execfve() 
sounds like it executes a file descriptor (which would probably be 
called fexecve()).
Perhaps more seriously, if we're adding more functionality already, it 
should acquire -at functionality (execveat) and take a directory argument.
