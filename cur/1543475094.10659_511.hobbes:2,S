Will,
Funnily enough, I get this too with 2.2.0-pre2 (never had enough time to
compile pre3 before pre4 ccame out!) - pppd alleges that it's received a
SIGHUP, and drops the line. Also, PPP sessions seem to lose large chunks of
their bandwidth - *everything* slows down (I'm lucky to get more than about
1.6k/sec).
Everything was fine with 2.0.36...
I have NT (spit) on the same machine, and this works almost perfectly with
my ISP.
