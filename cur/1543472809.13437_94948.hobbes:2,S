But the USPTO says:
  "The term of the patent shall be 20 years from the date on which the
   application for the patent was filed in the United States"
  (from 
http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/doc/general/whatispa.htm
 )
20 years?
I constantly hear people saying it is 17 years from the time the
patent is issued...
The RSA patent was filed on Dec. 14, 1977 - but issued on Sept. 20, 1983:
http://patents.uspto.gov/cgi-bin/ifetch4?INDEX
+PATBIB-ALL+0+4679+0+1+177277+OF+1+1+1+4%2c405%2c829
This page says it expires on September 20, 2000:
  
http://www.cyberlaw.com/rsa.html
(Which agrees with 17 years from issued date)
Can anybody explain the discrepency?
Maybe the 17 year timeframe is an old rule which they've changed?
Cheers,
