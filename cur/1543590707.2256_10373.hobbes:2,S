hda: IBM-DTLA-307030, ATA DISK drive
hdc: ST34312A, ATA DISK drive
hda: 60036480 sectors (30739 MB) w/1916KiB Cache, CHS=3737/255/63, UDMA(66)

/arc is logical volume on hda, /mobile is partition on hdc (mobile -
becouse it's on disk in mobile rack ;)), so test is good.
Soon I will test this on SCSI disk.
