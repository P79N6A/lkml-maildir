The way to find the Makefiles changed during the 2.5 development
cycle. Now the kbuild Makefile (the one for comedi for example) are
included from scripts/Makfile.build hereby obsoleting Rules.make.
You will NOT succeed creating a single simple makefile supporting both
2.4 and 2.6. On the other hand the Makefile are so trivial that creating
two distinct version should be acceptable?

The most simple Makefile looks like this:
obj-m := comedi.o
No more is actually needed.
You should get rid of export-objs as well - they are also obsoleted
in 2.5/2.6.

The right fix is to allow you to build a kernel in a directory
separate from the kernel src. This is WIP - hopefully included in 
mainline within a few weeks.
