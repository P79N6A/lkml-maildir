Whoa, hang on.
The way we expect get_user_pages() to be used is that the kernel will use
get_user_pages() once per application I/O request.
Are you saying that RDMA clients will semi-permanently own pages which were
pinned by get_user_pages()?  That those pages will be used for multiple
separate I/O operations?
If so, then that's a significant design departure and it would be good to
hear why it is necessary.

Sure.  But such an app could be declared to be buggy...
