Hi
I'm busy writing a security module that does some very basic ACL stuff
on a per-task basis. If my module obtains and holds a dentry for
/proc/<pid> (via path_lookup), then the task_free_security hook is
never called for that process. Since the module releases the dentry in
task_free_security, this creates a chicken-and-egg problem and neither
the task nor the dentry is ever released. A side-effect is that the
module refcount never drops to 0.
Perhaps the LSM framework needs a hook for a task exiting (transition
to zombie state), in addition to the task_free_security hook? That
would allow resources to be freed from zombies, including these types
of circular references.
Thanks
Bruce
