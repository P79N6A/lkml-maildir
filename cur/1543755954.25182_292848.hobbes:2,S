By the way Larry, wasn't the BKrev supposed to help with finding
the changesets on bkbits ?
Because I'm not sure if it works anymore (or how it is supposed to
work).
For example:
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.6/cset@41fe5327BXOmplstrv49I26qAg7mIA
gives only the merge changeset, obviously not the same as the above
revision.
Stelian.
