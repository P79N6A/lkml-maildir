Hallo,
I bought the 2 chanel thing for 400 DM (~160$). I guess the 8 chanel
thing is about 1000DM. That's not too much I think. Even  single two
chanel PCI adapter is around 100 DM. And as your ideal card propably
isn't produced in big numbers, it will be more expensive per chanel
than the commodity products...
Bye
