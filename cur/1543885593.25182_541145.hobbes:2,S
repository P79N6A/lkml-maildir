You're absolutely right, but to give Jeff the benefit of the doubt I'm
sure he _meant_ "users" there although he said "developers". Stating
the obvious, the developer _has_ to know what stuff his code uses
anyway, otherwise what does he "select"s or "depends" his config
option on.
As for users, we _can_ avoid pitfalls by building a complete
dependency tree and just selecting _everything_ that we require for a
particular config option to be selected, but some users could
conceivably prefer only being _told_ about what else they need to
successfully pick a config option (than everything just getting in
behind their backs). Actually (correct me if I'm wrong), this is not
presently possible: an option is not visible unless dependencies are
already picked. Just a suggestion, though.
