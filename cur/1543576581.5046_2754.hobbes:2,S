Hi,
Compiling 2.4.0-test12 for the Miata Alpha platform seems to result in a kernel
which does not correctly handle (or initialize ?) ISA IRQ's. The result is that
ps/2 keyboard and mouse and floppy don't work. I didn't check if the serial or
parallel ports work. Compiling 2.4.0-test12 for the generic Alpha platform does
work. Any ideas or insights ?
Thanks,
Peter.
