NFS always struck me as a peverse design.  "The fileserver must be stateless 
with regard to clients, even though maintainging state is what a filesystem 
DOES, and the point of the thing is to export a filesystem."  Okay...  (If it 
was exporting read-only filesystems with no locking of any kind, maybe they'd 
have a point, but come on guys...)
So here's an example of where the fileserver _does_ expect to maintain 
non-file state across reboots.  "Ooh, the device node we're exporting is part 
of the ID, gee, we missed one!"
So why, exactly, can the NFS server not maintain whatever extra state it needs 
to remember between reboots in a filesystem?  (Not even necessarily the one 
it's exporting, just some rc file something under /var.)  The device node it 
was exporting USED to be in the filesystem, you know, ala mknod.  Now that 
the kernel's not keeping that stable, have the #*%(&# server generate a 
number and make a note of it somewhere.  (Is requiring an NFS server to have 
access to persistent storage too much to ask?)
Personally, I could never figure out why Samba servers are in userspace but 
NFS servers seem to want to live in the kernel.  I can almost secure a samba 
server for access to the outside world, but a NFS system that isn't behind a 
firewall automatically says to me "this machine has already been compromised 
eight ways from sunday within five minutes of being exposed to the internet".  
Call me paranoid...
