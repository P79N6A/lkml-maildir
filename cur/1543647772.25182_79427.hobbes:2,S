It would appear that there is a problem in the ide-scsi kernel module.  I 
HAVE properly built the kernel beforehand, so I know it's not a matter of 
the kernel being improperly built.  Here's the error message I'm getting 
when I try to insmod ide-scsi:
Using /lib/modules/2.4.19/kernel/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.o
/lib/modules/2.4.19/kernel/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.o: unresolved symbol 
scsi_unregister_module_R81d85a75
/lib/modules/2.4.19/kernel/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.o: unresolved symbol 
scsi_register_Rfb1392b2
/lib/modules/2.4.19/kernel/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.o: unresolved symbol 
scsi_register_module_Rfa20b7b0
This is the only module that is doing this, so it's an isolated incident.  
The problem is that I need to use ide-scsi to use my CD writer.  Is there 
a patch for this, or am I doing something wrong that I didn't know about?  
The version of gcc I'm using is "gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 
7.3 2.96-110)".  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
