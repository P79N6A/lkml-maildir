i can no know because i changed hardware with that kernel already
installed :(.
Btw the messages are gone with 2.6.18 final and i suspect that
everything comes down to a buggy bios
[You can ignore the rest of msg it is just a rant]
 Sometimes it messes up system date and time forcing fsck in hd's and
other headaches. i see a msg at boot time about bios not reserving
e820 memory and PCI: mmio disabled or something like that. i can not
tell for sure because oddly enough the msg does not end up in logs ??)

thanks for your work in Linux

The latitude and longtitude of the bios writers current position, and
