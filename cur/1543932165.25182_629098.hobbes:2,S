Nope. As shown above there is no other hole that we can conbine with the
4 bytes padding on struct timer_list.
<brainfarting>
What we could do, perhaps, would be to struct start_comm to be a pointer
and store the strings in a list, refcounted, so instead of 16 or 12
bytes we would use 8, but would incur in some CPU overhead definetely
bigger than a simple memcpy, but that would reduce even further the
memory footprint.
But the hole would still be there, as it would be sizeof(void *) +
sizeof(start_pid) :-)
