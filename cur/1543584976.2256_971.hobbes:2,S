Most professional UPS with Network Management Cards can go a sever to sleep
mode if the power gets down and they will
awake the Server with a "Wake-on-Lan" signal if power is back.
Afaik Wake-On-Lan is a Mainboard/Bios Feature and will work with any OS which
can put the System into the right Sleep mode.
