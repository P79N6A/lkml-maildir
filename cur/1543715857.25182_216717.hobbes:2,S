stdarg.h is innocent, it is just one of the few include files valid in
the stdinc paths.
How about making sure the dependency information is complete, even when
BK has just "bk clean"ed an unedited file in the course of a "bk pull"?
Maybe mkdep or Makefile should just try to check out missing files and
mkdep barf if it cannot open a file it was given? It works for .c files,
it works for many of the .h files - it lacks for some other .h files and
for the Config.in or Kconfig files. That would leave the BK user with
just the "bk get" boot-strap at top level.
