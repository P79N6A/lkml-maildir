Anything new on this? It sounds rather strange considering your
unmounted disks got trashed too, so either it's a problem with the
SCSI subsystem (or the driver; it might be a bug that got triggered
by something else) or some sort of hardware failure.
What kind of pattern was repeated on the disk, by the way? Maybe this
could shed some light unto what happened.
