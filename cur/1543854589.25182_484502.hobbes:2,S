I am speaking of a scenario when we start supporting kernel accounting
and of-course the swapless case.

Ok.. but can you have a consistent guarantee definition with un-reclaimable
kernel resources? How do you define a guarantee in a consistent manner?
In my discussions earlier on lkml, I had suggested that we define guarantee
only for reclaimable resources and provide support only for them.

Yep, I was listening to a talk from a customer service expert and he
mentioned that it's used to boost performance.

Like I said I am not against guarantees, but do we have to implement
them in our first iteration?
