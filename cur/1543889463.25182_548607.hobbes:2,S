hd.c can drive MFM and RLL disks and drivers/ide cannot. Although it
really wants burying further down the config tree the ability to read MFM
and RLL disks when recovering ancient data is useful and people do
actually use this driver now and then rescuing stuff like twenty year old
datasets.
It thus needs fixing not removing.
