the attached patch was a quick hack to get rid of the global cli() from
drivers/ide/main.c - but it's obviously broken and i'd like to fix it.
how can this be done cleanly - should we do a:
	synchronize_irq(drive->channel->irq);
before unregistering the driver?
this might not even be necessery i believe, since the implicit (?)  
free_irq() synchronizes with all pending instances of that interrupt
source.
is there something else i'm missing, something else we need to synchronize
with - perhaps the timers?
