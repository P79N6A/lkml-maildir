Indeed, a diff between the relevant pas2_*.c modules in 2.2.13 and
2.3.38 produces no output; i.e. they are the same.  I have the subject
soundcard and haven't had a problem with it since 1.2.13.  
I never recommend compiling support for this card as modular; there
seems to be no end of trouble initializing it.  
Points to consider when troubleshooting:
1.  Ensure you aren't trying to use the same IRQ as a network card.
From the factory it is configured to use 11, which a lot of network
cards try to also grab.
2.  Try defining SYMPHONY_PAS when compiling the code.  Per the comments
in the source code, this could fix problems if a particular board has
the symphony chip.
3.  Has the code been compiled correctly but no sound?  aumix, or some
other userspace program may need to be used to set the volume.  
Following is the relevant configuration used to compile my kernel.  I
hope some of this helps people.
