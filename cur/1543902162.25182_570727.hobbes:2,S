Phew, yes, that's what I meant - thanks.
[PATCH] Remove nid_lock from alloc_fresh_huge_page
The fix to the race in alloc_fresh_huge_page() which could give an illegal
node ID did not need nid_lock at all: the fix was to replace static int nid
by static int prev_nid and do the work on local int nid.  nid_lock did make
sure that racers strictly roundrobin the nodes, but that's not something we
actually need to enforce strictly.  Kill that nid_lock.
