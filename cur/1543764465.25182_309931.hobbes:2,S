Note we are speaking of 2 lines of code. And there's no point in omitting 
this.

Yes, I know this. But the old versions (the one shipped on Mdk) didn't work 
for online resizing (this was verified by me with lots of warnings and a Oops 
on reiserfs code); in fact, this ability is so new that is not even 
documented in manpages.
