I changed my code to look like this:
		char *p = info->pg_result;
                 __u64 mbps = 0;
                 __u64 t1 = (info->pg_sofar*1000);
                 __u64 t2 = do_div(total, 1000);
                 __u64 pps = 0; /* do_div(t1, t2); */
                 t1 = (info->pg_sofar * 1000);
                 mbps = 0;/* do_div(t1, t2); */
                 /* mbps *= info->pkt_size; */
This code will load w/out problems.  However, if I uncomment the do_div
on the line: __u64 pps = 0; /* do_div(t1, t2); */
then I get another unresolved symbol:
__umodi3
I'm guessing that there is some optimization the compiler is doing that
is using the mod operator somehow, but I am unsure about how to work around
this.
Thanks,
Ben
