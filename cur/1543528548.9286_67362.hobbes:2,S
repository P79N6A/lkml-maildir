I think I spotted the bug:
	fifo_open() doesn't initialize PIPE_WAITING_{READERS,WRITERS}.

could you initialize PIPE_WAITING_{READERS,WRITERS} to 1 and boot that
kernel?
* fs/fifo.c, line 40
+ PIPE_WAITING_READERS(*inode) = PIPE_WAITING_WRITERS(*inode) = 1;
* fs/pipe.c, line 556
- PIPE_WAITING_READERS(*inode) = PIPE_WAITING_WRITERS(*inode) = 0;
+ PIPE_WAITING_READERS(*inode) = PIPE_WAITING_WRITERS(*inode) = 1;
AFAIKS, the kernel should boot, and if your shell scripts lock up, then
we are on the right track.
Additionally, one goto look weird: "goto do_more_write" is never
executed, because when the code reaches that if-clause, either
O_NONBLOCK is set, or count is zero.
I also noticed that my patch has a similar problem, I'll post an updated
patch soon.
