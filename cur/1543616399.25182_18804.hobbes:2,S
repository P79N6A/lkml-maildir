Then add an init script and include installation of it to the
installation steps of your autoconfigurator (it has to be installed
anyway). If a distributor packages your program, he will include the
init script into his package and enable it according to his init
policy, or write an own init script, if your provided one doesn't
fit.
That's the way it works for network daemons etc. for years.
