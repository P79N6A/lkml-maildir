And with good reason, it seems (the warranty reduction) - my Maxtor
6L060J3 (or whatever, the 7200rpm 60G ATA-100) died after approx. 8
weeks (bad sectors); warranty replacement; replacement dies after
approx. 16 weeks (bad sectors); I'm now on the 2nd replacement. Oh
joy.
I have to say that I have a few more (~ 5) Maxtor drives running which
didn't cause any trouble... so far.
Yes, I did switch to Maxtor because of excessive outages of IBM drives
(DeathStar), why do you ask?
So long,
   Joe
