No, but nearly.  We don't want to override the skip of a task with the 
highest priority until we've skipped one such task OR we're sure one 
such task will be skipped (e.g. because it's the currently running task).

If there are more than one task with the highest priority then it is 
desirable to move one of them by overriding the skip mechanism as it can 
be considered the second highest priority task.  This initialization 
just checks to see if the currently running task is one of the highest 
priority tasks.  If it is then it's OK to move the first task we find 
that also has the same priority otherwise we wait until we've skipped 
one before we move one.

Yes, but this is recording the fact that we've skipped one and that it's 
now OK to move one.

I think that it does.

If you think that there's still a problem after the above explanation 
then sending a patch might help me understand why you think it's wrong.
