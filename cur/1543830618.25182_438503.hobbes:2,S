Correction... divdi3, moddi3, udivdi3, umoddi3 and udivmoddi4 are also 
provided, but are implemented as generic subroutines in C instead of 
assembly:
KLIBCARCHOBJS = \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/socketcall.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/setjmp.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/syscall.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/varsyscall.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/open.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/openat.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/sigreturn.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/vfork.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/libgcc/__ashldi3.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/libgcc/__ashrdi3.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/libgcc/__lshrdi3.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/libgcc/__muldi3.o \
         arch/$(KLIBCARCH)/libgcc/__negdi2.o \
         libgcc/__divdi3.o \
         libgcc/__moddi3.o \
         libgcc/__udivdi3.o \
         libgcc/__umoddi3.o \
         libgcc/__udivmoddi4.o
It probably would be more efficient if i386's native division 
instructions could be exploited, but it hasn't been a pressing issue.
