If I had to run mtadm and aa alongside each other, I would put aa
into the "secondary" LSM slot.
A number of people have said by now that LSM is supposed to be a
restrict-my-rights block of code. As such, I would put the special,
tiny, give-me-rights code at the front so that it be executed first.
This is what would be intended with mtadm. It really just gives you a
few caps when switching to UID 900 (or whatever), just as Linux
traditionally gives you full caps when switching to UID 0 (e.g. by
executing setuid files). From there on, it is just restrictions, and
the order in which LSMs restrict your actions is probably not so
important as long as they do restrict it.
Thankfully, Linux capabilities are so strangely designed that they
actually become useful - they give you so much power that you _can_
only restrict things afterwards again :-)
