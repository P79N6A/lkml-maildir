Yep, but we can do something like :
static void fill_tslice_map(void)
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < NICE_RANGE; i++) {
        ts_table[i] = ((MIN_NICE_TSLICE +
                        ((MAX_NICE_TSLICE - MIN_NICE_TSLICE) /
                         (NICE_RANGE - 1)) * i) * HZ) / 1000000;
        if (!ts_table[i]) ts_table[i] = 1;
    }
}
