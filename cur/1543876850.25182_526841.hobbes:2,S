I did try again, and I found this patch:
http://dl.bytesex.org/patches/uml-2.6.11/uml-x11-fb
Which applied (2 rejects by hand), but failed with
"Mapping memory: Cannot allocate memory"
in mmap64:
os_map_memory [...]
   at arch/um/os-Linux/process.c:164
and this one:
http://www.suse.de/~kraxel/uml/patches/2.6.18-rc4/uml-x11-fb
which applied cleanly, but is not letting me set the option - Kconfig is 
beyond me:
arch/um/Kconfig:144:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'X11_FB' 
refer to undefined symbol 'FB_CFB_FILLRECT'
arch/um/Kconfig:145:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'X11_FB' 
refer to undefined symbol 'FB_CFB_COPYAREA'
arch/um/Kconfig:146:warning: 'select' used by config symbol 'X11_FB' 
refer to undefined symbol 'FB_CFB_IMAGEBLIT'
So that's a non-starter for me...
