AFAIU you are running oom without the oom killer kicking in. 
That's reasonable with tmpfs: the tmpfs pages are accounted to the
page cache, but are not freeable if there is no free swap space. So
the vm tries to free memory without success. (The same should be true
for ramfs but exaggerated by the fact that ramfs can never free the
page)
In the -ac series I introduced separate accounting for shmem pages and
do reduce the page cache size by this count for meminfo and
vm_enough_memory. Perhaps the oom coding needs also some knowledge
about this?
Greetings
