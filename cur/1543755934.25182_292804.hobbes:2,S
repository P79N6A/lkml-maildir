Thanks for trying, okay, your problem is a different one from
what my patch fixes: I thought that might turn out to be so.

And kernel rebuilt, I trust!

No, that's right, it was only fixing mm/mmap.c.
Please point me privately to your app source, oh, it may be gigantic,
or difficult for me to compile, I guess your binary as well or instead:
so I can try to reproduce on i386.
We notice fpga_read and fpga_ioctl in both your traces, not in our
2.6.10 kernel source: just leftover addresses on the stack, not part
of the real backtrace, but interestingly there in both.  Where are
they from (FC3?), any idea what chance it's doing something bad?
