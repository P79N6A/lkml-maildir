It shouldn't if netfilter is behaving correctly.  The whole point of
TSO is that the packet is an otherwise valid TCP/IP packet.  The only
thing special about it is that it exceeds the MTU of the output device.
That's what allows us to implement TSO without touching all parts of
the networking stack.
