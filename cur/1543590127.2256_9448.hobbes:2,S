Why?  Just use it as a backup version.  No need to rename
anything at all.  I never rename a kernel, Sysmap, module dir or
anything when trying out a new kernel.   I use EXTRAVERSION
instead - for its intended purpose - which was to eliminate these
sort of problems.

How could it possibly add any uncertainity about anything?  My
kernel is 2.4.2-2 right now.  If I build a new one, it will be
2.4.4-1asdf probably (asdf is my machine).  If I then want to try
a new kernel but am not sure if I want the old one still, the new
kernel will be 2.4.4-2asdf.  None of the kernels have files that
conflict, and the names of them never change.  I add a new stanza
to lilo for the new kernel, run lilo, and can easily boot any of
the kernels.

Better yet, rewrite those broken scripts to work with todays
kernel features.  My install-kernel script works just fine for
adding a new kernel to the system.
By using new tools you avoid old problems.

Signature poll:  I'm planning on getting a 12 or 16 port autosensing
10/100 ethernet switch soon for home use, and am interested in hearing
others recommendations on what to buy.  Cost isn't as important as is
functionality and quality.  Any suggestions appreciated.
