Why not? You'd get a perl binary that has the capability you asked for,
nothing more.

Can't be done anywhere else: It has to be done by a trusted authority, and

In a sense, those are kernel extensions. You'd have to trust them too, for
otherwise they could just mangle the executable in interesting ways
(loading "wrong" libraries, ...).
