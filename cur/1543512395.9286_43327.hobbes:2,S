    No, not really.  I was working on something like that myself before
    richard gooch published his devfs -- I was building a /proc/dev for
    2.0.x, with the idea that the machine would come up, and a daemon
    would massage dev with the appropriate major and minor numbers.
    When richard announced his devfs, I complained bitterly about one or
    another thing in it, up until I realized that, no, I was wrong and
    that they way he did it was far more useful, because I could use it
    the way I originally intended, plus I could automatically mount it
    and build much more efficient installers and appliance systems.

    But it's not as versatile as a real devfs is, and I don't see that
    stripping functionality out of a devfs (without any benefit over
    the real thing;  you still have to write the filesystem glue, plus
    you still need to tweak all the appropriate-level drivers to populate
    the filesystem) _just to prevent people from mounting it on /dev_
    is anything other than a political instead of a technical decision.
    Yeah, Al Viro has complained that it does unspecified horrible things
    to the VFS.   But I'm not convinced.

    Unfortunately, /proc does not allow userland to create entries,
    otherwise you'd be able to mount a devfs on /proc/devices right
    now (at least in 2.0.28, I can mount devices on /proc/net, /proc/scsi,
    and so on.  It looks really gross, but it works, if you can ignore
    the piteous whining from the net tools as they become horribly
    confused at the FreeBSD ISO image that's in /dev/net)  If devfs was in
    the kernel, this would be a good time to write a generalized virtual
    fs, and then the kernel could instantiate[1] two copies of it, one
    for /proc (mounted as immutable, or mutable, take your choice) and
    one for /proc/devices, /devices, or /dev for those people who want
    to use it for that.
                  ____
    david parsons \bi/ /proc/partitions is a pretty good reason to put
                   \/                        devfs into the kernel now.
