Yes, 2.5.38 behaves differently again, but the statement that
pgrp-related behaviour of some programs changed is still true.
For example: "emacs -nw foo.c" in an xterm window
will start emacs fine. Now put this line in a shell script:
	#!/bin/sh
	emacs -nw $@
so that pid and pgrp of the started emacs differ. Under 2.5.33
this works, but under 2.5.3[78] this hangs.
