Hmmm...  Netfilter compiles cleanly here.  My guess is that your gcc
is more fastidious about const declarations.  Could you please either
let me know what arch/gcc-settings you are using, or, alternatively,
see if the following patch fixes things up?  The comparison against
NULL should at least emit warnings for non-pointer types -- not as
good as an error, but better than emitting bogus warnings.
So I guess I should stick with simple things like preemptable RCU instead
of the much more difficult task of outsmarting gcc...
