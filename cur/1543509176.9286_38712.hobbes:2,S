	Hello Jussi,  Might just try a RH6.0 boot CD & see .
	iirc they arre supported with the caveat that the vme
	bus is not supported (yet ?) .  Another way to try it
	would be to net boot(tftp) the 4/490 from another system
	a linux-x86 for example .  www.redhat.com has much info
	on this process .  Hth,  JimL
