Hi all,
Has anyone successfully inplemented an IBM SerialRAID card under the linux
kernel?  I know we have no code for it as of 2.6.10, but I figured that
someone may have a patched together module floating around somewhere.
These are typically used in pSeries and eSeries machines as (surprise) as
raid controller for SSA disk arrays.
Thanks in advance,
Scott
