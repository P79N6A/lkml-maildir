See the attached 'devices' file.
Summary:
    T:  Bus=02 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#=  7 Spd=12  MxCh= 0
    S:  Manufacturer=iriver Limited.
    S:  Product=iriver Internet Audio Player N10
    T:  Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=01 Cnt=01 Dev#=  9 Spd=480 MxCh= 0
    S:  Manufacturer=SanDisk Corp.
    S:  Product=Cruzer Micro
So my mp3 player wasn't USB 2.0. (I told you I wasn't sure.)
I still don't think it should transfer at 20-30 kB/s though, and
certainly not that the keyring (Spd=480) should either. The mp3 player
used to be *much* faster.
