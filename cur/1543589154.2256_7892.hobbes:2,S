Why copy it into RAM? Why not use cramfs and either turn the writable
directories into symlinks into a ramfs which you create at boot time, or 
union-mount a ramfs over the top of it?

True. We are currently lacking a compact, compressing, journalling 
filesystem for use on block devices. It's been suggested that we could make 
JFFS2 work on them, by making a fake MTD device which uses a block device 
as backing store. Nobody's yet shown me the code though :)
