Subject: Suse 2.4.16 LVM hangs with multiple snapshots of the same LV

I have a single-processor ppro200 with 96M memory running Suse's 2.4.16 
kernel (k_deflt-2.4.16-22).  I am creating and mounting many (like 8-10) 
snapshots of the same logical volume over a week or so (a poor man's 
nightly backup, if you will).  The write activity on the source logical 
volume is limited to a brief period once per day, starting at 23:20; at 
all other times the source logical volume is mounted read-only.  The 
snapshot logs grow to about 3GB per snapshot volume before the oldest 
snapshot is removed.  So far, so good.
Unfortunately, the box falls over every few days doing this; it has 
lasted anywhere from 1 day to over 1 week.  Also, memtest completes one 
pass with 0 errors.  I got the following in the syslog before the latest 
hang:

Mar 11 23:48:26 dailies last message repeated 81 times
Mar 11 23:49:27 dailies last message repeated 48 times
Is what I'm doing with the multiple snapshots supported and/or sane?  I 
found very little information in the various LVM howtos, Sistina, and 
google on creating multiple snapshots from a single LV.

Brian
