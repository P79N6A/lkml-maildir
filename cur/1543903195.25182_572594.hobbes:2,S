It's not good practice to do assert(expression-with-side-effects).  Because
if someone wants to create a build which has all the assertions disabled,
the resulting binary will not work.
In the present implementation our BUG_ON(expression) will evaluate
`expression' even if CONFIG_BUG=n.  But that's totally lame and we are just
leaving optimisation opportunities on the floor.
Our objective _should_ be to make BUG_ON(expr) generate no code at all if
CONFIG_BUG=n.
So please, prefer to do
	if (bind_irq_vector(irq, vector))
		BUG();
