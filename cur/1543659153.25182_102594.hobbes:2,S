STOP THIS F*CKING MADNESS ALREADY.
If you send BK patches, at least do it right, and make sure your BK patch 
is a proper child of something I actually _have_, so that I don't get 
results like:
	takepatch: can't find parent ID
	        perex@suse.cz|ChangeSet|20030111100546|48939
	        in RESYNC/SCCS/s.ChangeSet
and if you only want to send the patch and not use BK merges, then don't 
even bother to _use_ the BK merge stuff.
