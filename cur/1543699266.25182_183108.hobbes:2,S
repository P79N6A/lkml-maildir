Hi,
I'd like to draw everyone's attention back to an issue last discussed
back on the 16th November regarding cryptoloop + highmem causing a crash
of the system.  I am using 2.6.0-test11 on a Dual Athlon 1800+/1gb ram
(more system specs available on request).
>From my searches of the LKML, this was not resolved.  I too have this
issue, where using cryptoloop on my system with highmem compiled in
causes the system to crash.  I have also noticed other side-effects
aswell (for example processes like grep core-dumping for no reason,
which does not happen normally) that only a reboot of the system fixes.
I have not tried compiling OUT highmem, as I have 1gb ram, and unless
something has changed, I need to have highmem compiled in or I will
sacrifice about 128mb ram (if this is not the case, and I can get the
full 1gb ram, I will disable highmem in a heartbeat).  
I noticed in the last thread, Linus asked for gcc -v output, so here is
mine in advance:

Thread model: posix
gcc version 3.3.2 20031022 (Gentoo Linux 3.3.2-r3, propolice)
This is causing me great problems, since I need the usage of my crypto
loopback filesystems.  If you require any further information, or wish
me to perform some tests, etc - I'd be more than happy to help.
Thanks,
