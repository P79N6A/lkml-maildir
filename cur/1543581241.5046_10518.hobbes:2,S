Think of random disk io scattered across the disk.  Think about aio_write
providing a means to perform zero copy io without needing to resort to
playing mm tricks write protecting pages in the user's page tables.  It's
also a means for dealing efficiently with thousands of outstanding
requests for network io.  Using a select based interface is going to be an
ugly kludge that still has all the overhead of select/poll.
