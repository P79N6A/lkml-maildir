Here's the commit with the patch from Eric that I pushed out (I had 
thought I'd already applied it for rc2, but I obviously hadn't. Blush. 
It's there now in -git, but obviously not in the -rc2 release).
It's got the explanation too.

    [PATCH] x86_64/i386 irq: Fix !CONFIG_SMP compilation
    
    When removing set_native_irq I missed the fact that it was
    called in a couple of places that were compiled even when
    SMP support is disabled.  And since the irq_desc[].affinity
    field only exists in SMP things broke.
    
    Thanks to Simon Arlott <simon@arlott.org> for spotting this.
    
    There are a couple of ways to fix this but the simplest one
    is to just remove the assignments.  The affinity field is only
    used to display a value to the user, and nothing on either i386
    or x86_64 reads it or depends on it being any particlua value,
    so skipping the assignment is safe.  The assignment that
    is being removed is just for the initial affinity value before
    the user explicitly sets it.  The irq_desc array initializes
    this field to CPU_MASK_ALL so the field is initialized to
    a reasonable value in the SMP case without being set.
