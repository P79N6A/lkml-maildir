CF memory cards can be in either TrueIDE mode or PCMCIA mode. If you
only need to support memory cards, you should always use True-IDE
mode, because that offers a _much_ higher throughput with PIO mode
6 (25 MB/s) or UDMA mode 6 (133MB/s), compared to the PIO mode 0
(3.3 MB/s) in PCMCIA mode.
Of course, if the bus can only sustain PIO mode 0 anyway, you can
just as well do a PCMCIA driver, and get the ability to plug in
other cards, e.g. wlan or modem cards.
