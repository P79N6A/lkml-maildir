And the point is: comfortable work in console (bigger resolution ->
more information on screen), sometimes even with small fbtv window
in corner. And ability to run browsers like mozilla in X, when
it's needed. And ability to watch movies with mplayer in both.
 I don't understand why matroxfb has regressed in 2.6 compared to 2.4.
