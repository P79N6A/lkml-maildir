I tried already :) - I just made a allocations atomic in tcp_sendmsg() and
ended up with 1/4 of the sends blocking (I counted both allocation
failure and socket queue overflow). Those 20k blocked requests were
created in about 20 seconds, so roughly saying we have 1k of thread
creation/freeing per second - do we want this?

Before I started M:N threading library implementation I checked some
threading perfomance of the current POSIX library - I created simple
pool of threads and 'sent' a message between them using futex wait/wake
(sema_post/wait) one-by-one, results are quite dissapointing - given
that number of sleeping threads were about hundreds, kernel rescheduling
is about 10 times slower than setjmp based (I think so) used in Erlang.
Above example is not 100% correct, I understand, but situation with
thread-like AIO is much worse - it is possible that several threads will
be ready simultaneous, so rescheduling between them will kill a
performance.

Yes, it is ab and lighttpd, before it was httperf (unfair on high load
due to poll/select usage) and own web server (evserver_kevent.c).
