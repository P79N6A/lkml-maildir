Yes, I agree with you. When sbp2 is using the module count is not zero, 
so I can rmmod it, So I think, for sbp2 that's safe, That's true on my laptop.

There are tree places that reference ->unload_sem in linux kernel tree, but I
don't known, why the same code in 2.6.4 can works fine. :)
bus.c:68:       up(&drv->unload_sem);
driver.c:110:   down(&drv->unload_sem);
driver.c:111:   up(&drv->unload_sem);
