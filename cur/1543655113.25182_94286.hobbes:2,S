That's not true. acpi_wakeup.S is nasty piece of code, needed for S3
but not for S4. Big part of driver support is only needed for S3.

There were patches for S4bios floating around, but it never really
worked, IIRC.

What's ACPI side of S4 good for when you can not do S4?

S3 needs process stopper from kernel/suspend.c. I did not want to have
#ifdefs all over suspend.c...

I probably will not persuade you to make it CVS, right? [Sorry, I'm
not going to touch bitkeeper.]
