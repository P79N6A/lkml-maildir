Actually, I bet I know what's up.
Want to bet $5 USD that suspend/resume saves the keyboard A20 state, but
does NOT save the fast-A20 gate information?
So anything that enables A20 with only the fast A20 gate will find that
A20 is disabled again on resume.
Which would make Linux _really_ unhappy, needless to say. Instant death in
the form of a triple fault (all of the Linux kernel code is in the 1-2MB
area, which would be invisible), resulting in an instant reboot.
Peter, we definitely need to do the keyboard A20, even if fast-A20 works
fine.
