It was more of an attempt to cutdown on the number of recipients, not
any attempt to keep you out of the discussion.  This time, I've left
the recipients alone.

We are in agreement here, though I doubt that the CML1 ruleset really
achieves this goal in any serious way.  It just doesn't have the power.

Agreed.

I don't agree with this, since the current CML1 scheme has wierd,
unwanted and wrong dependencies already, which can't (or haven't) been
found.   Since it would be put in during the 2.5.x branching, it's
expected that things will/can/should break, so I don't think there
will be any dire consequences.

Such as what?  Do you have any examples here?

This is the first time you have come out and explicitly *said* what
you are for and against in CML2.  People need to be clear about what
they are talking about.
As a general question for all readers, how many are against CML2 in
any shape or form?
How many are like David, and don't mind CML2, but are worried about
dependency issues?
How many think CML2 and it's dependencies will be a step forward in
kernel configuration?
Thanks,
John
