I wonder if it's really worth it.
The original idea has some merit I think - but what you're suggesting
here is almost "bad block remapping" with transparent recovery and user
space policy agents etc. etc.
If a drive has problems reading the platter, it can usually be corrected
by overwriting the given sector (either the drive can actually overwrite
the sector in place, or it will re-allocate it with severe read
performance penalties following). But there's a reason why that sector
went bad, and you realy want to get the disk replaced.
I think the current policy of marking the disk as failed when it has
failed is sensible.
