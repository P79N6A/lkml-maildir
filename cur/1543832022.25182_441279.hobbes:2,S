Can set MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS=1000 if it is as you say. You will see huge
number of created pdflush threads created. That is why I consider that
MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS=8 is fast-fix patch-up which is used now as an
argument contra parallelism.

Quite the contrary in current design: synchronous write-out is started
first and after pdflush is waked up and it sees that all done.

Just after patching pdflush is used REALLY for writing out of dirty
pages concurrently with user thread work.

It doesn't work for you because you have not run it. Have you tried to
run any real kernel with proposed path and without?

I ask one more: why is it 48. Does it make best performance for any
configuration? You explanation is: 48 because it is 32+16. Is it
explanation? Is it proving?
This patch makes performance benefits for current REAL hardware and
software state and opens new performance benefits in smp. The patch was
carefully benchmarked on several configurations: 1-8 cpu; 1-8Gb memory;
1-15 disks.
You have proposed tens far-fetched contra arguments. I have explained
carefully that each your argument is ungrounded.

No, no, I was commenting on your (incorrect) statement that kernel "was
patched up by introducing MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS=8". It never was: this
limit is part of the original design, not some "patch".

Because this is not needed for current pdflush usage patterns. pdflush
is used for light background write-out, and small number of pdflush
threads is able to achieve necessary IO concurrency level, because they
are mostly non-blocking, thanks to the current_is_pdflush() checks. If
asynchronous write-out cannot cope with the rate of dirtying,
synchronous write-out starts.
You, on the other hand, are trying to use pdflush for the goal it wasn't
designed for. No wonder it doesn't work.

You didn't look carefully enough. :-)
/*
 * When balance_dirty_pages decides that the caller needs to perform
some
 * non-background writeback, this is how many pages it will attempt to
write.
 * It should be somewhat larger than RATELIMIT_PAGES to ensure that
reasonably
 * large amounts of I/O are submitted.
 */
static inline long sync_writeback_pages(void)
{
	return ratelimit_pages + ratelimit_pages / 2;
}
ratelimit_pages = 32, hence, sync_writeback_pages() returns 48. It could
be different, of course, if ratelimit_pages were.

No, I think the fewer hard-coded constants are here---the better. I'd
happily eliminate MAX_PDFLUSH_THREADS, but just dropping this constraint
is a non-solution in search of a problem, obviously.
But this discussion is degenerating, so I shall participate in it no
longer.
