As discussed a few times before, I'm still not really excited about adding a 
new LSM hook in skb_recv_datagram() when we already have hooks to control 
locally consumed network traffic.  However, I will admit that these existing 
hooks do not allow the LSM to block and query userspace for an access 
decision like you are trying to do with TOMOYO.  I would prefer not to see 
this new LSM hook added but I do not have an alternative solution to your 
problem so I can't in good conscience completely object to this patch.
Regardless, I have a few comments which are included below ...

With this patch the 'cpu_flags' variable will be used in two different 
if-blocks in this function and declared locally within each block.  Please 
move the 'cpu_flags' declaration to the top of the function so it only needs 
to be declared once.

I might be missing something here, but why do you need to do a skb_peek() 
again?  You already have the skb and the sock, just do the unlink.

Two things.  First you can probably just call kfree_skb() instead of 
skb_free_datagram().  Second, why not move the 'no_peek' code to just 
before 'no_packet'?
