On hard disks, yes, but as you suggested, there are lots of other flash
devices interfaced as block devices. CompactFlash comes to mind, USB
keys too. And on these ones, the most important is to reduce the number
of writes and to support large sizes. I already see LogFS as an interesting
alternative to JFFS2 on such devices, eventhough it does not (yet?) support
compression.
