Yes, it works fine: btime stays at the correct value. Just the
ps-output-in-future-problem left.
Linux-2.6.1+patch without ntpd:
 passed time according to 'date':               11430.68524 s
 timer interrupts:                              11432383
 interrupts per second:                         1000.149
 error compared to 1000 interrupts per second:  +149 ppm
 ps times go towards future about 2.0 s:  about 170 ppm
 btime stays constant!
 clock too fast compared to ntp time by:        +0.260461 s
 so 'date' is too fast compared to UT by:       +22.8 ppm
Linux-2.6.1+patch with ntpd:
 passed time according to 'date':               14792.60765 s
 timer interrupts:                              14795154
 interrupts per second:                         1000.172
 error compared to 1000 interrupts per second:  +172 ppm
 ps times go towards future about 2.7 s:  about 180 ppm
 btime stays constant!
