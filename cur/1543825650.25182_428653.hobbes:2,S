Problem is: it messes up design for everyone else. (And no, Santiago,
most people are not using vgacon. Most people use vesafb these days,
because that's what allows whole screen to be used, not just 80x25).
fbcon is simple enough. Okay, vgacon may be useful for recovery, but
supporting accelerated 3D over vgacon is quite crazy.
