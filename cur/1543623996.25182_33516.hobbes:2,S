Yes please.  I've been working with at least 4 different National
Semiconductor Geode based designs so far, and they will get more and
more common I belive.  It'd be nice not having to crap in the rest of
the i386 tree just because one system has its own bootloader or
special motherboard.
I just got my SC2200 based board booting with LinuxBIOS, so I'll
probably have to do a special kernel initialization that does some
board-specific setup since there is no BIOS to do that.

Couldn't this be done with a common subroutine library, such as
arch/i386/common that contains code to set up the interrupt controller
and such.  The PC platform code just includes everything, other
platforms could be a bit more choosy, have its own bootloader and
memory detection code and just skip the BIOS calls.
