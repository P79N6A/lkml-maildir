   This is all well and good, and yes I'll definitely use this. The question
   though is "Is this available to a driver as a linux driver ABI type
   call?". The answer has to be "not yet" I'd guess.
Are you looking for the ability to generate a 128 UUID in kernel space?
If so, my first reaction would be why.... a UUID is needed when you need
an ID which is universally unique across all time and all space and all
machines in the world.  What are the properties of an ID which you are
looking for, and why does the driver need to assign such a thing?
128-bit UUID are rather heavyweight objects, and if you don't need all
of the properties which they guarantee, something ligherweight might be
more appropriate.
