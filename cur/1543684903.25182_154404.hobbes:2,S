Hm, ".." points back to a directory in its parent path (in fact simply its own
parent). You don't call this a loop? How come?
If I write a simple program that follows all directory entries of a given
directory it will simply loop, it only won't loop if I tell it explicitely
_not_ to follow ".." and ".", because "." is nothing else but the shortest
possible loop.
