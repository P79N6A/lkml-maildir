Did you ever figure this out?
It looks like you're mixing two completely seperate bugs.  The ata
timeouts and the lost ticks messages.

This is causing the sata failures:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=190856
Downgrade to match your other system (version 1.01).  That will fix

I'm still interested in the lost ticks messages though...
