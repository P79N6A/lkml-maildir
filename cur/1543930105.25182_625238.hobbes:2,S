The cache in struct file doesn't need to be refreshed unless rewinddir()
is issued. Also you can maintain the cache in every add/del entries,
instead of discarding the cache entirely.

Yes, I had such idea once. And copy-up too. They can be done in
userspace (while you need to be careful about the privilege).
Anyway I agree with you. As I wrote before, this approach consumes a lot
of memory and cpu (for comparing whiteouted names).
