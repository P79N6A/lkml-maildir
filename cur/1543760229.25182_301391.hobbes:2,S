There is a benchmark for UP on
http://oss.sgi.com/projects/page_fault_performance.

Spinlocks also require atomic operations like a lock decb on i386 in order
to acquire the locks. And the page_table_lock is acquired two
times in the page fault handler. In order for this to be faster
2*spinlock acquisition and release would have to be faster than a cmpxchg.

The numbers on the webpage are for an AMD64. But I can try
to get some testing done on a P4 too.
