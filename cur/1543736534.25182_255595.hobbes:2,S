OK, on the 2.4.27 machine, lspci displays an entry for the SMBus device
(once the p4b_smbus module is loaded), thus:
0000:00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corp. 82801DB/DBL/DBM (ICH4/ICH4-L/ICH4-M) SMBus
Controller (rev 01)
which lspci -n identifies as 
0000:00:1f.3 Class 0c05: 8086:24c3 (rev 01)
In pci_ids.h, 0x0c05 is "PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_SMBUS", and "24c3" is a
"PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801DB_3".  So, thanks to your help, I've found the
dev->device entry I need; but where do I get the dev->subsystem_device value
from?  I'm willing to believe I have the information and that I just don't
recognise what it is - that is my problem.
Thanks for the help so far, though!

(Deep Sigh).  A standard disclaimer inserted by my workplace's email
gateway, I'm afraid.  I have no control over this.  Would it help if I added
the following ?
Despite any later disclaimer to the contrary, this email is not confidential
and does not contain privleged material.
Thanks,
