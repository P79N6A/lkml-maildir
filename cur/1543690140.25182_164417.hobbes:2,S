Unfortunately, we don't have a 'taint' flag for when extra patches are 
added to an official release. 
The latter two functions do not exist in -test5. It would helpful if you 
tried to reproduce with a virgin -test5. It would be courteous to state 
what patches you applied on top of the virgin -test5 kernel. 
The entire Oops would also help, captured either by hand or with e.g. a 
digital camera. You may want to cc the usb-devel list, too.
Thanks,
	Pat
