Well, i just wanted to get some information about this patch. It has
been posted here already in september if i am not wrong, and there were
various comments, but nothing conclusive in a way or the other, so i was

I never dreamed about it. I was just curious about the vailidy of the
patch per se, not really its inclusion into the main trees or not.
Anyway, thanks for the information you provided, things are clearer for
me now.
