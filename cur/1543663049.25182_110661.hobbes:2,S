Well, it's only a safeguard against suspending / resuming combined with 
probing or removing the device. Else it's a BUG indeed...

Only one s_info is actually allocated (in cs.c::pcmcia_register_socket) as
only one pcmcia/cardbus socket is attached to one pci_dev for yenta-style
devices. There are up to four pcmcia sockets to one pci_dev for i82092
devices, though. And so s_info[3] might be perfectly valid within the
i82092 driver.
