You really need to watch out when using ReiserFS as an NFS server.  There
are patches to NFS in order to run on ReiserFS.  There were also problems
(they may be fixed now) that force the NFS clients to be Linux only.
You should ask the reiserfs mailing list for outstanding problems.  As
far as LVM is concerned, I don't think there is a problem, but watch out
for software RAID 5 and journalling filesystems (reiser or ext3, at least
under 2.2) - it can have problems if there is a disk crash.
Cheers, Andreas
