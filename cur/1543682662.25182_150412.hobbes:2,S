Look how swsusp handles it: we switch to text console (which means X
gets told to bring vga card to some sane state). We should do the same
for S3.
I'm using vesafb, which needs no special support for suspend/resume
;-). [And its very good for system stability; with notebook's LCD I
don't care about low refresh (1).]

(1). I've seen notebooks LCD flashing at 25Hz, but VESA modes are
fortunately better than *that*.
