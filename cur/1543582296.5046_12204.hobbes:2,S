Keeping their legacy customer base on their products. Showing a
migration path that stays on their products and does not move to M$ or
another vendor.

Their own hardware.

They want to stay in business. They don't want to lose their
customers. I remember an interview with an IBM exec which went along
the lines "We're supporting 25 different OS. Linux is OS #26. So, no
news for us here".

It means "keep my customer base happy with me, so they give me more
bucks".
I'm sure, that their business plan with Linux says "we get two bucks
for every every one that we spend". IBM is an iron vendor. They have a
strong software product line but their first target is selling "IBM
software on an IBM supported OS on IBM hardware". And if the "IBM
supported OS" is not M$ Windows, which they have to pay a license fee
for but a "license-free OS" which is even developed for them, it's
good for them. And they get "community recognition" and a good press
thrown in for free.
It's "win - win" for them. And, BTW, for us and Linux too, which is a
good thing.

P.S.: Oh, look a me. Living in an environment where IBM are the good
guys. The horrors. The horrors. ;-)
