> I'm sure you can do something similar for dmcrypt.
yes, there is....but just like you dislike my way, I disliked the approach you
mentioned (which is actually, how I've set up rootfs encryption
in the past here at work - due to the lack of an alternative approach).
i just find my approach more suitable (from a philosophical design point of
view) - as it provides a generic way for submitting sensitive data
during/before the boot phase to the kernel.
