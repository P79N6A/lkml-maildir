I have now looked further, and both points still seem valid to me:
the page_mkwrite calling code looks doubly broken.  (Tested?)
Nor has there been any movement on the points raised by Christoph,
that aops->page_mkwrite is redundant, and do_wp_page_mk_pte_writable
separation unhelpful.
I could probably put page_mkwrite to use in tmpfs (to eliminate its
unsatisfactory but never over-troubling shmem_recalc_inode), but not
as it currently stands.
Are you planning any movement on this, David?
Or should I have a go sometime?
Hugh
