Now, that's a really nice comparison!

As for really safety critical stuff, it definitely does. I know from personal 
experience what it takes to certify software for use in aircrafts. Believe 
me, there is no chance that Linux as we know it could ever pass a DO-178B 
certification process. And for software in aircraft, that is a requirement. 
(Mind you, any form of Windoze doesn't stand a chance either). Similar 
regulations apply to other fields (such as medical devices) and it would 
scare me if that wasn't so. Just do a web search for "Therac-25" if you are 
interested in a (sad) story about what can happen if software in a medical 
device goes wrong.

As long as the machine only *monitors*, that may be possible. If the machine 
were to e.g. administer medication, that would be a totally different story.
