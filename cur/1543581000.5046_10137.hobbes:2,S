Sure.  Run devfsd (devfs daemon), and set up a good /etc/devfsd.conf
devfsd.conf can specify ownership and permissions instead of the
default created by the driver.  I get /dev/sound/dsp owned
by group "audio", and my non-root user is a member of that group.
devfsd.conf also specify which devices to create compatibility
symlinks for.  The default seems to be all, but you may
decide to create symlinks for only those devices that really need it,
such as sound.
Read the docs for devfsd and devfsd.conf.
