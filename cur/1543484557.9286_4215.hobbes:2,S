    I believe that this bug has existed for some time
Let us say `flaw'.
    PROBLEM:
    If one sets the "Solaris (x86) partition table support" option from the
    partion sub-menue in xconfig (which sets the define
    CONFIG_SOLARIS_X86_PARTITION) then one ends up with a kernel that will not
    boot without significant fiddling.
More generally:
PROBLEM:
If one adds or removes partitions or disks then the numbering of the
remaining partitions and/or disks changes.

    For reference, here is how hda is partitioned
            hda1 Win98
            hda2 FreeBSD
            hda3 Solaris
            hda4 Extended
            hda5 (unused)
            hda6 Linux
            hda7 Linux swap
    During a `normal' boot I see the messages
            ...
            Partition Check:
            hda: hda1 hda2! hda3 hda4 < hda5 hda6 hda7 > < hda8 hda9 hda10 hda11 >
            hdc: [PTBL] [778/255/63] hdc3
            VFS: Mounted root (ext2 filesystem) readonly.
            ...
    Right off I have two questions:
        (a) what does the `!' on hda2 imply?
        (b) where do the bogus partitions hda8 - 11 come from?
Hmm. Let us look at the source - genhd.c.
The ! indicates a *BSD partition (when CONFIG_BSD_DISKLABEL is defined)
So, you have primary partitions hda1-hda4.
Looking inside the extended partition the kernel finds hda5-7.
Looking inside the FreeBSD partition the kernel finds hda8-11.
    If I invoke the Solaris options above, then at the same point in the boot
    I see
            Partition Check:
            hda: hda1 hda2! hda3 <Solaris: [s0] hda5 [s1] hda6 [s2] hda7 [s3] hda8
                [s4] hda9 [s6] hda10 [s7] hda10 >
                hda4 < hda12 hda13 hda14 > < hda15 hda16 hda17 hda18 >
            hdc: [PTBL] [778/255/63] hdc3
            Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:06
    So now it is showing me my SOLARIS (sub)partitions.
    So a question
        (c) Why does it show my SOLARIS partions and not my FreeBSD partitions?
            Yes I have BSD Disklabel support turned on.
        (d) note that there are now bogus partitions hda15-18.
But (d) is the answer to (c): these FreeBSD partitions that you
cannot find are the hda15-18 that you complain about.
So, here: you have primary partitions hda1-hda4.
Looking inside the Solaris partition the kernel finds hda5-10.
Looking inside the extended partition the kernel finds hda12-14.
Looking inside the FreeBSD partition the kernel finds hda15-18.
    If I CHANGE /etc/lilo.conf to contain `root=/dev/hda13' to override the
    incorrect info in the kernel, I get a few lines further in the boot.
    If I then ALSO change /etc/fstab to point to /dev/hda13 (rather than
    /dev/hda6) and /dev/hda14 (rather than /hda7) for swap, then I can in fact
    boot the kernel.
    At that point I CAN mount /dev/hda5 and get to my SOLARIS root file system.
All entirely as expected.
First conclusion: if you enable/disable CONFIG_*_PARTITION then you
must be prepared to handle a change in partition numbers.
No doubt it is less than optimal that the CONFIG_BSD_DISKLABEL implementer
was careful to place FreeBSD slices at the end of the partition list
while the CONFIG_SOLARIS_X86_PARTITION implementer failed to do so.
Probably we should change this, so that at least the `basic' partitions
are numbered independently of whether we look inside `foreign' partitions.
One could also imagine entirely different schemes, where FreeBSD slices
do not live in the same name space as DOS-type partitions.
This is perhaps easiest done when we finally get large device numbers.
