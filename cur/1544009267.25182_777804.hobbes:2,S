    Bluetooth: Remove deprecated hci_usb driver
    The old hci_usb driver has been fully replaced with the new btusb driver
    and all major distributions switched to the new driver now. This removes
    it since it should not be used at all anymore.
so please confirm that btusb correctly supports that hardware?
