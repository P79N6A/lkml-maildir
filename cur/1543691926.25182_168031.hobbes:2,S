What exactly are you trying to do? do you need it to be done on a
system wide level (socket in general) or per application (a specific
socket)?
If it's per socket, just use strace. No kernel hacking
required(TM). If it's system wide, apart from the other options
mentioned in this thread, you can also use syscalltrack
(
http://syscalltrack.sf.net
). Depending on what you want to do, it may
or may not be the best tool for the job. Note that it doesn't support
2.5 yet, but we're working on it. 
Cheers,
