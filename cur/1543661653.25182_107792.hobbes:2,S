The ifdef is the right way around. KBD_DEFLEDS used to be 0. Now
KBD_DEFLEDS is also 0, except when CONFIG_X86_PC9800 is defined. Note
it's an if*n*def there.

Yes. Send me a patch that does this, and I'll happily merge it in.

Hmm. I know this isn't the prefered way of doing it, but so far it's the
most convenient one - serio.h still changes now and then (adding new
#defines, etc), and the only one program using it is inputattach.c. To
me it seems quite sane to have inputattach.c include this kernel header.
If you know of any other reasonably maintainable way to do it ...
