It's been around for two years, but if you fix x86_64 to use
early_param(), and I'll patch the other setup_archs to call
parse_early_param and remove the init/main.c call 8)

setup_arch is responsible for grabbing the command line, so that has to
happen first.  Even on x86, functions later in setup_arch rely on
cmdline parsing having happened.  So for the moment setup_arch has to
call parse_early_param.
Maybe one day we can create a new "char *arch_get_cmdline()", implement
that everywhere, then call it and parse_early_param from core code.  But
baby steps...
Rusty.
