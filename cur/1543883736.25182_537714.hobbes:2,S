The point is that Uwe patch will generate regressions by breaking for 
Twinhan. His patch just removes compilation for dst and dst_ca on Kconfig, 
without taking care or driver internals. So, two initialization functions 
won't be called by symbol_request(). Although those two functions will be 
undefined, as the dvb will do the linkedition at module runtume (if 
DVB_ATTACH is selected), modprobe won't detect the lack of those functions.
At the end, cards with ST chips (DST and/or DST CA) will stop working, 
without even printing a warning.
I've tried to explain this to Uwe several times, but, at the end, he 
always start insulting me and/or other developers.
Cheers,
Mauro.
