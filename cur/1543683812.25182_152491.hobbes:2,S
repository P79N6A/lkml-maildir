What about Mandrake people ? Whats wrong with testing prerelease
software ?
I hope you just use release kernels, -pres are only for Mandrake people

I would understand you if it were a bug in the compiler, if it it cried
against obviously correct code, but it just says
that the assembler syntax is old and you should change it.
Any ways, let it be. You just will have to hurry when real 3.3.1 or 3.4
