It doesn't need to be asm/ - it can all be generic.  You just have
<linux/uid16_convert.h> be the unconditional macro definitions.
<linux/highuid.h> can conditionally include that.  Only downside is that you
have to define the NOP version of the macros in highuid.h, but it's not like
these are growing or evolving.
I'm fine with that or manually defining CONFIG_UID16 - it is really for
special cases.  I just loathe duplicated code :)
