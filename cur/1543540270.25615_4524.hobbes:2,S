I don't know if this counts as a "compatibility error", but here goes:
       * In 2.4.0testX(preY) (ranging from 3,8 to 5,3 at the very least, and
         probably also including at least some earlier and later kernels),
         there's a problem when trying to compile 2.0.38: make dep fails
         with an Error 135. This does not happen when trying to compile
         2.0.38 under 2.2.x.
Unfortunately, I don't have time to submit a full report for the above bug,
and I've come to the conclusion that I won't have time for a while
(therefore my incomplete report now, in the hope that it will be useful to
someone out there...).
