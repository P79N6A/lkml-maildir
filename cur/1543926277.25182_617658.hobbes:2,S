I found patch from about three years ago that implemented a 32-bit
version of the x86_64 machine check handler. Do you know of any newer
attempts?
However, given the merge of x86, a single implementation should be able
to handle both the 32-bit and 64-bit cases. I tried to build the 64-bit
machine check handler (mce_64.c) for 32-bit to see what kind problems it
would run into. So far I found a few things:
- there is no idle_notifier_register in 32-bit x86
- there is no oops_begin in 32-bit x86
- register names are different (rip, cs)
- some data types would have to adjusted to be 64 bit 
The issues seem to be surmountable.

So it looks like giving 32-bit x86 the same machine check support as in
64-bit is both feasible and desirable.
Are there any plans to do this or is anybody currently working on it?
thanks,
