And here's my report (almost no numbers, everything is purely subjective).
I haven't tested Con's O18.1 yet, so my comparision is against -test4 vanilla.
First (and most subjective opinion) - great. Under casual load (Opera 
rendering page and using its motifwrapper to handle flash (it's a CPU hog 
alone) + ocassional compilation + XMMS using ALSA ) everything feels very 
smooth _and_ responsive, no XMMS jerks, windows are moving nicely - X is 
definitely not starved, ps ax in xterm displays its output almost instantly, 
apps startup time is also very pleasantly low - all in all great. 
Unusual load (make -j 4 bzImage + aforementioned activity ) - I was able to 
notice 1 jerk in XMMS (wasn't able to reproduce, so this is acceptable), 
application startup time is slightly worse, but nonetheless useable and once 
started, all apps are quite smooth, but X is definitely starved, and it has 
great impact on WM - window movement is jerky and feels bad. However, renice 
-20 <X pid> cures this behavior completely, without any noticeable penalty on 
another apps - music is playing nicely, page rendering is still clean and 
nice.
Overall - very nice. 
I'll stick to your scheduling policy for a while .
System specs:
IBM ThinkPad T21, PIII-800Mhz , 256Mb. 
Linux 2.6.0-test4, APM, ALSA, anticipatory IO scheduling
XFree 4.3.99.9 
P.S. make clean && make -j 4 bzImage completed while I was writing this 
letter, so I'm assuming throughput is also OK for me.
