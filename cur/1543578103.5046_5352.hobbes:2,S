i know the performance advantages of jumbograms (typically when it's over
a local network), it's undisputed. Still i dont see why it should be
impossible to do effective UDP via a single-page interface. Eg. buffering
of outgoing pages could be supported, and MSG_MORE in sendmsg() used to
indicate end of stream. This is why ->writepage() has a 'more' flag (and
tcp_sendpage() has a flag as well).
