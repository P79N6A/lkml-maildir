Problem is, that fixing fbcon is hard. Scrolling is operation that can
take 500msec. If printk() wants guarantees about being able to print
any time, whole fbcon has to be cli-ed even for normal
operation. Ouch.
Or we could give something up. Like giving up printk altogether [not
good] or declaring that printk is emergency-only and may mess up
screen.

This was not argument in favor of new low-latency features (or I did
not want it to be).
