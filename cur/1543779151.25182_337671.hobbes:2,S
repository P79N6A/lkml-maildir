Please don't take this as harassment, but this mailing list [LKML] is 
archieved all over the internet... In order for people to see your 
patch, you should re-send your patch to the list as INLINE text, or as a 
text attachment.  My mailer sends my text attachments as inline text, 
but I don't think every mailer does the same...
Most people on this list will be happy to look at your patch and harass 
you / applaud you about it, but only if they don't have to jump through 
hoops in order to see it ;-)
keep patching...
