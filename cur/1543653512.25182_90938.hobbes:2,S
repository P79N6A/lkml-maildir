Are you running with memory mapped I/O enabled?  Since you have a VIA
chipset, using memory mapped I/O can be problematic.  If using PIO
works for you, I'd like to work with you toward making the memory mapped
I/O test in the driver automatically detect configurations such as yours
that do not function correctly when mem I/O is used.  You should be able
to disable mmap I/O in 6.2.21 via kernel config or by setting an aic7xxx
option on the command line (nomemio I think, but I don't have the sources
in front of me right now).
