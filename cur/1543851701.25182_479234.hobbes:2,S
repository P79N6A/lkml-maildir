Actually, it might be better to wait with this - it is the last resort
option, if there is nothing else to try.

Can you try with ohci-hcd loaded (and without irqpoll)?  USB
controllers might cause such problems, because BIOSen often do weird
things with them for legacy emulation; however, loading a proper
driver should make BIOS stop messing with the hardware behind the back
of the OS.
After loading ohci-hcd look which IRQ does the USB controller use - if
it is the same IRQ as the qstor card, you should keep ohci-hcd loaded
to avoid problems.  (If it is on some other IRQ, loading ohci-hcd
might still help - the code for enabling the PCI device calls ACPI
BIOS, which might change interrupt routing setup in the chipset.)
Also look for something like "USB Keyboard Support" and maybe "USB
Mouse Support" in BIOS setup - some BIOS versions have severe problems
with this emulation, so it may be better to disable it unless you
really need it.
Disabling USB in the BIOS setup if you really don't need might be
another option.

These devices seem to be disabled, but if loading ohci-hcd does not
help, you can try to load the sym53c8xx driver and look whether it
ends up on the same IRQ as qstor.
