I wasn't talking about mounting the same device on different mount points.
If you ask for that, it's good that you nowadays you can get that (though
even there it might be a good idea to let the filesystem say if it can
support that or not)
I was talking about avoiding that the same device gets multiple mounted 
at the SAME place, e.g. when doing mount -a, which is often used as a
quick way to get the new entries in /etc/fstab
That would also be no problem if there were a standard about e.g. always
flocking /etc/mtab. But as far as I know there isn't such a standard.
