This one makes me worry a little bit.  Are we sure that this won't
expose a wee bit too much to userspace?
I can see it making sense to clear the page refs, then inspect whether
the page has been referenced again.  But, I worry that people are going
to start doing things like read NUMA, SPARSEMEM, or other internal
information out of these.
I've seen quite a few patches lately that do creative things with these
*cough*clameter*cough*, and I worry that they're too fluid to get
exposed to userspace.
Could we just have /proc/kpagereferenced?  Is there a legitimate need
for other flags to be visible?
