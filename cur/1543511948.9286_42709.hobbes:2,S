	Just to note, it apparently no longer does the tarball evil-ness,
instead has a config file that is used to set the permissions on the devices,
of course, this isn't updated by chown/chmod, but I imagine it might be able
to be, but then, that may get kind of ugly...  What are your thoughts?

	devfs, for me at least, is mostly about having a nicer, cleaner /dev
nodes, ones that make more sense. (c1t1d0s0-style, not this /dev/sd[a,b,c]
junk).  Either way here, that's policy, not much you can do to avoid that
either.  Having the dynamic filesystem is somewhat handy as well, esp when
you start dealing w/ dynamic devices (PCMCIA, USB, etc).
	100kb on a 1.4m floppy is a pain, 100kb out of 4m or 8m of memory
doesn't seem as bad.  for embedded systems, it may be easier to use one over
the other, but either way you still use the 100kb.

	Hardly.  The way this appears to be handled to me is you do the stupid
simple thing, you ask the hardware.  The name is based off of the controller
(Which there SHOULD be, but I'm not sure is, some deterministic way of finding
out which would be appropriate, based on the hardware, to come first), the
physical scsi target or ID, the physical LUN, and the partition on the disk
(As detected by the kernel).  This makes it MUCH easier to debug problems on a
large system, because you know right off what disk is acting up.
