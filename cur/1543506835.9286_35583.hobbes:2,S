why don't we write a 'bot that moderates this mailing list, and when
it sees a bug report from someone with overclocked cpus, it simply 
deletes them?  :)
This is nonsense.  You say "don't comment, it works for you" but
does it _really_?
Overclocking causes more system/program/etc failures than any other
single cause I have seen.  And it is a big waste of time trying to
find a bug, only to discover that the cpu is clocked 50% beyond
the Intel spec.
