Linux can already provide a response time within < 3 usecs from user space 
using f.e. the Altix RTC driver which can generate an interrupt that then 
sends a signal to an application. The Altix RTC clock is supported via POSIX
timer syscalls and can be accessed using CLOCK_SGI_CYCLE. This has been 
available in Linux since last fall and events can be specified with 50 
nanoseconds accurary.
Other clock sources like  HPET could do the same if someone would be 
willing to provide the hookup to the posix layer.
I doubt that increasing the timer frequency is the way to go to solve 
these issues. HZ should be as low as possible and we should strive for a 
tickless system.
