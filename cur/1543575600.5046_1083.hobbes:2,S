version.h is an auto-generated file (see the first four lines of the
toplevel Makefile for the correct version definition).  It is generated
when you compile the kernel.  If you unpacked the tree (or patched a
2.2.17 tree) *without* compiling anything, version.h (and compile.h,
which is created at about the same time) will be either missing or
wrong.
