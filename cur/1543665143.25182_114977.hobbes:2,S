Oh, well. I didn't actually even verify that UNIX domain sockets will
cause synchronous wakeups, so the patch may literally be doing nothing at
all. You can try that theory out by just removing the test for 
"in_interrupt()".
It will also almost certainly be totally ineffective if you use TCP 
sockets for the same reason. So if your DISPLAY variable is set to 
"localhost:0" instead of ":0.0", you'd definitely have to remove the 
"in_interrupt()" test.
But it may also just be that the theory is just broken.
