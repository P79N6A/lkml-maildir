Can someone explain me why 2.4.18 runs fine with 
# CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX is not set
but ac1 (and 2) require
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX=y
It's correct that 2.4.18-ac? requires the driver (my hd's are connected 
to an promise-UDMA-controller), but why runs 2.4.18 fine without this 
driver?

It is better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool, than to
open it and remove all doubt.
