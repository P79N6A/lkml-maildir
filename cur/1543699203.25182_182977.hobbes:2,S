Yes, it was the differences between the i386 and x86_64 versions that 
made me notice this problem. The ia64 version is in C, so looks safer. 
Ideally there would be a common C definition - the only arch-specific 
part should be the locked cmpxchg, unless this lock is likely to be 
taken/released so often that it's performance critical.
