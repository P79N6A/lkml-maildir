You are missing the point here.  If a driver is "old style", where
owner==NULL and it manually calls MOD_{INC,DEC}_USE_COUNT, things are
pretty much ok.  There is a tiny race, but the system is mostly intact.
For never drivers "that matter," we update them to set
net_device::owner.  But to me breaking all the net drivers to force such
a change is silly.  For such a tiny race, there just isn't a pressing
need to update the stinkbomb crapola drivers...
