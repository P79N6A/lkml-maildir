You can't do this, at least not exactly this way.  io + 0x08 may not
be a mapped IO address; it is only valid when a card is mapped with
one contiguous 16-bit IO window.  PCMCIA IDE cards are not necessarily
mapped that way: they may be mapped with one 8-port window and one
1-port window, to match standard IBM PC IDE port locations.  In that
case, the registers at 0x08 and 0x09 are not available.  The CF spec
may impose more uniformity here than the PCMCIA spec does.  I do know
that some IDE cards do end up configured with discontiguous register
allocations when used with ide-cs.c.
