Thats consistent with the card not generating interrupts, or the
interrupts being misrouted. The serial driver polls the interrupt pending
bits on the chip so the actual serial chip is clearly expecting
interrupts to go somewhere. Given this seems to be card not laptop
specific it looks like there is magic intiialisation gloop required by
this chipset that we don't have.

You may want to boot with irqpoll that may help a bit.
Some info at: 
A helpful start would be to know if the setserial command (applied to
whatever tty your system calls the card) helps as given in:
