I think in most cases there would be possibility to embed 
sk_transaction_token to some higher level structure. E.g. Xen apparently 
should have something to track packets passed through host/guest 
boundary. From other side, kmem cache is too well polished to have much 
overhead. I doubt, you would even notice it in this application. In most 
cases allocation of such small object in it using SLUB is just about the 
same as a list_del() under disabled IRQs.
