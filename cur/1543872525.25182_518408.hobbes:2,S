OK, here's a more formal listing of my objections to the introduction of
timerfd in this form:
A) It is a new general-purpose ABI intended for wide-scale usage, and
thus must be maintained forever.
B) It is less functional than the existing ABIs -- modulo their
"delivery via signals only" limitation, which can be corrected (and has
been already in other operating systems).
C) Being an entirely new creation that completely ignores past work in
this area, it has no hope of ever getting into POSIX.
which means
D) At some point in time, Linux is going to get the POSIX version (in
whatever form it takes), making this new ABI useless dead weight (see
point A).
