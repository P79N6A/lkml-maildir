Hi David,
I have tested our Solera products on both Xeon and Opteron Processors. I 
can sustain 500 MB/S capture off the wire on 4 x 1000 Gigabit segments
due to the incredible performance of Xeon based I/O chipsets. My tests 
with Opteron based systems are sick in comparison. An Opteron 200 series 
CPU on a Tyan based motherbord system is discouraging on comparison. The 
Opteron systems will only sustain 150 MB/S with the same software.
The I/O chipset performance for disk and LAN I/O is purtrid compared to 
the 7500 series I/O chipsets.
