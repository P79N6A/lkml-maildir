Thanks for reposting it.

I wonder do we really need i_lock here for inode versioning update?
Understand this is a 64 bit counter, but file_update_time() and
ext4_mark_inode_dirty() (where the inode version is updated) is called
on the file write path so i_mutex should be hold all the time. As long
as the read patch holding i_mutex everything should be fine, isn't it?
Have you get a chance to check the performance impact to ext4?
