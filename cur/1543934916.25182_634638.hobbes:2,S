I remember I talked with Arjan about this time ago. Basically, since 1) 
you can drop an epoll fd inside another epoll fd 2) callback-based wakeups 
are used, you can see a wake_up() from inside another wake_up(), but they 
will never refer to the same lock instance.
Think about:
	dfd = socket(...);
	efd1 = epoll_create();
	efd2 = epoll_create();
	epoll_ctl(efd1, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, dfd, ...);
	epoll_ctl(efd2, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd1, ...);
When a packet arrives to the device underneath "dfd", the net code will 
issue a wake_up() on its poll wake list. Epoll (efd1) has installed a 
callback wakeup entry on that queue, and the wake_up() performed by the 
"dfd" net code will end up in ep_poll_callback(). At this point epoll 
(efd1) notices that it may have some event ready, so it needs to wake up 
the waiters on its poll wait list (efd2). So it calls ep_poll_safewake() 
that ends up in another wake_up(), after having checked about the 
recursion constraints. That are, no more than EP_MAX_POLLWAKE_NESTS, to 
avoid stack blasting. Never hit the same queue, to avoid loops like:
	epoll_ctl(efd2, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd1, ...);
	epoll_ctl(efd3, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd2, ...);
	epoll_ctl(efd4, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd3, ...);
	epoll_ctl(efd1, EPOLL_CTL_ADD, efd4, ...);
The code "if (tncur->wq == wq || ..." prevents re-entering the same 
queue/lock.
I don't know how the lockdep code works, so I can't say about 
wake_up_nested(). Although I have a feeling is not enough in this case.
A solution may be to move the call to ep_poll_safewake() (that'd become a 
simple wake_up()) inside a tasklet or whatever is today trendy for delayed 
work. But his kinda scares me to be honest, since epoll has already a 
bunch of places where it could be asynchronously hit (plus performance 
regression will need to be verified).
