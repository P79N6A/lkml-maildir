I'm seeing similar behavior with SCSI. I've got two SCSI channels. If I
run two dd's each talking to disks on different channels, I get 2x disk
bandwidth. If I run two dd's talking to disks on the same channel I get
1x disk bandwidth. This is with 2.4.9, but I haven't isolated which
kernel versions cause this.
This system has 8 U160 disks spread over 2 U160 channels and it hasn't
been deployed yet, so if I can help with testing, let me know.
