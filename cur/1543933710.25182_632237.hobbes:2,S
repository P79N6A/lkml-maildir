I added kerneldoc comments to some files and was a little surprised that
they didn't appear in make mandocs output. It turns out only functions in files
mentioned in Documentation/DocBook/*.tmpl are extracted. Since that's a 
pretty unknown requirement (at least I didn't know it) I suppose a lot
of the kerneldoc annotations actually are never generated because of this.
Should that be changed and let the scripts hunt for kerneldoc in all
source files?
A potential problem is that already the kerneldocs contain a lot 
of fairly useless driver internal funcions (e.g. nobody does care
a lot about internal MPT interfaces). But that problem is already
there and it's better to have too many than not enough in mandocs.
