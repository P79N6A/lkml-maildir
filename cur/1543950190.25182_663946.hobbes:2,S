This seems like a good subject to be paranoid about.  :-)

It looks very good.  Do you think there should be an "else" clause for 
the "if ((status & STS_IAA) || !(cmd & CMD_IAAD))" test?  That's the 
pathway one would observe with a controller that implements IAA very 
slowly or not at all.  There doesn't seem to be anything more the HCD 
can do about it, but you could print a log message.

There's still Bugzilla #8692.  That one appears to be an individual
hardware failure, though, not a systematic bug.

There is one place where ehci-hcd.c doesn't make that guarantee:
@@ -757,7 +757,7 @@ static void unlink_async (struct ehci_hcd *eh
 static void unlink_async (struct ehci_hcd *ehci, struct ehci_qh *qh)
 {
 	/* failfast */
-	if (!HC_IS_RUNNING(ehci_to_hcd(ehci)->state))
+	if (!HC_IS_RUNNING(ehci_to_hcd(ehci)->state) && ehci->reclaim)
 		end_unlink_async(ehci);
 
 	/* if it's not linked then there's nothing to do */
But if you take out the WARN_ON at the start of end_unlink_async then 
this isn't needed.
