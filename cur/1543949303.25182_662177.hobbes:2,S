The Coverity checker spotted the following bogus change to 
ide_register_hw() in commit 9e016a719209d95338e314b46c3012cc7feaaeec:
<--  snip  -->
...
+               hwif = ide_deprecated_find_port(hw->io_ports[IDE_DATA_OFFSET]);
+               index = hwif->index;
+               if (hwif)
+                       goto found;
                for (index = 0; index < MAX_HWIFS; index++)
...
<--  snip  -->
It's impossible to reach the for() loop without Oopsing before.
Can you either fix this for 2.6.25 or push your patch that removes 
ide_register_hw() for 2.6.25?
