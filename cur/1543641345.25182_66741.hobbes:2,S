I do like the atomic_inc, atomic_dec, etc being able to handle either 
type.  While producing code, I can do a simple check at the beginning of 
the block and define the appropriate type for a particular architecture.
For instance:
#if ARCH_WORD_SIZE == 8
atomic64_t my_atomic;
#else
atomic_t my_atomic;
#endif
Without it, I end up doing alot of other magic.  I don't see a problem 
with having the #defines versus the inlines.  Why have two chunks of code 
which do exactly the same operations with only type differences?
