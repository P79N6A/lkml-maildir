My first guess would be read ahead values.  Try poking around with
those.  When using a hard disk vs. a raid array, it's easier to trigger
firmware read ahead since all reads go to a single physical device and
that in turn compensates for lack of reasonable OS read ahead.  On a
raid array, depending on the vendor, there may be next to no firmware
initiated read ahead and that can drastically reduce read performance on
sequential reads.

A regression, yes.  In the qlogic-fc driver?  I doubt it.  Performance
tuning is what I think this basically boils down to.
But, I could be wrong.  Give it a try and see what happens.  In the 2.4
kernels I would tell you to tweak /proc/sys/vm/{min,max}-readahead,
don't know if those two knobs still exist in 2.6 and if they have the
same effect.  Andrew?
