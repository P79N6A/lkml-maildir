I agree -- I wasn't trying to indicate what one should or should not
do. Just tried to provide some insight into the intent behind the
interfaces. They were never meant to be precise, per se -- simply
guaranteeing the request would be satisfied, with no upper bound. I
agree that if timing really is that critical then delays or more
accurate timing specifications would be appropriate (one reason to use
msecs_to_jiffies() and co. rather than jiffies directly in drivers,
perhaps).
Thanks,
Nish
