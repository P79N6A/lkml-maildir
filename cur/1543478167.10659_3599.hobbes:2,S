	Linus, it may mean that we'll need two kinds of locking. There
*are* situations when we are changing the content of the buffer and want
some atomicity. BTW, writing to the locked buffer makes no sense if we are
reading into said buffer - you don't know if the read request will not
overwrite your changes a tick later. Methink we may need four bits:
premission to read, write, do IO and modify state. Yes, current mechanics
is too coarse, but ignoring eveything except IO will not be nice.
