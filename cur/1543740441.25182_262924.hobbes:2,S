Building the kernel reports this when building modules:
*** Warning: "suid_dumpable" [security/commoncap.ko] undefined!
The capability module fails then to load because it depends on  
commoncap. As a consequence bind cannot be run with the -u option to  
switch its user.
Looking at the ac patch I can see that it has changed "0" to  
"suid_dumpable" but the module obviously lacks the definition.
