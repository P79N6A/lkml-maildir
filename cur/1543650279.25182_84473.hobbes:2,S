I knew it, I already sent you the links before :)

I do agree Randy about comments, don't get me wrong. But you know what my
job condition is :) Looking at the kernel source though, you find
something like :
	/* add the fd to the interest set */
	do_add_fd_to_the_interest_set();
and then you have the code that really would need comments completely
naked. While, again, I do agree that comments are completely missing in
the patch, I'm not that kind of guy that would like a function like :
static struct epitem *ep_find_nl(struct eventpoll *ep, int fd)
{
    struct epitem *dpi = NULL;
    struct list_head *lsthead, *lnk;
    lsthead = &ep->hash[fd & ep->hmask];
    list_for_each(lnk, lsthead) {
        dpi = list_entry(lnk, struct epitem, llink);
        if (dpi->pfd.fd == fd) break;
        dpi = NULL;
    }
    DNPRINTK(3, (KERN_INFO "[%p] eventpoll: ep_find(%d) -> %p\n", current, fd, dpi));
    return dpi;
}
commented with "search an fd inside the hash". What a comment like that
adds to this code ?
