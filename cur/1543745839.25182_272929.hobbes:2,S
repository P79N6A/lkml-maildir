Well, hdparm does work for CD drives (hdparm -E), but not for CD/DVD 
combo drives...
And also, the tools I was thinking of isn't called setspeed...it's called 
setcd, and it uses ioctl(fd, CDROM_SELECT_SPEED, speed) which doesn't 
work on DVD players apparently. The same goes for the other tools I've 
tested ("hdparm -E" and "eject -x").

Which also uses the above mentioned ioctl...
