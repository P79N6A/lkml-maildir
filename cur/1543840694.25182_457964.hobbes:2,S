Well not really.  The thinking goes "gee, we need to lock against CPU
hotplug.  THe CPU hotplug guys gave us lock_cpu_hotplug() so we're supposed
to use that somethere".  We see the result.

Me too.  But fixing this will require a long look.  What per-cpu resources
are being used?  How should they be locked?  Implement.

I think we're agreeing...  cpufreq locking is busted, needs to be redone
and, I would suggest, fancifying lock_cpu_hotplug() isn't the way to do it.
