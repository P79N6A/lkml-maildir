I have a guess.  We had a similar issue with some flash chips w/IDE
emulation.  The problem for us turned out to be that the IDE emulation
reported the flash as being removable when it was not.
The piece of code is in drivers/block/ide.c:
        /* check for removable disks (eg. SYQUEST), ignore 'WD' drives */
        if (id->config & (1<<7)) {      /* removable disk ? */
                if (id->model[0] != 'W' || id->model[1] != 'D')
                        drive->removable = 1;
        }
What model/make does your flash report from hdparm -i?
