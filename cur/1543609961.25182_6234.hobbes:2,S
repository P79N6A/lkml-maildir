Yes, it _would_ be nice to clean this up, but it is a lot of work.  You
could check out Anton's patch (posted today) for this as a starting point.

It is already done, please don't duplicate.  Search for 64 bit block
devices around June of this year for a URL to Jens'/Ben's patch.  Please
repost the URL, as several people have asked.

FYI, ext2/ext3 _should_ be OK up to 8TB (possibly 16TB depending on sign
issues) filesystem, with individual files at 2TB, when using a 4kB block
size.  However, there appear to be other issues like VFS and page cache
which may have problems at this point as well.
