Yes, it does fix it. I still get quite a lot of
"Debug: sleeping function called from illegal context" and
"bad: scheduling while atomic!" while booting, but after booting
it looks stable (well, only 8 minutes of uptime). You probably
know about those already so I'll not bore you with the
bootup log messages.
I'm now running 2.5.41-mm1 + the above patch + the raid0 patch +
the mremap fix (CONFIG_HIGHPTE -> CONFIG_HIGHMEM) on our news
peering server.
It's looking better swap-wise than 2.5.40 - it's only 116K
into swap, looks like stuff that should remain in memory
is staying there.
I'll let you know if tonights expire finishes in 15 minutes
instead of 15 hours ...
Mike.
