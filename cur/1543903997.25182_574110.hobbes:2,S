The clobber which you remove with this patch.

Hmm... yeah it looks like they could be reordered. I think?

Of course, because then the compiler can't assume anything about
the contents of memory after the operation.
   #define barrier() __asm__ __volatile__("": : :"memory")
A memory clobber is equivalent to a compiler barrier.
