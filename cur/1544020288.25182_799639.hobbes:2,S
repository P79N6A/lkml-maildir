The current version isn't able to detect the end of a define, single
line or multi-line .. I think it only see's a semi-colon as a block
ending, or "}".
so if you had,
#define block_one (1)
#define block_two (2)
... [100 more single line defines] ...
int i = block_one + block_two;
The processing starts at "block_one" and that block ends at "int i =
block_one + block_two;" , since that's the only line with a semi-colon.
Then the processing moves to the next line "block_two" and that block
also ends at "int i = block_one + block_two;" , and that happens 100
times for each define moving down.
However, each define should really be seen as a block of only one line,
or when there's a multi-line define that should all be one block.
