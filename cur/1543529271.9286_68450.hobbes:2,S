A guess. If you are having the kernel send messages, i.e., you are
going through printk(), and the messages are streaming, you are
running into the fact that printk() has a fixed-length buffer and
just truncates anything that can't fit.
This is more-or-less necessary because printk() was designed to
print "panic" and such even after memory allocation failed....
