nwfs can be used for this. ncpfs is for connecting to the live server,
and you apparently do not have live server, if I understand it correctly.

What's wrong with installing NetWare and accessing data through netware? 
I think that it is simplest way to go. 
If netware cannot mount the disk, then nwfs will not mount
it too. Besides that nwfs is unmaintained - or at least I do not know
where updated code lives.
