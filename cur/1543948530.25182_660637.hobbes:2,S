Yes, please don't ever do that.  At the very best it's an eyesore.
At the worst it's a typical Richard Stallman misfeature.  And pity the
poor programmer who happens to submit a patch containing such

the error.  (Andrew sustains an incoming patch load 2 orders of
magnitude higher than I ever had to and it drove me crazy, by all
means cater to his wishes).
