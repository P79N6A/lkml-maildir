Hi guys,
Just wondering what the proper way to export a symbol that is defined in
assembly? Or is there some kind of annotation I can add in comment form
that will let checkpatch know the variable is not in C?
Here's what I'm getting:
./scripts/checkpatch.pl patches/`quilt top`
WARNING: EXPORT_SYMBOL(foo); should immediately follow its
function/variable
#197: FILE: lib/tracing/mcount.c:42:
+EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(mcount);
total: 0 errors, 1 warnings, 316 lines checked
Your patch has style problems, please review.  If any of these errors
are false positives report them to the maintainer, see
CHECKPATCH in MAINTAINERS.
Thanks,
-- Steve
