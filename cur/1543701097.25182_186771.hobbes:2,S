LVM1 snapshotting in the plain 2.4.18 kernel is known to have bugs.
You should upgrade to the latest LVM 1.0.8 kernel code. Well, I can't
access the Sistina website at the moment. I'm sure you can find a
lvm_1.0.8.tar.gz (or lvm_1.0.7.tar.gz which also has most bugs fixed)
somewhere.
In the directory LVM/1.0.8/kernel are some files:
Copy lvm.h to /usr/src/linux/include/linux and the rest to
/usr/src/linux/drivers/md (overwrite the old ones) and recompile the
kernel.
Or you can upgrade to the 2.4.23 kernel, I think it contains the LVM
1.0.7 code.
