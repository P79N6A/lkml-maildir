Hi,
I had also done a pnp patch for the smsc-ircc2 and irport 3 months ago.
Unfortunaly I don't remember where I put the patches, certainly on the 
laptop that it is in my parent home.

It will reenable the device.

Yes that's the problem this pnp, if the probe failed it disable the 
device resource.
When I do my patch I encounter the problem : I called pnp driver after 
smsc_ircc_look_for_chips, so all the resources where already reserved, 
and the pnp probe failed and it disable the resource, and the device 
found with the traditional smsc_ircc_look_for_chips doesn't work.
So in my patch if I register pnp devices, I don't run 
smsc_ircc_look_for_chips like it is done for (ircc_fir>0)&&(ircc_sir>0) 
case.

pnp should call automatiquely pnp_activate_dev() before probing the 
driver, so the resource should be activated. Have you got an example 
where the resource wheren't activated ?
