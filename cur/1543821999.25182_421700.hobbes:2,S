This much easier to solve in the player software:
do {
	ret = read(fd, buffer, size)
	if (ret > 0) {
		playbuffer(buffer, ret)
	} else if (ret < 0) {
		switch(errno) {
		case EIO:
			playbuffer(allzeroesbuffer, size);
			/* skip over this frame because of disk problems */
			lseek(fd, size, SEEK_CUR);
			/* TODO: Handle return or lseek() here */
		}
	}
} while(ret != 0)

The (somewhat) portable ioctl() FIBMAP would suffice. 
That way you find out what blocks are this file is mapped to,
and could add some of these blocks to the badblock list of e2fsck.
