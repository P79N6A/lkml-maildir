Well, those Atmel cores cover two different architectures: ARM and
AVR32. But yeah, "architecture independent" is perhaps a bit of a
stretch ;-)

Ok, attachments are a lot better than corrupted patches.

Ok, makes sense.

Hmm. Lindent does such things? That's not very helpful...

I think it went in via Andrew Morton.
But it's fine by me -- it all worked out automatically when I applied it
to 2.6.23 and rebased.

Hmm, ok. Andrew, could you elaborate on why you want it to be inline?

I understand that.

Originally, there's a TAB between '*' and First/Finally. The patch
replaces it with spaces.
That said, it's probably better to just replace the tab with a single
space...

Understandably. However, I think we should just kill that code
altogether and check BRGR instead. If BRGR is 0, the baud rate
generator doesn't run, so we can assume the port hasn't been
initialized.
I'll cook up a separate patch for that. Until then, I think we should
just leave it as it was.

I think I do. We want to check if the port is already enabled, but we
can't read it from CR. So I think we should use BRGR instead.

No extra brackets are needed. Comments don't count.

Right. Looks like the DMA patch call these functions from irq context
too...I guess it'll need the same treatment?

Ok, but both originate from the interrupt handler...

Ok, I see. But...

This means that the buffer ends up at 16K. Since the buffer itself is
kept in a struct along with a few other pieces of data, we end up
kmalloc()ing 32KB of memory...

I'm a bit tempted to just go ahead and do the changes we agree on and
post the result. Then I'll see if I can make the DMA stuff behave. I've
got a different driver lying around which is DMA-only and has a few
problems on its own. Integrating the good bits into the atmel_serial
driver will hopefully result in something that is better than either of
them.
Also, I think the DMA patch needs to be more integrated with your
"interrupt handler splitup" patch. No point in keeping two RX buffers
around, and the DMA code needs to obey the same rules as the rest of
the driver if it's going to work in -rt.
And I'd really like to have working DMA support on avr32 before
christmas ;-)
