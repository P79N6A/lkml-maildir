Under US Law, "trading on someone's goodwill" usually means using their 
trademarks or in some way using their "market association" for your own benefit.
The actual tort usually brought is a claim of "conversion" meaning that
in some way you have "converted" their business opportunities for your
own uses.  Patent infringement claims could succeed with a conversion 
tort if they can show a court you converted business opportunities
that would have otherwise been theirs.  
When you hear this term "trading on goodwill" this is usually the context
it refers to.  Conversion claims are very difficult to defend because
in the case of conversion, the tortorious party does not have to have
acted in bad faith (bad faith means you knew you were doing something wrong 
at the time, and did it anyway).  You could be the CEO of a company,
and one of your employees brought in some pirated code or something,
and you could still be liable uder the law if the other side can show
conversion occurred as the result of trade secrets being taken, or 
trademark or patent infringement, etc.
If you ever get nailed for acting in bad faith regarding a conversion
claim, the opposing side can get treble punitive damages (meaning the
judge could hit you for three times their damages amounts as a punitive 
measure).
Hope this explains this term to you.
