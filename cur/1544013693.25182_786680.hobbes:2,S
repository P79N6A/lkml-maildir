i did it via the ugly printk and captured it via netconsole
for the box with rcutree you can find the log here:
http://www.cccmz.de/~snakebyte/200.log
The interesting part seems start at 155.858923, thats when I load
the rcutorture module
with 
http://www.cccmz.de/~snakebyte/200_1.log
 i had another try,
actually saw a rcu_do_batch: rcu_head=d1907720, func=(null) in the traces,
box went into unresponsive mode afterwards
And just in case it helps somehow: 
http://www.cccmz.de/~snakebyte/200_3.log
for the one with rcupreemt you can find the log here:
http://www.cccmz.de/~snakebyte/201.log
rcutorture is loaded at 87.312399
