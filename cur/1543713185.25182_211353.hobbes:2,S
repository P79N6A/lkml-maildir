Sorry to be boring, Andrea, but 2.6.5-rc3-aa2 is now out, and you
have still not fixed the vma merging issue: I don't believe you can.
I realize you're very busy doing lots else, but you seem oddly
unaware that anon_vma is broken in this plausible scenario -
you've traded some common cases of anon vma merging for an
admirable solution to the mremap move shared anon issue;
but the latter is much too rare to justify that trade.
If I'm wrong, please show us all.  Take out the "*ptr = pageno++;"
below and, yes, I'm sure it's just a trivial matter of adding a
little code to mprotect.c and removing the #if VMA_MERGING_FIXUPs;
but actually writing data into the pages before protecting them
readonly (a reasonable thing to do) spoils it all - each page
gets its own vma with its own anon_vma preventing merge.
Whole mail from before repeated.  Yes, I read your reply: thank
you for giving us anon vma merging in 2.4.10 (so it's important?);
but checking Red Hat 2.4.9 variants (merge_anon_vmas) shows they
also needed it: so I don't think you can now take back what you gave.
