Happens all the time here too (ppc32), and did so for ages, with 2.4
(didn't specifically notice it with 2.5 yet, but I rarely use galeon
when testing 2.5 ;)
Typically happens with any kind of intense disk activity slowing down
galeon's launch process. (Not only bk, but also for example updatedb
running in the background).
I'm currently running galeon 1.2.6 (happened with all earlier versions
at least).
