I do not get your meaning.  By "block" I meant wait for some external
event (like another process or machine).  As in, the kind of behavior
which can result in deadlock if two things "block" while trying to
talk to each other.

I know what AF_UNIX sockets are.  I am talking about semantics, not
implementation.  Sure, memcpy() doesn't drop packets, but whatever is
listening to the other side of the connection might be slow or
non-responsive.  I would expect SOCK_DGRAM to drop packets in this
case.
Perhaps this expectation is wrong, but I don't think it is idiotic.
And I am genuinely curious to know what other Unixes do.
