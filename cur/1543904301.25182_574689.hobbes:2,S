That's ... weird. Most (all?) communication between any two parties
would follow a protocol where someone recv's stuff, does something
with it, and sends it back ... what would you send "right now" if you
didn't receive anything?

I really think you should -- you clearly should. From the above, it does
appear that you're mixing in multiple kinds of stuff into a single thread,
and thus mucking up the entire design (and implementation).

Ok, that's a reasonable goal.

Hmm, probably I don't understand what you're doing, how you're doing etc.
Will wait for the design & implementation docs.
