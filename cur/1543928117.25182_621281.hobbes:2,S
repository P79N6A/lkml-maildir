yeah. And even assuming for the sake of argument, that there was only 
one dominant architecture we care about, even there many of our existing 
syscall APIs are _already_ special-purpose APIs that do not encode 
parameters in a 'flat' way.
So it's not like sys_indirect() would break some magic pristine state of 
a flat parameter space - on the contrary, most of the nontrivial 
syscalls take pointers to structures or pointers to streams of 
information. The parameter count histogram i believe further underlines 
this point:
  #args   #syscalls
  -----------------
      0       22
      1       51
      2       83
      3       85
      4       40
      5       23
      6        8
the natural 'center' of function call parameter counts is around 1-4 
parameters, and that is natural. (most operators that the human brain 
prefers to operate with are like that - having higher complexity than 
that often defeats the purpose of getting an API used by ... humans.)
(side-note: in that sense, introducing some generic "arbitrary number of 
parameters" ABI design that was suggested instead of sys_indirect() 
would be _counter productive_ from a meta-design POV: it would not 
punish sucky, over-complicated APIs that expose way too many details in 
their main API call.)
