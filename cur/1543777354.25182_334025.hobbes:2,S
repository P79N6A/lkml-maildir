Subject: [RFC][PATCH] don't bind to PCI express links [8/9]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/14/34

This patch prevents the PCI<->PCI bridge driver from binding to PCI
express devices.  This is needed to coexist with the PCI express root
port driver.  Eventually we may want to rework and better integrate
linux PCI express link support, but for now this should work.
