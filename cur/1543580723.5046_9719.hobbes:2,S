Oh I can see why Hans wants to cut down his bug reporting load. I can also
say from experience it wont work. If you put #error in then everyone will
mail him and complain it doesnt build, if you put #warning in nobody will
read it and if you dont put anything in you get the odd bug report anyway.
Basically you can't win and unfortunately a shrink wrap forcing the user
to read the README file for the kernel violates the GPL ..
Jaded, me ?
