I do daily builds of the VTK CVS tree (The Visualization Toolkit, 
www.kitware.com/vtk.html, a huge 3D app).
~33 MB C++ source
It took ~1 hour on my K7 550, 256 MB, IBM DTL-307030, glibc-2.2 and 
gcc-2.95.2 ( 19991024 (release)) under most of the 2.4-test kernels (all with 
ReiserFS) for a whole rebuild.
Now it take nearly 1 and a half hour with 2.4.2-ac20.
BTW My mouse (PS2) is very sluggished during C++ compilations, now.
I am open for all of your patches. Or should I better say most :-)))
Cheers,
	Dieter
