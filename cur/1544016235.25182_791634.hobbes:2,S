Which does not work. Even besides documenation issue, which really means

It is exactly the purpose of the patch: to kill what is requested to be
killed.
I wonder how do you expect users to guess via libastral that even
adjusted score does not work, since it happens that task is so special,
that it can not be killed :)

My knowledge about cpusets is somewhat between zero and void, even more
I opened mm/kill.c the first time when created a patch (oom-killer is
not that interesting actually, but it is a matter of taste of course).
I can create exactly the reverse situation when task is supposed to be
killed, but because of the cpuset/group/whatever else you pointed above,
its score will be decreased and rogue task will continue to live :)
This game can be played by both, but let's leave that for others.
The purpose of the patch is to create an ability to kill what is
needed by the user. Exactly what user wants. User can kill the system by
millions of ways, and we allow him to do so, but we do not really allow
him what to kill when system breaks into oom condition. With my patch it
is possible. And it is exactly what is expected by the user who does not
know anything else except the names of the applications he starts.
And please let's not start again with oom_adj if arguments are still the
same: it does not work in the case I showed.
Piece? :)
Please provide a way to fix the problem I described without my patch,
and everything will be immediately resolved :)
