fyi, the thread has been damn useful for me.  If Ingo hadn't spotted that
preempt_count() imbalance then there's a decent chance that I'd have been
the first to hit it.
Time to bisect 1,000 patches: maybe an hour, if I choose the x86 tree as
the first pivot point, which is likely.
Or I wouldn't have hit it, in which case a tester hits it, and someone
(guess who) gets to enter into an intercontinental head-scratching session
trying to work out who broke it this time, consuming the tester's time too.
Plus we have a wrecked -mm and other people's code doesn't get as
well-tested as it might.
All for one silly little mistake.
So.  More care, please.
