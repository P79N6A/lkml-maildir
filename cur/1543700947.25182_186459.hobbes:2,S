No problem.
There are two pointer controllers on the T40p: a stick and a pad.
With 2.6.0, just compiling in synaptics support and running gpm as
"gpm -t ps2 -m /dev/psaux" or XFree with
  Option          "Protocol"      "PS/2"
  Option          "Device"        "/dev/psaux"
gives perfect results, both controllers work, even with
all the (3 + 2) buttons.
With 2.6.0-mm1 (the same .config of course), however, the stick does nothing.

Yes.

I believe so.

psmouse_noext=1				no change
psmouse_proto=bare			no change

psmouse_proto=imps			no change
psmouse_proto=exps			no change

Hmmm, let's see.
