	IANAL, but I believe you have the absolute right to reverse engineer and
modify it. All of that engineering and modification would be to/from a file
that was placed under the GPL, and the GPL contains no restrictions against
reverse engineering or modification. It specifically prohibits the
imposition of any addional restrictions upon those who receive the file as
far as how they can use, modify, and distribute it.
	There might be a question if the reverse engineering exceeds the scope of
the file itself. For example, if you reverse engineer the hardware that the
firmware runs on or if the firmware runs on a custom processor and you have
to reverse engineer the processor itself. But I certainly think you can
reverse engineer the contents of the firmware file (disassemble it) and make
modified versions of that firmware with absolute impunity.
