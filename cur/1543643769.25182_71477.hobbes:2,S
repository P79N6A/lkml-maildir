I want to file a patent on using hard disks as footballs.  I claim prior art, because I kicked a, (non-functional), disk across a room in front of the person who owned it, (with their permission), about five years ago, and they would verify that.
So, how do I go about filing a patent request in the EU, Japan, and the U.S.A.?
Incidently unlimited permission is granted to use disks containing only GNU/Linux software as footballs without royalties.  All other usage of disks as footballs will be considered on a per case basis.
Note that this only applies to hard disks, (IDE and SCSI), *NOT* floppy disks, or optical media.
John.
