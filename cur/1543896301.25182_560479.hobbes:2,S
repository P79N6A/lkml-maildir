And then the user who uses such features in ways not permitted by the
copyright holders are committing a crime.  They can be prosecuted by
the copyright holders and convicted of the crime.
That TiVo can somehow become liable for this just shows how broken the
legal system in the US is.  It's like making a knife manufacturer
liable for a killing using a knife they made, just because the knife
didn't have technical measures intended to prevent the knife from
being used to kill people.
