Hi Experts,
We are not able to use LVM (lvm-1.0.3-9) in kernels 2.4.18-3(RH 7.3) and
2.4.18-14(RH 8.0).We executed the following steps to create a volume group.
pvcreate /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2
vgcreate test_vg /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2
vgscan
After executing a vgscan it gave the following kernel BUG.
kernel BUG at block_dev.c:382!
EIP is at bdput [kernel] 0x1b (2.4.18-14)
The same procedure when executed on kernels 2.4.7-10(Red hat 7.2) and
2.4.9-e.3(Red Hat Advaned Server 2.1) does not give a kernel BUG.
What could be the possible reason and what is the likely solution?
Thanks and Regards
Chandrasekhar
