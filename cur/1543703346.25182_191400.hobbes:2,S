Imagine tests needed to check that hw is stable at
each supported frequency. At that point I understand
they only support 6 of them...

That would be nice. Both notebooks that I have do have broken
PST's... Ouch.

Well, you can try it, if it dies, remembed "bad combination"
else compile kernel, if it works, it probably is usable
combination... at least thats how I did it by hand on
k7 notebook.
