Just a question: does the same driver run on SunOS 4.x and Solaris
(versions 2.0 through 7 and soon 8)?  Or has Sun at some points said
"you must change the driver to match a new interface"?
For a commercial product, you shouldn't be using x.<odd>.x kernels.  You
can keep using 2.2 (or even 2.0 - there are still a lot of 2.0 kernels
in production use) kernels for a while after 2.4 comes out, and then
upgrade your driver to use the new interface.
