adsm has a buffer overflow:
"2.1.131" or "2.2.13" or any <= 7 char string as version number is ok.
"2.1.131a" or "2.1.131aa" or "2.1.131-preX" or whatever kernel with
8 or more chars will crash the server.
so, if you used some -pre kernel version, this should be it.
edit Makefile and remove the extraversion.
