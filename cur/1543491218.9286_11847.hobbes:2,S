	Ok...  So far so good...  That is a normal reconnect sequence and
that "SIGUSR1" is the smbmount daemon waking up to reconnect after a
connection failure.  Tell it to continue at this point and the connection
should be re-established and back to normal.  Maybe this is a deeper problem
that is occuring after a couple of reconnects?  I'm interested in the case
where the connection fails and you DON'T get a SIGUSR1 (you'll have to tell
it to continue after each SIGUSR1 to keep going).
	If it is a deeper reconnect problem, this gives me a hint on how
I might reproduce it.  I'll have to tinker with one of my NT boxes to
get it to periodically drop connections and see if I can kill that daemon.

	You'll probably get the same results.  At this point, the evidence
is pointing in a different direction.
	This is getting curiouser and curiouser...  /;-/
