Speedstep support is one way right now. We tell the CPU "switch to this mode"
and it does. What we don't know how to do in cpufreq is detect when someone pulls
the power out, or plugs back in. BIOS SMM magick happens, and it all
gets taken care of transparently without us having a clue that anything
happened.
We *could* hook into the APM 'power source changed' notifiers, (and I
guess ACPI has something similar somewhere). That should take care of things.

Of all the implementations I've played with (longhaul/powernow/speedstep-smi)
speedstep is the only one that does funky shit with SMM. The others are quite
dumb (and friendly) in comparison. (Ie, nothing happens on power source change)
