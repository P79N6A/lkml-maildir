I don't know how to fix that - pc8736x_gpio_init() doesn't call
pc8736x_init_shadow().
Plus the patch you sent still has spaces all over the place where we should
have tabs.  You can fix that by editing the diff, search for "^+   ".
So I'll drop this patch altogether.  Which is probably for the best at this
stage, because we're expecting a pile of teeny fixes from you agaisnt the
other 19 patches as a result of review comments (yes?)
Once all that has landed we can look at the sysfs-GPIO interface.
