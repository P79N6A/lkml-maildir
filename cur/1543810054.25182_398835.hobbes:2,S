Warn in the documentation that data may be lost if there are some filesystems
mounted from USB devices before suspend.
[Thanks to Alan Stern for providing the answer to the question in the Q:-A: part.]

+Q: Is this true that if I have a mounted filesystem on a USB device and
+I suspend to disk, I can lose data unless the filesystem has been mounted
+with "sync"?
+
+A: That's right.  It depends on your hardware, and it could be true even for
+suspend-to-RAM.  In fact, even with "-o sync" you can lose data if your
+programs have information in buffers they haven't written out to disk.
+
+If you're lucky, your hardware will support low-power modes for USB
+controllers while the system is asleep.  Lots of hardware doesn't,
+however.  Shutting off the power to a USB controller is equivalent to 
+unplugging all the attached devices.
+
+Remember that it's always a bad idea to unplug a disk drive containing a
+mounted filesystem.  With USB that's true even when your system is asleep!
+The safest thing is to unmount all USB-based filesystems before suspending 
+and remount them after resuming.
