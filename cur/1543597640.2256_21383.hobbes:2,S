As I understand it, the problem is not what to do when the system is out 
of memory.  The problem is deciding what actually consititutes out of 
memory.  IOW, if I have a 32 MB system with 512MB of swap, I could have 
200MB of swap free and still have a system so far gone that it swaps more 
than it works.  OTOH, I could have 400MB worth of idle daemons and other 
residents taking up swap with a perfectly usable system in RAM.
It would be nice if we could sack a few tasks in swap for awhile so stuff 
in RAM could get things done.  Something like "if a page gets swapped out, 
it'll stay there for at least a minute" should work fine in normal 
conditions (since the page has probably been idle for awhile, anyway).  
Under memory pressure, the scheduler would pass by any tasks waiting on a 
page that was just swapped out.
Now that I've shown off how little I know about the current OOM design, 
I'll go sit and be quiet...
