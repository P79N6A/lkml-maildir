In fact, since you call the Windows API by linking against Windows
libraries (kernel32.dll etc), Microsoft have as much right to dictate the
licensing of Windows apps as the FSF has to require apps linked against
GPLed code to be GPLed. (IMO, neither has any such right; of course, given
the spate of recent laws we've seen, I wouldn't put any faith in a legal
system to reach the "right" decision...)
In this particular case - just communicating with GPLed code - the answer
is no, you are not required to impose GPL restrictions on your users, you
can use a free license instead (or a proprietary one, if you really
want...)
