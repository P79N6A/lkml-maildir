When I did the tests I used a variant of following simple script [1].
There you can see that I only used a src port range. In an original 
paper I wrote for my company (announced here [2]) I did create rules 
that only matched IP addresses, the results were bad enough ;).
Meanwhile I should revise the paper as quite a few things have been 
addressed since then: For example the performance issues with OpenBSD 
packet filtering have mostly been squashed. I didn't continue on that 
matter because I fell severely ill last autumn and first had to take 
care of that.
