I think it is a good clue.  However the intention of the mechanism is
that only processes that change the video mode on a VT are supposed to
use it.  So I really don't think gpm is the culprit.  However it easily could
be something else that has similar characteristics.
I just realized we do have proof that schedule_work is actually working
because SAK works, and we can't sanely do SAK from interrupt context
so we call schedule work.
