Below is the patch I already sent on 28 Dec 2007 that stuffs it into 
Kconfig.instrumentation.
Technically it shouldn't make any difference whether this patch or
Mathieu's patch that stuffs it into arch/arm/Kconfig gets applied, but 
one of them should be applied for 2.6.24 (plus either mine or Mathieu's 
fix for the blackfin HARDWARE_PM support broken by the same commit).
I found the bugs in Mathieu's commit 09cadedbdc01f1a4bea1f427d4fb4642eaa19da9,
I wrote patches that restore the status quo, Cc'ed all people even
remotely related to this issue, and I opened the Bugzilla bugs required
for getting them on the regression lists. Mathieu wants the regressions
he introduced fixed different from what my patches did and that's not a
problem for me (his patches are also OK).
What went wrong that his regression fixes did not land in Linus' tree?

This patch restores the ARMv6 OProfile support that was killed by
commit 09cadedbdc01f1a4bea1f427d4fb4642eaa19da9.
