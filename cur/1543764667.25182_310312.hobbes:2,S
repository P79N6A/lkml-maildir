This patch is not going to work; local is a bash:ism too, hence this
will fail when /bin/sh is a more strict POSIX-shell.  However,
it is quite likely that the use of local is merely due to the
(totally correct) instinct of always limiting the scope of variables.
Most scripts that I've POSIX-fixed so far could just have the local
removed with no bad effects.

Using $(...) instead of `...` helps readability quite a lot for
things like this...
