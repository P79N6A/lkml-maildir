Hi.
I have read in the Doug Ledford www page that the drivers for the aic7xxx
card are going to a more or less unmantained state, 'cause he has not the time.
And also recommends to use the Justin Gibbs's ones from FreeBSD. They
are now at version 6.1.1, no more beta.
Are there any plans of switching the drivers ? I have tried to patch 2.4.1-acX,
but there are rejected hunks and had no time to patch manually and make a
diff.
