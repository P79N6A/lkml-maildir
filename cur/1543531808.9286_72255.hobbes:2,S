   I overlooked that when I updated the message queue code: you could
   kill the computer by sending lots of 0-byte messages to a SysV
   message queue :-/
Also, as another example, send the following packet sequence to a BSD
tcp stack:
	last byte in window
	last 2 bytes in window
	last 3 bytes in window
	last 4 bytes in window
For a long time (I don't know if it is fixed now) you could use this
to make the kernel allocate "rcvbuf factorial" bytes of space per
socket on a BSD machine.  (It's not a very useful remote DoS because
you have to create a real connection and thus give away your identity
to perform the attack)
I know at least FreeBSD fixed the Unix fd passing leak, so they
probably fixed this particular TCP nasty as well.
Later,
