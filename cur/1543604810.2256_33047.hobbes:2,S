   I don't control the remote machine, but it's linux (don't know which
   version). I tried with both HTTP (Apache 1.3.9) and FTP. I doubt it's
   the application. :-)
Well, the version of the kernel is pretty important.
Setting PSH all the time does sound like a possibly familiar bug.
Franks a lot,
