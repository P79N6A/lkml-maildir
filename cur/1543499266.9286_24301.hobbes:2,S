The latter - yes, the former - hell, NO. That would be incompatible with
the helluva lot of systems, Linux 2.0 and 2.2 included. If adding a traing
slash enforces symlink expansion - so be it, but making mkdir() always
follow links... No, thanks. Besides, if you are thinking about lstat() -
think of associated races.
