hdlc_fr (PVC device) uses dev->priv for N:1 mappings (a single pvc
structure may be referenced as dev->priv by multiple (up to 2
currently) PVC devs).

hdlc_ppp obviously has to do some tricks to use syncppp:
static int ppp_open(struct net_device *dev)
{
        hdlc_device *hdlc = dev_to_hdlc(dev);
        void *old_ioctl;
        int result;
        dev->priv = &state(hdlc)->syncppp_ptr;
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        state(hdlc)->syncppp_ptr = &state(hdlc)->pppdev;
        state(hdlc)->pppdev.dev = dev;
        old_ioctl = dev->do_ioctl;
        state(hdlc)->old_change_mtu = dev->change_mtu;
        sppp_attach(&state(hdlc)->pppdev);
Perhaps I should remove that and make a sane interface in syncppp.
