This is mixing two sets of requirements.
rt_run_flush() runs periodically in order to regenerate the hash
function secret key.  Now, for that specific case it might actually be
possible to rehash instead of flush, but the locking is a little bit
tricky :-)  And also, I think we're regenerating the secret key
just a little bit too often, I think we'd get enough security
with a less frequent regeneration.
I'll look into this and your other ideas later today hopefully.
