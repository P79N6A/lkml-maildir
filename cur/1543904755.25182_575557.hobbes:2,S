     agp: don't lock pages
     AGP should not need to lock pages. They are not protecting any race
     because there is no lock_page calls, only SetPageLocked.
     This is causing hangs with d00806b183152af6d24f46f0c33f14162ca1262a.

     Fix "use after free" / "double free" bug in ati_create_gatt_pages / ati_free_gatt_pages
     Hi,
     Coverity spotted a "use after free" bug in
     drivers/char/agp/ati-agp.c::ati_create_gatt_pages().
     The same one that was in
       drivers/char/agp/amd-k7-agp.c::amd_create_gatt_pages()
     The problem is this:
            If "entry = kzalloc(sizeof(struct ati_page_map), GFP_KERNEL);"
     fails, then there's a loop in the function to free all entries
     allocated so far and break out of the allocation loop. That in itself
     is pretty sane, but then the (now freed) 'tables' is assigned to
     ati_generic_private.gatt_pages and 'retval' is set to -ENOMEM which
     causes ati_free_gatt_pages(); to be called at the end of the function.
     The problem with this is that ati_free_gatt_pages() will then loop
     'ati_generic_private.num_tables' times and try to free each entry in
     tables[] - this is bad since tables has already been freed and
     furthermore it will call kfree(tables) at the end - a double free.
     This patch removes the freeing loop in ati_create_gatt_pages() and
     instead relies entirely on the call to ati_free_gatt_pages() to free
     everything we allocated in case of an error. It also sets
     ati_generic_private.num_tables to the actual number of entries
     allocated instead of just using the value passed in from the caller -
     this ensures that ati_free_gatt_pages() will only attempt to free
     stuff that was actually allocated.
     Note: I'm in no way intimate with this code and I have no way to
     actually test this patch (besides compile test it), so while I've
     tried to be careful in reading the code and make sure the patch
     does the right thing an ACK from someone who actually knows the
     code in-depth would be very much appreciated.
