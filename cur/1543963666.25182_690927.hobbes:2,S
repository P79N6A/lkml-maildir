It is indeed not.

The "smbus" in these function names are more about "what SMBus
controllers usually can do" than about the SMBus specification. But I
admit you couldn't guess.

This was an option when the functions where introduced 9 years ago.
But now that it was done, renaming them would cause even more
confusion, I think. I would be fine with adding comments in i2c-core.c
or improving Documentation/i2c/smbus-protocol to make it more obious,
though.
On a related note, you will notice that the other i2c_smbus_* functions
do not follow the naming of SMBus transactions. Again that's something
I regret but I feel that changing the names now would cause a lot of
confusion amongst developers, so I'm not doing it.

Just one patch should be enough, if I agree with all the changes. You
might make a separate patch with the things I may not agree with, so
that you don't have to cherry-revert them if I indeed don't agree, and
we just merge them if I do agree.

My bad, for some reason I thought that dev_printk() included the device
name but it in fact includes the driver name. I was wrong, just ignore
me.
