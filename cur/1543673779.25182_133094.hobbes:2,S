It may or may not be. It depends on which order it gets registered in, 
which is arbitrary (*). One can enable DEBUG in drivers/base/power.c and 
crank up the console log level to see the order that devices get shutdown 
in on their system.

(*) - Ok, we can control the registration via link order, but that's 
something we'll be tweaking until our dying days in absence of a good 
solution.
