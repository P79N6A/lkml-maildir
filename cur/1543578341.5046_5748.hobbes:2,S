I don't know of any exploitable bugs that were found in it, but the identd
server included in Red Hat 6.1 (pidentd 3.0.10) unintentionally ran as
root instead of nobody because its programmer used pthreads and assumed
that setuid() would affect all threads.
I pointed this out to the author and Red Hat, and it was fixed in
pidentd 3.0.11 and Red Hat 6.2.
