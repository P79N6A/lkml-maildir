This set of code alone allows for creation of classes which include
per-class resource accounting (including delay accounting), basic
task management for memory, CPU and disk IO, limited socket & listener
queue management for networking, and the related rules based infrastructure.
So, in short, it is a useful set of code to work with to demonstrate
real utility with CKRM.  However, this submission is not as full featured
as is being used by those on the ckrm-tech list, such as the PlanetLab
work.  There are also things in SLES9 that are more featureful than
this set although those will be worked into here in time.
It does not have the full memory management and scheduler support that
other versions do and I'm not yet convinced that those are ready to
submit.  Future enhancements will start with the cleanups as recommended
by lkml so far (thanks all ;-) followed by more work on the scheduler
and memory management side in the short term.  There are also ways
to hook in additional resource controllers for any exhaustible resource,
e.g. file handles. setrlimit style resources, etc.
Most of the next level of changes will build on these and are based
on work currently in progress on the ckrm-tech list.  However, this is
a stripped down set of code which is believed to be stable (tested on
IA32, x86-64, PPC64) with a variety of config options using both
standard regression suites (e.g. LTP, kernbench, the ckrm tests, etc.).
