Because the file just lists versions you need.  It doesn't say "since
version x.y.z you need a newer version".
Why not make it easy on people and have a log something like:
2.4.0-testX-preY
	Requires modutils-x.y.z otherwise you get error messages like
	"blah blah blah"
	Note you should no longer frobnicate the thingummie or bad
	things will happen.
2.3.whatever_it_was
	You need to mount shm on blah.
Now when you tell them to read this file it sticks and *next time* they
look there too.
Why?
Because it's a hell of a lot easier to work out what has changed from
one version to the next.
It also means that people who ran earlier pre versions of 2.4 but didn't
upgrade in the mean time for one reason or another can find out what has
changed between the few versions of this file.
Stuff like the shm stuff and the modutils stuff has generated a fair bit
of traffic.  Having a step by step Changelog style file would help
people get it right the first time.
Comments?
