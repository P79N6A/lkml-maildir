Subject: [PATCH 2.6.12-rc5-mm2] [sched] add allowed CPUs check into find_idlest_group()

Hello,
following patch adds check for allowed CPUs into
sched.c:find_idlest_group() -as told in comment line that had
removed-. But, I have several questions about that comment.
Firstly, I've understood it as "Check whether process p is allowed to
run on each CPU of to-be-found idlest group"; is that right?
If so, isn't it more appropriate to do check in find_idlest_cpu()?
Because, we're only interested in CPUs that are in idlest group
but doing a check in find_idlest_group() also checks for CPUs
that are not in idlest group (since we're traversing all the groups
in given domain). Checking this after finding the idlest group
(in find_idlest_cpu() with ordinary call order as in
sched_balance_self()) will save us from extra overhead.
Although I've questions in my mind, I'm sending a patch following
that comment. Any explanation and comment on patch will be
appreciated.
Regards.
