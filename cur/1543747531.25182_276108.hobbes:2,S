Design by Contract is the reason for descibing the agreement between
caller/callee as an contract. Bertran Meyer added the pre-conditions and
post-conditions (kind of asserts) to his Eiffel Language, and I dont think
that that is limited to a single system, but is also valid for bondaries
like an ABI. It describes conventions like syscall numbers, too.
