Which one do you prefer? (to be honest the current one is "intuitive"
to me)

It is -- there are BUG_ONs for this in __clear_kernel_mapping

It is enforced in the callers (actually there is only a single caller -- 
the GART code ) by not calling it overlapping for the kernel itself.
Given that could be checked too, but that would be probably overkill
for an internal function.

Ok.

Hmm I can add one, but if that happens the caller is likely seriously
confused and will likely cause other problems anyways. 
I don't think it can happen for the GART code which is currently
the only caller.

Hmm true -- that will only affect relocatable kernels, but for those
it's wrong. Given that the patch was supposed to fix a case 
that only happens relocatable kernels that's quite ironic :)
Actually thinking about it again you can just drop it for now.
It is orthogonal to gbpages. I think I added it to the series
when I was planning to do kernel mapping as GB pages, but that
turned out to be a bad idea anyways.
Thanks for the review,
