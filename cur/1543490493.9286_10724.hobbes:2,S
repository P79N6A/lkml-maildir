Am I the only one to experience those keyboard crashes with a PS/2
mouse on a dual P-II-450 on an ASUS Board? Keyboard just freezes.
Forget about the mouse. No signs of the driver in /proc/interrutps or
devices.
The freeze doesn't happen when I set the PS/2 mouse function to
"Auto" (instead of "Enable") in the Bios setup. It would just sit
there after a mouse-movement and block the keyboard for a while.
Btw, talking BIOS: 2.2.3 crashes instantly on this board without MTRR
support. :-/
