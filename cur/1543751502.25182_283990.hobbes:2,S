The patch below fixes this problem.
Please let me know your comments.
Thanks
Prasanna
The address used by the kprobes handler was not correct if the application
was using LDT entries for code segment. This patch fixes the above problem by
calculating the address using base address of the current code segment.
Also this patch removes the inline prefix of kprobe_handler() .
