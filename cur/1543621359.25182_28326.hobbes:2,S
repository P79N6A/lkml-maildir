That is fine.
Given unexpected amount of similar requests, I will set up a cron job which 
will automatically check and upload new version of lk miantainers list to 
anybody interested.
Just tell me how to upload the list to your site. Preferebly in a form:
------------
Hi Denis,
you may upload your list to my site as follows:
# <upload_tool> upload lk-maintainers.txt <address>...
BTW, I tested <upload_tool> and it works (version x.y.z)
# wget lk-maintainers.txt <address>....
works too, if you need it.
