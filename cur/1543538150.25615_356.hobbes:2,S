Aestetics in the narrow sense meant here is maintanability and "it just
feels like the right way". It is purely technical...

You (and a handful others) have such requirements, 90+% of users don't
care. More than enough reason not to include something which is a cost for
_everybody_, and is bad for maintainability (which will hurt even much more
in the longer run). Mingo's patch is just a quick kludge (he admitted as
much himself).  Not much reason (except for sheer stubborness) to insist on
it, is there?
Linus (and others) have asked to find out where the bottlenecks are, and
see how to fix each one of them. If done cleanly in each case, with full
understanding of the tradeoffs and careful consideration if the costs are
justified in each case and all taken together, we'll all get a better
kernel in the end.

Less stability, more overhead for everybody, loss of maintanability?

And there will be cases where doing so hurts too much, and the latency has
to be left alone. And then there is the statement from bitter experience by
Larry McVoy that adding just a tiny overhead here won't hurt, and another
little bit over there can't do no harm, ... and one day you wake up and
have a clumsy dinosaur in your hands when you started out with a cheetah.

Totally irrelevant.

Great attitude, that one: "As long as I am safe, let everybody else pay the
price. Screw them over at leisure."
Compiler switches, compiler version, program version will hardly ever
affect the stack frame layouts. What could change is jump targets, at most.
