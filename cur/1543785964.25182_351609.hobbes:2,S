Enough with the "It works for me" arguments!!!  Seriously!!!  Yes, we  
know, it works for some people, but not for others.  There are a  
billion factors.  If you have a technical argument, technical point,  
useful detailed bug report, patch, etc to make, do so, but otherwise  
SHUT UP!!!
I'm interested in doing productive code-review so we can get the  
sucker into the kernel at some point (yes, it will almost certainly  
happen eventually), but with all the bitching and non-technical  
rhetoric going on, some of you people are really wasting a lot of our  
time when we're trying to converse usefully with Hans about code- 
related issues.  If you don't have something _productive_ to say on  
the thread, don't post!
Can we keep the Reiser4 S/N ratio at a manageable level, please?
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
