yeah, i'd agree with that. I think a 400 msecs sleep period is still 
within the range that we should define as being within the scope, but 
it's probably borderline. The ultimate threshold is the reaction time of 
humans - somewhere between 30 msecs and 1 second. Sleep periods beyond 
that are typically not expected to be 'smoothly and fairly scheduled' 
the same way as say a CPU hogs are scheduled - because you can already 
'see' the effects of the sleep - so 'smoothness' is not possible 
anymore.
