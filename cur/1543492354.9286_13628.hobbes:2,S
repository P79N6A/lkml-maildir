Hi,
I encountered a bug in 2.0.xx series of kernels, though as it seems 2.2.xx 
doesn't have this bug.
If you set up a redirecting firewall entry, you cannot bind to the port,
which was redirected, while a redirected connection is alive. e.g. if you
run transparent proxy, and redirect all non-local TCP 80 port connections to
another port (where tproxy is running), you cannot start your web server.
It was tested on a 2.0.35 kernel, but I checked out the 2.0.36 patch, and
did not seem to fix the problem.
