Subject: 2.2.0 IDE failure on Alpha Multia (UDB)

I have tried up to 2.2.0-pre5, and all cannot recognize my IDE hard
drive although it seems to work with my SCSI drive.  The IDE and
build environment is a fresh Redhat 5.2.
I get hda recognized, followed by a failure message while trying
to probe interrupt.  I get three, one for hda, and two for hdb
which doesn't exist.  Adding boot parameters to force this not to
be checked doesn't help, it still hangs at the probe for the hd
devices.
Does anyone have a .config that works with an alpha Multia (UDB),
or any suggestions as to how I should configure it?  2.0.3x works
fine on the same disk and system.
