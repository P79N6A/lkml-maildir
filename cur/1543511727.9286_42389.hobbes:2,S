I believe the Apache manual has some notes on this, in the file
misc/known_client_problems.html:
"Trailing CRLF on POSTs
This is a legacy issue. The CERN webserver required POST data to have an extra
CRLF following it. Thus many clients send an extra CRLF that is not included in
the Content-Length of the request. Apache works around this problem by eating
any empty lines which appear before a request."
