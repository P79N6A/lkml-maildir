You knew this was coming...  What's special about syscalls?  There's the 
r3 thing, but other than that...
Thanks for your help with this stuff.  As I've been slowly wrapping my 
head around it I've been continuously wishing for some kind of design 
rules document describing the various paths through the assembly code, 
along with register conventions and such.  I eventually did find the 
conventions linked off the penguinppc website, but it was not obvious 
from just reading the code or the ppc stuff in the Documentation directory.
