People around here use Alcatel/Thomson "Speedtouch" and Sagem
"Fast" USB ADSLs. Linux has open-source drivers for both.
USB seems like an advantage in this case, too - you can connect
to any machine including non-PCI small network storage servers
with non-x86 CPU.
Hopefully you have a x86-64 version of the library as well.
You may want to check video cards stories, it seems either your
device is useful and it _will_ be reverse engineered and
eventually a open-source driver will be written, or your device
isn't useful and nobody will bother.
I both cases open-source from start is a clear win.
