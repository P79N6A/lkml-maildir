While I basically agree, there is still the fact that a popular real
world programming language uses [native] threads on a regular base and
it would be nice if the Linux platform would at least support a
moderate number of threads, even if it is not too popular or even
considered stupid by the kernel developers.
In the end, the kernel should try to support the user space. And if
the user space applications want to use threads, well... :-)
No, I don't want to program the kernel in Java. But I don't want to
program my user space in C#, either.
