The packing locality is saved in each directory entry and in the 
in core inode.

No metadata in directories (there are comments in the code that say
that they plan to change that in the future, but I have my doubts
if it is really a good idea)

reiserfs does not have metadata in directories. The directories are just
like ordinary unix directories being basically a special kind of file with
points to other objects in the tree.

He can't. Unix also cannot handle changing inodes (objectids in reiserfs speak).
Oh well, not all future plans work out.

Currently 12 bytes (packing locality, object id, offset). Offset is fixed
if you just want to find a file (and implicit in NFS anyways). It is also
fixed if you want to e.g. find the .. of a directory.  So the NFS 
fh needs to store 8 byte.

Sure. Just look for (parent, directoryid, DOT_DOT_OFFSET) and read the 
full parent key from the directory entry.  It is really like Unix in
this regard.

That is what they use all the ugly "has rescheduled" flags for. The entry
also has a "recently deleted" flag that is checked (hidden). When the tree
is rebalanced inbetween they catch that with a relookup (because offset
stays a fixed position). When you insert new entries before the current
filldir offset inbetween you lose (but standard ext2 is no better in that
as far as I can see). In the 2.3 version they use generation counts for
most things, so they can more easily find out if a object changed.
As far as I can see the reiserfs readdir handles all races the ext2
readdir handles.
[Note that I'm no reiserfs hacker, that just came from my own reading
of the source. Maybe it is better you apply the patch and do some
real RTFS ;]

P.S.: The loopback device in 2.3.51 seems to be still very unstable
when accessing block devices.  I get weird hangs all the time. It 
looks like it is leaking some important inode semaphore or similar, 
because all new processes hang and then the remaining processes
start to block one after another as they try to do file system
accesses.
