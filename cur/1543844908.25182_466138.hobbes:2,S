Even though dependency on baz.h is due to implementation of one of the
helpers in bar.h on a few targets and makes no sense whatsoever for
everything else?

We _are_ stuck with it.

Which only makes dependency graph fatter...  What's the difference
between including asm/uaccess.h and linux/uaccess.h?
Basically, you pull tons of includes into linux/blah.h because it
happens to include asm/foo.h and _that_ depends on having linux/barf.h
for $WEIRD_TARGET.  And guess what?  You are back to the same cross-compiles,
since attempt to remove blah.h -> barf.h will break $WEIRD_TARGET, but
you won't notice that unless you cross-compile for it.
So all you get is a bunch of harder to explain includes between linux/*.h,
_and_ extra dependencies that make no sense whatsoever.
