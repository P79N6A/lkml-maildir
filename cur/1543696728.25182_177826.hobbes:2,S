Is the same way as 2.4.24 will be - i.e. from a -pre kernel point of
view, last -rc = final.

Yes.
The advantage is simple - the maintainer has to evaluate the same set
of patches once (no increase in work here) and the only additional thing
(s)he must do is deciding which (-pre and -rc or only -rc) kernels does
it go in.
