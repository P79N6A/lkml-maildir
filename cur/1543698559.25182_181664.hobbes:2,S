I can reproduce on raid5 with linear dm on top (using XFS). I need to
kill the slab and memory debugging, I've put some bio debugging in there
instead (the memory debugging interferes with it). It's definitely a bio
use after free case, clone_endio() ends up with a freed bio.
Program received signal SIGEMT, Emulation trap.

wbi (dev->written) has already been freed by someone else.
My puny 512MB test box cannot use your slab-debug patch :). The
atomic-checker didn't catch anything.
