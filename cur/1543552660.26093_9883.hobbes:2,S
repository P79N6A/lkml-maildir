Ok. I recompiled the kernel and modules with 2.95.2 and it still seems not
to work. This is from syslog:
__alloc_pages: 2-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 2-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 5-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 4-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 3-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 2-order allocation failed.
__alloc_pages: 5-order allocation failed.
Any ideas?
