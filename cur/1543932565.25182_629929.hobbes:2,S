Yes, I still have the patch [for long anon_vma lists--not for
excessively mapped file, yet] and I'm keeping it up to date and tested.
I do see softlockups on the anon_vma and i_mmap_locks under stress, even
with the reader/writer lock patches.  I'll be trying the workloads on
Rik's latest patches to see if they address these lockups.
