Of course. (btw, when running dbench there's usually more than one
thread to generate more I/O, usually 20/40, it depends on the parameter
but let's assume there's only one thread for the sake of this example)

The time in kernel space decreases the timeslice too, so it doesn't
matter if it runs in kernel space too long, it will still be accounted
as such 1/2 of time.

I think the issue you raise is that dbench gets a 10msec more of cpu
time and xmms starts running 10msec later than expected (because of the
scheduler latency peak worst case of 10msec).
But that doesn't matter. The scheduler isn't perfect anyways. The
resolution of the scheduler is 10msec too, so you can easily lose 10msec
anywhere else no matter of whatever scheduler latency of 10msec.
The only tasks that can get hurted by the scheduler latency are real
time tasks running with RT prio that expects to get running in less than
10msec after their wakeup, this is obviously not the xmms case that can
live fine even if it becomes running after houndred milliseconds after
its wakeup.
The point is that to avoid dropouts dbench must take say 40% of the cpu
and xmms another 40% of the cpu. Then the 10msec doesn't matter. If each
one takes 50% of cpu exactly you can run in dropouts anyways because of
scheduler imprecisions.
So again: the preemptive patch cannot make any difference, except for
the read/write copy-user paths that originally Ingo fixed ages ago in
2.2, and that I also later fixed in all -aa 2.2 and 2.4 and that are
also fixed in the lowlatency patches from Andrew (but in the
generic_file_read/write rather than in copy-user, to possible avoid some
overhead for short copy users, but the end result for an xmms user is
exactly the same).
So for whatever non real time, but where buffering is possible running
lowlatency patch from Ingo or Andrew, preemptive patch, or -aa isn''t
going to make any difference.
