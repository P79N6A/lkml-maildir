Ok, this explains swap-in of random pages.  Makes sense, but it doesn't 
explain the awful tmpfs performance degradation of consecutive read-in runs 
from swap, which should have at least stayed constant

Which means that it should be at least as fast as swap-out, even faster 
because write to disk is usually slower than read on modern disks.  But 
linux currently shows a distinct 2x slowdown for sequential swap-in wrt 
swap-out.  And to prove this point, just try suspend to disk where you can 
see sequential swap-out being reported at about twice the speed of 
sequential swap-in on resume.  Why is that?
Thanks!
