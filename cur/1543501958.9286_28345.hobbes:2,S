One thing that sort of disturbs me ist that you'd really have a whole
filesystem that you'd have to mount and umount every time. I don't know
about POSIX standards etc, but to the layman (me ;) perhaps a kind of
'extended symlink' would look easier (to use, not necessarily to
implement...)
Take two directories, say /dir1 and /dir2, create an empty 'union mount
point' (mkdir /union) and join them:
	ln -U /dir1 /dir2 /union
or perhaps with a different command:
	union /dir1 /dir2 /union
Then all acesses to /union would get redirected to /dir1, if nothing was
found there, /dir2 would be searched. Write access would go to /dir1 (or
perhaps to somewhere else, whatever). You can, for static content, do this
now with a symlinking script. But not for dynamic content.
You wouldn't have any mount/umount nightmares, wouldn't have to care about
on what physical partitions your data is to 'unimount' them, it would be a
user space issue (at least, it looks like it ;) and all users could use
this feature, even if they did not have the possibility to mount/umount
things on a machine. It would not be an admin issue.
To me, this sounds like a Good Thing. I'd like to hear what you think,
especially concerning implementation.
