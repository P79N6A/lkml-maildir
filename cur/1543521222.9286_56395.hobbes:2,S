Readability is in the eye of the beholder.  For some reason, 8 digits is the
most that I easily grep.

    No No No!
    Use %10Lx to print out long long values, don't shift and print out 2
longs.
    Yes, it's expensive and ugly and horrible, but it's debugging code that
    will be ifdeffed out in the production kernel and it's more readable
until
    then.
