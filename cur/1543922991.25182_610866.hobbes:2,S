I have no idea what exact problem you have. But if the child closes some file 
descriptor that were 'cloned' at fork() time, this only decrements a refcount, 
and definitely should not close it for the 'parent'. epoll in this regard uses 
a generic kernel service (file descriptor sharing between tasks).
I have some apps that are happily using epoll() and fork()/exec() and have no 
problem at all. I usually use O_CLOEXEC so that all close() are done at exec() 
time without having to do it in a loop. epoll continues to work as expected in 
the parent process.

at exec() (granted CLOEXEC is asserted) or exit() time, only the refcount of 
each file is decremented. Only if their refcount becomes NULL, files are then 
removed from epoll set.

Too many questions here, showing lack of understanding.

epoll definitly is not useless. It is used on major and critical apps.
You certainly missed something.
Please provide some code to illustrate one exact problem you have.
