I have testing a HP 8200e USB CDRW Driver with this version of kernel.
With the vainilla test10, after wrinting 14 MB, the cdrecotrd proccess lock, 
and I have the next messsage imn the logs:
Nov 19 22:35:34 localhost kernel: usb_control/bulk_msg: timeout
These doesn't happen with test10. But I only have success with the test10 with
1 cdrom. With Windows and Nero no problems burning cd ( I test for hardware
problems). How I can help debug these issue.
Saludos
Drizzt
