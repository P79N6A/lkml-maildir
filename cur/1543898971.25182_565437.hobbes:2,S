Doesn't that do exactly what we want, then?  If we say
T __attribute__((noderef)) *v;
, we want a noderef-pointer-to-T, not a pointer-to-noderef-T.  noderef
should modify a pointer.

No, I mean __attribute__((context(...))), which means something
different.  __context__() works as a statement statement changing the
context.  __attribute__((context(...))) works as an attribute modifying
a type to say that it requires a given context, and that
accessing/calling it changes the context.  Somewhat of an odd
distinction, but sparse currently works that way.

So, to clarify what you mean by storage-class-like: __qualifier__ would
accept all attributes that modify a *type* rather than a *declaration*.

No, see above.  __context__ works as a statement, not as a way to modify
a type.
That said, "calling this function requires this context or changes the
context" and "accessing this variable requires this context or changes
the context" may represent different types of attributes.  I don't know.
