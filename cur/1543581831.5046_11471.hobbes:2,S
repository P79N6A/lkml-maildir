    Yes. The addpart utility just uses the block-layer ioctls to dynamically
    add and/or remove partitions. What this is doing is just adjusting the
    kernel's idea of what the current partition scheme is. This has _nothing_
    to do with actually reading or writing data from the disk.
But it changes the idea of odd and even.
A partition can start on an odd sector.
