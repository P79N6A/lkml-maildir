Basically I prepared syscalls.h for x86 :
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=arch/x86/include/asm/syscalls.h;h=87803da440100d50222d86cf7a1ac9cf00ed29ca;hb=HEAD
On David's request I also prepared for other arch.
But it totally depends on arch maintainers to include or not.
Thank you,
Jaswinder Singh.
