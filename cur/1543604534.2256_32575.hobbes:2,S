Hi, sorry for intruding, but what is Roswell2?
And, I also have a Abit BP6. Do you really mean that 2.2.19+ has better 
performance?
Maybe i should go back using an older kernel to test it. On this machine I 
have 2 30GB IBM disks on the HPT controller in raid 0+1, I could try som 
benchmarking with bonnie.
