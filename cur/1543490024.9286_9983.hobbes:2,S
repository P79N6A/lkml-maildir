Greetings,
Some co-workers of mine have put together an x86-based system on which to
run Linux, which has 256MB physical memory and 512k L2 cache.  The
processor is something like an AMDK6 3XXMhz or Pentium equivalent.  To no
surprise, the system runs slower with the full 256MB than it does with
64MB, I'm guessing due to the undersized cache.  The problem is that the
mainboard is apparently only capable of 512K of L2 cache.  I am not an
expert in memory/cache-related stuff, but my guess is that there is no
performance solution other than to decrease the physical memory (or get a
new mainboard).  The kernel is 2.0.  Are there any other options?
thanks,
-bp
