I am hearing conflicting opinions on this one.
Perfmon is a fairly big patch. It is hard to take it as one. I have tried to
split it up in smaller, more manageable pieces as requested by top-level
maintainers. This process implies that I supply small patches which may not
necessarily have users just yet.

The perfmon patch includes several kernel modules which make use of
the exported entry points. The following symbols are exported:
pfm_pmu_register/pfm_pmu_unregister:
	* PMU description module registration.
	* Used to describe PMU model.
	* Used by perfmon_p4.c, perfmon_core.c, perfmon_mckinley.c, and others
pfm_fmt_register/pfm_fmt_unregister:
	* Sampling format module registration
	* Used by perfmon_dfl_smpl.c, perfmon_pebs_smpl.c
pfm_interrupt_handler:
	* PMU interrupt handler
	* Used by MIPS-specific perfmon code
pfm_pmu_conf/pfm_controls:
	* global state/control variable
All exported symbols are currently used. Why are you saying this adds bloat?
