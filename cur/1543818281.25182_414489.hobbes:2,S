Negative. ;-)
I didn't try gitk myself, but according to Nick Riviera it eats 1.6G...
Otherwise, assuming that you have at least git-1.2.5, git-whatchanged on
the whole tree should be roughly equally fast as it was before grafting,
but git-whatchanged on individual paths is _significantly_ slower.
That said, 1.3.0rc2 should already have Linus' optimization which should
fix or at least mitigate the performance hit on narrowed-down
git-whatchanged.

Right now I am having amnesia and deja-vu at the same time.  I think
I have forgotten this before.
