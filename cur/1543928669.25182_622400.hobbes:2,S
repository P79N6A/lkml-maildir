Hi,
In January 2006 I had problems with the TSC clocksource, that
were fixed by adding a blacklist: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/19/362
Recently I tested 2.6.24-rc3-git1 by commenting out the only
entry in the bad_tsc_dmi_table, and everything still worked
without it:
--- dmesg.with	2007-11-28 10:58:21.000000000 +0200
+++ dmesg.without	2007-11-28 11:08:10.000000000 +0200

So it seems that the blacklisting is not needed anymore,
as the unstability is now detected automatically.
