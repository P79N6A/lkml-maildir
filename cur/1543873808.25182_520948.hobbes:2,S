Reasonable.

True.   The "shared" zones approach would simply have the problem that it
would make sharing hard and thus reduce the effectiveness of the page cache.
The "shared" zone approach also would seem to interact in very weird ways
with real NUMA and memory hotplug or process migration.  The fact that we
actually have to care about the real memory size on the machine makes me
look at it strange.
Zones should definitely be penalized in some category for the reduction
in efficiency of the page cache.  It took us decades to learn that the
most efficient page cache was one that could resize and reallocate memory
on demand based on the current usage.  Zones and possibly anything else
with the concept of page ownership seems to be trying to be ignoring
that wisdom.

Looking at your page, and I'm too lazy to figure out how to update it
I have a couple of comments.
- Why do limits have to apply to the unmapped page cache?
- Could you mention proper multi process RSS limits.
  (I.e.  we count the number of pages each group of processes have mapped
   and limit that).
  It is the same basic idea as partial page ownership, but instead of
  page ownership you just count how many pages each group is using and
  strictly limit that.  There is no page owner ship or partial charges.
  The overhead is just walking the rmap list at map and unmap time to
  see if this is the first users in the container.  No additional kernel
  data structures are needed.
