NX for 32bit programs is enabled by default now. Does it 
work with noexec32=off?
If it's that then it won't work with PAE kernels on i386 and NX
capable machines neither - i just changed the default to be
the same as 32bit, but unlike 32bit all x86-64 kernels use PAE
and many of the systems have NX.
If it's not that  don't know what it could be. I actually even used a simple 
wine program with a post rc2 kernel and it worked for me.
So it isn't anything fundamental. Maybe some bad interaction
with copy protection again, but I don't remember changing ptrace
at all this time.

If noexec32=off doesn't help please do.
If noexec32 helps then it's likely a wine bug for using the wrong
protections.
