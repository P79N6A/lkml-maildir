I've got an HP 7200i CDRW connected to /dev/hdc, and a crappy
Toshiba 4x reader on /dev/hdd.  I had to use SCSI emulation in
2.0.x to burn disks, and I'm trying to do the same in 2.2.0.
In 2.0.x I used /dev/sr[01] to access my cdroms for mounting, and
it worked.  Should this be changed to scd0?  If so, this causes
many NUMEROUS initscript changes to be able to dual boot 2.0.x
and 2.2.x on the same system.
