Right, but I'm not sure O_DIRECT implies stable storage, only data sent out to the device, not
held up in the page cache (I could be wrong).
AIO is implemented for O_DIRECT according to the paper, but they observed it not having benefit.
AIO being implemented to O_SYNC would be nice for my use, as it would also eliminate the extra
alignment restrictions brought on by O_DIRECT.
