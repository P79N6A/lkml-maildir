possible but....
a) When I boot without 'acpi_skip_timer_override' and I fall back to
using ExtINT for the timer there is no drift.
b) I rebooted and set FSB spread spectrum to 1.0 and let the machine run
over night. In 10 hours of uptime I'm off -45 seconds and growing. This
is -0.125%. So clearly having spread spectrum enabled does affect the
clock.
Thanks
