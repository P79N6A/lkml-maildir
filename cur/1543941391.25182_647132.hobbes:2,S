This doesn't apply to -mm, because the ro-mounts stuff touches a lot
of the same places as this patch.  You probably need to rebase this on
top of those changes.

If a broken NFS server or FUSE filesysem keeps returning ESTALE, this
goes into an infinite loop.  How are we planning to deal with that?
And it has to be dealt with either in the VFS, or in the kernel parts
of the relevant filesystems.  We can't just say, fix the broken
servers, especially not with FUSE, where the server is totally
untrusted.
