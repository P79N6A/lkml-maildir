Yeah, I think that's OK.  The important thing at this point is to 
determine whether the two patch sets are aligned or conflicting.  It 
sounds like they're largely aligned, and so generating a delta from my 
patches to match your needs will be relatively straightforward.
I'm trying to line all this Xen stuff up for this merge window, so I'd 
prefer to revisit it in the next dev cycle.  Did you want to get 
something into this merge window?
