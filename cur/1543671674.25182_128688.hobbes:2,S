hello,
I have an Dell Inspiron Notebook that has two pointer devices build in:
a Touchpad and a Trackstick (the mini Joystick placed in the keyboard
area)
while boot work fine in kernels of the 2.4.x series the Stick does not
work with a current development kernen (2.5.68)
The device just seems not there, no mention of it in the boot messages.
I get just
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
...
Found Synaptics Touchpad rev 5.7
