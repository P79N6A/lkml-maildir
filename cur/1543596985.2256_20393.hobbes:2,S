 Instructions on how to do the dumps? Sorry, I have not been that deep
into these matters until now :-)
 Just as an experiment, I modified the 246-ac2 eepro100.c driver to
never set the devive into D2 mode. As a result, I can now ifconfig
down/up as much as I want without killing the network. So I guess it is
really PM related.
