Just as you but I think you are testing on a margin condition [when
all file structure were already allocated], just reboot and try it
again. The failed logic is also clear from the kernel code [user
happily allocates when freelist < NR_RESERVED_FILES].
Note, I tested only 2.2 but 2.4 apparently also has the same bad
logic. Maybe with 2.4 you are also just lucky because of several other
reasons [e.g. kernel tries harder to keep freelist high and you also
have the fast enough box for it, etc].

Well, about maybe 'dmesg' will work, not others for the current
default value (10). Note, the number of fd's aren't the *currently*
used one but apparently about all of them - even if they were closed
after the open - during the existence of the app [probably buffering
and maybe this changed in 2.4].

Yep, with it's current value it's just a code decoration without any
gains.
