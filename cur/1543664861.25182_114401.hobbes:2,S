	I don't mind the changes, changes are usually good. In 2.5.X,
I had to change my code to accomodate the new PCI interface, the
removal of global IRQ, the new module interface, the various USB API
changes and other changes. And actually, your work currently hasn't
had any impact on the source code I follow (yet).
	What I mind is the lack of basic testing. From your patch, the
initialisation order mixup and the other obvious bug fix I sent you,
this code had zero chances of working at all and it's obvious that
nobody bothered to check if it could work or not for at least two
kernel releases.
	Yeah, I know that I should not complain because at least the
code did compile (modulo other minor obvious fixes that are already in
Linus BK).
