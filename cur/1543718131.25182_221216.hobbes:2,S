I'm tracking the details on this down. It's rather dated and prior to my
joining Emulex. It is possible that ppc64 was the only platform on Emulex's
support matrix that was subject to the issue. If this issue applies to other
architectures as well, we will obviously need to correct this (e.g. Emulex's
support matrix doesn't matter - we must do the right things for every
architecture).

We could embed the timer into the associated object. This is mainly an
approach issue - it was just a simplistic choice to track the timers via the
hba object. Given the amount of code churn changing this would incur, I'm
inclined to ask why, other than for style and approach, must this be
changed?
As far as timer count goes... (shrug) we do manage discovery and port login
in the driver, which other driver's don't do, which adds quite a bit. We
could certainly delineate what we have and why...

Ok - so I can see just killing the structure and making it's elements
globals. But, is this all you are asking ?  The elements are just a linked
list of the per-hba structures. You aren't recommending that we make arrays
of the per-hba structures are you ?

Ok - so why is this a significant issue ?

It is a little awkward, with the only difference whether the base structure
is found in the lpfc_pci_release routine or not. Still doesn't seem a
significant issue.

Also doesn't say they need to be global. Again - what's the significant
issue ? Seems to be just a style - whether things are done on a per-instance
basis or on a global basis. As the size requirements for this pool is based
on the number of instances - per-hba pools scales with far less effort when
more adapters are present. Growing/shrinking the pool each time an instance
attaches/detaches actually makes the global pool implementation more
complex. Coding for a global vs per-hba pool is roughly identical - the only
difference being whether the data structure is anchored globally or in the
per-hba structure.  And if you've already got per-hba pool code (the pre-dma
mapped pools), making the pool global seems to just add code.
