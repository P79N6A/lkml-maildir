  Hi,
  attached patch makes add_dquot_ref() quite faster if used on a life
filesystem. It has survived some testing on my machine but there could be
some subtle races I've missed so please leave it in -mm for a while (not
that I'd think that people use quotas with -mm kernels but at least it
should go into vanilla in -rc1...). Thanks.

We restarted scan of sb->s_inodes list whenever we had to drop inode_lock in
add_dquot_ref(). This leads to overall quadratic running time and thus
add_dquot_ref() can take several minutes when called on a life filesystem.  We
fix the problem by using the fact that inode cannot be removed from s_inodes
list while we hold a reference to it and thus we can safely restart the scan if
we don't drop the reference. Here we use the fact that inodes freshly added to
s_inodes list are already guaranteed to have quotas properly initialized and
the ordering of inodes on s_inodes list does not change so we cannot skip any
inode.  Thanks goes to Nick <gentuu@gmail.com> for analyzing the problem and
testing the fix.
