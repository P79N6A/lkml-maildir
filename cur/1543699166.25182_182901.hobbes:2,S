Maybe related: via sensors stuff is very picky about order of module
loading.
It does NOT work when i2c-dev, i2c-algo-bit and rest of sensors stuff
(isa bus, via modules) are built INTO kernel.
When everything is in modules, iw works ONLY when via modules are
modprobed _before_ anything using i2c.
Loading other i2c modules (bttv, lirc or sth else) before via modules
makes sensors unusable - there is no /sys/[...]/via directory,
or this directory is empty.
