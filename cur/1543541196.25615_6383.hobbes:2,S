Subject: 2.4.0-test5 NFS kernel server with ReiserFS and 2.4.0-test4 NFS

When my 2.4.0-test5 server crashed (as described in my other email) I had the
filesystem in question mounted via NFS.  I pushed the reset button to clear
the server.  After the reboot I did the following on the NFS client (which
runs 2.4.0-test4):
rjc@lyta:/mnt/nfs$l
ls: .: Permission denied
rjc@lyta:/mnt/nfs$cd
rjc@lyta:~$cd /mnt/nfs
rjc@lyta:/mnt/nfs$l
ls: .: Permission denied
rjc@lyta:/mnt/nfs$cd ..
rjc@lyta:/mnt/nfs/..$l
ls: nfs: Permission denied

"l" is an alias for "ls -al" that I use.
So the problems here are that the NFS permissions are stuffed (it is mode 755
on the server) and that I get a ".." displayed in the path by bash.
After umounting and mounting it again everything worked as expected.  I
believe that this is a bug in 2.4.0-test4 NFS client code.  I am unable to
easily test the 2.4.0-test5 NFS client code for this issue because of the
lack of PCMCIA support.
Another thing that may be relevant, at the time I reset the server, the
client was repeatedly sending a readdir command for that directory.  Maybe
the bug occurs when trying to read a directory when the server is rebooted.
Please let me know if you need more data and I'll do more tests.
