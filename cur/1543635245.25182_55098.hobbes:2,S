Not to mention that we even stop our own cleanup thread, looking at this.

Still, we shouldn't lock everything. I could do awful lots of interesting 
things while the only thing that is being done is to remove a module. It 
doesn't make sense IMO to lock things that are completely unrelated to 
modules.
And BTW, what's so much of an overhead if we tell everyone who tries to 
mess around with a certain module that he'd better wait until we unloaded 
it? It could be done like your schedule hack, but cleaner in that respect 
that those who got nothing to do with the module can keep on running.

But as I mentioned - atomic_t is changed (e.g. to long long) -> 
module->pad blows up, because the sizeof(struct module) is different, 
depending on which part of the union we're using.
