   How should this work when the 1K mappings are spread all over memory?
   
   Maybe I'm missing something but from James description it sounds like the 
   block layer assumes that it can pass in a sglist with arbitary elements 
   and get it back remapped to continuous DMA addresses.
   
It assumes it can pass in an sglist with arbitrary "virtually
contiguous" elements and get back a continuous DMA address.
The BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDRY defines the IOMMU page size and therefore
what "virtually contiguous" means.
