It's also possible to do long-running 'experiments' using relayfs, and
never write anything at all to disk.  Here's an example prototype I
did using a Perl interpreter embedded in the user space event-reading
loop:

As in the example above, you don't necessary need to fill any
available storage.  You can also use relayfs in 'circular-buffer'
mode, which would capture a buffer full of events up the point of your
failure.  Sounds like speculative tracing to me.
