I worked around the weird two button thing by disabling cruise control.
Get logitecH-applet (
http://freshmeat.net/projects/logitech_applet
) and
run "logitech-applet -d".
It's a fairly useful app, and for other logitech mice it can put them
into 800 dpi mode, but it's not implemented for the MX1000. Anyone here
smart enough to figure something out?
