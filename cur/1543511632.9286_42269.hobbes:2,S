Wait!  Why couldn't all devices just show up dynamically?  You'd only 
see the devices that were actually on the system (at that moment).  Wait,
somebody already made this work!  Ye gods, the anarchy.
Why should a usb zip drive, parallel zip drive, or scsi zip drive be
different to access?  They all speak the same protocol.  You don't have
a different driver for a scsi disk on a buslogic controller and a scsi
disk on an adaptec controller, do you?
