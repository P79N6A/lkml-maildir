What I currently have is two cache decay variables: one is used if the
homenode is not assigned, the other otherwise. Both are sysctls too.
But it obviously only works with lazy homenode, but the state is the same.
I'm still not completely happy with it though.
Why exactly did you gave up to use the lazy homenode?

Yes, I agree.

Hmm, I should try that I guess. Where do you call it? At the end of do_fork?
I tried to hack up wake_up_forked_process() to do it, but it required
large scale changes all over the scheduler so I eventually gave up.
