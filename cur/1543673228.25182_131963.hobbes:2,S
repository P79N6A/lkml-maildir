there's one feature I'd like to see (I don't see an easy way to achieve 
it currently):
A choice with the possibility to select one or more entries, to support 
things like:
  Supported processors:
    [ ] 386
    [ ] 486
    [ ] 586
    ...
It should be possible to select more than one item but selecting zero 
items should be illegal.
