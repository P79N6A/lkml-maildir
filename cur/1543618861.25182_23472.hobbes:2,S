Subject: [patch] [sched] x86 idle thread should clear %fs, %gs

the idle thread (on SMP, all idle threads) should clear the %fs and %gs
register, we forgot to clear these registers after the boot process. This
is especially important in kernels with the previous %fs/%gs patch
applied. (The patch below is against 2.5.3-pre3.)
i've checked and it apperas that the 0.01 Linux kernel source code has the
same problem, in boot/head.s the idle task loads the 0x10 selector, and
INIT_TASK's init TSS uses the 0x17 selector for %gs and never clears it.
:-)
while it's not an issue from the correctness point of view in the 0.01
kernel either, the TSS switching microcode probably exeutes slightly
faster if %gs is 0 for both tasks.
so it appears that this lowlevel x86 performance bug(?) is more than 11
years old! :-)
