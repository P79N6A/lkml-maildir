Hi,
Jiffy based timers and timeouts can expire too soon because the timer 
interrupt accounts for lost ticks and can increment jiffies by more than 1.
Consider the following:
     unsigned long timeout = jiffies + 1;
    <--- timer interrupt here:
         jiffies += 2 (i.e., catching up one missed interrupt)
    if (time_after(jiffies, timeout))
	/* but 1 tick worth of time hasn't (necessarily) elapsed */
This was originally observed on an ARM platform[1] but the i386 timer 
interrupt appears to behave in a similar way.
Is this solution here to:
1. Not use jiffies for timers/timeouts with only a few ticks?
or
2. Have two independant "jiffies": the existing one which is used for 
the wallclock only; and one which counts the number of timer interrupts 
and will guarantee that timers don't expire prematurely?
or
3. Something else?
