Hello,
  Just a pair of quickies on 2.3.18.
file: include/asm-alpha/processor.h
add before line 118
/* Forward declaration, a strange C thing */
struct task_struct;
Solves: A compiler screaming errors and a failed file or two
file: include/asm-alpha/pgtable.h
problem: the following macro fails to compiles because of wrong number
         of arguments to ioremap
#define io_remap_page_range(start, busaddr, size, prot) \
	remap_page_range(start, virt_to_phys(__ioremap(busaddr)), size, prot)
I went and looked in the pyxis.h file and found a macro called __ioremap so II
renamed it to this and prayed.
