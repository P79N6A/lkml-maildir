Thanks, that gave a bit insight. The last message is now:
ACPI: PCI interrupt for device 0000:00:02.0 disabled
This is my graphics card:
00:02.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Intel Corporation Mobile
945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller
So it looks like the recent changes that should repair console
sudpend/resume for Intel graphics broke suspend for me.
