Since this is not actually *used* for anything but showing the fd's in 
/proc/<pid>/fd/ etc, no. In fact, an integer will wrap a *lot* less than a 
kernel data structure will be re-used, so even with the simple "wraps 
every 4G uses", you're still better off.
IOW, if the thing actually _mattered_ we should use some bitmap allocator 
or similar (eg pidmaps etc), but with something where the only reason 
really is as a visible indicator of difference for a user that happens to 
look, simple-and-stupid is better.
