To be fair to Reiserfs, many UNIX filesystems have done this on purpose,
all the way back to FFS I think.  Once free space drops below 10%, they
change their allocation scheme to favor efficiency over speed.  Probably
this behavior doesn't make sense on a 120GB disk with 11GB free.  But it
certainly does on a 300MB disk when you get down to 30 ;-)
