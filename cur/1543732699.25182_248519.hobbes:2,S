If they're saved as files, and the app has to be changed to use them
anyway, then what's the point? Just change the app to use new files
instead.

Ugh. Change for changes sake is not a good thing. There's enough real
problems in the world without inventing random features. More complexity
without gain is a Bad Thing (tm).
I'm not saying streams is bad ... just that there don't seem to have
been very many convincing (to me) arguments raised for it yet. The 
versioning stuff would be nice, IMHO, because the stuff mainly using it 
wouldn't need to be modified in many instances ... "vi /etc/configfile" 
would keep old copies for you (only the recovery tool would need to
understand it). Saving icons seems easy enough to do with "foo.icon"
as another file.
