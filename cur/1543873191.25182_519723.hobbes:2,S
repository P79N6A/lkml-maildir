tcsh, and probably csh, has a builtin 'nice' with default +4.  So
  tcsh% nice ps -l
will show a process with nice +4.  If you tell it not to use the builtin,
  tcsh% \nice ps -l
then it uses /usr/bin/nice and you get +10.  bash doesn't have a nice
builtin, so it always uses /usr/bin/nice and you get +10 by default.
