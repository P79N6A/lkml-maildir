Subject: Kernel 2.4.25 I/O Error with NFS + VFAT partition

I use NFS to share a vfat partition. I have a slight fear that vfat over
 nfs maybe only 'accidentally' worked in 2.4.24 and earlier...
In short: VFAT over NFS works in 2.4.24, does not work in 2.4.25,
 (l)stat64 syscalls fail. Tested with both 2.4.24 and 2.4.25 clients.
For example:
Works:
ls --color=no /mnt/d
Lots of Input/Output errors:
ls -lh /mnt/d
/mnt/d is mounted with mount host:/mnt/import/d /mnt/d -o hard,intr
on the client
and is exported as
/mnt/import/d 192.168.42.1(rw,async,no_root_squash)
on the server,  which has /mnt/import/d mounted with:
/dev/hdd5               /mnt/import/d           vfat
in /etc/fstab.
Local access on the server of the filesystem works ok.
With strace of ls I've seen a few syscalls which seem to fail, examples:
lstat64("/mnt/d/putty.exe", 0x805a114)  = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
stat64("/mnt/d/temp", 0x8059654)        = -1 EIO (Input/output error)
In dmesg on the client machine, I find the following:
nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 45
nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 45
<repeated many times>
Nothing in dmesg on the server machine.
Setting /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs*debug to 1 doesn't seem to put anything 
in dmesg on the server, but alot of this on the client:
NFS: lookup(//cd2)
nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 45
NFS: dentry_delete(//cd2, 0)
NFS: lookup(//cd1)
nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 45
NFS: dentry_delete(//cd1, 0)
Which doesn't look very helpful.
Setting rpc-debug to 1, and the dmesg has this:
nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 45
RPC: 23011 release request d1f63074

nfs_stat_to_errno: bad nfs status return value: 45
Using ethereal to sniff on the NFS traffic, this is what it thinks of
a "ls /mnt/d/temp" from the server:
192.168.42.1 192.168.42.2 NFS V2 LOOKUP Call, DH:0x042c008a/temp
192.168.42.2 192.168.42.1 NFS V2 LOOKUP Reply (Call in 5) Error:ERR_OPNOTSUP
Any hints on where to go from here?
