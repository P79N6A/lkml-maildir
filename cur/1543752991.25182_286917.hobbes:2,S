/usr/sbin/smbmnt ?
After I chmodded /usr/bin/smbmnt one, I got:
libsmb based programs must *NOT* be setuid root.
29612: Connection to nata failed
SMB connection failed
I do not have /usr/sbin/smbmnt

I actually tried both. The reaction is the same (may be synonims?).  As 
soon as I specify it, codepage= and iocharset= parameters are no longer 
recognized and an error message starts to appear in the 
/var/log/messages saying that "noexec" parameter is not recognized by 
smbfs (Jan  9 15:24:09 NS kernel: smbfs: Unrecognized mount option 
noexec). This is actually not a big issue as I could write a script with 
"sudo mount /my/mountpoint". And I probably can exclude this line from 
my fstab and specify the parameters in this script. This just does not 
look very user-friendly to me (ok for my single-user laptop). It appears 
that I cannot use fstab with smbfs volumes if I want international 
characters.
