The slope appears to be flattening-out the farther out to the right it 
goes.  Perhaps that is the length of time it takes to take all the 
requisite cache misses.
Some judicious use of HW perf counters might be in order via say papi or 
pfmon.  Otherwise, you could try a test where you don't delay, but do 
try to blow-out the cache(s) between recvfrom() calls.  If the delay 
there starts to match the delay as you go out to the right on the graph 
it would suggest that it is indeed cache effects.
