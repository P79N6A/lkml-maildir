Yeah, I think I do.  Basically, the problem is that on-demand attach and
reclamation update sd->s_dentry but accesses to it aren't synchronized
properly.  In the big fat patchset, first I tried to fix it by removing
sd->s_dentry completely which didn't work because of shadow nodes, so
the second try was to fix the synchronization which is in -mm now.

I see.  I thought there was different approach on fixing the problem.
I'll try to backport the synchronization fix but am afraid it can be too
risky for -stable.  If it seems too risky, I'll send a patch to disable
reclamation.
