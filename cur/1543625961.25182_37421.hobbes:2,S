Subject: shutting down alsa causes paging exception

I am using the alsa which is integrated into the 2.5.7 kernel and I am
getting unable to handle kernel paging whenever I try to shutdown the
alsa drivers.  I have it as modules and I think it can't delete the
module.  I can supply the log entries if that would help.
I am using the via8233 modules.
Any assistance would be appreciated.
