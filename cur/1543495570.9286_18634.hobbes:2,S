initrd-archive is:
Initial RAM disk archive (untar) support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD_ARCHIVE
  This allows you to use a tar.gz archive instead of those nasty
  raw images. To use this feature first create a blank raw image
  of the correct size and fs that you want. Compress it with gzip
  then pad it up to an even kB. Next combine the rawfs.gz file with
  your root tar.gz. Spec this resulting file as the initrd image
  the boot loader should load. Now spec the offset in kB from the
  first to the second file with the kernel option initrd_archive=[int].
  Confused? Good! Just use auto fs below unless you need something
  besides a minix filesystem for the initrd.
Initial RAM disk auto fs (minix) support
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD_ARCHIVE_AUTOFS_MINIX
  Specing initrd_archive=minix will have the kernel dynamically create
  a minix filesystem on /dev/ram0 at boot time. No raw image is needed
  at all. Spec a normal tar.gz file for the boot loader to load as the
  initrd root archive.
