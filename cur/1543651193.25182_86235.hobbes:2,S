It's also going to be confusing when you change permissions on
an inode and the extended attributes in one of the paths to the
inode don't change with it.
It'd be confusing as hell if I did a 'chmod go-r' on a file I
own, but have others continue reading the file because of some
extended attributes giving them the rights to do so.
Or am I misunderstanding the kinds of extended attributes you
want to have determined by pathname instead of by inode ?
It'd be nice to have an overview of exactly which permissions
and attributes are per file and which are per pathname ;)

Rik
