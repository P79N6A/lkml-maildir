It is probably filling up the SYN_RECV socket queue per listen socket 
(1024 sockets per default). You can check by looking for SYN_RECV sockets
in netstat -t. Also make sure you have syncookies off before 2.2.13 (because
they have a deadly bug). You can increase the SYN_RECV queue size with 
the /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_max_syn_backlog sysctl.

The bug is clearly in the load balancer, not in the kernel.
It should not hit any server with such a load spike, and it should
not kill that http server that quickly.
