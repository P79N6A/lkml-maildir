What I see here is that lookup_dentry() will... Oh, my. Yes, it will work,
but... Arrgh. I'ld rather change the order of tests in lookup_dentry() and
avoid checking LOOKUP_CONTINUE in the method. By the way, your version
will *not* work for foo/dir/ - it will follow the link ;-)

Linus, I see your point here, but IMO it means only one thing - that we
should stop pretending that those objects are symlinks. They are
different. Yes, we have one more type of object. Call it VFS-link,
wormhole, whatever. We are going to completely unnecessary pains to make
them look like symlinks. What for? Especially if lstat() on them may tell
you that they are directories. It would make a *lot* of sense if we would
simply admit that we have a new type here.
I'm still curious - what are you going to do with rename()? Can the
"default" file be separated from its directory?
