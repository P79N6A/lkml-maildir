That's why I wasn't very impressed by Intel's addition of it in the
first place.  It is inherently fakeable; if not in a mainstream kernel,
at least as a very trivial patch.  The only thing that can trust it is
the kernel, which doesn't currently have much use for it.
Perhaps it should be printed out during bootup and then ignored.  Now
that I think of it, it seems no more helpful than using an ethernet HW
address locally.
