What I saw in Bryces trace was the driver was not receiving interrupts
for
the first command sent after interrutps were enabled.  This was a config
page
for spi port pages.  Since this command timed out, an internal timeout
handler was called,
and we issued an internal host reset.  The host reset called each
driver,
such as mptspi, mptfc, mptsas,  callback handers.  That ended with
as pacin in mptspi, due to we assume ioc->hd to be a valid pointer.  
We don't allocate ioc->hd to well after mpt_attach, which is where the
config
page that timed out.    We could prevent the panic in mptspi, but that 
doesn't fix the problem why we are not getting interrupts.   
I have a 2.6.18 gold kernel, and that works fine with modules.  
There are no changes in mpt stack since 2.6.18 that would effect
interrupts.  
Do you know of any changes in kernel effecting interrupts?   I suspect
that
modules versus linked drivers into kernel would matter, or would it?
I've been busy with SAS issues today, and not had time to replicat this.
