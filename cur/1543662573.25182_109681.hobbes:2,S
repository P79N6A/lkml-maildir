Not complete. This will only work if you have an AGP2.0 card.
There is no code here to setup the bridge in AGP3.0 mode, or handling
what happens when it sees a x8 card.  Fully working code is present in
2.5.60-bk if you have time to backport it (hint: I don't right now)

Has no relevance to the patch. pci.ids is only used by pciutils, and
should not affect behaviour of this agp/ide patch.
Also..

Should be capitalised 'VIA'.
