Fine, but aren't you the least bit interested in seing how it is done in 
the other real-time Linux implementation?

There are no priority inversions in the case of RTAI hard-real-time processes
either. They get scheduled exactly as other real-time processes and they
can have priority even over real-time tasks within modules.
Moreover, I would like to point out that many real-time developers like
to have memory protection for their tasks. Hard-real-time in the kernel
with RTLinux isn't possible. Hard-real-time in user-space with RTAI
is.
There is no reason that what happens _now_ shouldn't have memory protection
and what happens later should.

Sure. I'm not contesting the merits of using GPL modules. True, this
is the best way to go. However, not everyone has this option and my
claim is that this is one of the facts that is putting Linux out in the
cold in front of the competition in regards to rt.
That said, I wouldn't be using RTLinux, I'd be using RTAI to implement
both the collection and visualization tasks in user-space. The separation
between what's hard-rt and what's soft-rt could then be done either on
a process basis or even separate C files within the same program.
Again, why should hard-rt tasks not use memory protection when they can?

Again, from a purely technical standpoint, there are many advantages in
having the hard-rt tasks in user-space. As for the licensing standpoint,
the issues "should" also be very clear: since the hard-rt tasks are in
user-space, then they are covered by the GPL-exclusion put in place in
the Linux kernel.
I say "should" because nothing is clear in the current situation and
this is pivotal in developers' decision to use or not to use Linux.
