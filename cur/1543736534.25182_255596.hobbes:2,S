| 0000:00:1f.3 Class 0c05: 8086:24c3 (rev 01)

| In pci_ids.h, 0x0c05 is "PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_SMBUS", and "24c3" is a
| "PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801DB_3".  So, thanks to your help, I've found the

Yes, lspci will show that also.
lspci -x -d 8086:24c3           (2443 in my case, below)
0000:00:1f.3 SMBus: Intel Corp. 82801BA/BAM SMBus (rev 05)

Vendor ID is vvvv.  Device ID is dddd.
Subsystem vendor ID is yyyy and subsystem device ID is zzzz.
All multi-byte fields are in low-high order (little endian)
(in the PCI header).
