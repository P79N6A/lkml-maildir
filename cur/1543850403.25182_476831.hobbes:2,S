Yes, but it's irrelevant.  The kernel should not dictate how ndiswrapper
or any other driver should be structured.
I think such module would be quite inelegant.  It would be a useless
layer of indirection created to compensate for a kernel bug.

I didn't even consider this trick.  I was talking about a more
reasonable split of the code loader from the bus-specific code.  Neither
did I suggest that it would be unfair to block any wrapping.  I said it
would be hard and technically infeasible.
I'm using the same e-mail address for all free software work.  I don't
represent Free Software Foundation, although I consider it a honor to
have an account with them.

I'm not a lawyer, but I think one cannot classify software as legal or
illegal.  The law governs what people do.  Running such mix may be legal
even if distribution is not.
Anyway, I don't think it's relevant to ndiswrapper.

Last time I checked, EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL was an indication that a code
using it will be considered as a work derived from Linux.  This way,
ndiswrapper, which is free software, can be considered a derived work.
NDIS drivers don't know about any Linux API, therefore they cannot use
it directly.  The purpose of ndiswrapper is not to remove limitations
from the Linux API, but to present a completely different API.
Non-free code does not contains any code derived from Linux because it
wasn't even written for Linux.
