Hi Joe :)
I'm still pulling my hair out here too ;)
I don't think smp is to blame, as I have lockups with UP too ...
I think there is something badly wrong at a low level when running any
2.4.x kernel on a Tyan mainboard, which shows up at high IO.
Where you using any IDE related stuff on your Tyan ?
Did you enable highmem ?
I just finished compiling 2.4.21 here with magic sysreq support, I hope
to get some useful data after the lockup.
After the array has been rebuilt though (sigh).
So far I see two different issues, possibly related:
- smp kernel does not boot unless given acpi=off
  Without this command line option there is an _endless_ resetting of the
  3Ware card at boot time
- lockup when copying large amount of data from disk (ide) to array
  (scsi), on the console it says that there is a time-out on a 3Ware
  command and the card needs to be reset
  The same problem was shown with a copy over the network onto the array
  (so not touching ide, except probably for swap).
There is definitely an issue with the mainboard and the kernel here.
I swapped everything (psu, 3Ware card, disks, mainboard !), to no avail.
Any help would be much appreciated.
There should be people running Linux on these boards ?
regards,
Vincent
PS: a possibility is too that the board needs ACPI built into the kernel
in order to work ?
PPS: I own a Tyan S2468 too in my webserver, though the IO there is much
more modest (no 3Ware card either), so far no problems there (knock on
wood)
