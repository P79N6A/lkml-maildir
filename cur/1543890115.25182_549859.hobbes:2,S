In comment before distribute_fair_add(), we have such text:
/*
  * A task gets added back to the runnable tasks and gets
  * a small credit for the CPU time it missed out on while
  * it slept, so fix up all other runnable task's wait_runtime
  * so that the sum stays constant (around 0).
  *
[snip]
  */
But as I observe by cat /proc/sched_debug (2.6.21.1, UP, RHEL4), I found 
the all waiting fields often are more than zero, or less than zero.
IMHO, the sum of task_struct->wait_runtime just is the denominator of 
all runnable time in some ways, is it right? if so, increasing the sum 
of wait_runtime just make scheduling decision more precise. so what's 
meaning for keeping the wait_runtime is zero-sum?
Good luck
