It may well be, however, the one call that has flags, set, is looking a 
little irregular sitting there on its own.
We're inventing an API here for which we don't have a lot of guidance from 
existing unices, correct?  It wouldn't hurt to really kick it around.  After 
all, what we settle on in Linux is likely to become the standard.
Presumably there's some existing practice at SGI, do you have a pointer to 
man pages?
