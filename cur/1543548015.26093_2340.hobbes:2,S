Points taken. Given that I withdraw the need for console support and / or
used two seperate video cards, does it make it more feasible? We do not
allow CTRL-ALT-DEL or power off from users anyway, as the machines are
also offered for external logins and x sessions to remote machines.
Ie. For us it would not be a loss to have no console access for users -
all we need is for two people to sit down at (X) logins, and for
CTRL-ALT-BKSPACE to kill THEIR x login, and return to a login prompt. We
can use any combination of USB or PS/2 or serial keyboards and mice as
required.
