Are we mis-communicating?  By "fault in the kernel address range", I
mean that the faulting address is in that range, not where the
instruction is located.
get_user faults are obviously not in the kernel address range (except
when set_fs has been used, which is rare and not a problem here).
When __get_user faults in __is_prefetch, while decoding an instruction
in kernel space, it is good for do_page_fault to take the short-cut I
suggested, skip locks, and reach the exception table fixup.  It will
turn out to be a bad address, __is_prefetch will report that it isn't
a prefetch, and carry on to bust_spinlocks(), oops etc.
When __get_user faults in __is_prefetch, while decoding a userspace
instruction, then it won't take that short-cut because the (inner)
faulting address won't be in the kernel address range.  The normal vma
lookup will take place, install a user page, and the userspace
instruction is decoded just fine.
What have I missed?
