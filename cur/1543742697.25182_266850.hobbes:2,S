Actually, the _current_ tree does actually annotate spin_trylock() (as of
just before I sent out the email). It looks like
	#define spin_trylock(lock)      __cond_lock(_spin_trylock(lock))
where __cond_lock() for sparse is
	include/linux/compiler.h:# define __cond_lock(x)        ((x) ? ({ __context__(1); 1; }) : 0)
ie we add a "+1" context marker for the success case.
NOTE! This works with sparse only because sparse does immediate constant 
folding, so if you do
	if (spin_trylock(lock)) {
		..
		spin_unlock(lock);
	}
sparse linearizes that the right way unconditionally, and even though 
there is a data-dependency, the data depenency is constant. However, if 
some code does
	success = spin_trylock(lock);
	if (success) {
		..
		spin_unlock(lock);
	}
sparse would complain about it, because sparse doesn't do any _real_ data 
flow analysis.
So sparse can follow all the obvious cases, including trylock and
"atomic_dec_and_lock()".
