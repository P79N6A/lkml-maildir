It's not necessarily that I'm not interested but more that I'm a little
reluctant to do it for the following reasons:
The unknown:
  - have never personally submitted anything to the kernel, need to find 
out 
    what the requirements are, how much documentation you need etc
  - no guarantee how long this will take and that my submission will even 
be 
    accepted.  The longer it takes the more kernel releases that will be
    released where my driver no longer works
Loss of control:
  - my ptyx driver is just one part of the product, it has a daemon part 
and
    of coarse configurators. If the driver is put in the kernel then we 
lose
    the guarantee that a customer will be using compatible versions of 
these 
    3 parts of the product.  Now they are all packaged together
Work involved: 
  - my current ptyx driver is conditionally compiled up the whazoo since 
it 
    works on 2.2.x, 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernels.  Will have to pull out the 
2.6.x
    specific code in order to submit it.
  - will have to add the driver to the kernel config as a configurable 
module
  - any required documentation explaining how the driver works and 
describing
    the API for the master side of the PTY driver ?
  - actually creating the patch and submitting it.

Given the fact that it in this day and age it is unaceptable to require 
customers to recompile their kernel in order to use a new driver I beleive
my point was lost here.  I was referring to "out of kernel tree" driver
development.
I'll explain my point another way.
As mentioned above the Linux kernel has supported "out of tree" PTY type 
TTY 
drivers all the way back to kernel 2.2.x and up to 2.6.27. To do this the 
kernel exports symbols like 
  - alloc_tty_driver(), tty_set_operations() or tty_register_driver() used 
    in TTY driver's module init functions
  - tty_hangup() used in driver close operations/methods
  - tty_insert_flip_char() or tty_flip_buffer_push() used in ioctl 
    operations/methods.
  - tty_unregister_driver() used in TTY driver module exit functions
Now in this patch it was decided to push some of the PTY specific logic 
from 
tty_init_dev() down to the PTY driver by introducing a new install method 
for
PTY drivers.  This new install method for the PTY driver needs to allocate 
the
slave's TTY and initialize it but the TTY functions required to do this 
were not
exported.
All I'm asking is for the Linux kernel to maintain it's support for "out 
of tree" 
PTY type drivers.
