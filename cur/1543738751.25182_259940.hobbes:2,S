I have been trying to build a 2.6.9-rc4. My box is an Intel P4.
Did all the configuration properly, except that i fumbled on the keyboard and
the option 'Subarchitecture Type' somehow got set to
'(SGI 320/540 Visual Workstation)'.
The build failed with an error 'Undefined reference to machine_real_restart'
It seems that , unless Subarch is PC-Compatible ( CONFIG_PC ) , 
CONFIG_X86_BIOS_REBOOT will not be set and thusly, reboot.c would not be
compiled.
( yeah, i know messing around with configs is suicidal, but.... )
Can this be fixed ?? At the very least, hide APM options #if !(CONFIG_PC) ??
