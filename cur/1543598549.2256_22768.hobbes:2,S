Yup.  Fortunately, the countermeasure is simple: Your init script
should contain something like
  dd count=16 ibs=1 if=/dev/random of=/dev/urandom
This fixes the problem.  So this is arguably a user-level issue, not
a kernel issue.

No, it's not just difficult, it is completely infeasible under
current knowledge.

No, let's not.  If the attacker has a SHA-1 exploit, then all your
SSL and IPSEC and other implementations are insecure, and they are
probably the only reason you're using /dev/random anyway.
Instead, let's assume SHA-1 is good, since it probably is, and since
you have to assume this anyway for the rest of your system.
