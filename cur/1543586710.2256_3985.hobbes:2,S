Please don't ever report any errors to linux-kernel if you are running
your machine over-clocked. All you need is to fetch ONE bad instruction
and you can evaporate ALL the data on ALL your hard disks. Think what
happens if a pointer to a structure containing the not-yet-written
to disk blocks gets adjusted to point so some spent email buffer.
