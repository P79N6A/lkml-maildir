I don't think anybody would argue against numbers, but just that there
are not many big 32-bit SMPs anymore. And if Bill Irwin didn't fix the
kmap problem back then, it would be interesting to see a system and
workload where it actually is a bottleneck.
Not that I'm against any patch to improve scalability, if it doesn't
hurt single-threaded performance ;)

Which pagecache use? file_read_actor()?
