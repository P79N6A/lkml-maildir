Subject: possible bug with vmalloc

This is to report a problem I encountered for kernel
version 2.4.20-8.  Preliminary search found no direct
pointer to this particular situation.  
System:  Dell Dimension 2400, one 2.4GHz P4, with 1GB
DDR SDRAM (2 512MB DIMM).
OS: Red Hat 9.0 with kernel version 2.4.20-8
Problem:  vmalloc failed to allocate more than 90MB.
Initial debug found the following:
VMALLOC_START=0xF8800000
VMALLOC_END  =0xFDFFE000
It leaves the range in between to about 88MB.
I wonder why VMALLOC_START is so high?
Thanks,
Charles
