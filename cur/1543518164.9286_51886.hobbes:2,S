I noticed that you could send a CDROM_LOCKDOOR ioctl to a CDROM even
though its usage count is more than 1, whereas an
ioctl(CDROM_LOCKDOOR,0) returns -EBUSY. Is there any reason to this?
BTW, I also have a (small and trivial) patch to add the CDROM_LOCKDOOR
ioctl to IDE floppies, but I do return -EBUSY on a
CDROM_LOCKDOOR. Which is the Right Way (tm)?
