It's not that simple. We also need to deal with other types of 
non-freeable pages, such as memlocked.
Someone remind me why we can't remove the memlocked pages from the LRU
again? Apart from needing a refcount of how many times they're memlocked
(or we just shove them back whenever they're unlocked, and let it fall
out again when we walk the list, but that doesn't fix the accounting
problem).
