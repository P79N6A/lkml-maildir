No, this is not ok.  It might happen to work, but it is not valid.

By saying, "you can not call kobject_get() on a object that you know is
released with kobject_del()".  If you already have a valid reference,
you can always call kobject_get().  But once you call kobject_del() that
pointer you passed should not be passed to kobject_get() as it may now
be gone.
Does that help?
