Hi there,
Been trying to get D-Link DE-600 portable parallel port adaptor 
going, on 2.4 it is detected but cannot claim the interrupt, on 
2.6.13+ it says the port is busy.
On both kernels I need to turn on ISA to make the NIC visible, 
that's easy to fix and a patch sent recently.  But I wonder what 
other traps & pitfalls to expect?
The DE-600 works under win98se in the target laptop[1] with win95 
driver, is detected (minus irq) in another box [2] with 2.4.31-hf5.
