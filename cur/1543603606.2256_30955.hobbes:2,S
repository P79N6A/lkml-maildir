That's not a linux related problem, its a hardware problem.
I have the same thing happen with a Windows 2000 box.
Whenever i plug out the keyboard while the system is running and plugging it in
again, the system reboots.
It's the only system i can reproduce the problem, all other Linux boxes
(whatever kernel is running) run stable when playing with the keyboard.
