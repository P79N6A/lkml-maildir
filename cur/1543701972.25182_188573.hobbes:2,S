Can somebody tell me (in private) what the exploit is in the first place?
The thing is, I can see the VM getting confused and creating a zero-sized 
vma, and I agree that it shouldn't do that. The fix is trivial. But I 
don't see where the claimed privilege escalation comes from. A zero-sized 
vma isn't ever going to be _useful_, since nothing will actually find it.
So yes, it creates some confusion in the VM layer, but it all seems 
benign. It's clearly a bug, but where does the security problem come in?
