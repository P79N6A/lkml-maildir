If its a big deal, we can use a generic kobject instead of the physical
device, but I don't think it is a big deal.
It is technically not a security issue, anyhow, since the kevent
requires root to read.  But I suppose most uses are going to shovel all
the events onto a user visible bus and we don't want to do arbitration
in user-space.
