You appear to have some non typical modules loaded. If they are binary
ones from people like Nvidia please see if the box is stable without
them ever being loaded.
If its only just begun happening and you didnt change these modules or
the kernel then it may well be worth checking CPU temperature in the
BIOS, the fans and/or running memtest86 to see if it is hardware.
If you've changed kernel obviously see if the old one works reliably
first
