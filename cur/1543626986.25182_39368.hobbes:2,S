Here's an oops that appeared yesterday in umount, after 81 days of uptime
and much automated smbfs mount/umount activity:
Stock kernel 2.2.20. No charset= or other weird options to smbfs.
I seem to remember having seen this once on a 2.2.19pre series kernel as
well.
Ksymoops:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000001c
current->tss.cr3 = 08f1f000, %cr3 = 08f1f000
*pde = 00000000

3 warnings issued.  Results may not be reliable.
Right before the oops, I got these lines in dmesg:
ind //email.txt failed, error=-5
smb_lookup: find //email.txt failed, error=-5
smb_retry: signal failed, error=-3
smb_lookup: find //email.txt failed, error=-5
smb_get_length: recv error = 512
smb_request: result -512, setting invalid
smb_dont_catch_keepalive: did not get valid server!
Especially the last line - happened in the same second as the oops,
according to syslog.
Note that the smb share in question is mounted, alive and well as of this
moment, I can read files on it just fine - it's just the umount of it that
oopsed.
This is a production server in heavy use, so no _too_ experimental patches
please, can't reboot it very often :-/
Any fixes handy, anyone? Can't seem to find anything that would fix this
in the 2.2.21pre changelog...
Please CC: me, I'm not on either of the linux-kernel or samba lists.
