The reason is only it's very long-standing behavior.  When this
behavior was changed before, it seems an one user was confused at

Personally I agree that "winnt" or "mixed" is proper.
However, if we want to change the default behavior, it would need to
be tested for some months, and if anyone has no objection it can
change I think.
