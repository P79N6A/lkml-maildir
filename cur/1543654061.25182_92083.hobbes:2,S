hehe :-)
I've put this in my kernels for about 2 years now. You can also reduce the
image size with -malign-jumps=0 -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 and -mcpu=i386.
I also use some other options, but don't have them at hand right now. But it
basically gives me slightly smaller kernels, which is pretty good for install
CD or diskettes.
Cheers,
Willy
