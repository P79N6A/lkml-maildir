Petr. First - I wish to express my respect (for whatever it's
worth). Once again you are fscking sharp and up the point in problem
analysis.
For what few things I know about the situation is that the SATA
people are having great problems with the mediocre physical sector size 
and they are pushing hard toward bigger sector
sizes. This may explain a bit why there is a propability why one
should be awake in this area.
Would you mind sending me hdparm -i /dev/hdx and hdparm -I /dev/hdx
for documentation purposes? The host controller chip could be the
one to blame as well.
I fear the need for jet another black list.
