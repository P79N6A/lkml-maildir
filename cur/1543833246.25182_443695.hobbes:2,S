I'd like to run a benchmark, a tool that measures responsiveness of
[simulated]  interactive  program on a loaded system.
My question is, which program (benchmark) exists for measuring
the responsiveness [of the kernel under certain load]  to interactive
usage ?

P.S. I remember ,vaguely, reading that Ingo Molnar used some tool
when tuning scheduler several years ago, but I don't know what's name
of the tool/benchmark and where it exists.
