Actually, only one if - if the fs implemented freeze properly.
Well, the use case I envision here is something like:
# freeze /my/mount/point/to/fs/to/snapshot
except oops, that wasn't mounted, and you just froze your root fs.
I was thinking more recovery from admin error, not programming error...
If we're using sysrq to work around any possible programming error, then
we have a pretty tough job to make sure that it always works, no?
