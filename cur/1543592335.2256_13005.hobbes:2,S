Hi folks,
I want to register a new Hook in the netfilter (from kernel 2.4.4)
canvas for IP. The struct
used for register is :
struct nf_hook_ops
{
        struct list_head list;
        /* User fills in from here down. */
        nf_hookfn *hook;
        int pf;
        int hooknum;
        /* Hooks are ordered in ascending priority. */
        int priority;
};
And the hook function is a nf_hookfn, which is a typedef :
typedef unsigned int nf_hookfn(unsigned int hooknum,
                               struct sk_buff **skb,
                               const struct net_device *in,
                               const struct net_device *out,
                               int (*okfn)(struct sk_buff *));
What is the parameter int (*okfn)(struct sk_buff *) which is passed to
the hook ?
Thanx for the answers !!!
