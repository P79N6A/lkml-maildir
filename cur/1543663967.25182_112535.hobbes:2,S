It crashed again last night, on the 4th track of a transfer of 26 of
Chopin's Mazurkas over 100Mbit Ethernet (3c905 card, still).

got logged this time. (Full oops? Whyever should I get that?)
My network card had been totally stable until today, and I never had any
problems before upgrading to 2.4.20 (although admittedly 2.4.20 was
problem-free too, for 30 days or so).
I'm really starting to wonder if I should revert to 2.4.19 :( with
unreproducible NFS problems on the UltraSPARC and now this... (FWIW, I
managed to get some *data* out of one of those NFS problems the other

of the directories on that filesystem, naturally; the fs is ext3)...)
