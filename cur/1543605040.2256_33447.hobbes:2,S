Hi. Do anybody know how to compile old kernel? (I need
to compile 2.0.35 verion). I make config and make dep,
when I do it I see error (during make dep). I found
this problem as bus error in mkdep binary. I tried to
take config scripts from 2.4.x kernel and it's ok but
when I tried to compile I saw many error connected
with asm statement and function type prefixes (like
__constant_memcopy). I wouldn't like to install old
gcc and old binutils. Are there ways to compile old
kernel with new dev. tools?
Regards,
