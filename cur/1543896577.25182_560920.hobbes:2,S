I didn't see anyone else add "license" where you did.  "No further
restrictions on the rights granted herein" is very powerful and
extensive, and that's how it was meant to be.

It also says that running the software is not restricted, and since
copyright law in the US doesn't regulate execution, receiving the
software does grant the recipient the right to run the software.  So
the distributor can't impose restrictions on it.
