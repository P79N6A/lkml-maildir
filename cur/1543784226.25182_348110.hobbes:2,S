Dear Sir,
Please accept my sincere apologies if my email does not meet 
your business or personal ethics. I introduce myself as Liam a staff in 
the accounts management section of a well-known bank here in the United 
Kingdom. 
One of our accounts with holding balance of £15,000,000 
(Fifteen Million British Pounds) has been dormant and last operated, 
three years ago. From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of 
this account, a Foreigner by name Gerald Stone died on the 4th of 
January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham here in UK.
Since then, 
nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money, as he 
has no family member   that has any knowledge as to the existence of 
either the account or the funds; Information from the National 
Immigration also states that he was single on entry into the UK. 
I 
have confidentially discussed this issue with some of the bank 
officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal 
with. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the 
next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you 
after due processes have been followed.
This transaction is totally 
free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not 
originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act.
On your interest, let me hear from you. 
Warm Regards,
Liam
