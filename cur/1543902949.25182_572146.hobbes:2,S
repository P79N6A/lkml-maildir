Actually, the nmi handler does use the get_cycles(), and also uses the
spinlock code:
arch/i386/kernel/nmi.c:
__kprobes int nmi_watchdog_tick(struct pt_regs * regs, unsigned reason)
...
static DEFINE_SPINLOCK(lock);   /* Serialise the printks */
spin_lock(&lock);
printk("NMI backtrace for cpu %d\n", cpu);
...
spin_unlock(&lock);
If A - we change the spinlock code non atomically it would break.
   B - printk reads the TSC to get a timestamp, it breaks:
   it calls:
printk_clock(void) -> sched_clock(); -> get_cycles_sync() on x86_64.

Yeah, that's a mess. That's why I always consider patching the code
in a way that will let the NMI handler run through it in a sane manner
_while_ the code is being patched. It implies _at least_ to do the
updates atomically with atomic aligned memory writes that keeps the site
being patched in a coherent state. Using a int3-based bypass is also
required on Intel because of the erratum regarding instruction cache.
Using these techniques, I can atomically modify the execution stream. It
would be relatively simple to re-use the framework I have done in the
Immediate Values as long as no non-relocatable instructions are
involved.

Should be checked if NMIs and MCEs are active at that moment.

Yup, as long as we are just adding/removing a f0 prefix, it's clearly
atomic.

I see the mb()/rmb()/wmb() also uses alternatives, they should be
checked for boot-time racing against NMIs and MCEs.
init/main.c:start_kernel()
parse_args() (where the nmi watchdog is enabled it seems) would probably
execute the smp-alt-boot and nmi_watchdog arguments in the order in which
they are given as kernel arguments. So I guess it could race.
the "mce" kernel argument is also parsed in parse_args(), which leads to
the same problem.

Exactly, I always make sure that the immediate value within the
instruction is aligned (so a 5 bytes movl must have an offset of +3
compared to a 4 bytes alignment).

Yes, kprobes is case 1: atomic update. And we don't even have to bother
about Intel's erratum. This one is ok. That's mainly the
alternatives/paravirt code I worry about.

Sure, something like:
Make sure this API is used only to modify code meeting these
requirements (those are the ones I remember from the top of my head):
Case 1) Inserting/removing a breakpoint
        - Do as you please. These updates are atomic and SMP correct.
          Just don't put a breakpoint in code called from the breakpoint
          handler, please.
Boot time:
Case 2) Changing 1 byte of a larger instruction at boot time, splicing
        it in 2 instructions or leaving it as 1 instruction
        - Only one CPU must be live on the system.
        - If you plan to modify code that could be executed on top of
          you (NMI handlers, MCE, SMIs), make sure you do an atomic
          update to a "legal" instruction, or else an illegal
          instruction will be executed.  Spinlocks, memory barriers and
          rdtsc are examples of code executed by such handlers. The
          other option is to force application of alternatives before
          these interrupts are enabled. Make sure that maskable
          interrupts are disabled.
Case 3) Changing 1 byte, turning 2 instructions into one at boot time
        - Follow same conditions as 2.
        - Make sure that no threads could have been preempted in the
          instructions you are modifying.
        - Study the code to make sure no jump is targeting the middle of
          your new instruction.
Case 4) Changing more than 1 byte of an instruction at boot time
        - Same as in 2-3 (depending if you leave it as one instruction
          or splice it).
        - Make sure that the bytes you are modifying are aligned and
          that you do an atomic update. It may involve playing with the
          instruction's alignment a bit.
Live:
Case 5) Changing one instruction live on SMP (ok wrt Intel's errata about
        XMC)
        - Insert a breakpoint to run a "bypass" while you play with the
          code. This bypass will single-step the original instruction
          out of line.
        - Make sure the instructions to be copied into the bypass are
          relocatable.
        - Send an IPI to each CPU so they execute a synchronizing
          instruction (sync_core()) before you remove your breakpoint.
          Else, a CPU could see two different instructions at the same
          location without ever executing the breakpoint. The
          sync_core() makes sure we don't fall into Intel's XMC errata.
        - Think about how you plan to teardown your bypass (especially
          considering preemption within the bypass)
        - Since we use a bypass, the update does not have to be atomic,
          but keep in mind that without a bypass, it would have to.
          i.e. the bypass should not be required for AMD processors
          (AFAIK).
Case 6) Changing instructions (i.e. nops into one instruction..) live on
        SMP (ok wrt Intel's errata about XMC)
        - Use the same bypass technique as in case 5.
        - Make sure that no thread can be preempted in the nops, as they
          could iret in the middle of the new instruction. (use the
          freezer)
        - Make sure that no interrupt handler could iret in the modified
          code (start a worker thread or each CPU, wait for them to
          run.)
            However, this technique is not perfect: if an interrupt
            handler returns to the code being modified, then we get
            preempted again, schedule the worker thread, come back to
            the original thread and reexecute another interrupt handler
            with an iret within the modified instructions, it could
            return in the wrong spot. Putting every thread in the
            freezer seems to overcome this problem.
        - Don't modify code of threads that cannot be put in the freezer
          (idle thread?).
        - Make sure that no hypervisor could iret in the modified code
          (that's hard).
        - Study the code to make sure no jump is targeting the middle of
          your new instruction.
