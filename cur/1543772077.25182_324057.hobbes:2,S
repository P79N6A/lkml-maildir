I am running the 2.6 kernel and I notice that every now and then my
system stops responding but is still accessible remotely through ssh.
I can not work on the console. The only way out is to reboot either
remotely or by hitting the reset button. When the system comes up
again I get the following message in my dmesg and I need to actually
reboot it once or twice before this error goes. of I get a spew of
following messages. These messages don't stop till I reboot the
machine.
