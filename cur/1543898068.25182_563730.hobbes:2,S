Lost? maybe.  Improved on, defiantly so it's loss isn't a bad thing.
The 2.4/2.5 split was, as far as I recall, a mess.  2.5 had too many 
changes to stabilize in any reasonable amount of time and 2.4 then needed 
new drivers and features to keep it from becoming obsolete.  Back porting 
drivers without the needed infrastructure resulted in instabilities in 
the 2.4 branch.
I recall one time where I needed a certain raid device working and not a 
single kernel had that driver working properly.  2.4.x oopsed in the 
driver after random intervals and the 2.5 kernel crashed in other places.
Now development is broken into smaller stages that are easier to debug and 
made stable in shorter time.  If I just need to update a kernel and don't 
need any new features and drivers I can just update to the next point 
release and I know it won't break anything.  If I want new features I can 
update to the latest stable branch or the latest pre release but either 
way my stuff is more likely to work than I did back in the 2.5 days.
I think people who keep demanding a return to the old development system 
forget how badly it sucked in the first place.
