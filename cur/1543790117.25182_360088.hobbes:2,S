Whatever became of this discussion?  It seems that the e1000 driver
in 2.6.13.2 uses rx_errors as the total of all receive errors, while
the patch John was proposing broke them out into separate counters.
It doesn't matter too much to me either way, but I'd like for there to
be a precisely documented definition for the various net-stats so that
I can correctly show the values to user-space (I can certainly add rx_discards
to rx_errors for a 'total rx errors' value, but I need to know whether
rx_discards is already in rx_errors to keep from counting things twice.)
Jeff:  Could you lay down the law somewhere in the Documentation/
directory and then let us start fixing any driver that does it differently?
Thanks,
Ben
