Listners in the kernel? Sound like a PAGG thing again!
Guillaume's stuff was originally an in-kernel module. CSA/Job
are kernel modules also. We all use hook management feature of PAGG,
which offer event notification to other kernel components.
Guillaume moved to connector approach and i am moving to that
direction too because Andrew likes to see in-kernel modules moved
to user space.
It is kind of funny to see someone trying to get a notification
through a connector and then feed it back to the kernel! This
does not sound right to me!
