You're probably mostly right, but I really don't know if I'd
start with the assumption that threads don't share anything.
I think they're very likely to share memory and cache.
Also, these additional system wide balance points don't come
for free if you attach them to common operations (as opposed
to the slow periodic balancing).
find_best_cpu needs to pull down NR_CPUs remote (and probably
hot&dirty) cachelines, which can get expensive, for an
operation that you are very likely to be better off *without*
if your threads do share any memory.
