It's clearly a good thing to be testing for this. As Alan points out,
100mA is the maximum permitted pre-configuration draw, so what a device
draws when plugged in is not informative.
However, obeying the USB power rules is not an end in itself -- the
relevant question is the minimum power the device requires to operate
correctly and without damage.
The MaxPower value does not appear to be a reliable index of this. My
USB stick has a MaxPower value of 178mA and works flawlessly off an
unpowered hub. Unfortunately devices don't seem to tell us what their
minimum power requirements are, so we need more flexibility in writing
rules for this.
udev could surely pick up on the MaxPower value and tolerate up to a
100% underrun on USB flash drives. That would likely still 90% of the
pain right there, maybe all of it.
What are the reasons not to do this? What happens if a USB stick is
underpowered to one unit? Nothing? Slower transmission? Data loss? Flash
memory destruction? If it's just speed, it's a price well worth paying.
This is a great opportunity for a small exercise in empathy, utilizing
that little long-neglected mirror neuron. Thousands of USB sticks
inexplicably go dead in people's familiar hubs on keyboards and desks;
Linux kernel coders dream sweet dreams of not violating USB power rules.
I appreciate Andrew's support for a real-worldly solution.
