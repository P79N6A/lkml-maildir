The problem with the per cpu schedule counter would be to deal with
stopped tasks that would wake up at the exact wrong moment. With a 32
bits counter, it could happen.
At 1000HZ, given the scheduler is only called once per tick
(approximation, it can also be called explicitly) it would happen after
49.7 days. But then, if the kernel calls schedule() too often, this can
be sooner than that.
Having a per-thread variable would make sure we don't have this problem.
By the way, a task cannot "really know" which CPU it is on : it could be
migrated between the cpu ID read and the moment it uses it as an array
index. Actually, knowing the schedule count would help to implement
algorithms that helps getting the cpu id and knowing it's been valid for
a period of time without pinning to a particular CPU.
