Nope :) 0.7 is not valid but this:
echo -e "+\c"; sleep 1; echo -e "+\c"; sleep 1; echo -e "+\c"; sleep 1
Didn't work either.
I think the thing here is that you can't send a clean set of +'s to
a modem on a ppp link the way a modem would want it. It'll either
get transmitted too fast or it'll be dirtied by packet headers/footers.
Also, I always thought that YOU had to send it to the modem. If it gets
it from the other end of the connection it doesn't work. I experimented
with this when I used a straight serial connection (ie not ppp or slip.
zmodem for transfers and so on). Then I had to get the timing right
and a set of +++'s coming at me did sweet fa.
