All of your givens can be tightly controlled using specific routing 
combined with a routing daemon.  Add a touch of correct firewalling and 
all is constrained just like you please.

Netfilter (iptables) is very extendable, it is certainly not limited to 
if(src=1.2.3.4) pass();  By configuring your DNS server suitably right 
off the start, you eliminate a large group of possible threats.  Email 
is simple, inbound is one port and security for that is entirely 
userland.  You don't have to be psychotic paranoid about either email or 
DNS if you apply some of the basic tenents of security; configuration, 
ownership, and permissions.  Add chroot if applicable.
Firewall rules can be very fine grained.  What's left can be dealt with 
in userland.  If it can't be handled, drop it.  In the event of 
overload, it's always better to drop packets than to pass ambiguous data.
