I already have the documentation for the chips for my robotics projects,
I even have the chips. I'll have an Airbag-equipped IBM notebook soon,
hopefully, too.
However, this is not enough at all to write the driver. The
accelerometer is a trivial analog component (ok, not so trivial, but
still just analog), and the main question is how it is connected to the
PC.
Until IBM says something about that, or somebody reverse engineers their
BIOS/Windows drivers/whatever, a driver can't be written.
