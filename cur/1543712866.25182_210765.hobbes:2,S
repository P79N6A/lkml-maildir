This patch seems to be included in 2.6.5-rc2 bk-curent but it don't
solve the same problem with xsane (or scanimage) which hangs in
ioctl(n, USBDEVFS_SETCONFIGURATION) when accessing my Epson USB Sc
anner.Not the first time I run it but each time after that.
The process remains in D state for many hours before returning for no
evident reason.Was working fine in 2.6.3.
