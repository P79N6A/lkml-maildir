Subject: Strange memory usage with Opteron/NUMA

We have several dual-Opteron/8GB RAM systems, all of which run an  
application (MySQL) which allocates a fixed block of 6.5GB of RAM,  
and looking at ps confirms this. However, when running the kernel  
(2.6.14.2) with the K8_NUMA option enabled, 2GB of swap is used (on  
top of the 6.5GB of physical memory), although the process only  
claims to be using 6.5GB in total. Additionally, the kernel is  
definitely swapping this imaginary memory in and out.
Switching the K8_NUMA option off eliminates this.
Here is an example ps line:
mysql     2395  3.5 85.1 7296648 6921696 ?   S    Nov15 101:03 /usr/ 
local/mysql/bin/mysqld --basedir=/usr/local/mysql --datad
And the associated /proc/meminfo contents:
