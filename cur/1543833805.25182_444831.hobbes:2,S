I agree with your assertions that the stuff in asm/atomic.h should be
steered away from, since they generally are not expected to work in
userspace.  In fact, if you try to use the 32-bit sparc or parisc
ones, it simply won't link because the implementations are external
and use a hash table spinlock scheme which is in the kernel image.
However, the pthread based locking is bad if you want to recover
from arbitrary signals correctly.  I ran into this problem while
trying to get Linux/Sparc Mono working well.
When people want atomic cmpxchg or atomic increment/decrement, they
want a true atomic.  This means either finish the whole thing, or
leave no trace of the atomic having started in the first place.
Spinlock based atomic implementations, which is what a lot of
platforms lacking true atomic use, absolutely cannot reasonably
provide this semantic.
