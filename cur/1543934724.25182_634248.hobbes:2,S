Yes I am.
First of all I would like to be sure that my usage of checkpatch.pl is corretc,
what I do is the following:
paolo@paolo-desktop:~/linux-2.6/kernel$ ../scripts/checkpatch.pl
--file profile.c
and then I start fixing the errors (so far I didn't start looking at
the warnings).
What I still don't understand are the following options:
 --no-tree    => run without a kernel tree
 --root       => path to the kernel tree root
Should I specify the path to the kernel tree root? If so, why?
That said, the errors reported by checkpatch.pl are now:
paolo@paolo-desktop:~/linux-2.6/kernel$ ../scripts/checkpatch.pl
--terse --file profile.c |grep ERROR
profile.c:128: ERROR: "foo * bar" should be "foo *bar"
I just forgot to fix it, very trivial. Will do in a minute.
profile.c:460: ERROR: do not use assignment in if condition (+  if
(!(entry = create_proc_entry("XXXXXXXXXXXXX", 0600, root_irq_dir))))
profile.c:594: ERROR: do not use assignment in if condition (+  if
(!(entry = create_proc_entry("XXXXXXX", S_IWUSR | S_IRUGO, NULL))))
Here I need an hint ( or an example) about how to fix these two errors :-)
After that, I'll focus on the warnings.
Thanks Ingo!
