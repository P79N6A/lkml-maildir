compiled fine, but after booting the system does not respond to the keyboard 
(I can see the message "serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1" om my 
screen)
The system also hangs after fscking my root partition (fsck completed without 
errors)
After my harddisks went to sleep I switched the system off and after booting 
the kernel (2.4.19-pre7) panics (and the caps- and scroll-lock leds are 
blinking) as it can not mount the root fs due to the following errors:
EXT2-fs error (device ide0(3,1)): ext2_check_descriptors: Block bitmap for 
group 0 not in group (block 0)!
EXT2-fs: group descriptors corrupted!
if it is needed i can send my .config after i have recovered my rootdisk.
