In fs/partitions/check.c the following ugly include exists:
#include <../drivers/base/fs/fs.h>	/* Eeeeewwwww */
It can be killed with no problem, the prototypes contained therein are
not used by check.c.
Is this preparations for furter device model changes?
If thats the case, the fs.h file, or at least the content, shall be placed
in include/linux for general access.
Here is a patch to remove the said include statement.
