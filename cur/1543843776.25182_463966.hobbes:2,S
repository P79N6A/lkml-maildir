What you basically tell me is (rephrased to make it more clear): Implement 
kprobes support or fuck off! You make it very clear, that you're unwilling 
to support static tracers even to point to make _any_ static trace support 
impossible. It's impossible to discuss this with you, because you're 
absolutely unwilling to make any concessions. What am I supposed to do 
than it's very clear to me, that you don't want to make any compromise 
anyway? You leave me _nothing_ to work with, that's the main reason I 
leave such things unanswered. AFAICT there is nothing I can do about that 
than just repeating what I told you already anyway and you'll continue to 
ignore it and I'm sick and tired of it.
bye, Roman
