By the way, I think it would be useful if there was a more
formalized frame for such unit tests, so that they could be used
in automated kernel testing.
To avoid false positives when grepping through the code, perhaps
such tests could be placed in separate files, using a different
extension, e.g. .ct for ".c test", or in some "test" directory.
(That is, in case they're distributed along with the kernel code,
which, IMHO, would help to avoid code drift.)
Just an idea ...
