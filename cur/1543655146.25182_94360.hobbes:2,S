Oops, right. I forgot the HW LBs that do triangulation. I wonder 
however, why one wants to use a HW LB and not configure it to work in 
NAT mode.

As mentioned before, you don't necessarily need to patch your kernels, 
there are other possibilities to overcome the arp problem. You could (if 
not already done so) consult the LVS howto where solutions are certainly 
applicable also to non-LVS LBs.
Regards and sorry for my wrong assumptions,
