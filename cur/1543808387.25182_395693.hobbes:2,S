Alan, can this related to LBA48 compatibility? I remember having
problems with this when Andre Hedrick added LBA48 support around
linux-2.4.19. The drive (Maxtor 4D040H2) advertised it supported LBA48,
but the chipset (Ali 1543 rev C3, IIRC) didn't.
Unfortunately I can't test it, my Ali main board died a couple of
months ago so I'm just guessing :-(.
