You can track this in your port specific code.  That's what I do on
sparc64 to deal with this case.  I record the TLB miss type (D or I
tlb), and also whether a write occurred, in a bitmask.  Then I check
this in update_mmu_cache() to decide whether to prefill.
I store it in current_thread_info() and clear it at the end of fault
processing.
Just grep for "FAULT_CODE_*" in the sparc64 code to see how this
works.
Although, I'm ambivalent as to whether prefilling helps at all.
