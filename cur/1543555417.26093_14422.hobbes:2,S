 So we might check for it.  Good!

 And suddenly certain i486 systems do not work anymore?  Well, I haven't
actually heard of an i486 SMP system running Linux so far (maybe they just
work fine, so no reports).  But we could try the following, instead:
	if (boot_cpu_id != -1U
	    && APIC_INTEGRATED(apic_version[boot_cpu_id]) && !has_apic)
		/* No SMP */
It should filter broken MP-tables and work fine on all 82489DX-based
systems.  I'll have a patch soon if we agree on this solution.
