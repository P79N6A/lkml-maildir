Ok guys - we will never come to an agreement on what would be the
sensible thing to do.
For good reasons, too: the purposes and uses of the systems out there,
and the minds of the people administering them, will be as different as
anything.
This reminds me of the "core naming wars", the "vm overcommit wars", and
other "big" (in the minds of people) issues that were solved to
everyones satisfaction with an entry in /proc.
May I suggest:
  /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
Semantics:  Numbers can be written to log_signals - these are signal
numbers that will cause a log entry to be written, when the given signal
is delivered. The file can be read, in which case it will list the
signal numbers that cause log entries to be written.
Examples:
]$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
   4
   7
]$ echo +15 > /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
]$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
   4
   7
   15
]$ echo -4 > /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
]$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
   7
   15
]$
Possible extension:
]$ echo '*' > /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
]$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
 ... lists all signals ...
]$ echo '-*' > /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
]$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/log_signals
]$
In my oppinion it does not make sense to distinguish between signals
sent from process to process, and from kernel to process.  Some garbage
collectors, for example, depend on the kernel sending the SIGSEGV and do
their own handling of that - while for many other processes that
situation indicates a problem.   Better to handle that kind of thing in
user space log auditing tools.
An implementation of the above is left as an exercise for the reader  :)
