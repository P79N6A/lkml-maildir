I try to use hotswap feature with my hddrack.
But at first, I try to use this feature with
  plugged on hdd.
I use
kernel-2.4.13 (from kernel.org)
hdparm-4.1.3
and idectl from hdparm contrib.
I unmounted all partitions on my second hdd&DVD and executed
# idectl 1  rescan
It normaly unregisters my second IDE chanel then
registers it again, found my hdd&dvd and
throws Oops in
