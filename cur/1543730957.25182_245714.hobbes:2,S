Remember that reiser4 allows you to operate on little pieces of data,
glueing and rearranging them inside files (something like that).
No other filesystem has that capability, and it's a data model which
the fancy features (when they exist) will use.
You can map those pieces to underlying directories and files and
renames and unlinks, so that the fancy stuff works on other
filesystems, but it would be a useless model because those other
filesystems wouldn't be recognisably "ordinary" files any more.
For reiser4 to expose that model through a VFS interface, and the
fancy stuff to use it through the VFS interface, and for the fancy
stuff to work (even imperfectly) on other filesystems which don't
offer those operations, some kind of fall-back "store metadata and
fragment rearrangements in auxiliary files with special names" layer
would be requied.  That's a big job.
I think it's a good job to do (funding, anyone? :), and the right
place for that (imperfect but useful) fall-back layer is userspace
with perhaps minimal VFS support.  Another reason to put the fall-back
layer in userspace is that applications which depend on the fancy
stuff can still be portable to other OSes, working, but a bit
smoother, faster and more "integrated" on reiser4.
