I bought a Terratec DMX 6fire LT card, assuming it was the same as the
DMX 6fire which, according to "linux/sound/pci/ice1712/ews.c" shall
work.
However, I can't get the system to initialize the card.
Kernel is 2.6.0-test2, same result with -test1. Haven't tried older
kernels.
"modprobe snd-ice1712" gives the following:
snd_ice17xx_ak4xxx: module license 'unspecified' taints kernel.
ALSA sound/i2c/cs8427.c:98: unable to send register 0x7f byte to CS8427
ALSA sound/i2c/cs8427.c:221: unable to find CS8427 signature (expected 0x71, read 0xfffffffb), initialization is not completed
ALSA sound/pci/ice1712/ice1712.c:390: CS8427 initialization failed
Tell me if more info is needed.
