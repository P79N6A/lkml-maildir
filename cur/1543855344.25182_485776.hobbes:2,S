Really you do not have to make it udev aware, it is enough to make it 
sysfs aware. You will be done by reading /sys/class/misc/rtc/dev on 
initialization and replacing /dev/rtcN with device with the address 
read. If you have configuration static enough, I guess you can even 
create it once and for life of current setup with current kernel.
