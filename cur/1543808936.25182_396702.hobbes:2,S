Now, I agree - it's a strange bit, and was initially just done "because we 
can and it seems to be a conceptually valid notion", so it's not used a 
lot.
That said, the semantics shouldn't be all that unexpected:
	#define VM_DONTCOPY  0x00020000		/* Do not copy this vma on fork */
and the usage ends up matching that (except for some really strange issue 
with hugepage counting, which just looks wrong, but never mind).

Well, I can't actually see any case where a driver could validly do 
something that confuses the VM enough that clearing that bit could cause 
new problems. 
Put another way: if that is true, then we have bigger issues, and should 
fix those problems instead.
So at most we might have _applications_ that depend on the fork not 
causing a copy-on-write thing (due to the old and broken private mapping 
of ioremapped areas behaviour), but if that's true, then it would have to 
be the driver itself that does the MADV_DOFORK thing, so..

I can see where Hugh is coming from, but I think it's adding cruft very 
much for a "be very careful" reason.
I would suggest that if you wanted to be very careful, you'd simply 
disallow changing - or perhaps just clearing - that DONTCOPY flag on 
special regions (ie ones that have been marked with VM_IO or VM_RESERVED).
