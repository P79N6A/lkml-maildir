Lookups don't happen in the context of a namespace.
They happen in the context of a vfsmnt.  And the switch to a new
vfsmnt is done by matching against (dentry,parent-vfsmnt) pairs.
current->namespace is only checked for mount & unmount operations, not
for path lookups.
Which means proc_root_link, when it switches to the vfsmnt at the root
of the other process, should traverse into the tree of vfsmnts which
make up the other namespace.
