Okay, there's a clean patch of slram against 2.2.1 at
http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~keryan/slram/
 
(thanks Mark Tranchant). No modules or experimental stuff, just the same
old kludge. There have been a few comments about using extra RAM above 2G
on Intel as a RAM disk, and this patch certainly won't do it, but you're
welcome to try :)
