Hi,
I used KNOPPIX on a 2 way Dell WS 530 (Xeon 2.0 GHz). This distribution has 
CONFIG_M386 set (as most others also?) and HT was not enabled. I compiled the 
kernel myself (same config as KNOPPIX but with CONFIG_MPENTIUM4) and HT gets 
enabled. So is _does_ matter for which processor the kernel is optimized.
Greetings
