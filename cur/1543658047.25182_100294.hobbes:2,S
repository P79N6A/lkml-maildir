Yes, it needs to be clarified.

I wasn't aware of that posting until Adam pointed it out.  It seems
to be a sensible and easily understandable position.

Yup.  Now is their chance.  Is everyone OK with treating the contents
of header files in the same was as EXPORT_SYMBOL()?  ie: LGPL?
Really, I don't see any alternative.  Even things like the semaphore
down() function are inlined.  Linus's 1995 intentions are infeasible
unless we also treat that part of the kernel API which is implemented
in headers as being exported.
It might make sense to be more selective, by putting #ifdef GPL around
some portions.  If anyone cares, and can be bothered.  If any inlined
function is complex enough to justify that then it's too damn big and
should be zoomed into a .c file anyway.
