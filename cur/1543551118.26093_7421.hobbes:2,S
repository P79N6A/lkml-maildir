Try the "ignore byte93" option in the IDE menu. The IBM doesn't try to
do UDMA66 because the ZIP drive kills its 80-wire cable detection
mechanism. If you ignore byte93, which is where the IBM drive tells the
system what it thinks about the cable, the system will enable UDMA66.

For fastest operation I'd suggest moving the Kenwood to hdb and the ZIP
to hdd. That way you won't need to ignore the byte93 setting. (Assuming
you really DO have the special UDMA66 80-wire cable).
