I do not use a separate queue coz, if it's single, it becomes a common
lock for all CPUs.
RT tasks are scheduled as usual and the only problem arises in
reschedule_idle() when an RT task is pushed onto the run queue when
1) on its CPU it is _not_ running the idle
2) on its CPU is running another RT task with higher priority
In that case a "good CPU" discovery loop is triggered, the task is moved
on that CPU runqueue, need_resched is set, an IPI is sent and on return
from the remote CPU IPI  path the RT task is run.
A good solution would be ( i'm not doing it now ), in setscheduler() to
move the task in a way to have an even distribution of RT tasks among
CPUs.
