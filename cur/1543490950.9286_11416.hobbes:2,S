The Mach64 server is known to read things directly from the BIOS of
the card and rely on those values ... there is _no_ way the kernel can
find out about that and the server really should ask the kernel for
this instead when running on an fb device.
Basically your X server doesn't know it is running on top of the
framebuffer ... you can call that a bug or a not yet implemented
feature ... in my book it falls into the latter category, so
complaining to someone is not justified, but feel free to implement
this in the XFree Mach64 server.
