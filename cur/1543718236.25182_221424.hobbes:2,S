Legacy mode requires effectively reserving a bit, which works in this case
since all 32 aren't used.  So inherit all caps is all valid caps (which,
btw,  still exludes CAP_SETPCAP).  Something like "=eip cap_setpcap-eip"
would inherit all valid caps.

I believe only a kernel thread could do this (and init) since they are the
only ones that could get CAP_SETPCAP.  Same threat as it is currently.

Yup you're right.  I liked how you did that in your patch and was just going
to steal that bit ;-)
