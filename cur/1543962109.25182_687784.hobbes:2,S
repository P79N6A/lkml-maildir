Somewhat.

The testing is not really a part of the process right now, though.  We somehow
hope that the kernel will be tested sufficiently before a major release, but
we don't measure the testing coverage, for example.  Of course, that will
involve more work independent of the code writing, but at one point it'll
just become a necessity.
