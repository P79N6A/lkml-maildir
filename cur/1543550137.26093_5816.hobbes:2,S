And most people would said that Linux is years ahead of OS/2 because
we thought the issue through and concluded that C++ does not belong in
the kernel.
The issue keeps coming up on this list and every single time it gets
shot down with good technical reasons. Go search through the mailing
list archives or kernel-traffic and see why.
I just wish the linux-kernel FAQ would remove the rubbish about C++
actually being superior to C in some cases it had in it last time I
looked at it.
