Yes, they were stating that clearly. IIWNOC (If I Were Not On Crack) I 
remember them saying to not assume any ordering besides the data 
dependency and the CPU self-consistency in the future CPUs, and to use 
*fence instructions when certain semantics were required.
But google did not help me in finding that doc, so maybe I were really on 
crack :)
