The ptrace fix in 2.2.3ac1 still allows less capable, but CAP_SYS_PTRACE
capability possessing processes to ptrace more capable processes. IMHO it
would be better to require that the ptracing process has equal or more
capabilities. Otherwise, CAP_SYS_PTRACE would be close to CAP_SYS_SETPCAP.
Also, looking at cap_issubset definition, there's a ! missing before
cap_issubset().
include/linux/capability.h:
#define cap_issubset(a,set)  (!(cap_t(a) & ~cap_t(set)))
[example: a=maxcap=0xff, set=cap_ptrace=1: !(ff & ~1) = !(ff & fe) = !fe = 0]
