Wouldn't it be easier to pass each commit through checkpatch and
email the committer if there is a problem?  Each commit can be viewed
as a standalone patch afterall; what does blame add?

Definitely the way to go.  I'm pretty sure the Git guys would agree to
distribute checkpatch.pl along with the existing pre-commit hook.  So
at least enabling checkpatch would be trivial for those convinced to
use it.
