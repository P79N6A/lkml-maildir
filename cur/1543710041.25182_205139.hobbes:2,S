No, the quotes are not required.  This works for me:
modprobe dummy numdummies=3
Using /etc/modprobe.conf also works, as you suggested, but without
the quotation marks:
options dummy numdummies=3
Either way shows this in /proc/net/dev:
dummy0:       0       0    0    0    0     0          0         0        0
 0    0    0    0     0       0          0
dummy1:       0       0    0    0    0     0          0         0        0
 0    0    0    0     0       0          0
dummy2:       0       0    0    0    0     0          0         0        0

HTH.
