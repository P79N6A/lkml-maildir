Bah, don't play dumb: man -S perl chop.
A quick demonstration with man version 1.5d on a work machine.
    $ pwd
    /usr/man/manperl
    $ ls
    chop.perl
    $ man -S perl chop
    ...
    chop(perl)    Perl Programmers Reference Guide   chop(perl)
    ...
More advanced versions of the man package support "subsections", so you
can type "man -e perl chop" and view the man page chop(3perl).
You don't need hyperlinked manuals. The "man" system is admittedly old
and cruddy, but well written and organised man pages make it better. I
don't think the current perlfunc(3) man page is very useful at all. It
would be far better to also have chop(perl) or chop(3perl).
