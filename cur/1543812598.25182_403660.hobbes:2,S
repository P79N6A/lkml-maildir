Well, this behavior doesn't exist in 2.4 kernels, since the kernel build
in 2.4 was very different.  Nevertheless there are plenty of 2.6 kernels
out there :-).

I am willing to postpone this change.  However, I can't say how much of
a window this delay will give you: I can say that it's extremely
unlikely that it will be another 3 years before GNU make 3.82 comes out.

I've modified the kbuild system to collect .PHONY files into a variable,
PHONY, and then used that in the if_changed* macros.
Using this method I've determined that the new version of GNU make works
exactly like the old version under various tests (build from scratch,
rebuild without any changes, rebuild with simple changes, etc.)
I've submitted a patch to linux-kernel implementing this change, with
an appropriate Signed-off-by line.
