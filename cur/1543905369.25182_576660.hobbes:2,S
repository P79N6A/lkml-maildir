have you actually caught any rcu locking problem this way? Double 
unlocks should be caught by lockdep already, at a higher level.
in any case i've added a slightly different form of this change to the 
-rt queue that will also check for counter overflows. But i'm not sure 
we want to litter the code with trivial checks like this, so i'm keeping 
it separate and if it does not trigger anything real i'll remove it.
