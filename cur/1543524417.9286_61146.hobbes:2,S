And yet more:
I started 2.3.42 without a disk in the ZIP drive (/dev/hdd). I unmounted /home 
(on /dev/hdc3). I ran dd before and after putting a disk in the drive and
mounting it:
Before
$ dd ibs=4096 obs=4096 if=/dev/hdc3 of=/dev/null
524287+0 records in
524287+0 records out
After
$ dd ibs=4096 obs=4096 if=/dev/hdc3 of=/dev/null
1547910+0 records in
1547910+0 records out
This is passing strange. Without having read the partition table on the ZIP, 
it will stop silently after something more than 2 GB, having read it it will
read the whole 6 GB.
Hope this helps.
Thanks,
	Luca
