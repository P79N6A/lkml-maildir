Linus, although these patches are fairly straightforward and
non-impacting in the !CONFIG_NUMA case, would you prefer it if a
non-NUMA person who knew the scheduler (say, me) went over these patches
and merged them with you?
Ingo, do you have an opinion either way?  I think basic NUMA support,
especially in the load balancer, should make it in before 2.6.
