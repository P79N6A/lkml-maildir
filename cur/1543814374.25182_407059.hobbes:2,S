ACPI SPEC define:
_PSV  : thermal zone object that returns Passive trip point in
	tenths of digress Kelvin.
_ACx:  thermal zone object that returns active cooling policy 
	threshold values in tenths of degrees Kelvin.
I suspect , when hang, the system was trying to start active cooling
with Fan
in function acpi_thermal_active that was somehow conflict request with
_PTS's call to SMPI in BIOS.  So, the solution is :
	Disable active/passive cooling request before suspend.
To verify this, please hack acpi_thermal_active.
We need a suspend/resume method for acpi thermal to cleanly solve 
your problem.
Thanks,
Luming
