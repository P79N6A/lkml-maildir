WHAT?
The previous value here i386 is 1000 --- so why is the default 250.
Changing the *default* time interrupt frequency in a stable series is
*really* bad idea if you ask me.
Now that this has hit mainline please consider applying:

 	 Allows the configuration of the timer frequency. It is customary
 	 to have the timer interrupt run at 1000 HZ but 100 HZ may be more
