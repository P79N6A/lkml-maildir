I'm trying to use channel bundling with ISDN. I configures the
master and slave devices. But everytime I try to add the second
link my kernel spits out the following into the syslog:
May  5 19:05:36 nexus kernel: lldata_handler unknown primitive 6
What is this? I'm using kernel 2.2.7.
Regards
Martin
