I've not seen that, but I wouldn't be entirely surprised if IO 
virtualization eventually causes something like this to happen: 
virtualizing PIO is just damn painful right now, due to the lack of any 
way to remap it.
I *think* you may be confused with the PCI config cycles, where the new 
MMIO configuration was introduced (for similar virtualization reasons). 
But it's also possible that this is one of those undocumented areas and 
CPU's actually do have some IO remapping facility.
