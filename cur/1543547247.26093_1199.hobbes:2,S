Perhaps, but it's sure not obvious:
        bh->b_blocknr = (long)mp->pbm_bn +
                (mp->pbm_offset >> inode->i_sb->s_blocksize_bits);
        bh->b_blocknr >>= block_bits;
        movl %eax,20(%esp)	; store shifted pbm_offset to temporary
        movl %edx,24(%esp)	; "
        movl 20(%esp),%eax	; load low part
        addl (%esi),%eax	; b_blocknr = pbm_bn + pbm_offset
        movl %ebp,%ecx		; load block_bits
        shrl %cl,%eax           ; b_blocknr >> block_bits
I've not got 2.95 handy, and your test case isn't executable,
so its difficult to see exactly what might be wrong here.
