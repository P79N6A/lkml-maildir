The issue is not following a moving target. It's reading poorly maintained 
and documented code. 
If I were you, I would work first at cleaning up the code, then work on 
adding features to it. There were many opportunities I found for 
improvement when reworking the code, plus it became orders of magnitude 
easier to follow.
