Actually, shouldn't the string functions be "extern inline" then?
That would mean we use the copy from lib/string.c instead of generating
a new copy for each file in which gcc decides not to inline the function.
It would also let you get rid of the IN_STRING_C hack that is needed
to avoid the clash of the "static inline" and the "extern" version.
