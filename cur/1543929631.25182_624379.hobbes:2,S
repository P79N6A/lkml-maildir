The signoffs don't make sense.
If you authored the patch then please put a From: at the top of the changelog
and include your signed-off-by:.
If Mathieu worked on or forwarded the patch then include his s-o-b.
If he wasn't in the delivery path but has tested/reviewed/approved the
patch then Acked-by: is more appropriate.  Documentation/SubmittingPatches
has details...
