I think I reported that from 2.5.3.
It is the usual virt_to_bus() residuus inside of sound/oss/dm/dmabuf.c
I also posted a wrong patch (was working, but not using the new API), but
maybe someone else posted the right one, and I did not read it.
With this residual virt_to_bus it is quite unusefull that
sound/oss/i810_audio.c and other drivers have been updated correctly.
