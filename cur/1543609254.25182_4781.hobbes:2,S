40Megabyte per second you say. Well, if it benchmarks at 1-2 Megabytes 
per second it sounds like a 2 Megabytes per second drive to me, not a 40 
Megabytes per second drive.
But, to try to speed it up, make sure you're running with DMA mode enabled.
hdparm -d1 /dev/hdx where x = number of drive (a=primary master, 
b=primary slave, c=secondary master, etc).
But, apart from that, if it indeed is a real problem, what's the name of 
the motherboard, chipset, hard drive, what linux kernel revision are you 
running and do you use any special patches or tricks with it?
