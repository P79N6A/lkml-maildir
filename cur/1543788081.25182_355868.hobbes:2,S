I am not sure that is the right thing for us to be doing actually.  We
need to abstract things our own way to create a proper abstraction
underneath sys_reiser4() and the general naming system that we are
headed towards.  That means we need the "flow" abstraction as the basis
of our code.  The flow abstraction is based on the idea that we should
be able to connect to and read or write any stream of bytes, in user or
kernel space.  A flow is a stream of bytes.  That is useful for
constructing sys_reiser4() and other semantic enhancements that we
plan.  If you would like to generalize the vfs interface such that it
reads and writes to and from flows, and user space buffers are just a
special case used by read() and write(), and it is not done page at a
time, that could be good for vfs.

what does extent enabled mean?  Do you mean that it passes more than one
page to the fs?  Or do you mean that readahead windows are set by the fs
because readahead is affected by file layout?  Or both?

Well, to start with, reiser4_write is plugin specific.  Writing to a
file might require modifying a file that it inherits its contents from,
for instance.
I think though that there is another consideration, which is that
reiser4 is not licensed just for Linux.  We need to create a coherent
body of code that can be ported to operating systems that don't have vfs
layers specially modified for us.  The easiest way to do that is to
write our own code for the key things like read and write.
VFS is supposed to allow filesystems to have their own read and write
implementations.  That is its defined interface.  You should allow us to
use it.  Other filesystems that are less ambitious might well want to
use generic code, but reiser4 is not a yellow package with black lettering.
