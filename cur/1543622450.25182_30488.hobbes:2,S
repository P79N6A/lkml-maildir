Well, the book you are talking about is the dinosaur book is it not? 
The reason they use this is for more cross platform opportunities and to
stress that operating system procedures are not a bunch of MicroSoft API
calls (as was the main downfall of the old way the class was taught with
the first edition of the dinosaur book).  Though the book is light on
implimentation it is rather useful for ideas and concepts.  This book
and their authors actually came highly recommended from this list
earlier.
Hope this helps
