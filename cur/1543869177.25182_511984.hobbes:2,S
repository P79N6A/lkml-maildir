i think the best model here is to use kevents or epoll to discover 
accept()-able or recv()-able keepalive sockets, and to do the main 
request loop via syslets/threadlets, with a 'queue back to the main 
context if we went async and if the request is done' feedback mechanism 
that keeps the size of the pool down.
