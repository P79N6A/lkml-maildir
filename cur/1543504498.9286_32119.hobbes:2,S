Yes, such cache thrashing is certainly an issue. The trick is to strike the right
balance, rather than avoid improving latencies. The decision you really want is not
"is there someone ready to run" but "is there someone ready to run, that is about
to kick off some slow I/O that could be left running while I continue this work".
Unfortunately that's not so easy to achieve.
