I disagree. It's not any easier at all.
On PC's (x86 and x86-64) we actually already set the ELCR as well as we 
can (look for "eisa_set_level_irq()"). And a driver _literally_ cannot 
change it from the system value, because of the polarity confusion.
In the other cases (IO-APIC) we usually have it level, but when we have it 
marked as an edge, there is almost always a real reason for that too (ie 
legacy interrupt, it really _is_ edge-high, not level-low).
