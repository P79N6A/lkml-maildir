The pcmcia cardbus code reads the rom to extract CIS data.  So yes, we
need to run the firmware.

pci=rom only assigns address space, it does not activate it.  The
RBEM56G rom address was being assigned but reading the rom got 0xff.

In that case we need a PCI routine to explictly activate the expansion
rom so pcmcia can read it, and another routine to explicitly disable it
afterwards.
