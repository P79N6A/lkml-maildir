Or cpufreq

I haven't seen this bug on previous (2006-08-08) mm snapshot. Here are new i2c patches
apple-motion-sensor-driver-kconfig-fix.patch
kill-include-linux-configh.patch - it's my patch, I'm testing it for tree days.

Aug 14 22:30:10 ltg01-fedora kernel:  <6>note: thunderbird-bin[2288] exited with preempt_count 1
Is it possible that this is a problem with net stack?
Binary search will take ages - I don't know how to reproduce this bug.
