I really fail to see how handling POLLHUP and POLLERR would be a problem, 
even for fds where you specified a 0 event mask. If you receive them, you 
remove the fd from the set, and you flag the associated data structure for 
a lazy removal at the end of the current event loop. Where is the problem 
here?
