VERITAS doesn't own any copyright of the microcode driver because I wrote 
it _before_ I joined VERITAS.

I agree, so I should have included in the patch the change to 
MODULE_AUTHOR (in both microcode and bfs).
Or maybe MODULE_AUTHOR shouldn't contain the email address, if the module 
is mentioned in the MAINTAINERS which does contain it? Why repeat the data 
and so have to remember to maintain it?
Kind regards
Tigran
