I'd err on the side of caution about extending this principle.  The
device driver layer's issue for DMA transfers seems to cover the device <->
kernel cache consistency, not the device <-> user space or kernel <->
user space cache consistency.
The kernel <-> user space consistency issue seems to be one for the MM
layer to deal with.  There are other situations where this view can go
out of sync - for instance, when you have a page of a file mmap'd, and
you use sys_write() to that page of file.  This is the issue which
flush_dcache_page() seems to be addressing, and it's the same issue
with PIO from IDE.
So no, I don't think it is a device driver issue at all.
