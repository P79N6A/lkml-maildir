Subject: [PATCH] SELinux: make mmap hint addresses greater than mmap_min_addr
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/28/100

The new protection to keep users from writing to the first couple of
pages of virtual memory also is stopping mmap operations which are only
giving a hint address greater than 0 but less than mmap_min_addr.  This
patch should take the address given to mmap and move it up to
mmap_min_addr thus eliminating the security denial.

Testing on this patch resulted in expected results.  With my
mmap_min_addr set to 40960
About to MAP_FIXED addr:40960
Works.
About to MAP_FIXED addr:32768
mmap: Permission denied
So MAP_FXIED operations were getting denied.
About to mmap with hint addr:40960
Works.
About to mmap with hint addr:32768
Requested addr:32768 but got addr:40960
So given a low hint address we just got 40960
About to mmap with hint addr:4096
Requested addr:4096 but got addr:40960
About to mmap with hint addr:8192
Requested addr:8192 but got addr:3086798848
Here I didn't munmap between each mmap call.  In this case 4096 hint got
bumped to 40960 (mmap_min_addr) and worked fine.  A new hint, 8192 also
got bumped to 40960 but the kernel found it couldn't use that and
instead found a whole new open memory area.  Appears to be working as
expected.
