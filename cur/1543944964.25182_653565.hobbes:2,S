Please report this to linux-acpi @ vger . kernel . org...
It is likely caused by the stuff to locate and disable the unused video
device in the DSDT (apparently it got the wrong device?!).
However, BEFORE reporting to linux-acpi, please test it in single user mode
without X *ever* being loaded on that boot.  New X disables the BIOS
brightness changes that ACPI uses.
