Not in IRIX, though.  And I'm afraid of:
cap -c all-i <some setuid binary>
versus
cap -c all+i <some setuid binary>
Suddently the binary's behavior might be different.  This isn't 
inheritantly bad, but it seems like a pointless gotcha.
I like my version of using inheritable for legaciness, but only because my 
inheritable semantics make sense.  Your version would worry me a lot less 
if you just added a new field.  But mine doesn't actually need the new field ;)

It's a bitfield.  Just add fields -- no cost in memory.  Fairly large cost 
in compile time, though...

This only takes effect when set*uid is called successfully.  It bites 
programs that start as non-root with CAP_SETUID and change their uid, but 
these programs either don't exist or don't work at all right now.

Especially with CAP_SYS_ADMIN...  SELinux is clearly the way to go here.
I just discovered a patch 
(
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/security/linux-privs/kernel-2.4-fcap/README
) 
that claims to implement per-process-tree maximum cap masks (like I did for 
  awhile).  It hasn't been maintained, though.
If one of our patches hits -mm or -linus, I may try and add a feature like 
that.  It'll (rightly) annoy the SELinux folks, though.

Except that I fail a lot of your tests because of inheritable mask 
differences.  Oh, well.
I may revive my ext3 caps patch sometime.  Is there a way to make that work 
with your patch?
