Subject: how to purposfully fragment memory?

I'm trying to test code paths dealing with fragmented memory, so I'd 
like to have a simple way to cause fragmented memory in the kernel.  Is 
there any API in the kernel that would let me allocate two contiguous 
pages, then free one of them?
I tried the following, but it triggers an oops in free_page():
unsigned long addr =
	__get_free_pages(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_NORETRY|__GFP_NOWARN, 1);
if (!addr)
	break;
free_page(addr+4096);
Thanks,
Chris
