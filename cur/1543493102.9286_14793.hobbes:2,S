Yes.  That will definitely be there in v1.  Sync writes (including data
writes) will be logged straight to the journal with no seeks.  This is
primarily intended to speed up sync NFS servers.  Of course, you will
still need to write back the data to the main filesystem area, but that
can be done asynchronously.
Hopefully, journaling to a separate disk will also be present in v1,
which will improve performance still further.  Finally, it will support
multiple filesystems sharing a single journal disk, but the error
recovery semantics get really complex there so that mode will not
necessarily be supported in the initial release.
Cheers,
 Stephen
