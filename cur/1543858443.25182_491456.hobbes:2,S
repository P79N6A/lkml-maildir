Indeed, these are contradicting requirements. The RNG detection, as
outlined by Intel documentation, requires being able to write to firmware
hub space (which in turn is hidden behind BIOS space). But I agree that
this is not a good solution (and even without that, it is not good to
require temporarily making invisible the entire BIOS code/data in order
to detect a non-essential device like an RNG).
