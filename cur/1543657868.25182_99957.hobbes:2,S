Yes, that would help a bit.  We should do that for ia32.  It's a little
worrisome that the return value from such a copy_*_user() implementation
will be incorrect - it is supposed to return the number of uncopied bytes.
Probably doesn't matter.
Most of the optimisation opportunities wrt signal delivery were soaked up
by replacing the copy_*_user() calls with put_user() and friends.
We could speed up signals heaps by re-lazying the fpu state storage in
some manner.

hm.  How slow?  Any numbers on that?
