I have to say that my workstation is still helped by reverting this
change and all I do is play around in GIT trees and read email.
It's a slow UltraSPARC-IIIi 1.5GHz machine with a very slow IDE disk
and 2GB of ram.
With the dirty ratio changeset there, I'm waiting for disk I/O
seemingly all the time.  Without it, I only feel the machine seize up
in disk I/O when I really punish it.
Maybe all the dirty I/O is from my not using 'noatime', and if that's
how I should "fix" this then we can ask why isn't it the default? :)
I did mention this when the original changeset went into the tree.
