Mostly because everyone is sick of waiting for me to finish porting and
testing in 2.5.  I removed the changes to fs/super.c from my 2.4 code,
the idea is to get submitted to 2.4 so I can lighten my load and work
harder on the 2.5 port.
We'll see, if I don't have it done before ottawa akpm can throw me in
the river.  Inclusion is a different story of course but they can't
include it if it isn't fully ported ;-)
