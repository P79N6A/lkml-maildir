If a child has a debugger, it clearly is never "stopped" or "zombie" as 
far as the parent is concerned, so the parent should either block, or it 
should return -EAGAIN.

No, you only need to make debugged children slightly pecial in wait4(), in
that the parent must never see their state, only the fact that they are
there (as if they were still running, in short, regardless of their _real_
state)
