Hi Steven,
which vmlinux are you using for analysis? First kernel's vmlinux or
second kernel's vmlinux. You should be using first kernel's vmlinux.
crash is trying to read some symbols from the core file and crash thinks
that virtual address for kernel_config_data is ffffffff8123d1e0. I think
this is too high a address. I guess this will be the address if you
compile your kernel for physical address 16MB. So my first guess is that
you are using second kernel's vmlinux for analysis.
Which kernel version and kexec-tools version are you using?
I am also copying the mail to crash-utility mailing list where folks
keep a watch on crash related issues.
Thanks
Vivek
