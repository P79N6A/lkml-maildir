When I try to poweroff my computer, it reboots.
The only way to turn it off is to change
acpi_sleep_prepare(ACPI_STATE_S5);
to
acpi_sleep_prepare(ACPI_STATE_S4);
in the function acpi_power_off in the file drivers/acpi/sleep/poweroff.c.
I think it's a buggy acpi controller.
What's the side effect of this change?
