Which is more or less the "streaming" feature set in recent
ATA standards. [Alas, streaming and NCQ/TCQ can't be done
with the same access.] SCSI has its Read Write Error Recovery
mode page which doesn't have timeouts but does have Read
and Write Retry Counts amongst other fields that control
the amount (and indirectly the time) of attempted error
recovery.
