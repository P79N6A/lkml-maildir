When I was updating VMware's vmnet, I decided to use
#ifdef skb_shinfo
This gives you maximal backward compatibility, as all public zerocopy
patches contain this macro. Only thing is that Dave has to remember
that when he turns skb_shinfo into inline function, an identity #define have
to be added.
Just my opinion - as you cannot add HAVE_ZEROCOPY to all already existing
and installed kernels.
