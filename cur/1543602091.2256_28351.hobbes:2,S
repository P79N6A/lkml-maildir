You are the second or third person to report high latencies with ALSA
drivers.  I wonder what braindead locking they do?
Good find.

Oh, ok -- its pretty much the number of times the scheduling latency was
greater than the audio buffer time.

You are welcome :)
I should probably take a look at ALSA stuff and see if I can find what
exactly is the culprit.
Thank you for the feedback, now we know.
