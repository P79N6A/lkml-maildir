Hi,
I got a lot such errors log when run dmesg and the rpogram cdda2wav seems stop
extracting audio cds
Some others log like:
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 3260, scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0 0x00 00 00 00 00 00
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 3260, scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0 0x00 00 00 00 00 00
SCSI host 0 abort (pid 3260) timed out - resetting
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
SCSI host 0 channel 0 reset (pid 3260) timed out - trying harder
SCSI bus is being reset for host 0 channel 0.
scsi : aborting command due to timeout : pid 3256, scsi0, channel 0, id 1, lun 0 0xbe 04 00 00 00 00 00 00 4b 10 00 00
hdd: lost interrupt
I use ide-scsi for ide cdrom as cdda2wav requires this. If I use normal ide-cd
and use cdparanoia it works as normal.
What should I do to help debuging this problem?
Regards,
Steve Kieu
