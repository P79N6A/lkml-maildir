You can cause a lot of switches to degrate to HUB mode by overloading their 
arp cache mac address table thingy.  (Fun for packet sniffing when you've got 
a card that can change its mac address in software.  Send packets originating 
from a few thousand different mac IDs and watch the switch throw up its hands 
and go "AAAAAH!".  Sniffing the right init sequence for a pppoe connection 
with nonstandard authentication can be a bit difficult otherwise, with modern 
hardware... :)
I haven't tried it on a very wide variety of manufacturer's switches, though. 
 And I dunno how that relates to CRC behavior...
