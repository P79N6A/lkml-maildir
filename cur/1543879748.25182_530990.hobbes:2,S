thanks. This does has the appearance of a userspace race condition of 
some sorts. Can you trigger this hang with the patch below applied to 
the vanilla tree as well? (with no CFS patch applied)
if yes then this would suggest that Kaffeine has some sort of 
child-runs-first problem. (which CFS changes to parent-runs-first. 
Kaffeine starts a couple of threads and the futex calls are a sign of 
thread<->thread communication.)
[ i have also Cc:-ed the Kaffeine folks - maybe your strace gives them
  an idea about what the problem could be :) ]
