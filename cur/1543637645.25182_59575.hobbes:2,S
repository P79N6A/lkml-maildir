I don't have access to the truely official posix standards document (posix.org 
want's a login and ieee want's dues/subscriptions).  The manual page citation 
is common to linux and sun and was accessable to all readers, between the two 
of them, so I cited it.  Besides, I am citing back the same source as the 
quotes I was getting cited at me... 8-)
Blocking a system call for something that can't be used by the call is dumb.
Repeatedly changing the value of VMIN before each read (doubling your system 
calls/context switches) is dumb.
Having virtually every user on the planet realize this and just set VMIN == 1 
is an fairly telling indicator.
Repeatedly calling the kernel to assemble an input buffer which is necessary 
if VMIN ==1, is dumb.
Having an upper limit of 255 on the number of characters you can wait for in a 
single read, now that communications speeds are usefully large, is dumb.
The lay-programmers I have shown this too so far (a small and unprovable set, 
I know 8-) think blocking for the extra characters is an error.  This is the 
tried-and-true "rule of least astonishment".  It is "astonishing" to make a 
call read(fd,buffer,N), when you know N characters are already buffered, and 
not have it return because VMIN is bigger than N.
The fix for rounding down is one line and breaks nothing on the planet that 
anybody can find (mostly because of the default VMIN==1 everybody uses).
The rounding up part (adds one condition to the afore mentioned and one other 
conditional assignment) is more arguable but still quite a win since there 
isn't a modern serial protocol existant that uses a prefered maximum buffer 
size of less that 256 characters.
So far all I am getting back is one non-public "that's a good idea, but I want 
to see what everybody else thinks" and a bunch of "but the standard says"...
The standard is OLD and UNREALISTIC (and if you get all lawyer-ish, somewhat 
inconsitant and vague.) and the modification is one hundred percent 
compatable with what is in the field and what "more than half" of the users 
expect.
