So it's a bug in the sata_nv.c port driver.
In particular, I see this in the bug report:
>Jun 30 10:23:42 atlantic kernel: ata1: EH in ADMA mode, notifier 0x1 notifier_error 0x0 gen_ctl 0x1501000 status 0x1540 next cpb count 0x0 next cpb idx 0x0
That looks a bit strange, because the driver goes to some effort
to prevent these kind of commands from ever being issued "in ADMA mode",
precisely because there's no way to do a tf_read in that mode.
Mmm.. buggy somewhere in there.
