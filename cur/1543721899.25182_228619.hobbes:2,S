Please forgive me if I'm wrong on this, but I seem to remember reading
something a while ago indicating that the kernel is and always will be
internally English (i.e. debugging messages and the like) as there is no
need to bloat it with many different languages (that can be done in
userspace). As printk is really just a log system, I personally don't
see any way that it should ever print anything other than ASCII.
(Yes, of course some parts of the kernel, like filesystems, do need to
be able to handle UTF-8 etc, but not all.)
