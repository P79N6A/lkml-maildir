If you are reading or writing in a straight line they can probably sustain 
that throughput indefinitely.  The only thing that causes it to drop is seek 
time.
I benchmarked some earlier Cheetah drives about 6-9 months ago.  Reading and 
writing 256k blocks randomly distributed over the disk they managed a 
sustained throughput of a little under 10MB/s.  These are quite fast drives.
