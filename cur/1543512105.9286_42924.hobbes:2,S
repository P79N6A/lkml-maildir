arghhhh... horst, devfs supports ownership, names, links, pipes, etc just
like normal ext2 /dev... and persistence via a daemon. IIRC the only
difference between
devfs and ext2 /dev is that devfs bypasses VFS.
you've been told this already.

it does solve it. As devfs can allocate major/minors dynamically at
run-time, rather than the old way of having to pre-allocate major/minors to
all possible permutations of devices.
you've been told this already.

devfs solves this perfectly. the reason being that the driver does know at
runtime which disk is on which controller/bus/id/lun. And so the driver can
register disks with appropriate names like c0b1t2u0.. etc. 
this has been stated already.

ok, rather than just saying "no.. no.. no..". Why can't we have a
constructive argument where you say "no, you'd probably need to do it
something more like xyz".
