Ok, I am having some troubles burning CDs/DVDs. I am using k3b as front-end 
and it has troubles to detect the type of disc inserted. If you eg insert a 
cd-rw the dialog changes the detected medium around (about each second): 
cd-rom, cd-rw, etc. Same with DVD+R. It detects DVD+R, waiting a second, than 
appendable DVD+R etc. But then it thinks it is a RW so it wants to 
blank/format/whatever it and this breaks, ie. I can't start the burning. It 
worked fine with a DVD+RW though. And ignoring the message and blanking in 
menu, I could also write a cd-rw.
I am not sure what is causing the problem. Could dbus/hal be also trouble 
makers? I don't know whether k3b is making something stupid, as well. Last 
time I tried I had no problem with the ide driver though. So I don't know 
whether ATAPI support in libata still needs polishing or whether Alan's PATA 
patch is missing something or whatever...
What infos should I provide to make diagnosis easier?
