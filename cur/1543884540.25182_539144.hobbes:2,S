The old IDE driver for JMicron didn't work well for me either,
running on Kubuntu Edgy 2.6.17.  It would find the PATA DVD drive,
and work okay for the first half of a DVD movie playback, and then go bonkers.
I eventually gave up on it and installed a pure SATA DVD drive on ICH7(8?)
and just disabled the JMicron completely.
Kernel upgrades are not currenly a viable option for this box
(too many other things would need to be fiddled with).
Cheers
