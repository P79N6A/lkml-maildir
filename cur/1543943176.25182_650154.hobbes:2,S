In the future please contact postmaster@vger.kernel.org when you
notice you have been unsubscribed so we can work on fixing the
issue.
Blind resubscriptions are severely frowned upon, we remove you for
good reason and if the problem isn't solved you'll just soil up my
inbox further with bounces....
