I found out why : I had an old pre-2.6.18 .config hanging around in
/boot on _many_ of my systems and upgraded to a newer vanilla kernel
using these defaults. make oldconfig left
CONFIG_DEFAULT_IOSCHED="anticipatory".
Changing to CONFIG_DEFAULT_IOSCHED="cfq" makes everything run better
under heavy I/O. I bet I'm not the only one in this situation.
