 Nice. It'll be interesting when you start concurrent tests. I think the last 
fixes from -mm made it better, but I'm still getting DLM errors and processes 
hung in D state when using tar concurrently reading kernel trees on 3 nodes. 
I'd like to know if you'll get the same or not.
 I'll be sending kernel messages and a more complete report later this 
evening.
