        Hello folks...
     After another complain on #kernelnewbies about the OOM killer doing
  strange thingss, by killing small processes when its really not needed,
  and not doing anything when its really OOM i ran out of nerves and came out
  with an idea, which i believe already settled down is some brains.
    I speak about providing in /proc list of process badnesses, possibly with
  some additional info...
    Its just a shame to have a stable kernel randomly killing processes even when 
  its not needed...
  (this message was planned as answer to Linus request for any kind of VM bitchig....)
regards, Samium Gromoff
