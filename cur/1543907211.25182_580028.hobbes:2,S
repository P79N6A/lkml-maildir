Mmm, bad news, after 4 hours of intensive network stressing, one of the 2 3com card failed with the latest fedora kernel.
Aug  6 22:31:09 loki kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth2: transmit timed out
Aug  6 22:31:09 loki kernel: eth2: transmit timed out, tx_status 00 status e601.
Aug  6 22:31:09 loki kernel:   diagnostics: net 0ccc media 8880 dma 0000003a fifo 8000
Aug  6 22:31:09 loki kernel: eth2: Interrupt posted but not delivered -- IRQ blocked by another device?
Aug  6 22:31:09 loki kernel:   Flags; bus-master 1, dirty 26085000(8) current 26085000(8)
Aug  6 22:31:09 loki kernel:   Transmit list 00000000 vs. ffff81007c807700.
Stressing eth2 by copying large files on a samba on share and eth0 by downloading big files on the internet.
