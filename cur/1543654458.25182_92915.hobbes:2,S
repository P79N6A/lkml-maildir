Perhaps; but in my mind the concept of `symbol' (in C) is sort of fuzzy,
and conflated with the objects to which they refer.  If I see
   x = symbol_get(some_variable);
it _looks_, at first glance, like it's going to return the value of
some_variable (maybe this simply indicates that I'm a moron, but anyway).
This:
   x = symbol_addr(some_variable);
is a whole lot more obvious, I think, regardless of how clued in you are.
