I think you can make it non-guaranteeable.

You can't guarantee you can guess a password.  You could for example
write a pam module that mandates a 3 second delay on failed
authentication for a user (it does it for the console currently; use 3
separate consoles and you can do the attack 3 times faster).  Now you
have to guess the password with one try every 3 seconds.
aA1# 96 possible values per character, 8 characters.  7.2139x10^15
combinations.  It takes 686253404.7 years to go through all those at one
every 3 seconds.  You've got a good chance at half that.
This isn't "hard," it's "infeasible."  I think the idea is to make it so
an attacker doesn't have to put lavish amounts of work into creating an
exploit that reliably re-exploits a hole over and over again; but to
make it so he can't make an exploit that actually works, unless it works
only by rediculously remote chance.

Yes.  Nobody code audits your binaries.  You need source code to do
source code auditing.  :)
