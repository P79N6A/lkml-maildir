Random pids in a 32 bit space would take an average of ~1 random number
generation to calculate per fork. That can't be too slow can it? It would
perhaps be a more stable performance statistic than our current scheme
because the current scheme can hit a block of in-use pids and thus the
time to work out a suitable pid had a greater variance.
WRT the security issues; predictable pids have always assisted the cause
of the cracker. Any extra difficulty we can generate is always
useful. Obviously it's only worth considering for 32bit pids not 16bit.
Cheers
