Subject: [PATCH 09/22] ide-tape: remove idetape_increase_max_pipeline_stages()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/4/121

This function was being used only at one place so fold it in there.
