I don't care much for solaris...  A friend has a sparc server 690 and
there's no vme support in solaris7.  He wasn't happy.

I thought it had a rj45 on the back of it?!  My sparc10 board has one and
aui.

My friend said linux would run on it, but the sound wouldn't work and linux
doesn't support the framebuffer, but some version of X does.

No cdrom?  Ouch...  My sparc booted just fine with debian's 2.1 cd.

I saw the scsi hdd..  Never seen a 2.5" scsi.  This place that's selling off
their sparcbooks are giving a 170mb ata pcmcia card with it and a few other
things.  The nice thing is it has a modem and a nic so you don't need any
pcmcia cards.  Oh, I'm not sure if pcmcia supports this either.
