Similar problem occured at my box, but it's not kernel 2.6.9 which breaks
SSH. At leat for me...
If you are running FC3T3, then try to remount /dev. Since some version of
udev obsoletes the dev package and afterwards no /dev/pts/* exists, since
dev is no longer there and udev 'overmounted' /dev...
Best,
 Oliver
