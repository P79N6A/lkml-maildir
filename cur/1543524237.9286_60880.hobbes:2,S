Hi Tigran,
your patch seems to work. I stress-tested my squid by mirroring
a local webserver. I never saw the 'kmalloc' message again.
I'm now investigating 'connection stalls' ... sometimes it takes quite long
before squid establishes a connection to my local webserver. I don't think
that related to your patch.
Anyway, thanks a lot,
Patrick
PS: Did you submit the patch to linus ? I hope it gets into the next
    2.3.42-preX or 2.3.42.
