I don't know if there is application using the POSIX_FADV_RANDOM. No? If
this is the truth, I think we don't need this optimization at present.
Logically reservation does not benefit seeky random write, but there is
no benchmark showing performance issue so far. We have already provided
ways for applications turn off reservation through the existing ioctl
for specified file and -o noreservation mount option for the whole
filesystem.

I agree.
