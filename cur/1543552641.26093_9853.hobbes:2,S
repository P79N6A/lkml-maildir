No, I have the bios of the controller disabled.
The problem with that is that on boot up (for lilo) the internal disk
is disk number one. But when I'm in the system and want to install lilo
it's disk number two - that's what lilo is complaining about on boot up.
(By spewing out an L and a 01 01 01 01 and so on).
Activating the bios of the QLOGIC (to make the internal disk appear
to be the 2nd one on bootup) didn't solve the problem too - I simply
got a message saying I should insert a system disk ;)
	CU, Klaus
