but unlike the task balancer, moving an irq is really expensive.
(at least for networking and a few other similar systems)
ANd no it's not just the cache bouncing, it's the entire reassembly of
multiple packets etc etc that gets really messy.

you misunderstood this; the classification stuff is there to spread
different irqs of similar class (say networking) over multiple
cores/packages. Doing this is a system resource balancing proposition
not just a cpu time one. 
You may think this spreading based on classification is a mistake, but
it's based on the following observation: 
1) servers with multiple network cards serving internet traffic out
really need to load balance their loads; this is for various per-cpu
resource reasons (such as per cpu memory pools) to be evenly used. It
also makes sure that under network spikes on both interfaces, the
response is sane
2) servers with multiple IO devices need this to be spread out, just
think of oracle etc.
for both you could argue "but we could balance this based on actual
observed load in some way", but you can only do that if you rebalance
at a relatively high frequency, which you really don't want to do for
networking and probably even storage.
We used to rebalance this frequently in the 2.4-early kernels based on
a patch from Ingo. Turned out to be a really really bad idea;
performance really tanked.

"hacks" as in "rescan".. so falls under the topology code and would
indeed be changed to hook into hotplug inside the kernel; just
different complexity.

I know you can do SOME sort of balancing in the kernel. But please
describe the algorithm you would use; I started out with the same
thought but when it got down to the algorithm to me at least it became
clear "we really don't want this complexity in kernel mode".

if you don't care about kernel unpagable memory footprint, fine.
Others do.

I'm not arguing against doing irqbalancing per se (heck that's why I
wrote irqbalance); just that every time I try to do it in kernel the
complexity to get the behavior people (and benchmarks) want turns me
right off that again.

and it will know how much cpu they take and it'll move work around to
compensate for any unfairness. CFS is really good at that.

for now yes. I agree the kernel "knows" this to some form (well it
COULD know). I just don't believe the "extra" information it has is in
practice useful for making decisions on.

yes; the power aware scheduler also moves processes to the first
package .. as does irqbalance.

not really; CFS has shown that.... the only real policy in task
balancing is the fairness part, and that seems to be general accepted
as the right thing.

no it doesn't; it uses "packet counts" to deal with NAPI and other
effects such as irq mitigation to get a more accurate estimate of load
caused by an irq, but it's not fair to call this inappropriate checking
for NAPI being turned on.
