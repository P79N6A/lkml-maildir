Well this backtrace is not the reason why ide-scsi fails to work - it is
being triggered as a consequence of the I/O failure.
This trace is due to the following bug:
scsi_try_to_abort_cmd() takes spin_lock_irqsave(scmd->host->host_lock, flags);
then it calls ide_scsi_abort()
ide_scsi_abort() calls scsi_sleep(), still inside ->host_lock.
