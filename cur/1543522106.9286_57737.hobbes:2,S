	This bug was introduced in 2.3.37, when the ISAPnP driver moved to
list_head structures. The included patch should fix it. isapnp_find_dev()
is called from isapnp_set_device() with from == NULL.
	The second chunk of the patch is subject to a disagreement
between me and Martin Mares. I think it should be in for completeness, and
so that uninitialised data structures aren't left lying around. Martin
thinks it shouldn't be in since dev->children has no meaning for ISAPnP
cards. You pays your money and takes your choice. Leave it in or out as
you see fit, it won't bite anyone (yet ;-)).
