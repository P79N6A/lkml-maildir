Annotations are a different thing. Personally, I don't like adding them.

  - It will fix bugs of the type: add #include <x.h> to y.c because on some
    architectures x.h isn't automatically pulled in by z.h.
  - It would help in cleaning up the zillions of includes in the .c files,
    decreasing compile time.
  - It would make it easier for developers, since if you need something, you
    just have to explicitly include the header file that defines it, and not
    have to find out the hard way what other stuff to include.
I agree, that's not that many `real bugs'.
