Subject: bug in 2.6.16-mm1 - snd-ad1816a is not being loaded

Hi folks,
I've tried Bjorn Hellgaas' patch which is included in 2.6.16-mm1. Thanks for
his attempts. But the problem still persists:
snd-ad1816a still refuses to load and dmesg still talks about a PnP
configuration error. If you need additional information, please tell me how
to produce it. 2.6.16 without mm1 works fine so far.
Ciao
Uwe
P. S.: In the first lines of dmesg the card is being recognized and the card
ID is being printed out to the console. But as soon as it goes to loading
the driver module the whole thing is broken and the module is not being
loaded, while dmesg prints out a PnP configuration error.
