If the CPU starts off owning both cache lines, and if there are no intervening
invalidation requests from other CPUs, then the writing CPU knows that there
could not possibly have been any intervening writes.

With one important exception -- the CPU that did the write knows.
There is no requirement that each and every CPU see each and every write.
The only requirement is that the sequence of values that each CPU sees
for a single given variable is consistent with that of each other CPU.
