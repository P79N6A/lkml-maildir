Subject: [RFC: 2.6 patch] remove broken net drivers
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch removes net drivers that:
- had already been marked as BROKEN in 2.6.0 three years ago and
- are still marked as BROKEN.
These are the following drivers:
- MAC89x0
- ATARI_BIONET
- ATARI_PAMSNET
- SKMC
Drivers that had been marked as BROKEN for such a long time seem to be 
unlikely to be revived in the forseeable future.
But if anyone wants to ever revive any of these drivers, the code is 
still present in the older kernel releases.
