printk that doesn't start a new line had KERN_* removed because it prints in
the middle of line KERN_* macros like
 id: 0xb4 <7> io: 0x340 <6>eth0: Intel EtherExpress Pro/10+ ISA
i had the same reaction but Michael pointed this to me. i don't know exactly
how this macro works, but you'll have the line printed out with the
beggining using KERN_* macro. isn't that sufficient?
