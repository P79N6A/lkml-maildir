There are three options:
 - clean up the kernel header so it works from user space
 - get the appropriate definitions included in the libc
 - include the definitions somewhere else, either in your application or in 
   some new library invented for the purpose.
In most cases the latter is probably best.

It's not really the kernel's job to provide the user space API.
