nwfs is just a module and can be build outside the kernel tree.
xfs requires lots of infrastructure in the kernel that it basically requires
its own kernel tree, which can be gotten from the oss.sgi.com CVS repository.

The Linux implementation of JFS is not journaled yet, so it is very likely
to be faster than reiserfs for meta data intensive operations (like 
creating lots of small files in a compile) because it doesn't
do any journal IO.
