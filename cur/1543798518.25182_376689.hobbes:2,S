I see it as a stepping stone for RT ;)

That just looks plain ugly.  Still, if you want to keep the major archs
unchanged (at least until RT is in!) then just add the following:
#define mutex_lock(x) down(x)
#define mutex_unlock(x) up(x)
#define mutex_trylock(x) (!down_trylock(x))  /* see previous email! */
Then you can add your ugly patch ;) where on debug we define those
declared with DEFINE_SEM(x) add the this_is_not_a_mutex = 1
