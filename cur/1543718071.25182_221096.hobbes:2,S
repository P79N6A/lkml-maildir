I'm actually sticking with 2.4 for right now, which I'd be more than happy 
to test on.  How different would your patch be for 2.4?
I am unfamiliar with dmidecode, I am afraid.
If you can't get the requisite info for 2.6 I would be happy to move one of 
my systems with the issue over to it to get the info.  Please let me know.
FWIW I saw a post from somebody on netdev and madwifi-users who says he is 
using your 2.6 patch with no problems.
