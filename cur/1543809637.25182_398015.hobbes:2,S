Brainstorming ... what do you think about having a special init process
inside the child to act as a proxy of sorts?  It is controlled by the
parent vserver/container, and would not be subject to resource limits.
It would not necessarily need to fork in order to kill other processes
inside the vserver (not subject to resource limits).  It could also
continue when the rest of the guest was suspended.
A pid killer would be ineffective against such a process because you
can't kill init.

You can't ptrace init, right?

Where does that lead you?  Having a single global pid space which the
admin can see?  Or, does a special set of system calls do it well
enough?
