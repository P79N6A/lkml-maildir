Oh, I see... you don't really mean NULL in the first argument :)
This has one additional advantage: an application which wants to
override vsyscalls can simply map something instead of the kernel page,
and UML can present its own vsyscall page.

That's a possiblity, or if the task_struct contains the desired return
address for a particular process that might also work -- it's just a GPR
after all.
