i'd not do this patch, mainly because the '100 priority levels' thing is 
pretty much an assumption in lots of userspace code. The patch to make 
it easier to redefine it is of course fine and was accepted, but i dont 
think we want to make it explicit via .config.
It's a bit like with the 3:1 split: you can redefine it easily via 
include files, but it's not configurable via .config, because many 
people would just play with it and would see things break.
so unless there's really a desire from distributions to actually change 
the 100 RT-prio levels (and i dont sense such a desire), we shouldnt do 
this.
