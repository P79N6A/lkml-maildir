gcc (plus lint and many other compilers) give this warning because it's
too easy to write:
	if ( a = b )
when what you wanted was
	if ( a == b )
It doesn't mean that the former is wrong -- it just means that the
second form is what the programmer usually wanted.
It's particularly easy to make this mistake if (as I do) you code in
both C and an ALGOL based language. In ALGOL, the C construct:
	if ( a = b )
is coded as
	IF A := B THEN
while
	if ( a == b )
is written as
	IF A = B THEN
In other words, in C "=" means assignment while in ALGOL "=" means
equality. As you mentioned in an earlier post, lint is silent if you
write:
	if ((a = b))
thus signifying that you really wanted
	if ( a = b )
and not
	if ( a == b )
