There may be code out there which gets confused on receiving a SIGCLD
for (or wait()ing on) a child which it doesn't remember creating.
Potentially confusing existing code is a security issue.

I haven't looked at the code, but it should (IMO) be cleared on exec
and on fork()s and clone()s which don't specify either of the new flags.
