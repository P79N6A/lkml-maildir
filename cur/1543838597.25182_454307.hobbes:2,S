It doesn't? Indeed it does not! Alt-F1 does it though and it is much harder
to hid by accident (I can't count how many times I hit that key by accident
on windows box and then have to grab mouse to switch focus back to the window
that had it before). Anyway, it is indeed offtopic for kernel, try asking on
KDE lists...

No, it is not overheating, just the act of polling battery status or
temperature may cause pointer stalls on some boxes.
