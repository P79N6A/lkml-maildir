I'm seeing something similar on RH7.2 with the emu10K driver.
Except XMMS and the cd player result in nothing but noise, but
the window manager events sound fine. The volume of noise
from XMMS/CD player can be controlled by the mixer.
Machine is a dual P3-450, GX chip set.
I saw this with both the base RH7.2 kernel and the latest RH
kernel (2.4.9-??). RH 7.1 worked fine on the same hardware.
I tried playing with mixer settings and IRQ settings with no difference.
