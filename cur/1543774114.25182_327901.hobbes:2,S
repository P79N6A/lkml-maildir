Sorry for the noise, I replied in a second mail that I was perfectly OK
with this usage. What I though you wanted to propose was the simplest for
of enum where only the first value is specified, and which is a nightmare
to debug afterwards. Bill Gatliff also suggested that gdb can display and
use the symbolic values while it's not the case on defines.
