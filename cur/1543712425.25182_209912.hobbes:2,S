Mostly agreed:
Like I mentioned in the last message, the IO scheduler and the VM should 
really just figure out request size and queue depth and such based on 
observation of device throughput and latency.  So I agree w/ automagic.
But the sysadmin should also be allowed to say "I don't care about 
latency" if he has gobs and gobs of memory and knows his configuration well.
I like generic tunables such as "laptop mode" or "low latency" or "high 
throughput".  These sorts of tunables should affect the "automagic" 
calculations.
