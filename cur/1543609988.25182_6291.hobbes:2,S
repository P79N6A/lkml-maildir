Yes, I experienced exactly this problem yesterday. The login hangups
were *not* to do with kernel problems, or overheating, but merely the
'gpm' service trying to play with a non-existent mouse.
After booting the system into Red Hat's canned 2.4.9-13smp, I compiled
2.4.15-pre4 [in about 2.5 minutes :) ]  and rebooted. The machine came
up, but the networking was totally screwed. I rebuilt the kernel, adding
several more config options in the networking section (including
"Routing Messages", and it works beautifully now.
I've since built 2.4.15-pre5, which is also fine. Presumably, this
patch has also fixed most of the merge bugs in -pre4? I had problems
building -pre4 on other machines.
Cheers
