Hmm. I, too, would have liked these drives to show as two LUNs.
My Creative DVD-RAM does not.
I am using a patch of similar type to Rogier's, which I presume is likewise
descended from the Japanese MO patch. His is much nicer than mine and seems
to cover the Creative, so I will soon take to using his.
Anyway, the upshot is that the Creative, at least, does not ship in a config
which shows is as two LUNs. I believe (but have no proof yet) that the Creative drive is a rebadged Panasonic LD-101F(?). I'd love it to show as two LUNs!
