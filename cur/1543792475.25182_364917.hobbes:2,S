Good point.
I tested your suggested patch fix and it works well in my test use case.
BTW, I've got test code in my just tested version of your patch to read the
kref of the sdev_gendev between the calls to scsi_run_queue and
put_device to increase the likelihood that the use case has actually
been tested.
