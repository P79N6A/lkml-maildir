The former looks fine (but I'ld rather cc that to VM folks). The latter
is patently useless - for one thing, caller doesn't give a damn for
the exact error value, for another it couldn't pass it further even
if it wanted. We have no way to tell what went wrong when IO request
fails - every async error turns into -EIO.
