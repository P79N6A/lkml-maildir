You know, not releasing source code doesn't  make "IP" violations
magically disappear, so if anything you should be more suspicious about
closed source drivers infringing others patents than anything.

If you have to worry about "IP", you're screwed no matter if you release
source or not.  The only problem is that it might be trickier for the
other party to prove.  The only case where a closed source driver makes
some kind of sense from an "IP" point of view is when you're trying to
protect your own code (or code you have licensed).

Well, you can always make a contribution by using public transportation
or switching to low energy light bulbs.  Every little thing counts =)
