Raid can do this easily because they install the raid on fresh partitions so
they can easily "steal" the last sector, and the filesystem goes in the
"shrinked" raid-device. Normal partitions that already have a filesystem on
them (maybe another OS formatted them) occupy space including the last
sector - no place left on these partitions to baptize them. - how should
that work with existing fs'es???
