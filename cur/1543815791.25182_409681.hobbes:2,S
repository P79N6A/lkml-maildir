How should that work since CPUID cannot be intercepted by

So how would your Hypervisor detect a kernel hung with interrupts

Right now yes, but if we ever implement intelligent memory ECC error handling it's questionable
the hypervisor can do a better job. It has far less information about how memory
is used than the kernel.

Did I miss it or do you never describe how to find these entry points?

A subtle trap is also that it will do so on the next instruction, not the 
followon to next like a real x86.  At some point there was code in Linux
that dependend on this.

So what happens when the kernel tries to access an unimplemented MSR?
Also we have had occasionally workarounds in the past that required 
MSR writes with magic "passwords". How would these be handled?

Doesn't seem to be very useful because everybody can just call CPUID directly.

Yes, but it will be wrong in a native kernel too so why do you want
to be better than native? 
Seems useless to me.

Similar.
Overall feeling is you have far too many calls. You seem to try to implement
a full x86 replacement, but that makes it big and likely to be buggy. And 
it's likely impossible to implement in any Hypervisor short of a full emulator
like yours.
I would try a diet and only implement facilities that are actually likely
to be used by modern OS.
There was one other point I wanted to make but I forgot it now @)
