(added to CC list, just to update people on the status of these 
warnings...  I know they're annoying)
Thanks, but like I told someone else just yesterday, I'm not interested 
in patches which simply shift the warnings around.
You need something _far_ more substantial, like what I have attached, 
which updates libata to use the iomap infrastructure.
The warnings are there to let me (and others) know where the changes 
need to be made.  Applying a patch like yours will almost guarantee that 
I will miss a spot that needs to be converted.
Attachments:
patch.1:  97% of the iomap conversion.
patch.2:  add kernel infrastructure to map, and store, a bunch of PCI 
BARs.  For many IDE controllers, one must map 5-6 PCI BARs, but for 
others, everything is aggregated into a single MMIO PCI BAR.
The remaining task is to marry the two attached patches, and the work is 
complete.
