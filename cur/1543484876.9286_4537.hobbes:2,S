There are a number of important Linux Documentation Project documents
which are unmaintained.  We would welcome anyone who has the ambition,
talent, and hardware to maintain them.  They're in the
HOWTO/unmaintained directory.  Information on contacting the
coordinator is available from the LDP web site,
http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/.
  Take a look also in Linux/docs, and if
you see anything that looks interesting, give the coordinator a shout.
If you can't reach them, give me a shout, and I'll get 'hold of 'em.
Thanks!
