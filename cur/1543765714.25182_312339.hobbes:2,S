Sorry for this dumb question.
I am trying to install Fedora Core 2 on a dell PowerEdge  2850 with
three 73GB SCSI disks on a RAID 4e/DI controller. I set it up as Raid
5. but when I tried to install FC2, it always complaint that no disk
drive can be found.
Can anybody give me some advice on how to address thsi problem? Many
thanks in advance.
Xin
