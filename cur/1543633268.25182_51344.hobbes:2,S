Subject: [PATCH] Make IDE and DevFS get along

        Martin,
        A feature/patch from one of the generic IDE patchsets was introduced 
into kernels >= 2.5.19 that, when DevFS is used, creates a directory called 
/dev/ata, and a symlink to /dev/ata, called /dev/ide. This setup breaks DevFS' 
use, as it does not follow the symlink when the IDE driver is initialised. 
DevFS uses /dev/ide, which is the published interface, to create the 
symlinks to /dev/hd*, which are created after reading /etc/fstab to get the 
partitions. When /dev/ata is used, DevFS doesn't know what it is, can't find 
/dev/ide/* for the /dev/hd* symlinks to be created, and drops into single user 
mode to fix. This will always happen for anyone with their root partition on 
an IDE drive, with DevFS used. The following patch fixes this problem.
                                                        BL.
        P.S. The only other way around this, would be to rewrite /etc/fstab to 
find the full patch to the /dev/ata/host*.../part1 partition for / . That 
really shouldn't have to be done.
