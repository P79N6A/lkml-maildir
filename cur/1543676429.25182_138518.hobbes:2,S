yes, it pretty awful.  the problem is that this will take some changes
to user space stuff as well to be done right.  so i was hoping to put
it off till 2.7 and hopefully get something that's smp stable for 
2.6.

i would be willing to review patches.  my concern is to have something
stable for 2.6.  making atm more compliant with the netdevice framework
will make it easier to maintain in the future (or so i hope).
