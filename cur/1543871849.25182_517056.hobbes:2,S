Well, I hope a prefetch(NULL) is OK because we are doing millions of them (see 
include/linux/list.h :) )

Yes very true, I will change that and push to Andrew for mm testing
I was thinking about being able to cache the name into the dentry, do you 
think it's worth the pain ? (its not SMP safe for example...)
static char * pipefs_dname(struct dentry *dentry, char *buffer, int buflen)
{
        if (!dentry->d_iname[0])
                snprintf(dentry->d_iname,
			DNAME_INLINE_LEN_MIN,
			"pipe:[%lu]",
			dentry->d_inode->i_ino);
        strlcpy(buffer, dentry->d_iname, buflen);
        return buffer;
}
