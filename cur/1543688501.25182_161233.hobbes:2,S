Hi all,
I just bought a new motherboard, CPU and RAM. With the last computer 
everything worked fine under 2.4 and 2.6. Now it's not that way any 
more. I can run 2.4.22, but it's slow (All of 2.4 series kernel's I 
tested seem to be slow), then I hooked up 2.6.0-test4, booted, 
everything looked fine, but then when I tryed to install NVIDIA drivers, 
I get many errors about nv_kern_read_agpinfo, yes, I tested 
2.6.0-test1-3 too, but when I boot the IRQ #19 get's some errors, but in 
2.6.0-test4 no errors in boot, but I can't compile nvidia card drivers! 
This may be off-topic, but I think this is the best way for getting 
help. (Yes, I patched nvidia_kernel too, so it's not about that, and the 
same package worked on old computer really well, with the same graphic 
card). My chipset is NForce2, and needs NVIDIA NForce/NForce2 so the agp 
can work with full power. Thank you.
