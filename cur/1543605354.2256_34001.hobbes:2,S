so are you saying that BSD licened modules are not going to be allowed to
use any future entry points (assuming they are all put under the the
export_symbol_gpl limits)?
saying that existing stuff will not change doesn't answer the problem
about licences that may have source avilable (tainting) but may not. if
you assume either way you will cause a bunch of problems.
