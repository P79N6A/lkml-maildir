btw., MSI is not really needed to avoid the sharing of irqs: x86 has 224 
IRQ vectors which is abundant for all but the largest boxes. Even the 
smallest laptop tends to have an IO-APIC with at least 24 pins - which 
is enough to never have to share irqs. How system designers can still 
end up with mapping so many devices to the same pin is really their 
fault.
so MSI's only true accomplishment AFAICS is that it now says on the 
hardware level that "you must not share IRQs". Well, doh...
