Unless this update into the FPGA takes a significant amount of time, I 
wouldn't bother with that complexity - just do spin_lock_irq/irqsave on 
that spinlock.
Using a trylock for this rather sucks since the behavior is entirely 
non-deterministic. It could take a really long time in some cases for 
the trylock to ever succeed.
