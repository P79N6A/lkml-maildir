Subject: increase AT_VECTOR_SIZE to terminate saved_auxv properly
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

include/asm-powerpc/elf.h has 6 entries in ARCH_DLINFO.
fs/binfmt_elf.c has 14 unconditional NEW_AUX_ENT entries and 2
conditional NEW_AUX_ENT entries.
So in the worst case, saved_auxv does not get an AT_NULL entry at the
end.
Is an AT_NULL entry required or must userspace use the AT_VECTOR_SIZE
to not loop past the end of the array?
If AT_NULL is required, AT_VECTOR_SIZE should be changed from 44 to 46.
