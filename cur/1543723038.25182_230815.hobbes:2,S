Bring lo up before bring others up.
What does prevent you from doing this?
(Do we need some bits to do this automatically?)

IPv6 creates kernel routes for local addresses on lo to receive
packets for local address.
Well, someone probably wants to have
static local routes on ethX + temprary (cache) local routes on lo
(as IPv4 does; correct me if I'm wrong.)
But this won't work because IPv6 does DAD when we make some interface up.
We need lo anyway.
