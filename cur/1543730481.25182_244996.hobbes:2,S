Thank you, Nick. Just wanted to mention that while I understand that we 
recover from this allocation failure (and also I don't mind the stack 
printouts), about 20% of my incoming network traffic (600-700 Mbps) 
seems to be dropped in the process. Does the memory manager have to 
spend a considerable amount of time to recover?
I will have a look at the -mm fixes, thanks for the idea.
