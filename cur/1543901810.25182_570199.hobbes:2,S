Running either vanilla or Gentoo kernels, I've had no luck at all with
4k stacks.  On SATA+MD(raid1)+LVM+XFS I've had numerous crashes when
doing even light I/O.  One particularly crash-prone scenario is
writing to random locations in sparse files, thus forcing new blocks
to be allocated.
I don't have dedicated testing machines, so I can't afford the time
and potential data loss of testing this regularly.  I have no shortage
on RAM with 8k stacks, so for me the choice is quite simple.
