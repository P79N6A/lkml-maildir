Well, since the kernel is using up a whole 1GB for itself, from a
naive point of view, it might seem a target for reclamation.

This is default linker script (SVR4 ABI) stuff, the portion of the process
address space reserved for the kernel extends from 3GB to 4GB in Linux.
It's fully well possible to link and run executables so that they are
loaded at the first page above the zero page, though little does it.
Cheers,
