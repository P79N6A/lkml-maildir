Yea, I would strongly dissuade anyone from using the rdtsc counter for
anything but statistical analysis of code performance.

Yea, honestly I doubt gettimefoday performance will ever be as good as
rdtsc. I mean, that's a single instruction vs syscall overhead +
hardware clock reading + frequency conversion + ntp adjustment. Its just
not a fair comparison. 
On the other hand, I bet reading a random 64 bits out of memory is also
a bit faster then gettimeofday() as well ;)
I don't mean to promise the world. The point of the patch is not to
improve gettimeofday performance, it is to improve the subsystem so it
is correct and manageable, so that we have the flexibility to make
future improvements (such as High-res Timers, Dynamic Ticks/Variable
system timer, and virtualization needs) without impacting performance.
The best payout for gettimeofday performance will probably be in
vsyscall implementations such as what x86-64 already has. My new
infrastructure also supports this (it had to for x86-64), and I've even
got a proof of concept patch for i386 (see the lkml archives for
details).
thanks
