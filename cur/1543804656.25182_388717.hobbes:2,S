Would it not be more correct to have "+m" to show that the register is both an input and an
output, and nothing more?
Or is set_bit supposed to be a general barrier or fence?
static inline void set_bit(int nr, volatile unsigned long * addr)
{
	__asm__ __volatile__( "lock ; "
		"btsl %1,%0"
		:"+m" (ADDR)
		:"Ir" (nr));
}
