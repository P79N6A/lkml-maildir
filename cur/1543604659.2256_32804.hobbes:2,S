It is better to define CONFIG_CRC32 and have the Config.in files set
CONFIG_CRC32 for selected drivers.  That avoids the problem of lots of
drivers wanting to patch the same Makefile, instead the selection of
crc32 is kept with the driver selection.
lib/Makefile
obj-$(CONFIG_CRC32) += crc32.o
drivers/foo/Config.in
if [ "$CONFIG_FOO" = "y" ]; then
  define_bool CONFIG_CRC32 y
fi
It is even cleaner in CML2.
require FOO implies CRC32=y
In general it is a bad idea to handle selections in the Makefile, that
is what CML is for.  Makefiles should just build the code based on CML
output, not try to decide what to build.
