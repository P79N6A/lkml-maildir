TThe problem with that is the concept of heads is flawed... there is
in reality no such
thing, you have crtcs and outputs, no heads. So any attempt to enforce
the head concept involves putting policy into the kernel, as if I have
3 outputs but 2 crtcs how do I decide the mappings without the admin
telling the kernel,
As for moving other card drivers they will move as people see fit to
move them there probably isn't much gain in moving single crtc/output
cards..
