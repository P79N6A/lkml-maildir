How hard and/or insane would it be to somehow special-case SIGKILL?
It is a tad annoying not to be able to get rid of D state processes,
especially ones blocking unmounts because the filesystem is busy.
Of course, an alternative is a real, brutal, forced unmount that
leaves a clean filesystem and dead/dying processes.
