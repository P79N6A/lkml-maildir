Linus,
This changeset adds module refcounting for TTY line disciplines. I've sent the patch to LKM earlier.
No negative comments (actually most people didn't seem to care). This is needed at least for 
Bluetooth and IrDA (Jean is ok with the patch).
Please pull from

This will update the following files:

Thanks
