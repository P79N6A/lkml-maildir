I'm more devoted to ".s" than I am to ".S", so if anybody
wants to rename 1400 files, go right ahead.   >:-)

Actually, I'm betting that "required to build product"
is a magic phrase that overrides corporate IT's desire

If the developers themselves actually want Windows, well,

For MacOS X, simply mount a UFS filesystem.
