No, the current kernel code is correct. ATAPI devices are self
identifying, and report their type in response to the the ATAPI IDENTIFY
device command. At that point in the code, the drive type will be
in the "type" local variable":
	0 - IDE floppy, 1 - IDE tape, 5 - IDE cdrom
The goal of the function is to set "drive->media" to the drive type,
so that theoretically we could have just done:
	drive->media = type
However, early CDROM devices identified themself as "type 0", which
requires special logic to decide between ATAPI 	CDROM and floppy drives.
This problem was identified in SFF8070, the ATAPI floppy specs, and to
help solve it, the specification required that the drive name will
contain the string "floppy" for ATAPI floppy drives. Nevertheless, we
have ATAPI drives with type 0 which don't include it, such as the ATAPI
ZIP drive. Therefore, in the absence of a hint from the user using
a kernel command line parameter:
If the string contains the word "CD-ROM", we identify the drive as a
CDROM (this will correctly identify the pre-ATAPI NEC 260 cdrom model).
Otherwise, it is identified as a floppy, to be compatible with new
drives.
If the user supplied a "hdx=cdrom" command line paramter, drive->media
will be set to ide_cdrom at this point, and we will follow the user's
selection regardless of both the drive's identification type and
the strstr logic.
