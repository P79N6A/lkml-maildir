I understand your point.  But if we want these under-privileges to
follow the same inheritance rules as the over-privileges provided by
capabilities (were it only to make things simpler to comprehend),
doesn't it make sense to implement them in the same framework?  Rather
than trying to reproduce the same rules in a different part of the
kernel, causing code reduplication which would eventually, inevitably,
fall out of sync...  I think it's easier for everyone if under- and
over-privileges are treated in a uniform fashion.  Perhaps that's not
what POSIX intended, but I don't think "not what was intended" is a
sufficient reason for backing away from something that might be
useful.  Do you have a specific problem in mind?
However, the suggestion makes sense: if I can't convince the Powers
That Be that implementing under-privileges with capabilities is a Good
Thing (and I can see that it will be a serious problem), I'll try the
LSM approach.
