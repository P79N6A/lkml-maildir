Hello,
I experienced problems in programs which used priorities under FIFO-Scheduling 
with Kernel 2.2 although these programs worked well with Kernel 2.0. 
I read in this list that other people had the same problems.
Is any solution (a newer kernel version or a special patch) available for that
problem?
Christoph
