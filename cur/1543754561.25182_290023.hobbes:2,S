This one is going away very soon, including the whole old-style
->follow_link support - for technical reasons.
Please convert your driver to put the contents of the symlink into
... and implement ->put_link like all intree filesystems already did.
Without that we can't bump the limit on recursive symlinks, a feature
that IBM has been pushing for very hard, btw..
