BIOS'es and firmware are not drivers or normal "processes". Firmware
doesn't deal with the internal kernel's locking for example- is a very
different thing. bios and firmware is pretty much part of the hardware,
pretty much like the chips' internal design: it just "does its work".
There's no of point on having open source bioses/firmware if you don't
have the design docs and all the related hardware info aswell.
(IOW: Saying that you'are using "propietary software" because you're
using a propietary BIOS is wrong, IMO - it's pretty much "propietary 
hardware" even if its software)
