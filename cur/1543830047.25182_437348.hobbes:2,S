Subject: [Suspend2][ 09/16] [Suspend2] Top level routine for do_suspend.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/26/423

Our top level routine for suspending - activate storage, check if we can
suspend, check if a kept image is still to be used (powerdown if so), then
prepare and save the image (including powering down). When we return from
save_image, we've either aborted during saving, or resumed at a later time.
