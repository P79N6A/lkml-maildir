Subject: [PATCH]Fix menuconfig error message
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

If you try to run `make menuconfig' on a system that lacks ncurses
development libs, you get an error message telling you to install
ncurses-devel. Some popular distributions don't have an ncurses-devel
package. This patch generalizes the error message. Patch is against
2.6.12.
MAINTAINERS doesn't list a maintainer for menuconfig or lxdialog,
so I sent this to lkml, kbuild-devel, and to the kconfig maintainer.
