Subject: maximum block size in buffer_head

The current Linux kernel (both 2.4.xx and 2.5.xx) declare the b_size
member in struct buffer_head as an "unsigned short".  This obviously
limits the maximum block size to something less than 65536.  This is
bad because on some platforms (e.g., ia64), the page size can be up to
64KB large.
Two questions:
 - does anyone object to widening b_size to "unsigned int"?
 - does anyone know of any other code paths where the block
   size is assumed to fit into 16 bits?
Thanks,
