Unfortunately modpost does not alows know how to resolve symbol names
from addresses. Lately it has been improves by adding support for 
addends in ELF. But that is beyond my ELF knowledge atm so
I cannot improve it.
What you can do (apart from the cscope trick as Randy suggest) is
to run modpost manual on all .o files in drivers/
If the cross reference happens in a single .o file you will get
a hit there.
And if it is say in scsi then you will get a hit in scsi/built-in.o
Hope this helps.
