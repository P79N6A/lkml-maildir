Hi, I tried the latest  V-5.0 patch over 2.6.8.1 in these conditions with the
actual server subsystem, and I get components timeouts :(
I also ran the watchdog script on the box while running the test, and saw
deltas of around 3 seconds every few hours:

Could I do something more useful than just displaying those deltas? Maybe I
could dump the process list in some way, or enable some debugging code in the
kernel to find out what is going on?
Thanks
Nicolas
