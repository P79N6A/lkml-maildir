After a quick look on the need of stats tracers, it looks like it is often
needed to have several stat modes/files for a single tracer.
The current tracing stat API doesn't support more than one stat file per tracer.
The first patch makes the tracing/stat Api reentrant and let a tracer able
implement more than one stat file.
The second one adapts this Api to the branch tracer.
