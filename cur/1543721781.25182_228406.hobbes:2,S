If the kernel is not configured, there is nothing you can do. You cannot 
automatically configure the kernel and hope it matches the running kernel.
Simply use the standard methods to build an external module and any decent 
distribution should make sure these work and AFAICS SuSE did exactly that.

Wrong, there is no automatic way to build an external that takes care of 
all possible problems and there never will be.

No, there will be serious problems if module authors use undocumented
features and demand for them to work forever.
