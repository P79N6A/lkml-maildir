So you are saying: 'If it's a dasd function, do it in the dasd 
driver!'. Right? 
Well, I can understand that point. As the invocation of the new 
ioctls is actually changing the behavior of a dasd device, I'm
looking into moving that part from dasd_eer into the main dasd module. 
Since this will remove the dynamic ioctl registration as well, it
will also remove the conflict with your cleanup code.

Hm, you suggested sysfs in a previous mail. Once I have moved
the eerset/eerget logic into the main dasd driver, I could provide
a sysfs interface instead of the ioctls (right now that would be
difficult).
But I'd like to know why an ioctl is so bad. I know that the ioctl
interface as such can be error prone, but in our case we just 
transfer an integer back and forth. Sysfs always struck me as an
end user interface, something that a human can use with echo and 
cat instead of specialized tools. The new ioctls however should not
be used directly, but by a tool or daemon that knows what it does
and can handle the changed behavior of the dasd device. 
Until now we have always implemented functionality like that as
ioctls (e.g. quiesce/resume, reserve/release) so the new ioctls are
more consistent with the existing interface, and I'd like to keep it
that way.

As I said, the dynamic ioctls can be removed from my code.
(I don't want to dwell on it, but your first NACK against dasd_eer
was because it added code to compat_ioctl.c. I wasn't aware of your
discussion with Martin about the dynamic ioctls.)

Well, the dasd ioctl will be moved so the misc device will be the
only interface implemented by dasd_eer.

As said above, I still prefer the ioctls over a sysfs interface.
Since the other issues do not cause interface changes I would 
prefer to keep the code in.
