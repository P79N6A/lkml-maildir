Or
linux-2.6.19 + testing/patch-2.6.20-rc1 = linux-2.6.20-rc1
linux-2.6.20-rc1 + testing/incr/patch-2.6.20-rc1-rc2 = linux-2.6.20-rc2
linux-2.6.20-rc2 + testing/incr/patch-2.6.20-rc2-rc3 = linux-2.6.20-rc3
and so on.

Or this. Or use git as was suggested by others, to track kernel changes
in a finer-grained manner. Or try the -mm patchset which has --- how
shall I call it --- pre-release code. Or track some subsystem-specific
or architecture-specific development trees if you are especially
interested in a platform or driver subsystem. See the MAINTAINERS file
for their development repositories. These repos do not always carry
self-contained source trees though, and what purposes they serve for the
maintainers and how they can be used by others than the maintainers
differs from repo to repo.
