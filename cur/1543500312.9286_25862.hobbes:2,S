Since not just Linus's copyright will be violated ? Still he is primary
copyright holder...

This is correct. But if they'll give source to ONE customer it'll be uploaded
on ftp immediately :-)) So there are no reasons for then to do it this way.
Of course they can ask every customer to sign NDA but I doubt this will work
and will not frighten away buyers. They CAN NOT ask to sign NDA only after
request for source: if you gave me binaries you must give me sources as well.
Without additional restrictions (see 
http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html
).
So yes, it looks like good chance to test GPL in court. But IMO Linus (or
someone else from top developers) must firstly gently contact with them on
subject. Now about Linux in iToaster. On official iToaster page
(
http://Microworkz.com/Products/iToaster/iToaster.cfm
) there are no word
"Linux" but there are three links at the bottom:

All three articles claims that there are used mix of Linux and BeOS.

This is for the beginning, of course. It's REALLY important check of GPL and
we must be ready to go as far as in court :-/ But first thing to do is to
ask them gently about Linux, GPL, iToaster and OS sources... And this is duty
of Linus I afraid (even he hate such stuff as we all know). Even if Microworks
violated copyright of few tens different persons at least with Linux usage...
