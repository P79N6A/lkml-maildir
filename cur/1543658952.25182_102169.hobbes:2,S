While writing als4000.c (SB16++ on PCI), I was using sb_mixer.c
[now... don't laugh].  I found what I think is a silly.
When building the recmask, the code loops from zero to
SOUND_MIXER_NRDEVICES, building up a bitmask to then write to the card.
Due to what I feel is an obvious scoping error, the present[buggy] code
writes the left and right recmask SOUND_MIXER_NRDEVICES times!  And with
an ever-changing bitmask, too...
Since the bitmask is eventually correct, this code works, but is really
stupid.  This patch corrects the scoping error.  Completely untested.
