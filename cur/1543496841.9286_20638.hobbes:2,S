Hi Stephen,
I picked up your fsync patches, and there is a variety of likely minor
difficulties.  
First what's the difference between 
fsynv-2.2.6-v2
fsynv-2.2.6-v1
With v2 and also v1 there is still a variety of things not quite working
out, among others:
- the type of fsync in file_operations in fs.h doesn't have the datasync
parm.
- block_fsync and file_fsync have the wrong type in fs.h 
- struct buffer_head is not yet correctly defined in the patch.
At that point I gave up -- what do you recommend?
