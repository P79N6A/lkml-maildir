It's not used by default, but there are cases where it's used and it
would be a shame to release a major kernel and knowingly break
them. For example, any setup that used iommu_force or any non-AMD
x86-64 machine with more than 4GB of memory and only 32-bit capable
DMA devices.

I don't have an IA64 machine, but if the NODE(0) fix is safe there, I
vote for it for 2.6.14-rc4. Another alternative is to temporarily
provide a different version of swiotlb_init() for x86-64 and IA64 -
I can whip up a patch if that's acceptable.
Cheers,
