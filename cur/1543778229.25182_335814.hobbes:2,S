Want to increase the latest kernel "speed" by 5 times ? Use the 
follwoing code instead. :)
// -- Start Code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
int main()
{
clock_t initialTime;
clock_t testTime;
long counter = 0;
double test = 1;
initialTime = clock() / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
testTime = initialTime;
printf("Here we go...\n");
while((testTime-initialTime) < 30)
{
testTime = clock()/CLOCKS_PER_SEC;
test /= 10;
test *= 10;
test += 10;
test -= 10;
counter ++;
}
printf("No. of cycles: %ld\n", counter);
return 0;
}
// ---- End code
so essentially you are timing just the time() function.
HTH,
