This assumes that 'needed' functions are close together.
This can be easily not the case, so you end up using only
a fraction of fetched page's content.
Also this argument tend to defend library growth.
"It's mostly unused, don't worry". What if that
is not true? How to compare RAM footprint
of new versus old lib in this case?
Just believe that it didn't get worse?
This can't be checked easily:
even -static compile can fail to help.
glibc produce nearly 400kb executable for
int main() { return 0; }
because init code uses printf on error paths and
that pulls i18n in. How many kilobytes is really
runs - who knows...
