Dear Andrew, dear developers!
Since 2.6.12-rc1-mmX I cannot get suspend2ram working again as it was
with 2.6.11-mm4 with the same .config.
I suspends fine, but never resumes. No CapsLock, no sysrq, no network is
working. Nothing in the log files. Is there anything which may cause
these troubles when compiled into the kernel and not loaded as module?
(as it was with my usb stuff until 2.6.11-mm2, after this I had to stop
hotplug, before I could go with usb running).
On a side node: Once suspend2ram couldn't stop all tasks, in fact
cpufreq, although it was stopped with /etc/init.d/cpufreqd stop, was
mentioned in syslog as not being able to be stopped, and after this
halfway through suspend, my touchpad (synaptics) and kbd wasn't working
anymore.  After resume the touchpad is somehow behaving strange.
THe touchpad is not working at all, the keyboard seems to react to some
events (Sysrq is working, but normal typing not, nor power button/acpi
stuff).
In the syslog I find:
vmunix: psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 4 bytes away.
vmunix: psmouse.c: TouchPad at isa0060/serio1/input0 lot sync at byte 1
I would be happy to test some stuff to get S2R back to work!
Thanks a lot and all the best
Norbert
