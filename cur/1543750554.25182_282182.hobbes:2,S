Yes. Although I've not actually tested it.
Before, it used to show up as one event, and basically the "0x80" marker 
got lost, so effectively the "system call exit" part would have got lost. 
Now, it _may_ DTRT, with the caveat that the system call ptrace_notify() 
thing still has the same problem with restarting-with-a-signal.
That's basically a "don't do that then", and is the status quo, of course,
so this is at least not a regression. It's still pretty ugly, but 
apparently nobody really cares ;)
