One of the "technical reasons" was if the function was bigger than some
threshold.  And in that case I think it is ok to speak about inline keyword
as a hint.  The default inline limit (in rtx count after constant folding,
but not other optimizations) was bigger than in the GCC 3.x era, sure, but
there was a limit and GCC wasn't inlining functions bigger than that limit,
even if they could be simplified due to constant arguments to something
much smaller.
