If this were a common case where many pages end up, yes, we'd
need a separate special list; but it's a very rare case, so I
think it's more appropriate to let shrink_cache do it when it
eventually reaches them on the inactive_list.
I was proposing we revert to distinguishing page_cache_release
from put_page, page_cache_release doing the lru_cache_del; and
I'd like to add my in_interrupt() BUG() there for now, just as
a sanity check.  You are proposing that we keep the current,
post-Ben, structure of doing it in __free_pages_ok if possible.
I think I prefer mine, in_interrupt() as a sanity check which
could be removed when we feel safer, to yours where it's
deciding the behaviour of __free_pages_ok.  Any strong feelings?
