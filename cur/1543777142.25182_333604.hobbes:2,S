BTW, what's the difference between rw_semaphore and compat_rw_semaphore?  
Or between semaphore and compat_semaphore?  I ran into a similar issue
(needing compat_semaphore) with the IVTV drivers.  The following is a
portion of my patch to get IVTV running under RT (the other portions are
just compile-time semantics):
