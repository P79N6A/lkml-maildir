As first you must understand if the memory is allocated in userspace or
not. A ps xam should tell you if there is one of your proggy that is
eating memory continously.
If it's not an userspace issue grab my latest ikd-patch at:
	
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/andrea/kernel/ikd/2.2.7-ikd1.bz2
apply it, to a clean 2.2.7, enable the memleak detector, reboot and read
the docs in scripts/memleak or similar. Then run the script to get the
/proc/memleak info and you should discover which bit of kernel is leaking
memory. CC to me when if you'll get such information.
