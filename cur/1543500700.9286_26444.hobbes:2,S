Ingo, stop this. You're not making sense.

What's wrong with that?
It makes _perfect_ sense. It makes a whole lot more sense than any of the
alternatives I've seen. It makes two very distinct tests:
 - if the mapping does not exist, we create one. If the create fails, we
   exit. Clear as a bell, it's obviously correct.
After the above step, we're guaranteed to have a mapping. HOLES DO NOT
EVEN ENTER THE PICTURE ANY MORE! If a filesystem still has a hole by the
time we've required the mapping, that filesystem is obviously broken and
buggy. Nothing subtle about it at all.
 - if it's not up-to-date, and we're only going to write a partial buffer,
   we need to mark it up-to-date. There are two cases for that: either the
   buffer was marked "newly created" or it needs to be read in. Again,
   clear as a bell, and obviously correct.
In short: two very simple rules, both of them very obvious indeed.

"obviously fail" HOW?
The rules are very simple. And HOLE has nothing to do with it. Your hole
defines just made it more complex, imho.
