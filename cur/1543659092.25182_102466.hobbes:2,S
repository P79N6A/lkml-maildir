Microsoft doesn't use Verisign for its driver signing -- it's a proprietary 
system that is hard-wired into Windows.  I would guess you are confusing 
SSL certificates with module signatures.
As for "whois" you will find the default host for the GNU version is 
"whois.crsnic.net", which is not Verisign.
Microsoft signs modules that passes their test suite, and for which vendors 
pay a pretty penny (five digits' worth in US Dollars, if I recall 
correctly).  There is no comparable central authority for Linux or GNU 
software, nor would vendors be interested in spending the kind of dollars 
that would be associated with that sort of certification.  If they would, I 
would LOVE to start such a business.
