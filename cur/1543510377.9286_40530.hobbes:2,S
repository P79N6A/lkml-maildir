This is indeed, at least partially, the case here.  We export /,
under which other partitions are mounted, but then the client makes a
separate mount to access anything on any of these partitions.  One
mount per partition.  I suppose we could have overlooked how the
client is accessing files, as it is certainly possible for the client
to access another partition through the main mount via a complicated
path, but I think it unlikely.  So I guess either this has in fact
occurred, or the separate mount made by the client doesn't affect the
problem.  
For clarity, here is a representative piece of our setup 
(all machines running autofs):
server:
/dev/sda1 /
/dev/sda2 /fix/b
/dev/sda3 /fix/c
/mnt/r -> /
/mnt/b -> /fix/b
/mnt/c -> /fix/c
client:
/mnt/server/r    server:/mnt/r
/mnt/server/b    server:/mnt/b
/mnt/server/c    server:/mnt/c
Files under /dev/sda2 are accessed by the client under /mnt/server/b,
not /mnt/server/r/fix/b.  Should this setup be stable?  If not, is
there anything else I can do to arrange these mounts in a maximally
stable way under 2.2.12?
