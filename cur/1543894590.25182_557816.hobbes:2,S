It's not, it's a personal comment from a misunderstanding of the GPL text. 
It's as valid as the "closed source kernel modules are legal" comment that 
was there some years ago.

It's there in section 9.

??? Linus changed his own less permissive license (which 
excluded "commercial use", and certainly the TiVO device is commercial) in 
0.0x time-frame. He added and deleted comments on top of COPYING in later 
years, some simply wrong like the assertion on proprietary kernel modules. 
He added his interpretation about the version issue in 2.4.0-test9, and he 
may delete it any time he wants. It's *his* interpretation.

COPYING says in section 9 that there may be other versions, and if you as 
author don't specify the version, it's "any version".

Yo, then fucking do it! Write it in the files you contribute! If you don't, 
you haven't! You decide, not Linus Torvalds. Make it clear you have 
decided.

Wrong.

It's a personal comment from Linus, and not clear in any way. Do it the way 
the file COPYING itself suggests. It's not "idiotic", it's the most obvious 
way to do it.
