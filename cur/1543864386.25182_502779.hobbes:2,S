The CPU_DOWN would need to set work.func == NULL for this to work. But 
then the slab does not shut down the work queues for the processor. Isnt 
this another issue with workqueues? The slab would need a notification 
that the workqueue for a processor was shutdown in order to set work.func 
= NULL.

Uhh.... This may not be correct in terms of how the slab operates.

Well seems that we have a set of unresolved issues with workqueues and cpu 
hotplug.
