Of course this is going to remove all the routes, since without eth0
they're useless.  That's obvious behavior.
The problem is when you have to remove a route with route(8) in order to
do other tricks:
[root@psi omega]# route -n

*This*, IMHO, is broken.  I've been playing with host-routing chains to do
ad-hoc wireless (10.1.7.x is WaveLAN), and it's a pain to have to delete 2
or even 3 routes to the same place before I can get rid of the network
route entirely.  If we *must* have an automagically generated route show
up when you ifconfnig an interface (which I also think is broken), then at
the very least removing a route would remove all duplicate copies of it.
IMO, route(8) adding an identical route to something that already exists
is a bit broken too...
Haven't seen the right code, so I'm unsure if this is a kernel problem
(auto-adding of routes appears to be) or a net-tools issue, so I'm sending
this to both the kernel list (where it came from) and linux-net.
