you are right. Fortunately the main use of cond_resched_softirq() is via
cond_resched_all() - which is safe because it uses softirq_count(). But
the kernel/timer.c explicit call to cond_resched_softirq() is unsafe.
I've fixed this in my tree and i've added an assert to catch the
underflow when it happens.
