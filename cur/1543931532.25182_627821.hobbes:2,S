Perhaps we should ask the -mm folks if they happen to have an idea what
caused it ...
Background: we're seeing pages allocated in reverse order after boot.
This causes IO performance problems on machines without IOMMUs as we
can't merge pages when they're allocated in the wrong order.  This is
something that went wrong between 2.6.23 and 2.6.24-rc5.
Bill Irwin had a patch that fixed this; it was merged months ago, but
the effects of it seem to have been undone.
