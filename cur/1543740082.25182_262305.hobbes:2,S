Register corruption makes strange unrelated errors. The problem
shown is related to semaphores. Most every time any I/O is
performed to a shared device, a semaphore is used to obtain
temporary exclusive use of the device. If the semaphore code
is spilling registers, which it can with recent 'C' compilers,
the result can be random corruption.
You should just patch the kernel with the patch I provided.
It will even patch 2.4.x code because semaphore.c hasn't been
changed very often.
If the corruption goes away, you've either fixed the problem
or have changed the size of something so that something that
was getting trashed before by some completely-unrelated code,
is now able to survive.
Without some specific OOPS, some code to trace, it's just
a crap game. But, the semaphore patch can't hurt anything.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
