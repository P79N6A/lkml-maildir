No, this brick as a building block :)

It uses single port, configurable at mount time.
POHMELFS client can connect to different addresses (including ipv6) and
via different protocols (like sctp). Metadata server will provide that
information dynamically, so pohmelfs client will be able to connect to
different nodes and perform operations in parallell.

Who will be online first. Second node will be told that there is a
merge collision and it has to be resolved by hands.

Well, at least it has some very interesting ideas.
Although there are things which are not that good imho, time will
show, maybe there will be another state-of-the-art filesystem at the
moment...
This was for information.

First, clients work with local caches and sync them either in writeback
or via cache coherency algorithm. This work is effectively parallel.
Second, pohmelfs as in distributed filesystem is developed as a transport
layer to eliminate mount operation for each different node, so that
after client asks for data it would be just sent to different server.
This allows to make parallel transactions. Essentially it looks like
mounting different remote server to virtual directory working with it,
except that connection setup should be done not at mount time, but at
run time.
