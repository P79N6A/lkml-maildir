As far as the VFS goes, this is only in the fs-dependent part of the
inode.  The practical effect is the same.
What I'd like to add is: while we're at it, how about losing the 512
byte magic multiplier and go with the filesystem block size?  That way
Ext2 file size automatically goes up by a factor of 8 every time we
manage to double the filesystem block size (blocksize*2 and triple
indirect => 2**3).
