Hi,
I have an oops report for a usb problem. Is this the correct list to 
post it to.
I want to post the ksymoops decoded opps, together with a copy of the 
module's source code in which the oops happened, together with the 
module.o file, thinking that with all that, it should help the developer 
of that module cure the problem.
The source file where the oops happens is 
./linux-2.4.21/drivers/usb/host/uhci.c
I cannot see any kernel mailing list dedicated to usb, so that is why I 
am asking before posting what might be a largish post of linux-kernel.
Cheers
James
