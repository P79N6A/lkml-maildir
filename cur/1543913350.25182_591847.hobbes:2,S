Thanks for the great suggestions guys. The only useful DMI information
the manufacturer has encoded [1], is the base board model name
('Crestline' here). This feels too generic to use, but the combination
of no vendor name and the 'Crestline' model name may be specific
enough, perhaps?
I do agree with Mark that there should be some override, for normal
PATA ports (as opposed to on-mobo sockets), since the user chooses the
cable. Perhaps we need a port mask in the DMI whitelist too, and a
port-general/specific override mechanism?
