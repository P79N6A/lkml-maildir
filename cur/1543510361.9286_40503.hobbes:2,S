Subject: Problem with exports and "access" option on RedHat 6

	I have some backup scripts that NFS mount a system then backup the
files over the network.  When we upgraded to RedHat 6, the default behavior
seems to be "noaccess".  The docs indicate that "access" is the default
but it bahaves differently.  If I mount "/", I can go to any of the other
partitions without mounting them as well.  I used to be able to do that.
	Is there a patch available to restore the "access" as the default
or will a "access" flag work in /etc/exports?
