Cool, that's what I figured when looking at cipsov4.
As for the namespace term(yeah I don't know the term; ahh different
domain's or mappings I think);
Anyways heres what I'm trying to achieve:
default looks like this:
Configured NetLabel domain mappings(1)
domain: DEFAULT
    protocol: UNLABELED
I want to try and have three of these for the
different types of media:
(in theory)
Configured NetLabel domain mappings(3)
domain:radio
   protocol: UNLABELED
domain:T.V.
   protocol: UNLABELED
domain:web
   protocol: UNLABELED
(and if possible three different tags(either 1,2,5), but probably can
only do that with cipsov4);
heres what I've come up with so far:
netlabelctl -p map del default
netlabelctl unlbl add domain:radio interface:wlan0 address:<myadd> 
label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_t:s0
netlabelctl unlbl add domain:radio interface:wlan0 address:<radioadd> 
label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_t:s0
netlabelctl unlbl add domain:T.V. interface:wlan0 address:<myadd> 
label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_t:s0
netlabelctl unlbl add domain:T.V. interface:wlan0 address:<t.v.add> 
label:system_u:object_r:netlabel_peer_t:s0
As for the new capabilities, I don't mind trying that out when
the time comes(but first I need to figure the this out before any other 
ways);
here is what the error looks like:
netlabel_tools-0.19# make
INFO: creating the version header file
.: 10: version_info: not found
make: *** [include/version.h] Error 2
(googling for the missing package results in a bunch of
hits on "just do a uname -r");
In any case using the default, and then just adding
addresses is probably fine for the time being.
