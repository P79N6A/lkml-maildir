I was not able to reproduce this failure.  Those symbols should be defined
by arch/x86/vdso/vdso-syms.lds, a file generated by the build.  If that
file is empty in your build, remove it and see if it gets regenerated
properly, or try a clean build.  If the problem persists, please send me
your complete .config file.
Thanks,
Roland
