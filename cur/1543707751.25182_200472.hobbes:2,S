I don't have apic built in the kernel.  This has only started to 
happen on 2.6.3.  As I said, on all other kernels, 2.4.x, 2.6.0, 
2.6.1, 2.6.2 these NIC are OK.
With 2.6.3 my logs are now riddled with these messages (and the 
period is totally random - sometimes 10 times in an hour), and I lose 
connectivity during these periods.
I will be booting back into 2.6.2 tonight until I can resolve this.
