Ok, this one works, I agree... But it will be way slower than coda's
file-backed approach, right?

Hmmm, so if userspace part is swapped out and data is dirtied
"too quickly", OOM is practically guaranteed? That is not nice.
What if userspave daemon is not fast enough to handle writes (going
through slow network or something), is there some mechanksm to
throttle back the writer, or will it just OOM?
