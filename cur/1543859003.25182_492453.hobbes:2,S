i've noticed this sort of thing before -- submenus containing entries
that don't actually depend on the top-level config variable.  but
which drivers are you talking about here?  i'm looking at the
ieee1394/Kconfig file and every entry in that submenu appears to
depend explicitly on IEEE1394.
note that that patch i submitted earlier didn't try to modify every
single sub-entry under Device Drivers -- only those for which it
seemed that the transformation wouldn't cause *any* change in
functionality.  so if there was something about ieee1394 that didn't
fit the bill, it's because i must have overlooked something.
in any event, as i mentioned earlier, i'm just trying to find a way to
make the menu entries more obvious and more easily selectable, without
having to enter each submenu to see what it represents.  it's quite
possible that a whole new kbuild directive would be useful here.  who
knows?
