sys_epoll, by plugging directly in the existing kernel architecture,
supports sockets and pipes. It does not support and there're not even
plans to support other devices like tty, where poll() and select() works
flawlessy. Since the sys_epoll ( and /dev/epoll ) fd support standard polling, you
can mix sys_epoll handling with other methods like poll() and the AIO's
POLL function when it'll be ready. For example, for devices that sys_epoll
intentionally does not support, you can use a method like :
        put_sys_epoll_fd_inside_XXX();
        ...
        wait_for_XXX_events();
        ...
        if (XXX_event_fd() == sys_epoll_fd) {
                sys_epoll_wait();
                for_each_sys_epoll_event {
                        handle_fd_event();
                }
        }
