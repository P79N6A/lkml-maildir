Well, as you point out, BeOS is not a hard realtime system, however
the fact that the filesystem, block cache, drivers, etc are all
preemptable means you can get some pretty decent response.  Interrupt
response from timers or IO interrupts in the 30-60us range is certainly
doable.  It'd be neat to actually put together some benchmarks to 
compare this sort of thing.
Networking on BeOS is not stellar, but it's servicable and performance
issues are being worked on.  Raw disk IO is actually pretty good, to my 
knowledge, though obviously real numbers are what you want here and
I don't have 'em offhand.  Dominic's book on BFS does talk a bit
about that.
Again we're not hard-realtime and we don't cure the common cold.
