Subject: invalidate inode given block?

Is there a simple way of telling a file system that it needs to revise
its opinion about an inode? I plan to sneak a change underneath on
disk, find the inode it belongs to, and invalidate it.
Is that possible? I've been looking around  fs/block_dev.c and it seems
to do related stuff, but I'm hoping someone can short circuit my
reading experience.
