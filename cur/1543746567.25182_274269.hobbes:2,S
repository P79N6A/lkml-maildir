Ok,
	Do you see anything missing (from an implementation point of view) 
for the following?
Suspend:
	1) suspend all cpus, save cpu0
	2) proceed with state saving on cpu0 only
	3) begin suspend
Resume:
	1) begin resume
	2) offline all currently online cpus
	3) proceed with state restoring
	4) online all previously online cpus
A lot of the subsystems which have work split across cpus will now have 
work migrated across to cpu0, in that regard, which have you made swsusp 
savvy? It looks like the timer changes might need looking at any others?
Thanks,
	Zwane
