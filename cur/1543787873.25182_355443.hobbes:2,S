I'm fully aware of that; not that it matters much for folk who aren't
building and deploying systems with PREEMPT_RT.

The rationale is simple:  you're trying to force one implementation
strategy.  Needlessly forcing one strategy, even when others may be
better (I already gave three examples), is a bad idea.  QED.  :)

I just described them that way; yes.  They're not layer hopping though;
they preserve the distinctions in roles and responsibilities which help
keep components from interfering with each other.
One general point is that when hardware doesn't support autoconfiguration,
something out-of-band is required to plug that hole.  In this case,
those tables can be segmented to handle SPI devices on both mainboards
and add-on boards.  Ditto for SPI controllers, but that mostly matters
for developer tools like parport adapters.
