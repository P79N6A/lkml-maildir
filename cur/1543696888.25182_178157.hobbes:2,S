We are currently fighting with a problem with the USB HID API, which
seems to prevent a user space application to write more than 32 bit
into a HID field.
We think that this problem can be solved with one of two little
changes to /drivers/usb/hid-core.c (2.4.22 tree):
Function hid_register_field at usb-core.c:96:
  static struct hid_field *hid_register_field(struct hid_report *report, unsigned usages, unsigned values)
The function either needs to duplicate the struct hid_usage or grow
the size of the last struct hid_usage. The first option is the
easiest since it does not require a change of hiddev API. The later
option is probably more effective but requires to change the
HIDIOCSUSAGE ioctl so that it accepts a struct {void* data, int
data_size} instead of just int data. 
I would be happy to submit a patch, but would like to hear first
which option is favourable. The first costs performance and memory,
the second an API change.
Or is there a specific reason why only 32 bits are writeable?
Thanks,
