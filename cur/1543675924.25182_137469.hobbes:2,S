Hi!
I saw a problem with the keyboard and I want to tell my story.
Motherboards are EPOX with an Nvidia TNT2 card.
2 computers - not the same hard configuration.
From time to time the keyboard goes crazy: I press A it gives me z, I
press ENTER it gives me n and so on.
After a while or with a reset, the problem is gone.
What can this be?
Thanks!
