Hi gurus,
	this file does not compile.
I've probably found the solution but i'm totally not an expert and
nearly to able
to submit a normal patch... sorry...
in the function ov511_read_proc the line
out += sprintf (out, "driver_version  : %s\n", version);
report an error because version is not defined.
I've tryed in this way:
out += sprintf (out, "driver_version  : %s\n", DRIVER_VERSION);
this compile and seems to work....
Regards
Fabio
