My first thought was 'slab poison', but you don't have slab debugging turned on.
Randy's followup to my patch: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/5/15
had another trick that may be useful. It'll slow down printk's
to a point where you might be able to see what happened.
another trick may be to just add a for (;;) into the BUG macro.

Hmm, you had hit bad_page(), so that may be a more useful place
to add a pause.
