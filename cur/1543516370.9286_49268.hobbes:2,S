First, the load balancing should be smart enough to distribute the load
somewhat more sensibly and not hit a single server full rate.
If it actually does that, you may want to consult the Linux Virtual Server
Project at 
http://www.LinuxVirtualServer.org/
 and replace your not-functional
hardware with a mucho superior Linux implementation - but I may be biased here
;)
Otherwise, what you are describing is a well known problem with the way Apache
listens for new requests and is being addressed. You are right that it
requires support from the kernel and Apache at the same time though.
