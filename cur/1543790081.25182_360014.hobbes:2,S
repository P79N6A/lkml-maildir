Ok, update and good news: it did actually copy the files properly, reading and 
checking worked without errors.

Good guess and damn, yes, I've got the Icy Box IB-351-UE which has the 
prolific chipset, I guess it's the (cursed) PL3507. [The IcyBox FAQ says: 
IB-350/351/360UE Prolific (PL3507) - Agere (FW8028)] 
However, I've read that they had problems in 2004 and that all new devices 
(starting from October 2004) have the updated firmware already. 
I have also found some of your posts from 2004 on lkml about the prolific 
chipset, actually anything I found is mostly from 2004 :-/
So sorry for the dumb question, but do I check if I've got the newest firmware 
without windows? I had a look at www.icybox.de but found no firmware for 
ib-351, only for ib-350 and that one is from Dec 2004.
And even if I've got the newest firmware already, does the prolific stuff work 
by now or should I chuck it out the window?

Yes, which makes the thing at least usable now :-) But it still takes forever 
since it happens every 30-120 seconds. And just now the HD started making 
*really* strange noises after I let it sit there idle for 10-20 minutes or 
so. The I quickly read some files and it stopped. I'm scared of my data...
Thanks for your help,
