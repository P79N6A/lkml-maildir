> So how much memory is mlocked?
In the 3.5G case, we lock 4 blocks (4 * 427683520 bytes, or 1.631M). 
There is code in the kernel that prevents more than 1/2 of all physical 
pages from being mlocked:
mlock.c:215-218: (in do_mlock)
	/* we may lock at most half of physical memory... */
	/* (this check is pretty bogus, but doesn't hurt) */
	if (locked > num_physpages/2)
		goto out;
For 2.2 we were have a patch that increases this to 90% or 60M, but we 
don't use this patch on 2.4 yet.

Latency. We know exactly what data should remain in memory, so we're 
trying to prevent the vm from paging out the wrong data. It makes a huge 
difference in performance.
