It has indeed. I do fail to see why that was necessary though...
IMHO, it would have been more elegant to use the typeof construct provided 
by gcc in the new macro instead of introducing a type parameter like this...
#define min(x,y) \
         ({ typeof(x) __x = (x); typeof(y) __y = (y); __x < __y ? __x: __y; })
Best regards,
