 Hi,
 Please apply.
 Dmitry Torokhov has been criticizing my code for some days (Thanks Dmitry),
 and here is the result. It should be ready for -mm tree.
 Simon Kelly tested the patch series and reported improvement with some
 problems he was having.

 Each patch starts with a changelog, but I'll write a full changelog
 here for the casual reader:
 - 01_request_firmware-misc-fix.diff
	- use vfree to free vmalloc memory.
	- Make sure fw_setup_class_device sets *class_dev_p to NULL in
	  all case of error.
	- Fix error handling in firmware_class_init.
 - 02_request_firmware-misc-polish.diff
	- Take advantage of strlcpy.
	- Extra error logging.
	- Use struct coping instead of memcpy.
	- Put all aborting code in a single place, and fully abort if
	  fw_realloc_buffer fails.
	- Abort on unexpected 'loading' values.
 - 03_request_firmware-state-tracking.diff
	- Make an status bitmap instead of using independent boolean
	  variables.  It will make things nicer later when new issues
	  need to be tracked.
 - 04_request_firmware-propper-release-1.diff
	- release 'struct firmware_priv' from class_dev->release.
 - 05_request_firmware-propper-release-2.diff
	- Remove races related to the handling and release of 'struct
	  firmware'
 - 06_request_firmware-rearrange.diff
	- Refactor fw_setup_class_device for readability and
	  maintainability.
 - 07_request_firmware-dont-remove-attr.diff
	- Don't remove attributes, they should be gone automatically.
 
 Have a nice day
 	Manuel
