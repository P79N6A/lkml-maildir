can you explain what was changed by CKRM there? Did you made it to 
control ASYNC read/writes? I don't think so...
Do you have any plots on what is concurrent bandwidth is depending on 
weights? Because, our measurements show that CFQ is not ideal and 
behaves poorly when prio 0,5,6,7 are used :/ Only 1,2,3,4 are really 
linear-scalable...

they provide also vmpages guarantees and guarantees against OOM killer. 
(vmguarpages and oomguarpages) i.e. if container consumes less than X 
pages it won't be killed by OOM killer. Only if there no any other 
container to select. I.e. we have 2-level OOM.
