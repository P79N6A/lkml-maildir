The process's root and cwd vfsmounts are used permanently, but
this last_vfsmount passed via task_struct behaves like temporary variable
pushed on stack memory.
In other words, last_vfsmount becomes NULL when it becomes invalid.

| 	struct vfsmount *prev_mnt = task->last_vfsmount;
| 	task->last_vfsmount = mntget(mnt);
| 	ret = vfs_create(dir, dentry, mode, nd);
| 	task->last_vfsmount = prev_mnt;
| 	mntput(mnt);
| 	return ret;
| }
I agree that keeping last_vfsmount after it lost it's reference count is bad, but
I don't understand why keeping last_vfsmount while it has it's reference count is bad too.
Regards.
