Exactly. I'd rather work towards that than end up with two incompatible
ways of handling capabilities. Besides, I find your idea cute, but the
placement of capabilities means kernel hair that will have to be shaven
later, and AFAIU that is a no-no with Linus (quite my idea too, BTW). It
will also give strange interactions with "true" capabilities (as you call
them) later on.

An independent patch for people that want to fool around with capabilities
and get the hang of them perhaps, but not part (even as "experiment") of an
official (even experimental) kernel release. And in that case the security
implications are (almost) moot anyway.
Just MVHO.
