Don't mix allocation with initialization.
Well, lets see:
  struct xxx {
    struct yyy* y;
    int z;
  }
  
  xxx_init(struct xxx* x)
  {
     z = 0;
     y = kmalloc(GPF_KERNEL,sizeof(struct yyy));
     yyy_init(y);
  }
Now, if on other source file you read:
  ...
  struct xxx* x;
  x = kmallloc(GPF_KERNEL,sizeof(struct xxx));
  xxx_init(x);
  ..
  struct xxx  x2;
  xxx_init(&x2);
How do you know what xxx_init() does without looking at it ?
Cay you have just the allocation without init ? What happens if you forget it ?
What happens if you cut'n'paste from other driver and let something like
  struct xxx* x;
  x = kmallloc(GPF_KERNEL,sizeof(struct qqqqq));
  xxx_init(x);
The only difference it that
  x = new(GPF_KERNEL) XXX;
always does what it has to do correctly. What does XXX() constructor ?
You have to look at it, same as xxx_init().
As I said in other answer: I'm not advocating to include C++ support in
current kernel. I just say that the only valid argument is that
'KERNEL IS C', and interfacing C with C++ just would add bloat and errors.
There is no technical argument to reject to write an OS kernel in C++.
It would not be slower nor more complicated, and it will be probably safer
because it leaves less things (from thost you always _must_ do) to
programmers memories.
