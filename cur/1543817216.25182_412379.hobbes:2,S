Haven't looked at this in details, but two small comments already:
 - generic_file_splice_read/write should probably go to filemap.c
   where all the other generic pagecache file operations are
 - could we try to replace ->sendfile and ->sendfile with the splice
   operations completely?  Having two different sets of zero-copy
   file to file transfer mechanisms will make the code pretty messy.
