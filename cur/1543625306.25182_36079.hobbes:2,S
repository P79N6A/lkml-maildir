Well.  We have several places in the I/O path already where we need to
allocate memory in order to fulfill an I/O.  
Think RAID1 where you need to turn one request from the filesystem
into several - one for each mirror.  Or RAID5 where a write may cause
several reads/writes so you can mask and write the checksum out.
Also, with journaling filesystems you may very well be in a situation
where pushing a file to disk involves writing transactions to the log
before you can actually free up buffers.
In this case the clones come from the bio slab cache and are thus no
different from any other I/Os.  Furthermore, the clones share the bulk
of their data with the parent, so the overhead isn't that big.
