I believe it is 20 years from filing date or 17 years from issue date
whichever is later (and with the stuff needed to get a patent it almost
always ends up being 17 years from issue date :-)

"If users are made to understand that the system administrator's job is to
make computers run, and not to make them happy, they can, in fact, be made
happy most of the time. If users are allowed to believe that the system
administrator's job is to make them happy, they can, in fact, never be made
happy."
