Mainly I did it this way 'cause msg_address seems to be geared toward specific
hw (apic?).  In the case of altix interrupt hw, we don't know about
dest_mode et. al., but only care about the raw address.
I think this style makes it clearer that the core code should only be
using opaque data when interacting with the platform hooks and the MSI
registers.

My bad ... I used the alternate style elsewhere, just botched this one up.

Are you suggesting just have:
struct msi_callouts *msi_callouts = (some default value or NULL)
and then having each platform just assign msi_callouts in their msi_arch_init?
Doesn't matter to me either way ... I thought having an interface to set
the callouts was cleaner.

Christoph had similiar comments.  Will put some thought into it.
