I'm very puzzled.  The intention of "noexec" is to prevent execution
of files on that mount.  You're saying it's useless because it's
preventing execution of files on that mount?  It seems to me that
you simply have a mount where "noexec" presents more problems than
it solves: so don't use it there.  That doesn't mean it's useless:
not every mmap involves PROT_EXEC, not every mount demands execution.
