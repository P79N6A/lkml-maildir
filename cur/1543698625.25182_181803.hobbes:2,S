Your patches seem to work fine for my keyboard -- it reconnects and works
smoothly (the interrupts are fine). My Synaptics touchpad is however not
present after resume -- no response and no mention of i8042 in
/proc/interrupts after S3 resume. I attach a dmesg excerpt in hope that
helps you in any way. Thanks for the good work!
