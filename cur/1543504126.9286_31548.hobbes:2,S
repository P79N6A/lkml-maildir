  Hello.
  I think I've found a bug in make_request() in ll_rw_blk.c in 2.3.10 or 11. The
problem is that when access beyond the end of device is done, all flags except BH_Locked
are cleared. This also means clearing of flag BH_Mapped so when you try  to read the block
second time, ll_rw_block() complains about not mapped buffer and does BUG()...
My fix simply preserves the BH_mapped flag too but I'm not sure this is the right fix.
If it is, the patch is attached.
							Honza.
