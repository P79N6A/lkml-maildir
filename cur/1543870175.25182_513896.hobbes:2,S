Well, I don't really think so, but we need to store some information in the
freezer (eg. in a status variable).  Namely, we can define a variable, say
tasks_frozen, the value of which will be the bitwise or of the flags
SPE_SUSPEND, SPE_HOTPLUG etc.  In a fully functional system, tasks_frozen
is equal to zero.  If freeze_processes(SPE_SUSPEND) is run, it does
tasks_frozen |= SPE_SUSPEND and analogously for SPE_HOTPLUG etc.
If tasks_frozen is equal to SPE_SUSPEND|SPE_HOTPLUG,  for example, and
thaw_tasks(SPE_HOTPLUG) runs, it only thaws the tasks that need not stay frozen
for the suspend and does tasks_frozen &= ~SPE_SUSPEND etc.
I think something like this should work.
