I expect it to be a USB 2.0 problem, not a reiser4 problem. I've seen
this kind of behavior when trying to copy data to an ext3 filesystem on
an USB 2.0 IDE converter. If you use the drive with a USB 1.1 host
controller, it will probably succeed. I haven't yet figured out if it
is a usb-storage problem or a hardware problem (in the USB IDE
converter).
