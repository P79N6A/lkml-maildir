I was actually thinking of just giving more flexibility to the user
locks, in case the application using them needed more information, for
debugging or whatever.  Honestly, I haven't looked at the fusyn code
yet, so I don't really know if there is a difference.  As I said, I
"feel" the user lock should be different. I really don't know if they
should.
So, to answer your question. Looking forward, I kind of see two
different structures for locking.  The rt_mutex and something that is
used by fusyn, then there being some common structure (or ops) that they
both use to implement the PI.  But the implementation of how the locks
work may as well be different. But this may not be the case, and there
still be two structures but the fusyn just contain a rt_mutex lock to do
the actual locking and the rest of the structure be used for showing
information or what not back up to user space. This stuff wouldn't be
necessary for the rt_mutex. We need to keep rt_mutex small since it is
used all over the place.
That's all I meant.
