I was recently challenged:

And you know, maybe that *is* the right answer.  Just teach the backup
software that inode number zero means there are no hard links and
the kernel's tired of lying to it.
Yes, this affects a lot of applications, but it's a trivial fix to each
one.
There just *is* no good fix the the FAT inode number problem for zero-length
files.  There is no way to distinguish
mv foo bar
touch baz
from
touch bar
mv foo baz
