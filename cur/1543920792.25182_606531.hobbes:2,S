Can you please send my '[PATCH] cleanup fid types mess' to Linus aswell?
I have a stack of 15 patches reworking the nfs exporting code waiting
in -mm to get in in this merge window that depend on this cleanup to
free struct fid for generic useage.
Also getting the makefile cleanup into mainline to reduce spurious difference
would help a lot.
