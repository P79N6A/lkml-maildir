Not nearly as much of a fit.  The effect on x86 is that values between
-4095 and -1 are reported as -1, so the end-start difference will be
out by less than 41 seconds.  That's not nearly as dramatic as a
difference of 21 million seconds (over 16 years). :)
I really think that wrapping at 0x7fffffff makes the situation worse,
not better.
Paul.
