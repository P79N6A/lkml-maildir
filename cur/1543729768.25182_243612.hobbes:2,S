Point taken.. I'll blame the 21'' for not noticing the length :)

The author didn't like it, but he still put it in, so there must
be a very good reason for it, no? Anyway I will try it out this
evening.
The code also indicates that it is to reset back to 2 channel mode, 
but my notebook only has 2 output channels - so in my case I can
probably skip the entire code snippet.
I'm not a kernel hacker, but I wonder if a lock around the driver
initialisation wouldn't allow it to run with preemption turned on?
Karl.
