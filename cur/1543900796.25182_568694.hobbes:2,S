Incidentally, we have a helper for this operation:
#if MAX_NUMNODES > 1
...
#define first_online_node	first_node(node_online_map)
...
#else
...
#define first_online_node	0
...
#endif
So I suppose we should use that - it should generate better code for
non-NUMA builds.
It's a pretty sadly implemented helper though.  It should be
"first_online_node()", not "first_online_node".
I'm scratching my head over that min_t in __first_node(), too.   I don't think
it's possible for find_first_bit(..., N) to return anything >N _anyway_.  And if
it does, we want to know about it.
