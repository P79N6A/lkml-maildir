Don't mix the GPL and the patent rules, they are not the same thing.  
To the extent that RTL code is derived from GPLed code, it has to 
obey the GPL, that's true.  But the patent does not have to obey the
GPL, one are is copyright law (that's what covers the GPL) and the
other is patent law.
FSMlabs can make any rules they want for their license of their patent.
The fact that the GPL doesn't want additional restrictions has no bearing
on the patent law.

Definitely "money changed hands".

Well, as someone who has been working in a somewhat similar manner, I can
say that there is a very unhealthy tendency for the free software community
to be fanatical and somewhat self destructive on these topics.  There are
piles of people who want to make money off of your work and have absolutely
no intention in sharing that money.  And they get pissed as hell when you
figure out a way to force them to share that money.  After a while, you
get pretty sick of people yelling at you and you just start to ignore them.
I've spoken with Victor about this topic a few times and while I will not
speak for him in specifics, I will say he's equally unthrilled with a lot
of what gones on.  It's tiresome.
