Suggestion: Try setting the idle_threshold to a higher value,
e.g., 98.  (The default value is 95.)
Question to all: Would it be a good idea to de-idle the CPU
inside interrupt handlers?

Try disabling APM cpu idling (set apm idle_threshold to 100) in the
_guest_ OS.  (Leave it enabled in the host OS.)  Tell us what happens.
Also try disabling APM cpu idling (set apm idle_threshold to 100) in
the _host_ OS.  (Leave it enabled in the guest OS.)  Tell us what
happens.
I repeat: You do not need to recompile the kernel to enable/disable
APM cpu idle: to disable it simply set idle_threshold to 100.
