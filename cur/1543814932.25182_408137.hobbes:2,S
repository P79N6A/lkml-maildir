This turns even minor buffer overflows into complete denials of service.
If we're running in process context and the process is currently
killable it might make more sense to printk() a message and zap the
process; that way we only halt whatever service it is the attacker
hit us through.
(I agree that this is much-needed: I'm doing the rough equivalent in UML
right now, where it's a good bit simpler, but having it for the real
kernel on bare metal will be great!)
