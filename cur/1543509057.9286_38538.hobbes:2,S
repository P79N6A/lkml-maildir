I too am having the same problem. 2.2.12 works fine and yesterday I
decided to try 2.3.18( and 2.3.18ac2 ) and had the same symptoms as you.
I'm using a beefed up version of RH5.2( everything updated to date by
hand not rpm ) on a K6-2:
 egcs 1.1.1
 glibc 2.1.2
 procinfo 17( tried 16 as well )
 procps 1.2.9( tried 2.0.3 as well )
 binutils 2.9.4( also tried 2.9.1 )
 ld.so 2.1.2( also tried 1.99 )
 util-linux 2.9u
switched back to 2.1.12 and the problem was gone. Recompiled both
kernels to make sure all the latest tools were used to build and the
problem still persists. Also recompiled glibc to be sure that wasn't the
culprit. /proc/meminfo reports no shared usage.
