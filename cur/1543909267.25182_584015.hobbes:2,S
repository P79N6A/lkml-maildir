I don't think you can do any serial specific stuff, like parity and stop
bits and the like across a pty.  You might have to actually write a
serial driver to present the devices and handle the ioctls, even if you
have a user space process handle the mux/demux between the real serial
port and the fake ports.
I am curious how you are going to pass the data to the external device,
and indicate which port the data should go through.  What will you do
when there is too much data being sent for the real serial port to
handle?  I guess if you had a single high speed port, that would be a
start.
