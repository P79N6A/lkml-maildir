Hi,
 - on COMPAQ Proliant 6500 (P11) servers I have an embeded LCD,
   is there any kernel patch and/or user tools to use it ?
 - lately one of those servers hangs quite often
   I've changed hardware parts (mixing from other boxes) and concluded it's
   definately software, most probably kernel.
   It's a web and ftp server banged quite hard.
symptoms are complete hang without any suspicious trace in logs except one:
  just before that complete hang logs are filled with for example proftpd entries
  with exactly _same time_. I even managed once to stay logged in when hang is just about
  to happen -> date(1) kept showing some exactly the same time in the past whenever invoked
  but cat /proc/driver/rtc showed the proper time. The box refused any new connections.
  Few minutes later it hung.
Any pointers ? Patches to apply ?
I tried nmi_watchdog and noapic things, does not help.
