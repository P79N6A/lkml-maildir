What about linux/Documentation/, which is maintained by us (as in `the
community', not by `commercial entity that can be pressured')?
At least for a `positive' lists it's not that difficult: if the driver is in
the tree, just add the supported hardware to the list in linux/Documentation/.
Whether we want to put a `negative' list there as well is another question.
Perhaps some form of `to do' or `drivers wanted' list?

In personal conversations with technical people, I call myself a hacker. But
when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
