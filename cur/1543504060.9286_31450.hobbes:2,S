FYI
Here is an article I found that I thought was pretty important.
 
http://www.entmag.com/displayarticle.asp?ID=72199111952AM
Will Linux run on this new Intel architecture? In the Future?
I have not seen any postings on TPC's page 
http://www.tpc.org
 for Linux.
I think it would be nice if Linux took part in these type of things. There
could be a tests done with these available database ports from Oracle,
Sybase, Informix, and IBM DB2.
I would be interested, anyone else?
Earle
