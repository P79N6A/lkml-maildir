Ouch indeed.  I was not looking for these things (I was just
porting not fixing).  Thank you for pointing it out.  Have a
couple of questions:
 - Would it be an acceptable alternative here to use blocking
   kmalloc upon entry with matching kfree before leaving?
 - I would imagine that the acceptable stack usage for functions
   would depend on where they are called and what they call.
   Coulc you suggest a rule-of-thumb number for
   address_space_operations.readpage (say, would 1kB be OK but
   not 3kB?)
 - Would the same rule apply to 2.4 filesystem layer?
