If a drive does reduced latency writes, then blocks can be written out
of order.  Also, for a trivial case:  with hardware RAIDs, when the
data for a single command is split across multiple drives, you can get
data blocks written out of order, no matter what you do.
I don't think a filesystem can make any assumptions about blocks within
a single command, though with ordered tags (assuming driver and device
support) and no write caching, it can make assumptions between commands.
