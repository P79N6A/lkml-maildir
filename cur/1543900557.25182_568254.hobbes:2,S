and the device/CPU quiesent/save/restore/sleep/wakeup functions are needed 
for suspend-to-ram and low-power mode.

you shouldn't need a device hibernate, hibernate will be a system 
shutdown.

the hibernate kernel shouldn't need a lot of the features of the standard 
kerneel (does it really need sound for example), and if tailored even 
tighter could be configured to only have the drivers actually used for the 
save and restore, makeing a _very_ minimal kernel (no USB, no network, 
only simple video drivers, etc) greatly speeding up the boot
