Derivative works don't get to cross boundaries.  A boundary is a trump
card, it's like a patent, it has strength.  Go dig into the legal
findings in this area.  My memory is that anything you can pull out and
replace with another implementation constitutes a boundary and you may
have different licenses on either side of that boundary without fear of
them fighting.  So a derivative work which can't be easily replaced 
doesn't get to have a different license than the basis.  On the other
hand, something which plugs into an interface, like a driver or a 
file system, could have a different license.
