Couldn't you just have the message sent to every process that has
opened the file (and have every interested process open the file and
read it in a non-blocking or blocking mode?)
That seems to negate the need for something like acpid, but it does
not preclude it's use.

I would prefer an event, and it can still be self contained if my
idea above is actually workable.
