Subject: Suggestion for CD filesystem for Backups

You can use CDs or DVDs for Backup purposes. They do error correction, 
everything is fine, until the errors get too much, than everything is 
lost. This is a nuisance for a backup, especially because normal people 
don't have the hardware to measure errors, jitter and the like.
Suggestion:
Why not write a file system on top of ISO9660 which uses the rest of the 
CD to write error correction. If a sector becomes unreadable, the error 
correction saves the data. Besides, a tool for testing the error rate 
and the safety of the data can be easily written for a normal CD-ROM drive.
The data for error correction might be written into a file so that the 
CD can be read using any System, but Linux provides error correction.
