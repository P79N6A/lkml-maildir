Subject: Odd Question: pc_keyb as a module?

I have a need to use pc_keyb as a module. I am using off the shelf ps/2
keyboard chipsets as chording keyboard controllers. This uses a modified
pc_keyb.c that see's multiple key presses and translates them into
scancodes that are then handled by the rest of the keyboard driver.
It would make life much better if I were able to have one pc_keyb.o module
that was the kernel original and another that has the chording code. That
way I could swap them, and I wouldn't need to rebuild and install an 
entirely kernel everytime I make a tweak to the chording code.
I'm not entirely sure home much trouble this would cause. But any help or
direction would be much appreciated.
Thanks,
