Folks,
Under the 2.0.36 kernel, my kernel module called ip_forward to send a
packet to the machine of my choice using the target_addr parameter,
regardless of the contents of the skbuff and its ip header.
With the 2.2.5 kernel, ip_forward is not an exported symbol, and even
if it was, the target_addr parm is gone (along with the device, etc).
Any suggestions on how best to achieve the same functionality,
with and/or without recompiling the kernel?
Thanks, Andy Dingsor
