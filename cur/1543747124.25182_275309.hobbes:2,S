ah yes, video.S, (sets PARAM_LFB_SIZE), which is why my grep failed.

Maybe.
Something I toyed with at one point, which only works for AGP cards is..
search the pci config space for an agp header, and then check the amount
of prefetchable memory range behind the bridge.
Even that wasn't foolproof however, and there were a few quirks
to work around still.  You see all sorts of strange things there,
like onboard gfx with 16MB advertising 64MB prefetchable ranges.
