Well, the same thing can be said about the vga= parameter in LILO and GRUB :-)
I think that the kernel documentation (svga.txt) is pretty clear and explicit
on the meaning of the numbers and I don't see any reasons to change the
behavior of the mode selector.
What IMHO needs updating is the documentation on the vga parameter in LILO
and GRUB docs, which doesn't explain well what's going on.
				Have a nice fortnight
