I think it may be safe to not deal with them and assume some other
interface (sysctl or something appropriate) will be used.

There are valid reasons to allow a PAG to be specified, but only with
priviledge. e.g. user mode protocol translator (afs to nfs)

Yes, I as the caller.

A uid could have tokens associated with it. They'd get used only for
PAGless processes running as that uid. Join a PAG and they stop being
visible to you (the caller)

The uid of the current process. Again, if you're in a PAG you don't get
uid tokens. You could create 2 PAG number spaces, 1 using uid
and one sequential alloc, but then you need more management I guess (or to
assume kernel code will be able to provide hooks for accepting tokens
regardless of PAG and just let people who care deal in their code)

Takes a path to attempt to prefetch as a text string.
