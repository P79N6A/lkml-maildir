Try to be more flexible with your thinking. It is ok to have a
transient, privileged command line app that does something like assign
an output to be under the control of a specific CRTC. I have no
problem with some of the IOCTLs requiring root priv.
What is not ok is to require a permanently running root priv process.
If the code is going to always be running make it as small as possible
and put it in the device driver.
