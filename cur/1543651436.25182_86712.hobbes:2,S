What I remember about hardware compatibility for SCO Unix and Solaris on
ia32 is _not_ funny. Lightyears from what Linux handles today without
breaking a sweat.

How do you test that? Not in some contrieved situation, under real crashes.
Don't just consider crashes in the official $DISTRIBUTION kernel, but in
Linus' BK tree, or some of the random, two-or-three-letter-trees of the day
(_that_ is where crashes happen, _that_ is where the info would be most
valuable). It gets _real_ hairy _real_ fast to make sure you don't scribble
over /home or /etc on the user's disk...

If you only handle a few, thoroughly tested, high-end controllers and
disks, that is not too hard to do.
