Hi Eric,
Thanks for doing this... It's looking good, I just have some minor

Can we pass in something other than the rw_semaphore here? Seeing as
it only actually gets used as a flag, it might be nicer just to pass
a 0 or 1? And all through the call stack...
Did the whole thing just turn out neater when you passed the rwsem?
We always know to use current->mm->mmap_sem, so it doesn't seem like
a boolean flag would hurt?

Shouldn't that be sizeof(long) to handle 64 bit futexes? Or strictly, it
should depend on the size of the operation. Maybe the access_ok check
should go outside get_futex_key?

I like |= for adding flags, it seems less ambiguous. But I guess that's
a matter of opinion. Hugh seems to like +=, and I can't argue with him
about style issues ;)

I wonder if it would be worthwhile inlining and likley()ing the
private fastpath? Might make it pretty compact... I guess that's
something to worry about after glibc gets support.

You've got an extra space after the if (maybe for clarity?). In this
situation I prefer putting braces around both the if and the else, and
if you get rid of that blank line, it doesn't cost you anything more ;)

Could you make this into a proper flags argument and use #define CONSTANTs for it?
