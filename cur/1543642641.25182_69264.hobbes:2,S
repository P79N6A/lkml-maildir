IDs of firewire/USB device are handled the same as any other SCSI device.
First attempted is scsi inquiry page 83 followed by page 80.  If all else
fails, it will just write in the manufacturer name/model name as its ID.

Except that for source RPMs sucking big time the stuff is REALLY cool!
I could also see benefits for other devices like HID where the current
ordering is done after a first come - first serve approach where the
minor device numbers follow the order the devices appear on the bus
which is quite easy to mess up and never consistent; Applying your
scheme to and-class devices also would allow to link whatever device
to a fixed device node which could solve many problems as far as
I can see.
Can you elaborate how you retrieve the IDs of a firewire or USB
controller?
