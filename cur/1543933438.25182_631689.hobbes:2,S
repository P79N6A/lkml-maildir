Cool stuff. I used to have one of these boxes myself, maybe I should
get one again when it's hitting mainline.
Is this already a complete port, or do you also need some device
drivers or boot wrapper code to go along with it?

I thought there are both models with 32MB and 16MB available.
If that's true, shouldn't this be filled out by the boot loader?

No hardware framebuffer driver? Can't you use
the FB_OF driver by default? I'd guess that a
set-top box without output is rather pointless ;-)

What media can you connect that use the FAT file system?
I'd guess that if you can get rid of these, you can also
disable the entire block layer, which should free up
some kernel memory.

You don't need the #ifdef __KERNEL__ any more if you don't have
any user-visible parts in the header. Just leave it out of the
list of exported header files (as you already do).

Can you move this functionality from the kernel to the boot wrapper?
It looks like this is something that really belongs into the device
tree.

This smells like a hack. What are AVIA chips, and shouldn't
their driver enable the IRQs?

What is this code for? Why do you want to detach nodes from the device
tree that have been put in there by the boot loader?

Shouldn't this check for 'compatible' properties instead of 'name'?

This is a candidate for the new platform_initcall stuff.
I also once did a patch that let you have a default 'of_bus_ids'
member in the ppc_md. I never got around to submitting that, but
if there is interest, I can dig it out again.

Don't hide #includes or platform specific #defines in #ifdef.
