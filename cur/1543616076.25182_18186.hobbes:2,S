Well, with the scheme I proposed most drivers won't need the
ifdef.  It'll just be:
	serial_driver.name = "cua";
With devfs enabled that expands to cua/42.  Without devfs it expands
to cua42.
Seems that some drivers have had their name changed when used under
devfs (tts/%d versus ttyS%d).  But a lot have not.
