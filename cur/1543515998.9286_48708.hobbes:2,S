Yes, intentionally, that was the slowest disk I found:
Linux single-threads the pageing-io, ie it cannot reorder the read
operations.
I wrote that this is a huge disadvantage, and the numbers show that.

I'll try it with a faster disk, but initial tests show that :
- NT gets faster if I add further threads
- Linux cannot reorder the disk io, and it remains at the same performance
for 1 thread and for 64 threads.
- the benchmark is io bound, ie the internal efficiency of the os doesn't
matter.
