Thanks. These are some nice improvements. I do have one suggestion
though:
Could we design it so that sdio_io_rw_ext_helper() sets the block size
itself? That way most drivers wouldn't have to care about that detail
and the core would be free to choose optimal values.
I suspect that some transactions might require a certain block size.
But we could satisfy that by stating that any transfer small enough to
fit into one block will not be split up.
(PS. You might want to add [PATCH x/3] to your subjects so that the
order of the patches is crystal clear)
