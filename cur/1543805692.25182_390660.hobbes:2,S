Hi Ravikiran
If I correctly read this patch, I think there is a scalability problem.
On a big SMP machine, read_sockets_allocated() is going to be a real killer.
Say we have 128 Opterons CPUS in a box.
You'll need to bring 128 cache lines (plus 8*128 bytes to read the 128 
pointers inside percpu structure)
I think a solution 'a la percpu_counter' is preferable, or even better a 
dedicated per_cpu with a threshold management (see mm/swap.c , function 
vm_acct_memory() to see how vm_committed_space is updated without too bad SMP 
scalability)
Thank you
Eric
