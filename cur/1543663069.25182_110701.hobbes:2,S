Eric,
I have carried forward the kexec patch set to 2.5.61 and 2.5.62.
Other than basic compile testing, I have not yet finished kicking the
tires on these patches.
There were some syscall hijinks in the merge up to 2.5.61 and in 2.5.62,
so you may need to edit/recompile the kexec tools for either of these to
work.
New in this set is a small change taken from the ppc64 tree via Suparna
Bhattacharya that made kexec on 2.5.60 work for me on a 2-way x86
system.
(Suparna: I have not yet tried your newer version of hwfixes).
The patches are available for download from OSDL's patch lifecycle
manager (PLM):
