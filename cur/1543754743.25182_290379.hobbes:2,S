Pulled, pushed into my tree. I verified the patch, and it is indeed
correct. Before we get an ACK for a command we sent, we still may
receive normal data. After we got the ACK we know for sure that no more
regular data will come, and can expect the command response.

OK. I'll go through them, and apply as appropriate. I still need to wrap
my mind around the start() and stop() methods and see the necessity. I
still think a variable in the serio struct, only accessed by the serio.c
core driver itself (and never by the port driver) that'd cause all
serio_interrupt() calls to be ignored until set in the asynchronous port
registration would be well enough.
