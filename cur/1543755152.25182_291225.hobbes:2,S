I agree that RCU ought to do the trick in a lot of cases. Unfortunately,
people haven't used RCU in a lot of code but an rwlock. I also like the
idea of rwlocks: Many readers or just one writer. I don't see the need to
take that away from people.  Here is an examble which even on a UP will
give problems without it:
You have a shared datastructure, rarely updated with many readers. A low
priority task is reading it. That is preempted a high priority task which
finds out it can't read it -> priority inheritance, task switch. The low
priority task finishes the job -> priority set back, task switch. If it
was done with a rwlock two task switchs would have been saved.

Yes it does. But one could make a compromise: The up_write() should _not_
be deterministic. In that case it would be very simple to implement.
up_read() could still be deterministic as it would only involve boosting
one writer in the rare case such exists. That kind of locking would be
very usefull in many real-time systems. Ofcourse, RCU can do the job as
well, but it puts a lot of contrains on the code. 
However, as Linux is a general OS there is no way to know wether a
specific lock needs to be determnistic wrt. writing or not as the actual
application is not known at the time the lock type is specified.
