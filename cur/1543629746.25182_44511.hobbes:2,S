Ugh Ugh Ugh. You need coherency algorithms for these.

Right. You need communication services and coherency algorithms for these ;-)

Ugh ugh ugh. Too many page faults; you need a scheduler capable of keeping
node affinity.

No. In the optimal case, nothing dies. ;-) In the less than optimal case, only
the processes affected directly by the failure die (the processes which had
dirty pages there etc).
In the really useless case, the entire cluster goes down like on a SMP box or
an unpartitioned CC-NUMA.
"In search of clusters" is definetely highly recommended reading. It is very
entertaining, too.
