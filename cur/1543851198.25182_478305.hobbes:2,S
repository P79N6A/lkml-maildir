Subject: [PATCH 59/61] IPV6: fix lockup via /proc/net/ip6_flowlabel [CVE-2006-5619]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
From: James Morris <jmorris@namei.org>
There's a bug in the seqfile handling for /proc/net/ip6_flowlabel, where, 
after finding a flowlabel, the code will loop forever not finding any 
further flowlabels, first traversing the rest of the hash bucket then just 
looping.
This patch fixes the problem by breaking after the hash bucket has been 
traversed.
Note that this bug can cause lockups and oopses, and is trivially invoked 
by an unpriveleged user.
