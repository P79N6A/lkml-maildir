It doesn't have anything to do with the series.
The 2.6.6-rc3-mm2 patch set could not be built (and that unifix patch
could not even be applied as a patch - due to being malformed).  So I
could not build and test the bitmap/cpumask patch against a vanilla
2.6.6-rc3-mm2.  Therefore I included a set of pj-fix-* patches, to get
2.6.6-rc3-mm2 healthy, before including the real bitmap/cpumask patches.
Notice that some patches are named pj-fix-*, and others named mask*.
And notice in the opening "[PATCH mask 0/15] bitmap and cpumask cleanup"
where I write:
pj-fix-1-unifix
pj-fix-2-ashoks-updated-cpuhotplug-6-7
pj-fix-3-ashoks-updated-cpuhotplug-7-7
pj-fix-4-include-mempolicy
pj-fix-5-syscall-return-semicolon
	Patches pj-fix-* should match fixes that you (Andrew)
	have already picked up.  You should ignore these
	if what you already have is just as good.  They are
	here so that I can be precise as to what source I
	am using for the basis of the following patches.
