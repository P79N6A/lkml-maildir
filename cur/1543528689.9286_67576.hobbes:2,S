We've got processor priorities, why not memory priorities? The very
important things (init) would get -19, the loggers maybe -2, and the
rest of the system 0. Unimportant tasks could then be given poisitive
numbers. These could, of course, be changed downward by root and a user
could change his own processes upwards (just like renice).
The memory overuse code could then just kill the highest-numbered
memory priority.
