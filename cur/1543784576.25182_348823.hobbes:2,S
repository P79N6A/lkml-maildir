	I've been trying to find ways to significantly reduce CKRM's kernel
footprint. I recently posted an RFC patch to CKRM-Tech describing a
5000-line reduction:
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=8132624&forum_id=35191
Feedback on the approach presented in the RFC patch would be
appreciated.
