There is a book on the Linux kernel.  It is for the version 2 kernel
but it's probably worth reading.
The title (there may even be more than one) is ``Linux Kernel
Internals''.
Actually, I'm sure there is another one but I cannot remember
the name.  I think this one is more detailed though.
You can get more details at amazon.com.
