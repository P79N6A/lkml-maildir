      There are actually two sets of headers here, which, unfortunately,
      are overlaid on top of each other in Linux;  the headers the
      kernel needs can be rotten with __inline__, __asm__, and __magic
      extension__ and it won't really matter.   The headers userland
      needs are the published interface, which can be sanitized into a
      real language because they aren't likely to change very often.
      The module interface isn't published, because it changes with the
      phases of the moon, but if the rapture does happen and Linux does
      get published module interfaces, a public set of headers wouldn't
      be beyond the pale.

      printf doesn't work too well in the kernel, either.  If people
      wrote modules in C++ (which seems perfectly feasable, though
      overkill for most of the stuff one might want to modularise)
      they'd figure out pretty quickly what things you can't do if
      you want to make your module actually work.
