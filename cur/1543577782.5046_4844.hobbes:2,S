It need not be a badly written driver, it could be a fine one
just trying to see if it can get 2^3 successive pages for
performance reasons. As long as it continues on its merry way when
this fails it would be fine, and this message just confuses users.
Plus, for this to be really useful as a catch-bad-guys tool it
would be nice with a hint as what causes it (EIP or even a
call trace).
