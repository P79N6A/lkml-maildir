I only became aware of Dan's ADMA work when he posted it last month,
and so far have not made any attempts to merge the I/OAT code with it.
 Moving forward, combining these interfaces certainly seems like the
right way to go.  I particularly like ADMA's handling of operations
other than just a copy (memset, compare, XOR, CRC).
