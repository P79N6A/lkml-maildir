Thanks for pointing out my flawed logic.  I wasn't quite sure what was
MIME and what wasn't.  How about the attached patch, instead?

I think the general opinion of posting patches as attachments
has changed over the last few years.  Mailers have been getting
a lot better at handling them, even quoting non-message-body
plain/text attachments in replies.  
Plus, a plain/text attachment message saved to a file can go
into 'patch' the same way that an inline one can.

 Linus and other kernel developers need to be able to read and comment
 on the changes you are submitting.  It is important for a kernel
 developer to be able to "quote" your changes, using standard e-mail
 tools, so that they may comment on specific portions of your code.
