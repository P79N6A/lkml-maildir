When systems have NMI kick off due to power failure, and you want to grab the 
log buffer to write it to flash before power really dies - every cycle 
counts.
A single function which does the copy as a loop (existing) is going to be much 
faster than the overhead of 1024 function calls to copy the last k.

There are lots of places in the kernel which have magic in them :)
