Subject: 2.4.17:Increase number of anonymous filesystems beyond 256?

Hello,
I have to increase the number of anonymous filesystems the kernel can handle  
and found the array unnamed_dev_in_use fs/super.c and changed the array size 
from the default of 256 to 1024. Testing this patch by mounting more and more 
NFS-filesystems I found that still no more than 800 NFS mounts are possible. 
One more mount results in the kernel saying:
Jan 17 14:03:11 gl kernel: RPC: Can't bind to reserved port (98).
Jan 17 14:03:11 gl kernel: NFS: cannot create RPC transport.
Jan 17 14:03:11 gl kernel: nfs warning: mount version older than kernel
This bug can easily be reproduced any time. Does anyone know how to overcome 
this strange limitation? I am really in need of a solution to get a server 
running. Please help.
Thanks
Rainer
