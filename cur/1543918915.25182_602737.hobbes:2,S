Subject: [PATCH] [0/6] Some scheduler changes for sched-devel
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/7/106

- Various source code cleanups (no functional changes) 
- Shrink binary size by refactoring some code
- One K8 optimization that is unfortunately not measurable.
But it sounded good in theory! @)
(if you have a better scheduling latency benchmark than
lmbench3 it would be cool to try) 
- One real bug fix for a obscure problem
All against the sched-devel git tree with 
d024f67c652f7f0519d2a1906b646286abbb2e48 head.
Future wishlist: someone document all the magic numbers
in the load balancer code.
