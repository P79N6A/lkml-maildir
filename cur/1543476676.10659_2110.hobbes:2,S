There has been some discussion about the slowness of the mailing lists on
vger.  If people think this is really a problem, a reasonable answer might
be to get N trusted machines, divide the list by N, and fan out the list to
each of the machines to get some parallelism.
On a related topic, someone asked what vger is:
	[lm@vger lm]$ cd /proc
	[lm@vger /proc]$ cat cpuinfo
