Greetings potential victims :)
Care to see if the attached cures your woes?
This is a mixture of Ingo's last posted plus the scheduler tuning knobs 
patch (/proc/sys/sched/*).  I added three new knobs to watch the effect on 
different loads.  max_accel_slices limits the amount of sleep_time you may 
add in one activation.  retard_prct_slices is a percentage of a slice to 
deduct from sleep_time each activation (negative feedback for heavy context 
switchers.. dang irman process_load).  force_switch is there because I'm 
playing :)  I didn't do much to the scheduler itself, only made it switch 
arrays in something closer to a square wave.  With the settings as in the 
patch, and running a kernel build, top and irman, irman reports worst case 
response times of 150ms for NULL load, 316ms for memory_load, 414 for 
io_load, and 504ms for process_load.
Anyway, it's attached if you want to play with it ;-)

Oh, it's against virgin 2.5.66. [unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]
