There wasn't actually much code in there. And defining 
asm-generic/atomic-long-on-32bit.h and asm-generic/atomic-long-on-64bit.h
like you essentially proposed would just obfuscate the code, not make it 
easier to maintain.
Aiming for common code is ok, but only when it actually improves
maintainability.
