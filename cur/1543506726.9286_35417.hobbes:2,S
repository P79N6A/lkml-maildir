> Will future kernels ave an O_DIRECT like flag to avoid caching ?
Stephen Tweedie has written a patch for unbuffered I/O; the URL I have
from some time ago is
ftp://ftp.linux.org.uk/pub/linux/sct/fs/raw-io
though this host doesn't seem to respond at the moment.  I believe
Stephen has mentioned that this will go into the main tree at some point.
(Possibly it's already in 2.3.x---I haven't looked recently.)

I agree; the raw-io system will make this much more pleasant.
