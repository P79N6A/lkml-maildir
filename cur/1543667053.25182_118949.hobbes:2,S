	Not really, I think, because the 1238 seems a slightly fluke
run.  I see these from time to time, but almost all of the deadline runs
are in the 1500-1600 range.  In fact, -mm2 is lower than some other
kernels by about 50 for deadline.
	I wouldn't disagree with you if I didn't see that consistency.
antic has never really jumped above 1500, and deadline almost never goes
below.
	Certainly they are much closer than they were.
