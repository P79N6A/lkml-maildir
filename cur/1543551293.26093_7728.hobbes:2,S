Hello !
I think that you should wait a bit before writing a config in /proc for the
bonding driver.
I have rewritten quite a part of it to support link detection and make it a bit
fail safe.
Moreover, I had to rewrite partly ifenslave.c (which is included in the same
patch). Everything
*seems* to work fine (even in SMP now) and I've submitted this to Thomas Davis
after
Constantine Gavrilov has done some tests. If you're interested in, I can send
you the currently
working patch (with longer doc). It may change the way you planned your
configuration in /proc.
Regards,
Willy
