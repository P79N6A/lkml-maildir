I have one of these beasts so I decided to test it after seeing this 
message.  2.6.0-mm2 NAPI enabled and I am not seeing any of the symptoms 
described here.  My test consists of downloading an iso from RedHat's ftp 
site.  I'm not sure that is generating the kind of traffic you are talking 
about, but I'm open to suggestions on what test to run trying to duplicate 
what is being reported.
