RCU is for non-blocking operation only.
Maybe it could be use for maintaining an unlocked variable that prevents 
readers from entering a critical section --- but waiting in a write for a 
quiscent state would hurt.

I see --- I could replace that semaphore with mutex. But rw-semaphores 
can't be replaces with them.
