We can handle them directly. What we cannot do however is handle them directly
in netif_rx() . The syncppp processing overhead is too high to put in the IRQ
path of the Z85230.

Add an ETH_P_CHDLC I think

It causes too much work - I tried it originally. The 85230 is very very
time sensitive as its a paticularly stupid chip and people insist on running
it at 512Kbit.

Just make them non static. They are static because nobody needed them
