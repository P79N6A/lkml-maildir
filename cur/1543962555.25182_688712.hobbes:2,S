dunno, really.  Merging it would bust git-sched and linux-next, which is of
course solveable, but a hassle.  If there are bugs in there then linux-next
and -mm testing will pick up some of them.  Mainline testing would pick up
more.  Is that delta worth it?  dunno, really.
Experience tells us that decent testing of new debug infrastructure
(especially that which goes BUG) before it goes mainline is a good idea.

a static inline would be better.
- It matches the other version, which is aesthetically pleasing
- It provides type-checking when CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=n
