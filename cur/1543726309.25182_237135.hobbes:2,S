Thanks, text is now:
Q: Kernel thread must voluntarily freeze itself (call 'refrigerator'). But
I found some kernel threads that don't do it, and they don't freeze, and
so the system can't sleep. Is this a known behavior?
A: All such kernel threads need to be fixed, one by one. Select place
where it is safe to be frozen (no kernel semaphores should be held at
that point and it must be safe to sleep there), and add:
            if (current->flags & PF_FREEZE)
                    refrigerator(PF_FREEZE);
If the thread is needed for writing the image to storage, you should
instead set the PF_NOFREEZE process flag when creating the thread.
I'll eventually push it, too.
