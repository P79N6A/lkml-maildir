I've worked in the storage industry for years and surprisingly more and more
organizations *are* moving to disk only backup strategies with a lot of good
reasons for doing so. Large companies are replacing 100% of their tape
infrastructure with multiple large yet inexpensive disk array's. Disk backup
infrastructure prices are now equal to or lower than tape backup
infrastructure prices on initial acquisition, and significantly lower if you
factor in ROI and TCO - not to mention huge backup/restore time savings and
potential disaster recovery possibilities.

With multiple inexpensive large disk arrays from companies like Network
Appliance (NearStor) and Exstor (T-2120) organizations are asynchronously
mirroring their data to geographically distant locations to prevent single
points of failure with their arrays. As you suggest, a single array can fail
and lose data. From a tape perspective, a tape in a backup set can fail as
well-potentially presenting the same catastrophic situation of not being
able to recover. Just as organizations have multiple sets of tapes on a
rotation schedule, organizations now often have multiple large near-line
storage arrays with a data rotation schedule.

Classical Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) as you describe here is
being undermined by the fact that these large IDE based disk arrays are
equally or less expensive than tapes. In addition, HSM software costs
something (even if you write it yourself) on top of the tape infrastructure.
One customer of ours was quoted 40K per TB of HSM *software* alone. Well
designed tape replacement disk systems can cost 25K per TB or less and have
many advantages over tape. Online data, faster data access, and disaster
recovery just to name a few. Further, backup software vendors like Veritas
and Legato now recognize disks as a viable tape replacement and are
incorporating that fact into their software.
If tape is absolutely required, the infrastructure required per TB of taped
data can be significantly smaller and the backup window can be massively
extended - from hours to weeks with a large near-line disk approach. The
tape/library cost component in this way is significantly reduced.
For purposes of full disclosure, I work at Exstor and we provide tape
replacement solutions as well as high performance NAS solutions for the
enterprise.
