We're working on it, trust me :-)
I have a simplification in mind that should take care of the issue
that led us to these problems.  We should simply pass in "ceiling"
as "-1" instead of "0".  Every single test against ceiling is
really done against "ceiling - 1".
Therefore, passing ceiling in as "top - 1" and then adjusting the
tests will clean this up substantially and make is much simpler.
I'm even sure that other similar refactoring is possible.
Hugh took the quantum leap we needed by implementing this at all,
some spaghetti code tests do not detract from his work conceptually.
That kind of stuff can be cleaned up.
