Ah, this looks nice.  For kobjects I would like to track the above, as
well as:
	- use of initialized objects
	- use of "freed" objects
	- objects that are never destroyed, yet the code controlling
	  them thinks they are.
I say "freed" as sometimes kobjects are in static structures and are not
in memory that ends up being kfree() so slab poisoning doesn't help.
Do you think that would be able to worked into this framework?  At first
glance, it seems like it would be easy to add, but would like to make
sure.
If so, I'll gladly add this to the kobjects to help with issues there.
thanks,
