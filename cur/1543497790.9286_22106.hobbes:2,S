I'm still trying to get an alpha kernel built that will boot on our
AlphaStation-1200.  Most recently I downloaded a "pure vanilla" 2.2.9
source from ftp.us.kernel.org, then applied Alan's ac1 patch to it. 
There were a few interesting oddities in the patch, but the killer is
this:
make -C  arch/alpha/kernel
make[1]: Entering directory
`/usr/markh-ext/src/arizona2/mesa_os/arch/alpha/kernel'
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/markh-ext/src/arizona2/mesa_os/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -D__SMP__ -pipe
-mno-fp-regs -ffixed-8   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c alpha_ksyms.c
alpha_ksyms.c:173: `spin_lock' undeclared here (not in a function)
alpha_ksyms.c:173: initializer element for `__ksymtab_spin_lock.value'
is not constant
make[1]: *** [alpha_ksyms.o] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory
`/usr/markh-ext/src/arizona2/mesa_os/arch/alpha/kernel'
make: *** [_dir_arch/alpha/kernel] Error 2
("mesa_os" is the equivalent of the "linux" directory in most sources)
I tried several differences between the straight 2.2.9 and the patched
source and can't find anything obvious that would cause this.  Any
ideas/suggestions?
