SG_IO is an ioctl in the sg driver that issues scsi commands
and waits for a response. The route from sg is through the
scsi mid level and via ide-scsi to the ide subsystem. Nothing
in the SG_IO ioctl interface addresses ATA DMA and PIO settings.
They can be changed via the hdparm ** command.
The experience from the early 2.4 series was that the ide
subsystem was too aggressive in its DMA settings for CD/DVD
burners. [My experience with scsi devices is that disks have
much better target implementations (i.e. more robust) than
CD/DVD devices and scanners.] Later versions of the 2.4 series
are a lot more conservative in their speed treatment of ATAPI
devices. The robustness comes at the expense of system load.
** Even though a CD writer appears as /dev/scd0 with ide-scsi
appropriately configured, the hdparm command can still be used
on /dev/hdd (for example, if the writer is the slave on the
second IDE bus).
