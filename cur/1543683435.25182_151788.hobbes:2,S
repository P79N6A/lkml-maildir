Hi,
From nvnet.c:
   /* 
     * Mac address is loaded at boot time into h/w reg, but it's loaded 
backwards
     * we get the address, save it, and reverse it. The saved value is loaded
     * back into address at close time.
     */
PRINTK(DEBUG_INIT, "nvnet_init - get mac address\n");
    priv->hwapi->pfnGetNodeAddress(priv->hwapi->pADCX, priv-
>original_mac_addr);
But I don't think the only thing missing is the MAC address. You could try to 
manually set it in the source itself and see if anything works.
