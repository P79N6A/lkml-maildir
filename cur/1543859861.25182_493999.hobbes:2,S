This needed to be fixed, and quite frankly, things don't get fixed nearly 
as quickly if you don't just break them first. And there really were just 
two filesystems that got broken, cifs being one of them.
I just can't test it.

CIFS _should_ be using "clear_page_dirty_for_io()" in that place, and that 
will fix the build. However, the reason I didn't just do that myself is 
that I can't test the end result, and for the life of me, I can't see 
where CIFS does the "end_page_writeback()" that it needs to do at IO 
completion time.
And the thing that confuses me about that, is that if CIFS doesn't do 
"end_page_writeback()", then it was already broken before - because when 
the VM calls "->writepage()" the clear_page_dirty_for_io() will have been 
done by the VM, and it needs that "end_page_writeback()" so that the 
system can know when the IO is done.
I _suspect_ that those "unlock_page()" calls should be accompanied by a 
"end_page_writeback()" call, and that the proper patch MAY look something 
like the appended, but I worry about having missed something really 
subtle. Maybe there's a end_page_writeback() somewhere else.
And if there isn't, I wonder if shared mappings have _ever_ worked on 
CIFS? And if so, how? That writeback bit thing isn't new per se.
So this may or may not fix it. If you can test it (_including_ with some 
dirty shared mmap-on-mmap action, please - just call me kinky), I'll 
commit it. But I need somebody who actually uses this to test it.
