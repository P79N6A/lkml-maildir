I'm hoping that all I'll need to do is make a simple driver to implement hard_start_xmit and let pppd do the rest.  Probably like your radio, it has a 0-7 network id which I assume you are including in your MAC addr some how.

Yes, I am quite willing to share the code.  In fact, I hope to have 
everything wrapped up
by the end of this week, and after a little testing, will make it 
available on our website for
download.  I'll send an email off-list to anyone interested once it's ready.
Cheers!
Larry
