What about including this in the API?
sth. like 
#define smp_mb(why) do { \
	static __debugdata__ char __lock_reason[] = why; \
	} while(0)
would be sufficient. __debugdata__ section
will then be stripped from compressed image but not vmlinux.
Is there another way to force developers to comment? ;-)
