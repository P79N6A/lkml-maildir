It depends. You probably mean the software which turns text or a bitmap 
into control codes that can be sent to a printer down, say,  a parallel 
port. In this case, the driver is typically part of Ghostscript, and 
nothing to do with the kernel.
If you mean you have a special device (for example, the Sparcstation's 
laser printer device) which needs to be created support from the kernel is 
needed to do the physical communication, but support from Ghostscript would 
also, typically, be needed, to do the rasterisation.
Does that help?
