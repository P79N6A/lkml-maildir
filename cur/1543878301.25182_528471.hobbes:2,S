The usual test_bit that we are using there uses a volatile reference 
so these wont be combined if I check them separately.
A working example of the above would be much uglier:
static inline int page_tail(struct page *page)
{
 	return ((page->flags & ((1L << PG_compound)|(1L << PG_tail))) == 
((1L << PG_compound)|(1L << PG_tail)));
}
May be this can be cleaned up somehow.

Two volatile references in the bit opes that the compiler cannot combine. 
Wont work unless we clean up the bitops first. This means we still have 
two branches in the code. Maybe I can make the first one work.

Still two branches which cannot be optimized in the same way as the single 
on on IA64 as shown by the asm that I included.

A new page flag does reduce the number of branches. On several platforms
it eliminates the branch completely since a single instruction can be
conditionally skipped.

Yes, it is common for slabs to only have a single page.
The most promising avenue seems to be the simultaneous check for two bits.
