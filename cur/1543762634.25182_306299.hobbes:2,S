The esp value is always slightly below the stack vma and above ld.so.
Running it a few times gives 
stack VMA         crash esp

I'm using the dosemu-1.2.1-3 binary that currently comes with debian
sarge, and would prefer not having to build a new dosemu. As far as
I can tell, the command.com that is started belongs to freedos, not
comcom.
The crash however does happen shortly after the command.com file
is opened.
