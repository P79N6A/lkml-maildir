Video decoder is not part of 3d engine. In fact if we are not transferring 
data via DMA into system RAM the video decoder will be running 
continuously and none of currently examined for quiescence flags would 
show it.
To do all this properly there should be a piece of code that knows all 
about currrent state of the card - which clocks are connected to what, 
which transfers are running and which parts of the engine are busy.
Btw, it would also be nice if that code received interrupts that can occur 
when user hotplugs monitors.
