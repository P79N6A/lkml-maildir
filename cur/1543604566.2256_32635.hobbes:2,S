That's odd, my Red Hat servers have been
almost like appliances. Not perfect, but all
the problems I've seen could be dealt with.
I've seen worse problems in commercial
unices, e.g. unixware - yuk - and hpux.

They do break new ground, and are often the
first distro to implement new technology.
You have to know the red hat pattern:
x.0 release: New stuff, interesting, buggy
x.1 release: A passable cleanup of the bugs in .0
x.2 release: A smooth, polished, evolution of .1

(shrug) I had no idea it was alpha - it works
well for me, and I'm a vi man.
