For SMP, your only options at the moment are the two Tyan boards.  We had 
some issues with them on multiple small (256MB) memory modules, but they 
have been kind to us since we moved to 512MB modules.  Obviously, they 
have only been out a few months, so long-term stability is still up in the 
air.
The latest revision we received can boot headless (no video card) off a 
serial port.  Linux, of course, can run console off serial, too.
We haven't had a hint of trouble with the Gigabyte GA-7DX, but we haven't 
pushed it past 1.2 GHz and 512MB.  YMMV, especially since a couple people 
here mentioned issues with large capacity memory modules.  The AMD 761's 
AGP support is also as fragile as glass -- not that it sounds like you'll 
use it.
