Reparenting would require diving inside this lot:
        /* 
         * pointers to (original) parent process, youngest child, younger sibling,
         * older sibling, respectively.  (p->father can be replaced with 
         * p->p_pptr->pid)
         */
        struct task_struct *p_opptr, *p_pptr, *p_cptr, *p_ysptr, *p_osptr;
        struct list_head thread_group;
plus maybe rewriting pgrps, sessions, gids, etc.  Challenging.
Plus it would mean that the kernel requires, for its
correct operation, that process "1" is a child reaper.
Is this a good thing?
