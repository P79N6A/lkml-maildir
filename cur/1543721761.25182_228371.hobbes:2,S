We gave up trying to use kernel versions to determine what features/interface
to use for a given kernel long ago.  Instead we have configure check for a
particular interface and use "#ifdef HAVE_foo", not "#if LINUX_KERNEL_VERSION".
I can understand why SuSE does this - there is no way they can ship the
"latest" kernel and still have tested it thoroughly, yet if they find a
specific defect they need to fix it (preferrably in the same way that a
later kernel fixes it).
Cheers, Andreas
