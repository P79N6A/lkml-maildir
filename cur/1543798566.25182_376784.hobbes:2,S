Hi,
I'm currently trying to find a solution for as it looks like an acpi
problem on a dell precision workstation 650, dual xeon w/HT.
Kernel: 2.6.14.3
Tried:
I tried all the conventional stuff of almost all acpi commands on the
bootprompt and things like (no)apic and so on.
The only way to make the box boot is by disabling every shred of acpi
and using noapic but that means for example no HT anymore.
Or by letting it reboot 5 to 12 times to get it to continue WITH acpi
and apic and end up with a suddenly working system. Seeing 2 real cpu's
and 2 virtual cpu's.
Just before the moment, during boot, when it's going to crash i see
something like:
...remote apic #(some number here) ...
Then when it's probing the apic #<numbers> to get ID/Version of the
cpu's they all come back with FAILED, then it reboots. Nothing is
logged, it just reboots quickly.
ACPI/DSDT:
Now i'm trying to see if this issue sits in the DSDT table or somewhere
else in the acpi data. The DSDT contains errors when trying to recompile
it with the intel compiler (IASL). I'm pasting here below the errors, it
would be great if some one can give a helping hand or at least if the
DSDT is responsible for this behaviour:
