Please convert the memory map from EFI into the e820 map in one place. This
would avoid all these weird special cases. Also custom memory map would
just work then.
I know i386 doesn't do it this way, but it's wrong and we'll eventually
fix it there too.
Also you have a few arbitary and white space changes in there that should be removed.
