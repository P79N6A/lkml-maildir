Any decent changelog for this two ? Docs in intel's website and downloadable
packages say just nothing.
And look interesting. I am running 2.4.19-rc2-jam1 on the cluster and NetPipe
performance jumped from 400 to 500 Mbits/sec (ie, 100Mb just for free).
Ehem, new kernel also included smptimers, so it is really the mix what
improves throughput. Anyone can say if the scalable timers can influence
network performance ??
TIA
