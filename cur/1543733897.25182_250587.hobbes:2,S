Hello,
I have received and tested the latest microcode data file from Intel, The
file is dated 2nd September 2004. You can download it both as standalone
(bzip2-ed) text file and bundled with microcode_ctl utility from the
Download section of the website:

Please let me know if you find any problems with this data file or with
the Linux microcode driver. Thank you.
Kind regards
Tigran
