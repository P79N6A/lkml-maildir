Master mode is in BIOS RAID, and PCI is BIOS non-RAID
What I have not thought about doing is forcing all "MASTER" modes into
"PCI" modes.  In theory it may work because it changes the properties of
the chips behavior.

This is what I love about Promise.
Mode 4 and Mode 5 have the exact same timings to the BUS; however, issuing
a setfeatures command to jump from Mode 4 to Mode 5, the card does voodoo
sensing.  It does internal tracking of the drive betweem these two modes
and auto-sets things in the chip.
If they can put that level of logic in the chips, it would be nice to have
it auto timing based on any setfeatures call to set the transfer rates.
