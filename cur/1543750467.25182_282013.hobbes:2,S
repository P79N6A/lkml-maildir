No no, my test case has nothing to do with the extra signal sent in 
do_syscall_trace(). But the test I put at the time:
-       if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE))
+       if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE) &&
+           !test_thread_flag(TIF_SINGLESTEP))
                return;
will make the code to not execute the "return" (in the single step case) 
and to fall through the point where the signal is sent.

This might explain what they were seeing, but OTOH it seems that the real 
cause of their problems is related to something else (according to other 
emails on this thread).
