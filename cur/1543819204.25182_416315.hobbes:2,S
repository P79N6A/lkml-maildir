again this isn't kernel specific this is chipset specific. 2.4 NEVER
balanced irqs manually, and 2.6 has an optional in-kernel balancer which
is very conservative and which RHEL disables. Again only SOME, old,
hardware does balancing in hardware.

I think I highly disagree with your statement.
1) I think you are too narrow focusing on "kernel" rather than OS.
2) Why would an OS NOT be SMP even without any IRQ balancing at all?
   (note, on just about any system irq load is < 1% even of 1 cpu)

because hardware stopped doing the balancing and it turned out that a
userspace balancer could do much better than the hardware anyway

nothing happened to the kernel. Hardware changed.
