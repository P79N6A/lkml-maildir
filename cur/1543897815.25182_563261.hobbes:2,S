Do you try omnibook driver?
svn export 
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/omnibook/omnibook/trunk
toshiba_acpi don't work on my Toshiba M45-S355 (Toshiba BIOS) and I try 
this module above and now I can change brightness writing in 
/proc/omnibook/lcd and kpowersave can change brightness too.
But, is impossible use multimedia keys (play, pause, browser, etc) and 
couple keys (fn-fx), because Fn key and Multimedia keys don't is recognized.
