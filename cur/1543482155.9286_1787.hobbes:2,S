I can still reproduce it.
The reason it happens is that semaphores are now recursive.  Here is the
loop:
  request_irq (..., func_that_ups_semaphore);
  tell_hardware_to_generate_irq_when_ready ();
false_alarm:
  set_a_1s_timer;
  down_interruptible (semaphore);
  if (!hardware_ready ())
    goto false_alarm;
As soon as a false alarm occurs, we already own the semaphore, and so we
spin forever.  Before semaphores went recursive, this wasn't the case.
I'm using semaphores rather than (say) waitqueues because I don't want to
lose any interrupts through things like this:
void irq_handler (...)
{
	if (!waitqueue_active(...))
		/* Missed an interrupt. */
		return;
	wake_up (...);
}
If there's another atomic primitive I should be using, please let me know,
but I kind of thought that this is what semaphores were for.
By the way, there really should be a "if (need_resched) schedule();" in
that loop, so that a confused parallel port that keeps sending interrupts
for no reason doesn't bring the system to a halt.  But that's another
story.
Tim.
