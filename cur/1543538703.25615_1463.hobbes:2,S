Thanks, that did it, BIOS upgrade helped a lot. Web page for Compaq ProLiant 6500 (P11)
contains very fresh BIOS upgrade (23/Jun/2000) that solved most of my problems.
It boots SMP now and both ethernet and scsi works. Next problem is how to get both
eepro100 cards working together but that'll go directly to maintainer.
Thanks again to all of you that tried to help,
