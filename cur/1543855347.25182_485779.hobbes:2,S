I still can't relax, another attempt to "prove" this should not be
possible on CPUs supported by Linux :)
Let's suppose it is possible, then it should also be possible if CPU_1
does spin_lock() instead of mb() (spin_lock can't be "stronger"), yes?
Now,
	int COND;
	wait_queue_head_t wq;
	my_wait()
	{
		add_wait_queue(&wq);
		for (;;) {
			set_current_state(TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
			if (COND)
				break;
			schedule();
		}
		remove_wait_queue(&wq);
	}
	my_wake()
	{
		COND = 1;
		wake_up(&wq);
	}
this should be correct, but it is not!
my_wait:
	task->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;		// STORE
	mb();
	if (COND) break;				// LOAD
my_wake:
	COND = 1;					// STORE
	spin_lock(WQ.lock);
	spin_lock(runqueue.lock);
	// try_to_wake_up()
	if (!(task->state & TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE))	// LOAD
		goto out;
So, my_wait() gets COND == 0, and goes to schedule in 'D' state.
try_to_wake_up() reads ->state == TASK_RUNNING, and does nothing.
Oleg.
