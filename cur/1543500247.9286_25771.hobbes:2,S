Subject: BUG: Mount Loopback FS over Block Dev in 2.3.7+

I've encountered a big problem with mounting loopback devices on remote
systems. I will explain the details below. I'm not Quite sure if this worked
on 2.3.5 or not, but I just tested it out on 2.2.5 and there is no problem
with it; i.e. 2.2.5 works the way it should, 2.3.7+ is broken.
What I did:
-----------
Let us pretend there are two machines, Mach_A and Mach_B.
On Mach_A:
# dd if=/dev/zero of=diskimage bs=1k count=32768
That should create for me a zeroed image file, 32Mb.
# mke2fs -m0 -i32768 diskimage     ; Create the filesystem in that file.
# mkdir /ext0
# mount -o loop diskimage /ext0    ; Mount the new filesystem via loopback.
# cp -a /stuffIneedtocopy/* /ext0  ; Copy my files over.
# umount /ext0
Now I should have a perfectly valid loopback image. Note that this procedure
so far works perfectly on a 2.2.5 kernel.
-------------------------
On Mach_B, mounting Mach_A over NFS:
I have rd.c set up to use 16 ramdisks of 32768K. I only use /dev/ram0.
NFS is fully mounted. I proceed to copy my diskimage file into /dev/ram0.
I have a special program that copies text into /dev/ram0 with a blocksize of
4K, but this should also work too (as it does on 2.2.5):
# cd /nfsdir
# cat diskimage > /dev/ram0
# mount /dev/ram0 /ext0
Now I can correctly mount /dev/ram0 as it was from the image file.
The problem occurs when I actually go into it. The directory structure looks
perfectly okay..
# cd /ext0/etc
# ls -l
total 440

# cat group
<No output>
# less group
^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@
(END)
More or less, all the files here have NULL characters in them, the amount of
NULLs equal to the size of the file.
Note that if I do this same procedure in 2.2.5, 'cat group' actually prints:
root::0:root
(as it should).
---------------------------
This is the thing. If IN 2.3.7/2.3.8, if I do:
# mount -o loop /dev/ram0 /ext0
INSTEAD OF
# mount /dev/ram0 /ext0
so that /ext0 uses /dev/loop0, it works perfectly as it should, and
'cat /ext0/etc/group' prints the correct output. For it to work on 2.3.8
though it MUST be mounted as loopback.  Please fix so that such a filesystem
does not need to be mounted from /dev/loop0.
---
Final comments:
---------------
Somewhere in the new FS code I believe mounting a filesystem on /dev/ram0
(or perhaps /dev/fd0 too, any block device . . .) does not work if the
filesystem was first created in a file via Loopback (-o loop).
The actual mke2fs/mount -o loop on Mach_A does not seem to make any difference
if Mach_A was 2.2.5, 2.3.7, or 2.3.8.
I also tried this with ramdisk_size=4096 instead of 32768. Same problem occurs
only under 2.3.7+.
Please email me <byron@math.uakron.edu> if you have any questions about what I
am trying to get at, or if you need me to test any additional configurations
to track down the error.
