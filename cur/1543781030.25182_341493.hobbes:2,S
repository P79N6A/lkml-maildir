Good find, looks right to me, so far as it goes (why does this check
pfn_valid just on the first? and remap_pfn_range will not behave as
you'd expect on most of kmem, not before Nick kills PageReserved;
and there's the red-penned issue of vmalloc'ed areas too).
Perhaps you're the first to mmap /dev/kmem: before those 2.6.11 changes,
going back beyond 2.4.0, it seems to have expected to caller to subtract
PAGE_OFFSET from the virtual address to give the file offset (when doing
mmap, but not when doing read/write - senseless, especially given the
variable behaviour of lseek to negative offset before the read/write).
