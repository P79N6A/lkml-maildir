Accepted, but in that respect both implementations are identical.

	If you hope to get the meaningful behaviour with the same rules for
following wormholes and following symlinks I would like to hear details.
Really. That's where they differ big way.
	Another thing about wormholes being: life would be much simpler if
we considered devices and FIFOs that way. We don't need a namespace to
keep a bunch of dentries. But that's another story...

Umm... Almost so, except that amount of stack wastage *does* matter here.
OK, I'll rewrite the patch into that form (not a big problem).
