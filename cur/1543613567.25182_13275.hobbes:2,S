  Hi, all. Version 204 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
Patch directly available from:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rgooch/v2.5/devfs-patch-current.gz
AND:
ftp://ftp.atnf.csiro.au/pub/people/rgooch/linux/kernel-patches/v2.5/devfs-patch-current.gz
NOTE: kernel 2.5.1 and later require devfsd-v1.3.19 or later.
This is against 2.5.1. Highlights of this release:
- Removed long obsolete rc.devfs
- Return old entry in <devfs_mk_dir> for 2.4.x kernels
- Updated README from master HTML file
- Increment refcount on module in <check_disc_changed>
- Created <devfs_get_handle> and exported <devfs_put>
- Increment refcount on module in <devfs_get_ops>
- Created <devfs_put_ops> and used where needed to fix races
- Added clarifying comments in response to preliminary EMC code review
- Added poisoning to <devfs_put>
- Improved debugging messages
- Fixed unregister bugs in drivers/md/lvm-fs.c
				Regards,
					Richard....
