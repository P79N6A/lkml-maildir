It should not have to. If the page is locked because it is being paged
in, then we're guaranteed that the data is fresh from the server. If
it is locked because we are writing, then ditto.

I don't buy that explanation w.r.t. readdir: those pages should always
be clean. The global data structures might walk them in order to throw
them out, but that should be a bonus here.
In any case it seems a bit far fetched that they should be pinning
*all* the readdir pages...

I never liked the page_count() test, but Linus overruled me because of
the concern for consistency w.r.t. shared mmap(). Is the latter case
resolved now?
I notice for instance that you've added mapping->releasepage().
What should we be doing for that?
