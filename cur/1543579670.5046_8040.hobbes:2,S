Subject: Problem with Madge Tokenring (abyss.o) in 2.4.1-pre10

I've tried to contact the driver maintainer, but his email bounced.
I constantly get this message on the console while using a Madge Smart
16/4 PCI Mk2 (Abyss) token ring card.
kernel: Warning: kfree_skb on hard IRQ d08cfea9
My quick "not knowing what I'm doing" fix was to comment out the
printk. ;)
I dunno if this is the right place to ask, but maybe the maintainer will
see this message, or perhaps someone else can pick up the ball on this
one.
Thanks,
Bart Dorsey
