Thanks for getting back to me on this.
My cards are Olympus branded smartmedia cards (16mb & 64mb). The reader is
a Belkin usb reader (part # F5U141xMSD.
I have made a bit of progress. I've not changed my Linux install. Instead
today I bought myself a cheap 8 in 1 usb reader made by Typhoon. This
reads both cards just fine.
As the Belkin worked fine until I installed 2.6.0-test9 I would be
interested in applying your patch to see if it gets the Belkin working
again. Could you email me it please.
