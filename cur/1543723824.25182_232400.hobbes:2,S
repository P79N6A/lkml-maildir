Neither 2.6 nor 2.4 are broken. It was well known all the time that
HDIO_GETGEO returns CHS values that are close to useless: all partitioning
tools spend lots of time on partition table guesswork. I really don't see a
point in blaming 2.6 here.
Nevertheless we have the fact that parted and kernel 2.6 don't work well
together. Now what? To get out of this people have to get either a changed
parted or a changed kernel.
And IMO it's far better to fix parted than to reintroduce an obscure piece
of code into the kernel.
