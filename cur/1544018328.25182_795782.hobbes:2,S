[    0.296001] ..MP-BIOS bug: 8254 timer not connected to IO-APIC
[    0.296001] Kernel panic - not syncing: IO-APIC + timer doesn't work! 
  Boot with apic=debug and send a report.  Then try booting with the 
'noapic' option.

Able to get past this issue using "noapic", at which point things mostly 
work, but rsync of large iso images result in corrupt files.  Able to 
copy those same files using Vista on the same machine, or using Hardy on 
another machine.  This problem may not be related to the above, but it 
seems plausible to me that this might be an interrupt issue.
memtest86+ runs clean.
Quite willing to invest time in installing kernels or distributions on 
fresh hard drives, run tests, obtain debug information, and report back.
