This is dependent on the CPU/motherboard in use - AMD CPUs (up to the last
ones I heard about, anyway) don't have any built in thermal protection, they
rely on the motherboard to shut down the CPU in the event of
over-temperature. Intel CPUs since the Pentium II all shut down on excessive
over-temperature; Pentium 4s will also clock-throttle to continue operating
before they get to this point.
