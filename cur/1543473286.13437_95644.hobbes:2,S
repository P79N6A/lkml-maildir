I get the following error on a 2.1.131 UP kernel when a new (different)
SCSI zip disk is inserted and accessed while listening to something
via Real Player.  NCR53C810 & Sound Blaster 16.  When this happens,
rvplayer stops playing although it looks like data is still comming
over the network.  After a stop and a play, rvplayer is back to
normal.  Sound is a module, SCSI is not.  Redhat 5.2 + updates.
gcc version 2.7.2.3

p.s. I won't have access to the zip drive past today, so any testing
I can do will be very limited.
