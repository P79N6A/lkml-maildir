I sincerely apologize for not paying enough attention. Intel has fixed 
this issue 2 BIOS revisions ago[1], kudos to Suren Karapetyan for 
pointing this out. I just upgraded the BIOS and it indeed solves the 
problem. The mtrr still seems not to be going over 4000MB, but 
everything works without any visible slowdowns at all. Here is how the 
mtrr and the relevant dmesg line look like now:
reg00: base=0x00000000 (   0MB), size=2048MB: write-back, count=1
reg01: base=0x80000000 (2048MB), size=1024MB: write-back, count=1
reg02: base=0xc0000000 (3072MB), size= 512MB: write-back, count=1
reg03: base=0xe0000000 (3584MB), size= 256MB: write-back, count=1
reg04: base=0xf0000000 (3840MB), size= 128MB: write-back, count=1
(there is no reg05)
...
Memory: 4024568k/4063168k available (2894k kernel code, 37456k reserved, 
930k data, 252k init, 3145664k highmem)
...
Thank you for the help!
Peter
