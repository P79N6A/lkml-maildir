Oh sure. :)
I pondered adding various comments along the lines of "Don't insult the 
intelligence of the people you're sending it to by assuming they can't break 
it out for themselves.  Do assume they're lazy enough to tell YOU to do it, 
and reject the whole patch until then.  Ask yourself: would you rather get 
some of your code into the kernel, or none at all?"
And also a longer admonition, that getting mad about this sort of thing is a 
very common problem among newbies, and you just have to grow up and learn to 
leave all-or-nothing behind and live with shades of grey to function around 
here in the long term.
But I was trying very hard to keep it short.  Feel free to amend the patch if 
you can think of anything better to say. :)
I was also trying not to wander off topic.  There are all sorts of related 
areas like "gradual transition" vs "flag day" approaches to large patches.  
For now, if they're doing a large enough patch we can assume they've been 
enculturated.  (Well, mostly.)  In the long term, "theory of linux-kernel 
development" might not belong belong in SubmittingPatches.  Maybe a seperate 
document, or in a FAQ somewhere, or the README...  Dunno.

Thanks.  It seemed the thing to do. :)
