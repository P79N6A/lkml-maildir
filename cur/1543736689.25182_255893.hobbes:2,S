Resending as I forgot to CC Vojtech and Peter first time around...

Addition of Kensington ThinkingMouse / ExpertMouse support caused Synaptics
and ALPS protocol numbers to move to 8 and 9 respectively which broke Peter's
auto-dev detection. 
Vojtech, we need to keep protcol numbers stable, I propose something like this:
enum psmouse_type {
        PSMOUSE_PS2             = 0,
        PSMOUSE_PS2PP,
        PSMOUSE_THINKPS,
        PSMOUSE_GENPS           = 64,   /* 4 byte protocol start */
        PSMOUSE_IMPS,
        PSMOUSE_IMEX,
        PSMOUSE_SYNAPTICS       = 128,  /* 5+ byte protocols start */
        PSMOUSE_ALPS,
};
Peter, if we adopt the scheme above you will have to check both for old and
new protocol numbers; in addition you need to BTN_TOOL_FINGER device bit to
make sure you are dealing with a touchpad.
Any holes here?
