Yes, needless.
wakeup_kswapd() function mean
  - please make free memory until pages_high
  - and, I want to "order argument" conteniously pages.
then, shorter conteniously pages than "order argumet" pages aren't needed
by caller.
Unfortunately, your patch has more bad side effect.
high order shrink_zone() cause lumpy reclaim.
lumpy reclaim cause reclaim neighbor pages although it is active page.
needlessly active page reclaiming decrease system performance.
