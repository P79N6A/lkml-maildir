Oh... the kernel pci-irq code looks for the "compatible router" if it
is set; if unset, then it looks up the ID's of the router device.
0x8086, 0x1234 is not a known router type, so the kernel decides it
can't interpret the routing table.
0x8086, 0x1234 is listed in pci_ids.h as an 82371MX.  I'm suspicious 
of that: the MX chipset has an 82443MX, not an 82371.  In any case, I
think pci-irq.c should check both sets of ID's for a match.
