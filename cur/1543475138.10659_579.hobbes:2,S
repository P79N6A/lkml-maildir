Linux doesn't ignore it, ifconfig just doesn't display it. (Look at the routing
table, you should see a new entry for the router) You need to include 
"netmask 255.255.255.255". If the default route is via the router anyway, you
won't need to add any extra routing entries.

If the above doesn't work with the netmask bit, grab the patch at
ftp://complicity.olf.co.uk:2121/pub/autoroute.patch
 and add a line saying:
echo 0 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_autoroute
...to your rc files, before the first ifconfig line. If you have to do this
(You shouldn't, really) let me know as I'll then hassle someone to get it
included as part of the main tree, rather than an obscure patch for people that
like do strange things with IP routing.
