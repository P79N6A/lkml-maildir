May I ask something that might be obvious for most of the
development community:
Modules have to be loaded in seperate pages, right ?
Does that mean that each module wastes partially used
pages of memory at runtime ?
I've always tried to build as much into the kernel image as
possible, because all of my systems have only 512M memory.
Thanks,
