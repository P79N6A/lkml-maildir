Subject: Linux-2.2.2 bug or feature?

I upgraded from linux-2.0.36 to linux-2.2.2 by compiling
my own version of the kernel. (2.2.2) The other kernel was
the one installed with RedHat5.2. As I have little insight
into kernel-code, I'll describe what happened.
I'm in X (FVWM2), and had two xterms open.
In xterm1 I did the following:
  - mkdir test
  - cd test
  - mkdir test2
  - cd test2
In xterm2:
  - rm -rf test
And then in xterm1:
  - cd ..
This resulted in xterm1 crashing.
Could you please report back to me whether this is a bug
in the kernel, or if not, what is bugging.
Thanks!
