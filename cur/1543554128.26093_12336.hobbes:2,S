Hello,
  I received the following error while compiling test11-pre2:
rrunner.c : In function 'rr_ioctl'
rrunner.c:1558: label 'out' used but not defined
make[2]: *** [rrunner.o] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory '/usr/src/linux/drivers/net'
...
make: ** [mod_drivers] Error 2
out is located in the file, so I'm assuming its a bracing issue.
Regards,
Frank
