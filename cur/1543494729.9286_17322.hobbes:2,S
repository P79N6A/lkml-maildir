I know vaguely what you're talking about, but since I know almost nothing
about programming, I'll trust that you know what you're talking about.
One thing that I can do is mail the binary kernel image and its friends
the modules if that would help any -- i know that every built kernel is
different in some little way.

Nope.  I've got the box in a room that's 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and the
box is always open, because when the box was closed, I always had
overheating problems.  It's also got an overheat sensor (that's how I knew
of the problems ;)

Right.  I'm sticking to the vanilla kernel sources.  The only patches that
I use are the ones from one release to the next... I've been upgrading the
kernel using the patches since 2.2.0.
Usually, I upgrade within 48 hours of the kernel release.  The thing is
that my system is SO slow (486 dx/4) that it takes between two and three
hours to build a kernel.  I learned that the first time I built one.  So,
I do everything using cron, basically.
BTW... should I reboot my system, or is it stable?  It seems like it's
stable to me... only thing is that syslog is printing everything to the
console unless tail -f /var/log/messages is run, but that's fine by me.
