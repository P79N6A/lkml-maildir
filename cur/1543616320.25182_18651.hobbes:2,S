We will attempt to port the diet libc to every Linux platform that we
have access to.  I won't go out and buy hardware to port my software to,
so if anyone needs the diet libc ported somewhere, I need an account on
a test box somewhere.
We are currently missing sh-linux, ia64-linux and m68k-linux and
probably a few architectures that I have never heard of ;)
