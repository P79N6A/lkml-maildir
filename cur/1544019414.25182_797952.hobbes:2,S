Well, the _reason_ the byteswap stuff has been interesting to user space 
is that the kernel did it better than the alternatives. Rather than having 
purely "work with big-endian data" (the networking htonl etc functions), 
the kernel had good and fairly optimized handling of various different 
forms of byte order handling.
Which is why people wanted to use it in the first place - and which is why 
then doing just the generic C-based thing doesn't really fix the issue. 
Things may compile, but they kind of lost the point.
