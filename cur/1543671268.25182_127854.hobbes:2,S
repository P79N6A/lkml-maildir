Well the -EIO thing is bogus really, but yes.  The writepage will not hit
disk *at all*.  That's a problem.
We modify i_size in very few places - an alternative might be to maintain a
parallel unsigned long i_size>>PAGE_CACHE_SIZE in the inode and use that in
critical places.  Sounds messy though.
Ho hum.  ugh.
