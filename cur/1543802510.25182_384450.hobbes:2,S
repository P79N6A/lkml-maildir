For what it's worth; when allowing only flawless rips with cdparanoia 
(*) standard cdparanoia 9.8 and the SG_IO patched version of the same 
give me the exact same rips always, on my ATAPI Plextor "PlexWriter 
Premium", a drive that's specifically good at CDDA.
One thing that _is_ different is that the SG_IO version very frequently 
(soft) locks up the machine, with:

Ad infitum. Needless to say, I switched back to regular (unpatched from 
upstream) cdparanoia which doesn't show this problem. The patching I did 
was from this message earlier in this thread:
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=113665002702563&w=2
First I tried with only the .sgio and .labels patches from that src.rpm 
applied, saw the problem, then retried with all of redhat's patches 
applied (just in case) but did not see an improvement.
As said, when things do work, the rips are exactly the same as the rips 
made with the standard cdparanoia.
(*) by "allowing only flawless rips" I mean using "cdparanoia -v -z -B" 
and only ever allowing spaces in the progressbar cdparanoia leaves 
behind as it goes along. When anything else (-, +, !, ...) appears, I 
re-rip the entire track, or the bit in which the error occured, until I 
have a "spaces only" copy. Two of such rips are always the same while on 
the other hand a non-spaces-only rip generally differs from any other 
rip made of that same track.
Rene.
