to capture that trace i did not use -rt, i just patched latest -git 
with:
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/latency-tracing-patches/latency-tracing-v2.6.24-rc3.combo.patch
(this has your fixes included already)
have done:
  echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/mcount_enabled
and have run:
  ./trace-cmd sleep 1 > trace.txt
  
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/latency-tracing-patches/trace-cmd.c
to capture a 1 second trace of what the system is doing. I think your 
troubles are due to running it within a qemu guest - that is not a 
typical utilization so you are on unchartered waters.
