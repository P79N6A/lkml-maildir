I'm not sure either, since qsort doesn't really have much
locality of reference but just walks all over the place.
This is direct contrast with the basic assumption on which
VM and CPU caches are built ;)
I wonder how eg. merge sort would perform ...

The RSS thing is just a side effect of how swap is allocated
and should have little or no influence on which pages are
kept in memory.
One thing which could make 2.4.10 faster for this single case
is the fact that it doesn't keep any page aging info, so IO
clustering won't be confused by the process accessing its
pages ;)
cheers,
Rik
