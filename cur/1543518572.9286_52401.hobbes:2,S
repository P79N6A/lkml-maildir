Nope. You'd need to set up all the locks, even though they aren't
used. This isn't done at present (for bloat and performance reasons).

You can do that today too, as long as they all use essentially the same
kernel. But then you can't tune your kernel to the specific machine you
have. Can't have it both ways.

The real variable here is kernel version, and interfases inside the kernel
_do_ change dramatically during development phases, i.e., inside the
year. Sometimes they change during a stable series too.

Which will probably be a bad idea with 2.4.
