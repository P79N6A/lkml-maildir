The first thing to tackle is making sure a lot of global
things in the system become per-node.
Something like that will increase scalability on various
kinds of hardware while not affecting performance adversely
on other systems.
Other scalability things will have to receive more care
as to not upset existing systems, but I'm sure we'll be
able to get a long way by simply moving things into local
structures...
