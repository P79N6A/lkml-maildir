I noticed the following message at boot:
* The chipset may have PM-Timer Bug. Due to workarounds for a bug,
* this clock source is slow. If you are sure your timer does not have
* this bug, please use "acpi_pm_good" to disable the workaround
Is there any chance that the two issues are connected?
(It seems very unlikely.)
How can I tell whether the bug is fixed in my south bridge or not?
