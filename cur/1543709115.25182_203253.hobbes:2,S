Well, after running whatever patches you supplied for me to test, I 
can confirm after running it for 30 hours, it works a treat - and 
without having any true measuring devices on network performance, I 
can tell you it is very much faster and responsive all round... on 
downloads, web browsing, FTP - everything.  (as you do say, I did 
used to get pauses sometimes during large file movement/downloads 
etc., but just thought it was normal network activity - I do not get 
them any more!).
Insomuchso I have kept this debug 8139too.c build as a running kernel 
now.
Thank you,
Nick
