I believe we are seeing this kind of problems all the time. This is not just a 
kernel 'problem'. Just take a look at the autoconf info page and the tests 
that a portable program has to run.
Of course the makers of (i.e.) glib could just try to find a source tree that 
would compile everywhere but they know that this is impossible so they have 
to run tests like :

I don't believe that your source code is more complex than theirs. Maybe the 
solution to your problem is as simple as 'info autoconf'. You know that there 
are more than one ways to compile kernel modules so you just have to test 
each one of them and see which one works. We're talking about no more than 30 
minutes work. After that you may add another distro in the supported 
distributions list of your module.
