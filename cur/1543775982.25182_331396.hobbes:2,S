Well, looking at your numbers for "silly" and "tosh", which were perhaps
the most extreme examples of slowdown on the /dev/hda thing:
	silly:  22MB/s   -> 8.5MB/s, oread similar    13GB
	tosh:   35MB/s   -> 23MB/s,  oread similar    40GB 2.5"
now it says:

ie here both silly and tosh do equally well on 2.4.x and 2.6.x on reads, 
and seem to perhaps show a bit of slowdown on writes (which I suspect may 
be due to the fact that we try to limit the queues a bit more, but hey, 
that's handwaving).
The point being that the slowdown you see seems to really largely be
limited to the raw partition code. Your filesystem throughput numbers for 
reads are generally _better_ on 2.6.x than on 2.4.x when doing filesystem 
accesses (but the differences aren't all that big).
So my gut feel is that the reason hdparm and dd from the raw partition 
gives different performance is not so much the driver, but probably that 
we've tweaked read-ahead for file access or something like that. Maybe 
the maximum fs-level read-ahead changed?
