 Well, we can advertise by a note the section number or the section
name which contains the real-mode code, but finding the section of
type SHT_PROGBITS having SHF_EXECINSTR flags linked at zero is not
that difficult to do: it is what Gujin does right now when it does
not find the program header linked at zero.

 Gujin loads at the physical address, i.e. kernel is loaded at
0x100000 and not 0xC0100000, is that wrong?
 I am not sure playing these games with addresses is cleaner than
not loading a section which is not in the program header.

 For me the objective is to have a reasonable bootloader,
I will not have the time to port back and test with every other
bootloader some transfert of code from Gujin to an ELF looking
like bzImage file.
