From my standpoint, nothing. Developers knowing it better might disagree.
(It looks a little ugly, but well, it worked last time I tried.)

Do the special formats (entries 9, 12, 13, 16, 17 in floppy.c)
even cost something more than their line in that struct?
>might also want support for the higher capacity formats on the 1440k
Note that I was able to format a floppy with 1680k [21 spt] once under
Linux (including using it). No other OS (including the BIOS) could do
something with it though, and it had to be accessed explicitly through
/dev/fd0u1680. Maybe also the 1760k [22 spt] one, but can't remember.
With regular "1.44M" disks you get in any store, to be noted.
I'm glad to still have a 5.25" drive buried in a 386 [linux 2.6.13] :=)
