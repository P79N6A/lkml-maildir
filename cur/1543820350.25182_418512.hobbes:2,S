Hmmm... regarding VBI_OFFSET there's this:
| - V4L2_(G|S|TRY)_FMT returned incorrect VBI start lines for PAL-M,
|   NTSC-JP, and PAL-60. They also returned an inaccurate VBI offset.
I remember that I tried to figure out how to calculate the VBI offset
from the Bt8xx specs a couple years ago but resigned - somehow the
specs are wrong.  But given a teletext signal and the teletext specs
you can measure its value[1] and 244 is pretty accurate for PAL.
Regarding the 64 bit arithmetic there's this:
| - V4L2_(S|TRY)_FMT did not expect very large or small VBI start or
|   count values, returning wrong (but safe) counts due to an overflow.
Wow, previously the driver produced (safe) garbage when given garbage
and now it produces more accurate (safe) garbage???  I don't get it.

Ciao, ET.
[1] You know that the 7th peak of the teletext clock run-in is at
12us (+0.4us/-1.0us) from the falling hsync.  You look at which
sample the 7th peak is at its max.  The difference between this
number and 12e-6 * Fs (426 for Fs=35468950) is the VBI_OFFSET.
Btw, hsync ends at 166 (PAL/Fs=35468950) respectively 134 (NTSC/
Fs=28636363).  So any VBI_OFFSET lower than that would show the
hsync in the samples...
