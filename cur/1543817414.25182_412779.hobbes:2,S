With a local export/mount I see very few reads running the test  :/
Could this be a timing issue?  That pages in the cache are invalidated
after maybe less than 100 microseconds which is roughly the round-trip
time on the gigabit network connecting my server and client?
/proc/self/mountstats on the two filesystems look identical to me:
device sparrow:/exported/joe mounted on /u/joe with fstype nfs statvers=1.0
opts: rw,vers=3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,acregmin=3,acregmax=60,
      acdirmin=30,acdirmax=60,hard,intr,proto=udp,timeo=7,retrans=3
device localhost:/home/test mounted on /mnt with fstype nfs statvers=1.0
opts: rw,vers=3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,acregmin=3,acregmax=60,
      acdirmin=30,acdirmax=60,hard,intr,proto=udp,timeo=7,retrans=3
