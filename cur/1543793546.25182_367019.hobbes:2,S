Dear Kernel Coders,
I have noticed my Flashmedia based block driver not working properly on FC4. 
ISSUE is: I am not able to format the Block device file using any of the mkfs* commands.
Where as I am able to format the floopy drive.
But, I am able to mount, read/write & dd the device file. 
Udev created the my flashmedia device file with following permission '640'.
I was also successfull in changing the device file permissions to '777' using the the "/etc/udev/rules.d/fm.rules" 
file.
But Still I am not able to format the card and it says: permission denied. 
But, at the same time I have no such issues with the same driver working on the FC3 dist.
I have noticed audit.log being updated with new error "denied" messages whenever I try to format the card. 
Please see the attachment to this mail.
See the logs below as well:
# tail /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep tfa
