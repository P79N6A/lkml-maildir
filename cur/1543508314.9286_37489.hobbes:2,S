Well. I had a quick browse through patch-2.2.11 to look at the vfat
changes, and it seems Al gave Vfat a big revision here with his constant
i-numbers update.
However I couldn't see obvious change in the [acm]time handling,
certainly the bits it vfat_fill_inode() look identical except for
variable naming.
Have you looked at the [acm]time(s) on your vfat partitions to see what
exactly is going wrong/ is different from before.
P'haps that can help narrow the suspect handling down. (Assuming the
change was unintentional).
TTFN    (It's been a long day - so I might give vfat another lookover  
         when I'm truly awake, in case I've missed a blatant & obvious)
