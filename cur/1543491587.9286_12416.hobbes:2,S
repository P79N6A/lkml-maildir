Hi,
First of all thanks for your answer.
I have solved my "always 100%" problem by changing my
bios setup: I have change the default to "maximum power saving"
and the % works again. I still do not understand why the default
stop working ...
About the PS/2 touch pad and apm :
When the machine is AC off-line and I use an X-apm utility, after some times,
the mouse become a little bit crazy: the click effect is 1 cm up that
it should be. I can stop this by suspend and resume or living X
and come back. Note that this happen with or without gpm running. 
I be come "sure" that some apm utility is the cause
of the problem when I used xbatstat : the bad click effect become
exactly when I start this apm utility (and if I suspend and resume
without killing xbatstat then the click effect become more crazy).
IMVHO, these utilities ask the battery status very often (xbatstat very
very often, I thing: I am not able to read the source) and this
give raise to a conflict with the PS/2 touch pad (I have see in
dejanews some messages about conflict between ppp (via the serial
port) and the apm) 
More info:

ls -l /dev/apm_bios /dev/psaux :

crw-rw-rw-   1 root     root      10,   1 mar 31 18:30 /dev/psaux
    
The machine: Compaq presario 1234 (quite similar to the more
popular 1220 and 1240). The bios is a "Pheonix" version 1.2. Here
a cat /proc/apm :
1.9 1.2 0x03 0x00 0x00 0x01 60% -1 ? .
[offtopic] Note also that an apm -S give me the following message:  
Mar 31 20:09:42 snoopy kernel: apm: standby: Unable to enter requested state
and apm -s  do nothing (I can "suspend" with Fn F4 and the machine can
suspend when it have to do !). 
Is this normal ?
Many Thanks again,
Olivier
