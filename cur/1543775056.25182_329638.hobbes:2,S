The threshold for "what belongs in -stable" is a) set too high and b)
over-zealously enforced.

If that's what was in the patch which went into 2.6.13 then we should be OK
with a full backport.  If the person who originally raised that patch put
unrelated things into a single patch then that's where the problem started.
Bear in mind that there is also risk in only part-applying a patch.

But it's obviously safe.
