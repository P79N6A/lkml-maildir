ok, i've been running 2.2.0pre2 for about an hour now...
have noticed only one problem:
fat32 DOS partitions report no free space -- hence,
can't be written to (seems to read fine). i wish i even
knew where to start looking to fix this . . . but i'm still
a dummy :-(
via mvp3 ide chipset
amd k6-2 300
$10 ne2k-pci
attached is my .config
thanks!/hth.

BTW. i've given my box the nightmare memory test --
about 20 netscape windows with large .jpgs while
building a new kernel... swap is acting right!!
-/+ buffers/cache:      94524      33520
Swap:       130748          0     130748
