Unless he really knows what he's doing, no user should use anything 
other than the actual releases (i.e. 2.6.7, 2.6.8, 2.6.9,...).
OSDL does some tests for any -rc and many other people like me do other  
testing. Besides this, most patches already got similar treatment in 
-mm. This might not be a base for an ISO 9000 certificate, but it seems 
to be sufficietely working for finding most problems before the acttual 
release.
It would be more important if Linus would release one last -rc that will 
be released unchanged (except for EXTRAVERSION a few days later to catch 
bugs in last minute changes. This might catch more problems like the JFS 
compile problem in 2.6.7.
