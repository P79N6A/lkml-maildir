The only Hance Rapids stuff I've seen was ICH5-R, but maybe it's carried 
forward to the ICH6-R as well.
I don't know, I mainly know the underlying chipsets not the boards they 
wind up being shipped on...

Coming RSN.  That's my next priority, but I'm not as thrilled because 
Marvell isn't an open design like AHCI.  I'm much more happy to promote 
AHCI's sane, open design.
