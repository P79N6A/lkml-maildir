I have a Pacific Digital qstor card on irq 193. I am using kernel
2.6.17.13 SMP
The error happens every now and then. I have not been able to
figure out any triggers and I can not reproduce it on demand. Today
it happened 3 times within a 40 minutes period. 
All disks connected to the card are disabled and I can't do anything
other than a reboot to get them back.
It is reported as follows:
irq 193: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)

Disabling IRQ #193
The PCI info for the card is:

This is really creating problems for me now. If anybody knows
of a dumb (ie. non-raid) PCI SATA card with 8 ports with good
Linux support for a couple hundred backs I would appreciate
it.
If there is any other info that I should provide to help 
troubleshoot please let me know.
Thanks,
Alberto
