No. He called us close-minded idiots in his posting that he sent to the
list. Coming over with an attitude like that won't help his case with us.
And we did suggest some solutions but he seems unwilling to implement. As
Linus says, if you don't like it the way he does things, you can fix it.
That precisely is the point he doesn't seem to get. Eight years' of
experience and he doesn't get it? HAHA.
All he has to do (as someone suggested), download the sources and turn
it into a some form of a "BabyLinux" source tree specificially for his
requirements. Then he can build it. 40MB is sufficent if you're only
building the i386 portion of the sources.
Cheers,
Alex
