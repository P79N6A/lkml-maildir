One or the other of these is missing a -0x100 for the location...
void foo (int len1, unsigned int len2)
{
  char bar[0x100];
  char baz[len1];
  char quux[len2];
  char moby[8];
}
And moby[6] is *where*? ;)  Bonus points for getting this right if
compiled with -fvomit-stack-pointer. <evil grin> ;)
