Subject: [PATCH][SPARSE] Use $(CC) consistently throughout the Makefile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/7/149

This patch makes compilation of sparse use the correct version of gcc
throughout.  (It doesn't seem to have caused any problems, but the
current situation isn't strictly correct, so...)
