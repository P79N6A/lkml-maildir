Hi,
[this is not only a reply to Thomas' mail, but also an update about the
current state of my vendor RAID support]
Greg: Would you accept this patch into your udev package?

Partly solved, check below.

I got a mail from Barlomiej Zolnierkiewicz where he suggested to split the
vendor dependent code out of raiddetect.c. This will happen in one of the
next revisions.
>>- People checking the numerous FIXMEs
I now have the following FIXMEs (aka "I have no idea about it"):
- 5 FIXMEs in the Medley RAID code. Thomas, could you comment once you're
back?
- 3 FIXMEs in the Highpoint RAID code. Wilfried, could you please take a
look at them?
- 2 FIXMEs in the Promise RAID code. I will on those myself.
- some generic FIXMEs:
  - Is the sector size of a harddisk always 512 bytes?
  - Is /sys/block/*/size always in 512-byte units?
  - Are there controllers out there which occupy more than one PCI device?
  - How can I find out if a block device under /sys/block is a disk?

Wilfried, is there any consistency check I can add for Highpoint?

This is still a _big issue_.

Thanks!

Changed.

medley_sb_helper now has a parameter ignore_vendorid (default off).

Will be added as soon as I get the data.

Will be added once I have more info about the expected checksum value for
different superblock versions (see FIXME there).

The chunk_size>0 check is now in. Can I do better chunk_size checking?

Done.

Attached is my current version of raiddetect.
