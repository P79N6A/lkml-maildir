Looks like the order of your file partitions (or labels) got
changed between kernel versions so that your 'slices' are not
being mounted.
do `df` to see what got mounted. Try to mount the other paritions,
first under /mnt, then later at there correct place after to
inspect them under /mnt to see which is which.
After you have it all sorted out, change the entries in
/etc/fstab to be correct for the next boot.
