Hi,
I have an ABIT BP6 mobo with 2 celeron 400 running redhat 7.1 with 2.4.3
SMP (from kernel.org not from redhat)
it works well.
But when i try to update my kernel, i always get a lockups in few
minutes. sometimes kernel just freeze when booting.
I have tried other kernel such as 2.4.5, 2.4.6 and 2.4.7 and I always
get the same result.
but if i compile a non SMP kernel the box is stable.
Is it a know problem ?
are there a work around ?
thanks
