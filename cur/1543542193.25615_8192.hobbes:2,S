For quite a long time now in these pre-2.4.x kernels I've noticed
problems with DMA.  Particularly with my cdrom, which is a Kenwood
52x TrueX ide drive. This is the info /proc gives me as detected by
linux.

Now, I understand this cdrom is not a standard cdrom, so it may be using
non-standard DMA, but if that is so, then why when using hdparm, my
hdd's will also be finicky with DMA.  I dont have any exact logs that
show what is really going on except of course the atapi driver puts my
cdrom in an infinite reset loop.  It would be nice if I could force it
to stop doing that ... even if it means making the cdrom not accessible
because all it seems to do is increase load depending on what was
accessing it when the loop began.  I usually have to turn the dma off on
the cdrom to get anything to access it now, although for some reason it
just stopped reading with 2.4.0-test7-pre7 ..it has power, but it wont
respond. Any help will be appreciated, I'm at a loss to explain what is
wrong. I was only aware of DMA problems on other non-standard
motherboards, this is a genuine intel 440LX .

    ALL the DMA options regarding "Use as default when available" and
"good bad firmware"

option )

The Cdrom is detected as "DMA" on boot but I turned it off with hdparm
because of the problems I mentioned before. The cdrom is supposed to be
UDMA2 like the other drives though (that's what the box said)
After looking in /proc/sys/dev/cdrom   i set the "lock" file to 0
instead of 1, thinking maybe it was wrongfully locked and that's why it
wasn't responding ...but that didn't help so i set "debug' file to 1
and  tried to eject the disc using the eject command
cdrom: entering CDROMEJECT
cdrom: entering cdrom_release
cdrom: Use count for "/dev/hdc" now zero
cdrom: Unlocking door!
....obviously the kernel knows something I don't, because the door is
still shut and the led didn't even light up.
so I tried mounting it  and this is what I get
cdrom: entering cdrom_open
cdrom: entering open_for_data
cdrom: drive_status=4
cdrom: entering cdrom_count_tracks
ATAPI device hdc:
  Error: Not ready -- (Sense key=0x02)

  The failed "Read Table of Contents" packet command was:
  "43 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 "
cdrom: wrong media type, but CDO_CHECK_TYPE not set.
cdrom: all seems well, opening the device.
cdrom: opening the device gave me 0.

and that repeats until mount timeouts and gives up.   If there is any
other info needed to figure this out tell me and I'll get it.  Thanks in
advance.
