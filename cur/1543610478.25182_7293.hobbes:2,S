In theory.  Again, as a workaround - sync before umount (and don't boot
unpatched 2.4.15/2.4.15-pre9 again, obviously).
Breakage happens when you umount filesystem (_any_ local filesystem, be
it ext2, reiserfs, whatever) that still has dirty inodes.
IOW, if you are running 2.4.15 - build a patched kernel, install it and
do the following:
	* switch to single-user
	* sync
	* umount everything non-buys
	* remount the rest read-only
	* turn the thing off
	* boot with patched kernel or with anything before 2.4.15-pre9
