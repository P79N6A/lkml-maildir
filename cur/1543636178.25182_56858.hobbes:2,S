Define a node as a group of CPUs with the same set of latencies to memory.
Then you get something that makes sense for everyone, and reduces the 
storage of duplicated data. If your latencies for each CPU are different, 
define a 1-1 mapping between nodes and CPUs. If you really want to store
everthing for each CPU, that's fine.

I can't help thinking that we'd be better off making the mechanism as generic
as possible, and not trying to predict all the wierd and wonderful things people
might want to do (eg striping), then implement what you describe as a policy 
decision.
