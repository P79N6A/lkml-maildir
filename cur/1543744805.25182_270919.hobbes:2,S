Looks like an old harddisk that does not understand an IDE command.

Do you think that's normal? I can come up in less than 60 secs. (80x25), so I
presume boting X does not take much more time than 3 minutes.
What do you mean by "last"? Does the error message stay there and the box is
like, idle? No other stuff scrolling through?

Well, error message there or not -- I suspect it to be the hard disk.
Take it out (i.e. remove IDE cable) and reboot Linux.
If it takes the same amount of time to bootup, the hard disk is probably fine.
Ignore the warnings then.
