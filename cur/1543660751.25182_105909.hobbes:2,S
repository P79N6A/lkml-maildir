Subject: OOPS in read_cd... what to do?

I reported twice (Jan 15 the last time) to this list a kernel oops when
reading a CD in a SONY CDU-31A unit with kernels 2.4.18 - 2.4.20 (and
probably all the 2.4 series), which works fine on 2.2.x (and even
1.2.x!!), maybe the maintainer of this part os the code is offline... Are
there any alternatives to fix this problem? Thank you.
