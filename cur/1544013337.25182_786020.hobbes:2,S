if by "pollute the name space" you mean "it'll be defined where it normally 
wasnt before", then yes.  it's always been in the header, just behind 
__KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES.  i also highlight the fact that existing headers that 
are exported to userspace are already using this type, so they're broken most 
of the time today.
unless you want a completely new patch that deletes aligned_*64 types and 
replaces them with __aligned_*64 types ...
