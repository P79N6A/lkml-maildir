And I still think that is probably the best strategy for e2compr, as it
avoids arguments with Ted! But if Ted is also of the opinion that
e2compr is currently stable, and I believe he is, and is willing to
moderate incorporation into ext2, AIBHI, then the way is open to
Riley going forward with the merging.
