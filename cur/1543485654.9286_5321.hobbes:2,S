Hi there.
Here's an update to my previous announcement, confirming the details
in the web page...
I now have my own cd-writer, and have split the currently known
kernels onto CD's. They currently split into three volumes, as
follows:
 1. Volume 1.
	All 0.* series kernels.
	All 1.* series kernels.
	2.0 through 2.0.14 inclusive.
	All patch files for the same.
 2. Volume 2.
	2.0.10 through 2.0.33 inclusive.
	2.1.0 through 2.1.83 inclusive.
	All patch files for the same.
 3. Volume 3.
	2.0.33 through 2.0.36 inclusive.
	2.1.83 through 2.1.132 inclusive.
	2.2.0-pre1 through 2.2.0-pre9 inclusive.
	2.2.0 and 2.2.1
	All patch files for the same.
In addition, volume 3 has room for an estimated further 6 kernel
tarballs and associated patch files - and before anybody asks, the
overlap between volumes 1 and 2 in the 2.0 series kernels is to allow
for the inclusion of further 0.* series kernels, currently missing
from the collection, as they turn up. Those missing kernels are as
follows - and if anybody knows where any of them are, please advise
me:
	0.02		0.95a.1		0.96a.1
	0.03		0.95a.2		0.96a.2 *
					0.96a.3 *
	0.99.13a	0.99.13l	0.96a.4 *
	0.99.13b	0.99.13m
	0.99.13c	0.99.13n
	0.99.13d	0.99.13o
	0.99.13e	0.99.13p
	0.99.13f	0.99.13q
	0.99.13g	0.99.13r
	0.99.13h	0.99.13s
	0.99.13i	0.99.13t
	0.99.13j
The three marked with asterisks are ones for which I have patch files,
but no valid kernel tarball to apply those patch files to. However,
the patch files in question are included in Volume 1.
If anybody would like copies of these CD's, please email me privately,
as suchlike is not appropriate on here. Following investigation of
postage rates with the post office, I will be charging the following
for volumes 1 and 2 combined, supplied in a dual CD jewel case:
	UK		£10.00
	Europe		£13.00
	Worldwide	£14.00
Please note that volume 3 is NOT on offer just yet, but will follow at
a later date...
Linus: If you would like a set, just ask - in my opinion, you've done
more than enough to deserve a set, so your set would be free...
Best wishes from Riley.
