In a 512 MB dual p3 machine I got this: (hackbench 100)
2.4.26: Time: 38.123
2.6.9-rc2-mm1: Time: 19.505
BTW, in the 2.6 case the kernel didn't have a very nice behaviour: A couple of
seconds after starting hackbench(after doing the benchmarks), Xorg stopped
running until hackbench finished. X was using nice 0.
