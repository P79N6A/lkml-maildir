One subtlety here...
The traversals that are protected by rcu_read_lock() (rather than an
update-side spinlock) need to be list_for_each_entry_rcu() rather than
list_for_each_entry().  The "_rcu()" is required in order to work
reliably on Alpha, and has the added benefit of calling out exactly
which traversals are RCU-protected.
Update-side code remains list_for_each_entry().

What happens when you have two consecutive updates to the same object?
Don't you have to defer the second update until a grace period has
elapsed since the first update in order to avoid confusing readers that
are still accessing the original version?
One way to do this would be to set a "don't-touch-me" bit that is
cleared by an RCU callback.  An update to an element with the
"don't-touch-me" bit set would block until the bit clears.  There
are probably better ways...
