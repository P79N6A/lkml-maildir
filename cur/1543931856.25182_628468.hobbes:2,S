Markus,
i've applied the first 4 patches to x86.git.
another detail: shouldnt this be structured so that the APIs are 
introduced in kernel/ptrace.c, and that the architecture offers the 
mechanism. (which would thus be ptrace-independent) This would also open 
these APIs up to kernel-internal use and to be used by other 
architectures.
