Hi.
> This patch makes yield() actually call schedule.
The trouble hanging after "Initializing RT netlink socket" which
several report, just gone.  And seems to work fine.
But I wonder whether doing schedule() here is good or not.  In 2.5,
schedule() is done in sys_sched_yield().  I don't know much about
kernel things.  So I just compared...
