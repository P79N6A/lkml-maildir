Thanks a lot for doing this!  Our backups run every other night and
usually write 15-20GB to tape, and it was 2 weeks before we hit this.
So it's not very easy to reproduce.  They ran again last night (with the
patch) without incident.
There's one more thing that might be interesting: the morning before
this crash happened, this machine mysteriously rebooted for no apparent
reason.  There was nothing in the logs.  Unfortunately, the BIOS screen
wipes out the last ~24 lines of serial console output on reboot, so all
I can say is that if anything was printed it was much less than 24
lines.  There are other machines on the same UPS so it wasn't a power
glitch.  And it had just had an uptime of 170-some days with 2.6.11.3
(which had some annoying bugs but was stable), so it's not exactly prone
to random reboots...
I didn't think it was worth mentioning since I knew nothing about what
happened, but I noticed that it happened exactly one hour after the
6:37am cron job (updatedb etc.) - the same one that caused it to crash
the next day after the oopses during the backups.  Might it be related?
Let me know if there's any more info I can provide.
