2.4 kernels have a little check which prevents a single process from
mlocking more than half of physical memory.  So you need to run two
processes to kill a 2.4 box with mlock.
Some people want to be able to mlock more memory than that in a single
process, so the check was removed in 2.6.  It was pretty pointless.
