Well, it happens almost everyday when I come back to work
and wake my laptop up from sleep and starts receiving ntp packets
(broadcastclient mode). After a few minutes, I have a time adjustment
step of of typically a few hundred milliseconds either way. It's a
once per day event, but it happens.
But anyway, I understand your point. But by doing this you potentially 
cause another problem of fairly large steps in time for interrupt handlers 
that do timestamping.
Consider the following:
- t-2: interrupt A arrives and starts being serviced
- t-1: interrupt B arrives but delayed in the APIC
- t: timer interrupt arrives (it is delayed too)
- t+x1: return from interrupt A
- t+x2: interrupt B serviced
- gettimeofday for time stamping, the returned value will actually 
  be frozen at t-1 for HZ=1000 or t-5 for HZ=100, while the actual
  time is t+something with something maybe up to a few tens of
  microseconds, instead of t+x2-1 or t+x2-5 which would be 
  clearly better.
- t+x3: timer interrupt, time steps suddenly now (or in
  the following BH, can't remember) from t-1 to the correct
  value, creating a fairly large discontinuity.
So what I'm asking you is to change the code so that the discontinuities
are minimized. That's quite important for some applications; actually
in my case the out-of-order gettimeofday don't matter as long as the
steps are small because I don't sample fast enough to be affected
by them, but getting the timestamp wrong by tens of microseconds is bad 
for evaluating the derivatives of the value read from a position encoder, 
as needed for servo loops for example.

If we are really losing clock interrupts, we have more serious problems 
anyway (on x86 with classical 8253 timer, I don't know about other x86 
systems, only that PPC recovers from them rather well). This misnamed 
lost_jiffies variable is not the number of lost interrupts, but actually 
the number of jiffies for which the bottom half has not (yet) been 
performed.

Still unhappy...
