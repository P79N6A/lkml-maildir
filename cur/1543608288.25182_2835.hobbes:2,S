Hallo l-k,
the first: I'm very sorry for old post about PCMCIA: function
yenta_config_init() is called the first time from yenta_open()
and not from yenta_init(), as I think... It was my error...
I explored yenta.c through printk() function and I found the last
point, where kernel freeze: This point is here:
--- function yenta_open_bh() from drivers/pcmcia/yenta.c
/*
 * 'Bottom half' for the yenta_open routine. Allocate the interrupt line
 *  and register the socket with the upper layers.
 */
static void yenta_open_bh(void * data)
{
	pci_socket_t * socket = (pci_socket_t *) data;
	/* It's OK to overwrite this now */
	socket->tq_task.routine = yenta_bh;
	printk("yenta_open_bh: socket->tq_task.routine\n");
	if (!socket->cb_irq || request_irq(socket->cb_irq, yenta_interrupt, (SA_SHIRQ | SA_INTERRUPT), socket->dev->name, socket)) {
		/* No IRQ or request_irq failed. Poll */
		printk("yenta_open_bh: in the if block\n");
		socket->cb_irq = 0; /* But zero is a valid IRQ number. */
		socket->poll_timer.function = yenta_interrupt_wrapper;
		socket->poll_timer.data = (unsigned long)socket;
		socket->poll_timer.expires = jiffies + HZ;
		printk("yenta_open_bh: before add_timer\n");
		add_timer(&socket->poll_timer);
		printk("yenta_open_bh: add_timer\n");
	}
	printk("yenta_open_bh: after if(!socket->cb_irq...\n");
	/* Figure out what the dang thing can do for the PCMCIA layer... */
	yenta_get_socket_capabilities(socket, isa_interrupts);
	printk("yenta_open_bh: after yenta_get_socket_capabilities\n");
	printk("Socket status: %08x\n", cb_readl(socket, CB_SOCKET_STATE));
	/* Register it with the pcmcia layer.. */
	cardbus_register(socket);
	printk("yenta_open_bh: cardbus_register()\n");
	MOD_DEC_USE_COUNT; 
}
--- end of function
Last message from kernel is:
yenta_open_bh: socket->tq_task.routine
Then I mean, that problem is in the calling of request_irq(). As
you see, I tried call this function with flags (SA_SHIRQ |
SA_INTERRUPT), but this is not the right way too...
I wrote, that my Compaq has IRQ 11 shared between PCMCIA
controller and VGA card...
Please, can you cc any follow-ups to me? Thank you very much...
Sincerely
Jan Marek
