   This defines a help text. The end of the help text is determined by
   the indentation level, this means it ends at the first line which has
   a smaller indentation than the first line of the help text.
+  You may also use dashes around the word help to assist in the visual
+  separation of help from configuration. e.g. '--help--' or '---help---'.
+  These dashes have no effect on functionality, they are purely decorative.
