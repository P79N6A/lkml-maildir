Here is an article with detailed explanation of that USB issue:
 
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/250635
The most interesting fact there is that windows *does not* clear
PCI_COMMAND_MEMORY bits during PCI bus enumeration, so BIOS writers
have to rely on that. Yet another reason why your patch is unsafe.

I don't think so. This can only be done in USB driver, which cannot run
before PCI device discovery.

I have suggested a *practical* solution that disables the decode only
when it's unavoidable. If it's not sufficient for some machines, it
can be extended quite easily.

Again, it's impossible with AGP or PCI-E cards, which are always separated
from the root bus by AGP or PCI-E bridge. The bridge does decode in the
first place, so when you write the BAR with all ones, you move it outside
the bridge decoding window. Address collision isn't possible in this
case in principle.

Another possible solution is not to use mmconfig for bar sizing at all,
if it's *that* broken. It would be more complicated though, since it
probably requires changes to all architectures.
