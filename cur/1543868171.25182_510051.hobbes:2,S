Here is the point, I think. I'm afraid that you don't really access
any *real* partition. If it were so, that partition would have an
identifying *device* name. You access something within an image for an
emulating program that you interpret as a partition but not the
kernel. So it cannot access the superblock of it in its buffer and
recover bh->b_size to go on properly. It recovers something else. And
this triggers the oops.
