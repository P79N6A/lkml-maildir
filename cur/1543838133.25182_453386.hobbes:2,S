Hello !
I'm trying to compile my own kernel for drivers on two computers, but 
that fails. A the boot, I have this error :
kernel panic - not syncing: VFS Unable to mount root fs on unknow-block 
(3.69)
I'm using the kernel 2.6.19 with Ubuntu Dapper. I use the old boot 
config and I type make oldconfig, so I don't understand why there are an 
error with the near same configuration.
I suppose that I must compile not in module but in hard support for my 
IDE chipset, harddisk and file system. Probably, I don't understand how 
do exactly. I do that :
lspci |grep IDE
0000:00:11.1 IDE interface: VIA Technologies, Inc. 
VT82C586A/B/VT82C686/A/B/VT823x/A/C PIPC Bus Master IDE (rev 06)
make xconfig

Thanks very much,
Thibaud.
