OK, I'll try, but there should be many references and explanations to it
on the internet already (did you look?).
If the current task is running and thus not yet exiting (!current->exit_state)
and is also in an atomic code section (i.e. under lock), it shouldn't call
any reschedule function (which also happens by just calling msleep(): use
mdelay() instead in that case!).
Generally spoken you should leave locked code sections ASAP (don't waste
too much time in there), and not call any functions that schedule to the
next task in there (msleep(), ...).
BTW, the code above is an old unoptimized version, fixed by me recently.
