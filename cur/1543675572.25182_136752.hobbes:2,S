That is my understanding too.

Actually there is, at least in 2.4.  Whenever kernel calls get_user_pages()
it maps a user page into kernel virtual address space.  If kernel modifies
that page, flush_dcache_page() needs to make sure any stale cache data
at user virtual address is flush in order user to see kernel changes.
I have a test case at 
	
http://linux.junsun.net/test-programs
(Note, sometimes even if you pass the test, you _may_ still have a wrong
flush_dcache_page() implementation, because stale cache could be flushed 
due to other execution sequences)
I took a brief look of 2.5 code.  It seems this problem should still
exist (of course, assuming the CPU has cache aliasing problem and the
flush_dcache_page() is not properly implemented).  
Actually in 2.5 you may fail the test even if you have a properly implemented
flush_dcache_page().  It appears it lacks another flush_dcache_page()
after the direct_IO is done.  I don't have a working 2.5 on MIPS.  Can't 
verify that.
