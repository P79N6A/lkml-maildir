Hi,
The following patchset completes the basic functionality on 
kexec based crashdumps on i386. The first patch makes it 
possible to boot an i386 kernel from a non-default physical 
address. The rest of the patches are minor clean-ups and 
bug-fixes.
All the patches are on top of 2.6.9-rc4-mm1.
Kindly review them and let us know your feedback.
Thanks and Regards,
Hari
