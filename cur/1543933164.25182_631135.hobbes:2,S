Actually, to the contrary, I actually think Christoph responds to
every problem I've ever reported to him about his per-cpu counters
work and SLUB much better than most people who call themselves
"maintainers" around here.
And I say that without any reservations.
He doesn't deserve the ad-hominem attacks he is getting today, because
he does resolve every problem reported to him.
The guy wrote test cases, he analyzed every problem, he wrote test
patches, and he doesn't stop doing any of that until the issue really
is reported as resolved by the testers.
I'll take Christoph as the implementor and maintainer of anything, any
day of the week.  He rocks.
