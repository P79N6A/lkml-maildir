Hello
We have a system with 2 CF-disks connected 
directly to the IDE-controller (PIIX4). We 
used before the "old" IDE-driver hd.c and it 
worked fine, until we had to use a larger 
disk (1.5GB). Then we disabled hd.c, and 
appended hdb=flash. Then initially at boot 
both drives are identified:
PIIX4: IDE controller...
PIIX4 chipset revision 1
PIIX4: not 100% native mode...
    ide0: BM-DMA at...
hda: Hitachi...
hdb: ...
ide0 at...
hdb: 31488 sectors (16MB)...
Partition check:
 hdb: hdb1
...
And that's it. hda never appears again. And 
what is also strange, the order of hda/b is
swapped, compared to the old hd.c driver and
to BIOS settings. What's the reason for this 
behaviour and how do we fix it?
Thanks
Guennadi
