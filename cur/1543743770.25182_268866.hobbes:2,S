i have released the -V0.7.18 Real-Time Preemption patch, which can be
downloaded from:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
this release includes fixes and cleanups.
Changes between -V0.7.12 and -V0.7.18:
 - merged to 2.6.10-rc1-mm3
 - fixed the e1000 xmit warnings reported by Amit Shah. Same fix for tg3
   too.
 - added irq-latency fix from Thomas Gleixner: re-enable interrupts
   before adding timings to the entropy pool.
 - fixed excessive ksoftirqd overhead during outgoing TCP traffic. 
   ksoftirqd kept getting re-woken while it had no way to progress.
 - added upstream fix from Andi Kleen for the vmalloc bug causing module
   load problems/crashes. Added ipc/shm fix too.
Changes between -V0.7.1 and -V0.7.12:
 - big source level cleanups: completely rearranged the mutex type
   definitions and source files, to make it reflect the code. Made
   all locking objects based on a new, central lock type: struct
   rt_mutex. This type is never exposed externally, it is internal to
   the RT code. Unified all the RT locking code in kernel/rt.c, this 
   also simplified and sped things up. Undid collateral damage to the
   generic rwsem code - it is now untouched and independent of the RT
   code.
 - rearranged the way spinlocks interact with the RT code and cleaned 
   up the RT spinlock definitions. Found and fixed a bug in the process:
   rwlocks were dropping the BKL upon contention.
 - small x86 speedup: call __schedule not preempt_schedule_irq from
   work_resched.
 - ported PREEMPT_RT to x64. This resulted in the generalization of some
   of the x86 changes.
 - hopefully fixed fbcon kernel logging
 - hacked reiser4 to make it work on PREEMPT_REALTIME.
 - dropped the swap-layout-improvements patch. While it was working fine 
   it's not necessary for latencies anymore under the PREEMPT_REALTIME
   approach, and the swap-patch was getting intrusive.
 - fixed preemption-bug in drain_cpu_caches() on SMP [bug introduced by
   PREEMPT_REALTIME]
 - new attempt at getting rid of the networking related deadlocks
 - selinux deadlock fix and RCU-code conversion to RT semantics
to create a -V0.7.18 tree from scratch, the patching order is:
