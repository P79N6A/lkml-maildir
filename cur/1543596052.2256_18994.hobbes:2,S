The person at the console on a nonnetworked machine
can make life difficult for himself in a great variety of ways.
(E.g., try running
  #include <signal.h>
  main(){int i;for(i=1; i<32; i++)signal(i,SIG_IGN); while(1);}
on all VTs.)
It would not increase security when root privileges were needed
in all such cases.
