get_mempolicy only works from inside the thread that is executing. This 
means all applications would need some specialized library to dump the 
memory allocation information and you would need some external means of 
triggering the dump of node information.
The other methods via numastat gives aggregate values that not useful at 
all if multiple processes are running. Yes, on a bare machine with one 
process running one could determine the memory allocated by searching 
through all nodes in order to guess where the memory was allocated (try 
that on a box with hundreds of nodes!).
However, one still does not know which memory section (vma) is allocated 
on which nodes. And this may be important since critical data may need to 
be interleaved whereas other massive amounts of data may be organized in a 
different way.

Cross node traffic is not the same as memory use. Performance counters are 
a debugging feature, they are complex to manage and only available in a 
limited way.  Its also not trivial figuring out a way to trigger these 
counters in order to get the data.

It does not open those doors since the modification of memory policies is 
still not possible (IMHO this is one element of a series of problematic 
"features" in the policy layer).
External memory policy management is a necessary feature for system 
administration, batch process scheduling as well as for testing and 
debugging a system.
