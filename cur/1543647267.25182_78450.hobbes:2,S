Well, we all find some things more ridiculous than others, but...
The kernel would still have the text-mode configurator.
This only applies to the GUI kernel config.
So you wouldn't have to download the kernel config unless you just
wanted that oh-so-pretty GUI to config it.
[rhetorical question:]
So should it be shipped with a full Qt development environment, e.g.?
