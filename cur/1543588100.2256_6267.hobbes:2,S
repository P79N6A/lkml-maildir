Exactly. A ChangeLog should pre preserved for all time. It is an
incredibly useful tool. Many times I've gone back and checked when
something was done, and in relation to other changes before, after or
around the same time.

Except the CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE was in the apm.c source
file (in a ChangeLog). So just ignoring Documentation/ won't solve the
problem.
One trick I've used on my own (non-Linux) code is to insert a space
after the first underscore. That fools the global search, but leaves
the essence of the ChangeLog entry. It's a bit hackish, though.
A cleaner solution is to parse the source code, ignoring comment
blocks. However, that's a bit more work.
Either way, the solution adopted has to kill off the false
positives. It's not good enough to build up a list of CONFIG options
to ignore, as it will get stale. Furthermore, that list might be
overlooked by someone on a cleanup crusade, with the result that a
patch gets sent to Linus which "fixes" the "broken" CONFIG symbols.
And since too many global patches are not Cc'ed to the maintainers,
this kind of crap slips by.
Frankly, I'd rather see stale symbols left around, and have it really
difficult to detect them. Eric is making a tool that makes it too easy
for a random person to "detect" "problems" and then "fix" them,
thinking that "progess" is being made. In reality, it's just regress.
