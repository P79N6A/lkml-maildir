It would be ideal from the memory allocator's point of view to do it
on a per-request basis like that.
When the rubber hits the road, I think it is probably going to be very
troublesome to do it right that way. For example, what happens when
your usb-thingy-thread blocks on a memory allocation while handling a
read request, then the system gets low on memory and someone tries to
free some by submitting a write request to the USB device?
I don't know anything about how the usb thread works so I'm not sure.
The mempool model seems to work well for requests in the block layer -
making a completely uneducated guess I'd say that could be a good
option to investigate.
