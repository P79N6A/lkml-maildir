Hi!
I think it should be possible to make the ICH2 and ICH3 Intel chips
(82801BA and 82801CA) do UDMA133. (Intel only says they can do UDMA100).
If anyone running a 2.5 kernel with an Intel mainboard with one of those
chips and a UDMA133 capable harddrive is willing to test this, please
contact me, I'll give you a patch.
