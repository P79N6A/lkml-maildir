Hello all,
 I just got a new machine in production as a web server and I am getting 
lots of "hw tcp v4 csum failed" about 1 a min.  Have tryed 2.4.20 and 
2.4.21pre3. I have another idental machine running with out this issue.
from dmesg
tg3.c:v1.2a (Dec 9, 2002)
eth0: Tigon3 [partno(TBD) rev 1002 PHY(5703)] (PCIX:100MHz:64-bit) 
10/100/1000BaseT Ethernet from /proc/pci
  Bus  2, device   1, function  0:
    Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5703X Gigabit 
Ethernet (rev 2).
      IRQ 11.
      Master Capable.  Latency=64.  Min Gnt=64.
      Non-prefetchable 64 bit memory at 0xf7ef0000 [0xf7efffff].
This sounds very bad can some one explane what it means and how to get 
rid of it. Also could it be caused by bad arp cache?
Thanks
Byron
