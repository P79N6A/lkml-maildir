There's not much to wonder about here, the basic idea of devfs is a good
one which is why udev was written. The problems expressed on lkml about
devfs were with that specifically implementation, if a better
implementation had been merged originally udev might have never been
created. I really doubt FreeBSD took the Linux devfs code and integrated it
with their kernel, so the fact that FreeBSD is using a devfs now simply
means they like the idea of a dynamic /dev as well.
