  Yes.

 I did not merge them because most other things in file_ra_state are in
pages and thus comparisons and assignments would require additional
shifts, which would IMHO make the whole thing less clear.

  prev_page is a member of the file_ra_state. Probably prev_index would be
better name there...

  It's clearer but wrong, as Wu already noted :). But the assignment
prev_index = index
  can be shifted somewhat lower (definitely after the comment) which makes
things slightly more readable.

  I vote for prev_index and 'offset' could be prev_offset. I'll create a
tidy-up patch...
