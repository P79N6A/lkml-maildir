So put the translation of 32 bits rdev to 32:32 in the NFS client.
Provide a mount-time option "rdev-encoding=14:18", with symbolic
names for often-used encodings: "rdev-encoding=solaris". Done.
You can do this on the NFS server side as well.. per-client,
even.  If anyone still cares for NFSv2, that is.
Same goes for other filesystems, though a dynamic translation will
not be nessecary. But the filesystem driver itself
must convert from native rdev to linux 32:32.
