How do you determine the polling rate?  I take it that this is a different
patch than Ingo's?

Are you sure they are "bugs" and not dropped packets?  It seems to me that
RX-ERR == RX-DRP, which would seem to me that the receive buffers are full
on the card and are not being emptied quickly enough (or maybe that is
indicated by RX-OVR...)  I don't know whether it is _possible_ to empty
the buffers quickly enough, I suppose CPU usage info would also shed some
light on that.
Cheers, Andreas
