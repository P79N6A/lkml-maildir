My laptop harddrive is only a little over a year old and it has a cycle 
count of 193 Load_Cycle_Count        0x0012   021   021   000    
Old_age   Always       -       795931
it was going up a few counts everytime I ran the smartctl -A command. It 
quit incrementing after
I did the hdparm -B 255 command.
