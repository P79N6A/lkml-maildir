The SCCS rules is the sole reason why -rR has not been enabled.
In my inbox I have a patch that enables SCCS support for all files.
Today it fails for Kconfig files at least.
I'm willing to give it a try. But we will only see people complaining
when it hits linus tree. -mm users uses quilt and the like - and thus
will not be hit by this.
