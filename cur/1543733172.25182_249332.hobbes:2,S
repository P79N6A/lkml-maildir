Ok, I can change so I don't have to take ownership of the bridge from
the PCI driver so there isn't a conflict.  "Intel ICH Joystick" is a
deceptive name for this driver. It should be named something like "LPC
bridge" since there are other things on that device than the joystick.
Why does just the joystick need a special driver and nothing else on
that bridge needs one? Wouldn't PS/2, serial, parallel, etc all have
this problem?
"Intel ICH" is also a bad driver name. I'd prefer something like
"snd_intel8x0" since that is what the module is named.

I was thinking about this from the probing side. You can't count on
midi and joystick ports having PCI IDs so you have to manually probe.
But I also see how a card with a PCI ID could have these ports on it
and also include logic for turning them off and on.
