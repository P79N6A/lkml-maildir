Are you sure the cmpxchg8b need a lock prefix? Sure it does to
get the proper "atomic cmpxchg" semantics, but what about a
simple 64-bit store... If it boils down to 8 byte load, 8 byte
store on the memory bus, and that store is atomic, then maybe
a lock isn't needed at all?
I think when emulating a *load*, then the lock is needed, because
otherwise the subsequent store may overwrite some value that has
just been stored by another processor.... but for a store I'm not
so sure.

Yes. In this case (include/asm-i386/system.h:__set_64bit), it
is using lowercase lock, which I think is not defined away,
right?
