we could do this for the speedtouch - in fact we used to do this: when
someone tried to open a connection, we loaded the firmware if it hadn't
been loaded yet.  The problem is with other modems, like the connexant
access runner, for which you can't get all the info needed to create
an ATM device before the firmware is loaded (the MAC address for example).
