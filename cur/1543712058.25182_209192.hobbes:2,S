Is there an easy way to find out what /dev entries usb devices get 
mapped to from userspace? Specifically mice since the /dev location 
isn't even printed in dmesg.
I have a program that needs to open each mouse independently so 
/dev/input/mice isn't an option.
I'm also on a 2.4 kernel so sysfs/udev is not available.
Thanks.
