The idea not to change the self_exec_id seems to be the more general 
solution: less work in the loop in the forget_original_parent function 
and only changes in do_notify_parent kernel/signal.c are required:
One could check for tsk->p_pptr/parent == child_reaper and force a SIGCHLD
in this case. Changes in the self_exec_id because of exec's are 
catched by the code in exit_notify already.
The difference between self_exec_id and parent_exec_id would become 
a real exec counter.
