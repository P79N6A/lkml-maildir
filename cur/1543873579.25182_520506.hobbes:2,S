Would this explain why recent version of GDM don't find the keyboard
properly when you boot with a kernel command line of:
   kernel ... console=tty0 console=ttyS1,96008N1
until you stop and restart GDM?  This was filed under Debian bug
#406457 (see 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=406457
)
and I could never figure it out until I removed my serial console line
at one point.  
I'll have to try this patch out and let you and the GDM 2.16.x
developers know what happens.
