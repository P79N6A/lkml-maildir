Hi Ingo,
  FWIW, I have placed all my latest upstream-able scheduler patches into
a branch in my git tree (against tip/master).
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ghaskins/linux-2.6-hacks.git
sched/latest
Gregory Haskins (11):
      sched: cleanup inc/dec_rt_tasks
      sched: track the next-highest priority on each runqueue
      sched: use highest_prio.curr for pull threshold
      sched: use highest_prio.next to optimize pull operations
      sched: only try to push a task on wakeup if it is migratable
      sched: pull only one task during NEWIDLE balancing to limit
critical section
      sched: make double-lock-balance fair
      sched: add sched_class->needs_post_schedule() member
      plist: fix PLIST_NODE_INIT to work with debug enabled
      sched: create "pushable_tasks" list to limit pushing to one attempt
      RT: fix push_rt_task() to handle dequeue_pushable properly

These are built/booted on my quad-core/x86_64 and look good to me.
1) the first four are the "next-highest" v3 patches that I submitted
yesterday
2) the last seven are patches that Steven has carried in 26-rt that have
not yet been pulled in to tip
I assume there is an implicit ACK from Steven on (2) since he pulled
them into -rt.  We still await comment from Peter re: (1).
Regards,
-Greg
