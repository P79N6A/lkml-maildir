This sounds like the most promising idea yet.
We could make kobject_add() bump up this second-type refcount (since
from now on it may be looked up). kobject_get()/kobject_put() wouldn't
need to grab an extra reference (we already have refcounting for this
object in place). kobject_cleanup() could do something like:
struct module * kobject_owner = kobj->owner;
...
call_release();
put_second_module_refcount(kobject_owner);
combined with the module unloading code waiting after calling the exit
function until the second type refcount dropped to 0. This would make
sure that the module is not deleted until the last release function has
been called.
The module would stay in memory (not be unloaded) until the last
kobject created by the module is deleted, but I think that is just what
we want. At least this doesn't mean that the module blocks its own
unloading.
