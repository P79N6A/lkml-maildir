It was easier to implement it in a that way.
Differencies will be only in function names - instead of msleep() it
will
be sleep_on.
Since it is atomic refcnt that is being checked wait_event can not be
used there directly.
I can change it's logic, it is quite simple.
Is it ok to postpone it until documentation changes are made in the
source code?

It is only rmmod/insmod who can call it 
[it is called from module unloading/error path].
Implemented just to check state when Ctrl+C is pressed.

I need to state that sending must be limited to BH context too.
I thought about it when creating locking schema and decided to 
not allow hard irq context, since receiving is already limited to
BH context.
I definitely need to put it into documentation.

Hmm...
snprintf() differs from scnprintf() only by returning value:
int snprintf(char * buf, size_t size, const char *fmt, ...)
{
	va_list args;
	int i;
	va_start(args, fmt);
	i=vsnprintf(buf,size,fmt,args);
	va_end(args);
	return i;
}
int scnprintf(char * buf, size_t size, const char *fmt, ...)
{
	va_list args;
	int i;
	va_start(args, fmt);
	i = vsnprintf(buf, size, fmt, args);
	va_end(args);
	return (i >= size) ? (size - 1) : i;

New object has 0 reference counter when created.
If some work is appointed to the object, then it's counter is atomically
incremented. It is decremented when the work is finished.
If object is supposed to be removed while some work
may be appointed to it, core ensures that no work _is_ appointed, 
and atomically disallows[for example removing workqueue, removing
callback, all with appropriate locks being hold] 
any other work appointment for the given object.
After it [when no work can be appointed to the object] if object
still has pending work [and thus has it's refcounter not zero], 
removing path waits untill appropriate refcnt hits zero. 
Since no _new_ work can be appointed at that level it is just
while (atomic_read(refcnt) != 0)
  msleep();
