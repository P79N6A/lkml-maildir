I meant really giving, rather than giving a copy, or giving the
original and keeping a copy.
You could make it require a pair of signatures, one from the vendor,
that the vendor keeps, one from the user, that the vendor never sees,
too.  Like some bank PINs, it gets generated, used to generate some
hash (the signature for the initial installation), printed in an
envelope for you and stored in the package along with the machine.  Or
something like that.
