I goofed in the report below. I had switched to the i82365
pcmcia driver to see if it was affected by the pirq problems
the night before, and forgotten to switch back to the yenta_socket.
Switching back to the yenta_socket, plus andrewm's keventd patch
allowed the collection of cardbus pcmcia cards to work. Apm suspend
and shutting down the machine do not cause an Oops either.
I do however still recieve a nasty message about a pirq table
conflict, but it does not seem to affect the operation of the 
card.
The pirq conflict message seems a little harsh though, and perhaps 
unnecessary.
Thank you all.
Cheer!
