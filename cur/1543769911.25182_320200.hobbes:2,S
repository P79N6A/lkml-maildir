OK.  I think we should go with the flag though since it could
also be used for memory allocation.
I've just added some code which allocates a scratch space for
unaligned input to the VIA Padlock (IPv4 ESP traffic is normally
unaligned due to the 20-byte IP header).  It could use this flag
to determine whether it should do GFP_KERNEL or GFP_ATOMIC.
Actually, has anyone considered using a 4-byte IP option padding?
It's legal per RFC-791 but it'd be interesting to know how well
it works in the field.
Cheers,
