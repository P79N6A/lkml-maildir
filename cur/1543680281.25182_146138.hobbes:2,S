If you seek to meet the dead under any load, there's no patch that uses
the timeslice driven scheduling that will work. You need a non-timeslice
driven scheduling like SCHED_RR (and talking about realtime, it is not
even sufficent with Linux). Since the POSIX SCHED_RR definition cannot be
allowed to be used w/out superuser rights for obvious starvation issues
that might cause of other tasks, we would really need either to push
a new POSIX defintion or to modify the SCHED_RR behaviour if called from a
non-superuser account. For example, a slot above all standard priorities
and below RT priorities should be reserved to host those pseudo-rt tasks,
whose dynamic priority will not decay but that they might expire if they
abuse of a predetermined CPU utilization policy. Basically their timeslice
will vary depending on the CPU utilization pattern and they might end up
in the expired array if they abuse it. For example, when one of those
internally mapped SCHED_SOFTRR tasks will expire we will recalc their
timelisce like we are doing now and we will also register for the
timestamp (jiffies) when the got recharged. If (jiffies - last_charge) is
lower then a pre-defined threshold we drop the task in expired array,
otherwise in the active one. This will make our SCHED_SOFTRR to be able to
always preempt SCHED_OTHER tasks and the above trick will also avoid
starvation.
