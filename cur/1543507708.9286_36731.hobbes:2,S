Are these the current network interfaces (IE: does eth0 = 192.168.50.254)

First of all the 'nameme' is the name of the tunnel - it does not have to
be and probably should not be tun0 (unless you like that name...)
Secondly the "remote" interface must be the closest ip wise to the machine
sending - IE: it is a routing style config where if I have two interfaces
on machine A, say A1 and A2, and the network connection is between A1 and
B1 then the "remote" part of the tunnel command is B1. Here is stupid
ascii art:
---------                         -------------
|       |                         |           |
|     A1---------------------------B1         |
|       |                         |           |
---------                         -------------
Your tunnel at A MUST have remote endpoint specified as B1 and conversely
the tunnel from B must have remote endpoint A1
That is the only problem you have. The internal or local address for the
tunnel can be either interface but is best specified as the internal.

Just try the different addressing - if you are not sure send me email with
your version of stupid ascii art 8-} and I will tell you what the ip
tunnel commands should be.
