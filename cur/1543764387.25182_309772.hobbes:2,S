There are many possible legal risks for a Linux distribution.
This thread is about one.
Another one is that RedHat removed MP3 support in their distribution 
from programs like xmms ages ago because of the legal risks due to 
patents. The Debian distribution still contains software that is capable 
of playing MP3's.
I'd say of the two above cases, the MP3 patents are far more likely to 
cause a lawsuit.
YMMV.
If your statement was true that Debian must take more care regarding 
legal risks than commercial distributions, can you explain why Debian 
exposes the legal risks of distributing software capable of decoding 
MP3's to all of it's mirrors?
