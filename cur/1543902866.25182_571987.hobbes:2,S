I've added several of the hugetlb guys to the CC list, plus CLameter;
but again not yet Trond since the details won't be of much interest
to him; though I have included fs/nfs/direct.c in the patch below,
since it's now looking like a bugfix rather than a cleanup.
I've kept in most of the background text for newcomers.

And I've changed my mind several times since then too: from thinking
that the DIO case gives hugetlbfs a lost dirty bug, to thinking that
it's okay after all, to thinking again that yes we do have a bug.

That's very unfair to Andrew, who took the trouble to write long and
enlightening comments above the functions.  Let's blame ourselves for
not looking there and reading them.
You won't much like the compound_head(page) I'm putting into
bio_check_pages_dirty, but I think it is being reasonable to
try to avoid scheduling work when that's hardly ever needed
(dirty already set and not cleaned in the meanwhile).
There are enough twists and turns in this area, that I also think
it's as well to keep something here to think about and comment on.

Oh, it doesn't take much to confuse me!

I believe I've reached my conclusion in the patch below, but definitely
need others to check and test.  I'll be out of contact for a few days
from tomorrow, so better someone else take this up.

I started from your patch.  But it now seems to me a bugfix to remove
those PageCompound tests, because they're preventing a hugetlb page
from being marked dirty, when Ken needs it to be marked dirty so
/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches doesn't drop the data read in by DIO.
(His original patch went into -stable: would the patch fixing
this all up need to go into -stable?)
For a while I thought it wasn't important, because get_user_pages
normally marks the pages dirty at the beginning, and there's no
pdflushing of hugetlb pages to clean them in the meanwhile.
But get_user_pages goes a different route on hugetlb pages, it goes
off to follow_hugetlb_page.  Which doesn't even take an argument to
tell it whether the page is being written to or not.  So far as I
can see, there's no preliminary set_page_dirty in that case (but
haven't checked in practice).  Therefore I now think Ken's case
would rely on bio.c or direct-io.c to set the page dirty after all.
(Side issue not addressed in this patch at all: the hugetlb folks
introduced private hugetlb mappings and hugetlb_cow in 2.6.16: yet
get_user_pages appears not to honour that, which seems a serious
omission: breaking COW is an important duty of get_user_pages.)
I think set_page_dirty just has to act on compound_head(page):
it's only in the head page that page->mapping is set, so set_page_dirty
can't even discover that it ought to go to hugetlbfs_set_page_dirty
without doing the compound_head(page) first.  Which then leaves
the distinct hugetlbfs_set_page_dirty rather pointless: we can
just use the standard __set_page_dirty_no_writeback.
Without that change, even after removing the PageCompound exclusions
from bio.c as you did, I suspect that DIO to a tail page of a
hugetlb page would never get to dirty the head page -
something the libhugetlb guys might like to test for.
I didn't see any attention to set_page_dirty in Christoph's
Large Blocksize (variable page_cachesize) patches, but I expect
he'd also be wanting set_page_dirty to act on compound_head.
