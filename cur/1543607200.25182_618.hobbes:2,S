I may end up doing it, but I don't share Alexey's enthusiasm about
removing the options from ip and moving to some fine-grained control over
proxy arp.
I certainly prefer simpler solutions.
Solutions based on static configuration, without dynamic resolution
protocols, are simpler.
That is what I have now: I add entries, which I want to expose and to be used
for answering arp requests, one by one by `ip proxy neigh add'.
Simpler solutions are less error-prone and more easy to debug.
