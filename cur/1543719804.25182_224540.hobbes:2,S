Yes it needs indeed. I have something here that treats stick as a
mouse on a passthrough port, much like Synaptics driver. It's not
ready for publishing yet though.

Exactly. If you check Peter Osterlund's X driver or my GPM patches
you will see that they get BTN_TOUCH or even ABS_PRESSURE events
and then decide for themselves what should be considered a tap and
what is not. And the logic is not dependent on a particular model
but rather on set of capabilities that device reports.
Kernel task is to convert data from individual devices into unified
representation and userpace task is to do with that data whatever
it wants. X driver does not (should not) care whether a mouse is a
serial or PS/2 or USB. It only wants to know that it reports 2
relative axis motions and has X number of buttons and X number of
wheels.
Now operation of a touchscreen is different from operation of touchpad
which is different from standard mouse and userspace has to distinguish
between these, but that's because they are different classes of input
devices and should be handled [slightly] differently.
