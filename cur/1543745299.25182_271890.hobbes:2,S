The problem occurs even when the PMTU is any value, 1476 would be one
example.
While I don't quite understand the xfrm4_tunnel_check_size bug by looking at
the code but
I have instrumented the function and don't see any behavior I disagree with
in the tested 
cases.  
It seems to me that this problem is more with Linux ignoring the received
ICMP error.  
ICMP messages from a host to itself, imh observation, aren't properly
handled and that is where the problem I have encountered is coming from.
