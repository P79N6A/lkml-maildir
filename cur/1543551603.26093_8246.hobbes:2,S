I dual boot 2.2 and 2.4 kernels using current modutils without any
problems, that is how I test my modutils changes.  You should even be
able to boot 2.0 kernels with modutils 2.3.18, as long as modutils was
configured with --enable-compat-2-0.  Systems using libc5.0 and need
--enable-use-syscall in modutils, but that is automatically detected by
modutils >= 2.3.15.

Details please.  I have no outstanding bug reports on lack of backwards
compatibility in modutils.
