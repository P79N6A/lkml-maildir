No, that's not the case.  Normally when files are written the data
isn't not flushed immediately, it sits in memory (the page-cache) for
some (usually) small amount of time.
If the data is critical applications should fsync (or similar) as
required.
FWIW my standard method of shutdown is:
     sync ; poweroff -f
sorta thing.  I don't loose any data doing this, (at least nothing
I've noticed).
   --cw
