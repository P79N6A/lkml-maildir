No problem. Generally, Marcelo is the right place for 2.4, but sometimes
it's better to filter things through the subsystem maintainer if at all
possible. For something trivial, I wouldn't have bothered asking to
redirect through me, but for something like this I want to make sure we
get on the same page, and that I test it out a little bit more (I hadn't
even tested this patch myself yet :)
Definitely thanks again for the help. This is the second bug recently
that I could not reproduce and it takes feedback and effort like you
gave me in order to track things down.
FYI, I checked, and this is a non-issue with our current 2.6 code (not
sure it's pushed to Linus yet) because we removed several points of
problems like this.
