    Quoting "PowerPC Operating Environment Architecture":
The Decrementer counts down. On POWER4, a Decrementer exception occurs when 
DEC0 changes from 0 to 1. On POWER4+, operation is as follows.
The exception effects of the Decrementer are said to be consistent with the 
contents of the Decrementer if one of the following statements is true.
* DEC0=0 and a Decrementer exception does not exist.
* DEC0=1 and a Decrementer exception exists.
If DEC0=0, a context synchronizing instruction or event ensures that the 
exception effects of the Decrementer are consistent with the contents of the 
Decrementer. Otherwise, when the contents of DEC0 change, the exception 
effects of the Decrementer become consistent with the new contents of the 
Decrementer reasonably soon after the change.
