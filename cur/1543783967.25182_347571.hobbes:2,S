Ugh.  Step one for my cleanup is to rename __ASSEMBLY__ to something  
defined
automatically by GCC (IE: __ASSEMBLER__).  And yes, I checked,  
__ASSEMBLER__
is defined by everything from old 2.95 to 4.0, even though it wasn't  
really
documented in anything older than 3.4.  This megapatch is basically a  
search
and replace of __ASSEMBLY__ with __ASSEMBLER__ over the whole kernel  
source,
except in Makefiles, where I just delete the -D__ASSEMBLY__  
argument.  If
this is generally acceptable, I'll break it up into small digestible  
pieces
and send to individual maintainers, unless someone wants to pass the  
whole
monster through their tree in one big lump.  This is a lot of code  
churn,
but it's a valid cleanup and will help me out as I try to make more  
of the
kernel headers easily digestible for userspace.
Ok, the patch itself is temporarily located here (Please be nice to my
desktop, it has a 650MB/day upload limit imposed by Virginia Tech  
that I'd
rather not go over) [patch is 308k]:

__ASSEMBLER__.patch
And here's the diffstat [27k]

__ASSEMBLER__.diffstat
Cheers,
