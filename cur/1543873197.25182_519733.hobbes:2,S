With your previous definition of work time, would it be that:
monotonic_time == work_time + stolen_time ??
i.e. would you be defining stolen_time to include the time lost to 
processes due to the cpu running at a lower frequency?  How does this 
play into the other potential users, besides sched_clock(), of stolen 
time?  We should make sure that the abstraction introduced here makes 
sense in those places too.
For example, the stuff that happens in update_process_times().  I think 
we'd want to account the stolen time to cpustat->steal.  Also we'd 
probably want account for stolen time with regards to 
task_running_tick().  (Though, in the latter case, maybe we first have 
to move the scheduler away from assuming HZ rate decrementing of 
p->time_slice to get this right. i.e. remove the tick based assumption 
from the scheduler, and then maybe stolen time falls in more naturally 
when accounting time slices).
I guess taking your cpufreq as an example of work_time progressing 
slower than monotonic_time (and assuming that the remaining time is what 
you would call stolen), then e.g. top would report 50% of your cpu 
stolen when you cpu is running at 1/2 max rate.  And p->time_slice would 
decrement at 1/2 the rate it normally did when running at 1/2 speed.  Is 
this the right thing to do?  If so, then I agree it makes sense to model 
hypervisor stolen time in terms of your "work time".  But, if not, then 
maybe the amount of work you can get done during a period of time that 
is not stolen and the stolen time itself are really two different 
notions, and shouldn't be confused.  I can see arguments both ways.
