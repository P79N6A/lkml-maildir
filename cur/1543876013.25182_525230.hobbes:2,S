Until someone fixes all the places in the kernel where scheduling can
be held off for tens of milliseconds, CONFIG_PREEMPT will be an
absolute requirement for many applications like audio and gaming.
Many of these were fixed a while back during early -rt development but
at some point the process stalled as the remaining cases were too hard
to fix...
