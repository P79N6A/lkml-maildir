Your paranoia is understood, but completely unfounded. As Pavel said, we
do not support such a feature. When/if we do, only the mechanism for
detecting a low battery state and transitioning to a suspend sequence 
would be in the kernel. The policy that stated what the watermark on the 
battery charge was to do that would live in userspace, and set on boot 
(long after the kernel was done booting). The default would obviously be 
OFF until it was set by userspace. 
Patches to implement this would be greatly appreciated.
