   Hello. This is a re-diff of the 2.4.17 patch I posted
   previously.

Hi Jason.  I noticed that your code assumes zones begin on well
aligned physical addresses.  This is not true.
For example, in page_color_start you use the raw
(page - zone->zone_mem_map) index as the color.  This
is wrong, what if the zone starts at page 1?  In such
a case all of your colors will be computed incorrectly
and pages with different colors in different zones can actually be of
the same color.
