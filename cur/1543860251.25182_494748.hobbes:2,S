How to add some warning prints?
And what's the problem with changing the generated files?
There doesn't seem to be much activity in this area, and the noise of 
changing the generated files doesn't seem to be a problem for me (except 
if anyone else is semnding patches for the same area at the same time.
It's not as if this noise was big compared to the diff between two Linux 
releases...
Regarding external trees:
Do you know about anyone actually using it?
The fact that we have zero usages in the kernel and that it doesn't have 
any additional functionality seems to be a strong hint noone knows about 
it. And if anyone really uses it, the fix is so trivial...
