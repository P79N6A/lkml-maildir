well, for private yes, but even as a small company I would invest in a
rother more solid hardware RAID system than into software. I saw so many
horrible data losses due software raid or IDE HDs (which where in a
external hardware box actually), that I don't trust this much anymore.

well I always had a hot spare HD in my boxes because I was a bit
ultra-paranoid, actually I became ultra-paranoid :)

there is for Software, but when it comes to Hardware security, I trust
in real RAID (unless it is private adventures)
