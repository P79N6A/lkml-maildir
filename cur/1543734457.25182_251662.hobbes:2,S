the problem is, generally it is not valid to have a thread on the thread
list that has no ->sighand structure. This is what happens when we exit
a task:
        write_lock_irq(&tasklist_lock);
	...
        __exit_sighand(p);
        __unhash_process(p);
the BUG() is useful for all the code that uses next_thread() - you can
only do a safe next_thread() iteration if you've locked ->sighand.
there's one exception: in the procfs code we can get a reference to
almost-dead tasks as well that are not even in the tasklist. (This is a
relatively new thing introduced by me that can happen due to the
preemptability of some of the exit path.)
so i believe your fix papers over the real bug which is the use of an
almost-dead task for thread iterations. Since we've already done
__unhash_process() not doing the BUG introduces a more subtle bug: the
use of the stale PID pointers! So i believe the right fix is the one
below, which (under the safety of read_lock(tasklock)) checks for the
availability of task->sighand - and skips the thread iterations if so.
