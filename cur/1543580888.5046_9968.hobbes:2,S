What kind of crap is this?
It is not the kernel's job to work around RedHat bugs.
If RedHat ships a broken compiler, it is their responsibility to tell
their customers and provide a working one.
This kind of compatibility crap has caused commercial Unices to
suffocate in their own bloat.  We don't need this.  And we don't want
this.
