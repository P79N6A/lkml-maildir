hi,
I recently installed RH 6.0 (Hedwig) in my machine.
I tried to make a new kernel image with sound capabilities.
When i ran "make config" it is fine. Then, when i tried to run "make dep"
i first got timestamp errors on scripts/mkdep.c file. I touched it.
Then i got the following error
----- Starts here --------
gcc: Internal compiler error: program as got fatal signal 11
make: *** [scripts/mkdep] Error 1
----- Ends here --------
What could be the reason?
regards,
-Ramasamy.
