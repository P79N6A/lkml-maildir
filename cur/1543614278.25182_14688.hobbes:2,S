I served on JSR-51, the expert group that helped design the new I/O
model.  (The design was Sun's, but we had quite a bit of input.)
For network I/O, there's a Selector object which is essentially
a nice OO wrapper around the /dev/poll or kqueue/kevent abstraction.
Selector does have a distinctly Unixy feel to it, but it can probably
be implemented well on top of any reasonable OS; I'm quite sure
it can be expressed fairly well in terms of Windows NT's asych I/O
or Linux's rt signal stuff.  
(I suspect the initial Linux implementations will just use poll(),
but that's something the Blackdown team can fix.  And heck, it
ought to be easy to implement it on top of all the nifty poll
replacements and choose between them at jvm startup time without
any noticable overhead.)

p.s. Davide, I didn't forget /dev/epoll, I just haven't had time to
post Poller_devepoll yet!
