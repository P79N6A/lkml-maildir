Yeah, way too many. 
That said, at least _some_ of them are:
 - casts to volatile inside arch-specific code serquences (ie the _good_ 
   kind of volatile - associated with _code_ rather than data). 
   See for example include/asm-i386/io.h for 100% valid examples of this
   kind of usage.
 - function argument values for functions that need to be able to take an 
   arbitrary pointer ("const volatile void *" is the most permissive 
   argument type - anything else the compiler can complain about you 
   dropping qualifiers)
   See include/asm-i386/bitops.h for examples of this kind of volatile.
So I'd expect that maybe one percent of them are actually valid ;)
And I suspect that a huge majority of the truly crapola ones are in 
drivers. Oh, well..
