We could also add links in the form of:
	/sys/class/<subsystem>/<nested_class> ->
			/sys/class/<subsystem>_<nested_class>
to keep compatibility with nested classes too to give userspace
a chance to catch up...

No, not at all. The input0 will get a new interface, blahdevX, exactly
like eventX, mouseX, jsX, tsX, etc. and it will go into "interfaces".
input0 itself will stay in /sys/class/input/devices.

Yes, I agree that we should have device tree in /sys/devices. But I do not
think that flat classification is sufficient. Right now it is not enough
and we compensate for it with names.
