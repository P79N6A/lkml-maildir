Errata matter a lot unfortunately - older IDE controllers commonly have
bugs where changing the set up of one interface affects the other even
if a transfer is occuring.

If the documents/errata for the chips are checked then I can see it
making sense. I do worry that it may introduce other races because the
IDE locking is such a mess but that would be true of any change and
eventually has to be addressed.
I think it makes sense, with corrections.
