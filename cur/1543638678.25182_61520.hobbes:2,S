    Hi all :)
    The output of 'cat /proc/meminfo' is ugly by today standards,
since is very frequent having more than 99 Mb of RAM and the current
meminfo just supports 8 digits before outputting ugly tabulations.
    So, how about raising that 8 digits to at least 10, thus allowing
pretty tabulations up to 9 Gb of RAM?
    If it will be accepted I can make the patch against the current
-ac kernel, for example. I know that is only a cosmethic change, but
I use meminfo a lot and I would like to see a good tabulation ;))
