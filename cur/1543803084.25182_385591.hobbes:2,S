What actually happened is that normal command timed out
and because of that driver reset the device which caused
it to loose DMA:
->ide_atapi_error()
    ->ide_do_reset()
      ->pre_reset()
        ->check_dma_crc()
          ->__ide_dma_off()
Somebody needs to investigate why __ide_dma_off() is called
et all and if we need to restore DMA after reset (don't count ATM
on me, I'm buried by bugreports).  Ondrej, could you fill the bug at
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 so we don't lose it?

This is a separate issue and is related to retrying failed DMA
commands.  Driver doesn't know what was the cause of the timeout
and it shouldn't disable DMA for the device (only the failed request
should be retried in PIO mode).
Any takers? :)
PS1 please don't trim cc: list
PS2 please use linux-ide@vger.kernel.org for ATA problem
Thanks,
