Yes, you have the idea most precisely.  You left out:
  - post the patch to the respective mailing list (the one the patch
    was sent to)
> Will Linus immediately killfile mail sent from this bot?
I don't think so, unless the bot is really poorly designed.  This is *not* 
going to be a spambot.  When the time comes, i.e., when the bot is designed 
in detail, or better, function, we'll ask him, ok?  Or, if he so much as 
scowls in this direction, work stops right now ;-)
> Will hpa host it at kernel.org?
Again, once we know what the details of the bot are we'll ask him, i.e., how 
heavy a resource user it's expected to be, if he even thinks the idea is 
sound, etc.  Right now he could only answer in general terms, so the thing to 
do is produce something concrete, not theoretical.

Somewhat unexpectedly, three coders responded to my call for volunteers:
   Kalle Kivimaa <killer@iki.fi>
   Rasmus Andersen <rasmus@jaquet.dk>
   Giacomo Catenazzi <cate@debian.org>
I must say, I've been impressed with the insight of all three.  Would you be 
a fourth?  A mailing list has been set up (by Giacomo):
   
http://killeri.net/cgi-bin/alias/ezmlm-cgi
> Is it going to make a difference?
Yes, I think it is.  At the very least it will give Linux users a place to go 
and troll for interesting patches, sort of like Freshmeat.  I'm expecting a 
considerably more from it though.  Look no further than your own list above 
to see what it can do.  Which, by the way, bears a remarkable resemblance to 
the list we just hashed out a few minutes ago.
