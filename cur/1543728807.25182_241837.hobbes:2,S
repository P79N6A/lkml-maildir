Hi Jesse,
Andrew's latest tree should have a number of improvements and changes
to the sched domains code which you will need to synch up to.
One issue you may have is that Ingo removed the ability to have arch
code override the domain structure due to it being too hazardous for
architectures to use in this form (which I don't entirely disagree with).
Now I guess your patch could go into the generic code because it is
pretty general - however are you guys going to want to do anything
more fancy with these things?
Nick
