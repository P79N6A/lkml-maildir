the thing isn't changing much anymore, there are only a few lines
fixes across the last updates.
the mprotect merging won't be as small, but it should not be more than
an hundred lines rewrite and it's orthogonal with the rest of the
changes. I plan to complete it before the end of the week.
Keep in mind this whole thing is going in production in a matter of a
week, so please test and review now. I'm uncertain if to add the
mprotect merging to the production tree after I completed it, I don't
see it as a requirement, infact I believe mprotect has always been more
important for file mappings than anonymous memory (I know this is
certainly the case for some big app where merging file mappings in
mprotect actually would help a bit too). At this point in time unless I
get a complaint for a real app I'll probably avoid any further change to
avoid invalidating the current testing. So I may keep the mprotect
merging in a separate patch.
I'm _very_ confortable that whatever might go wrong with this new code
that I cannot imagine right now, it'll always be a lot better than the
stuff that we know goes wrong with rmap or/and 4:4.

I'd like to see the -mm writeback changes merged ASAP since they're the
most invasive from my point of view ;)
thanks.
