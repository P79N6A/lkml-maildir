Heh, sounds like you'll get to go there lose all your money come back and

Too fast a woody that stays up too long?
Perhaps 2 seconds up and 10 down would be better than 1 up 60 down. I was just 
trying to make a point with those numbers; they were hardly tuned. Also 
perhaps the child penalty of 50 is now too low and IIRC the 95 used a long 
time ago may give the shell a better chance of firing up.
