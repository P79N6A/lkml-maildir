This bothers me. I prefer building a monolithic kernel with only a few 
drivers compiled as modules (e.g. those drivers which are under active 
development and are upgraded often). I believe firmly that certain drivers 
should be part of the monolithic kernel.... either way, i'm not about to 
debate it. i'd just like to know exactly why this is being done, and to 
lodge an objection against it.
