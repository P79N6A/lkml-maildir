IF a real replacement shows up, that has significant benefits for a
substantial number of users, and which doesn't bloat the kernel, I'll use
it gladly.
But the discussion up to now has shown that many very important properties
of the current get lost, and the (rather minor advantage IMHO, if it really
is an advantage)), /dev/cXtYdZsW naming can clearly be gotten by much
simpler ways. So I'm still waiting.
