Please provide me with more info.
I gooled a bit after some NVIDIA src - but I stopped when I had
to accept some NVIDIA stuff.
The purpose is to provide good support for external modules.
If it breaks things I need to find out why - and see where to fix it.
I would not be suprised if NVIDIA (and wmware for that matter) takes some
assumptions which it should not. But I need to find out why it break,
and for that I need more information!
So please provide me with the following information:
1) Exact log when it goes wrong
2) Pointer to or copy of the relevant files
