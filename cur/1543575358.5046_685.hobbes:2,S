So do something silly like
cp linux/arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S linux/arch/i386/vmlinux.lds
and you will see that the patch against the files are identical.
/linux/arch/i386/Makefile
arch/i386/vmlinux.lds: arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S FORCE
        $(CPP) -C -P -I$(HPATH) -imacros $(HPATH)/asm-i386/page_offset.h -Ui386
arch/i386/vmlinux.lds.S >arch/i386/vmlinux.lds
All it is is a leftover file........
