I'm not sure it was clear that '=>' was meant as logical implication.
Read it as "therefore".
It's actually funny that what your inference sequence (in spite of the
missing initial operand) rings so true about my impressions about some
of the reactions I'm getting here.
  GPLv3 forbids tivoization, therefore developer has requirement for
  tivoization in the license, therefore GPLv3 forbidding tivoization
  is bad.

Sorry that I missed the <irony> markers.

FWIW, I haven't taken such a sample, because I know my network of
contacts would likely make it statistically useless.  I'd not try to
make an argument based on that.

I've honestly tried not to.  I believe Linus has, too.  Many of us
have talked past each other, a lot.
That was actually the point behind breaking up the argument in small
pieces.
If Linus hadn't got the whole argument, a number of times, before,
this might be described as dishonest, but since he did, and he can
refer back to those messages, he can know where I'm going.

Of course he doesn't.  But he will.  Because he's always right, and he
wants to show that.  That this is a bait and he knows it won't stop
him.  He knows there's no hook, because he knows where I'm going with
the argument.  But it's going to be interesting to watch.

Wait a minute, these figures you made up are for the tivoized hardware
(no changes allowed to the GPLed software in it), or for the
non-tivoized hardware (changes allowed to the GPLed software in it)?
> those who will contribute them back: 38 (25%)
Regardless of what you meant, this is 38 developers *on top* of
however many the company pays to work on that, unless you're jumping
the gun and spoiling the multi-part argument.
> What you are arguing is that people should abandon
I'm not arguing any such thing.  Where's any such argument above?
At this point, I'm only comparing a tivoized device with a
non-tivoized device.  Nothing but it.
