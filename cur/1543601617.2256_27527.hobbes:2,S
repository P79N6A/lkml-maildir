But I can't distribute the file fs with my application,
because I can't expect my
user base to patch and recompile their kernel just so they can run
my application.
Perhaps what is needed is an 'inuse' filesystem or a way to make 
filesystem modules without patching the kernel. 
My concern is that ordinary tools like mount check the proc filesystem
to see if a partition is already mounted and it seems likely that tools
like mke2fs do this too. Sysadmins might feel that existing tools
protect
them from damaging something in use. I'm looking for a way to follow
this
general behavior with raw partitions.
