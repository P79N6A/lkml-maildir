I fundamentally question the need for this. Once a binary grants
privileges, it is no longer an ordinary file. It is a system file. Who
cares if jbloggs was the originator? We have the same setup now with
suid-root binaries. The "originator" (whoever compiled it) is
different than the "owner" (root) if the binary grants
privileges. This is not causing a problem.

Now why would root (or the capabilities granting utility) remove
execute permission in the first place?

Gee, David, I sure do appreciate you assuming that I didn't think
about the issues before mailing.
No, I've read the various posts on this topic and thought about the
issues. I just don't agree with your view. Deal with it.

Big deal.

Strange idea to grant capabilities to a binary which is only run by
root.

What's this 't' bit needed for? Oh, I get it. You want to grant
capabilities! Wow. How useful, since root already has those
capabilities. Oh well. Just a few more cycles doing nothing useful.
Instead, why not run portmap under a special account? Then it makes
sense granting privileges.
Alternately, if you *really* want to run this as root, just fill in
the section of the ELF header which removes all but the required
capabilities. *Note that this does not require privileged filesystem
bits, since you can always reduce capabilities*.

Nice emotive words again.

Funny scenario. What I don't see is why named is being run by a
privileged user in the first place. Why not have a named account? Or a
daemon account?

I prefer:
named:	inode: euid=0, suid
	caps:  ports
and then run named under the daemon account.

Why on earth would you want to do that anyway? Marking a binary
suid-root means "give executor all privileges".

Doesn't help me when there are files with the sticky bit in /usr. Oh,
yeah, I forgot to mention, we have junior administrators who can write
to certain parts of /usr but who don't have root access. I don't want
them hacking in either.

No, you've just made assumptions about the suid-root scheme which
create these non-problems.

Interesting point. Erm, so why did you raise it? I haven't seen anyone
denigrate you because you don't have patches in the kernel. Who said
this? I must have missed it. Tell me who it is and I'll abuse them
privately.

So far all the "problems" I've seen you raise are non-problems. They
seem to stem from a set of assumptions which I for one don't share. I
can guess at some of those assumptions, but it would help if you
enumerated them. It may be more productive for me to directly
challenge those assumptions rather than challenge their results.
And let me say it again: we *can't* use the sticky bit, because it's
insecure. And disabling over NFS is no good, because I *want* NFS
support for capability-granting binaries. All the world is not
Linux-2.2.
