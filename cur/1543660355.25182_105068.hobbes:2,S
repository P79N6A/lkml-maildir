The structure is clear (devices & cards) but we need something like device
groups which contain subsets of devices per card. Actuall driver model
doesn't allow this directly, so we are looking for a way to implement
this.
Imagine:
card -+-> audio1
      |
      +-> audio2
      |
      +-> IDE
If we have two card drivers (one for audio1 & audio2 and second for IDE)  
then current code will fail, because only one PnP driver can be attached
to a card.
