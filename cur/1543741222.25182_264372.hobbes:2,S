Jeff didn't like it because the original version also worked without
/proc being mounted.  Well, tree times, then it crashed.  I don't have
that in-deep knowledge of vfs stuff, but I somehow feel that the attempt
to access /proc without mounting it is the reason for the crash.  I
don't feel like bypassing the vfs layer so I didn't attempt to make it
wotk like the original version.

http://www.suse.de/~kraxel/uml/patches/2.6.9/
 has my current patchset
with some (short) comments what the patches do.  The mconsole fix is
there as well, and will be there until either someone comes up with some
better fix (or it gets merged ;)
