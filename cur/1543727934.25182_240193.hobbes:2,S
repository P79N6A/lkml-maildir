No, it's all just building up to the kernel internally always using a 
pread/pwrite-like thing to the drivers, and then maintaining f_pos 
entirely in the VFS layer. All the VFS interfaces do this already (since 
that is how the user-visible pread/pwrite works).
But a few drivers are buggy (they access f_pos directly even if it was a
user-level pread/pwrite), and in particular the /proc sysctl interface was
totally broken this way.
So I've fixed the sysctl code - that _did_ require a prototype change, but 
wasn't horribly painful, and am going through drivers..
