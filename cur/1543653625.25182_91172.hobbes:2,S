Currently we pass all kinds of parameters, the e820 memory map being
one of the significant ones.  Though the arch specific locations are
not generally the best ones to use.

When you can do it passing tables, at a fixed or a relatively fixed
address is a powerful way to do things..  At least when they are
supposed to have a long lifetime.  I'm not quite certain about
a temporary solution.

Yes.  Getting the information down to user space and then putting
it in the kernel is a reasonable thing to do.

For command line arguments that is trivial 
--command-line="`cat /proc/cmdline` extra arguments".  
For the rest it would require a little more work, as all of the
kernels current parameters are not currently preserved.  But my basic
take is that I would rather derive/create the parameters to the new
kernel than just copy them from some fixed location.  Then passing
the current values just becomes a matter of policy, which the user can
control. 
For me it is important to be able to boot new kernels, and things
other than linux.  And especially in those cases the policy needs to
be driven from user space, as there is no real standardization of
parameters or what can be passed.  Nor is there much desire among
the various kernel authors, and bootloader authors to come up with a
standard format they all can use.  A good proposal with an unchanging
story and years of history behind it may eventually change some
minds, but I'm not holding my breath.
So beyond what functionality is currently there, I am not real
enthusiastic about optimizing the case of do what I just did.  For me
that is not an especially interesting case.
