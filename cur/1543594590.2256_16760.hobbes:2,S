That one has already been fixed in -pre3 and I think also
in -ac14+ kernels (haven't verified the -ac kernels, though).
The "bug" exists because of a change in refill_inactive(),
which is now a lot closer to being balanced. It's not a bug,
but with the way the statistics are generated it sure look
funny ;)

Rik
