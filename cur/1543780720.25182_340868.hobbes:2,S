NVIDIA won't be documenting nForce4 SATA controllers, so Linux NCQ
support for nForce4 is unlikely.  I'm hoping this will change with
future products.

The SATA-IO SATA-II specification says nothing about host controller
implementations.  Intel documents a host controller implemetnation in
the AHCI specification which is becoming an industry standard, but
nForce4 SATA is not AHCI.
