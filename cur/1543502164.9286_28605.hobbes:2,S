Couldn't agree more ... that is why I sent a patch for this (ie to
fix swapoff) on linux-mm, and reiterated the pointer to the patch 
in this thread. Here it is again:

Let me know if you want me to create it against pre5. Or if you 
see a problem with it ... we talked about it quite a bit on
linux-mm.

I assume you are talking about the fault path here ... none of the 
patches I posted adds page_table_lock to that path, right? Of
course without the lock, there might be other problems, I am 
not sure yet, will let you know if I see something ...
