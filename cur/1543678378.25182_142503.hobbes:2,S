Also, I am not sure how the IO-APIC & IRQ routing work, however, with the
ATA/100 TX1 (first generation promise controller, the interrupts are
shared differently.
Whether this makes a difference or has anything to do with the spurious
interrupts/messages, I am not sure.
Before:

Now to see if I get any more of these spurious interrupts...
