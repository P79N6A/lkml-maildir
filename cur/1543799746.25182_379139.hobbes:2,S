Not a bug, but for very subtile reasons:
There are no writes to the wait_queue structure except the 
list_del_init(), and for list_del_init() no memory barriers are required 
because finish_wait() uses list_empty_careful(), i.e. the spin_lock() is 
only bypassed if both write operations from list_del_init() have completed.

fixed in -rc7.
