Regardless, it isn't the VFS maintainer's job to maintain the FS
code.  What I would suggest is that someone go through the linux-kernel
archives for the last few years, search for every time there was a change
to the VFS, and make sure that the patches code is compliant.  THEN, if
Alexander still see's some problems, maybe he'll be so kind as to point
them out.
