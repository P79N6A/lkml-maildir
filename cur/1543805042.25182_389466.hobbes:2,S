Given that my current patch requires memory regions to be mapped at the
same address, randomized mmaps won't really make it any worse.  It's
unlikely mmap done independently in separate processes will land on the
same address.  Most of the large OLTP applications use fixed address
mapping for their large shared regions.
This also should mean large text regions will be shared, which should be a
win for big programs.
I've been kicking around some ideas on how to allow sharing of mappings at
different addresses as long as the alignment is the same, but don't have
the details worked out.  I figure it's more important to get the basic part
working first :)
