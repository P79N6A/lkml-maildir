This situation is still a concern.  From where did this additional register
information come?
Was it reverse-engineered?  If so, by whom and how can we satisfy ourselves
of this?
Was it from published documents?
Was it improperly obtained from NDA'ed documentation?
Presumably the answer to the third question will be "no", but if
challenged, how can we defend this assertion?
So hm.  We're setting precedent here and we need Linus around to resolve
this.  Perhaps we can ask "Shem" to reveal his true identity to Linus (and
maybe me) privately and then we proceed on that basis.  The rule could be
"each of the Signed-off-by:ers should know the identity of the others".
