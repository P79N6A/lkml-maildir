Yepp, gmake is kindof stupid in that respect - it does also not try
to use flex if there is no lex, etc...  I'd really vote for a BSDish
sys.mk.

What about simply removing the firmware source and assembler from the
kernel tree?  We have lots of firmware in the kernel tree for which
there isn't even firmware  avaible...
The few people that want to do firware development could download it
from your ftp site.

Of course it doesn't work. We've performed a software upgrade.
