Hi!
I have the following problem:
kernel 2.4.12, md and raid1 compiled into the kernel.
/dev/hdb old linux installation
/dev/md0 -> /dev/hde1,/dev/hdg1 new installation
When I boot my old installation the md device is automatically configured
by the kernel and I can mount it (reiserfs) without any problems.
When I try to boot the new installation with the same kernel the md device
is initialized, but the kernel cannot mount the root device. I get msgs
about FAT problems and about mounting root as msdos.
Here some config files:
lilo.conf:
image = /boot/lx-2.4.12
	root = /dev/hdb1
	label = old
image = /boot/lx-2.4.12
	root = /dev/md0
	label = new
	optional
Thanks a lot for any information
Best wishes
Norbert
