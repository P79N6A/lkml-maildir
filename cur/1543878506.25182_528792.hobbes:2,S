Why should we change our response to the same error? The only solution 
to this loop is when people stops answering you and you "lose".

Please, don't address someone you meet for the first time as "you people"!
Yes, we do _work_ together, it is a community and as a community you 
have to follow the social rules agreed upon. Without all those 
pro-Reiser peoples who knew how to work with the rest, there would not 
be a ResierFS/Reiser3 in the kernel. Unfortunately, Hans is in this case 
his own worst enemy and has ruffed quite a few feathers over the time. I 
don't think you would like someone who tells you "if you do it my way, 
then you are doing it wrong"...
But personally, even if I find Hans a bit too strong-headed, he got some 
interesting design-ideas and the Reiser-filesystem is something I think 
many find interesting as a concept but not yet trust-worthy for their 
own machines.

Am not sure how much help I would be but from the responses to your 
benchmark-list, there seems to be many who could help you. But first I 
think you should set up a system to test on, and then after some tests 
and made the result public, there will (most likely) be people who ask 
you to test it in some specific way.

And no-one has asked the file-system to _read_ the disk, but to be 
designed to help restore the file-structure. This I have found to be the 
main-point people complains about.
It is like arguing against air-bags in a car. Of course the car should 
not be responsible for preventing accidents, but they are designed so 
_if_ it happens, you should not be totally screwed.

Sorry to hear that, but two wrongs does not make it right.
