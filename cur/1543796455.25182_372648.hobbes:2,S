It is usually considered a bad netiquette to cross-post in public and
subscription-only lists. I wonder if pointing to subscription-only
service to get the feeling about planned driver core changes is a good

recall anything interesting in the last couple of weeks. Is there a
driver core mailing list I need to subscribe?
