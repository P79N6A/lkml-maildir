I believe it was Linus that made the name change.

So you are already coding a special case in for 2.4.11 to give them the
warning.  Might as well take that special case and extend it to selecting
for file from the server.
I have a feeling the majority of the people browsing the kernel.org will
not be using your software.  It is probally best that the warning stays in
place for everyone, just so that kernel is avoided.
