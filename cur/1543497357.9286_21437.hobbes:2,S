Happy to hear that :).
>separate patches which I can look at?  This is one simple optimisation
ASAP. Some second ago I started playing with the proggy that lockups the
machine recursing on the stack (that I am been able to reproduce here too
under some condition). When I'll understand which is the problem that
causes the lockup, then theorically I could just start the merging stage.
If you are interested I can CC the separate patches also to you.

Linus asked me to wait Ingo's page cache code to be included in 2.3.x
before starting sending him patches. I am a bit worried starting
exctracting separate patches _now_, because if Ingo's page cache code will
break my patches, then I'll have to generate new patches tomorrow... So I
would like to have hints from Ingo. (note: I am fine also waiting a bit
more of time, just know that from my part I would just did the merging)
