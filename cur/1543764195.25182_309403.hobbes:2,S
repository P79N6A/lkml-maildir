Subject: [PATCH] fix minor "defaults" issue in mm/Kconfig
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/6/126

The following patch applies on top of 2.6.12-rc2-mm1.  It fixes a minor
user interaction issue, and removes an early reference to SPARSEMEM.
Without this patch. the "choice" menu would always default to FLATMEM,
as it was listed first.  Move it to the end so that the other defaults
have a chance first.
