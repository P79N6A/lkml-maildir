As I wrote in some other mail, I doubt it is our old SCSI code that limits
the commands/second throughtput. Some latency from device (including the
FC card) may well be the cause.

Hmmm. We can imagine any kind of control when the host acts as a target.
Layers + full control = slow, in my opinion.
Perhaps something like the CAM3 "host target mode" should be enough.

What do you want to abort ?  Once a command has been passed to the lower
layer, it must complete with or without error, or time out.
The abort of a command can get hard to perform cleanly, depending on the
actual state of the command you want to abort.

What is a SCSI functionnality for you ? If you want all possible, you must
deal directly with the hardware. If you want common fuctionnalities, you
must interface device drivers that deal with common device models. If you
want to have a handle on the commands sent to a device, you must use
"passthru" services and deal with the device model (and features) by
yourself.

I suggest you to invest CAM3 specifications first. The FreeBSD CAM is a
derivative and is very different from official CAM1/3 on some points. It
has also some design/implementation errors in my opinion. 
For example, the SIM queuing (CAM3 10.4.2-10.4.3) implementation in
FreeBSD can only have race conditions on error recovery (queue freeze), in
my opinion. 
But obviously FreeBSD CAM seems to be a far better SCSI stack that the
current Linux SCSI code and looking into it is certainly very interesting.

You mean CAM3. In my opinion, 1 year full time minimum + bunches of SIMs
(low level drivers) to adapt or rewrite.

Not a good idea, in my opinion. My suggestion is to allow both the CAM
stack and the old SCSI stack to be configured in the kernel, allowing
low-level drivers (SIMs) to be converted when time will allow.

I have had any kind of curiousity about SCSI.

I don't have such a plan due to lack of time.
