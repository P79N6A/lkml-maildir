It's too early in the morning for reading RFCs. Does RFC2822 say you should
add your own domain to unqualified addresses in non-local mail, or just 
say that unqualified addresses aren't legal?
If the latter, rejecting the offending mail would seem more appropriate 
than adding '@vger.kernel.org' to it.
Might also be useful to stop any mail with null reverse-path from getting 
to the list - or do we already do that and the ones that slipped through 
couldn't even get that right?
