I imagine it'll break spectacularly as the tty layer handling changed
between the two quite a bit. Do you know if the modem is receving the
characters as you typed and the echo is delayed or vice versa.
I do have one patch for the rocket driver to fix an obscure Oops case
but nothing else. I'm also hoping to help find a way that works for
comtrol and the kernel folks to get a current comtrol driver into the
tree in a way that they can maintain easily.
Please stick the bug into the kernel bugzilla and assign it to me. I'll
do a bit of digging see what is up
