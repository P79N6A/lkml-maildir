Rubbish! This is what evolution is all about! Species do not instantly
become extinct when a better one (occupying their niche in the
ecology) comes along. They become extinct when they are driven into
the ground by superior competition or a changing environment. They
hang on until the bitter end. Sometimes the "obsolete" species makes
an evolutionary jump changes the world forever. In any case, evolution
does not stop putting effort into a species just because something
better has come along.
One of the great strengths of the Open Source movement is that it is
driven by evolutionary development. To say that development of some
project should be terminated because you think some other project is
better misses the point. Besides which it's arrogant. Volunteers are
free to work on what they like: you have no right to tell them what
they should be working on.
Why not forward your troll to the *BSD mailing lists after doing:
s/Linux/BSD/g
s/NGOS/Linux/g
and see what a warm welcome you receive.

Read what I said again. The point I was making is fairly obvious: the
Linux kernel shows no sign of a slowdown in development. Your claim is
that Linux is, or will very shortly be, obsolete. To be painfully
explicit, I refute your claim by drawing attention to the continued
development of Linux. Until people run out of ideas, it will not be
obsolete.
Of course if 90% of Linux users switch to something else, then you
also could consider it obsolete. But I doubt that will happen while
new ideas keep coming.
I wouldn't be at all surprised if the Linux response to NGOS's is to
make an evolutionary leap (assuming an NGOS performs as well as
Linux).
