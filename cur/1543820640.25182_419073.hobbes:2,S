This has a slight taste of a bzip2 error.  As I'm instantly running 
2.6.16.9, and have .11 ready for a reboot, I've not encountered any 
such with my compiles here, but after having been burnt a couple of 
times, I now get the .gz files to src the stuff and have not had that 
sort of thing happen since.  YMMV of course, but its one suggestion of 
something to try.

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
