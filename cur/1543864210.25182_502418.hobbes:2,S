Subject: [PATCH] libata: add a dummy set_mode() in pata_pcmcia
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

CompactFlash cards in a passive PCMCIA adapter don't seem
to like the ATA_CMD_SET_FEATURES command, which causes
libata device probing to fail.
Since PCMCIA only allows PIO mode 0 anyway, there is no
point in ever setting a higher speed. Adding the dummy
function seems to do the right thing.

This bug was reported earlier in 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7711
 by 
wkl@informatik.uni-kiel.de.
I have not been able to find out _why_ all my CF cards reject
the SETFEATURES_XFER command, but I have verified that the
same happens when trying to use hdparm with ide_cs.
Note that none of my cards are CF-4.0 compliant, so they
also don't do UDMA modes. The highest mode claimed to be
supported by one of my cards is PIO-4, but I can't set
it into any of the modes it likes.
