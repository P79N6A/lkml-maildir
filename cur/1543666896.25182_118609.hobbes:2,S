Hello all:
  I'm interesting in software suspend. I'm tested the 2.5.64-mm6 kernel.
It really stable. And suspend/resume function also can limit works. When
I use net driver it still can not works. It will Oops. The problem is
xxxx_resume is recalled, To fix it possbile have two ways.
1: add a value in driver private, test it before suspend/resume.
   It will change ~100 files.
2: add a value in driver common.
Can someone tell me which way good is?  Or have other good method.
Thank you.
