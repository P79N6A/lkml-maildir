I'm looking at.  If only because there is a reasonable chance doing this
will fix the races with a threaded init.
However I just found something nasty.  The wait __WNOTHREAD flag.
And my quick search seems to find at least one user space applications
that uses it, and it is widely documented so I suspect there are
others :(
I played with moving the lists into signal_struct, and short of
architecture specific users of task->children all I had to touch
were:
 include/linux/init_task.h |    2 +-
 include/linux/sched.h     |    5 +-
 kernel/exit.c             |  159 +++++++++++++++++++++------------------------
 kernel/fork.c             |    2 +-
 mm/oom_kill.c             |    4 +-
So it should be relatively easy to change this child lists around...
