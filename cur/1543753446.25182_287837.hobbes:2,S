Hello linux-experts,
     while executing pipe syscall, same inode is used
for both reading and writing. Now, if all processes
accessing the inode have terminated, the inode will be
removed. Now I am recording inode information in my
own structure in a kernel module by intercepting
syscalls. If the inode is no longer in use and if it
is removed, at that time I want to remove my record
also. How can I do that?
     Can we intercept ordinary functions defined in
kernel header files in the same way used for syscalls?
How can we do that? for eg, I want to intercept
pipe_wait function defined in pipe.c. Is it possible?
Thanks,
selva
