Hi,
I narrowed down Samba weirdness I observe on 2.4.10 to preempt patch.
Plain 2.4.10 works fine, 2.4.10+preempt (with latency measurement turned on)
is sometimes oopses, and sometimes reports 'file already exists' when I 
attempt to copy a file from WinNT box to Linux. Sometimes it works ok
(50% or so...)
I am very willing to help in curing this coz low latency is great.
Feel free to contact me for any additional info.
