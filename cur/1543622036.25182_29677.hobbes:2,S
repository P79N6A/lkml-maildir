Hmm.. Are there any other kind?
Another way of saying this: how can a conditional schedule _ever_ be 
nothing but a waste of cycles and code size with preemption enabled?
If the reason is the BKL, then I would much prefer those paths to be 
BKL-fixed, than have two different conditional schedules.
In short, I'd rather get a patch that just unconditionally makes the 
conditional schedules no-ops with preemption enabled. That would seem to 
make a lot more sense.
