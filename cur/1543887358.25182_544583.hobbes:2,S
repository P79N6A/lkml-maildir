Perhaps the paper was inspired by preexisting code. Perhaps the code
dated back to the 70's.
The weight consistency testcase is largely done on account of Davide
Libenzi's already having written such a load generator apart from
incorporating the already-written code to postprocess the results.
I have no particular need to rely on the cfs patches for whatever
scheduler patches I'd care to write. I suppose I could write some if
I feel particularly inspired. Code review is not my forte anyway.
