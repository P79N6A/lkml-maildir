Can the transfer go to pages mapped into the AGP gart, using their gart
side mapping ?

You have to grab them at boot time via bootmem to get them in a range of
your choice. Otherwise you can use
	get_free_page		-	grab a page
	virt_to_page		-	page struct of page
	virt_to_bus		-	bus addr of page
virt_to_bus isnt portable because real world pci bus mapping on non x86 is
deeply murky and mysterious. But you probably want to worry about that
after it works.
