Yes, it's a race. Actually a variant of the race that lead to the introduction of set_current_state():
test_bit is a simple read instruction. i386 cpus are free to execute it early, i.e. they can execute it before the write part of "++local_irq_count(cpu)".
I think smp_rmb() is the right barrier - could you write a patch and send it to Marcelo?
