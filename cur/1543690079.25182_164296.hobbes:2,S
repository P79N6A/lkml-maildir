Yes.  Firstly, you can't do "wake one" if the one you wake might be
some completely unrelated process which happens to use the same
address.  Secondly, I implemented fair futexes by relying on the
return value of FUTEX_WAKE to indicate how many people were woken: you
set the futex to a magic value, call FUTEX_WAKE(1), and if it returns
1, you've "passed" the futex directly, otherwise you unlock the futex
like normal.  This is surprisingly useful for implementing
"drop_futex_if_someone_is_waiting()" in cleanup threads etc.
Sorry,
Rusty.
