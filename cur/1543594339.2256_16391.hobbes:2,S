Hi list
        Sorry to bother you with such a trivial query.
To make a routing decision ip_route_input() is called. It fills the skb->dst
with appropriate entry. Can anyone point to the exact location where I can find
the next hop and output interface IP address.
It seems
skb->dst->dev->ip_ptr->in_dev->ifa_list->ifa_address is o/p i/f ip address and
skb->dst->neighbour->dev->ip_ptr->in_dev->ifa_list->ifa_address  is next hop IP
										address
Please correct me if I am wrong.
Thanks for all the help.
Manoj
