I guess I don't understand -- why is it wrong for code that runs only
in early early bootup, when there is only one process context, to use
common code to e.g. register a hotplug cpu notifier?  Should the
powerpc numa code be made to wait to register its notifier until
initcall time or something?

Yes, which would be why this code never triggered a warning when
cpucontrol was a semaphore.
