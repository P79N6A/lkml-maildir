Hi,
I've gone and tried the ultimate acid test of crappy x86 hardware on the 
vanilla prerelease kernel, and installed it on my iopener. The kernel 
loads, uncompresses, initializes hardware, and then immediately reboots.
It all happens so fast that I do not really get a chance to see the last thing
printed before it fails.
The last kernel that I had running on this was a test12 pre something.
Any ideas?
