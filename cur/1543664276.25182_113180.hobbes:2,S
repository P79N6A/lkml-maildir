But the module driver interface has an impact on the other driver 
interfaces and that's what I tried to describe in the previous mail.

rmmod could already fail before, because the module is busy, so I'm not 
sure, what should break here.

Now you're skipping ahead. You are already looking at the possible 
consequences for the module user interface, before we actually made clear 
in which ways the module driver interface could be changed.
There are of course dependencies between the interfaces, but you can 
change a lot in one before you have to modify another.

There is/was no count for the first?!
Which "new" count?
