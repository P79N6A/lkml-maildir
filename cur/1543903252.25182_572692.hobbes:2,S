you give up on the suspend becouse you have no way of getting the user 
task to give up the lock.
however, kernel locks should not be held by user tasks, user tasks are not 
expected to behave in rational ways, allowing them to compete with kernel 
tasks for locks is a sure way to get a deadlock or indefinate stall.
what locks are accessed this way?

please define terms so that we are all on the same page
what do you mean by
system-wide suspend
runtime suspend
