My testing shows that the timer interrupt runs for about 21 usec. 
That's 2.1% of its time just running the timer ISR!  No wonder this
causes PM issues, 2.1% cpu load is not exactly an idle machine.  This is
a 600Mhz C3, so on a slower embedded system this might be 5%.
So, any solution that would allow high res timers with Hz = 100 would be
welcome.
