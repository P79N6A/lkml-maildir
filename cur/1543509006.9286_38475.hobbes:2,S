Andrea, this was _SPECIFICALLY_ removed because it made the buffer
cache locking more complex.  You risk total and complete deadlock
unless you change all of the buffer cache spinlocks to be IRQ
spinlocks.
That is too high of a cost to pay just for a debugging hack, which is
all that show_buffers() is.
There is no way Linus will accept this patch.
