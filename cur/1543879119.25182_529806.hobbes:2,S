Ken uses the other (superior!) way of implementing ringbuffers: the head
and tail pointers (the naming of which AIO appears to have reversed) are
not constrained to the ringsize - they are simply allowed to wrap through
0xfffffff.  Consequently:
ring full:		(head-tail == size)
ring empty:		head==tail
numer-of-items-in-ring:	head-tail
add to ring:		ring[head++]=item
remove from ring: 	item=ring[tail++]
(adjust the above for AIO naming assbackwardness)
(requires that size be a power of 2)
Many net drivers do it this way for their DMA rings.
