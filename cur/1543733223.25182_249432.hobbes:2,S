I won't refute that. It is an unfortunate effect of using dumb scanning to
free higher order memory. Orthogonal to my patch, which just uses the 
current
freeing mechanism to ensure kswapd gets off its bottom and does some 
work for
higher order allocators.

I think my mechanism is about as on-demand as you can get. I think we've
typically leaned this way WRT the memory manager as opposed to background
scanning and freeing.... so sure you could introduce a new method for 
freeing
higher order memory (ie. defragmenting), but I think you'd still want to use
my kswapd scheme in that case as well.
So instead of always freeing pages, you'd say:
    if (!watermark_ok(order 0 pages))
       try_to_free_pages
    if (!watermark_ok(order-that-i-need))
       try_to_defragment_pages
