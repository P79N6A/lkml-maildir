Heard of my treescan program?  Didn't think so.  It's a highly optimised
`find'.  I'd like disk trace stats to help optimise treescan's access
patterns.
I'd like, in decreasing order of usefulness: a summary count of accesses
(reads & writes); the list of blocks looked up by the fs in order
(whether they're in cache or not); timestamps; the list of block read &
write requests submitted for i/o in order.
