Hi all
I have some questions concerning the linux kernel development.
1) When will the linux-2.2.2 international kernel be available?
2) When will linux get support for raw devices? DBMS's such as Sybase
and Oracle tend to prefer these instead of files and block devices.
3) Wouldn't it be more efficient (especially for low-memory systems) to
modify lines 315-317 in mm/page_alloc.c from
        freepages.min = i;
        freepages.low = i*2;
        freepages.high = i*3;
to something like
        freepages.min = i*2;
        freepages.low = i*4;
        freepages.high = i*9;
???
This way, paging will start earlier and (I guess) the system will run
more smooth.
4) Finally: Does someone know about a good way to strip a 2.[12] kernel
so it can run on 2 megs of RAM with support for ESDI and MCA? I have
this PS/2 80 (80386DX16, 80387, 2 meg RAM, 70+115MB disk) and would like
to install linux on it - just for kicks.
