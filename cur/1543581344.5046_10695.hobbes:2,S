Hi, I've been experiencing numerous problems with the 3c509 driver in 2.4.1.
When I force it to go to both cards (ether=10,0x300,eth0
ether=11,0x210,eth1), they both act strange (and also claim to be BNC when
they are both TP).  The link light at the hub flashes three times
repeatedly.
Donald Becker thinks it is a problem specific to the conversion to 2.4
