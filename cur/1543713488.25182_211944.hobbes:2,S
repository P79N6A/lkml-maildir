Me too,
(model number 2681-BDG) and since the release of 2.6.0 many things have been 
sligthly getting worse or never worked at all.
-It used to suspend/resume correctly until 2.6.3, but afterwards reboots 
during resume.
-Unplugging a usb bluetooth dongle oopses the machine since 2.6.4 (used to 
work ok before).
-The radeon fb drivers both have little problems (garbled screen, last screen 
line not updated correctly)...
-The pcmcia controller does not work correctly (it stays dead if a pccard is 
plugged in after bootup, I need to restart the pcmcia services to make it 
work again).
-I never succeded in making infrared work, however it works fine under 2.4.
I'm very willing to help all the kernel hackers out there to solve these 
problems, please contact me, I can run whatever test/patch/hack you might 
throw at me.
Regards, Biker.
