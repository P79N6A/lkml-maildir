Joerg, this patch fixed the bug for me :-)

clear PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY for truncated page in block_write_full_page()
The `truncated' page in block_write_full_page() may stick for a long time.
E.g. ext2_rmdir() will set i_size to 0. The dir may still be referenced by
someone, and have dirty pages in it.
So clear PAGECACHE_TAG_DIRTY to prevent pdflush from retrying and iowaiting on
it.
