Been there, done that. Yup, seems to have a mounting problem on my system too.

It doesn't.

Are you on the kernel mailing list. Look around there and see if there are any
submitted messages. If you want to submit a request to get this fixed, you
will have some homework to do; get the oops report (if applicable), run the
kernel in a debugger and try to get some relivant information via gdb ( or the
like), and generally do some work before posted 'it's not working' messages.
Cheers,
