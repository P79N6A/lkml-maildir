So after all my (s)wag was correct :)
So I took a quick look through ATAPI specification (I have to say I'm a 
user not a developer) and found nothing that would seem to flush that 
damn cache. So the problem is that some CD-R drives (probably the older 
ones) expect you to eject CD after burning (even a buffer/cache clearing 
after burn would seem logical to me) and there is nothing you can do 
about it (except buying different drive). Unfortunately it is not a 
kernel or cdrecord issue (if it was it could have been fixed:) ). I 
guess you'll just have to do with ejecting :). Sorry.
