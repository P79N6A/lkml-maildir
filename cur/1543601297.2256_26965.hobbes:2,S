Hmm.  Perhaps or perhaps it is using the information poorly.
There is an alternative approach to have better aging information.
An address_space can be allocated per mm_struct.    And all of the
anonymous pages can be allocated to that address_space.  The
address_space can then have an array or better a tree of extents that
list which indexes correspond to which swap pages.  With some
pages not being backed.
Getting the allocation of indices correct so that merging will work
is a little trickier then now, as is the case of a private writeable
mapping of a file.  But in a lot of other ways the logic becomes
simpler.

Do you have any arguments for the reverse mappings or just for some of
the other side effects that go along with them?
