If _Bool does end up in the user-kernel ABI, be advised that validating
them will be tricky ("b == true || b == false" or "!!b" won't work), and
the compiler could in theory generate code which tests truthfulness by
comparing to 1 in one place and non-zero in another.
My brief IRC conversation with gcc people regarding validating untrusted
_Bool resulted in the instruction to never store a value in a _Bool
until after it has been validated.
