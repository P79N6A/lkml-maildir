Red Hat distributions after 7.0 provide `lspci`. You still have
to parse ASCII. FYI, it's not hard to write a 'C' program
that directly accessed the PCI bus from its ports at 0xCF8 (index)
and 0xCFC (data). You need to do 32-bit port accesses and you
can set iopl(3) from user-space.
If you want to 'roll-your-own', I can send you some code to
use as a template.
