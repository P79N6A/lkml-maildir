Sure, that's to be expected. If we never ran out we would be wasting
memory. My point is that you should rerun the same test with more
request slots -- and I'd be surprised if you gained any significant
performance on that account. I never said that you'd never run out,
that's of course not true. In fact, running out is what starts the I/O
typically on a 1GB machine and bigger.
