I'd move that ATAPI cd-rw to the primary controller, and reserve
the Promise controller for UDMA(33) and above disks. Promise chips
seem to require explicit driver support for handling ATAPI devices,
and I'm not confident that Linux' driver has that. Quoting from the
box my Promise Ultra100 card came in:
"Supports ATAPI: Yes(*)
 (*) Non-Windows environments require manufacturer device drivers."
which I think says it all.
