But it isn't that mbs in preemptible code are buggy. If they are
scheduled off then back on the same CPU, the barrier will still
be executed in the expected instruction sequence for that process.
I think the minimum needed is for cpu *migrations* to be memory
barriers. Again, this isn't any particular problem of mb()
instructions - if cpu migrations weren't memory barriers, then
preemptible code isn't even guaranteed ordering with its own memory
operations, which would be quite interesting :)
