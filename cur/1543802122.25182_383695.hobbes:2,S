It is even more funny: i discovered that it depends on the type of 
ethernet switch to determine which driver i have to use.
- extreme Summit48 _or_ crossover cable to some onboard via rhine:
  xircom_tulip_cb
- el-cheapo mini-switch, probably realtek inside:
  xircom_cb
and yes, i tried all different autonegotiation settings etc (with
xircom_tulip_cb at least since xircom_cb seems to lack ethtool support).
It also seems to additionally depend on which machine i put these cards
into and of course on the chip revision and the phase of the moon.
If i ever figure out a pattern, i'll file a bug.
For now i changed to a machine with a decent built-in card instead of
rtl8169 crap (which forced me to pull out the xircom cards again).
And "not working" was of course not "not working at all" but "works
somehow but with inferior performance" for both drivers.
