if we take a step back; Mark afaics only wants to put 1 in there...
And that makes sense; either you want the "no latency" C1, or you want the lot
(esp given that C2 and deeper are at the whim of the bios, what they mean varies
over time. Actually even C1 does that on some AMD systems);
Longer term I'd suggest we make an option that basically is "C1 only",
(or technically, "use hlt only")
that solves Marks VMWARE thing, and is a lot closer to what people really want.
Well, that and if VMWARE really can't deal with latency in their kernel module
they should use the proper code for that. It's also a ton easier to implement, since
it basically is "don't use the CPUIDLE idle loop, but use the traditional hlt one"
