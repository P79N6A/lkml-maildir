Forget [Patch 24/23].  This patch is bad.
The C preprocessor does not bind symbols the way this patch requires. 
With this patch, including both cpumask.h and nodemask.h in the same
header would end up with a broken mixture of implementations if cpumasks
were bigger than one word, but nodemasks not.
[Patch 24a/23] will be out shortly, replacing this patch.
