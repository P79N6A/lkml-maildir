Thats surprising, nobody has intentionally overclocked it.
Now we did some experimenting with it and no BIOS settings seem
to affect the FREQ numbers. (Lower CPU/mem speed, 50/25 AGP/PCI speed.)
The FREQ still stays fixed at 85.
Motherboard is EP-4PDA2+.
Any idea how to remove the overclocking?  Otherwise it seems
like driver bug to me.
