What faulted, kernel, userspace, where did it break, what did gdb say.

insmod sound dmabuf=1    (I think I'll make this the default behaviour)
Recording overrun means the program didnt queue buffers to the sound driver
fast enough. That can also be down to shortages of DMA memory or using
ISA sound cards on machines doing heavy PCI I/O.
