it's not attached but never mind :) and yes it's the correct procedure.
btw, is it an hyperthreading cpu? Had you any problem with aa2?

I just merged all Ingo's updates, except the new features like
SCHED_BATCH and SCHED_IDLE, I don't feel they're needed in 2.4 and now
the o1 is finally stable after the last fixes that apparently improved
tbench of another 10% and that should avoid the sluggish behaviour under
high load in smp and now that sched_yield doesn't hang anymore by
refiling to the expired queue. I only skept those two features (they're
not even in 2.5 yet).
