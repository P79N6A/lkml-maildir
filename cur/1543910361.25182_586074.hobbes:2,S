What I did was for patch submission.
That script should probably be named "get_patch_cc_list".
It does now by default use git to find and include the
most frequent signatories.
I think that descriptions of subsystems are not
particularly useful.  The file hierarchy should
effectively do that.  I think a tool to inform a
"list of interested parties" when a file is touched
is useful though.
If there is to be a subsystem definition, I think it
needs to be hierarchical with things like specific
net drivers not a subsystem, but an element of the
subsystem net:drivers (or drivers:net or both).
If these elements are bundled together into a single
"subsystem" descriptor file you will run into the "hot"
file problem that Linus described.
cheers,  Joe
