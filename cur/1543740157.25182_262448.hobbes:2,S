Hello,
I just tried upgrading from 2.6.7 to 2.6.9 and got a kernel oops during
boot. Stack trace looked very similar to the one João Luis Meloni Assirati
reported on Oct 05 2004 (Subject: hpt366 under hpt372N oops). I have a
HPT372N on my board with one disk attached.
Is there any news on this issue yet? It keeps me from using 2.6.9. :-/
thanks,
ron
PS: Keep me in Cc:, please. I'm not on the list. Thx.
