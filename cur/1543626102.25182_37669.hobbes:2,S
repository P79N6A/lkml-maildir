Yes.  (I didn't look at the patch itself) but, it should allow you to change
the *nice* value of the process.  It doesn't allow you to change the actual
priority of the process/thread.  The scheduler itself takes into account the
nice value and interactiveness (ingo's new scheduler at least...).
One thing to thing about though, is that maybe the administrator set the
user to nice value 5 and this would allow the user to get back down the the
default of 0.
One thing you could do in that case would be to set the *other* processes to
a higher priority...
