Hello,
I tried 2.6.21 and still had the same problem, I was going to back
farther but then I decided to try a few things with my 2.6.23 config.
$ diff config-2.6.23 newconfig-2.6.23-gentoo

config-2.6.23 is the vanilla kernel's config that was experiencing the
hangs.  2.6.23-gentoo was also experiencing the hangs.  Then, I
disabled CPU frequency scaling (and a few other things I guess,
looking at the diff..) and recompiled and..  no hangs yet.  Uptime 3
and a half days.
If you wish I can use a vanilla kernel.
