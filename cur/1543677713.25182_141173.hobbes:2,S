Did you run 'make oldconfig' on the old configuration? I see
"bool '   G100/G200/G400/G450/G550 support' CONFIG_FB_MATROX_G450"
in drivers/video/Config.in, so 'm' is illegal value for this choice, 
and anything can happen, including explosion of your computer, or 
creating driver which supports no hardware...
                                            Best regards,
