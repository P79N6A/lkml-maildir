OK, here is my updated patch for fixing the SYMPTOM of this problem and
not the root CAUSE of the problem.  The symptom is that ext2/ext3 will
happily free and allocate blocks that are supposed to be filesystem
metadata if there is an error in the block bitmaps.  Errors could
previously crop up in the block bitmaps if, say, an inode had corrupt
block numbers, or an indirect block had garbage in it.
The patch changes the code so that it still complains about trying to
allocate or free such a block, but then it "does the right thing" by
keeping the block allocated for (what it thinks is) filesystem metadata.
If, in some future revision of ext2, we change the location of some
metadata, at worst we will have a few blocks which cannot be allocated
by an older kernel, but e2fsck will clean up at a later time.  That is
far preferrable to corrupting the superblock or bitmaps or inode table,
which will, in turn, lead to more filesystem corruption.
The patch has been in my kernel tree for a long time, but is relatively
untested as it only handles error situations.  It seems pretty obvious,
however, so it should go into the kernel proper.  Patch is against 2.4.18,
but does not intersect with Andrew's recent fixes to filesystem-full
handling in ext3_new_block() in 2.4.19-pre7.  It also includes the checks
for block free overflows that have been in 2.5-dj for a good while.
Cheers, Andreas
