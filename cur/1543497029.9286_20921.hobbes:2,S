Nothing. It does not do any syscalls, until I kill it, it then does:
--- SIGTERM (Terminated) ---
syslog(0x7, 0, 0)                       = 0
close(0)                                = 0
time([927929975])                       = 927929975
write(1, "<6>May 29 00:19:35 kernel: Kerne"..., 58) = 58
time([927929975])                       = 927929975
write(1, "<6>May 29 00:19:35 kernel: Kerne"..., 58) = 58
nanosleep({1, 0}, {1, 0})               = 0
close(1)                                = 0
unlink("/var/run/klogd.pid")            = 0
munmap(0x4000c000, 4096)                = 0
_exit(1)                                = ?
