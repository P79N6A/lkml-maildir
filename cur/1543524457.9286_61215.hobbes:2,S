Hi!
I have a problem with two 3c509: I reed the docu from
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/misc/multicard.html
It SEEMS to be a problem to configure two 3c509 because they are
"connected" to the corresponding ethX in order of their MAC's. It would
be MUCH nicer to adress the NICs with her (corresponding) IO and IRQ. Is
there a (simply?) possiblity to solve this problem?
THX!
Bye,
Meini.
