We hold i_alloc_sem right until dio_complete, don't we ? Is it still
a problem ? 
But, I'm wondering if this solution just covers up the real reason
for the single thread problem ? We shouldn't even be issuing IOs
beyond i_size into the user-space buffer !
BTW, part of what I'd have liked in a rewrite would be to unify more of the
AIO and sync io paths, consider doing all this in task context (like in
the retry code) etc. Would reduce the number of cases to watch out for. 
But that's a different matter, not for now. I agree that the buffered 
vs DIO stuff in combo with AIO is what makes this really complex, so
it is a hard problem.
