I also saw some of the things that you reported with Debian proper (sarge).
Unfortunately, I haven't been able to use my HFS+ formatted system with
Linux for a while, I may do so, if necessary to fix the bugs.

I, OTOH, can test fixes on the next weekend, since I have a full backup
scheduled for this week.

I had not noticed what are the size of the blocks that HFS+ seems to use,
but indeed I saw both very confused du and ls outputs. I don't know what
may be the cause.

That's the only way that I am using a HFS+ fs (fia Firewire or USB), since
the drive in question is in an enclosure.

I haven't seen this behaviour for lack of testing, but I will try to
reproduce it with an HFS+ fs on a file mounted via loopback.

I agree. This is, indeed, very scary.
Just another data point, Rogério.
