Here there's no oscillation that I can see.  It climbs steadily to prio 16 
and stays there forever, with the hog running down at the bottom.  I did a 
quick requirement that a non-interactive task must run every HZ ticks at 
least, with a sliding "select non-interactive" window staying open for 
HZ/10 ticks, and retrieving an expired task if necessary instead of 
expiring interactive tasks (or forcing the array switch) thinking it'd be 
enough.
Wrong answer.  For most things, it would be good enough I think, but with 
the hog being part of irman2, I have to not only pull from the expired 
array if no non-interactive task is available, I have to always pull once 
the deadline is hit.  I'm also going to have to put another check for queue 
runtime to beat the darn thing.  I ran irman2 with a bonnie -s 300 and a 
kernel compile...  After a half an hour, the compile was making steady (but 
too slow because the irman2 periodic cpu hog was getting too much of what 
gcc was intended to get;) progress, but the poor bonnie was starving at 
prio 17.  A sleep_avg vs cpu%*100 sanity check will help that, but not cure.
All this to avoid the pain (agony actually) of an array switch.

(someone should wrap me upside the head with a clue-x-4. this darn thing 
shouldn't be worth more than 10 lines of ugliness.  i'm obviously past 
that... and headed toward the twilight-zone at warp 9.  wheee;)
