What's the best way to capture a register snapshot within the kernel
context?  For example, how do I capture pt_regs in any function,
assuming I'm not taking an exception ... I'm executing normally.
(My question is specific to x86 code).  I realize show_registers()
is available for dumping the register state, but to get the current
register state, it looks like you have to pull each register from
the context of get_current().  Is that what we're left with?
And while we're on the topic, what about register snapshots for each
CPU?
Thanks for any advice.  I'm looking for a consistent method to do
this (so we can create proper kernel backtraces for our post-crash
analysis utilities.)
