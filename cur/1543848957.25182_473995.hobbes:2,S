Ok I'm not the OP but I can confirm the problem.
From /proc/mounts:
arthur:/mnt/disk2/mp3 /mnt/mp3 nfs ro,nosuid,nodev,noexec,vers=3,rsize=8192,wsize=8192,hard,proto=tcp,timeo=600,retrans=2,sec=sys,addr=arthur 0 0
Reports ro here while mount still reports rw:
arthur:/mnt/disk2/mp3 on /mnt/mp3 type nfs (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,addr=192.168.88.80)
