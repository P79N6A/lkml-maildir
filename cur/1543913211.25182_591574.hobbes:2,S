First of all, I'm not surprised these patches solve the deadlock here.
And that's a good thing, and it means it is likely that we want to merge
it (actually, I quite like the idea in general, regardless of whether it
solves the deadlock or not).
However I really have an aversion to the near enough is good enough way of
thinking. Especially when it comes to fundamental deadlocks in the VM. I
don't know whether Peter's patch is completely clean yet, but fixing the
fundamentally broken code has my full support.
I hate it that there are theoretical bugs still left even if they would
be hit less frequently than hardware failure. And that people are really
happy to put even more of these things in :(
Anyway, as you know I like your patch and if that gives Peter a little
more breathing space then it's a good thing. But I really hope he doesn't
give up on it, and it should be merged one day.
