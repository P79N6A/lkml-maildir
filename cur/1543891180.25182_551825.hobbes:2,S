Subject: [patch] timer stats: speedups
From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
make timer-stats have almost zero overhead when enabled in the config 
but not used. (this way distros can enable it more easily)
also update the documentation about overhead of timer_stats - it was 
written for the first version which had a global lock and a linear list 
walk based lookup ;-)

 timer_stats is a debugging facility to make the timer (ab)usage in a Linux

 timer_stats should be used by kernel and userspace developers to verify that
 their code does not make unduly use of timers. This helps to avoid unnecessary
