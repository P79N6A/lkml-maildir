I am doing a DMA from a card to system memory. The system memory "physical
address" is '0x104000'. I am doing this on x86 with kernel version 2.4.2.
Can this address be the address of a user space buffer?
Regards,
Daljeet.

you are right, the highmem-compatible solution is to use page-mem_map as
the physical page index.
