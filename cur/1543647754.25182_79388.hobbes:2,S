No, I do not.  MD is in _no_ ways a volume managment framwork but just
a few drivers that share common code.  That's somethig entirely different.

I don not think cosumes minors is a valid design criteria for designing
an inkernel framework.

Please explain why they shouldn't be accessed.  And following your
argumentation tell me why you haven't submitted a patch to Linus
yet to disallow direct access to block devices that are in use
by a filesystem.

Please explain the added complexity in detail.  In fact it does remove
complexity by having a standard set of object to work on, removing the
need for code, data and data structure duplication.  Before answering
this mail I'd suggest you take a look at ldev_mgr.c in the evms
tree in detail (and yes, that file is horribly broken implementation-wise,
but this discussion is about the complexity it adds)

This argument is NIL if the infrastructure is part of exactly that
evolving block layer.  You might have noticed that kernel code
compatility to other releases is not really a criteria for the
linux kernel development, btw..
