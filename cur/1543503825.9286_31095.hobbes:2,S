as David pointed out, this is exactly what we're interested in :)

the reason i mentioned flanging is that it is the effect you get from
small delays, be they intentional or otherwise. sure, things get worse
if you do more CPU intensive stuff, but if you can't get a 0.2ms
flange to work OK, you can't hope to get much else to work.
