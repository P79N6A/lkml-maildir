Thanks for your suggestion.  I have looked rtc-ds1307 too before I
tried to modify m41t00 driver.
It seems some works are still needed to support M41Txx chips by the
driver.
1. The driver contains ds_1340 (or st m41t00) definition, but it seems
   no way to select the ds_type.
2. As m41t00_chip_info_tbl[] in m41t00 driver shows, M41T81 and M41T85
   have different register layout.
3. It lacks some features (ST bit, HT bit, SQW freq.) in m41t00
   driver, though I personally does not need these features.
I choose changing m41t00 driver by (1) and (2).
If we really need a super generic driver, I suppose adding ds13xx
support to new m41txx driver is less hard.  I think having separate
drivers are good enough for now.
