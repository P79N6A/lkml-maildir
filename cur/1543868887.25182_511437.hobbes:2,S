I think we need to drop this now. The report that says that this *fixes* 
something might have been on regular interrupts only. I currently suspect that 
it breaks all MSI interrupts, which would make sense if I look a the code. Very 
bad indeed.
I'll try to come up with something else or send a patch that reverts it.
