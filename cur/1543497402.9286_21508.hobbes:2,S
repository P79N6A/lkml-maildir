I have to disagree strongly...
A stream of n bits from /dev/random should not be repeatable with any
frequency greater than 1 in 2^n, but it definately should be uniformly
distributed. Otherwise the numbers aren't really random, and therefore
they aren't useful for any purpose I can think of -- certainly not monte
carlo integration or anything else that uses "random" numbers, and not for
cryptographic applications.
