Thanks a lot for the pointer. I was able to find the original bug
report. After reading the various fix proposals and the current code I
think I understand what is going on.
Basically, the problem is that one should not run a user land program
too early because not everything is initialized yet (for instance
pipefs). This might happen because at initialization some drivers can
trigger automatically /sbin/hotplug (via call_usermodehelper()). So the
fix which was applied consists in populating the rootfs only once all
the kernel subsystem is initialized. In this way, the hotplugging is
still triggered but as the user space program doesn't exist it can't be
called! (hehe)

Yes, now that I understand the problem, reading the initramfs twice
would in no way help!

Yes, that looks like a nice way. Actually, I discovered that for suspend
and resume, there is exactly the same need, and a special flag is
already available: usermodehelper_disabled.
So here is a proposal patch leveraging this flag. The rootfs is
populated early but user land execution is forbidden until we reach a
sufficient initialization state.  I think it even has the bonus of
doing _explicitly_ what we want (avoid user land execution).
Does this look good? (if so, I can probably make it even cleaner by
renaming/removing the rootfs_initcall level)
