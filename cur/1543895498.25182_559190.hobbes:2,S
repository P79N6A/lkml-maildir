Sorry, no we cannot. You seem to not accept that "in my opinion".
That's not somethign we can disagree on. My opinion is _mine_ to state. 
There's no room for disagreement. It's my opinion, and your "agreement" is 
not optional.
So when I say "I think what Tivo did is good", then you'd better just say, 
"ok, that's your opinion, and I respect you for it".
Otherwise you're a douche-bag and an idiot.
And once you realize that _I_ think that Tivo did is good, you have to 
accept that I think that the GPLv3 is the worse license in my opinion.
So stop blathering about anything else.
Just accept it. Just repeat after me: "Linus thinks that the GPLv3 is a 
bad license, and Linus is not confused".
Don't call me "confused". Don't bother talking about what _you_ think, or 
what the FSF thinks is the "spirit". Don't say that you cannot understand 
it. 
Because if you cannot understand it, the only thing it shows is _your_ 
lack of understanding.
