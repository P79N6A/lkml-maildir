there is another option available: let the modules use files.
then the module compiled as eth0 could get one set of data (ip-adress, ...),
eth1 could load another file, but the random-"module" uses only one data file
(storing entropy).
I know that that doesn't sound pretty - BUT:
It could be combined with some of the other options (preferable 4).
eg: "eth0"-data requested, flag PERSISTENT set: file is created and mmap()ed,
pointer returned to module - looks like normal memory.
another module requests run-time data - is not stored on disk, but kmalloc() used.
that is a generic interface which allowes a common interface for both types of 
storage - and the path for the data could be given to the kernel like the path to 
insmod today.
how about this?
