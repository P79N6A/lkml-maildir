Yes I have PREEMPT_REALTIME enabled.
The thing that comes to mind is I do have a script that does
  echo 0 > '/proc/irq/10/Esoniq AudioPCI/threaded
as part of ensuring the all the preemption stuff was set right. I may
have run that script prior to getting those messages. I thought you
said before that the non threaded IRQ stuff was disabled. Perhaps this
interface needs to be disabled as well [unless you really decide to
fix this limitation...].
I was already going into that script to add something like...
  for N in 1 3 4 6 8 10 11 12 14 15 ; do
    chrt -p -f 99 `pidof "IRQ $N"`
  done
to make all the threaded IRQ's max priority RT fifo tasks. I can
certainly comment out the IRQ thread disable code while I'm at it.
