OK, the current code is obviously junk:
	if ((event->sigev_notify & ~SIGEV_NONE & MIPS_SIGEV) &&
			event->sigev_signo &&
			((unsigned) (event->sigev_signo > SIGRTMAX)))
		return NULL;
a) it's doing
	if (foo && foo > N)
   which is redundant.
b) it's casting the result of (foo > N) to unsigned which is nonsensical.
Your patch doesn't address b).
I don't thik there's a case in which sigev_signo can be negative anyway. 
But if there is, the cast should be done like the below, yes?
