Yes please, the IBM way described above makes my brain hurt! That seems to
be the singly most non-intutive way of defining the prefix "giga".
Perhaps we should output a small explanation at the start of the boot
procedure: "Linus defines GB as 1073741824 bytes". And no, I'm not
serious (there is a part of me that would love to see it defined in terms 
of pi or something though). ;)
