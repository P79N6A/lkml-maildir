I don't know how you use "unqueue" in this context.  If a queued futex
is one which is /locked/ by te call, then yes, this is the semantics
needed.  Atomically locking a number of futexes means that if one of
the set cannot be locked all operations done to lock the others have
to be undone.  It's an all-or-nothing situation.
Locking is not as easy as you might think, though.  For non-PI futexes
there is deliberately no protocol in place describing what "locked"
means.  The locking operation has to be customizable.  This is what
the FUTEX_OP_* stuff is about.
And you wrote that currently each futex needs its own file descriptor.
 So this would have to be changed, too.
