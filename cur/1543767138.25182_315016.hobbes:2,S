init/main.c:
char saved_command_line[COMMAND_LINE_SIZE];
inclide/asm-x86-64/setup.h:
#define COMMAND_LINE_SIZE	256
Rubens command line is a total of 251 chars, adding "console=tty0" will
exceed it.

I thought that saved_command_line on x64 was like the other archs, an
untouched copy and it wouldn't have made sense to apply another string
to it then, but I was wrong as it is the working line.
I still don't understand why console=tty0 is to be appended however.
