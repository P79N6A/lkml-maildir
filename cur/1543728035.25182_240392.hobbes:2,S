I'm not about to burn CDs trying, but I do believe
that "a ruined cd is likely" would be accurate if I
were to keep busy with Mozilla and such. OpenOffice
would surely ruin a cd. Light web browsing makes my
mp3 player skip.
Not all of us have hardware like you do. Encoding
video is something I wouldn't bother to try, even
without the CD burner going!

Of course it breaks the real time policy entirely.
It would have to be enabled via a sysctl.
The NMI watchdog breaks cli/sti. We have it anyway.
This is the same thing.
