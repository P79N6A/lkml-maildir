I added the sysctl-based interface, and kept the modules parameters,
and updated the code in line with the 2.6 module parameter style.
See the "module_param_call" lines in fs/lockd/svc.c.
The module parameters "nlm_udpport" and "nlm_tcpport" _do_ work -- I
use them with my firewall.
For some reason, because modules don't need #ifdef MODULE any more, I
thought module_param*() entries would be automatically available as
boot parameters.  Silly me, that would be too obvious.
