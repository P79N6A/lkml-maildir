Subject: [M68KNOMMU 00/06]: move common ColdFire code to its own directory

Move common ColdFire CPU code into its own platform directory.
Currently the common ColdFire CPU family code sits in the
arch/m68knommu/platform/5307 directory. This is confusing, the files
containing this common code are in no way specific to the 5307 ColdFire.
Create an arch/m68knommu/platform/coldfire directory to contain this
common code. Other m68knommu CPU varients do not need use this code
though, so it doesn't make sense to move it to arch/m68knommu/kernel.
