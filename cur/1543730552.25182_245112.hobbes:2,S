Hmmm, why not reject RSS too then? It's the same thing.
If trs and drs and so on were kept, then rss would
just be the sum of them. Per-permission tracking
seems about right:
rss[perms] += change;
(where "perms" is rwx plus shared/private and dirty/clean)
At some point, it would be good to have per-vma rss.
This would be displayed by the pmap command's -x option.
(added to /proc/*/maps right before the filename)
