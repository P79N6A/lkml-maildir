Hi Marcelo,
Thanks! That was one of the main aims.

I believe I have tried to get it right, let me explain. lru_pages
is just used as the divisor for the ratio between lru scanning
and slab scanning. So long as it is kept constant across calls to
shrink_slab, there should be no change in behaviour.
The the nr_scanned variable is the other half of the equation that
controls slab shrinking. I have changed from:
   lru_pages = total_node_lru_pages;
   for each zone in node {
      shrink_zone();
      shrink_slab(zone_scanned, lru_pages);
   }
To:
   lru_pages = 0;
   for each zone in node {
      shrink_zone();
      lru_pages += zone_lru_pages;
   }
   shrink_slab(total_zone_scanned, lru_pages);
So the ratio remains basically the same
[eg. 10/100 + 20/100 + 30/100 = (10+20+30)/100]
2 reasons for doing this. The first is just efficiency and better
rounding of the divisions.
The second is that within the for_each_zone loop, we are able to
set all_unreclaimable without worrying about slab, because the
final shrink_slab at the end will clear all_unreclaimable if any
zones have had slab pages freed up.
I believe it generally should result in more consistent reclaim
across zones, and also matches direct reclaim better.
Hope this made sense,
Nick
