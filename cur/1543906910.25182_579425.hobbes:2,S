Peace Jeff  :)
In another mail, I gave an example with tmpreaper clearing out unused
files; if some of those files are only read and never modified,
tmpreaper would start deleting files which were still frequently used.
That's a regression, the way I see it. As for 'massive amounts of
users', well, tmpreaper exists in most distros, so it's possible it has
other users than just me.
