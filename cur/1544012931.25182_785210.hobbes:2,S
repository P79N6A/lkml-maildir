).
In the meantime I realized that the pcibios_enable_device() called from
pci_reenable_device() in the resume code path should be balanced by a "suspend"
call of the same kind.
Also, I decided to split the patch into a series of smaller patches with their
own changelogs to make it easier to follow the changes.  Perhaps this way
it will be more clear what I'm after.
The patches should apply to linux-next with the patch from
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=123039199607159&w=4
 on top.
Comments welcome.
Happy New Year to everyone,
Rafael
