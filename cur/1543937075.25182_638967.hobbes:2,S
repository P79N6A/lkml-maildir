The patch is wrong of course because when this is checked not 
all CPUs are booted yet. So it will always use TSC even when
multiple CPUs are going to be booted.
The right fix for Dean's problem would be probably to add a new 
parameter that disables CPU hotplug and forces smp_possible_map
to max_cpus, which could then be set with maxcpus=1 (or similar) 
I would not recommend to use nosmp or maxcpus=0 either because it will
disable the APIC and that is typically a bad thing (especially if you
need network performance)
