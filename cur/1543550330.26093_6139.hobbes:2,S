Indeed, for write throttling we have to find another
solution. One thing we could do is set different
trottle targets for different processes.
(so process A is trottled at 10% dirty pages while
process B is trottled at 40% dirty pages ... with
priorities being recalculated once every second or
so to preserve fairness)

Isn't it the case that for most of the filesystem
reads the current process is the one that is the
originator of the request ?
