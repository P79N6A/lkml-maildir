Now it happened again:
While I was using the pc with KDE, Evolution, Opera, Quanta+, Apache
(with only 3 processes for serving, limited by me) && MySQL so with a
lot of workload while opera was getting a page (presumably writting to
disk) the pc hangs. I can ping but I'have not any ssh or similar to get
a shell. Obviously I found ports 80, 443 and 3306(mysql) opened. I tryed
to connect with a browser and apache says no authorysation but I have
setted it to accept connections from all (probably apache cant read from
disk), while mysql crashed. I notice it because the mysql tcp port was
closed.
Now if you want me to try something else, I'll wait 2/3 hours for a 
mail. After that I'll reboot that pc hopping that my partitions arent
wihpped :)
If you have any suggestion, patch, test, request info I'll be happy to
fullfill it. Expecially sugestions on how make work at last for some
other time my hd if it is doable :)
Now Im really thinking that it is a hardware problem :(
Please CC me
