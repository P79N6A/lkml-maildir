Subject: [PATCH 0/7] fix setuid/setgid clearing in networked filesystems (take 6)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patchset is the latest one for fixing the clearing of setuid/setgid
bits in networked filesystems. It should apply cleanly to 2.6.23-rc4-mm1.
This is basically the same patchset as take 5. The main differences are
that the patches have been reordered to make the tree cleanly bisectable,
and the comment in notify_change is now a bit more descriptive. I've also
moved the description of the main rationale for the patch into patch 5.
Andrew, would it be possible to go ahead and get this committed to -mm?
