The fact is that there is _no_ interface to manage mtd.  Part of the
reason is this tradition to have seperate modules every couple of lines
of code.  In other subsystems, CONFIG_MTD_CHAR would not exist and the
code always be compiled in.  Simply to get _some_ interface to handle
the device that is always there.
Without going much deeper into that discussion, I consider it acceptable
to depend on CONFIG_MTD_CHAR for things like device removal.  If you
want device removal and explicitly don't want the extra code from
mtdchar.c, send a patch or go find 500 bytes to save elsewhere. ;)
With that out of the way, the question remains which interface we should
have.  Independently of mimicking loop, I would like to have a generic
interface for all mtd, not just block2mtd.  Whether it is "echo 1 >
/sys/.../mtd/mtdN/remove" or an ioctl(), I don't care much about.

Logfs can use a block device directly, which still leaves loop.
Enhancing block2mtd to work with files shouldn't be too hard.  If anyone
want a fun project to hack on...

Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized
things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data
structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
