It's looking much better.  But I _really_ want to actually test this on
real hardware.  As no one is shipping PCI Express hardware yet, there is
no rush to get this patch into the kernel tree.
Bill Irwin and I are working on getting some PCI Express hardware to
test this patch out on.  We've been promised some for a while, hopefully
it turns up soon...
thanks,
