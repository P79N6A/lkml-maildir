Just FYI:
http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/defrag/
http://sourceforge.net/projects/davtools/
defragmentation seems to be a minor issue.
After reiser3 (kernel 2.6.18.1 or so) crashed(*) badly with
some data loss on a production server can you recommed
a _safe_ and good performing filesystem for an
compile and test server (lots of small files).
(*) rm ~/Maildir while it was fed with courier-imap and
pressed CTRL-C to interrupt that trashed some of the files in
~/Maildir. It needed a --rebuild-tree.
Best greets,
Clemens Koller
