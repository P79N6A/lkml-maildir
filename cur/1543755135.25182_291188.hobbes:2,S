I've just checked Phil's mails - both Phil and myself are using
netfilter on the troublesome boxen.
Also, since FragCreates is zero, and this does mean that the frag_list
is not empty in all cases so far where ip_fragment() has been called.
(Reading the code, if frag_list was empty, we'd have to create some
fragments, which increments the FragCreates statistic.)
