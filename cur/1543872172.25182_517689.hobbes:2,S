"volatile" is really only needed if there is some side effect
that cannot be expressed to gcc which makes ordering over
the asm wrt. other pieces of code important.
But in these case it should absolutely not be needed.  It's
simply computing an interger result from some inputs and
some values in memory.  GCC should see perfectly fine what
is memory is read by the asm and therefore what ordering
constraints there are wrt. writes to the same memory location.
