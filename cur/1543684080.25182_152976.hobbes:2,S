           Summary: ide bus reset, never gets out of loop
    Kernel Version: Debian sid kernel 2.6.1 test i386
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: bzolnier@elka.pw.edu.pl
         Submitter: hjh@passys.nl
Distribution: Debian sid 
Hardware Environment: IBM Thinkpad i240 
Software Environment: Debian sid package 
Problem Description: On boot, the system always says the unmount was unclean, fsck 
necessary. The fsck loops at 64% on an ide bus reset (which it claims to be succcesfull), 
but at this point, it loops in an ide reset loop. 
The remedy: remove 2.6, mount unclean, do a manual fsck. 
Additional issue: this procedure (of resetting the ide controller) seems to have wrecked 
the boot sector, and some files on the root disk. 
Steps to reproduce: Install and use kernel 2.6 from Debian sid on an IBM i240
