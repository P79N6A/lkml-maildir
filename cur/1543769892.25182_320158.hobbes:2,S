I have both the server and client running  2.6.11.7 and have some severe
data corruption when reading from the server (maybe on write also I have
not tested).
If I copy the data over with scp or ftp I get correct data. Also  nfs
works OK with a mac os x 10.4 client.
Running gen.sh on the server and then cmp.sh on the client results in a
md5 checksum difference on 5-12 files I have never done one run where
there was no errors. 
This is what cat /proc/mounts reports on the nfs mount
:/export/home/ken /home/ken nfs rw,v3,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,hard,udp,lock,addr=amd 0 0
