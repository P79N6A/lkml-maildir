If I disable CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED, it is a lot better. I would not call it
optimal, though. 
Xorg has 20ms latency, gnome-terminal another 20ms latency. If I just press
a key (a letter for instance) to see how autorepeat fills terminal, one can
see that autorepeat is not smooth and it is stopping for a little while
(really extra short stops are visible but still visible). But  it is really 
a ton better that it was with fair group sched.
So, any conclusion? The case is closed or any further investigation should be 
done?
