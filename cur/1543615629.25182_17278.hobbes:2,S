I dumped that into my kernel source directory - it seems to have pretty
much inverted the problem:
rec now doesn't crash.
However, playback *does* now crash the machine.
It crashes at the same time as rec was crashing, at the end of the
playback, although this time it locks up on something as simple as:
cat anything > /dev/dsp
It manages to display the shell prompt again before crashing.
Its been several years since I attempted to do any kernel debugging - can
someone advise what I can do to get more info?
Ben
