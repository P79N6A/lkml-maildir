I'm sorry.  I thought that you said it *worked* with mem=63.  It looked
(still does) to me like you have 63 7/8M available.  (1M + 62 7/8M high
mem).  This has me confused, because HIGH_MEM is subtracted from the mem=
input before the region is added.
OTOH, if it is crashing with the e820 inputs and we just hand-feed it the
e820 results, we perhaps should expect crashes?  Guys?
I don't know what NVS stands for, it's in the ACPI spec.  I just know that
it is supposed to be "saved and restored across an NVS sleep".

I did mem=63M, not mem=64M. I can retry with mem=61M (but I think it
crashed, too.)

What is NVS? Non-volatile-storage?
