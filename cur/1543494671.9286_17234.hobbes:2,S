I've just downloaded the devfs patch, and I noticed one problem:
your patch supports dynamic block device MAJOR/MINOR's, but
it seems that the block device layer itself does not support
major's shared by multiple devices:
The problem is that the block device layer uses two dimensional arrays
for getting sector size, volume len etc. (MAJOR allocated by the system,
MINOR allocated by the indivitual driver), and that there are several
'switch'-statements with the MAJOR as parameter.
Do you know if there ere any plans to modify the block device layer to
support dynamic MAJOR's?
