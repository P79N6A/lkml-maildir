And inadequacies are what's causing libscg and 'cdrecord -scanbus' to fail
to list all IDE devices on Linux. Unless the comments about it stopping the
scan after getting -EPERM on one device are wrong.

From my point of view it's cdrecord that's confusing Linux users by trying
to force a completely different device naming method on users for no good
reason.

I could be wrong, but don't all of the other OSes that cdrecord and
libscg support access the device via the device node? When I mount
a device on Solaris I use /dev/c0t0d0s0 (or whatever it is)and not
0:0:0, right? So it would be safe to assume that users are used to
using that form of names for their devices, so why should cdrecord
be the odd man out?
Jim.
