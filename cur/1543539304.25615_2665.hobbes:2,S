Subject: [PATCH] Slimming down the new NLS code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/7/19/117

This patch removes the trailing zeroes on the NLS tables.  These are
unnecessary as GCC will pad them with zeroes implicitly.  This shaves
off 250k of source code, but there is still room for improvement.
