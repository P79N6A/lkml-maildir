   To handle the case of not having a separate TIME-WAIT table
   (sorry for being unclear). Or alternatively several conditionals. 
   
The TIME-WAIT half of the hash table is most useful on
clients actually.
I mean, just double the amount you "downsize" the TCP established
hash table if it bothers you that much.
Franks a lot,
