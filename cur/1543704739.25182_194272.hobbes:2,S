Another thing I noticed in last glibc CVS (nptl)
Thread stacks are also allocated in the 1GB quadrant :
nptl/sysdeps/x86_64/pthreaddef.h
/* We prefer to have the stack allocated in the low 4GB since this
   allows faster context switches.  */      
#define ARCH_MAP_FLAGS MAP_32BIT 
Is this really true ?
Is memory allocated in the low 4GB is faster on x86_64  (64bit kernel, 
64 bit user prog ?)
Thank you
