Hello, everyone, I have a problem when I try to load
my own loop device. I use the following command line
to compile my own loop device.
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/mzhu/linux/include -Wall
-DMODULE -DMODVERSIONS -include
/home/mzhu/linux/include/linux/modversions.h
-DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c myloop.c
It create the myloop.o file. Then I use the insmod
command to load the myloop.o . It returned the
following error.
myloop.o: unresolved symbol __put_user_bad
What is wrong? I couldn't find the prototype of
__put_user_bad. It was included in the
<asm/uaccess.h>. How to solve this problem?
Thanks.
Michael
