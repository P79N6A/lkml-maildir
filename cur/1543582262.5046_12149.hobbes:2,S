Thats wrong. The eepro100 is a great example. It works for most people, so 
the market for an improved one is very limited. Your market is not the 
whole community, only the community that needs something better. IBM will 
simply blame linux if it cant handle a situation. They arent supporting 
linux, they are only taking advantage of the fact that people want it.
BSDI is distributing FreeBSD now. They havent done anything useful to 
support it. They are just cashing in on it.
