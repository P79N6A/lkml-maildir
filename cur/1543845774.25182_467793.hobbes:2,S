We need to clean that output up a bit.  For a while x86 was printing "BUG:"
in front of both warnings and BUGs because Ingo through it made things
clearer - we've lost that.

Is OK - I'm pretty happy with what I have now.  I'll clump various patches
together and we can take another look at it.  I guess I'll merge the core
and x86, send x86_64 to Andi, let the ppc guys worry about the powerpc
bits.
