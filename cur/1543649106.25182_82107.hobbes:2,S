Resend #2 - no response to previous mails.
A change from 2.4.18 to 2.4.19 has broken the way that devfs maps
root=.  2.4.18 init/main.c::mount_root() has
        devfs_make_root (root_device_name);
        handle = devfs_find_handle (NULL, ROOT_DEVICE_NAME,
                                    MAJOR (ROOT_DEV), MINOR (ROOT_DEV),
                                    DEVFS_SPECIAL_BLK, 1);
where ROOT_DEVICE_NAME maps to the value of root= for non-initrd.  This
allowed devfs to remap an entry such as sda3 to whatever driver was
implementing sda3, even if that driver used a different major number.
The correct major was returned in handle.
2.4.19 init/do_mounts.c::mount_root() has
        devfs_make_root(root_device_name);
        create_dev("/dev/root", ROOT_DEV, root_device_name);
create_dev() has
	handle = devfs_find_handle(NULL, dev ? NULL : devfs_name,
                    MAJOR(dev), MINOR(dev), DEVFS_SPECIAL_BLK, 1);
The difference in 2.4.19 is that if dev is already set from
root_dev_names[] then devfs does NOT get the value of root=, forcing
the use of major from root_dev_names[].  If a driver reimplements one
of the standard device names and uses a different major or minor number
then it no longer works in 2.4.19 because devfs is given incomplete
information.
Quick and dirty workaround

But that probably breaks initrd.  What should that code be doing to
cope with both initrd and still allow devfs to remap root=?
