Thanks - that's good to know.
The suspicion arises because I have xfs on raid1 as root and have *never* had a 
problem with that filesystem. It's *always* xfs on lvm on raid5. I also have 
another system (previously discussed) that reliably hibernated xfs on raid6.
(Clearly raid5 is in my suspect list)

OK, that gave me an idea.
Freeze the filesystem
md5sum the lvm
hibernate
resume
md5sum the lvm
so:
haze:~# xfs_freeze -f /scratch/
Without this sync, the next two md5sums differed..
haze:~# sync
haze:~# dd if=/dev/video_vg/video_lv bs=10M count=200 | md5sum
200+0 records in
200+0 records out
2097152000 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 41.2495 seconds, 50.8 MB/s

haze:~# dd if=/dev/video_vg/video_lv bs=10M count=200 | md5sum
200+0 records in
200+0 records out

haze:~# echo platform > /sys/power/disk
haze:~# echo disk > /sys/power/state
haze:~# dd if=/dev/video_vg/video_lv bs=10M count=200 | md5sum
200+0 records in
200+0 records out
2097152000 bytes (2.1 GB) copied, 42.0478 seconds, 49.9 MB/s
f42539366bb4269623fa4db14e8e8be2  -
haze:~# xfs_freeze -u /scratch/
So the lvm and below looks OK...
I'll see how it behaves now the filesystem has been frozen/thawed over the 
hibernate...
