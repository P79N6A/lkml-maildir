Alan,
After noticing that drivers/pci/pci.ids was over nine months old, I
grabbed the latest list off of 
http://pciids.sourceforge.net
, modded it
to include a few recent submissions and to fix a couple of broken
lines, and created this patch. 
Let me know if you have any problems with it.
Thanks!
Matt Hartley
