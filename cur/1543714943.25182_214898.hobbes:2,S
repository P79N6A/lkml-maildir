Hi, 
 It seems in the alloc_pidmap() code (2.6), that for the first time when
the PIDs are allocated, the alternate entries in pidmap array is used.
Lets take an example,
    offset = pid & BITS_PER_PAGE_MASK;
    map = pidmap_array + pid / BITS_PER_PAGE;
  if pid == BITS_PER_PAGE, then we have
offset = 0;
map = pidmap_array[1];
as this is the first time allocation, so map->page == NULL,
Following code with get executed,
    if (!offset || !atomic_read(&map->nr_free)) {
next_map:
        map = next_free_map(map, &max_steps);
        if (!map)
            goto failure;
        offset = 0;
    }
This code will select pidmap_array[2] for pid selection even though no
pids are yet allocated from pidmap_array[1].
is this ok ?
please cc me
