Yes, you pointed this out to me, and I said that.  Very sorry, I got
busy with other things and I didn't follow through, my fault.

Yes, you are correct, they better be implemented properly, or they will
not work.

Um, I know a few distro makers that are going to implement this and are
seriously conserding shipping SELinux soon.  Debian included :)
And (ignoring the network hooks) there is not a measurable overhead for
these hooks.  We have documented this many times (OLS paper, USENIX
paper, etc.)  With the patch I'm about to submit, disabling the option
makes them go away entirely.
