Yes, i first create a RAW image of a disk. Then, i use this image file
as an image given to qemu. Inside qemu, running Minix i issue mkfs
/dev/c0d1 (this is corresponding to this image).

Well at least it is yet allowing to do so. And most things work like hell.

That is my all point actually, i am not telling i have a valid
partition. I'm just describing the fact that the minix fs driver is
making too many assumptions on the partition it is given. For sure
there must be something nasty about this image, as you told this is
the duty of the kernel not to mount such a partition if it is not a
partition. Here I was only giving an example of the way we could trick
the driver. This is as important as having the driver working
correctly on valid partitions i suppose.
