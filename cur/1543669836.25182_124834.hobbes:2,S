OK yeah. I thought you had more exotic techniques in mind

Well using the assumption that |head sector - target sector| gives
an ordering correstponding to seek time, we do sort the queue optimally.
I personally feel that being trickier than that is too much complexity.

I think just some averages, maybe histograms. Not quite sure exactly
how I'll need to do it. I probably want each IO submitting process'
average seek time, and the average seek time when changing from one
process to another. Nothing too fancy.

It is getting there. It definitely does some things much better than
deadline, although in other areas it is not so good.
