here are my problems :
1.
i implemented a file system on redhat linux 6.2 named
it pfs(peaceful file system). inserted it as a module
using insmod. got inserted peacefully.  the fs worked
on linux 6.2 :mouunted, ls, cat ,etc. .... But
consider the following problem:
	i unmount the dev i had mounted as a pfs file system.
then i try to rmmod the pfs module :
what i get is:
pfs: Device or resource busy.
i tried similar stuff with minix, ensured that the
module functionality of pfs, the include files of pfs
is identical to minix. 
STILL THE SAME TROUBLE.
	
2.
i compile this code on redhat 7.2 :   compiled ok
(after 
(i):-i made necessary changes in some functions which
had witnessed a change in their definitions, etc..
anyway fugget it
(ii):-got some directions while compiling regarding
the compile time options : tried them and things got
ok
). 
then i try to do insmod: result ...  i get many
functions as unresolved symbol. i check for the same
functions in ext3fs(which is added as a module to the
7.2's kernel).. i find the "unresolved" functions up
and working fine for ext3fs. i make sure that my
includes etc. are identical to ext3fs's : no use. 
i bang my head : no use.
so why this problem
