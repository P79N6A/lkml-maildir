I'd not mind something better than a hashtable. The fib tree may make
more sense than anticipated. It's truly better to switch data structures
completely than fiddle with e.g. hashtable sizes. However, bear in mind
the degenerate space behavior of radix trees in sparse contexts.

RCU'ing radix trees is trendy but the current implementation needs a
spinlock where typically radix trees do not need them for RCU. I'm
talking this over with others interested in lockless radix tree
algorithms for reasons other than concurrency and/or parallelism.

If you've got a microbenchmark that would be convenient for me to use
while addressing it, unless you'd prefer to take it on yourself.
Otherwise I can always write one myself.

I'd say you already have enough evidence to motivate a change of data
structure. Tree hashing (e.g. using balanced search trees in collision
chains) is generally good for eliminating straight-line issues of this
form but the available in-kernel tree structures don't do so well in
concurrent/parallel contexts and the utility of hashing becomes somewhat
questionable afterward given the stringent limits kernel environments
impose on pid spaces. I favor Peter Zijlstra's B+ trees once a few
relatively minor issues are addressed on account of good behavior in
sparse keyspaces, though cleanups (not stylistic) of radix trees' space
behavior may yet render them suitable, and may also be more popular to
pursue.
Basically all that's needed for radix trees' space behavior to get
fixed up is proper path compression as opposed to the ->depth hack.
Done properly it also eliminates the need for a spinlock around the
whole radix tree for RCU.

I needed to note that because it and my description were in direct
conflict. I'd rather leave it for a kernel janitor or someone who needs
to get patches under their belt to sweep up as I've got enough laurels
to rest on and other areas where I can get large amounts of code in
easily enough, provided I get my act together on various fronts.
