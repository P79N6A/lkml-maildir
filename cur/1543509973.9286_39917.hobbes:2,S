Hello,
I'd like to know which file operations are permitted on a pipe created
by the corresponding system call: Is it possible (and legal) to get the
number of bytes in the pipe using lseek and is there a way to peek into
the pipe? Is the pipe disposed when one of the two handles is closed,
and what is the state of the other handle then?
