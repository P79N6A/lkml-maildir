there are 2 little errors in my last posting - sorry.
the #include "shmem.h" is obsolate.
additionally, you have to increase yous shared memory limit
on standard installations:
echo 2500000000 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax
echo 2500000000 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmall
- my shell command to start the processes has a wrong char.
for ((i=1;i<200;i++)); do ./shm 1000 30 1234 0 & sleep 1; done
