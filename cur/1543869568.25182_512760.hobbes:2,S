because this type of compount interface is really painful for the user.
the module.param=foo syntax makes sure paramaters can be used without
endless documentation for each and every single of them, and makes
sure module writers don't introduce bugs in their own parser reimplementations.
Rusty, was it intentional that drivers can use __module_param_call?
Do you think the ubi use here is okay?
