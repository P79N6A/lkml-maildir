Ok. One step further now. The syntax seems correct now. I tried to grant 
capabilities to the user's shell:
roesrv01~ # setpcaps cap_ipc_lock+e 2864
[caps set to:
= cap_ipc_lock+e
]
Failed to set cap's on process `2864': (Operation not permitted)
and with the setcap tool again:
roesrv01~ # setcap cap_ipc_lock+e a.out
Failed to set capabilities on file `a.out'
  (Function not implemented)
Hmmm. What do we do now?

Ok, this would explain it. But what role plays the pseudo-filesystem in 
this case? I don't have it mounted. Isn't it only needed when using 
mmap, not shmget? I guess, I have a serious lack of knownledge here.
