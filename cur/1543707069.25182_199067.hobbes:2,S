Yes, definitely.  There are a *lot* of spare sectors on a modern IDE
drive -- Running out of spares is an extremely rare event, and usually
indicates that the drive has been operating in severe conditions for
its lifetime.  (>55C + vibe sorts of things)

Yes, because at that point, there's nothing to remap.  If the drive
couldn't read it, and knows it isn't in its 2/8MB cache, remapping is
pointless until there is known-good data to apply.  Therefore, only on
the write is there a good reason to examine and possibly remap an LBA.

Agreed.
In most cases, a simpe write to the supposedly-defective LBA will get
the drive to resolve whether it is a permanent media defect that needs
to be remapped, or else functional media that has gone bad for some
other reason. (of which there are several... excessive cold/heat,
vibration, poor power, etc)
