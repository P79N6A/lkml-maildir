Oops, Sorry, you're right. I seem to be really getting confused
between NFS versions now. Does this occur with linux-2.2.8 or newer?
I think that error was part of the 'msg_controllen' corruption that
was fixed there. Certainly if you're seeing NFS packets arriving to
your client, there is no reason for the RPC layer to be returning
-ECONNREFUSED, so that indeed sounds like a corruption of the UDP
stack.
As for the VFAQ: there is no official FAQ so far, but the portmapper
thing is documented with extreme prejudice multiple times in
Dejanews. It wasn't the problem in your case, so please accept my
apologies for the somewhat brusque tone of my reply.
Cheers,
 Trond
