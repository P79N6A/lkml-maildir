Would you like to share your tmpfs loop swap load with me, so I could reproduce
it on my machines? Do your machines run at i386 mode or x86-64 mode? How much
memory do your machines have?

﻿As I know little about your workload, I just guess from 'loop swap load' that
your load eats memory quickly and kernel/swap is started to keep a low free
memory.
Commit ﻿9b2cd506e5f2117f94c28a0040bf5da058105316 is just a method to increase
the page order for slub so there more free objects available in a slab. That
promotes performance for many benchmarks if there are enough __free__ pages.
Because memory is cheaper and comparing with cpu number increasing, memory
is increased more rapidly. So we create commit
9b2cd506e5f2117f94c28a0040bf5da058105316. In addition, if we have no this
commit, we will have another similiar commit to just increase slub_min_objects
and slub_max_order.
However, our assumption about free memory seems inappropriate when memory is
hungry just like your case. Function allocate_slab always tries the higher
order firstly. If it fails to get a new slab, it will tries the minimum order.
As for your case, I think the first try always fails, and it takes too much
time. Perhaps alloc_pages does far away from a checking even with flag
__GFP_NORETRY to consume extra time?
Christoph and Pekka,
Can we add a checking about free memory page number/percentage in function
allocate_slab that we can bypass the first try of alloc_pages when memory
is hungry?

I guess your machines have different memory quantity, but your workload
mostly consumes specified number of pages, so the result percent is
different.

oprofile data and 'slabinfo -AD' output might help.
