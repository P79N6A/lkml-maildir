This is exactly the behaviour we want.  If we don't block the caller then
the only option is to fail the call_usermodehelper() attempt, which would
be very bad indeed.
The main reason for calling call_usermodehelper(wait=0) is that the caller
holds locks which will prevent the helper application from terminating.  I
guess my proto-patch risks the same deadlock, because all the
currently-running helpers may be waiting on that lock.
Maybe this is why you were allocating a copy of the call_usermodehelper()
arguments?  I didn't try to reverse-engineer your patch to that extent -
I'd prefer to hear the design in your own words.  Am still waiting for
this, btw.
Allocating a whole bunch of buffers to hold copies of the
call_usermodehelper() args also uses resources, of course.  But it should
be acceptable.  We'd allocate the same amount of memory if we were sending
messages up a socket/pipe to userspace, which is what we should always have
done, instead of the direct-exec - it's caused tons of trouble.
You didn't answer half the questions in my previous email, btw.
Right now, I cannot think of any solution apart from:
- In the sync path, take the semaphore
- In the async path, take a copy of the args, then pass them over to some
  kernel thread which takes the args off a list one-at-a-time, takes the
  semaphore for each one, execs the helper and drops the semaphore on the
  exit path.
