Well, I am at a loss now or any idea what to do next.  I have tried 
everything this morning to build this an eliminate the problem.  
Whatever I do, kernel builds nice, boots nice and no problems... 
except for these NIC timeouts - it makes 2.6.3 totally unusable for 
me.
I state again, these _very_same_ cards work perfectly under any other 
kernel I have ever used over the last 3 years (like I am back on 
2.6.2 right now).
