That's a fair point. Hugh dislikes it too, I see ;) What to do... I
had been toying with the idea that if slqb (or slub) becomes "the"
allocator, then we could rename it all back to slAb after replacing
the existing slab?
Or I could make it a 128 bit allocator and call it SLZB, which would
definitely make it "the final" allocator ;)
