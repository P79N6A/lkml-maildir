AFAICT, it's 'for future expansion', NMC. I'll trim it down. Either way,
that enable seems to work, at least on my machine. As I don't know much
about it, I can't say what's right/wrong.
(I don't have the spec. Only code that does desired thing)

This is idle loop, like we're not doing anything, and if somebody is to
preempt us, then it sure means we're not supposed to idle.
Second point is (I'm _really_ on thin ground here..) that if we get_cpu()
here, and other CPU is sleeping, then it'd be woken up sooner, for cache
will need syncing.

done.

Zwane told me to use synchronize_kernel(); it cured my crashes on rmmod
amd76x_pm. -> hack removed.

done.
