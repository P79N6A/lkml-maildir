I got bored, so I decided to make a URN copy of that for people with Squid 1.2
proxies:
Menu of all FTP proxies:
urn:menu.jordy.wserv.com:ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/
Menu of all WWW proxies:    urn:menu.jordy.wserv.com:www.kernel.org/pub/linux/
If you are using Squid 1.2 with ICMP pinging enabled, it'll even tell you how
far away each of the mirrors is from you.
To go directly to 2.2b1 source, go to:
urn:jordy.wserv.com:ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/linux-2.2.0-pre1.tar.gz
or
urn:jordy.wserv.com:www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2/linux-2.2.0-pre1.tar.gz
Be warned tho, Squid's implementation of URNs seems a bit flakey :)
