And the way to get the accounting right (I think) is actually truly 
trivial: we should initialize the task count to _two_ at process creation 
time, since we have two users (the parent who will do the wait, and our 
own usage).
This should mean that we'd actually have the process count right, and 
wouldn't need the games we play right now. Ie the patch should be 
something like the appended (which again is totally untested, it might 
easily have serious problems, that's not really the point. The point is 
that reference counting is the only sane memory management policy, and we 
did it wrong).
