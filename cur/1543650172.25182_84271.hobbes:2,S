Snapshot is available at 
http://www.namesys.com/snapshots/
:
reiser4 proper:
http://www.namesys.com/snapshots/reiser4-2002.10.24.tar.gz
necessary changes to the core kernel, plus some UML patches, plus some
patches for debugging:
http://www.namesys.com/snapshots/reiser4-core-2002.10.24.diff
utils:
http://www.namesys.com/snapshots/reiser4progs-2002.10.24.tar.gz
I shall produce newer snapshot to-morrow.
It does work, but code is not production quality yet. Do *NOT* put
