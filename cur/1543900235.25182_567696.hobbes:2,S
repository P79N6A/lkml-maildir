I only have 512 MB of memory on my Athlon64 desktop box, and I switch between -mm and mainline kernels regularly.  I have noticed that -mm is always much more responsive, especially first thing in the morning.  I believe this has been due to the new schedulers in -mm (because I notice an improvement in mainline now that CFS has been merged), as well as swap prefetch.  I haven't tested swap prefetch alone to know for sure, but it seems pretty likely.
My workload is compiling kernels, with sylpheed, pidgin and firefox[1] open, and sometimes MonoDevelop if I want to slow my system to a crawl.
I will be getting another 512 MB of RAM at Christmas time, but from the other reports, it seems that swap prefetch will still be useful.
[1] Is there a graphical browser for linux that doesn't suck huge amounts of RAM?
