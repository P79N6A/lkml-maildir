Subject: a single fragmented IP packet kills the 2.4.0-t12 kernel

	It seems that a bad bug (in the netfilter code?) was exposed by
the changes from 2.4.0-t11 to t12. If a box has the ip_tables and
ip_conntrack modules loaded, sending it a single fragmented IP packet
(e.g. with "ping -s 65000") is enough to immediately freeze it. It does
not respond to the keyboard, does not write the oops(es) to disk... Some
people initially stumbled upon this when trying to use nfs, probably
because nfs uses large packets and therefore produces fragmented packets.
I also tried reverting the netfilter code to that of test11, but it dies
exactly in the same way, so that if the bug is in netfilter it was there
already.
By the way, the bug is only triggered when using netfilter in native mode:
the ipchains compatibility mode apparently works fine.
Does anybody have a clue? I need the stateful firewalling capabilities of
netfilter. I will gladly help, if possible. But I cannot connect a console
to the serial port to capture the oops...
And, since we are talking about fragments: where did the ip_always_defrag
switch that used to be in /proc/sys/net/ipv4 (in 2.2.x kernels) go? 
Bye, thanks
