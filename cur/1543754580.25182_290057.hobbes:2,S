Well, not everyone is subscribed to lm_sensors mailing list but
nonetheless are interested when a new subsystem is introduced into the
kernel. There several established subsystems (network, USB, ide) whose
maintainers people trust either because of the good track record or
because it affects small number of people so the main discussion is
kept on special lists. But even then most patches are presented on
LKML when issues ironed out on special list.
With a new subsystem it is wise to present it to LKML so it gets wider coverage.
