This is one of the most precise reports I have
|The system is an AMD K6-3 on a FIC PA-2013 mobo with 3 IDE disks.  The
|size of hda is 4.3 GB, the size of hdb is 854 MB and the size of hdc is
|1.2 GB.  Hdd is an IDE CDROM drive
I think its significant that two reports I have are FIC PA-2013 but not all.
What combination of chips is on the 2013 ?
