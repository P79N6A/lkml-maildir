And if root logs in to play a game of nethack, what then?

OK, how about telling us among Unices (or similar) which ones allow
overcommit or not be set. What is the default? How do they usually run?
Which ones don't allow overcommit at all? Please keep to recent versions; a
(rough) estimate of market share would be nice too.

By not overcommiting, that 90Mb process either doesn't get off the ground,
or nothing else can run at all. Even if the *potentially* 90Mb process
isn't using much memory ATM. And if the 90Mb process asks for memory a bit
at a time, it can get killed for trying to get memory which others have
reserved because they might use it, like 8Mb for stack for ls(1) asked to
see if file foo exists.

It isn't harder to predict than in the no overcommit case: Some process
gets killed, the one that happens to ask for memory when the system can't
commit more (essentially at random), or (much, much later in the life of
whatever got the system OOM) some probable culprit (Rik's patch).

Nonsense. Few people are prepared to shell out 5 times the needed RAM +
swap just in case everybody decides unanimously to change all pages at
their reach. True, there are applications where this is required, but they
are far in between.

Please, yet again: OOM is an extreme situation, if you let your system go
that far with any frequency then _you_ are broken, or the system is
hopelessly underspeced. If you add non-overcommit to a overworked machine
you get very predictable behaviour, i.e., none at all. Coding up any of the
wonderful "easy, non overcommiting schemes" is _hard_ and would need
extensive changes in the kernel (the kernel _does_ use memory, and such use
is not bounded today). This would undobtedly cost quite a bit in
performance, together with the performance loss of allocating swap space
for nothing. Getting that accounting 100% right (and keeping it that way!)
isn't easy either, so this is a huge project.
