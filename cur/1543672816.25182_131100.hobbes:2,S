	For those devices there is little difference conceptually
between using ifname to bind them to a known name and using ifconfig
to set the MAC address : you need to set the MAC address prior to any
operation, and when it's done, you have a MAC address so you can deal
with it like any other device.
	Anyway, those devices are so rare that I would not optimise
for them, and I would tradeof a bit more sanity for usual device in
exchange to a few complications for unusual devices.
	And I'm also perfectly well aware that some devices such IrDA
devices and PPP devices doesn't have a fixed 48bit address so can't be
handled with the scheme I propose. But those devices are usually
handled in their own way.
	Have fun...
