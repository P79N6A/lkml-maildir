Hmmmm ... I like this idea very much ... :))
Just one question: I looked at n_tty_receive_buf and I didn't see any
protection / warn back mechanism (the function is void) as to "what if the
room in the TTY buffer is too small to store all the data passed
directly by the driver". What happens if the driver passes a data amount
that's bigger than the available room in the TTY buffer??
I also looked at the Rocketport driver, and I didn't see anywhere a check
for this available TTY buffer space. Is there a way to do that?? Should we
do that??
Regards,
Ivan
