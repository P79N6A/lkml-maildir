Subject: [PATCH -mm] drivers/acpi/tables/tbutils.c: Shut up bogus uninitialized variable warning
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

drivers/acpi/tables/tbutils.c: In function 'acpi_tb_parse_root_table':
drivers/acpi/tables/tbutils.c:403:
warning: 'rsdt_address' may be used uninitialized in this function
has been verified to be a bogus warning. Let's just initialize the
variable to zero and shut this up.
Signed-off-by: Satyam Sharma <satyam@infradead.org>

I didn't use uninitialized_var() here because drivers/acpi/ is dual-licensed
stuff and used elsewhere, where that macro may be unavailable (?)
