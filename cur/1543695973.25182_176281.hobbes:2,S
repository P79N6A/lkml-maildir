sparc64 (Ultra 5 with onboard mach64), debian unstable.
With all Mach64 suboptions set to Yes:
drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c: In function `atyfb_init':
drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:2476: error: `XL_CHIP_ID' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:2476: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:2476: error: for each function it appears in.)
drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:2552: warning: implicit declaration of function `aty_ld_pll_ct'
drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:2341: warning: unused variable `lcd_ofs'
drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:2342: warning: unused variable `driv_inf_tab'
drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:2342: warning: unused variable `sig'
drivers/video/aty/atyfb_base.c:2342: warning: unused variable `rom_addr'
There are actually 2 lines with XL_CHIP_ID and this is not seen in any
other place under drivers/video/aty nor in include directory. Maybe
IS_XL(pdev->device) is the right thing?
