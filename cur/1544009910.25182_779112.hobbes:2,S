Subject: [PATCH][RFC 9/23]: SCST virtual disk backend handler
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch contains the SCST virtual disk backend device handler. This
is an SCST device handler that allows to export local files or local
block devices as SCSI devices through the SCST target framework. This
handler has three modes:
  - FILEIO mode, which allows to use files on file systems or block 
devices as virtual remotely available SCSI disks or CDROMs with benefits 
of the Linux page cache.
  - BLOCKIO mode, which performs direct block IO with a block device, 
bypassing page-cache for all operations. This mode works ideally with 
high-end storage HBAs and for applications that either do not need 
caching between application and disk or need the large block throughput.
  - NULLIO mode, in which no real IO is performed. It is intended for 
performance testing.
