Hmm...? I do not think so.
1. 'Makefile' stably exists already.
2. /tmp/tmp99825 is newly created.
 2a. Memory inode is allocated for /tmp/tmp99825.
 2b. But its correspoding data is garbage and points Makefile
     (Perhaps it is rare case..., I agree with you)
3. Crash here.
4. Valid memory inode is lost, garbage disk-inode is left
   pointing Makefile.

Yes, it is not so common case, but isn't rare case worth consideration?
