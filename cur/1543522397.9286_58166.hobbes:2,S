Ok. When  check can buy you something ? When filesystem was marked as clean
but when there are broken superblocks anyway. Only two cases exists:
  1. System crashed due software or hardware error while sutting down so
it's marked clean but not superblocks are Ok.
  2. There are some nasty error in ext2fs kernel code (or even more subtle
bug in non-ext2fs kernel code: usually bug in kernel will oops and/or lock
kernel and it should be REALLY weird bug to not crash kernel but force it
to write wrong superblocks on disk).
If you are not playing with development kernels both have near zero
probability.
