It looks ok, but it would really be good if we could indicate if the
read actually was successful.  Right now some platforms can detect
faults and do not have a way to get that error back to the driver in a
sane manner.  If we were to change the read* functions to look something
like:
	int readb(void *addr, u8 *data);
it would be a world easier.
Now I'm not saying I want to change the existing interfaces to support
this, that's too much code to change for even me (and is a 2.7 thing.)
Just wanted to put this idea in people's heads that we need to start
planning for something like it.
thanks,
