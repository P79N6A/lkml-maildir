I guess I am a sucker for no-transient-buffer (bufferless?)
implementations, as with them there is an intrinsic
simplicity that automatically avoids problems.  The price
in this case, though, is the use of the more expensive
get_user() where, for kernel buffers, it is not needed.
I have no objection though, and in either case we should
impose a sanity check on 'count'.
