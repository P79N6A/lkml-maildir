Yup, I think they're all within the noise level between anon_mm and anon_vma,
though both are faster than partial by something at lease statistically
significant (though maybe not even enough to care about for these 
workloads).

Yeah, it does 5 passes, and throws away the fastest and slowest. So it's
only 3 it's calculating off ... I think you just got lucky with a 0.0% ;-)
That's the most stable way I found of getting consistent results.

OK, great ... thanks for the info. I think I'd happily pay that cost in
pgd_alloc for the space gain - kernbench & SDET are about as bad as it
gets on pgd_alloc, so that seems like a good tradeoff.

IIRC, with PAE etc on, mainline is 44 bytes. So if we saved 8 from Andrew's
change, and 4 from objrmap, I'd be hoping for 32?
