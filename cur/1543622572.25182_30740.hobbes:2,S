Ok guys,
Maybe you'll respect the ideas coming from Andreas Dilger, as some of you
obviously don't like some of my ideas.
Here goes:

Well, my idea on this is that you don't check the link count at all.  Why
should it be special if I delete /home/adilger/foo, when it is also linked
to /home/adilger/bar?  If I want to undelete /home/adilger/foo, then I
should be able to.  Since it is on the same filesystem, it doesn't take any
more space in the filesystem to keep this link, and in fact avoids the
race condition entirely.
Only the undelete daemon would do real deletions, everything else would
_always_ do something like:
base=`echo $file | sed "s#$mntpt/##"` 
mv $file $mntpt/.undelete/$base[.timestamp/username/etc]

Well, my take on this would be that since we are only ever moving files over
to .undelete, then we are never using up more space than what we are already
using, so we do not need to ever synchronously free space to delete a file.
We could always have unlink() write to a socket (e.g. .undelete/daemon or so)
telling it which file it just deleted, and the daemon sleeps on this socket
until woken to see if it needs to do cleanup.  Having the name of the
recently deleted file passed in allows it to do things like clean up old
copies of that file quickly, etc.
Note also that the "unrm" command would need some smarts so that it can
match against variations of $base, because programs may rename a file,
make a new copy, and then delete the renamed file (e.g. emacs, vi, etc).
It would probably do some sort of regexp on the basename() of the file.
Cheers, Andreas
