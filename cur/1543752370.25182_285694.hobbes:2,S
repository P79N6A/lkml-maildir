You are very confused. The "stuff" that comes from the
kernel, printk(), etc., is buffered by the kernel and
then read by user-mode code from /proc/kmsg.
But, once you read it, it's gone. Therefore there is
a procedure,  int syslog(int type, char *buf, int buf_len);
that allows a user to read/manuiplate the logging
facility. `man syslog` will get you that information.
You do __not__ use _syscall3(). See the underscore in
the name? Things that begin with underscores are used by
the 'C' runtime library, not you directly.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/syslog.h>
int main() {
     char buf[0x2000];
     syslog(3, buf, sizeof(buf));
     puts(buf);
     return 0;
}
Cheers,
