Looking closer, the commit after that is a _real_ merge, and it looks like 
you did something strange when that at first conflicted in saa7134-dvb.c 
or something. I just don't even see _how_ you created that bogus non-merge 
commit. Are you using cogito? It has some problems with conflict 
resolution, I think. Real git should not even have allowed you to commit 
something that hadn't been resolved.
Anyway, if you want to fix this up without re-doing _everything_, the way 
to do so is to just start a new branch, and cherry-pick the non-crap 
commits. So you can fix it up, largely automatedly, with git.
I'm actually trying to do that right now, to see if I can re-create your 
tree without the errors.
