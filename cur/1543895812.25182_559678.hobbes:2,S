Could it be we need to reset the state machine at this point before we
touch the registers again - that wouldn't be the first controller with
this limit and undocumented.
On the 370 we already 
Linas; For the debug on the libata one turn on ATA_DEBUG and
ATA_VERBOSE_DEBUG in include/linux/libata.h and it should spew
diagnostics before the freeze. I suspect thats a different problem to the
hang you see now but I'd like to debug both.
