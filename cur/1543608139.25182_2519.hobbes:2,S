Well it is not. I already had that discussion in private with someone
else. 
In previous versions (changed in a 14pre), there was two definitions for
TCP_HP_BITS. Now there is _just_ this one.
~(OLD_TCP_RESERVED_BITS)|TCP_FLAG_ECE_|TCP_FLAG_CWR == ~(NEW_TCP_RESERVED_BITS)
with
OLD_TCP_RESERVED_BITS = __constant_htonl(0x0FC00000),
NEW_TCP_RESERVED_BITS = __constant_htonl(0x0F000000),
So you see that I did _not_ change the value of TCP_HP_BITS. You surely
have noticed that change was not 'needed' since 
~(NEW_TCP_RESERVED_BITS) == (~(NEW_TCP_RESERVED_BITS)|TCP_FLAG_ECE|TCP_FLAG_CWR)
But it is _much_ cleaner that way (at least imho)

As I've stated, this change fixes the unclean target. Furthermore, some
cosmetic changes must be done to the LOG targets. It is trivial and
should be posted to netfilter-devel. I will do it as soon as this patch
will be accepted. But if you want to see a preview of those, just drop
me a message.
