From Markus Kuhn's excellent Unicode FAQ:
"The official name and spelling of this encoding is UTF-8, where UTF
stands for UCS Transformation Format. Please do not write UTF-8 in any
documentation text in other ways (such as utf8 or UTF_8), unless of
course you refer to a variable name and not the encoding itself."
