Yes and that's what we have been saying all along. When you want 
performance, you use SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN and let the allocator do its job. 
I don't see much point from API point of view for the caller to explicitly 
ask for a given alignment and then in addition pass a 'yes I really meant' 
flag (SLAB_DEBUG_OVERRIDE).
So Christoph, unless you can point out a specific problem with my patch, 
I'll queue it up to Andrew. Thanks.
