Because there are some arches that don't have kernel/Kconfig.preempt,
its earlier home.  Therefore, putting it into kernel/Kconfig.preempt
broke those arches' builds by supplying neither PREEMPT_RCU nor
CLASSIC_RCU.

Do you have a suggested location?

I don't expect additional drop-in replacements for RCU, though people
are certainly free to experiment if they wish.  It is a choice because
this gives people a very clear idea of the two options and because
it makes the implementation a bit cleaner.
