You want the "newgrp" utility.
From the manpage:
       Newgrp  changes  the group identification of its caller, analogously to
       login(1).  The same person remains logged in, and the current directory
       is  unchanged, but calculations of access permissions to files are per-
       formed with respect to the new group ID.
       If no group is specified, the GID is changed to the login GID.
