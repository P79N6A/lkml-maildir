Hi Eloy.
I have multiple ethernet pcmcia/cardbus cards.
3c589
3c575 (CB)
and a xir2ps
The only one that doesn't work is 3c589.
I don't believe david hinds is doing any work on the pcmcia/cardbus drivers
in the 2.3 kernel.
In 2.3.45 (or was it 2.3.44, I forget now, 2.3 is coming out a little
quicker than I can try it <g>) yenta appears to allocate 2 irqs before hand
and when a pcmcia card is inserted into that slot (using pcmcia cardmgr
v3.1.8), it allocates another IRQ for it.  But this paragraph is OT of the
subject.
