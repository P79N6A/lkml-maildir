e100_read_command is a variable that is either 1 for reads
or 0 for writes. This variable is set in e100_dma_write and
e100_dma_read. As long as the framework calls dma_write or 
dma_read before it calls dma_begin it will work just fine.
The driver has been tested with a ext2 filesystem on a disk 
(and the files are still there after a sync and reboot).
