i dont really understand your point. _if_ current->need_resched is set we
should reschedule ASAP - thats all. Thats a generic kernel rule - it's up
to the scheduling code to balance timeslices and priorities properly. The
patch is only enforcing this rule more accurately than old kernels. But if
you think this is something new then you are wrong.

wrong. The behavior of X & screensaver does not change the slightest from
current kernels. The patch adds no additional behavior! We check for
need_resched at _every_ system-call return (or IRQ return to user-space,
or signal delivery) anyway. The patch only shortens certain longer
'scheduling atoms' by either splitting them up into smaller pieces or by
redesigning them. But this does not cause any macro-effect - apart from
situations of course which are now behaving correctly.
[btw. 99% of the time the X client gets rescheduled is not due to
need_resched but due to the unix-domain socket buffer running out of write
space. And this is true globally, need_resched itself is resposible for a
small fraction of reschedules only.]
