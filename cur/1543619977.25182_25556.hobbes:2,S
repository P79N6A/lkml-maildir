Done ;-)

The current patch does A.  Another option is to change the reiserfs open
code to detect the tail and do an -EINVAL for o_direct.  This gives the
application a better way to fall back to normal open methods than returning
an error during the read.
Just to restate, the current O_DIRECT code can never hit a reiserfs tail in 
the normal case.  By definition, reiserfs tails are not block aligned, and 
O_DIRECT writes are.  The only time it is a concern is with a screwy 
interaction between expanding truncates and tails on kernels < 2.4.17.  
Since most O_DIRECT users are databases, and tails are never created on
files > 16k in size, I don't expect anyone to ever see the reiserfs 
triggered -EINVAL from the current patch (famous last words).
