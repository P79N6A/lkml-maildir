lazy-readahead has no role to play here. The readahead window got closed
because the i/o pattern was totally random. My guess is multiple threads
are generating 16k i/o on the same fd. In such a case the i/os can  get
interleaved and the readahead window size goes for a toss(which is
expected  behavior)
Well if this is infact the case: the question is
	1. does the i/o pattern really has some sequentiality to 
		deserve a readahead?
	2. or should we ensure that the interleaved case be somehow
		 handled, by including the size parameter?
I know Nick has implied option (2) but I think from the readahead's
point of view it is (1),
