Nope, I get consistently 12e6 bytes/sec, which is 96e6 bits/sec  
across 100Mbps ethernet, fitting nicely with the frame overhead (some  
50 bytes out of 1500, without TCP options). So no lie here. With  
gigabit I'm not completely sure yet, still have to see the advertised  
125e6 symbols/sec (got only as far as 115e6 up to now).
Ciao,
