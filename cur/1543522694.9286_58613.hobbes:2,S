Hi,
You can give the hope to your friend. Now I'm finishing debugging of Linux 
driver for the Rockwell (Conexant) RipTide Audio Card (that is installed in 
HP Pavillion) and the Conexant ICH Audio Card. The driver is designed as 
loadable module and replaces standard OSS driver when it is being installed.
I hope that beta version of the driver will be available in February.
Best Regards.
