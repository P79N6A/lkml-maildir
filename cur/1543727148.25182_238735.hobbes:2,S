Ok, now I have tested it for 6 hours without crashing the driver. The 
system's load has been something like 5-6 the whole time. I also made some 
network load with ~90Mbps-incoming and ~90Mbps-outgoing traffic. 
I haven't had time to test anything else but I'm quite sure that there is 
no need for that anymore because the stability we have reached. 
I'll let you know if there's any problems within next few days but I would 
recommend that those patches would be included in 2.6.8. (without that "if 
(received > 0) {").
Many thanks for your help to resolve this problem. 
Hector, have you tested these patches?
