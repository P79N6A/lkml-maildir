I think the patch is correct, just a question,

This patch assumes that nobody else calls __wait_on_bit_lock() with
action which can return !0. Currently this is correct, but perhaps
it makes sense to move this wake_up_page() into __wait_on_bit_lock ?
Note that we need to "transfer" the wakeup only if wake_up_page()
has already removed us from page_waitqueue(page), this means we
don't need to check ret != 0 twice in __wait_on_bit_lock(), afaics
we can do
	if ((ret = (*action)(q->key.flags))) {
		__wake_up_bit(wq, q->key.flags, q->key.bit_nr);
		// or just __wake_up(wq, TASK_NORMAL, 1, &q->key);
		break;
	}
IOW, imho __wait_on_bit_lock() is buggy, not __lock_page_killable(),
no?
