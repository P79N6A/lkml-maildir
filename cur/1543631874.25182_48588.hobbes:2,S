It certainly could be. If bits 29-31 maybe control things like memory
timings then it could do quite horrible things. Fixing it to leave the
ERRSTS register alone and keep bits 29-31 is definitely worth trying. If
that fixes it then its going to be easy enough to drop a fix into the
mainstream code
