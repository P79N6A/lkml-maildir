Hello,
No matter how much harddisk activity is occuring on my system, the 
harddisk LED stays off.  At first I thought I'd misconnected the lead, 
but under Windows the light is functional.
This occurs on both my SATA harddisk and my PATA harddisk.
SATA controller: Silicon Image sil3112
PATA controller: NForce2
Motherboard    : Abit NF7-S 2.0
CPU            : AthlonXP 3000+
The earliest kernel I've used with this hardware is 2.6.6, and the 
problem occurs right up to 2.6.8.1.
I'm completely clueless as I was under the impression that the hardware 
controlled the LED.
Could I please be CC'd any replies as I'm not subscribed to the list.
Regards,
Ben Skeggs
