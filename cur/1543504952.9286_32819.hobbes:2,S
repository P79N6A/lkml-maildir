I couldn't do it, because I have never wade into the ISDN code. But once
I know: There was a big ISDN update in v2.3.4 and recent cards 
(e.g. AVM A1 PCMCIA) run with stock kernels since then.
The ISDN people should wipe the tomatoes from their eyes and accept
this as new base for their development.
