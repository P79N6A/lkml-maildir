CPU utilisation. Each new application has to calculate it (ps, top, qps,
kps, various sysmons, procmons, etc.). Wouldn't it be worth it having a
syscall for that? Wouldn't it be more optimal?

Well, what I mean was - don't these structures contain the information I
am looking for? Let's start from the end - 2.4, then what's the difference
with 2.2 and finally 2.0?
