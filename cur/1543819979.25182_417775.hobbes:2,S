Ok, that was pretty foolish of me to attempt.  We could move all of the
inline functions in security.h to a .c file for when the LSM framework
is enabled, but that might cause some slowdowns.  Although I remember
that Kurt Garloff did some work in this area in the past, showing that
moving these out of inline caused some improvements on ia64.
Anyway, for now I'm not going to worry about this, it isn't that
important...
Sorry for the noise.
