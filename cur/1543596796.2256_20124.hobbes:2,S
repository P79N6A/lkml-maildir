Thanks for the freedback guys.

I don't like goto's either but in this function the structure kinda demands
it. Lot's of points where you fail and need to release an increasing list of
resources. Not sure a list of labels like this is any better.
    err_out_free_iqrx:
    err_out_free_iqtx:
    err_out_free_irq:
    err_out_iounmap:
    err_out_free_mmio_region:
    err_out_free_mmio_region0:
    err_out:
I've left this one as it is for the present. I have removed the gotos from
fst_open() however.

Fixed that one, although it did add a "goto error_6" :-(

Quite correct. Un-helpful information hiding. I've unwound the macros in
place and removed them.

Not quite sure what you mean here. I have corrected the code so that BUF_OFFSET
sees a consistent argument.

I think mine is clearer but then I've always bumped and wrapped pointers and
indexs that way. Another alternative would be:
    port->txpos = ( port->txpos + 1 ) % NUM_TX_BUFFER;
Looks cleaner than both and lets the compiler decide, but if the % operator
produces a div operation instead of a mask on even one processor type then I
think we lose. If anyone can prove there's an optimal way to do this sort of
bump and wrap operation I'll gladly adopt it.
And finally one from Alan Cox:

Oh God! how did I miss that one!
And after I'd taken the NT driver writers to task over the same issue :(
Still corrected now.
