Hi,
[ Please CC me replies. ]
This is 2.2.14 (on Alpha, but this probablem is probably universal).
The bttv driver compiles fine as a part of the kernel, but fails to
load as a module, giving the error:
/lib/modules/2.2.14/misc/bttv.o: unresolved symbol init_mm
The msp3400 driver does the exact same thing.
What can be done to fix this?
Thanks,
John Goerzen
