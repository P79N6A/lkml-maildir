Hello, 
  As some may know I have been working on em86 , however I have a problem 
I can't seem to find an answer to . Whenever I run em86 I get the following 
error message: 
./em86: Unknown relocation type 
My issue is how is this possible. 
- I have compared the headers (elf structure) and there appears to be no 
differences. 
- There is a linker directive file but It dosen't seem to cause other 
programs to generate this message. 
The real problem lies in the fact 6.0 ld.so has assertions turned on. This 
causes the excutable not to run ( even though it can.) 
Any pointers would be VERY helpful. 
Thank You 
Leslie Donaldson
