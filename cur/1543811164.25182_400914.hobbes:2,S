This conflicts in intent with Stas's patch:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16-rc4/2.6.16-rc4-mm2/broken-out/x86-early-printk-handling-fixes.patch
that patch solves the same problem, and I think in a slightly better way:
at least there's a chance that some of those (potentially useful)
bootloader messages are still visible when the kernel goes tits up.
Of course, the best fix would be to start the kernel messages at the next
line after the bootloader, but I guess that info would be hard to locate.
