I think reloading CS is the right thing to do. IMO it is not sane to
depend on that the 64-bit boot loader sets up CS to 0x18 for us.
Having a dependency like that (unless there is a good reason and it is
documented somehow) is good to avoid, regardless of 64-bit uncompress or
not. I mean, if you plan on making the bzImage code 64-bit then it needs
to reload CS too, right?
