No, we can't do this, this makes flush_workqueue() meaningless.
Even if we could, this can't help. Suppose that a kernel thread takes some
global lock (for example, in our case cache_reap() takes cache_chain_mutex)
and then it is preempted by RT task which doesn't relinquish CPU.
So this problem is "wider", flush_workqueue() was just a random victim.
