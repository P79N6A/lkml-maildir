But that's a different error.  Robert (Day) reported:
 rpmdb: unable to join the environment
 error: db4 error(11) from dbenv->open: Resource temporarily unavailable
 error: cannot open Packages index using db3 - Resource temporarily unavailable (11)
 error: cannot open Packages database in /var/lib/rpm
but then again, there's no way in which the patch which we're discussing
could cause EAGAIN.
Has anyone straced a failing rpm command?
