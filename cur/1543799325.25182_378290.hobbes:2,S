The point is _exactly_ as the above quotation between Andrew Morton
and myself.  I'm sure it's not me being thick because it's absolutely
damned obvious from the above.
Andrew said: "Yes, it's basically always wrong to include asm/foo.h
when linux/foo.h exists."
That statement is a rule.  I assert that this is an incorrect statement
and I assert that there is a proven case where this statement is incorrect.
Hence, to avoid people reading Andrew's misleading statement, I followed
up on precisely _that_ point and _that_ point alone.
