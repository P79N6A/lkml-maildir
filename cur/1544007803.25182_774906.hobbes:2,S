Any chance we can have this in drivers/Kconfig?
Just wrap all of the file in an
if X86
.....
endif
So we keep all the drivers/ stuff in one Kconfig file and
not spread all over.

Can this be included in drivers/Makefile like this:
obj-$(CONFIG_X86) += x86/
Notice that parisc already do the same. (Yes they have
a drivers/parisc dir).
We shall try to visit our tree in natural order when we build
and such a rule breaks this.
Also it is good to keep drivers/ stuff in one place.

This is not needed. I can see divers/misc uses the same
but it is bogus.
