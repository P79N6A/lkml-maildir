You are right, especially if that user is glibc.  Here is my updated patch:
From: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>
Subject: [PATCH] sysctl:  Scream if someone uses sys_sysctl
As far as I can tell we never use sys_sysctl so I never expect to see
these messages.  But if we do see these it means that there are user
space applications that need to be fixed before we can safely
remove sys_sysctl.
Limited to only 5 messages in case something like glibc is using sys_sysctl.
