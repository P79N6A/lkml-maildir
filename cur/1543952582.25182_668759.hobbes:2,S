This breakage is shown up when compiled with a config which doesn't have
CONFIG_PM set.  It is a common error to only test with that turned on
and I am sure that this is just one of a number of bugs that have been
picked up by real machine configs.
Perhaps it would be worth having one of your integration test runs be
with a configuration with CONFIG_PM disabled so that they get detected
earlier in the process.
