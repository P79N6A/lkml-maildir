Hi there.
Hopefully, somebody here can advise me...
The system in question is a Toshiba T2110 laptop, i486dx4/75
processor, 12M of RAM, and a PCMCIA network adapter that is NE2000
compatible. The 800M HD is partitioned as follows: 
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
% fdisk -l /dev/hda
Disk /dev/hda: 32 heads, 63 sectors, 787 cylinders
Units = cylinders of 2016 * 512 bytes
   Device Boot    Start      End   Blocks   Id  System
/dev/hda1             1      305   307408+   b  Win95 FAT32
/dev/hda2   *       306      316    11088   83  Linux native
/dev/hda3           317      367    51408   82  Linux swap
/dev/hda4           368      787   423360   83  Linux native
%
===8<=== CUT ===>8===
They're mounted as /win95 - /boot - (swap) - / respectively - I only
discovered by accident that a FAT32 partition can be mounted as type
VFAT and work reliably for both read and write...and that's in RedHat
Linux 5.2 upgraded to full kernel 2.0.36 as well...
Anyway, under Win95, I can power the machine down and start it up
again, and the network will continue to work after doing so, but under
Linux, I have to take the whole PCMCIA system down and up again to get
it to work, although everything else works fine...
From dmesg I note...

Any advice appreciated...
Best wishes from Riley.
