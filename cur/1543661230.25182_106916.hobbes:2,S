If the system hardware hangs and I can think of at least one reason it 
might do exactly that then all bets are off

Three starting points
1.  Run memtest86 on the box for a bit. I don't think its bad RAM however
2.  Plug in a PS/2 mouse if the box doesn't have one already. That avoids
a hardware flaw on the AMD that we don't current work around in software
3.  Check if 2.4.20 behaves the same way. I think it may fix your short
pauses but I don't think its going to fix the hang alas. It would be
useful to know however
