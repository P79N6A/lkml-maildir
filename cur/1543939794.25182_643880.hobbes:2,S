Subject: [PATCH] x86: fix usage of .section .sched.text in assembler code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/26/223

Without this patch the linker will generate a section
named .sched.text.1 which is unexpected.
This is because the gcc generated section has "ax" but the
assembler usage of .sched.text lacks the "ax" specifier.
It would be better to have a definition we could use from
assembler code but I did not find a suitable header
file for it.

build tested on 64 bit only but seems obviously correct.
