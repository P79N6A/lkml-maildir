So there IS a ChangeLog.  :)

Completely removes the check.

Now we don't check and inform the user anymore, instead we change the
value internally.  So now overly smart users can set the windowBits to
a stupid value and we correct their mistake instead of telling them.
Not my preferred style.

This changes one corner case where windowBits == 9.  Even if the fix
is correct (too lazy to check), it costs us four new conditionals, of
which two were moved into the preprocessor.  And the gain over patch
#4 is zero, since we waste the memory anyway, where windowBits is
too small for decent compression or not.  Rejected.
Still, thanks for the two pointers, Bartlomiej!  Not quite as magic
anymore. :)
