I don't know, but i can reproduce it too. I complained several months ago
about the problem (in 2.6.7/2.6.8 time) but nobody seemed to care :-/.
I think i still got the bad DVD, to try to reproduce the probelm in
2.6.10.

Mine was Rockridge. It seems the contents are not important. The problem
is reproducible with any broken/scratched DVD.
