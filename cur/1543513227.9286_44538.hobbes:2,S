Motherboards without the means to drive FSB and PCI with different
clocks (most older motherboards sold before faster CPUs came out)
simply make PCI clock = 1/2 FSB clock.  If FSB is at 75MHz then PCI is
at 37.5MHz and overclocked.
I haven't heard of motherboards creating PCI clock from FSB with a
modifiable divisor.  Either PCI clock depends on FSB or is driven
separately at 33MHz.
