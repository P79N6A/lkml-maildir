	Are you saying that there do not exist any non-proprietary licenses that
are incompatible with the GPL? That's obviously not true. Consider, for
example, a license that was basically the BSD license with an additional
prohibition against licensing with new restrictions. Consider the original
BSD license with advertising clause. Consider a license that requires the
source to always travel with the binary.
