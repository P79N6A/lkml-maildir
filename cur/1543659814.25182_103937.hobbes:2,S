The vanilla linux kernel doesn't compile for PA-RISC.  This is because, like 
most non-x86 archs, development is done in a source repository stored 
elsewhere and sync'd with the main trunk at appropriate times.
You need the patches from
http://ftp.parisc-linux.org/2.5/kernel-src/
There's also FAQs and Mailing lists appropriate to PA-RISC at
