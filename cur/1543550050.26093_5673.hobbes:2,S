Yes, no doubt because of the fragment of a patch for fs/partitions/check.c:
@@ -181,6 +191,10 @@
                printk(" p%d", (minor & ((1 << hd->minor_shift) - 1)));
        else
                printk(" %s", disk_name(hd, minor, buf));
+       if (hd->major >= COMPAQ_CISS_MAJOR+0 && hd->major <= COMPAQ_CISS_MAJOR+7)
+                printk(" p%d", (minor & ((1 << hd->minor_shift) - 1)));
+        else
+                printk(" %s", disk_name(hd, minor, buf));
 #endif
 }
that someone added for COMPAQ_CISS stuff. As you can see it causes
an additional printk() in the non-COMPAQ_CISS case.
(But this bug has been discussed here already; if it is not fixed
in test9-pre8 or so I'll resubmit the fix.)
