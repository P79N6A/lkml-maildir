This looks wrong. In nonblocking case the "break" exits the loop and
cleanup_rbuf() will be called then anyway. You probably overlooked that
there are 2 cleanup_rbuf() calls, one in the loop and one at the end
of the function.

What is this timeout supposed to do exactly?
Im missing a timeout at the senders side acording to RFC1122/4.2.3.4:
"To avoid a resulting
deadlock, it is necessary to have a timeout to force
transmission of data, overriding the SWS avoidance
algorithm.  In practice, this timeout should seldom
occur."
