Okay, I checked Rubini's book, and he has a solution which seems elegant
enough (Alan suggested it in a previous post, but here's the full
expansion).
Here's the code:
struct wait_queue wait = {current, NULL};
add_wait_queue(&my_q, &wait);
current->state = TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE;
play_with_my_hardware_which_will_eventually_generate_an_interrupt();
schedule();
remove_wait_queue(&my_q, &wait);
my_isr()
{
...
  wake_up_interruptible(&my_q);
...
}
The story is that if the interrupt beats the schedule(), then the task
will be set to state TASK_RUNNING via the wake_up_interruptible call, and
the process removes itself from the wait queue.  This should work well
enough, but I still think that having a bulletproof version of sleep_on is
far more elegant, and may prevent some painful mistakes for driver
writers.
Just one more question (I'm new to linux drivers, was in NT driverland
till recently, glad to get the needle out of my vein :)
In the code above, is there any possibility of the process' state being
changed prior to the schedule() call (i.e. can nonblocking kernel code be
context-switched out?)
thanks,
