Indeed :)
But there is plenty of places in the kernel - sans preemption - where we
sleep while holding a semaphore.  Was that the original question?  If
so, set_cpus_allowed by be one of the few _explicit_ places but we
implicitly sleep holding a semaphore all over.  Heck, we use them for
user-space synchronization.
