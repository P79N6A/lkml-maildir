I think that it is a broken patch and Pete wants you to take
the patch below:
    
http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=120613888005382&w=2
The patch, which Greg and Andrew is taking now, was tested by Chris
Wedgwood and he detected a bug is still in there:
    
http://marc.info/?l=linux-usb&m=120603584207543&w=2
Pete revised it and posted the new patch as above, but the new patch
seems not to be included in the Greg's tree yet.
Pete,
The new patch you posted seems not having your sign-off.
Could you follow it so that the new patch can be included instead of
the old patch?
Thanks,
Kiyoshi Ueda
