Hey there!
Well it needs to be in all kernels regardless, and if it is in the
scsi_request it is transparent to any given personality device and the
caller may reserve the option to include other key information.  Simple
stats of what the queue depth of a given device is and a means to flush
out the commands to force a failure in the case of calling a device reset.
Without being to obvious or rude about the driver model being top down and
not the converse, hunting for given set of operation(s) will almost insure
a driver/device deadlock when racing against the done function.
I am pleased you and I are thinking in the same direction again!
