Alan,
W.R.T the VIA CLE266 DRM merge, do you have any kernel side MPEG2 decoder
bits to add in (along with the V4L part presumably)?  And do you have any
information about the user-space library (libddmpeg.so????) that would be
necessary to go along with?  
I read when you wrote "The CLE266 has some fairly complicated Linux kernel
entanglements to resolve for the hardware mpeg engine stuff,"  but didn't
know how to interpret.
Thanks,
David
