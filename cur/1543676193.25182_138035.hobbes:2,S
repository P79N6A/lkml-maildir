I don't think everyone really wants to see all 63 different
pci_for_each_dev() removal patches and the huge drivers/hotplug/* move
patch on the mailing lists, so I didn't post them here.  But they are
available, along with all of the patches in this series on your
favoriate kernel.org mirror at:
	kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/pci/2.5/*2.5.70*
if people really want to take a look at them.
thanks,
