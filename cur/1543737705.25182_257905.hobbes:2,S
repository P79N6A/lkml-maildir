Sorry ... I must have missed that.

Yes please.

Good.

His fingerprints are all over the revision history.  It looks like the
only real change you want here is deleting the ugly hack for SN2:
< #if defined(CONFIG_IA64_GENERIC) || defined(CONFIG_IA64_SGI_SN2)
< #include <asm/sn/pci/pciio.h>
< /* Ugly hack needed for the virtual channel fix on SN2 */
< extern int snia_pcibr_rrb_alloc(struct pci_dev *pci_dev,
< 				int *count_vchan0, int *count_vchan1);
< #endif
If Christoph signs off on that, then I can feed a separate patch
that does that at the same time as the kill/add.
