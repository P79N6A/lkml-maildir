That's one aspect.
The other aspect of the problem is that when the number of
threads exceeds the number of CPU cores, Linux no longer
manages to keep the CPUs busy and we get a lot of idle time.
On the other hand, with the number of threads being equal to
the number of CPU cores, we are 100% CPU bound...
