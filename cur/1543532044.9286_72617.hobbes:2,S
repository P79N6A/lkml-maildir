Hi,
I'm the guy that asked if anyone had gotten the 440BX (PIIX4)
to use UDMA.  I kept getting DMA timeouts.  I was able to kinda
get it to work...read on.
From what everyone reported back (thanks everyone), there was no
clear pattern.  MAXTORs seem to always work, IBMs too.  To some,
this indicates Seagate and Western Digital are broken.  But, I
haven't heard of problems with these drives when other chipsets
are used.  Maybe I haven't listened hard enough?
Anyway, I got a copy of the 82371AB manual (29056201.pdf, just
search for 82371AB on 
http://www.intel.com/,
 developer section.
It's one of the first datasheets listed.)
There's a table on page 98 which maps the CT values set in regs
4a and 4b to the different modes, and associated UDMA timings.
CT==00, 120ns, mode 0, CT==01, 90 ns, mode 1, CT == 10, 60 ns,
mode 2.
Now, my hdparm -i /dev/hda says:
/dev/hda:
 Model=ST39140A, FwRev=841260, SerialNo=AY073758
 Config={ HardSect NotMFM HdSw>15uSec Fixed DTR>10Mbs }
 RawCHS=16383/16/63, TrkSize=38430, SectSize=610, ECCbytes=4
 BuffType=3(DualPortCache), BuffSize=448kB, MaxMultSect=16, MultSect=16
 DblWordIO=no, maxPIO=2(fast), DMA=yes, maxDMA=2(fast)
 CurCHS=16383/16/63, CurSects=-66060037, LBA=yes
 LBA CHS=1023/256/63 Remapping, LBA=yes, LBAsects=17803440
 tDMA={min:120,rec:120}, DMA modes: mword0 mword1 mword2 
 IORDY=yes, tPIO={min:120,w/IORDY:120}, PIO modes: mode3 mode4 
 UDMA modes: mode0 mode1 *mode2
with tDMA the DMA timings.  So, I thought perhaps, even though
the drive claims to be udma mode 2 capable, maybe the DMA timing
should be 120ns.  So, I forced this into reg4a and reg4b.
The result is: it works.  I am able to use UDMA for the first
time ever.  hdparm -t (and dd ...) times are about 13.5 MB/s,
about what you would expect.  System time is kinda high.
I've included my notes on lspci -xxxbs 00:04.1.  The following
does not show 4a and 4b == 0.
Thoughts?  comments?  Maybe tDMA as reported by hdparm isn't
even related to the mode values and my drive just doesn't work at
mode2 like it should?  I'm very new to the wonderful world of IDE.
All tests were run on 2.2.15pre14, with the latest ide patch.
To force reg4a and 4b, all I did was edit piix.c, writing:
(line 339)
	if (speed >= XFER_UDMA_0) {
		if (!(reg48 & u_flag))
			pci_write_config_word(dev, 0x48, reg48|u_flag);
/*
		if (!(reg4a & u_speed)) {
			pci_write_config_word(dev, 0x4a, reg4a & ~a_speed);
			pci_write_config_word(dev, 0x4a, reg4a|u_speed);
		}
*/
		reg4a = 0;
		printk( "PIIX4: Forcing 0x4a-0x4b to 0x%4.4x.\n", reg4a );
		pci_write_config_word(dev, 0x4a, reg4a);
		if (speed > XFER_UDMA_2) {
			if (!(reg54 & v_flag)) {
....
This is not a patch because this is not a fix...also, I got the
same results on 2.3.99pre2.

	Well, maybe.  What is tDMA as reported by hdparm?  How
	does it relate to setting up the PIIX4?
