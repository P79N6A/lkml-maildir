Please read this sentence over and over until it sinks:
"If the Program specifies a version number of this License which
applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation."
Pay most attention to this part "If the Program specifies xxx and "any
later version"", especially word "specifies".
