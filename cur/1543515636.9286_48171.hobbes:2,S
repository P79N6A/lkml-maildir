After trying kernels 2.3.22, 2.3.23 and 2.3.26 i finally got my system to
come all the way up by forcing fsck to check my drives serially...
Before this I was getting signal 10 (operational error, reboot) on
/dev/hda7. However, if i went into single user mode and fsck -f'd it, it
was fine, no errors.  So i was wondering if anyone else had had this
problem, if it was a known issues, if it's some weird special case, etc...
i realize that fdisk complains about partition 1 nore ending on a cylinder
boundry, however, the drive is 14 gigs, and i assume that fdisk is simply
confused... it's worked perfectly under 2.2.x and now seems to be fine
under 2.3.26 after i do non-parrallel fsck... obviously, being hda, it's
an IDE drive... it's an IBM 14GXP 14gb 7200 rpm drive.
I also included the info on my second drive (/home) just in case someone
felt it might have an impact. It's one huge paritition, but nothing seems
to complain about it.
info follows:

ps. does anyone know if there are known issues with USB mice being
"unresponsive" in 2.3.x? My mouse seems sluggish, doesn't pick up clicks
as nicely as the ps/2, etc... any info would be appreciated, and any
pointers would be helpful...
also, does anyone know the equivalent for this under 2.3.x?:
ioaddr = pcidev->base_address[0];
i looked around for a while, and all i could find that seems to make any
sense is something like:
ioaddr = pcidev->resource[0].start;
but this is not working, and i haven't taken the time to really look at a
lot of this, and wondered if someone here might be able to give me the
quick fix... this code is from the sblive driver (emu10k1)... i got it to
build, but I get "Device or resource busy"... i'm assuming that's because
i'm ending up w/ the wrong base address... otherwise, i think i might be
semi-close to having it working... but then again, i'm not too familiar w/
drivers, so i could be way off-base...
thanks in advance...
