maybe really nobody has this seen but here when 2.2.13 is ran in SMP, it
crashes when doing a shutdown; the UP version is OK.
I have heard a similar report from someone who overclocked his machine in
the same range of speed I have (466 MHz) but he contributed it to the
overclocking.
anyone else or are there tips to investigate further ?
it stops directly after 
INIT : switching to runlevel 6
INIT : sending processes the TERM signal
