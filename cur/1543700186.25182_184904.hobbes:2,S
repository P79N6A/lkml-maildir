Tues evening it hardlocked - no messages, no blinking keyboard lights,
nothing.  Yesterday it did it again, and this time it wouldn't get more
than 5-10 minutes of uptime without hanging no matter what I did to
memory/cpu timings.  (Even underclocked it to 133 and 1G with no
change.)  So its unfortunately back on a stock 2.4.23-pre9 with
noapic/noacpi. (It disables one of the sets of usb ports, as I recall,
but it mostly works...)
In theory I'll have the ram upgrades and such tonight, so I can swap the
services to another machine and stress it a bit with different sticks,
new drives, different controller, etc.  Other than memtest86 (and some
kernel builds, bonnie, etc), are there any recommended tests?
