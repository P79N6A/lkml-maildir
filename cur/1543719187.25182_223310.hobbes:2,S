Subject: Can't make XFS work with 2.6.6

Hello,
I'm having a problem getting my system to boot with 2.6.6 and a XFS root 
filesystem. On boot it can't mount the root fs:
XFS: Bad magic number
XFS: SB validate failed
Kernel Panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
XFS is compiled in so it's not a module problem. Google says this error is 
usually caused by passing the wrong root parameter to the kernel, but I'm 
definitely giving the right root device.
I can boot just fine with 2.4.25 using exactly the same boot options in Grub.
I attach my .config. I'd be very greatful for any help with this. I've tried 
recompiling with XFS as a module and checked my version of xfsprogs meets the 
requirements.
Thanks in advance,
David.
