One question that puzzles me... cache for disk files and cache for
program data will have very unlike characteristics. Executable program
storage is typically more constant. Often disk files are read once and
throw away and program data is often reused. This isn't always true,
but it is very common.
My puzzle is how the MM system should balance between those three uses
of cache. Under pressure. it is very easy for disk file cache to
overwhelm program data and executable storage. And equally program
data can overwhelm disk file cache storage.
If there is more than enough memory, no problem. When there is not
enough, what algorithm is used to achieve an effective balance of
usage?
Thanks,
John Alvord
