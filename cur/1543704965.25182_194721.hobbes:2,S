A simple framebuffer connected to the parallel port would be trivial
to make, and it would be suprisingly useful for simple applications
such as word processing.  Literally a handful of components soldered
on to a piece of stripboard and well written drivers for the
framebuffer console and X is all it would take.  No need for anything
remotely fancy at first.
