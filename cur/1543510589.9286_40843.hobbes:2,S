Please undo this patch.
It is wrong for at least three reasons.
First of all, it is superfluous. If someone needs different
key assignments he should use loadkeys, not change the kernel.
Secondly, this file should correspond to defkeymap.map, as the
first two lines say:
/* Do not edit this file! It was automatically generated by   */
/*    loadkeys --mktable defkeymap.map > defkeymap.c          */
Thirdly, c-cedilla is not the same symbol as c-acute.
The former is used in French and has Unicode value U+00c7 and U+00e7
(capital and lower case), the latter is used in Polish and has
Unicode value U+0106 and U+0107. It is very strange to have
acute accent combined with C produce a symbol different from C-acute.
