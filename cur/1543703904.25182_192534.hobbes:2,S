To pour confusion on this, I thought this was working already. I just
(Sunday) tried burning audio CDs with the ide-cd interface, using
Joerg's new a25 version of cdrecord which claimed to use DMA for 2352
byte audio sectors. Worked! About 92% idle and 5% wait-io. only 1%
system while burning at 32x. And the CD does play just fine, I listened
to it all the way to work.
Is this a physical/logical sector thing, or is Joerg doing a magic
trick, or what? Definitely does work in terms of producing correct
output, is it really writing 2352 byte secotrs?
