Retransmits within a few 100 microsecond should no longer be occurring.
Have you redone those measurements with a more recent kernel?
2.6.x and 2.4.x should have pretty much the same code for RTO
estimation.
In fact pretty much all the 2.4.x and 2.6.x RPC code is shared. The one
difference is that 2.6.x uses zero copy writes.

Or changing the default value of "retrans" to something more sane. As
usual, Linux has a default that is lower than on any other platform.
