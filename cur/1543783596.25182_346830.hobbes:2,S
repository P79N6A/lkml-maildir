If you shrink existing partitions it won't ever screw you up. The
geometry data for the partition table spans only the non HPA area.

But they are also on the IBM I looked at are obvious because the
geometry in the partition table does not span the HPA so the problem
doesn't arise as confusion.

Many of those "magic windows drive/bios fixup" type programs work by
having the jumper on the drive set the HPA and the drive report a
smaller size, then the windows magic driver undoes this.

I fear not.

fdisk and friends already have to parse and process the existing
partition tables.

Define "not for consumption". It should be *hard* to use it, and it
should not occur by accident. Deliberately is a different matter. And
that should be a run time not boot time action.

Known problem. ACPI provides the correct infrastructure for much of this
but the IDE layer doesn't support it. Send patches to Bartlomiej. The
core infrastructure is there because Andre saw the need for the ACPI
taskfile support coming. The HPA restore is just another step in the
state machine for resume and quite doable. Good little project for
someone wanting to play with the IDE layer.

Assuming we are talking about hda1/2/... then the partitions are already
clipped by the OS to the volume size. We could conceivably make the size
of the disk itself writable. We don't need to get into programming drive
HPA when we can do it ourselves, and we can clip non HPA capable drives
too should someone find a cause for it.
