This is all a non-issue. The page structure just represents little more
than a physical address to the block layer in the context of merging,
so the pfn_to_page(page_to_pfn(...) + ...) bits calculate this properly.
There is just nothing interesting going on here. Generate the page
structure for the piece of the segment, kmap_atomic() it, and it's done.
