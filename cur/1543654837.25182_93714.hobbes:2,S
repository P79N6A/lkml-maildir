If you need a certain page reserved at boot-time you are out-of-luck.
You can tell the kernel (using mem=xxx on the boot command line) that
you have somewhat less memory than you do and then you can write a
module that accesses the other memory that the kernel doesn't use.
If you just want to make sure that your module owns a particular
page that nobody else uses, just use ioremap() in your module to
allocate a particular address. Those page(s) are now owned by
your module and will never be paged. You can access those pages
from user-space by providing some connectivity in your module
(like read()/write()/ioctl()).
