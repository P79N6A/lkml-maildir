Thanks. I'll update the broken commits.
Btw, the funny thing is that, looking at my shell history, I think I
actually did the right thing when committing your patches:
git commit -s --author 'Remy Bohmer <linux@bohmer.net>'
git commit -s --author 'Chip Coldwell <coldwell@frank.harvard.edu>'
But for some reason only your names stuck, not your e-mail addresses...
