Hi!
I got spitz machine today. I thought oz3.5.3 for spitz would be
2.6-based, but found out that I'm not _that_ fortunate.
What's the status of spitz? I see log from 2.6.12-rc boot, and pages
at 
http://www.orca.cx/zaurus/
 seem to be old...
Is there simple way to tell spitz and tosa apart (like without opening
the machine)?
Aha, I realized that spitz support came into 2.6.14-rc2, so something
definitely _is_ happening. Are there newer patches than orca.cx
somewhere?
