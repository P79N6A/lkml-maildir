           Summary: No ataraid support in 2.5.65?
    Kernel Version: 2.5.65
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: alan@lxorguk.ukuu.org.uk
         Submitter: zhen@gentoo.org
Distribution: Gentoo 1.4_rc3
Hardware Environment: AMD Athlon XP 1900+
Software Environment: gcc 3.2.2/ GLIBC 2.3.2
Problem Description:
This may not actually be a problem, but I have not seen anything in the kernel
config or the source itself for ataraid under x86. I have checked the mailing
lists, but there is no pertinent information there. I am using a HighPoint 370
PCI RAID controller. Either I am missing this, or the support is just not there.
Any information?
Steps to reproduce: Look for ataraid support in the kernel config. It is not
there. A `grep -irn ataraid *` in the kernel source tree returns ataraid only in
non-x86 architectures.
