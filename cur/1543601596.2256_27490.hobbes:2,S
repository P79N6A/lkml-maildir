Because it lets anyone crash the machine by feeding a Voodoo1 garbage. To
get something like that into the kernel I suspect would involve
-	Making sure glide is using the fifo
-	Writing a parser for packet1-packet5 commands to verify they 
	are valid
then voodoo would be safe for user direct access.
