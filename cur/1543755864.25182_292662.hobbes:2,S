As a temporary workaround, dropping the lock should also work:

An other serial interrupt can not disturbed, because it will be blocked by the interrupt lock.
All other direct access to the UART seems to be protected by the port lock, so they may be only
execectued, while tty_flip_buffer_push is running and is not accessing the port.
I have this patch running on a 2.6.10 Kernel (Fedora Core 2 Version) and low latency mode
works without any problems (with and without SMP).
If that patch works under all conditons, I can't say. It may cause degrade the performance,
but for my work, I can't see any effect.
