No, thats definitely not the problem either.  I have 96Mb of RAM
in my system - 64Mb of which is cached and 32Mb uncached.

Actually, my system runs *faster* with 64Mb of RAM than it does
with 96Mb.  The 32Mb of uncached RAM slows things down
noticeably, but that happens regardless of the kernel I use, or
OS for that matter.  The slowdowns are definitely not memory
related.
Thanks for the idea though.
