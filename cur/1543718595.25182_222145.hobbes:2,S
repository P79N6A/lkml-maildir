Hi,
Just wanted to inquire about something curious that I saw in the kernel 
subtree...
Currently modprobe_path and hotplug_path are declared as "char ...[256]", 
though it seems to me (unless I've missed something), that they only ever 
hold "/sbin/modprobe" and "/sbin/hotplug", respectively. Any reason why we 
couldn't simply declare them "char ...[]", and let them be sized 
appropriately?
Let me know if I've missed something.
Thanks,
Vadim Lobanov
