note that this workaround doesn't seem to work in all cases.
Mine may a slightly different model (I have the tablet version)
but disabling hpet shows the same regression.
I've been fighting Eric's USB debug cable code in the hope
of getting _something_ useful out of it other than a black screen,
but I've been getting nowhere with it.
