Agreed. :)

Will change to:

I don't know if anybody ever really requires this data, but the device
I'm talking to records the extremes in hardware, so I put it in the driver.

Guilty as charged.  Since ibmpex is the only on-board power meter hardware
to which I have access, the interface proposal includes the various odd
pieces that the hardware provides in addition to the meters.  I
could take the historical extreme and reset bits out of the proposal and
put them in something like Documentation/hwmon/ibmpex.txt as extra
chip-specific features if people prefer that.

The ibmpex hardware only knows how to reset all of them.

I'd prefer to leave it explicitly called out as a separate sysfs knob,
unless there are established precedents for resetting a sensor by
writing something to its sysfs file.
