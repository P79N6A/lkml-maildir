Subject: [PATCH] Fix kernel lockup in RTL-8169 gigabit ethernet driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi everyone,
This is a tiny patch that fixes a particularly annoying bug
in the Realtek 8169 gigabit ethernet driver.  Due to a logic error,
there is a loop in an interrupt handler that often goes infinite, thus
locking up the entire computer.  The attached patch fixes the problem.
I have patched against linux-2.6.5-rc2-bk6, however the source file in
question hasn't been modified for a long time, so the patch should apply
cleanly to any recent kernel version.
Cheers,
Adam.
