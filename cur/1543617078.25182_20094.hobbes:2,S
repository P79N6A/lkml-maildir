 *sigh*, and the package updater to get a new kernel for $distro
 is insufficient because ?
 distro kernel update has the following advantages.
 - Comes complete with the 200 patches already applied.
 - Is _tested_ by $distrovendor.
 - If it screws up, and Aunt Tillie shelled out for support
   (which of course, she did being the 'needing support' type)
   $distrovendor will help. Ringing support and saying "Melvin
   told me to install a new kernel, and now my box doesn't boot"
   may not be a supportable scenario for all vendors.

 Red Hat & Mandrake are not the only distros with online update,
 in fact, it's probably considered a must-have feature for most
 distros these days.

 Wait a minute. Not ready for 'apt-get', but ready to build & run a
 kernel made up of a collection of random patches on Melvin's say-so ?

 Various distro vendors update facilities give you this option.

 Some even autodetect.

 Indeed. It's called YaST, Red Carpet, Mandrake Update, apt-get,
 apt-rpm, and a plethora of other such tools.

 Yup. One where reinventing the wheel seems appropriate.

 The systems are designed, and the punchline is, that they work,
 and they're being used out there today.
