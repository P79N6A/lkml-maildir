Subject: [PATCH] remove throttle_vm_writeout()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This in preparation for the writable mmap patches for fuse.  I know it
conflicts with
  writeback-remove-unnecessary-wait-in-throttle_vm_writeout.patch
but if this function is to be removed, it doesn't make much sense to
fix it first ;)

From: Miklos Szeredi <mszeredi@suse.cz>
By relying on the global diry limits, this can cause a deadlock when
devices are stacked.
If the stacking is done through a fuse filesystem, the __GFP_FS,
__GFP_IO tests won't help: the process doing the allocation doesn't
have any special flag.
So why exactly does this function exist?
Direct reclaim does not _increase_ the number of dirty pages in the
system, so rate limiting it seems somewhat pointless.
There are two cases:
1) File backed pages -> file
  dirty + writeback count remains constant
2) Anonymous pages -> swap
  writeback count increases, dirty balancing will hold back file
  writeback in favor of swap
So the real question is: does case 2 need rate limiting, or is it OK
to let the device queue fill with swap pages as fast as possible?
