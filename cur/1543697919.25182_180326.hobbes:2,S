Heinz has written a target for 2.4, see:
people.sistina.com/~thornber/pending-patches/2.6-unstable/multipath
I've been looking at this and changing it a bit as it moves to 2.6.
We've provided an abstraction for a 'path selector' object, so people
can plug in their own selection policies (as discussed in Ottawa).
Currently there is a priority based round-robin selector, a latency
selector (dubious IMO) and I want to do a simple 'throughput
optimiser' selector.
Keep an eye on my unstable 2.6 tree which can be found via:
people.sistina.com/~thornber/
Currently this tree has experimental targets for:
snapshots
mirroring (just enough for pvmove ATM)
multipath
flakey (simple test target I'm using for multipath dev)
The LVM tools are at the design phase wrt. multipath.
