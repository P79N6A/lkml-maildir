It used to be that way a couple years back. Now it supports
read/select/nonblocking read, etc. You can also query the joystick
configuration (number of buttons and of axes), etc. And if you want
more, you can use the input event interface, which is generic for all
devices in the system, and get even more information from that.
But there is one (and I think a good one) rule for the kernel input
drivers: Never mangle the input data from the device. Interpret it, put
it into a simple event format and pass it to applications. Don't
generate synthetic events, don't invent new buttons which don't exist on
the device, etc, etc. So far this rule helped to keep the drivers sane.

Autofire? I haven't seen it in any at least remotely recent device.

That's what I (the person in charge of care for the joystick drivers in
the kernel), think too - the autofire feature is better in some lib
(thinking SDL and the likes), or in apps directly.
