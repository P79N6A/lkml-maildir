Depends on the app - for the networking stack, I agree.
To revisit Ben's comment: if we know something is likely to be misaligned,
a RISC processor can efficiently load both parts and merge them (one cycle
penalty vs a regular aligned load). Given misaligned accesses are infrequent
enough to affect performance, it makes sense to do this in SW because
it reduces cost of the HW design/test/mfg cycles.

Ok. If the kernel networking stack used get_unaligned() in the one place
Peter originally found, x86/sparc64?/et al wouldn't see a difference.
It would avoid traps on ia64 and parisc.  Bad idea?
Any other arches it might help/hurt on?
