Don't - not all raidlevels/architectures will work with this combination.
2.2.14 can be cleanly patched using 
 
http://www.redhat.com/~mingo/raid-2.2.14-B1
For 2.3.x, there's a patch as well:
  
http://www.redhat.com/~mingo/ibc-ext2-raid-2.3.40-N1
Be warned that this patch changes some rather fundamental stuff and that
you should be carefull testing it - see Ingos announcement for the patch in
mailing-list archives.
Bye, Martin
