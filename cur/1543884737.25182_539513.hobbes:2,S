The changes to the keymap files and so forth aren't quite as simple 
though. Have to convert the latin1 characters within character-constant 
expressions to \0 notation, while the comments can be left as utf8.

Does this mean you're doing it and I'll be ignored, or that few people 
care and I'll be ignored? I figure if I just repost my patches to LKML 
once per month, they'll eventually get merged (or at least I'll get 
comments on how people actually want them). Things are tough on a 
high-volume list. I think the git method may have the best chance of 
success. We'll see.
