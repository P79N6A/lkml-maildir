Oh, ok. I just haven't understood the NFSv4 up/down calls, then. There's
a userspace daemon listening for requests to map ID's and such? Does it
map usernames to uid'ss or uid's to uid's? Does it require the usernames
to be the same on the client and the server?

That makes sense. I'll have to take a look at the nfs code before I do
anything else, though.
