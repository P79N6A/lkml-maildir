Slight tangent, FWIW...   Back when I was working on my "race-free 
userland" project, I noticed that the fastest cp(1) implementation was 
GNU's:  read/write from a single, statically allocated, page-aligned 4K 
buffer.  I experimented with various buffer sizes, mmap-based copies, 
and even with sendfile(2) where both arguments were files. 
read(2)/write(2) of a single 4K buffer was always the fastest.
