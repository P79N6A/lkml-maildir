"I Love Lucy" was a 1950s sitcom on television, one of the first and
very good indeed.
In the episode referred to, Lucy and her friend Ethel get hired as
candy-packers in a candy factory. The candies come by on a conveyer
belt and the girls put them in boxes. Everything went smoothly... the
manager reviewed the situation, and congratulated them. Then they
increased the conveyer belt flow. After a few more cycles, the candy
was coming too fast. So they started taking the candies, stuffing them
into pockets, blouses, mouths... and the scene ends with the manager
arriving back madder then heck.
