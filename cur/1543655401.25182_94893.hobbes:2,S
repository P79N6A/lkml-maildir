I see: The code used in v2.4.10 of the kernel reads like this:
            if (txc->modes & ADJ_FREQUENCY) {   /* p. 22 */
                if (txc->freq > MAXFREQ || txc->freq < -MAXFREQ) {
                    result = -EINVAL;
                    goto leave;
                }
                time_freq = txc->freq - pps_freq;
            }
The PPSkit code reads like this:
                if (txc->modes & MOD_FREQUENCY) {       /* p. 22 */
                        long freq;              /* frequency ns/s) */
                        freq = txc->freq / SCALE_PPM;
                        if (freq > MAXFREQ) {
                                result = -EINVAL;
                                freq = MAXFREQ;
                        } else if (freq < -MAXFREQ) {
                                result = -EINVAL;
                                freq = -MAXFREQ;
                        }
                        L_LINT(time_freq, freq);
#ifdef CONFIG_NTP_PPS
                        pps.freq = time_freq;
#endif
(So just limit the argument in addition to returning -EINVAL; the other 
differences are because of the modified clock model and nanoseconds)
Returning "-EINVAL" is a subject to discussion, so it could be left out.
I don't have the time to make a proper patch at the moment, but I think 
everyone could fix it until a proper patch is available.
