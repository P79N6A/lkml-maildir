Unfortunately, with 2.6.13-rc4 the problems are still here.
It takes, on average, about 5-6 reboots before I get a working
keyboard.
It's a problem I can live with.  Once things get going, the
system runs without any problems for the rest of the day.
If there is anything I can do to assist, just let me know.
