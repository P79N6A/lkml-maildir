Hi Jens,
I got 2.5 booting on ppc64 today and noticed that the behaviour of 
sglists has changed. Before we would get an array of sg->address,
sg->length pairs, we now get sg->page, sg->offset, sg->length triplets
(from blk_rq_map_sg).
I dont care too much either way, but if this change is here to stay I'll
let the non intel maintainers know so they can fix up their pci dma
code.
Anton
