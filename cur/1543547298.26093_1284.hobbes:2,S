I'm seeing a problem between Linux 2.2 and BSD/OS 4.1 in the situation on one 
of our backbones.
We have a number of Linux hosts on this backbone with a primary address in
the network a.b.c.0/24 and a secondary address in the network d.e.f.0/24.
We also have some BSD/OS 4.1 machines in this network with addresses in
d.e.f.0/24 only.
Now when the Linux box a.b.c.1 (with secondary address d.e.f.1) wants to
talk to the BSD/OS system d.e.f.2 it does
    a.b.c.1 arp who-has d.e.f.2
Which d.e.f.2 promptly ignores, presumably because the IP stack in BSD/OS
throws it away at a low level, or possibly simply because BSD/OS has no
idea where to send the ARP response.
The end result is that a.b.c.1 can't talk to d.e.f.2 because it does an ARP
from the wrong IP address and doesn't get a response.
Is this already fixed in 2.4 or it is something which needs investigation
and a patch?
According to the standards, who is in the wrong?  To me it looks like Linux
is the misbehaved OS in this case.
David.
