Could you explain this more in depth?
What you describe looks like you propose to add a line:
joerg::::defaultpriv=file_dac_read,sys_devices,proc_lock_memory,proc_priocntl,net_privaddr
to /etc/user_attr which would be honored by PAM during login.
This is not what I like to see.
What I like to see is that only specific programs like cdrecord
would get the permissions to do more than joe user.
