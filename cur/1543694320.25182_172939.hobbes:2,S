I think it is correct, though arguably it should be "MAY_EXEC" rather
than "S_IXOTH" (both of which are '1').
The permission call checks if the current user (which is computed from
the rpc credentials) has eXecute access to the directories.

Have you actually tried this or are you just assuming?

Presumably you got lots of "nfsd_acceptable failed at ....".  Is that
correct? 
I guess I need to do some testing with "subtree_check" set and see if
I can reproduce it.
