	Hello,
	I've just upgraded to 2.3.43 (well in fact, to 2.3.44-pre8) and discover
that the kernel won't compile, it complains about undefined reference
scsi_init_malloc(); it seems that this function has been deprecated and 
now kmalloc should be used instead. I'm currently compiling it after 
changing that.
	I would like to know if there are any plans to include lm_sensors 
on the main kernel, I've been using it for a long time and it sem quite 
stable, and it even include an automatic kernel patch generator (in perl) 
so it should be trivial to include it and as it is just an add-on I think 
it won't change anything that is currently working.
	Thanks
	- german
