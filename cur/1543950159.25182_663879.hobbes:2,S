Ah... I wasn't really Nacking your patch specifically.  I was trying to
say "this scheme isn't gonna work".  Your patch does make good sense
given the situation (and I think I did acknowledge that above).  Sorry
about the miscommunication.

Yeap, completely agreed.  That one gets my big Nack-You-Idiot.

I don't really care about scsi_bufflen() and I'm not willing to change
any of that.  If SCSI LLDs are happy with scsi_bufflen() != sum(sg), no
problem at all.  What I'm against is pushing that into block layer,
which until now had "true" size == rq->data_len == sum(sg).
We're about to break one of the two equals if we're gonna do sg
manipulation in block layer (Jens seems to be planning something
different) and all I'm saying is we're far better off breaking the
former one.
First, I don't really think SCSI LLDs will make much use of explicit
padding or draining.  Secondly, even when such need arises, keeping
scsi_bufflen() at the "true" size is easy no matter which way we go with
rq->data_len.
Anyways, let's wait and see what Jens comes up with.

Yeap, given the current code, I agree.
Thanks.
