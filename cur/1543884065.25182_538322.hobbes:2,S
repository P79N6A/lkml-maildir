vmallocspace allocations are always separated by at least a page, so
this establishes guard pages both above and below the stack by virtue
of such.
It's also notable that the option establishes guard pages for IRQ stacks
in like fashion.
It's a shame that the resource scalability implications of vmallocspace
allocations prevent this from being useful in production. One could, in
principle, establish guard pages within ZONE_NORMAL, but for 4KB stacks
it's somewhat awkward to dredge up 3 contigous pages, and 4 defeats the
purpose. Alignment with 8KB stacks wants 2 contiguous order 1 pages that
span an order 2 page boundary. I guess I could rewrite the page allocator
(again), but people seem to feel safest with the buddy allocator affairs.
BTW, did the original patches for this prove to be of any use to you?
