Don't like it. First, it sounds like overkill. Second it's got some
interesting security implications - only root should be able to flood
the kernel message queue, but non-root should be able to syslog, even
from early userspace. Third, if the only user is klibc, then it's
working against the early userspace's concept of simplifying the kernel.
Why not simply create a file on the initramfs, open it append, spool
raw user and kernel messages to it, then copy that file into the real
syslogd's socket when it becomes available? The "hard" part of syslogd
is the filtering, copying raw messages from socket to file is easy..
