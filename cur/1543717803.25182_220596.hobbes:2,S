I have applied this to my netdev-2.6 tree, and so it should show up in 
-mm sometime.

Even though it is quite moldy, I want to give people some time to object 
before I remove it upstream.
BTW, I plan to remove rcpci driver at the suggestion of Pete Popov, as

days" driver, and nobody really has the hardware from this defunct 
company anymore, apparently.
