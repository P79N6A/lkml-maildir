It seems like I would zonelist_node_idx() for this, along the lines of:
	static nodemask_t *nodemask_thisnode(nodemask_t *nodemask,
		struct zonelist *zonelist)
	{
		int nid = zonelist_node_idx(zonelist);
		/* Build a nodemask for just this node */
		nodes_clear(*nodemask);
		node_set(nid, *nodemask);
		return nodemask;
	}
But I think I need to check that zonelist->_zonerefs->zone is !NULL, given this
definition of zonelist_node_idx()
	static inline int zonelist_node_idx(struct zoneref *zoneref)
	{
	#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
		/* zone_to_nid not available in this context */
		return zoneref->zone->node;
	#else
		return 0;
	#endif /* CONFIG_NUMA */
	}
and this comment in __alloc_pages_internal():
	....
	z = zonelist->_zonerefs;  /* the list of zones suitable for gfp_mask */
	if (unlikely(!z->zone)) {
		/*
		 * Happens if we have an empty zonelist as a result of
		 * GFP_THISNODE being used on a memoryless node
		 */
		return NULL;
	}
	...
It seems like zoneref->zone may be NULL in zonelist_node_idx()? Maybe
someone else should look into resolving this :)
Thanks,
Nish
