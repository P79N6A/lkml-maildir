When booting 2.3.18 I get...

hdb: INVALID GEOMETRY: 0 PHYSICAL HEADS?
hda: cdrom_pc_intr: The drive appears confused (ireason = 0x 1)

I'll leave it to the IDE and CDROM people to find out what
precisely causes the difference between 2.2.5 and 2.3.18.
But clearly, already 2.2.5 was buggy.
I suppose I know what causes the bug in 2.2.5, namely our
old enemy probe_cmos_for_drives().
This has always been a strange, buggy routine, but long ago
it bit fewer people, because not so many people had both IDE
and SCSI on one machine.
Please try to disable probe_cmos_for_drives()
(by replacing the #ifdef __i386__ at the start by #if 0).
and report on whether 2.2.5 and 2.3.18 show improvement.
