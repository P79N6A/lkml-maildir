So, I can conclude that as I am not seeing any OOM messages in dmesg, 
that the OOM is not responsible for my kills. Even without syslog set 
up, I should see the OOM in dmesg shouldn't I?
So, I have a mystery reason why X getting killed.
Can anyone else suggest any other possible causes for unexpected X 
getting killed?
