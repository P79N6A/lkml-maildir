The explicit alignment would be my preferred way to fix slab debugging
on s390. We still have the problem that practically all s390 device drivers
need 64-bit alignment on slab allocations.
Our current hack is to redefine BYTES_PER_WORD in slab.c to 8, but what
I'd like to see is a per-architecture alignment in kmem_cache_init
that would default to 8 on s390 and to sizeof(long) otherwise.
Using the current SLAB_MUST_HWCACHE_ALIGN is not an option since
it wastes a lot of memory with our 2048-bit L1 cache lines.
I'd also like to avoid creating special slab caches for anything
that needs 8-byte alignment.
