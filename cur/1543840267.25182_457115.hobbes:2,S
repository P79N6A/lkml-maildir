What I also forgot to mention is, that it's a SmartMedia Flash Card I have  
here, which is told to always identify as a IDE device.

Ohh, that's why lsusb never worked.. but you won't like the current result:
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 046a:002b Cherry GmbH  -->  Keyboard
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 0451:2046 Texas Instruments, Inc. TUSB2046 Hub
Bus 001 Device 001: ID 0000:0000  -->  What the..?
But I'm afraid I broke my SMC, while playing around with my disassembled  
T20, since GRUB hangs with 'GRUB _' without having changed anything in the  
software. D'oh!
That's why I can't test with 'USB Mass Storage' support in the kernel at  
the moment, which would probably uncover the mysterious '0000:0000' USB  
device. Gonna try again next week with a new SMC.
Cheers, milahu
