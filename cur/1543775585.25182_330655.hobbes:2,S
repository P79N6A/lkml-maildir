That is what usually happens. But the sbp2 related diffs between 2.6.13 
and linux1394 are not an update by linux1394 but rather a rewrite by the 
scsi folk. Unfortunately, that rewrite was not tested by the linux1394 
team. (And was therefore not checked in at svn.linux1394.org. Lack of 
manpower was one factor.) So, applying the sbp2 portion of your diff is 
a back-out, not an update.
I have a question: Do you need _both_ the sbp2 back-out and ieee1394's 
disable_irm parameter, or only one of them?
