Well the things is not having the PCI id is the same things as
commenting out Load "dri" in the xorg.conf really, X never tries to
initialise the DRM layer on the card, I know this is a bug in the
current 7.0 radeon driver and I'm hoping Ben's fixed can fix this
however, we will end up never being able to turn on DRM support for
r300 cards until X.org 7.1 is widespread or we add some kind of second
stage enable that a new X server can work but I'm not really sure that
this is possible,
The fix is to not load DRI on old X.org r300 installs...
Dave.
