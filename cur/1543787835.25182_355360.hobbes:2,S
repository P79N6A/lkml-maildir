Usually yes but it makes releasing partial initialization much simpler
because you can  reuse the normal release counterpart. For example,
static int driver_init(void)
{
     dev->resource1 = request_region(...);
     if (!dev->resource1)
             goto failed;
     dev->resource2 = request_region(...);
     if (!dev->resource2)
             goto failed;
     return 0;
failed:
     driver_release(dev);
     return -1;
}
static void driver_release(struct device * dev)
{
     release_resource(dev->resource1);
     release_resource(dev->resource2);
     kfree(dev);
}
Many drivers have the release function copy-pasted to init with lots
of goto labels exactly because release_region, iounmap, and friends
aren't NULL safe.
