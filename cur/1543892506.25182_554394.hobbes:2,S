Thanks for forwarding the message.  Unforunately it's a false alarm.  
As mentioned in the original patch, the test it uses isn't precise.
To tell you the truth, I rather think there's not much point in keeping
usb-try-to-debug-bug-8561.patch around.  Anything seriously wrong that
it could catch ought to have shown up long ago.  And it is now clear
that bug 8561 has nothing to do with this; it is a programming error
common to many of the USB serial drivers.  (Still waiting to hear back 
from Paulo Pereira whether the fix to the USB Option driver works...)
My vote goes toward reverting usb-try-to-debug-bug-8561.patch.  
However just to be thorough, for anyone wants to keep it here's an
untested patch to remove those false alarms.
