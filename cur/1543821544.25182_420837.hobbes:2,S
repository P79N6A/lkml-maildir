All I can say is that some of our guys tuning a big application on a
customer's site reported seeing the VMA lookups being on the profile
list.  This was some huge Java program.  It might be that every other
page had a different protection, executable or not, read-only mmap etc.
 And data access for very non-local.
I cannot say more since this was near to the end of the trials.
