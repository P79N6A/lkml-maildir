Huh ? If they are not memory barriers, they how can you guranttee
ordering on weakly ordered CPUs ?

Given that there is no smp_mb__after_clear_bit() after clearing
work->pending, what prevents the worker thread from seeing
the state of the deferred fd queue before setting the pending bit ?
IOW, the queuer sees pending = 1 and ignores waking the
worker thread, worker sees a stale state of the deferred fd queue
ignoring the newly queued work. That should be possible on
a cpu with weak memory ordering. Perhaps, we should fix
__queue_work() to add the smp_mb__after_clear_bit() and
make sure that we have a memory barrier after adding the
deferred fds.
