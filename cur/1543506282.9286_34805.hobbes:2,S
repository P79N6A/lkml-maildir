Exactly. 
Think of the user address space as the "window" that you get to look at
things - rather than being the things that drives IO, it's the thing that
allows the user to _look_ at IO while it is being driven.
So what a driver should do is to just allocate pages all over the place by
physical address (ie using __get_free_page() or similar), and then add
those pages to the IO window (the intel magic hardware translation thing)
and the user window (so that the user can see and change the pages that
are being used for IO).
