I reported this yesterday - 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/11/22/137
 - It
is commit 700f9672c9a61c12334651a94d17ec04620e1976 that breaks the
build.
Linus: I think that commit should either be reverted or fixed in a
different way before 2.6.19. As it is right now we have a build
failure :
net/built-in.o: In function `irlmp_slsap_inuse':
net/irda/irlmp.c:1681: undefined reference to `spin_lock_irqsave_nested'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
