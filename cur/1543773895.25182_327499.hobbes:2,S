I could throw the same sarcasm back at you.  We must be doomed because
Reiser does some stuff that VFS already does!  Or am I misunderstanding
the complaint?

How does it get proven if you won't give it a chance as a *separate*
unproven mess, with a big fat EXPERIMENTAL flag, for users to play with?
I know, it exists as a separate patch.  But it works now, and I think
the best way to "prove" it would be to package it with the kernel.
