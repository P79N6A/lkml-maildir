I think you misunderstood Jeff. I would also not be happy if I suddenly saw 
a bitkeeper advertisement during kernel bootup, which is what is quoted above.
It is not a piece of the kernel so it shouldn't be advertised as such. It 
is a tool that is used in combination with the kernel and the docs for such 
tool are rightfully in the kernel. docs != advertising. How many people 
will read the docs? Not many. And certainly not many who would be 
purchasing bitkeeper. How many people will see the above show copyright 
messages on boot? A LOT. Anyone booting Linux in fact...
Best regards,
Anton
