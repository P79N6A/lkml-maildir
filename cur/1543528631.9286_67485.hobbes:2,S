Hi,
>Is there a linux port of ka9q ?
interesting question. Ist there anything ka9q can do that
Linux Router cannot? The Linux equivalent for the ka9q command
interpreter is the shell, obviously.
One difference between ka9q and Linux is that the commands are
built into ka9q while they are external programs in Linux.
Perhaps someone will find it useful to create a new shell with
all these commands built in.
