use the perl GET command ...
	GET 
http://www.site.org/index.html
 | less
or use a shell (which is there for a reason)
	diff <(GET 
http://sometime.org
) <(GET 
http://sometime.com
)
a large problem with hiding this functionality inside open() is
that the URL is not the only attribute being sent in the HTTP/1.1
GET request.  also, what interface would you provide for PUT and
POST?
