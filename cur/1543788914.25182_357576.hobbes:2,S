[PATCH] gfp flags annotations - part 1
 - added typedef unsigned int __nocast gfp_t;
 - replaced __nocast uses for gfp flags with gfp_t - it gives exactly
   the same warnings as far as sparse is concerned, doesn't change
   generated code (from gcc point of view we replaced unsigned int with
   typedef) and documents what's going on far better.
