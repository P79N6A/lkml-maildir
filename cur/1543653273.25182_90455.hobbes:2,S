Michael,
As was mentioned by another poster, UP IOAPIC is very likely the problem 
suspect here, but ACPI is also a possibility.
Booting with "noapic" or changing your BIOS to "MP 1.1" instead of "MP 
1.4" will likely solve the problem.
If that doesn't not solve the problem, try disabling ACPI in your 
kernel's config.
Please let us know if either of these solutions works for you!
thanks and regards,
	Jeff
