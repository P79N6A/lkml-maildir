Ok. I guess we need to have a __register_mmu_notifier that expects the 
mmap_sem to be held then?

No you cannot do that because there are still callbacks that come later. 
The invalidate_all may lead to invalidate_range() doing nothing for this 
mm. The ops notifier and the freeing of the structure has to wait until 
release().

That does not sync with the current scheme of the invalidate_range() 
hooks. We would have to do a global invalidate early and then place the 
other invalidate_range hooks in such a way that none is called in later in 
process exit handling.
