Hi,
OMG what do I have to do to post here? 10th attempt.
{part2}
Here is a non-exhaustive list of typical devices types requiring fat vfat
support:
fd ide-hd scsi-hd usb-hd cdrom usb-hd usb-handheld (iPod, iRiver etc)
usb-flash (usbsticks, cameras, some music devices.)
IIRC the sync mount option for vfat is ignored for file systems >2G, this
effectively (and probably intentionally) excludes nearly all hd partitions
and iPod type devices.
sync does not have any meaning for CD DVD media.
