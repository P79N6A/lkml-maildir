Although not it is possibly not directly related to your problem, 
I've also experienced soft lockups on CPU#0 with a Dell PE1850 running
Xen unstable and 2.6.16. The BUG caused the machine to instantly 
crash and was 100% reproducible by starting an ftp transfer from
a fast server.
After spending a good portion of the day pulling my hair out, I 
figured out that the USB controller in Dell PowerEdges is really 
flaky and had caused similar problems before. Disabling the USB 
controller from BIOS made my problem go away.
