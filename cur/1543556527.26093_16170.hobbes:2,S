Hi Linus,
It is quite clear that dropping and retaking the files_lock in
fs/file_table.c:get_empty_filp() at the label new_one is absolutely
unnecessary. The only reason one could think of was to "hold the lock for
as short time as possible" but a minute's thought reveals that such reason
is invalid (i.e. one is more likely to waste time spinning on the lock
than to save it by dropping/retaking it, given the relative duration of
the instructions we execute there without the lock).
So, the patch (tested under 2.4.0-test12-pre5) is below.
Regards,
Tigran
