        Justin, thanks for this! I've tried 2.4.20-pre1 with your
.config (and then with my .config), and it works!
        Further investigation showed that the problem first appeared
somewhere between 2.4.20-pre2 (works for me) and 2.4.20-pre5 (has the
lock-up problem I've described). I was not able to test -pre3 and -pre4,
because these kernel died on me during boot after the
"Initializing RT netlink socket" message.
	I the bug got merged from the -ac kernels, because it is
present bot in the kernel 2.4.19-11 from RedHat "null" beta
and in 2.4.20-pre2-ac1 (altough the later crashes instead of lock-up).

	with 2GB it still fails. I didn't try less, because with 1GB of RAM
it would not have any effect.
: I assume removing read+lseek eliminates lockup?
	Partly. I've tried 
dd if=/dev/hda3 of=/dev/null bs=1024k, and it still causes filesystem
corruption (altough no lockup).
: Is it IDE related or not? 
: If you can test it over SCSI/NFS/ramdisk/???...
	I think it is IDE or DMA related.

	-d1 -X33 fails.
-Y.
