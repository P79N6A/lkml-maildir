Subject: [PATCH] Fix budget-ci linking problem

Hi, a user reported that had linking problems when compiling the kernel.
After looking at his problem I found out that there was missing the
compilation of stv0297.c when budget-ci.c was selected. So I made this
simple patch that solved the user's problem.
The downstream bug report is this one:

If you need anything more from me, just mail me.
