There aren't any mature IDEs from Linux (apart from Emacs, which is
hardly user-friendly). Such things run counter to the Unix philosophy
of achieving complex goals through the use of a combination of simple 
tools that perform a single task well.
There are some excellent graphical debuggers though - DDD is my 
favourite:
