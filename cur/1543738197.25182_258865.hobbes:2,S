Sounds like you've chosen powersave as the default power governor in 
your config. Change it to performance or modify it manually in
/sys/devices.... cpufreq/scaling_governor
(cant remember the exact position; you'll find it)
cat the output of that file and see if it says powersave performance or 
ondemand. You can manually change it from one to the other, or set 
either powersave or performance in your config during kernel config.
Cheers,
