	Or a more generic 'notifier' facility by which the kernel
	could issue more than one kind of command:
	o  "save state of everything into memory for latter resurrection"
	    [for saving system state to disk, and restoring it from there]
	o  "disable everything" [for the average shutdown/halt/reboot use,
	    "but don't mess the saved state!"]
	o  "resurrect from saved state"
	The driver of the save device must not be disabled before it is
	safe thing to do, and it may need some more radical approach to
	restart too.

  PCI-cards must be disabled individually -- especially those that can do
  BUS-master cycles.
