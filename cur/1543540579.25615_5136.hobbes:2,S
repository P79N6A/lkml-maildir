Yes, I'll second this.  I get requests for DTR/DSR (and DTR/CD) hardware
flow control in Kermit all the time for this kind of reason.  The equipment
involved is not "legacy" (my least favorite word -- in common parlance it
means "not Microsoft") at all, just weird.
There are standard APIs in SVR4 for all sorts of hardware flow control,
specified in <termiox.h> (or <sys/termiox.h>):
ioctl(fd,command,arg)
struct termiox * arg;
The termiox struct contains a member:
unsigned short x_hflag; /* hardware flow control modes */
Which can be set to various combinations of:
#define RTSXOFF 0000001 /* Enable RTS hwfc on input */
#define CTSXON  0000002 /* Enable CTS hwfc on output */
#define DTRXOFF 0000004 /* Enable DTR hwfc on input */
#define CDXON   0000010 /* Enable CD hwfc on output */
#define ISXOFF  0000020 /* Enable RTS hwfc on input */
to achieve unidirectional or bidirectional hardware flow control.  The last
one is used only for synchronous operation (via clock pulse signals).
ioctl() commands are:
TCGETX  - get termiox params into arg.
TCSETX  - set termiox params from arg immediately.
TCSETXW - ditto, but waits til after output queue is finished.
TCSETXF - like TCSETXW but also discards all chars queued for input.
I'll be glad to supply greater detail from the SVID if needed.
