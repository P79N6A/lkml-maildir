Hi,
I've written an usb driver for linux for a specific usb host
controler. Basicaly the hw generates an interrupt every 1 ms (every
start of frame) and during transfers interrupts can be generated every
30 us ! My cpu is a MIPS one running at 96Mhz and HZ is 100.
After transfering 20M bytes of data through USB, the kernel loops for
a while in timer interrupt handler. It actually loops in update_times
with tick (jiffies - wall_jiffies) value equals to 3707637046 ! I
guess that the kernel have lost a lot of timer ticks...However
interrupts are enable inside usb driver, I don't see how the kernel
can lost so many ticks.
Could anyone give me some advices for that ?
Thanks
