Hit the same problem back in the 2.5 kbuild days, and worked around it
with some dummy dependency rules.  Like this one for bison/yacc.
side_effect(aicasm_gram.tab.h aicasm_gram.tab.c)
which expands to
$(objtree)/aicasm_gram.tab.h: $objtree/aicasm_gram.tab.c
	@/bin/true
That forces make to wait until aicasm_gram.tab.c is built before using
aicasm_gram.tab.h, and allows the following code to depend on either
aicasm_gram.tab.h or aicasm_gram.tab.c without any races.  The command
should not get executed, but you still need a command to keep make
happy.
