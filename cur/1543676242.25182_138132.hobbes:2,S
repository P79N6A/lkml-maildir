The first entry (devices/pci2/....) is wrong imho.
With multiple domains, we can have several busses with the same bus number,
one in each domain. So it's a matter of taking the current set of pciN
entries and moving them below a "pci-domain" entry (or hose, or whatever
Linus prefers).
Also, the node name for individual PCI devices must include the domain
number, the current bus:dev.fn notation isn't enough, that will break
things like /sys/bus/pci/devices when you have several identical bus/devfn
pairs on different domains
