Versions of GCC exist for most major DSP architectures (apart from the low
end ones). The code isn't exactly production useful, but for a number of
prototyping activities doing a first pass of at least the non-critical parts
of the DSP code in C has RAD value.
What's all the garbage about RTL? Of course an RTL description of any DSP is
possible. An RTL description of any clocked digital system is possible. How
the hell do you think the silicon guys design the darned things?
