I think I got something, icmp_error_track() increases the use count
(calling ip_conntrack_find_get()) when it returns with no error (not NULL). 
Whoever calls icmp_error_track() and gets a valid pointer to ip_conntrack, 
must call ip_conntrack_put() - look at ip_conntrack_in(), line 685, the
pointer is just used in a boolean expression without calling
ip_conntrack_put(). I'm not sure if other places needed fixing, but anyway
try this patch:
