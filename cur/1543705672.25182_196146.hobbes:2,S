Honestly, I like the way this currently works.  You tried to do
something not allowed, and the kernel dies.  Now it would be nice to be
able to provide a better type of error message to help the unsuspecting
developer out, but that's just fluff :)

Why not just fix the sysfs create_dir() function to not oops and report
back the proper error message in this case?
