I tried that tree but got this error from a powerpc ppc64_defconfig build
(which is 64 bit):
fs/xfs/linux-2.6/xfs_file.c:365: error: 'xfs_file_compat_invis_ioctl' undeclared here (not in a function)
Eric mentioned that your patch "had a problem of its own", so I assumed
that was it and left it removed from today's linux-next.
