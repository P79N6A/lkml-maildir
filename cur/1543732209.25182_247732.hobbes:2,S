well... external modules thus should be really really careful with
ioctls then and not embrace and extend too much but just use existing
ones instead when reasonable

such is life

adding ioctls SHOULD be painful. Really painful. It's similar to adding
syscalls; you'll have to keep compatibility basically forever so adding
should not be an easy thing.
