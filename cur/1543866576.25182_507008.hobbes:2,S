Well yes, there are incidents.  We have too many coders and not enough
reviewers, testers and bug-fixers.
If I had two solid days to sit down and carefully review, test,
try-to-exploit and if necessary improve/fix this code then perhaps we'd get
there.  But I'm nowhere vaguely near being able to afford that time and
things are just sitting there.
I have an email sitting in my drafts folder stating that I'll no longer
accept any features unless they've been publically reviewed in detail and
run-time tested by a third party.  The idea being to force people to spend
more time reviewing and testing each other's stuff and less time writing
new stuff.  Maybe on a sufficiently gloomy day I'll actually send it.
