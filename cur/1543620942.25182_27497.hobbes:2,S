   If you're really interested in the outcome, please examine the lkml
   archives.
The conclusion we came to is that there is no reason you can't do the
remapping from interrupts on ARM and propagate the GFP_ATOMIC
properly as well.  Right?
Or is this another "I'm not going to make the change until it
is required of me" situation?  If so I'll just make it so :-)
