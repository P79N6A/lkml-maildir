by default the main kernel is compressed, why should the modules not be 
compressed by default as well?

this varies a lot on the particulars of the data being compressed. I don't 
know what difference it makes on the kernel modules, but I have seen it be 
worth it in some other cases.
however, I do need to ask what the sizes of the resulting files end up 
being (on my system the last kernel that used modules was 2.4.31, so I 
can't just look this up myself). in most cases disks are formatted with 4K 
blocks, so unless it shrinks across such a boundry it's not actually going 
to help much.
one other thing to consider would be some ability to load the module out 
of a tar or cpio bundle, that way you end up saving all the partial blocks 
from each module as well.
