I'm an experienced C programmer with no knowledge of the Linux kernel. I
was wondering if anyone is writing drivers for DSL cards, and if not,
could someone give me some pointers?
I purchased the book 'Linux Device Drivers' (O'Reilly), but it covers
developing drivers for the 2.0.X series, and I'd rather write for 2.2 or
2.4. If someone could point towards some good documentation, it would be
really appreciated.
Thanks, and please CC any responses.
