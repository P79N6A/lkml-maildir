Hmmm. Debian 2.0 here, glibc 2.0 (later upgraded to 2.1).
modutils 2.1.121 wouldn't compile with the included header
files. I made asm and linux symlinks into the (2.2) source
tree and everything's happy. Since then I've compiled
lesstif, pgcc, GNOME, GIMP, and a host of smaller programs;
no problems.
If we're supposed to leave those directories alone, what
about the kernel structures which differ between 2.0 and
2.2?
Now I'm confused....
