Hello,
I have a Contemporary Controls PCI20 card and am trying to use the latest
arcnet drivers under Mandrake 8.0 with a 2.4.4 kernel.  
I do the following:
insmod arcnet
insmod arc-rawmode
insmod com20020
which all load just fine.  However, when I do:
insmod com20020-pci
I get the following errors:
init_module: No such device
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters,
including invalid IO or IRQ parameters
In syslog I get:
May 17 09:39:08 collector kernel: arcnet: COM20020 PCI support
May 17 09:39:08 collector kernel: PCI: Found IRQ 10 for device 00:04.0
/proc/pci reports the following for the PCI20:
Bus  0, device   5, function  0:
   Network controller: Contemporary Controls CCSI PCI20-CXB ARCnet (rev
1).
     IRQ 10.
     Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0x41000000 [0x4100007f].
     I/O at 0x2080 [0x20ff].
     I/O at 0x2400 [0x240f].
/proc/ioports reports for the PCI20:
2080-20ff : Contemporary Controls CCSI PCI20-CXB ARCnet
2400-240f : Contemporary Controls CCSI PCI20-CXB ARCnet
  2400-2408 : arcnet (COM20020)
/proc/interrupts registers nothing for 10 (but I assume this is normal because
the driver never correctly loads?)
I would appreciate any help in getting this module loaded.   There are no  irq
conflicts for IRQ 10, and I tried putting the card in different slots and on
other IRQs to no avail.
Thanks,
Mike
