Depending on the type of SATA you use, the hard disk may be called either /dev/sda or /dev/hda
libata emulates SCSI, so it will be called /dev/sda
Find out which partition is /
Eg: /dev/sda2
Then append root=/dev/sda2 to the kernel boot prompt.
If you are using grub, press "e" for "edit".
All that will work given that you have built the proper IDE or SCSI drivers into the kernel.
Also, make sure you have built the proper filesystem support into the kernel too.
