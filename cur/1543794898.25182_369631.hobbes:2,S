on a reasonably new CPU you ought to be able to set the 64-bit value - 
but that doesnt change the fundamental fact: we have no idea how much 
time has passed while we were in HLT. Especially with things like 
dyntick/noidle we could spend _alot_ of time in HLT, and the TSC could 
drift significantly. How do we know how much that is?
