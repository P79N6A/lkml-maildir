Wow! I have found the following in ide-cd.c
	devinfo->de = devfs_register(drive->de, "cd", DEVFS_FL_DEFAULT,
				     HWIF(drive)->major, minor,
				     S_IFBLK | S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO,
				     ide_fops, NULL);
So in fact we are devfs_registering the ide-cd rom driver *twice*.
The proper resolution will most propably be to remove this info
there and to use this only in ide.c.
