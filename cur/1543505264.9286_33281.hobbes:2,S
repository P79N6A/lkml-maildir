bootsect.S could definitely be dropped, but I personally suspect it
would be a mistake to drop the setup.  Otherwise the dependencies
between boot loader and kernel would be a lot more painful.

Well, except for the fact that booting is so incredibly different on
different architectures...
It would probably be quite a bit easier with the "lbcon" boot loader I'm
currently working on, if only because it runs in a 32-bit environment
and most of it is C code, compiled with gcc.  That doesn't mean that
there needs to be code that is substantially different between the
various architectures.
The main reason I'm writing lbcon is because I think it will make doing
fancy stuff with initrd a lot less painful, and it should be easy to put
a nice user interface on it.  That's the theory, at least...
