You're not even safe over standard output, simply run the program over
ssh and you suddenly have socket semantics to deal with.
In the early days the fun game to play was to run programs over rsh to
see in what amusing way they would explode.  ssh has replaced rsh in
this game, but the bugs have largely stayed the same.
Even early versions of tar used to explode on TCP half-closes and
whatnot.
In short, if you don't handle short writes, you're writing a program
for something other than unix.
We're not changing write() to interlock with other parallel callers or
messing with the f_pos semantics in such cases, that's stupid, please
cope, kthx.
