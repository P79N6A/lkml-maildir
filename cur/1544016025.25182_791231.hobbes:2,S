After rtc compile fix, the kernel boots.
But with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM, I saw BUG_ON() at 
fork() -> ...
	-> copy_page_range() ...
		-> copy_one_pte()
			->page_dup_rmap()
				-> __page_check_anon_rmap().
BUG_ON(page->index != linear_page_index(vma, address)); 
fires. (from above, the page is ANON.)
It seems page->index == 0x7FFFFFFE here and the page seems to be
the highest address of stack.
This is caused by
 fs-execc-fix-value-of-vma-vm_pgoff-for-the-stack-vma-of-32-bit-processes.patch 
This is a fix.

pgoff is *not* vma->vm_start >> PAGE_SHIFT.
And no adjustment is necessary (when it maps the same start
before/after adjust vma.)
