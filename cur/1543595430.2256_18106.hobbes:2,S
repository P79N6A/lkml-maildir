Subject: freeing pagetables in vmfree_area_pages in vmalloc.c

we have in vfree -->
vmfree_area_pages (calling) free_area_pmd (calling) free_area_pte (calling)
free_page.
The final free_page frees all the pages that are allocated to a memory region in
vmalloc.
Now where are we freeing pages that are allocated to page table themselves.
For simplicity we can assume 2 level page tables (pgd == pmd)
