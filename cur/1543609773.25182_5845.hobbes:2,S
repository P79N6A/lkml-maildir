Well, I haven't done any temperature monitoring yet, but the case is a
monstrous Hudson rackmount chassis, with tons of space and several extra
fans, so I imagine that overheating is unlikely.
It may be hopelessly subjective, but the exhaust air from the back feels
cooler than on most of our other machines - but I know it's the CPUs
that count most.
Taking out one CPU may be an option; I'll try some other kernel options
first....
Cheers
