Hacks that work well may get to stay until such a time as a clean fix
can replace them. But this is not even a working hack and is broken at a
conceptual level. It can do no better than guess at what's a text file and
what's not and there are common cases where it will be wrong. Moreover,
it's not orthogonal. It's not specific to file systems, it's specific to
files.
The proper way to deal with such files is well understood. Be strict in
what you send and be lenient in what you receive. It's a user space
problem. Changing the appearance of files on disk is as insane as
transparently changing data in a TCP flow.
