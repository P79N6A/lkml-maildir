They have, but they keep it pretty well hidden. Version 4.50 of the
ServeRAID driver seems to support kernel 2.4 and can be downloaded
from 
ftp://ftp.pc.ibm.com/pub/pccbbs/pc_servers/24p2809.tgz
There is also driver disk that lets you install Red Hat 7.0 on a
ServeRAID array which can be found at
ftp://ftp.pc.ibm.com/pub/pccbbs/pc_servers/24p2811.exe
This too was hard to find on the IBM web sites, and there is no
mention of it at all on the Red Hat web site.
While you're at it, you might just as well download
ftp://ftp.pc.ibm.com/pub/pccbbs/pc_servers/24p2817.iso
 and burn it on
a CD. This is a bootable (windows) CD that contains the above files
plus everything else  you need to get your ServeRAID running with
Linux or other operating systems.
