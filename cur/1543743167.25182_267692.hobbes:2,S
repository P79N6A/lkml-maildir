Aaah. OK - I see what you mean. Not sure I agree, but at least I understand
now ;-) will think on that some more, but I'm still not sure it makes any
difference.

Not really, I just don't want to waste hot pages on DMA that we could
be using for something else.

Mmmm. probably depends on cache size vs readahead windows, etc. I'm don't
think either of us has any numbers, so we're both postulating ;-)

Why is it tons of memory? Shouldn't be more that cache-size * nr_cpus,
and as long as we fetch from the cold to the hot, it's not really wasted
at all, it's just sitting in the cache. I guess we don't steal from other
cpu's caches (maybe we ought to when we're under very heavy pressure),
but still ... I think it's a marginal amount of memory, not "tons" ;-)
