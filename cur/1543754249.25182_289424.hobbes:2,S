this particular test was done with an UP kernel. (although the
testsystem indeed is an SMP box.) Generally i mention SMP explicitly. 
There are a couple of patches in the -RT tree to make RT scheduling
better on SMP systems.
with those fixes applied (i.e. under the -RT kernel), jackd/jack_test
behaves better than on a single CPU. I didnt find any scheduling anomaly
that wasnt caused by the kernel.
