Please forgive my ignorance Ingo but ...
I suffer from race condition blindness. A terible afflicition when one is 
trying to understand the sublties of the kernel, but I'm trying.
While I am not questioning your suggestion, I have thought about the code 
and fail to see the race you point out. Please help me along.

Do you mean we don't want to sleep under the spin lock?
Would a GFP_ATOMIC make a difference to the analysis?

As I said please give me a hint about your thinking here.
And the use of a memory barrier as well ... umm?
