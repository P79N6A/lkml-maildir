right, but are the CKRM people ready to take this on?  for instance,
I just grepped 'throttle' in kernel/mm and found a per-task RM in 
page-writeback.c.  it even has a vaguely class-oriented logic, since
it exempts RT tasks.  if CKRM can become a way to make this stuff 
cleaner and more effective (again, for normal tasks), then great.
but bolting on a big new different, intrusive mechanism that slows
down all normal jobs by 3% just so someone can run 10K mostly-idle
guests on a giant Power box, well, that's gross.

if CKRM is just extensions, I think it should be an external patch.
if it provides a path towards unifying the many disparate RM mechanisms
already in the kernel, great!

but the Linux RM needs to subsume traditional Unix process groups,
and inherited nice/schd class, and even CAP_ stuff.  I think CKRM
could start to do this, since classes are very general.
but merely adding a new, incompatible feature is just Not A Good Idea.
