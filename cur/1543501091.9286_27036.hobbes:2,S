Linux Folks,
We have posted a new release (nwfs-1.4.3).  This releases fixed bugs in the
name mangling code, symbolic links, compile problems with Stock Linux, and
the salvageable file system.  We will be posting a second release this week
after we have flushed out any remaining bugs in the hard link, symbolic
link, and device file code.  The Unix namespace now stores Unix style
permissions and converts correctly between NetWare attributes.  There was a
problem with the DOS name space getting trashed on 3.x volumes for certain
names because of the name mangling code (vrepair would run and fix the
names), this problem has been fixed.
We have also fixed the nasty compile problems on Stock Kernel 2.0.37.  You
will note in the code that we have the conditional compiles in the 2.2 and
2.3 Linux.  We are dovetailing these code changes in and they should be
available for testing and release early next week.  We have done a first
pass 2.2 version, but not completely debugged.  We will attempt to have one
up for 2.2 late this week or early next.
NWVOL will be releaesed this Friday for enumerating volumes.  Please refer
to release notes for info on what has changed.
This code can be found via ftp at 207.109.151.240.
