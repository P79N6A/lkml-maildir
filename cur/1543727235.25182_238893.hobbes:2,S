The only thing I can see in there which needs lock_kernel() is the access
to core_pattern - it's changed by sysctl, which also takes lock_kernel().
Probably, adding a lock_kernel() and a comment around the call to
format_corename() should suffice.  Please make format_corename() static
while you're there.
