I can't test that, so safe answer is to refuse to arm the oopser.
Since LBA is most common, that's my first priority.

Me too 8(.  The oopser is allowed to (a) refuse to arm at arming time,
or (b) refuse to dump at dumping time, but it'd be nice if it worked
on the widest range of stuff possible (ie. CHS and LBA48 at least).
Of course, it can't use any external routines, and must be small too.
The IDE layer does a great job (on my hardware) from recovering after
we rudely steal the device from it, but no doubt the oopser could be
nicer about it.
Thanks for reading,
Rusty.
