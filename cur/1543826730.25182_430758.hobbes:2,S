Thanks for your kind reply.
I did the following experiment.
I create my own cache with kmem_cache_create() and specify the
constructor to be init_once()-- a simple constructor like NFS does.
I checked the cache parameter and find that each slab has 1 page and
can hold 10 objects.
Then, I used kmem_cache_alloc() to allocate 128 objects. So it should
occupy 12 full slabs and 1 partial slab. Right?
But when I walk through the slabs_full and slabs_partial list, I found
that slabs_full returned 13 slabs but slabs_partial returned 0.
That's why I am confused. I am using 2.6.16 BTW.
Any further insight?
Thanks,
Xin
