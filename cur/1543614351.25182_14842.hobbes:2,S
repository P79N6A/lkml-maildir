One thing which worries me is that the number of
these machines is very small, so the code could
temporarily go the way the SGI visws code went.
It would be nice if this code was split out in
such a way that it won't have any impact on the
maintainability of the mainstream code, so even
if the voyager folks go on holiday, normal Linux
development can continue and the resulting bitrot
will be limited to just the voyager code.
cheers,
Rik
