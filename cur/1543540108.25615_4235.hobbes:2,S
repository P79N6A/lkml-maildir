It is NT that made these into permission bits.
NT lets you chown() a file to yourself (only to yourself) if the
file's ACL grants you this right. Nobody can chown() a file to
somebody else, but any file owner can grant the "take ownership"
right to somebody else. People with WRITE_ACL can grant themselves
this right too.
WRITE_ACL sure isn't UNIX-like. Neither is DELETE, which lets you
bypass directory write permission to delete a specified file.
NT has both of these.

The withdrawn POSIX draft only has rwx permissions. I have draft 17.
