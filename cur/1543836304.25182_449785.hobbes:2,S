Actually, if you compiled with debugging information on, you can use gdb
to get a pretty good location:
$ cd path/to/build/directory
$ gdb vmlinux
GNU gdb 6.3

GDB is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are
welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions.
Type "show copying" to see the conditions.

This GDB was configured as "--host=i386-linux --target=x86_64-linux".
(gdb) li *0xffffffff80271e93
That is if your gdb is also compiled for 64 bit.
