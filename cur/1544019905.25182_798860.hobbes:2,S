Thanks Eric,
Moving the position into the seq_file structure is much cleaner.  Basic 
tests seem to work ok.
Few comments:
- seq_open needs its fmode opened up to take advantage of this [patch 
below]
- There's still the inherent problem of reads peturbing other reads (both 
read and pread).  Our applications should be ok with this, however it does 
deviate from the supposedly thread-safe pread semantics.
