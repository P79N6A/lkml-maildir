Consolidation of the efi support across architectures needs to be done 
at some point and this will be a bigger task. But right now my focus is 
x86_64.

I'm not sure what you mean by VGA compatibility mode. There is no

All right. I will double-check into the older kernel.

To the extent I have tested, the feature works. Should this still be 'n'?

Not sure if this becomes obsolete with e820 change. I will look into it

This wrapper code was tested and added to elilo with x86_64 support. 
There are some efi calls with > 6 args as used in elilo. So, the wrapper 
code is more elaborate to deal with those cases. Although the efi calls 
used here in the kernel do not exceed 6 args, for the sake of 
generality, the same code is being used here. So, is there a better way 
to handle more number of arguments? I tested with the LIN2WINxx macros 
from ndiswrapper code ( 
http://ndiswrapper.sourceforge.net/joomla/
) and 
that works. The LIN2WINxx defines macros to call with a specified set of 
arguments. For instance, an efi runtime call with one argument should be 
called with LIN2WIN1() and so on. If this approach is acceptable for 
inclusion, that is a possible candidate for replacement.
I had an issue with the code snippet you provided for an efi call with 5 
args to get efi variables. I didn't investigate this further.

This code is called during early boot. This should be __init. Ditto for 
i386 version. It too does not have __init.

I don't think so. For instance, when efi_get_time is called later, the 
virtual mode is set up and it does not
cause the physical mode call.

I don't have a suspend/resume hang. The issue I documented was with 
regard to the behavior of the desktop with just one of the git kernels 
prior to 2.6.21 release. I tested the suspend/resume with the patch 
applied to 2.6.21. I tested by directly writing the state to 
/sys/power/state. However, powersave -U did not seem to do anything. 
This seems to me a user-mode utility issue rather than the kernel support.

efi init code sets up efi.get_time to a virtual mode function that can 
be called later. So, I don't think there is an issue here. Correct me if 
I'm wrong.

Agreed. However, the function is declared extern in include/linux/efi.h. 
So, it can not be both static and inline. Ditto for the i386 code too.

Ok, I will fix this. Ditto for i386/efi code.

I've finally a version that is working with standard page table setup 
code. By the way, I got rid of the duplicate code. Also, I have 
integrated EFI memory map into e820 space.

I integrated the EFI memory map into e820 and it takes care of printing 
that. So, print_efi_memmap() can be gotten rid of.

Probably not needed. This is lifted from i386 efi init code.
