But that wouldn't really help ... all objects have lifetimes.  What
Tejun is pointing out is that we have two different lifetime
requirements:  driver internal (and subsystem) objects and sysfs
objects ... we still need something embedded in the driver objects, so
it may as well be struct device ... trying to manage struct device
outside of the driver objects would turn into another nasty refcounting
problem.  The struct device is usually the generic abstraction of the
specific structure it's embedded in, so I think it really does make
sense to keep these pieces together.
