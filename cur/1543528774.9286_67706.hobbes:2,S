 Vojtech Pavlik added because of USB ACM;
 Al Longyear added because it may be a PPP bug]

The USB driver doesn't do anything with skbs -- the PPP driver does all
that.  So the PPP driver should be changed to do kfree_skb_any(), right?

Vojtech/Al care to  comment?  What should be changed:  USB ACM driver to
call PPP from bh context or PPP to accept calls from irq context?
Either way, this part of the tty interface is not well documented.
