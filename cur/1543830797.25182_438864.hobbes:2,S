There is actually no such word in the dictionaries I have access to
(including the OED). An -ing form would be "-lling" in British English

This was discussed at length about three years ago and the lling was the
decision taken at the end of the thread.

Persistantly is also correct. Both forms are valid English

levelling with double ll is also correct English. Single "l" is an
Americanism. Please stop trying to "Americanise" the Kconfig files and
just fix actual errors.
