You may try to append 'snd-virmidi=1,1' (first 1 means enable and second 
index starting with 0, so virmidi will be the second card in your system).

It's not a priority for us. I ported this code from OSS driver at some 
time, but I probably did some mistake.

We don't have user space tools to update DSP code although our emu10k1
driver is capable to do it. Sure, we are doing things differently than OSS
driver so you cannot simply use the OSS utilities.
Perhaps, time to help us?
