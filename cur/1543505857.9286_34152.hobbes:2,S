According the the single unix spec
 Each process is controlled by an associated scheduling policy and
     priority. Associated with each policy is a priority range. Each
     policy definition specifies the minimum priority range for that
     policy. The priority ranges for each policy may overlap the
     priority ranges of other policies.
