This patch makes each futex waiter hold a reference to the mm or inode
that a futex is keyed on.
This is very important, because otherwise a malicious or erroneous
program can use FUTEX_FD to create futexes on mms or inodes which are
recycled, and steal wakeups from other, unrelated programs.
It isn't entirely trivial, because we can't call mmdrop() or iput()
while holding the spinlock, I think.  (Does someone know to the
contrary?)  Rusty, you will be glad to see that I have reimplemented
futex_requeue() exactly as you suggest: in two passes.
Ulrich will be glad to hear tst-cond2 runs just fine :)
Linus, please apply unless there are objections.
Thanks,
-- Jamie
