If only. In my limited experience SanDisk cards have been the most 
tolerant. I suspect that Sandisk actually implement the full range of 
timings documented in the spec, and nobody else bothers.
This isn't normally a problem on PC hardware, but if you try to 
implement an interface to talk to a CF card in an embedded system you 
find this out.
