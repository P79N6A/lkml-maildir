Friends,
Where could I find some tips and tricks for correctly doing socket programming
from a kernel module and a kernel thread.
I am totally stuck and not able to proceed.
I am invariably getting kernel panic from __skb_dequeue inline function called
from alloc_skb.
In detail I posted following mail, but unfortunately it could not attract
anyones attention.
Sub : alloc_skb panic oops / virtual network interface

Hope to get some response and much need guidance from linux gurus.
thanks in advance,
regards
