The amount of memory isn't quite "insignificant" (three 640x480x2
buffers), but the OLPC people clearly need things to work this way.
There are, as far as I know, no other systems out there using the CAFE
controller.  Making things work by default for the one user (with a fair
number of deployed systems!) makes sense to me.  So...

That said, I do prefer the original name for the parameter.
