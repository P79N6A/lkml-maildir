Actually, this has nothing at all to do with exit(). 
The same thing comes up when you want to do an execve() (yes, I know 
pthreads doesn't support a thread starting another process, but the fact 
that pthreads is broken is no excuse for broken interfaces).
If the parent needs to be notified that the stack slot is no longer in 
use, it needs to happen for execve() too, not just exit().
In fact, I'd say that this thing is tied in to "mm_release()", not
"exit()".
The fact that the child doesn't want to send a signal to the parent on 
exit is a totally different matter, and should already be supported by 
just giving a zero signal number.
