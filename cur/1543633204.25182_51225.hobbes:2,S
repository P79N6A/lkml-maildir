But what would you _do_ with them? What would be the advantage as compared
to the current situation?
Now, to configure a device, you get a fd to the device the same way you
get a fd _anyway_ - with "socket()".
And anybody who says that "socket()" is utterly unnatural to the UNIX way
is quite far out to lunch. It may be unnatural to the Plan-9 way of
"everything is a namespace", but that was never the UNIX way. The UNIX way
is "everything is a file descriptor or a process", but that was never
about namespaces.
Yes, some old-timers could argue that original UNIX didn't have sockets,
and that the BSD interface is ugly and an abomination and that it _should_
have been a namespace thing, but that argument falls flat on its face when
you realize that the "pipe()" system call _was_ in original UNIX, and has
all the same issues.
Don't get hung up about names.
