	Hi Jeff,
	Here are a bunch of patches to push to 2.5.X alongside the
patches from Martin. As you can see, many trivial fixes to the core,
and some more driver work. I'm quite pleased that VIA contributed a
driver for their hardware.
	Patches tested on 2.5.74, been a few weeks on my web page
without anybody complaining.
	Thanks in advance...
	Jean
