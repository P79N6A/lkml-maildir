Subject: [PATCH rc5-mm1 1/3] mm-have-zonelist: fix memcg ooms
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Memcgroups up against their limit were OOMing unjustifiably on x86_32
with highmem: pages ripe for freeing were not being found.
It's because the zonelist changes in vmscan.c now derive zone from gfp_mask,
and the gfp mask being passed into try_to_free_mem_cgroup_pages is atuned
to allocating a struct page_cgroup (__GFP_HIGHMEM masked off), whereas here
we need to be scanning highmem zones.
Frankenstein a gfp_mask from GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE and the mask passed in.

Same error was in -rc3-mm1, sorry for not sending fix in time for -rc5-mm1.
The error comes 1 or 4 patches earlier, but this patch atop 2.6.25-rc5-mm1
fits best just after
mm-have-zonelist-contains-structs-with-both-a-zone-pointer-and-zone_idx.patch
I've other GFP masking fixes or cleanups to come another day: this fixes
just one clear bug, peculiar to the -mm tree, orthogonal to the rest.
But two little do_try_to_free_pages cleanups follow on from this...
