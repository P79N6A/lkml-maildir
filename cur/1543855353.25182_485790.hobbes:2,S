Not at all.  It creates even more problems for me, with this circular
dependency:
  linux/bitops.h -> asm-arm/bitops.h -> asm-arm/system.h
   -> linux/irqflags.h -> linux/kernel.h -> linux/bitops.h
We really need, as a priority, to sort out these include files ASAP,
and stop bunging random stuff into unrelated random headers.  Shouldn't
stuff like roundup_pow_of_two() and long_log2() live somewhere else
other than such a generic run-of-the-mill include such as linux/kernel.h ?
