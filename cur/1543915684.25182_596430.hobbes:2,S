The following is a series of patches related to Unionfs.  They represent a
few code cleanups (suggested or inspired by comments on the previous set of
patches), and a few more bug fixes (esp. to cache coherency).  These fixes
were tested on our 2.6.23-rc6 latest code, as well as the backports to
2.6.{22,21,20,19,18,9} on ext2/3/4, xfs, reiserfs, nfs, jffs2, ramfs, tmpfs,
cramfs, and squashfs (where available).  See 
http://unionfs.filesystems.org/
to download backported unionfs code.
