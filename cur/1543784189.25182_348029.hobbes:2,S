I think that should be arch-specific.

Looks fine in that case to have a non-void return.

True.

I was going more by what meaning 'current_ticksource' may give - from
a pure "ticksource" perspective, both (PIT/APIC) are tick sources!
Thats why current_ticksource may not be a good term.

I agree we can remove the separate struct for state and have
recover_time member. Although in x86, it may have to be a wrapper
around mark_offset() since mark_offset does not recover time
completely (it expect the callee to recover one remaining tick).

Martin Schwidefsky (whom I have CC'ed) may be the person who can comment on 
behalf of s390.

I don't see that current_ticksource/current_dyn_tick_timer to be write-heavy.
In fact I see them to be initialied during bootup and after that mostly
read-only. That may not warrant a per-CPU structure.
