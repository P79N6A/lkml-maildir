iwl3945 is still broken as described in
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11326
It is actually quite annoying, as it prevents shutdown when crashed.
The bug discussion mentions a fix (which looks like a workaround,
because there is still a scary message in the log). But at least
the system can be safely shut down.
