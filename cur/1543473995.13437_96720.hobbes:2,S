Subject: While applying patch-2.2.0-pre2.gz
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

While applying the patch, to a tree which I think is all in order, I
got:
  patching file `drivers/nubus/nubus.c'
  Hunk #1 succeeded at 632 with fuzz 1.
It's the only such message.  Normally I ignore these, but when using
patches published by Linus on a clean tree, I expect perfectly clean
patches.
Could someone tell me if this message is to be expected?
Ta,
