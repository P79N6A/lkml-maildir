That would mean a bug in as. __PAGE_OFFSET is unsigned and ~ is documented 
(not a surprise) as "bitwise not". The bitwise not of __PAGE_OFFSET 
(unsigned) is still unsigned. BTW 2.14 does not give warnings with both 
the original statement and the ~ one. This:
        PG=0xC0000000                                                                                                   
        VM=(128 << 20)                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                        
        mov (~PG + 1 - VM), %eax                                                                                        
        mov (-PG - VM), %eax                                                                                            
                                                                                                                        
generate this:
zzzzzzzz:     file format elf32-i386
Disassembly of section .text:
00000000 <.text>:
   0:   a1 00 00 00 38          mov    0x38000000,%eax
   5:   a1 00 00 00 38          mov    0x38000000,%eax
w/out any warnings. And the result is obviously 0x38000000 and 
not 0x37ffffff.
