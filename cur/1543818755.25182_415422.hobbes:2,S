The world is still not perfect :-) Btw. it's kernel 2.6.16, ata_piix,
and a PATA drive. The new ata_piix now uses UDMA/100 while the old IDE
ICH driver always limited the first disk to UDMA/33 for no obvious
reason. So I'm quite happy with libata and can wait a little longer for
acoustic management to be implemented :-)
