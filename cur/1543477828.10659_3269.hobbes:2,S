As the subject says, I patched strace-3.1 to compile on kernel 2.2.0 (-pre7)
I added missing syscalls, fixed compiling problem and cleaned up runtime errors
"umoven: I/O error"
The patch is available at
http://Linuz.sns.it/~max/strace-3.1.patch
Of course I have sumbitted it to the `strace' mantainer too.
Happy hacking,
