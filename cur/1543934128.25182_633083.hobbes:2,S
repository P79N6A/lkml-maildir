nah, this happens all the time for me too - that's why i run a script 
over cleanup patches.

sure, pick up the script from:
 
http://redhat.com/~mingo/misc/q-size-obj-compare
it depends on having the patch in a quilt queue. (and it's really sucky, 
no error checking, etc.)
just run it - it picks up a modified .c file and compares that. If you 
modify multiple files and want to check another one, give that file as 
an argument to the script.
