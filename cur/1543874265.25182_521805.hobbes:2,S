That bloats kernel text all the same so it's much cleaner to just make
the callers explicitly check for NULL then. That said, I'm sorry but I
just don't buy the "overhead" part of your argument since it's one
branch and no extra data cache pressure especially as we're already
doing the BUG_ON and page flag checking.
But, since you're NAKing my patch, we need to get the mempool for from
the original thread in to fix the oops.
