Some numbers...
I my current tree with an allyesconfig build for x86 64bit I see:
136 Section mismatch warnings in total
99 Section mismatch warnings from drivers/
This is with a few patches of mine applied but none of the recently
posted fixes by Adrian.
I am concentrating on:
drivers/pci/
kernel/
mm/
Will post my patches during the weekend if things goes well.
There are some low hanging fruits in drivers/ but I stay away
from these from now expecting others to fix these.
