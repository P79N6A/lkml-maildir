Hello,
Workstations installed with Fedora Core 3 are having problems running 
tcl scripts.  The failure has been isolated to be occurring only when 
the tcl script is accessing NFS mounted IRIX version type=1 
filesystems.  Upgraded to 2.6.10-1-766_FC3 and  glibc 2.3.4-2.fc3 and 
the problem still exists.
I've found a thread titled "Re: Irix NFS servers, again :-)" in the 
linux-kernel archives which describes the failure.
I'm wondering if there will be any type of patch available for the 2.6 
kernel or for glibc to workaround this issue.
Thanks,
Please CC me on any replies as I am not subscribed to the linux-kernel 
mailing list.
Thanks,
Carrie
