i'd really vote for a) because there's nothing worse to overlap xmas with 
than with merge window stress. A couple of key developers wont be around 
either in that timeframe (whose stuff is pending) - making early reaction 
to breakage in the merge window rather laggy and awkward.
A Dec 31 release would be perfect [ 84 days will have passed by then 
since v2.6.27 which was released on Oct 9 ] and we would start 2009 
exactly on point on the planned 3-months / 90 days schedule.
Here's our release cycle track record, and how much it deviates from the 
max-90-days target:
   2.6.28:  64 days [today]
  on 31th:  84 days         -6 days
   2.6.27:  88              -2 days
   2.6.26:  87              -3 days
   2.6.25:  83              -7 days
   2.6.24:  107            +17 days
   2.6.23:  92              +2 days
   2.6.22:  73             -17 days
   2.6.21:  80             -10 days
   2.6.20:  66             -26 days
   2.6.19:  70             -20 days
   2.6.18:  94              +4 days
   2.6.17:  89              -1 day
   2.6.16:  76             -14 days
   2.6.15:  67             -23 days
   2.6.14:  60             -30 days
   2.6.13:  72             -18 days
We lost two and a half weeks with 2.6.24 that was released belatedly on 
Jan 24 - we've made up all the ground for that already.
And the killer argument: there's nothing better to mask a nasty Jan 1 
hangover with than with some merge window stress ;-)
