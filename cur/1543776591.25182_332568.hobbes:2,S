I have also noticed this behaviour; PS2 keyboard, USB mouse.
Just now on linux-2.6.12-RT-V0.7.51-18 while building
linux-2.6.12-RT-V0.7.51-23 with make -j5. My desktop experience
became quite bumpy, the mouse pointer was very _very_ choppy and
when pressing the down arrow to access the next email message
in evolution it seemed like the key release event was delayed
and several 10's of messages were scrolled down before it stopped.
I will try again with IRQ 1 and events/* chrt'ed to fifo-99.
Ok, then my system is almost unusable but the keyboard works flawlesly.
The mouse was unmovable. I did a make clean; make -j5 on the kernel.
This on a dual athlon system.
