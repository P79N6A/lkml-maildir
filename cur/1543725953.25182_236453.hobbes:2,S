Another fix is to copy from a non-brain damaged window, such as a gui
text editor window (nedit, for example).
I'm guessing that the tabs are lost in the cut or copy operation, not in
the paste operation.
But file insertion is, in general, a sufficiently winning choice that I
think it's better just to get in the habit of always inserting patches
that way, at least on email clients that support it.
