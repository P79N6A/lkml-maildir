As a matter of fact I completely missed Arjan's point because I thought
you described these locks according to lockdep's report, and there is
an information about read or write... Since, you still seem to guess
above about possible scenario, maybe it would be easier to show this
report (and maybe a piece of this code if possible)?
Btw., if it were like you're suggesting, it still shouldn't make any
difference: if thread #3 is only waiting for the lock taken for reading,
then I can't see why thread #2 has to wait for anything. Probably more
dangerous, at least for lockdep, could look taking down_write(A) by
thread #1 in between, but if it all were possible only within one
thread, then still there should be no reason to change good program
only to please lockdep.

I'm not sure I can understand your plan, but I doubt there should be
such problems with taking rwsem for sleeping, so maybe it would be
better to figure out what really scares lockdep, to fix the right place?
