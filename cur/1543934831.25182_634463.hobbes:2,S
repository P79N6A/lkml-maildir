EDD 1 provides the I/O base of each BIOS device so you can cross corelate
at least each IDE device with the BIOS identifier. EDD 3 provides paths
in multiple forms including PCI identifiers which serve the same purpose.
Unfortunately our EDD boot code doesn't capture the right bits in all
these cases.
