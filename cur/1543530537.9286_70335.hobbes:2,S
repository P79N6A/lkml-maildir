   pre2-3 defines MADV_SPACEAVAIL in asm-alpha/mman.h and MADV_FREE in
   asm-sparc/mman.h.
   These defines are not used anywhere else in the kernel - and therefore
   the madvise function will return EINVAL for these defines.
   Is this really desired?  
They are values provided by OSF and Solaris respectively.
If this makes for a big issue wrt. glibc we could move them to
the OSF/Solaris emulation code on Alpha and Sparc but I think
this would be really silly and would like to not have to do this.
