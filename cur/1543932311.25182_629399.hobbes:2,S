Requirement is to ensure the address is really a kernel_text address and doesn't
lie in __init section. Hence I used persistent_kernel_text_address().

I don't think so, symbol_put() makes use of lookup_symbol() within __start_ksymtab
and  stop_ksymtab.

Yes, usage of symbol_put_addr() cause the BUG() if it fails
to find the address in core kernel.

I think it is better to make use of new function than sacrificing 
__init function symbol information in backtrace.
