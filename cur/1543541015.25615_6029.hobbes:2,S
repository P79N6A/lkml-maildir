I'm not sure if I like tunables.  My feeling after playing around with 
VMS for a few years is that it's next to impossible to get all these 
tunables right.  Having a tunable usually means "we can't get this right
so we'll just blame the user (admin) for using bad values".  Of course
sometimes tunables are needed, but I'd like as few as possible, or they
should at least ble automatically managed unless the user sets them
explicitly.
