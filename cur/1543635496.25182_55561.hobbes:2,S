hi,
i am currently exploring some power optimization algorithm for HDs
exploiting multiple power states.
i am looking for suggestions to generate a test bench simulating user
activity. i will have to open and read/write to files on the basis of a
trace file. currently i'm doing it in a very ad hoc fashion. i have some
100 dummy files of varying sizes and generating random read/write
requests. any better way would be appreciated. 
thanks,
mukesh
