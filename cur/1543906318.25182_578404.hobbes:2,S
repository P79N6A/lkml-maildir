Then that's very good :)  I was just wondering on what possibly happened to 
the problem since the person who forwarded your concern from the ck list to 
the lkml (I don't subscribe to the ck list) didn't have a follow-up after a 
few days.
And as far as the public list archives are concerned, there were no stats 
posted as Ingo had asked for.  It seems though that you had done privately, 
then that's very good.
Since your problem had already been posted online, I thought that any 
person who might've had a similar problem like yours would benefit from 
knowing what steps got undertaken to address the problem.  I particularly 
was interested in your problem since I myself do a lot of music in Linux. 
I'm very sure that if your problem got discussed on-line, many linux-user 
musicians/programmers would benefit from it, like myself.
Sorry if I have offended you and please accept my apologies.
Thank you very much.
Best Regards,
Carlo
