I explained this in my answer to Ingo...

Random can be expensive. At the moment is FIFO. I'm missing though how 
this can be a security flaw, when the legacy one is exactly predictable.

I can do a new syscall, no problem (I actually even slightly prefer). We 
cannot break dup2() and F_DUPFD though, so we have to handle those too.
I was just trying to use Linus suggestion of using sus_dup2().

Ohh, my last work yesterday was changing procfs/base.c to have them show 
up in there. We have quite a few flags available (31 or 63) to be 
assicated with each fd, so I guess we could use one for that.

Yeah :D

Yes, that's the count of open fds.

If you look a few lines below, there's also (this is inside the lagacy 
fd allocator BTW):
	if (fd >= current->signal->rlim[RLIMIT_NOFILE].rlim_cur)
		goto out;
So the POSIX behaviour does not change. You cannot dup2() to an fd higher 
than RLIMIT_NOFILE (when using legacy fd allocation), *and* you cannot 
open more than RLIMIT_NOFILE files.
This means that if you have RLIMIT_NOFILE==1000 and you have 999 files 
open in the nonsequential area, you can only open one file in the legacy 
area.
