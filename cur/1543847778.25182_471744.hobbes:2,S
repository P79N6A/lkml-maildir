Oh, wait wait. I don't really understand your sentence.
Why can't you use /dev/random?

/dev/hw_random should never be touched by anything else than rngd.
rngd takes the data from /dev/hw_random, _verifys_ it and puts it into
the normal /dev/random pools.
The verification step is really important.
So I would like to ask the other way around. Why should be put this code
into the kernel, while it works in userspace as good (or, some people may
argue it is even better in userspace, because it can more easily be exchanged,
debugged and configured. Whatever)
