Alan,
Ok, how do I go about determining that?  The machine
I have is a brand-spankin' new IBM x-series 350 with
4 900MHz Xeon processors.  The system bios can 
recognize all of the 16320MB of memory at startup.
If those patches work, it will save our butts as
we have a major conversion project that hinges on
this.  
Thanks,
jwh
