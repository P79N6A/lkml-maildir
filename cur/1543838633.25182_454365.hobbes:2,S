I think except for the ACPI bits which I already fixed in this patch
everything else was linuxy already.

I'm for splitting out in ACPI/non ACPI (with CONFIG for mpparse), but not for 
sharing.  I want the freedom to change mpparse's internal data structures without 
caring for i386.
The first step would be to get rid some of the hacks that convert ACPI into
mpparse.
