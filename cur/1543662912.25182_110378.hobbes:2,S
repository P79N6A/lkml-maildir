Several options:
- Create a custom mapping driver with hard coded partitions, like most
  in drivers/mtd/maps.
- Use a partition table parser and put the partition table into flash.
- Look at the documentation to cmdline.c or browse through the mtd
  archives. (not sure, haven't looked at it myself yet)
