This might be because time does not run correctly, see below.

I think I have an idea on what's going on; Your system does not wake to
APIC interrupt, and the system timer updates time only on other interrupts.
I'm experiencing the same on a loaner ThinkPad T30.
I'll try to do another patch today. Meanwhile it now should work
without lapic in cmdline.
