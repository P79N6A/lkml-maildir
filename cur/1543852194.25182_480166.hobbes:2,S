The previous global load balancing tasket could be an interesting data point.
Do you see a lot of imbalance in the system with the global tasket?  Does it
take prolonged interval to reach balanced system from imbalance?
Conceptually, it doesn't make a lot of sense to serialize load balance in the
System.  But in practice, maybe it is good enough to cycle through each cpu
(I suppose it all depends on the user environment).  This exercise certainly
make me to think in regards to what is the best algorithm in terms of efficiency
and minimal latency to achieve maximum system throughput.  Does kernel really
have to do load balancing so aggressively in polling mode? Perhaps an event
driven mechanism is a better solution.
