Some sort of generic.  I have others that I could try, including a winbond 
W8685AF (I have marked it on the back 3BCh for some reason - maybe a 
nonstandard address, original price $21.78, made in China) and a Korean 
/Malaysian model with more chips .  Both have jumpers:  in one case
JP1 JP2 and in the other a 3-pin J4.
I have the lack of scroll in two computers with cards that I cannot easily 
look at.
These are all 16-bit half-length cards (length about the width of my hand) 
with parport build-in (which does not print in linux - another problem 
with using two video cards). 
This is certainly a busy mail list!
