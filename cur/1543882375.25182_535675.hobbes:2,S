Several points on this...
First, I don't think this is accelerated in the way you mean, the 
machine is a test server, with motherboard video using the 945G video 
driver. Given the limitations of the support in that setup, I don't 
think it qualified as "true 3D hardware," although I guess I could try 
using the vesafb version as a test.
The 2nd thing I note is that on FC6 this scheduler seems to confuse 
'top' to some degree, since the glxgears is shown as taking 51% of the 
CPU (one core), while the state breakdown shows about 73% in idle, 
waitio, and int. image attached.
After I upgrade the kernel and cfs to the absolute latest I'll repeat 
this, as well as test with vesafb, and my planned run under heavy load.
