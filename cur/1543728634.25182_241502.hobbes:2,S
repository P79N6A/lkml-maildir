Even if it is not a long non-preemptible section, mlockall-test is still
doing *something* that causes an xrun in jackd.  Maybe interrupts are
being disabled for a long time.  Whatever it is, it cannot possibly be a
jackd bug, because mlockall by an unrelated, normal-priority process
causes an xrun in the SCHED_FIFO jackd process.
