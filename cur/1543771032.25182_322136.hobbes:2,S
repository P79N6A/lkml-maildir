Hi!
I think editing superblock with hexedit is less dangerous than using
raid-tools --- with editor I know what changes I have made and I can
revert them. With raid-tools, if you create wrong /etc/raidtab (original
was on failed volume too), it will trash superblocks completely.
I still think it's stupid that Linux modifies RAID superblocks into
irreversible state.
BTW. that server doesn't have CD drive. It was installed from network.
