Hi all,
[Reposting to this thread, that is closer to
 the subject... first posted in "Preparations for ZD's ... "
 our ideas are in the same direction - let the path decide,
 but with your idea the paths have to be different from root.
 Mine can be local /Roger]
How about using the path to decide if the page is static or not,
instead of using hacks that will never be complete enough.
My idea:
- if the path a contains a directory named "static" then the page
  is static and can be handled by khttpd. If khttpd is not running
  it will work anyway, without polluting the environment with hacks.
Example: 
  $WEBROOT/logo.gif
will be handled by user space http server (if $WEBROOT does not contain
a "static" directory)
  $WEBROOT/static/logo.gif
can be handled by khttpd if it is running.
=> Any page designer can decide (think private home pages), he would
know if a
   page, gif ... is static or not.
Implementation details.
 Searching for a specific string in a text are described in several
 text books, like Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick. One that I think is
 promising is Rabin-Karp.
 "Moving hash value" - can be compared to moving average over
 characters. When it matches you got a likely candidate, by using
 weights you could almost avoid false indications.
 [watch out for ./static.html ! probably the match should be
  with "/static/"]

The Internet interprets Windows as damage, 
             and routes around it.
