We are preparing a large set of patches (each to be sent as a separate 
email per your SOP, but all tested together in a thorough testing 
procedure), which includes this patch, plus the kdev fix, plus all 2.4 
fixes.  We expect to send it out on monday, we just found a bug in the 
patches as a set that was not present in them individually.
