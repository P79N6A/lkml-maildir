I'm using 048 at the moment. Works great, but if I replace start_udev with 
udevstart in my init scripts as you suggest, it all goes horribly wrong...
udevstart is just a symlink to udev, but start_udev is a script which:
 - mounts ramfs
 - runs udevstart
 - makes some extra nodes not exported by sysfs (stdin/out/err)
So I guess I need to migrate this functionality to my init system before I can 
call udevstart directly.
Is that list of  'extra nodes not exported by sysfs likely to change?'
