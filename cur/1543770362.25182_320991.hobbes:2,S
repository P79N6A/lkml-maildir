Hi,
I saw this exact same error (EXT3-fs error (device dm-x): ext3_readdir:
bad entry in directory #nnnnnnn: rec_len % 4 != 0 - offset=0, inode=xxxxxxxx,
rec_len=...
from time to time in my non-SMP RAID system with 512Mb RAM, with ext3 on LVM on top of RAID5.
Never caused actual corruption - run FSCK, no errors, remount rw
successfully until next time; error rarely in the same place, but always
in a directory and rec_len % 4 != 0.  Looks like an 'in-kernel' thing,
because (e.g.) running find on the volume after remounting rw produced
no issues, so presumably the on-disk directory wasn't *really* the
issue.
Filesystems between about 8 and 50 Gb, and not what I'd characterise as a
heavy load.
This was with about 2.6.4 - 2.6.7.  I'm running 2.6.11 now and haven't
seen it in some time; so it was either fixed by 2.6.11, or mounting ro
by default has just reduced my exposure.
