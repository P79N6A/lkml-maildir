Is this on the console and if it is I assum you are uing vgacon. It could 
be the S# card has a broken implemenation. This wouldn't be the first.
Their has been a patch sometime for vesafb to work properly with S3 cards.
S3 framebuffer anyone? I remember their has been scathered work on this
but I never seen anything come to light for this.

video.S puts information into struct screen_info which then is used later
by vgacon or vesafb. 
P.S
   I plan to make struct screen_info go away in 2.5.X.
