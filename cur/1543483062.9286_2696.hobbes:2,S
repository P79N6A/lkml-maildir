I know.

Well it fullfils these assumptions then. But what about SMP boxes? Can't
one processor execute init/remove_bh while the other one runs other
init/remove_bh or enable/disable_bh? It could lead to bh_mask corruption
then because expressions like ( bh_mask |= 1 << nr ) are not atomic.

I think it's not me who has problem seeing the possible races :)

I was not talking about bh_active field at all. But when you mention it,
the double locking is not very nice implementation, is it? You can
delay the software interrupt for whole 210 usec, and in theory,
there is a chance you can delay it forever.
BTW, don't you know why m68k does not trigger the software irq line
in mark_bh()? I thought this is what software irq is for...

P.S. I do not cc: Linus as it seems he doesn't care anyway...
