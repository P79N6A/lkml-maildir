Thanks Jakub...
I didn't get the exact reason in the previous thread...so rephrased my
question to make it more specific this time.

This is what I was looking at...
Thanks a lot.

I explained it 3 days ago, so once again:
x86-64 binaries and shared libraries are required to handle page sizes
up
to 1MB and as RE and RW segments can't be on the same page, this means
they
must not share the same 1MB page.
Just google for ELF_MAXPAGESIZE or look at the libraries using readelf
-Wl.
