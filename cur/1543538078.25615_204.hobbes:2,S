Take a look at my "patch #3" to see if it looks "better".  It's not
calling any dangerous functions and it gives other advantages (lowever
console_lock contention... it might be better?

But my point all along is that it only addes a spin_lock and spin_unlock
on a very low contended lock (unless you're doing tons of printk's, in
which you would spin on the console_lock isntead) to the common
case.  Only the uncommon case that you only hit durring debugging gets
effected...

Well, from the general kernel perspective there's a highly contended
console_lock that is having to be held through a vsprintf, and in my
perspective, deadlock is not happy.  :)
