This seems to hint at some heirarchy of ubc? How would that heirarchy be
used? I cant find anything in the patch which forms this heirarchy
(basically I dont see any place where beancounter_findcreate() is called
with non-NULL 2nd arg).

This sets barrier to 0. Is this value of 0 interpreted differently by
different controllers? One way to interpret it is "dont allocate any
resource", other way to interpret it is "don't care - give me what you
can" (which makes sense for stuff like CPU and network bandwidth).
