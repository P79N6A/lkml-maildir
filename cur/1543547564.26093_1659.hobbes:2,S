This is what I had originally. It looks like someone has changed
it. Complain to Linus (and send him your patch). Please Cc: me so I
can see any discussions that might ensue.

In keeping with Richards wishes, what happened?  Did this just get accidently
backed out, or was it intentional?  I know there are a few other config options
which are like this (inital ramdisk is set to n if ramdisk is m, all of the
raid options are set to n if raid is n, instead of being not set at all).
