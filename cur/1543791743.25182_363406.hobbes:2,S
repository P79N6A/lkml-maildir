Andy,
I know it would be cool to get a mail from Linux or AM or AC, but you 
really have no right to expect an answer from anybody in particular, 
especially with a reasonably straight forward question of a general nature.
After all if you phone Microsoft to discuss whether you should configure 
Windows to optimize for foreground or background tasks you don't expect 
to speak to Bill Gates or Steve Balmer do you?
In my view it is bad form and shows you up when you do this.
BTW, you are top posting again.
(Finally, this may be a cheap shot, but it is possible that posting to 
LKML with an AOL email address carries some stigma :-)
regards,
Felix
