I think setting CN bits appropriatlely is the task of the upper
layer protocol anyway. The only thing is that the upper layers need
to know whether the input queue is congested. Maybe the netif_rx() code
could set an skb->rx_congested bit when it delivers packets to the
upper layer while the backlog queue is in congested state. (Maybe not
really necessary, the upper layer could also query the congestion state
by atomic_read(&netdev_dropping)).
