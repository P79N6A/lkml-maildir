Doh.  It's obviously much cleaner and more efficient that way.
Have any of the other patch submitters added a comment to note this in
include/linux/genhd.h?  hd_struct doesn't have any mention of start_sect
and nr_sect being stored in sectors of 512bytes.  But maybe that's just
to weed out fools like me.
