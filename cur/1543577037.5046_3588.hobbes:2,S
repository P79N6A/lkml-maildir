Sorry about that, it was an undo that happened back at pre10 when the
correct changes were applied; however, we may rip it out if I can finish
the execute_diagnostics call to clear the PDIAG line and get the drive to
report the impedence decay to correctly address the bit13 of word 93.
For now it was a goof to an incomplete feature, but that was the only
goof I am aware of at this point.
