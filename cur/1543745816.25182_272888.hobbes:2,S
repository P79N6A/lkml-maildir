Subject: [PATCH 2.4] I2C updates for 2.4.28 (1/5)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Original report and discussion:
http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg18839.html
Bottom line:
i2c_register_entry shouldn't rely on the procname field to detect the
end of the control table, but on the ctl_name field. The latter is
guaranteed to be non-zero except for the table terminator, the former
can be null even in the middle of the table.
The bug wasn't caught so far because all users of this function
(basically the lm_sensors project's drivers) were exporting all entries
through /proc so procname was never null (except for the table
terminator, obviously).
Credits go to Louis-Martin Cote for discovering the bug and proposing a
fix.
