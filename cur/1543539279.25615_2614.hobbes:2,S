When I try to mount a cd with linux-2.4-test4 I get the following
errormessage. I can use the CD anyway so it desn't seem to be to serius.
hdd: packet command error: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error } 
hdd: packet command error: error=0x50 
ATAPI device hdd: 
  Error: Illegal request -- (Sense key=0x05) 
  Invalid command operation code -- (asc=0x20, ascq=0x00) 
  The failed "Read Disc Info" packet command was:  
  "51 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 " 
Also when I do
cat /proc/ide/ide1/hdd/identity
I get
hdd: drive_cmd: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest } 
The hardware is an antique creative 2x cd-rom connected to an 
ide-interface on a soundblaster 16 ISA card. It have worked without
problems on linux-2.0.x and linux-2.2.x before I tried the 2.4.0-test4.
If someone is interested I could supply any data you need. Just tell my
how and what.
