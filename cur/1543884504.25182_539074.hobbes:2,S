What's your reasoning here?  Having different module names allows people to 
compile both stacks and switch between them as they wish.
Another point in favour of different module names is that the new stack 
doesn't actually provide the same user space interfaces as the old stack. 
Basically, no applications use the raw kernel interfaces and the new stack is 
only compatible at the library level.  In the light of this, I think it's fair 
to change the module names.
As for putting the new stack in drivers/ieee1394 - I don't know, I think it 
makes sense to keep the new stack in it's own directory.  If it's a deal 
breaker for inclusion, let's talk about moving it, but it would be nice if you 
could elaborate just a little bit beyond "NACK".
thanks,
Kristian
