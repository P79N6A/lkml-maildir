iirc it was to prevent IRQ-context code from getting a hold on
current->io_context and then playing around with it while it's getting
freed.
In practice, a preempt_disable() there would probably suffice (ie: if this
CPU is running an ISR, it won't be running exit_io_context as well).  But
local_irq_disable() is clearer, albeit more expensive.

To prevent races against elv_unregister(), I guess.
