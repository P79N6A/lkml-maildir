Hey Ted,
Considering that the kernel was being developed without BK for a long time
it's rather obvious that _any_ version control system could have improved
the situation.   BK gets credit for improving the situation, but much of
that improvment could have been achieved with any of the simpler and truly
free options too.
Even today, some top developers do not use BK and manage to get along
fine.  BK offers some advantages over simpler version control offerings
but the price is too high.  It's disappointing to see so many top
developers not give a damn about its costs and ignore the difficulties it
creates for many.
Cheers,
Sean
