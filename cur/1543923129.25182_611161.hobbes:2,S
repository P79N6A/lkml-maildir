Rather than overload an existing config option, why not add one with the
specific semantics you want: CONFIG_UNSTABLE_UABI.  The problem seems
like one which which may occur again, though one hopes not too often.  I
guess the risk is that people will leave their subsystems depending on
it permanently (sysfs?), so it ends up being set all the time and
becomes as useless as EXPERIMENTAL...
