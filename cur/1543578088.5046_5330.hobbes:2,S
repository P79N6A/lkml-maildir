Right. I'm pretty sure ftape-3.04d (as included in current 2.2 and 2.4
kernels) doesn't maintain read-compatibility with ftape-2.08. (See
Documentation/ftape.txt "Changes", and drivers/char/ftape/RELEASE-NOTES
about "sftape" being gone.)
I think your best bet is to read the tape using your 2.0.36 kernel
with ftape 2.08, reboot into 2.2.16, format the tape (or get a new one),
and then dump the data again using ftape 3.04d. Oh, and DON'T use the
built-in compression support. It's gone in ftape 4 :-)
