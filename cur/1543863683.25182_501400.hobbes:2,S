No longer matters as I can't use port.type. See next comment.

I just found that out the hard way, it get's overwritten during autoconfig* and
ends up back at PORT_16550A.
I'm now trying to use my own iotype = UPIO_DWAPB and I've added it to all cases
that check for UPIO_MEM. However at boot time I'm getting:
	"serial8250: ttyS0 at *unknown* (irq = 27) is a 16550A".
It looks like something outside of 8250.c must be checking for UPIO_MEM, I'm
looking into it.

Understood, getting rid of them is why I started this thread.
