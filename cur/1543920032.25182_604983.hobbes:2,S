I dont know how to proceed with this issue. The more I think about it, the
more I am convinced that using sum_exec_runtime together with sampled utime
and stime will never guarantee monotonicity for utime and stime in proc. 
Just imagine an process with 9 ticks for utime and 0 ticks for stime. If
we now sample one tick for stime (but having only a small increase in
sum_exec_runtime) the next utime value will only be 90% of the last value. 
So returning to the 2.6.22 model seems to be the safest solution until 
somebody else comes up with an idea that works proper.
Ingo, any opinion?
