Hi,
    Having some problems with an ethernet card, netgear,
    (Ethernet controller: Lite-On Communications Inc LNE100TX (rev 33)),
    when running under smp. This is with stock redhat 7.3 distro.
    Seems to be running the tulip driver .9.15.-pre10. Under heavy
    ethernet usage, the system just hangs. Is there known isssues
    with the tulip driver?
Cheers,
Tony.
