Yes, but it can fire off a child in the child cgroup to do something,
and go on on its own cgroup when the child finishes.

Because the point of this is to provide some restrictions to otherwise
privileged users, and cgroups only provides dac-based permissions.
But that doesn't mean that I'm not doing too much.  I could just add a
CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_CONT_OVERRIDE+CAP_SYS_ADMIN check, and not restrict
which cgroups a task can move to.  Does that sound good?
