Quite, I think manual usage of page_mkclean_one() on the vma gotten from
mmap() along with properly setting page->index is the simplest solution
to make work.
Making page_mkclean(struct page *) work for remap_pfn/vmalloc_range()
style mmaps would require extending rmap to work with those, which
includes setting page->mapping to point to a anon_vma like object.
But that sounds like a lot of work, and I'm not sure its worth the
overhead, because so far all users of remap_pfn/vmalloc_range() have
survived without.
