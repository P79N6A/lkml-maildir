minixfs is dependant of the native byte order if I remember correctly.
Ie. minix and thus minixfs was available natively on m68k systems and
changing big endian systems to expect little endian file systems would
therefore be wrong. If you want to do something like this you need to
add run time detection of the file system byte order.
