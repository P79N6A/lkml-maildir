Well, I use them all over the place to keep accounts on separate /tmp's,
etc.  It may not be the norm yet, but the general availability of
pam_mount etc, and the implementation of shared subtrees may well change

But then if that happens, as Al points out, AA might be able to
embrace rather than fight it.
