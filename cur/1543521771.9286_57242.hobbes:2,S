Sorry, Feb 30th doesn't exist for a quite a few hundred years. The problem
is:
February has 29 days when "year % 4 = 0", except when "year % 100 = 0" and
NOT when
"year % 400 = 0". Some lazy programmers may have troubles with this "2000 %
400 = 0" ;)
I was almost destroying all the calendars I have here :)
See you,
