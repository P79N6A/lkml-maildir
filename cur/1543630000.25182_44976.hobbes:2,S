Subject: [PATCH 2.4] Thread group exit problem reappeared.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

A long time ago there was thread group code that at exit time tried to
reparent a task to another task in the thread group.  I discovered a major
race condition in this code, and submitted a patch that removed it.  This
patch was accepted in, I thin, 2.4.12.  The code reappeared in 2.4.18,
breaking applications that use thread groups.
As part of chasing this down, I figured out a way to remove the race
condition while still preserving this behavior.  I've attached a patch
against 2.4.19-pre8 that fixes it.
