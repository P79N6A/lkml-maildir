Rather than go by the manufacturer, woudln't you be better off identifying
the BIOS ? (as that is what is primarily using the nvram).

Agreed. Which is why I mentioned in an earlier mail that it doesn't
belong in kernel space. To reiterate: Set the amount of exported data
from /dev/nvram to the size of the biggest nvram that's known.
Let applications that use it do the sizing.

If the algorithm Riley presented isn't possible from userspace,
then either use the table approach, or (yeuch: a kernel space function
addressable from userspace, via a function call or whatever)
