Subject: VFS / struct inode_operation: Extend permission() + add syscall?

The permission() function in the VFS (and the permission()
inode operations) only work for the current user.
Why is that?
What are the arguments against making adding a permission_uid()
function, with the uid a parameter? What are the reasons against
adding a syscall to test which permissions a user has for a file
or path?
Daemons like Samba now need to fork(), and change owner
to tested permissions. It seems more reasonable to
allow root to test permissions via a system call.
I have heard that this question has been asked in the past,
with no response.
