You are mixing two completely different things.
Functions like gethostent() and catopen() are explicitly allowed to be
implemented using file descriptors.  If this is allowed the standard
contains appropriate wording.
Other functions like setlocale() do use file descriptors, yes, but
these are not kept.  Before the function returns they are closed.
This can cause disruptions in other threads which find descriptors not
allocated sequentially but this has to be taken into account.  Rules
for multi-threaded applications are different.  A single-threaded
application will not see such a difference.
Now, the standards do not allow POSIX mutexes to be implemented using
file descriptors.  The same is true for unnamed POSIX semaphores.  So
Linus is right, though for a different reason than he thought.
The situation is a bit different for named POSIX semaphores.  These
can be implemented using file descriptors.  But they don't have to and
IMO they shouldn't.  A memory reference based semaphore implementation
would allow a named semaphore to be implemented using
  fd = open (name)
  addr = mmap (..fd..)
  close (fd)
  sem_syscall (addr)
i.e., it can be mapped to a memory reference again.
