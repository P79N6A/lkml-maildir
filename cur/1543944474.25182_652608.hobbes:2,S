*duh*
OK, I plead the lack of caffeine when reading the original posting.
-r used to be "reproduce the changeset", but that _excludes_ committer.
Nevermind.
FWIW, I prefer to keep many branches and use suffix (.b<number>) to
distinguish between them.  And cherry-pick/reorder/split/collapse
as needed on transition to the next one.  At least that avoids
some problems for secondary trees - branches do not jump.
Since branches tend to be relatively small, they don't get conflicts
that open and I can postpone switch to new branch until it really
has to be done.
I don't know how to deal with tricky branch topology; every time when I
get to structure like <branch X is on top of Y+Z> it becomes very painful
to work on all these topics in parallel.  For trees maintained by different
people... <shudder>
