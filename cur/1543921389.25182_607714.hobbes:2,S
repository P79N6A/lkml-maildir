Ah... I got confused as to what you were measuring and where. Looking at
nfs_proc_create(), there is indeed a missing call to
nfs_mark_for_revalidate(). The reason why you need such a call being the
usual one: NFSv2 doesn't provide post-op attributes for the directory.
The patch below ought to fix the problem.
Cheers
