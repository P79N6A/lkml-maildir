Gee, 2.6.16-mm2 was a long time ago.
Tried sysrq?
	echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq
	<wait for hang>
	ALT-SYSRQ-P or ALT-SYSRQ-T
Is the NMi watchdog enabled?  Boot with `nmi_watchdog=1', make sure that
the NMI counts are incrementing in /proc/interrupts.
Failing all that, testing 2.6.17-rc1 would be interesting.
