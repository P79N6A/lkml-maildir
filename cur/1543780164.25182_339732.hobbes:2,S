Hi,
I couldn't help noticing that the Sangoma drivers distributed with the
current kernel are slightly out of date and was wondering whether there
was any reason for this?
For example the kernel copy of sdla.c was last updated Mar 20, 2001 while
the version contained in the drivers distributed on sangoma.com[1] was
last updated Dec 15. 2003.
