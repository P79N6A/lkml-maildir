I have been doing some more intensive testing on RAID with recent Linux. 
This machine has a RAID-1 array of two IBM 46G ATA-66 disks on the same
channel (hda and hdb).  Here is the df output:
Filesystem           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part3
                       1228916   1180672     48244  96% /
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part2
                         23333      7405     14724  33% /boot
/dev/md/0             43510604  18926016  24584588  43% /mnt
/mnt is the RAID array in question.  It is a ReiserFS file system, it had
previously been run as Ext2 and I had run all the same tests on it (and
more).  However I am not certain that it is ReiserFS, it could be that
ReiserFS triggers some other bug in the kernel.
Here is the top output showin the kswapd process being in D state
permanently, and nothing much happening (the load average is high because of
a few "ls" processes that are stuck on "ls -la /mnt").

Here is the PS output showing the bonnie++ process that is stuck.  At this
time the hard drive access light was always off (so the system is indeed
stuck).
root@test:~#ps ax | grep bonn

This test is using 40 files of size 1G for testing (40G of temporary storage
in total).  Previous tests of 4G and 8G went fine.
