It could be something like cpu-disconnect-while-apic-being-hammered
race... Hell i dunno, i can only see some patterns from my own
experiences.

A status bit would be preferred since that would fix any races that
might exist. As for ide it would be preferred to have non-static delays
but if it's not possible to solve in another way then, by all means =).
But in this case, this is a specific workaround, and it works without it
if you disable the AMD cooler thing.

I dunno, i have never used a machine with IO-APIC on so i dunno whats
normal. But it grows a lot faster than nmi_watchdog=2.

6h 46 mins tells me that this works.
(peak nonworking uptime is still below 2hours)
