This has been resolved as an IPv6 routing issue - lkml.org also has an AAAA
record but Redeeman's IPv6 is not fully functional.
Regarding the packages.gentoo.org kernel, 'NQWOLK' has been coined :-)
Alessandro, shall we try the MSS clamp route to further determine what is
going on? With packages.gentoo.org the TCP behaviour confirmed that a 'smart
firewall' was to blame and not something that stamped over the wscale,
perhaps we can narrow down your problem as well.
Thanks.
