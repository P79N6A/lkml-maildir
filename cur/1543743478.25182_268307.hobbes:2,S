Yes.  Long long is a ISO C99 type guaranteed to be at least 64 bits.
Thus, 
#if defined(__GNUC__) && !defined(__STRICT_ANSI__)
is wrong; it's in fact actively harmful.
Furthermore, this should only be used by the kernel, since this comes
from <stdint.h> in userspace.
<stdint.h> really should be a compiler-provided header file.  Sigh.
