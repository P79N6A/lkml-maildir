Tapes are a pain; but at the type of 40GB range is it worth considering
a pile of external USB/Firewire hard drives?
(I've also had some bad luck with IDE RAIDs on Linux; now that the
western digital 200GBs have the new firmware on I thought they might
be stable - until 800GBs of RAID fell on its face last week. We've
now pulled the promise and hpt card out and replaced them with
a 3ware-8 port.)
