Hello there,
I just tried to compile Linux kernel 2.6.18.3 with the Intel C
C compiler.
It said
arch/x86_64/kernel/../../i386/kernel/msr.c(198): remark #593: variable "rv" 
was set but never used
The source code is
    size_t rv;
I have checked the source code and I agree with the compiler.
Suggest delete local variable.
Regards
David Binderman
