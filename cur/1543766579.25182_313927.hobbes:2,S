Bah.
The _information_ is there, it's right on the stack-frame in the original 
CS/SS etc.
I'll take reliable and obvious code _any_ day over hacky code just to get 
me an "error code" for something that just isn't very interesting.
In other words, your code is not only ugly, it's also the kind of code 
that makes you go "how does that work". 
I think it's a lot more important that the kernel obviously work 
correctly.
