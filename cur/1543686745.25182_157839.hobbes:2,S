Yes it does. Preemption and order of scheduling is determined entirely by the 
dynamic priority.

Any task of better (dynamic) priority will preempt it.

No, the timeslice granularity is a hard cut off where a task gets rescheduled 
and put at the back of the queue again. If there is no other task of equal or 
better priority it will just start again.

Better dynamic priority.
