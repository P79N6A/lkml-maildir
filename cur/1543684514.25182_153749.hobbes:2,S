Yes, i thought it worked in a different manner, as Jens Axboe pointed
out. I was under the impression that it worked differently.

Queue plugging?

Oh? from what i've gathered from my somewhat on and off readings of lkml
i thought that 1, AS added a delay to gather additional requests prior
to sending the request to the disk. 2, (as i found out now) it also
waits before moving the head.
Thats what i wanted to by pass in the "hey, i'm just loading my 10 bytes
config file, and nothing else is happening" scenario.

Which sounds odd...

Lets say that when the request queue has reached a certain length, the
disk is loaded.
I also have to say that i have no clue of the kernels real inner
workings esp not the io layer. I have only played with QoS, and i
started when it was undocumented.. =).
Lets say that we could use a CBQ queue with the right bw limits. Now,
lets say that when 70% of that bw is filled, we use a diff approach to
treating the data... We might drop new syns since we might be paranoid
about getting DoSed (stupid example, i know).
Now, Translate this in to the IO part. When we have a request backlog
for X entries during Y 'timeunits' we use a diff way to access the disk.
And since we know that when this mode is triggered, we have a backlog of
requests that we can just feed AS and thus make as do it's best.
Lower latency on small things and better throughput, what could be wrong
about that?
[Side note: In my understanding of SFQ it does 'nothing' to data that
can be sent directly, but queues when it can't (due to load)]
[Also: load is just a very fuzzy term for something that might be highly
complex. ie, the right value for the job in determining how the request
should be handled.]
