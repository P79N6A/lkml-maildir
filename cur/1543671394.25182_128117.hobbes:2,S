Subject: [PATCH] Support worst case cache line sizes as config option

This mirrors a change that has been in the SuSE/aa 2.4 kernel for a long time.
For a generic binary kernel you really want to assume the worst case
cache line size.  That's the P4's 128 byte currently.
The overhead of having the cache line size bigger on other CPUs is not
that bad, but if it is too small it will cost you dearly on SMP and
even a bit on UP in device drivers. 
This patch adds a new CONFIG_X86_GENERIC option for this. It currently
only forces 128byte cache lines, but could be used for more in the future.
