OK can we just have a technical discussion?

1. All compact flash have an inbuilt ATA controller. I.E. they can be
     used exactly like a harddisk, directly off the IDE controller of a 
motherboard.
     I.E. no need for PCMCIA or any of that. I understood from your 
responses
     that you didn't realise this?
2. Compact Flash in this application (I.E. solid state hard disk) is 
getting very
     popular as prices are tumbling.
3. Having a config parameter (uneeded kludge in my opinion), like hdx=flash
     even if hdx is not a compact flash is confusing. Can we call it 
hdx=probe
     which fits nicely with the noprobe option.

No you didn't. You mentioned a 30 second timeout, but not why it
was caused. Have you seen this yourself or can you point us at who
reported this to you?

Emm, I think *you* were going off describing your application with
a "bazar ata-bridge", not the simple use of a compact flash as a
hard disk.

Actually I thought the final email was a little more concise/informative, thanks.
