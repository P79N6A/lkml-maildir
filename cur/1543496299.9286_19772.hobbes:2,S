Hi.
Iam told that ethernet drivers and such are loaded on demand and once we
access the device.
i have a eepro100 on my system, but i dont see a device file in /dev? do
network device have
device representations?
what does a driver writer has to do to so some other driver that we write
gets automatically loaded?
Cheers,
ashokr
Plug-and-Play is really nice, unfortunately it only works 50% of the time.
To be specific the "Plug" almost always works.
