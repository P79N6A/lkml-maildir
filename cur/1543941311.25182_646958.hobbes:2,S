No, removed.

Ok, changed to eg. reg_config_and_status.

Converted to underscores.

Shared. It'll check if device has interrupt pending, else exit.

Some items are set during initial phase and read only afterwards. This don't 
need to be protected. Nevetheless, I've found some missing locking around 
tx_ready and rx_ready which might cause bugs (eg. hangs).

Unfortunatelly PCMCIA subsystem is full of these and all drivers use them. 
I'll stay consistent for now.
Updated patch v4 will follow.
