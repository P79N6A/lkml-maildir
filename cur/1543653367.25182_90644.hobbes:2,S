I agree, fds are pretty good, and it's nice that they work equally
well with poll/select/sigio as with epoll.
It's just that to write an ideal, general event loop, pollable fds
need to be created on the fly for futexes, signals, timers and aio
requests at least.  Currently this is already done for futexes.  In
addition, some kinds of event result need to return a few words of
data with each event (for example, SIGCHLD events).
Perhaps it's not a bad idea, but I do wonder whether fds created on
the fly for every requested event, and events than can only report
"readable" not anything richer than that are a good solution.
