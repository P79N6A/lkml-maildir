Sounds fine with me. The current behaviour isn't useful anyway.

My comment wasn't against your patch but on a suggestion (or, rather,
on such suggestions in general) for putting a lot of OOM policy into
the kernel. I tried to show that there can be many useful policies
which are hard to implement in the kernel, even if bloat is not an
issue. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough.
