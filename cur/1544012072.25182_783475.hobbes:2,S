I am beginning to accept that some amount of ugliness is inevitable
here :-) I tried to dig through history of SI_ASYNCIO, but did not
find any changes to its definition in siginfo.h in 6 years.

By 'to do this' I assume you are referring to the kill_pid_info_as_uid()
change above ?
IOW, ugly as it is, can we go with the siginfo_from_user() as in the patch ?
