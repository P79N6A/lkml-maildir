But it does neither. Instead, it seg-faults your code!
The problem lies with the original question. The question
referred to "Style" (look at the subject-line). It is
not a question about style, but a question about utility
and design. Style has nothing to do with it.
If you are writing code for an embedded system, the code
must always run even if RAM got trashed from alpha particles
or EMP. In that case, you trap every possible condition and
force a restart off a hardware timer, refreshing everything in
RAM from PROM or NVRAM.
If you are writing code to examine the contents of sys_errlist[],
prior to adding another error-code, then you don't check anything
and it's file-name is probably a.out, compiled from xxx.c.
So, the extent to which one checks for exceptions and provides
utility for handling exceptions depends upon the code design, not
it's style.
