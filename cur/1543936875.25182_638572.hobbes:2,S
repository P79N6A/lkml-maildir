Subject: [PATCH 06/13] writeback: defer writeback on not-all-pages-written
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/15/133

Convert to requeue_io_wait() for case:
	- kupdate cannot write all pages due to some blocking condition;
	- during sync, a file is being written to too fast, starving other
	  files.
In the case of sync, requeue_io_wait() can break the starvation because the
inode requeued into s_more_io_wait will be served _after_ normal inodes, hence
won't stand in the way of other inodes in the next run.
