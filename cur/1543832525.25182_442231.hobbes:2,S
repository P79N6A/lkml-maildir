Yeah, right.  (quoting Kathy Mallory with her usual sarcasm)

I just found 2.6.18-rc1-mm1.  I'll build + check.
I have an Intel ICH7 motherboard with SATA.
Is that close to what you have?

I guess that's from here:
/sys/firmware/acpi/namespace/ACPI/_SB/PCI0/IDES
which contains 2 directories:  PRID and SECD.
Apparently ATA/IDE primary and secondary controllers,
but I'm not sure.  Those empty directory structures
don't tell me much.

"We" need to fix that <NULL> there.
