The funny thing here, Larry, is that to most people (who aren't OS gurus),  
Linux' clone or Plan 9's rfork *are* threads.
I certainly agree that you don't necessarily need two different kernel- 
level kinds of things, but really, most of the time when people talk about  
threads, they don't care one whit how their libraries manage to produce  
threads, as long as those threads actually work.
Threads are a kind of abstraction.
And the argument that you don't need threads when you have state machines  
is exactly as valid as the one that says that you don't need loops when  
you have goto.
Oh, you also don't need subroutines when you have state machines and goto.  
Fancy that!
I've even been told you can do all these things with nothing more than a  
Turing machine ...
