On my amd64 based laptop, I had a failures with both suspend implementations 
(swsusp and suspend2) when I had iommu debugging on. The same config worked 
fine with 2.6.17. I guess something in the delta didn't like iommu usage 
being forced on a Turion. I'm not sure how much time I'll find for further 
debugging, so I'll report it now.
Regards,
Nigel
