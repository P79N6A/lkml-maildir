hmm, I didn't know that there is a change from PCMCIA to cardbus.
Thought still there are lot of pcmcia stuff around. wlan cards, eg my
dial up card (CF card into a PCMCIA adapter). Well I wouldn't abandon
PCMCIA so fast. At least the linux kernel is know for beeing able to use
very old hardware in a very good way ...
