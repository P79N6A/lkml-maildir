I can guess this, but is not true because registers i
modify changed their values.

I use vendor specific call that to change MII and
device specific registers. So the change succeed,
the values are set correctly (the read show so), but
warning appears.

Hm, that looks ok, but kernel oopses bad blaming me
that do request_bulk in interrupt. Actually i use
request_bulk() from my start_xmit() routine. Speaking
of which i have always thought that start_xmit() is
the top half of the driver and executes in process
context. Is that true?

;-)) Thanks, this simplifies my job very much.
