There's something wrong with the network: Your SYN packet that is to
establish the connection to the other machine is never answered by your
"victim".
There's nothing you can do about that. Talk to non-firewalled, working
machines to prevent that. Possibly try to connect() to several sockets
at once (use fork or threads).
