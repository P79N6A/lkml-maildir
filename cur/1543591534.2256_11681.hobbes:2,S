FWIW, I have similar problems with the Radeon 64 VIVO (retail) with my
Abit KT7A.  The DRI people are aware that it's broken but so far it works
for some people and not others, and nobody is exactly sure what the
problem is.  Your best bet is to avoid accelleration for now.
Since you have an AMD chipset, it appears the problem is not limited to
VIA.  That's too bad, I was considering upgrading to an AMD board to get
around this problem (and several others too..)
