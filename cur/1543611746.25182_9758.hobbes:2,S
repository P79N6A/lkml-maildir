Hi!
On 2.4.14 (never tried previous kernels, sorry), playback on emu10k
works well (modulo infrequent dropouts even on unloaded system), but
recording seems br0ken.
cat /dev/dsp > /tmp/delme followed by 
cat /tmp/delme > /dev/dsp gives *some* noise, but definitely not TV
audio I fed it :-(. Anyone met that problems? Any solutions known?
