My favorite form uses only tabs and would make that look like:
	if(
		get_wq_data(work) == cwq &&
		work_pending(work) &&
		!list_empty(&work->entry)
	) {
		...
		...
	}
Putting the && at the front would be OK with me too, it does make them
more obvious and easier to find.
I don't find too many people who like my style but that's OK.  I think
it makes everything a lot easier to read and everything lines up with
8-space tabs or 2 or 3 space tabs.  Plus, reformatting other people's
code gives me a good chance to read it as I go. :-)
