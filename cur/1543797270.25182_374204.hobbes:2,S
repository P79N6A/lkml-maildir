I completely agree with all your arguments. My point is that your
solution is a long term one. It depends on demand being there, on
hardware vendors to be educated/lobbied/pressured, on both part
vendors and part assemblers to use the logos (as a good side effect
creating the logo might enforce the existance of Linux/Free OS
specialized hardware companies).
This is a good but long term shot. It will take years before such a
framework becomes effective for the user.
For example. If I have to buy a laptop today, I will have a hard time
finding a computer fully supported under Linux using Free drivers.
Let's say that the laptop of my dreams contains a non supported wifi
driver. I already have a supported exteranl Wifi card. In that case,
I'd rather pick the tool almost good for the job that shows me as
profficient under Linux (non certified), than a fully certified laptop
but that doesn't make me as effective.
We probably need both the logo/certification and the centralized
hardware database, but the later might be effective sooner.
