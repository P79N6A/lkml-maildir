Subject: [PATCH] i386: Decouple PAE from CONFIG_CMPXCHG64
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/18/272

Commit 9d9bbd4d247a674deb43565582151acdc22e90d1 makes CONFIG_CMPXCHG64
dependent on CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G, but KVM guest SMP support now also
requires CMPXCHG64 while not being tied to PAE.  So the effect of that patch
is to disable KVM on non-PAE configs.
Untangle those dependencies by:
 - having KVM select CMPXCHG64
 - having HIGHMEM64G select CMPXCHG64_REQUIRED, a variant that also
   checks for the feature at early boot
No processors that support KVM exist that also do not support CMPXCHG64,
so no additional check is necessary.  This setup allows for a single kernel
that will boot on i486 and also support KVM if available.
