I expect so.  I'm in the middle of figuring out how to make kthread_stop
successfully terminate interruptible sleeps, so I can convert the
last hold outs using kernel_thread to kthread.
Which means it will be a day or two before I can look at this, unless
I get lucky and it happens to be a trivial rebase.
