That shouldnt be possible - we are supposed to start at 0x203 and skip the
problem area.
static int isapnp_next_rdp(void)
{
        int rdp = isapnp_rdp;
        while (rdp <= 0x3ff) {
                if (!check_region(rdp, 1)) {
                        isapnp_rdp = rdp;
                        return 0;
            	}
                rdp += RDP_STEP;
                /*
                 *      We cannot use NE2000 probe spaces for ISAPnP or we
                 *      will lock up machines.
                 */
                if(rdp >= 0x280 && rdp <= 0x380)
                        continue;
    	}
        return -1;
}
If you can find out why that port is being touched I'd like to know
