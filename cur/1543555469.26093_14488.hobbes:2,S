ksymoops prints the original data followed by the decode, it is clean.
<rant> klogd only prints the decoded data, often gets it wrong and
leaves garbage for ksymoops.  I did a patch to klogd a couple
of years ago and sent it to the maintainer but neither the sysklogd
maintainer nor the distributors seem to care. </rant>

Take a look at the code in ksymoops oops.c before you make rash
statements like that.  It has to handle _all_ architecture messages,
including cross arch debugging.
