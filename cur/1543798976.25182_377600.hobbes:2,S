mlockall MCL_FUTURE applies to this image only and the 2.6 behaviour is
correct if less useful in some ways. It would be possible to add an
inheriting MCL_ flag that was Linux specific but then how do you control
the depth of inheritance ? If that isn't an issue it looks the easiest.
Another possibility would be pmlockall(pid, flag), but that looks even
more nasty if it races an exec.
