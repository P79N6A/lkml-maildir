It would help a lot of we can determine where the kernel is spending all this
time.  Can you please generate a kernel profile?
Start a large IO operation then, while it is running, run
#!/bin/sh
sudo opcontrol --stop
sudo opcontrol --shutdown
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/oprofile
sudo opcontrol --vmlinux=/boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r)
sudo opcontrol --start-daemon
sudo opcontrol --start
sleep 10
sudo opcontrol --stop
sudo opcontrol --shutdown
sudo opreport -l /boot/vmlinux-$(uname -r) | head -50
(might need some adjustments for distro variation)
Thanks.
