Greetings All,
Do to limits in personal bandwidth and other projects that need to get
done, I can no longer keep up the back port of the ATA code.
Things that are before me are :
	Finish Stablity of 2.4.0
	Finish CASCADE for 2.4.0 and introduction @ ALS
		8 drives per channel, or 16 drives per card.
	Finish ORBS Castlewood for 2.4.0
	Finish ARCO-IDE RAID for 2.4.0
	Finish ONION-BUG fix without TASKFILE IOCTL for 2.4.0
	Parse 48-bit LBA for 2.4.0/2.5.0
	Finish TASKFILE for 2.5.0
	Prep for SerialATA SuperSets for 2.5.0
	Finish Drive Certification Model and test Suite.
	Stop pissing Linus off on a regular basis ;-)
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick

PS.  If you do not get a reply or a late one you now know why.
PS.  If BKZ is up to it, he will begin to handle the back-ports again.
