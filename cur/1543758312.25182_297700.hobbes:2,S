Hi All,
I have a strange problem.
The Audio driver is statically compiled into the kernel.
When I am loading my MMC driver, It is getting Audio Interrupts.
I browsed thru the web and found out it is a bug in the hardware.
The hardware bug is preventing Audio driver and MMC driver work 
simultaneously.
Does any one have a solution Or a Work around to make both the drivers 
work though the audio driver
is statically compiled into the kernel.
Regards,
Krishna Chaitanya
