Ok. Good. It's a small data-set, but the bug made sense, and so did the 
fix.

Yes. That one-liner is bogus. It was a good way to test a hypothesis for
the common case of a filesystem that uses the block_write_full_page thing
(and reiser is one of the few that doesn't), but it wasn't the real fix.
The reiser patch was the real fix for the problem on reiser, but ext3
should have been ok already. It uses (through a lot of other functions)
generic_file_aio_write_nolock() as the real write engine, and that one
calls "commit_write()" with the page lock held.
