Oh man, you rock.  I spent about ten hours last weekend
trying to teach 2-kernel-monte to do this.  But the damn
XT clock refused to deliver interrupts to the secondary
kernel when the primary had local APCI enabled :(
On uniprocessor, you can type `sudo monte /boot/bzImage'
and get to `decompressing linux' in two seconds flat. (Having
journalling filesystems rather helps with this trick). It's
lovely.

Monte just disables all busmastering on the PCI devices...

module_exit() routines for statically-linked drivers often
don't exist - they're in .text.exit.  I guess you can just
move .text.exit out of the /DISCARD/ section in vmlinux.lds.
Also, take a look at user-mode-linux's do_exitcalls()
implementation - there's no clear reason why that shouldn't
be mainstreamed.
It would be convenient to be able to directly boot a bzImage,
but I guess elf is workable.
Great work, and thanks!  I look forward to 2-second SMP
reboots.
