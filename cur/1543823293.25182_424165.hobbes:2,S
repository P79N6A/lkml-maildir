That's odd, I had thought that too.  This is what "zcat /proc/config.gz 
| grep KALL" shows:
CONFIG_KALLSYMS=y
# CONFIG_KALLSYMS_ALL is not set
# CONFIG_KALLSYMS_EXTRA_PASS is not set
I take it my run through ksymoops was of no help in diagnosing the 
problem?  The panic is _always_ in ipt_do_table.

I had initially sent my traces to the Xen guys.  They have not stated it 
is NOT specific to Xen, just that's it's unlikely.  I did not experience 
the problem with kernel 2.6.12, just with 2.6.16 (up to .13 bugfix 
release).  I have completely disabled all support for SCTP 
(protocol/netfilter/conntrack) as I know it is still quite buggy.  I 
know Xen touches the network code a lot, but nothing specific to 
iptables.  I had contacted them twice before LKML as I didn't want to 
post patch specific problems here.  I have no other patches applied 
besides the Xen patch.
My ruleset is pretty bland.  2 rules in the raw table to tell the system 
to only track my forwarded ports, 2 rules in the nat table for 
forwarding (intercepting) 2 ports, and then in the FORWARD tables 2 
rules per VM to just account traffic.
I've CC'ed xen-devel on this in case they can provide some insight.  I 
am not subscribed to LKML so please make sure to reply to me also in 
responses.
Thank you,
Matt Ayres
