Hello!
Actually, no it doesn't seem to help...  the lockup is over both nics,
can't ping lan or internet, even allowin 50-75 ping packets to go out,
none of them are received in either direction, pinging lan or internet
from linux server, or from pinging via win95/98.  However, pinging from
win95 to win 98 box on the lan works, so it's something to do with the
linux box.
TIA
Erik
