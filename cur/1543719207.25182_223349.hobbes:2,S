While segments on x86 are in general to be avoided (aka the 286
segmented memory models) they can be useful for some things in the
kernel.
Here's a couple of examples:
      * dereference gs:0 to get the thread info.  The first element in
        the structure is its linear address (ie usable for being deref'd
        off of DS).
      * use SS to enforce the stack limit.  This way you'd absolutely
        get an exception when there was a stack overflow (underflow). 
        SS gets reloaded on entry into the kernel and on interrupts
        anyway so there really shouldn't be a performance impact.  I
        haven't looked at all the (potential) gcc implications here so
        this one may not be completely doable.
