Why is it so diffucult to understand that /dev/epoll is an "state change" interface.
Even if you add an event at fd insert time this DOES NOT transform /dev/epoll
in a "state monitor" interface.
That means that you can't use code like this :
        if (readable(fd))
                read();
that is common to "state monitor" interfaces.
The code prototype for "state change" interfaces is like :
        while (read() == FAIL)
                wait(READ_EVENT);
Suppose you transform this in a code like this :
int my_smart_read() {
        if (wait(READ_EVENT))
                read();
}
and a packet with 1000 bytes lands onto the terminal.
If you call my_smart_read() and you read 666 bytes the next
time you're going to call my_smart_read() you get stuck.
This coz /dev/epoll catch terminal "state change" events by design.
You could say, "but i want the terminal state to be reported" and
i say "use select()/poll()//dev/poll".

You've to use speculative read()/write() coz these are going to change
( rx buffer empty, tx buffer full ) the state of the terminal without
which you'll never receive nexts state change events.
Please look at the code the uses rt signals and if you don't like it
i guess you'll never love /dev/epoll.
