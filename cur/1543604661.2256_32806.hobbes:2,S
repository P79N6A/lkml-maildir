If a page matters then CONFIG_CRC32=y can always be chosen by the user.
I prefer not to take away choice from the users unnecessarily, in this
case because you (as I read it) find the case of a library module too
ugly to deal with in Config.in language.  This type of case is going to
pop up again and again.  To me for example it seems reasonable to make
bzlib or zlib into a support module, if a similar case arose.
The easy solution to all this is obviously to build crc32 into the
kernel unconditionally, and live with the kernel bloat.  I don't like
kernel bloat, so I prefer the non-easy option.
