All I want to do is order the execution chunks of different 
threads. Taking two snapshots somewhere near the beginning and 
the end of context switching should be good enough.
There's all the scheduler code in between (or at least the context
switch code). I don't think I need to worry about the exact point
during instruction execution.
I don't think it makes sense to try to correlate instructions
from different threads. It would be a wonderful feature to show
a synchronous trace across multiple threads. But that would require
you to measure time for each instruction. I don't think that's
feasible without reducing performance to single stepping;-)

Would jiffies be a metric that works across cpu's?
At the granularity that I want to measure, I guess that accuracy
is not important at all.

I guess I will (have to) drop it if it cannot be used for what I
intended.
thanks and regards,
markus.
