+What:	blkmtd
+When:	April 2006
+Files:	drivers/mtd/devices/blkmtd.c
+Why:	o An alternative exists that hasn't had  bug report for > 1 year.
+	o Most embedded people tend to use ancient kernels with custom patches
+  	  from mtd cvs and elsewhere, so the 1 year warning period neither
+  	  helps nor hurts them too much.
+	o It's in the way of klibc.  The problems caused by pulling blkmtd
+  	  support are fairly low, while the problems caused by delaying klibc
+  	  can be fairly substantial.  At best, this would be a severe burden
+  	  on hpa's time.
