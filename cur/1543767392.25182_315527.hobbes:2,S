I'm not so sure about SUSPEND and HALT being similar.  It might be much faster
to have a routine that ignores slow state changes and goes directly for
stopping device activity.  Still, I'm not entirely decided.  On ACPI systems
SUSPEND should generally work, as it's the intended behavior for S4 which is
basically like S5 in many cases.  However, having a specific HALT message
might allow driver developers to clarify this ambiguity on a per-device basis.
As for FREEZE, it does seem to match with REBOOT well.  But it really depends
on what other things we intend to use FREEZE for (ex. CPUFREQ might require
something slightly different).

I think it's already clear that we need to pass the specific device state.
Also the intended global system state transition might be helpful.
However, at the moment I'm considering using a slightly different API for
these sort of things.  It would include "->prepare_state_change()" and
"->complete_state_change()"  I'll have further justification for these
changes soon, however, I would like to leave the current stuff around also
as it would still be useful for shutdown and reboot, non-PM suspend issues,
and backward compatibilty.
Thanks,
Adam
