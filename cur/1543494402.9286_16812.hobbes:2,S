Some time ago I wrote a quick and dirty design for a zone
allocator. I guess now is the time to dust off the design
(
http://www.nl.linux.org/~riel/zone-alloc.html
) and think
up a good allocator for 2.3 and  beyond.
The discussion should probably be held on the Linux-MM
mailing list. Linux-MM@kvack.org can be subscribed to
by sending a message to majordomo@kvack.org...
