OK, makes sense :)

It all depends on the architecture people are benchmarking
on. I wouldn't be surprised if the benefit was just as large
on some other machines (heavily loaded 8-way 2MB Xeon?) while
it would be very much smaller on other machines.
I'd be very interested in performance measurements with this
patch. This is mainly because I only have a dual cpu pentium
120 to play with, on an Intel Neptune board, no less :((
regards,
Rik
