With a synchronous NFS export, I'd expect the disk throughput
to be lowered to such an extent that VM issues were not
significant in throughput.  But you have been seeing kswapd
problems so hmmm...
Conceivably this is a networking problem, and not an FS/VM
problem.  There were significant changes to the softirq
handling between 2.4.5 and 2.4.10, for example.
Could I suggest that you split these variables apart?  Perform
some comparative FS/VM testing between the kernels, and then
some comparative network testing?
Is it possible to run the SFS clients on the same machine,
over loopback?
