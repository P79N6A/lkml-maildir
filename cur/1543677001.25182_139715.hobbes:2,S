Still, it is local (UNIX) datagram socket and thus the number of
datagrams is the limit, not the number of bytes. And yes, the problem
is present with 1-byte datagrams. And still, the problem is with select()
and not with send*().
It is *not* FIFO/pipe/stream socket etc. And not a UDP/IP socket either.

I think the above covers only stream-based connection establishing.

No. It is just something completely different.
I understand a system can have no such support. But, currently, Linux
has support which is broken.
