Hi,
Sorry to post while Linus is on holidays, but life goes on.
Is there a good reason, or indeed any reason, why epckpt isn't in the kernel 
right now?
For those of you who don't know, it's a checkpoint/restart utility, it's quite 
good, its functionality can't be duplicated in user space, and it has some 
quite useful applications.
Here's a mirror URL:

I'll wait for replies before I suggest a kernel fork.
Colin.
