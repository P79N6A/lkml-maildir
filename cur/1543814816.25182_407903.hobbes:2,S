Am compiling it.  If acpi_in_suspend, I've had it do
return_ACPI_STATUS(AE_BAD_PARAMETER).  Is there a better error code to
use?  I didn't want to use AE_OK, since the caller might think that
the function will be executed eventually, and might do something silly
like wait for it to be executed -- and produce another hang.  I didn't
know, but to be safe I wanted to return an error code.

That's in my lilo.conf so all kernels I test use those options.  I can
send you the dmesgs from the suspends without the ugly hack (and will
send them from the upcoming suspends, with the ugly hack).
