Ok.  So does anyone have any objections if I push the ARM DMA mmap
interface upstream, which consists of:
/**
 * dma_mmap_coherent - map a coherent DMA allocation into user space
 * @dev: valid struct device pointer, or NULL for ISA and EISA-like devices
 * @vma: vm_area_struct describing requested user mapping
 * @cpu_addr: kernel CPU-view address returned from dma_alloc_coherent
 * @handle: device-view address returned from dma_alloc_coherent
 * @size: size of memory originally requested in dma_alloc_coherent
 *
 * Map a coherent DMA buffer previously allocated by dma_alloc_coherent
 * into user space.  The coherent DMA buffer must not be freed by the
 * driver until the user space mapping has been released.
 */
int dma_mmap_coherent(struct device *dev, struct vm_area_struct *vma,
                      void *cpu_addr, dma_addr_t handle, size_t size);
and a similar one for the ARM-specific "write combining" case (for
framebuffers utilising the DMA API)?
This was discussed on linux-arch, and the discussion died while trying
to settle on a suitable interface through apparant lack of interest.
