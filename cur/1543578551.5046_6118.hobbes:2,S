Could people with Athlons please verify that pre3 works for them?
It's basically Andrea's patch, but I moved the FPU save/restore games away
from arch/i386/lib/mmx.c, so that everything is properly done in one place
and others call the appropriate helper functions instead of thinking that
they know how the lazy FP switching is done.
It also makes the fxsr disable act the same way the TSC disable does.
(And yes, I forgot to update the Makefile release number - sue me, I'm
too lazy to upload a new patch with that fixed ;).
