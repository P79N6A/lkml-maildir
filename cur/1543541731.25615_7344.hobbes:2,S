for me (using a 3com 3c575 card) pcmcia networking didn't work at all.
The first issue is:
- the 3c575_cb.o module is gone.
at least till test4, the 3c575_cb.o was a symlink to the 3c90x.o module.
so I tried to add this symlink myself, with partial success. cardmgr now
loads the module as soon as the card is inserted, the driver is loaded,
but the MAC address is ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff and nothing works. You can't even
setup an IP address.
