Okay, I've not looked at the tcpdump output 'cos I'm not a TCP/IP bod, but
this sounds like the website may be behind a broken firewall which is blocking
ICMP_FRAG_NEEDED; can you ping / traceroute them? If not, I'll bet you good
money they employed some loser who configured their router to drop all ICMP.
If this is the case you might be able to get around it by disabling path
MTU discovery, but the correct solution is to contact the administrator of
the site and LART them with something very, very heavy and extremely pointed.
