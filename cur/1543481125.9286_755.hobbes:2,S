Recently(dec.) in WindowsNT magazine comparisons/similarities between
various flavours of unix and nt had come. In the same article Linux was
ignored as enterprise os on account of following kernel 'limitations' :
1. kernel is not preemptive. ie even a higher priority user thread cant
cause another thread to be swapped if the other thread is presently running
in privileged/kernel context.
2. kernel is not reentrant. ie.only one thread in kernel context at a time.
3. kernel is not multi processing in the sense that on multiprocessor
systems it will run on only one cpu at a time.
will somebody can clarify these doubts and version which enabled it to be
otherwise.
