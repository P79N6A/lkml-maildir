GPLONLY is used for symbols that are part of an object rather than core
interface ABI's. Its to help assist in reminding vendors not to accidentally
create derivative works that might be license violations. It doesnt actually
change the rules one iota
And I'd worry a lot more about binary only unmaintainable code than size
