Hi,
Its been a couple years since I released a new copy of the fsfuzzer program. 
During that time I rewrote the test driver from shell script to "C" so that I 
can exercise exact syscalls. The number of file systems supported has been 
increased. They are: cramfs, ext2/3/4, gfs2, iso9660, jffs2, msdos, reiserfs, 
romfs, squashfs, swap, vfat, xfs, and ecryptfs over other file systems.
The latest release can be found here:

If you have any bug reports or patches, please send them my way.
