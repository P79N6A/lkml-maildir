Syntactic indentation vs alignment (including comments after
non-blank, values for struct initialization etc, split lines too).

Actually tabs "should" be used for indentation at start of the
line, then spaces. "Ideally" :-)
I.e., something like
<TAB>	if (cond && (cond2 ||
<TAB>	_____________cond3))
<TAB>	<TAB>	do_something();
Underline = space.
Perhaps some day...

I'm not sure it's practically possible now.

With spaces in place of all tabs.
All tabs converted to spaces = 20% more?
"Alignment" tabs converted to spaces? How cares how much more would it
take if it's the correct thing. Except that it's not very practical at
this point.
