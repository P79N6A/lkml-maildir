Almost exactly what I want, except I'll go for one g450 and two
screens only.  Administrating one home machine is fun, two
less so.  Only one box heathing the room.  Only one
box taking up space.  Less cabling.  
Two persons using a dual is better than two people with two
UP computers, because the power user may use more than one cpu.
