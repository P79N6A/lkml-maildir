Does your "in 2.6" category mean during the 2.6-pre stage?  I doubt James 
Simmons's console layer rewrite would be dropped in between 2.6.3 and 2.6.4.  
It might still go in because it was submitted by deadline and Linus still 
seems to be chewing through the backlog a bit, but that does strike me as 
something that people would want a crack at during the stabilization phase 
(the 2.6-pre kernels).  But I think it has to be before 2.6.0.  (I think.)
Ditto for the IPV6 rewrite, the people who are currently using IPV6 may want a 
bit of warning about it.  (Unless they're going to do a new/old configuration 
option nightmare thing, which seems really unlikely...)

I suspect this got bumped to 2.7, but haven't heard a thing about it from Alan 
or Al.  Again, not a "during 2.6" item (that I know of), but that's just a 
guess.
Of course since it's coming from Al, he may not bother CCing the list and just 
send it straight to Linus.  He's one of the few people who can get away with 
that.  (And vi script patches.  He seems to have a personality that scares 
bugs away...)
