I agree that ..metas is much less likely to cause a namespace collision, 
but I also think that if we called it "john" it would not be a major 
problem, and since the issue is causing us political problems in getting 
into the kernel, "...." is more PR right (as it does not slight Finnish 
women named meta by suggesting they are too obscure to count), and so 
"...." wins.    "...." also has the advantage that it is elegant in 
extending the Unix convention, in that we already have a ".." and a "." 
and hidden files that start with ".".
