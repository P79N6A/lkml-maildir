	Except for many of us (myself included) have been applying the RAID
patches since the 2.2 series began.  This is more than just a hassle since
because the RAID isn't directly in the kernel we don't always see RAID
patches for every kernel release.  Sometimes we can get away w/ just applying
an old patch, but other times this causes problems.

	We hardly need to have limitations put on us from anyone.  Those who
run production systems should have other systems on which they test things
before actually putting them in place.  They should also be watching to see
what others say about particular kernels before using them.  They should
also (scary thought) read the change list, and see what changed, and what
they might need to update.
