Thanks, Ingo.  I've added Nick too (in part because I'm wondering
whether his s390 SPECIAL bit gets destroyed by mprotect and needs
similar attention).

Indeed.

I've tried doing it slightly differently below,
don't know whether you'll consider it an improvement or not.

I believe it has come up from time to time in certain drivers,
but they've worked around it somehow, so it's never got important
enough to handle in the core.  Glad we're getting to do so now.

Maybe say "defect" rather than "hole"?  I stupidly thought for a
while that you were talking about some gap in the address space.

I'll trust you on that end of it, UC_MINUS is beyond me.

(Nothing to do with your patch, but that's a silly line, isn't it?
_PAGE_NX isn't in _PAGE_CHG_MASK so it doesn't need further masking out.)

An odd thing is that you end up keeping the PAT bits from the old
pte, and the PAT bits from vm_page_prot.  So if they can get out
of synch, you'd be oring them together; and if they can't get out
of synch, then do you need a change here?
I've followed that dup in my version below, but it's probably wrong.
Yes, you want the PAT bits in vm_page_prot (so various places
will automatically set them), but I think here it's more correct
to take the PAT bits from the old pte and mask out those from the
vm_page_prot?
I suggest that way round because I'm vaguely anticipating that
silly case of a MAP_PRIVATE mapping of one of these things: we'll
need to add something in do_wp_page so as not to set the PAT bits
on private COWed copies of the PATted page (but that can follow
later as a fixup patch).

I'm thinking its equivalent needs to be in asm/pagetable.h.

I'm not convinced that this anding and oring is necessarily right for
any architecture: I think this function (or my equivalent pgprot_modify)
ought to go down in the arch headers: next to pte_modify helped my focus.

Here's my more minimal alternative; but I think we need to clarify
on that apparent duplication of the PAT bits in pte_modify.
