That's the one.  Your 120GB drives are being seen as UDMA-33.  Whatever is
causing this is slowing you down.  Fix this, and the performance should
improve.

According to your single-drive benchmarks, it didn't do the job.  You'll
have to find the CAUSE of the UDMA-33 identification, and fix it.  An
example (not necessarily your problem) is that if a 40-conductor cable is
used, you CAN'T set the drive to UDMA-66/100/133.  There may also be some
settings in the drive or controller, or some jumpers, that are keeping the
drive from switching to the fast modes.
Once you get the drives being identified at a fast UDMA, you then need to
again verify the array performance.  It should have climbed significantly.
Good luck.
