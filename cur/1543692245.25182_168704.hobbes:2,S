Which has one interesting thing and doesn't have another.
	1) kernel has no idea WTF major 3/minor 2 means.
	2) kernel hadn't even tried to look around for IDE disks
The most likely cause: IDE support is not turned on.  Check your .config -
the interesting parts are CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK.
