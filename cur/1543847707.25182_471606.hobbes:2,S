This is slightly different.  This shows that there are a number of
slightly different kernel implementations:
/proc/acpi/toshiba/lcd
/proc/acpi/asus/brn
/proc/acpi/pcc/brightness
/proc/acpi/ibm/brightness
/proc/acpi/sony/brightness
/proc/omnibook/lcd
which is indeed nasty. I'd agree all in-kernel solutions should use
the same kernel<->user interface.  I'd also expect the kernel to have
a generic ACPI driver that exports the _BCL and _BCM method
implementations via that same interface, so that systems providing
that will "just work".  drivers/acpi/video.c currently exports this
via /proc/acpi/video/$DEVICE/brightness, which isn't the same as
/sys/class/backlight. :-(
There's also at least one more userspace option for the sonypi using
spiictrl.  This is where I expected libsmbios to plug in also, as a
fallback to the ACPI _BCL/_BCM methods above.
Thanks,
Matt
