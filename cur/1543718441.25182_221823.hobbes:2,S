Hi,
Since Fedora Core 2 is out,we all know, that the nvidia kernel module does
not work with 4kstacks. But on my x86-64 the nvidia module also freezes my
system (when starting X) with 2.6.6-bk5 and -bk6. i thought the  4kstack
patch is for i386 only. Are 4kstacks the reason for the freeze also on
x86-64? how can i disable them? (haven't such a option in config).
	thx Thomas
