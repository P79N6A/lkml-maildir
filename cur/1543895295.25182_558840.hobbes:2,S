ok, then you must have CONFIG_AGP=y

That doesn't make much sense.  The hardware doesn't change between
a working & not-working kernel, and somehow the PCI probing fails.
Hmm, do you have CONFIG_EDAC set ?
There's an outstanding bug (well, lack of feature) , where it claims
the PCI device before AGP gets a chance to.
This is unrelated to your hang however, but would at least explain
the inconsistent probing.

It's needed only for 3d, but it'd be good to figure out why its so
broken on your system, even if you don't need it.
