What's happening is:
task 1				task 2
-> sys_open
 -> lock_kernel
  -> testdev_open
   -> test_and_set_bit
     return success
    unlock kernel
				-> sys_open
				 -> lock_kernel (blocks on it)
				  -> testdev_open
				   -> test_and_set_bit
				     return -EBUSY
				    unlock kernel
				   return
   return
The BKL is only held for the duration of the open, not until you close the
device.
