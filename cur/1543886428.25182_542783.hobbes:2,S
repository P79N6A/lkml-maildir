Oh, I am not advocating censorship. I was merely pointing out that it 
seems silly to mention out-of-tree users because they come and go. Who 
knows whether LTTng or SystemTAP will be relevant five years from now? 
Besides, are we sure the document includes all potential users now? We 
wouldn't want to show favorism to any particular projects, now would we?
