[1.] Bug in drivers/char/mem.c
[2.] An if statement (#if !defined) has apparently been left out of 
drivers/char/mem.c. This breaks the build on the m68k architecture.
[3.] Kernel 2.4.1
[4.] Oops: Not applicable
[6.] Try building a kernel on m68k.
[7.] Env: not applicable.
[7.1.] Software (add the output of the ver_linux script here)

[7.7.] Other information that might be relevant to the problem
The error is at line 598. The code normally looks like so:
       {3, "null",    S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO,           &null_fops},
       {4, "port",    S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP, &port_fops},
       {5, "zero",    S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO,           &zero_fops},
I changed it to look like this instead:
       {3, "null",    S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO,           &null_fops},
#if !defined(__mc68000__)
       {4, "port",    S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP, &port_fops},
#endif
       {5, "zero",    S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO,           &zero_fops},
This is probably not the right way to fix this. However, it was the only 
way at my immediate disposal with my limited coding skill[sz]. If 
someone has a better solution, please apply it.
