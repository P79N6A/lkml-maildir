For a big subsystem that exposes an API, you would be right.  But this
is a *really* simple problem, all you need is a way to tell it who gets
RT privileges, which means uid or gid.  So any future solution will be
orthogonal to this one, and when users upgrade even a not very smart
Perl script will be able to migrate the configuration.  How many
different ways are there to say "these are the non-root users who have
realtime prvileges", anyway?
Unless, of course, the solution that's eventually merged is *really*
overcomplicated by comparison, in which case users will (rightly) reject
it, and the system will have worked.
