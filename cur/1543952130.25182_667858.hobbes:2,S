The problem is defining how much "very little" is, and making sure that
all the other kernel developers agree with you on it.
Anyway, I'm sick of too much bitching and too little coding.  Andrew,
here's a patch for -mm that will at least shut up the spinlock warnings.
Al, you'll also need something similar to this for when you get Linus to
pull your git tree that has the r/o bind mount patches. 
It's a hack, but I don't know any better way to do it until the ACPI
mess gets cleaned up.
Arjan, is there a way to statically set lockdep classes for a spinlock
that I'm missing?
I'll leave it to everyone else to describe the evils of calling into
*any* fs code before the fs initcalls have been made. 
-- Dave
I'm not happy with this patch, but I don't see an easier way
to do it.  We can't statically initialize the lockdep classes
as far as I can see.
