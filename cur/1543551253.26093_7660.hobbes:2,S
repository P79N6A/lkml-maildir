Forget about them. It was my non-understanding of __builtin_constant_p()
that was causing me the problem. I fixed a few >20000 udelay's (replacing
them with mdelay) in some PPC specific code. I'll send you some patches
later, I have to extract them from my tree. Well... would you accept a
huge pile of PPC patches for 2.2.18 in this case, I can send you my
current diffs (with a bit of cleanup) ?
Those contain almost only pmac-specific stuffs (support for new machines,
sleep fixes, and a few more fixes here or there).
Ben.
