In this case, it appears that the lowered priority was causing 
trouble.  One test run isn't enough to say 100%, but what I read out of the 
numbers is that at least kswapd needs to be able to preempt.
wrt the uncontrolled unfairness, I've muttered about this before.  I've 
also tried (quite) a few things, but nothing yet has been good enough to... 
require trashing that I couldn't do here ;-)
