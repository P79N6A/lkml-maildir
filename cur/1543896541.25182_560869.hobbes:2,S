I suspect that would tend to be a good way to go. But it almost certainly 
has to be per-device, which implies that somebody would have to do some 
major coding/testing on this..
The vm_dirty_ratio thing is a global value, and I think we need that 
regardless (for the independent issue of memory deadlocks etc), but if we 
*additionally* had a per-device throttle that was based on some kind of 
adaptive thing, we could probably raise the global (hard) vm_dirty_ratio a 
lot.
