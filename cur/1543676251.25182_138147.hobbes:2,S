           Summary: vesafb fails to initalize 1GB system memory and 128MB
                    video memory
    Kernel Version: 2.5.63 - Current
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: jsimmons@infradead.org
         Submitter: crude@copymat.net
                CC: crude@copymat.net
Distribution: 
Gentoo Linux 1.4 profile w/ ARCH=~x86 
Hardware Environment: 
2xAthlon MP 1900+,Tyan 2462 (AMD 760MP), 1GB memory, VisionTek Gforce 4 Ti4600(128 
MB) 
Software Environment: 
GCC 3.2.3, Glibc 2.3.2 
Problem Description: 
trying to use vesafb, and get blank screen (system boots normaly w/ exception of no 
frambuffer) has something to do with failing to allopcate memory (ioremap i belive) this had 
been present in 2.4 series as well, untill recently (at least in the ac sources, and 
gentoo-sources) 
Steps to reproduce: install 1GB of memory, and use a video card w/ 128MB memory and try 
to use frambuffered console (I have seen behaviour on more than just my card. 
I have ported the patch that I had used in the 2.4 series (before gentoo and ac picked it up) 
please be kind as I am relativly new to this, and I hope this helps (btw I have been using this 
patch since 2.5.63, w/ slight change at 2.5.67, on linus's kernel and on the mm tree, and have 
had no troubles)

please let me know what I can do better to make this easier on you.... 
Thanks for all your hard work, the 2.6 kernel is going to turn a lot of heads, been nothing but 
impressed with the developmental branch
