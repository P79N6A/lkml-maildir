That depends.. do you want the thing to look like a file or a directory?
If it's a document _represented_ as a directory, surely you want it to
appear as a file in listings?  So `ls document' will show one entry, not
the components of the document.
If you want it to look like a directory to ls, no problem.
readdir() will work as usual.
BTW my `ls /etc' opens "/etc" not "/etc/" -- the latter follows symbolic
links.  Even if you say `ls -l /etc/' (though that's a GNU-ism).
