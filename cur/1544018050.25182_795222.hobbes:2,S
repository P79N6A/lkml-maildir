What is more concerning is that the change that introduced this:
commit 58c6d3dfe436eb8cfb451981d8fdc9044eaf42da
Author: Johannes Weiner <hannes@cmpxchg.org>

    dma-coherent: catch oversized requests to dma_alloc_from_coherent()
    Prevent passing an order to bitmap_find_free_region() that is larger than
    the actual bitmap can represent.
    These requests can come from device drivers that have no idea how big the
    dma region is and need to rely on dma_alloc_from_coherent() to sort it out
    for them.

Claims to fix a problem that doesn't exist anywhere in-tree today, and was
obviously never tested. This looks like a sanity thing for drivers that derive
their coherent pool from passed in platform device resources.
It is equally impressive that the author of this patch modified a code path
that is only hit by platforms that provide dma_declare_coherent_memory() (sh,
arm, mips, and x86_32) and subsequently failed to Cc the primary users of the
interface.
I'll add your patch to my queue and send it off to Linus later today, thanks.
