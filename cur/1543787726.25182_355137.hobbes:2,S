Here is the more than weekly error report about our usenetgateway.
2.6.12-mm1 keeps running for weeks.
2.6.1[34] keeps crashing within days
Hardware isn't the problem, software is (my guess is acpi/irq)
ethernet is doing >200megabit/s average on 2 cards simultanious.
hardware:
tyan amd64 - opteron 250 (dual cpu, but UP kernel)
4Gig ram
dual scsi controller
8 x scsi disks
acenic gig-E (FO)
onboard gig-E (cupper)
software:
debian-pure64 amd

Currently trying 2.6.14-rc2-mm2.
When that fails i will try rc3-git[latest]
Let me know when someone wants to have more info or a test
setup.
