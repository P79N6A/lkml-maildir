	Huh? I am saying the policy can be anything at all. We could just go with
"whoever asks first", but we are not required to. And, in any event, I meant
whoever asks for the mutex first, not whoever blocks first. (Note that I
didn't say "whoever asked first" which would mean something totally
different.)

	The spec says that the decision is triggered by a particular condition that
exists at the time of the unlock. That does not mean the decision is made at
the time of the unlock.

	We don't agree on what the specification says.

	Why do I suppose what? I find the specification perfectly clear and your
reading of it incredibly strained for the three reasons I stated.

	I don't think it's unclear.
