Thanks a lot, David. We will try to cleanup the code and most issues
pointed out in your review.

Yes, I sent out a coding style incremental patch appending in -mm tree.
Should I send out a new patch including the coding style clean up and
code updated according to this review, or still submit incremental
patches to Andrew?

Got it, it should be followed.

Yes, we are trying to use kernel generic BUG_ON and WARN_ON to replace
our own assert function. I fixed this in other code and obviously it was
missed in this driver patch.

Apparently, the driver author Luke wrote this driver based on
drivers/spi/pxa2xx_spi.c. These things are all from pxa2xx_spi.c driver.
I will update our driver according to your comments.

You are right. It should be fixed up

Copy that from pxa2xx_spi.c, sorry.
And your comments are very valuable, we will update this driver ASAP.
Thanks again
