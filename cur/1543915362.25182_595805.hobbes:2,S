Hi Miles,
The problem appears to be that ACPI_AC is compiled in but POWER_SUPPLY is
a module. You could workaround it by making them both modules but I believe
the root cause may be a dependency problem. I've included a patch below that
when you apply and run make oldconfig should allow you to build your kernel.
ACPI folks, is this a fix? If so, there may be other dependency issues that
allow a compiled-in feature to depend on a module.
