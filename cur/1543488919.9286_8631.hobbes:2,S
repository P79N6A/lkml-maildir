Hogwash! I'm the Network Eng. at the county offices in Martin County
Florida. We not only have gigabit ethernet in our (sun) servers, but use
it for connecting remote sites!
Yes, the workstations are still connected via switched 100Mb/s.. But
gigabit ethernet works and will be commidity someday soon (5 years sounds
good).. However, switched 100Mb/s has a bandwidth of 20MB/s (full duplex).
Btw- 100Mb/s has better latency then 2ms! I imagine that if you had a MPI
implimentation that banged the hardware correctly (or a speical network
API for doing zero copy for MPI and such) you could get 1/4 or less that
latency.

Okay, cant argue there.

So? You have failed to show that slow networking makes clustering
worthless.
Consider, the Avalon which is interconnected with switched 100Mb/s
achieved enough performance (after a memory upgrade) to reach the 50th
fastest computer in the world at a total price of around what? $280K?
Even on REAL (and network smashing) code (spasm and grav tree code) they
got better price/performance then out of real supercomputers.
The nodes were 21164a's with more memory bandwidth then your 100MHz
example (66Mhz SDRAM/ 128Bit bus). Yes, the network was slow, and even
though it slaughtered performance (1 node performance * n nodes, was
something like 10 times better for some codes), clustering was still worth
while.

And then there is reality: Faster chips and 'real supercomputers' will
always cost so much more then commodity supercomputers that clustering
will be worthwhile long into the future.

Think different.
