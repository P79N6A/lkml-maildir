Is this really true?  Is tasklet scheduling "harder" than kernal thread
scheduling?  A close look at my PXA SSP SPI implementation will reveal
that my design is nearly lock-less and callable from any execution
context (i.e. interrupt context).
In general, the "pump_transfer" and "pump_message" tasklets should
mutually exclusive (anything else is a programming
mistake). I certainly could collapse the tasklets into a single one if
you think this would be better?

This can not be invoke this from "interrupt context" which is a
requirement for my SPI devices (CS8415A, CS8405A, CS4341).
