From what I have read, CDDL is treading the veeeerrrrrry thin line between 
an actual Free license and an actual proprietary licence. Just look at the 
nonsense Mozilla Co. has gotten itself worked up about (and judging by how 
much Firefox/Iceweasel crashes on me, being like IE is quite appropriate 
in licencing too). And (if I have not been misinformed), CDDL is inspired 
by Mozilla's licence.
The FSF has something to say.

So yes, CDDL is, to me, "pseudo-"proprietary, and it would be very easy 
for them to slip up and whoops! Didn't we tell you? You can do everything 
but -that-. But of course it's still free...yeah...

The GPL is more about protection than openness. Someone can write code, 
throw it on the internet with no licence at all, and it's exactly as 
"open" as it is under the GPL. You can do anything you want with it in any 
way, just like under the GPL. What the GPL does is protect the code and 
its writer from being snapped up by somebody else, and in any way 
restricted: It makes sure the code STAYS open, and makes sure you are 
always free to do as you like with it.
