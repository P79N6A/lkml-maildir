Yeah, I've been reading that.  But what if it's fixed in 2.2.1?  This is really a
judgment call -- include only things that are 100%, or include stuff that's almost
there.  I'm not sure what the proper answer here is.

How about "portions of BSD UNIX"?
If BSD licenses the UNIX trademark, then it really is BSD UNIX, so as long as we
credit the trademark properly, this is not a problem.  The problem is referring to
Linux -- not a licensor of the UNIX trademark -- as UNIX.
