As far as the Intel CPU is concerned, it is not particularly hard.  The
real problem as far as Linux itself is concerned is twofold: first, it
requires contiguous 4MB pages, and secondly Linux assumes a uniform,
fixed-depth page table hierarchy.  It is really not set up for looking
at ptes inside the page directory, although with a bit of tweaking it
would be possible to repeat the pmd folding trick and make the 4MB pte
appear as a single-entry page table.
