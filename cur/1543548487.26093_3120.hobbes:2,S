rsync will transfer a bunch of file modification times and, where they
don't match, a bunch of checksums.  This is still a few bytes of state
for every file.
The obvious extension to rsync would be to make the rolling checksum
hierarchical -- successively approximating smaller and smaller regions,
and treating the whole set of files as a single data stream for the
algorithm.  "Null update" would then always reduce to transferring a
single cryptographic-level checksum -- better than 6K and still works if
you lose the Changeset file. :-)

Yes that's a good thing.
