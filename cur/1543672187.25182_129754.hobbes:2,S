If there was numerous issues, sure. But every time we get to the point
where it seem that that is necessary we find a workaround. 
Right now, this is the ONLY issue we got..

IN general LD_PRELOAD is fun for testing and academic programs, but not
for production code. 
In specific you run into a problem with how fortran 90 compilers do
dynamical arrays. It's very compiler dependent.

Nope. The drivers test to see if the page is DMAable, and do a copy if
necessary. Most of the high performance interconnects NIC's do 64 bit
PCI.

No! I don't disagree with removing the export of the syscall_table!
I just want the "proper mechanism" indicated by Arjan in the changelog.
Pls read this thread. There are legitimate uses to having syscall
hooks/notifications, either you think mine is or not.
