#define SNAPSHOT_ATOMIC_SNAPSHOT	_IOW(SNAPSHOT_IOC_MAGIC, 3, void *)
#define SNAPSHOT_SET_IMAGE_SIZE		_IOW(SNAPSHOT_IOC_MAGIC, 6, unsigned long)
#define SNAPSHOT_AVAIL_SWAP		_IOR(SNAPSHOT_IOC_MAGIC, 7, void *)
#define SNAPSHOT_GET_SWAP_PAGE		_IOR(SNAPSHOT_IOC_MAGIC, 8, void *)
#define SNAPSHOT_SET_SWAP_FILE		_IOW(SNAPSHOT_IOC_MAGIC, 10, unsigned int)
#define SNAPSHOT_PMOPS			_IOW(SNAPSHOT_IOC_MAGIC, 12, unsigned int)
Are these a problem? Do we need to just use u32 as a argument to keep
ioctl numbers same between 32 and 64bit versions?
