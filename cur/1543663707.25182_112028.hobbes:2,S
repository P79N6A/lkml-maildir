Okay, cool.  My cursory browsing of drivers/base/core.c missed this,
my apologies.

Your previous example wouldn't, but depending on how the BIOS assigns bus 
numbers at boot time, I could see some docking station hardware suffering 
from the problems I see on cPCI.  For example, if the BIOS does not leave 
a hole in the bus numbers for the docking station's bridge, and there 
happens to be another bridge on the laptop, then you would have the same 
overlapping range problem after docking that I see after hot-inserting a 
peripheral card with a bridge.

I suspect I'm going to have to try and find out sooner or later, as all of 
the x86 based cPCI system boards that I've seen use either Phoenix or 
Award BIOSes that started their lives in desktop PCs.
