As a C-function or as a debugfs file?
Are we controlling an action (recording events), a feature (a buffer
where to record) or an implementation (a ring buffer)?
Does the user know or care if it is a ring buffer or just whatever
temporary storage?
What does the user actually want to control? A buffer? A ring
buffer? Recording stuff? The tracer? Tracing? Data flow?
Assuming there are also other users than tracing, does it make
sense to control the ring buffer facility itself?
I'm sure we could discuss this forever, so I'll just say:
Happy new year! :-)
