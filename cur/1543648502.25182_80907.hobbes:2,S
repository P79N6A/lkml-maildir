Linus (marcello too),
	please please please please apply George's patches.
	increasing HZ to 1000 is a painful hack that hurts us all in excange for a 
very small benefit to a very limited set of services.
	George's solution provides high res timers for those services and users that 
want it without penalizing those who don't.
	please please please.
	if nothing else, put it in with default config to off.
