This is the start of the stable review cycle for the 2.6.18.1 release.
There are 67 patches in this series, all will be posted as a response to
this one.  If anyone has any issues with these being applied, please let
us know.  If anyone is a maintainer of the proper subsystem, and wants
to add a Signed-off-by: line to the patch, please respond with it.
These patches are sent out with a number of different people on the Cc:
line.  If you wish to be a reviewer, please email stable@kernel.org to
add your name to the list.  If you want to be off the reviewer list,
also email us.
Responses should be made by Friday, October 13, 20:00:00 UTC.  Anything
received after that time might be too late.
And yes, we realize that this is a large number of patches, sorry, we
have been a bit slow in responding lately.  If there are any patches
that have been sent to us for the 2.6.18-stable tree, that are not in
this series, please resend them, as we think we are finally caught up
with this work.
An all-in-one patch for this series can be found at:
