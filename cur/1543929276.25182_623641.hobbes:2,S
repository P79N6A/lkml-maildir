I used BEA Jrockit to run volanoMark. Because of no Jrockit source codes, so
I retested volanoMark by jre-1.7.0-icedtea.x86_64 java of Fedora Core 8 on my stoakley (8-core)
machine with kernel 2.6.24-rc3.
1) Jrockit: sched_compat_yield=0's result is less than 15% of sched_compat_yield=1's.
2) jre-1.7.0-icedtea: sched_compat_yield=0's result is less than 89% of sched_compat_yield=1's.
So JVM really has much impact on the regression.
I checked the source codes of openjdk and found Thread.yield is implemented as native sched_yield.
If java applications call Thread.yield, it just calls sched_yield. garbage collection and other JVM
threads also calls Thread.yield. That's why 2 different JVM have different regression percentage.
Although no source codes of volanoMark, I suspect it calls Thread.sched. volanoMark is a kind
of chatroom benchmark. When a client sends out a message, server will send the message to all clients.
I suspect the client calls Thread.yield after sending out a couple of messages.
2 JVM all have regression if sched_compat_yield=0.
I ran some testing, such like iozone/specjbb/tbench/dbench/sysbench, and didn't see regression.
