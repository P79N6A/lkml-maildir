I just found a machine which will resume after suspend to memory, using 
the mainline kernel (no suspend2 patch).
On resume I was looking at the uptime output, and it was about six 
minutes, FAR longer than the time since resume. So the topic for 
discussion is, should the uptime be
 - time sine the original boot
 - total uptime since first boot, not counting the time suspended
 - time since resume
 - some other time around six minutes
Any of the first three could be useful and "right" for some casesm thus 
discussion invited.
