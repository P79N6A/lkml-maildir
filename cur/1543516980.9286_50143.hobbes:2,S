Hello, 
I recently got a dual pIII machine and can't get Linux to work well on
it. With kernel 2.2.13-14pre apt-get says 'Bad file descriptor' for
almost every file it tries to download. If I try to track the problem
with strace, it downloads all files perfectly.
Then I tried to switch to 2.3.29. apt-get works well, but if I try to
start gvim on a remote machine via ssh X11 forward, X locks up and
read operations on the /proc entry of some process (I can't read the
/proc entry to know which one) locks too. I can log on remotely but
cannot kill X, and after some time all processes stop. The kernel is
still running, it accepts TCP connections, but the process listening
can't answer them.
With one CPU removed, 2.2.13-14pre works perfectly. I haven't tried
2.3.29 with 1 cpu yet.
I also couldn't find any info in the last ~2000 messages on lk that
would help me. 
Is it a known problem, am I using the wrong kernel / hardware / etc?
I'm willing to give any information I can but please ask, because I
don't want to take the machine apart unless necessary.
TIA
