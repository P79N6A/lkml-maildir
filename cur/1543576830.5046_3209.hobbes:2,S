Looks good.
There's a few things this misses, the worst of which were all my bugs in
the original description.  Things like "don't unlock the page after
calling writepage, becasue writepage will do it on its own".  Details
like that. 
The worst problem actually ends up being the fact that the global sync()
doesn't work, after all, because if it's associated with syncing the
inodes it will only sync the dirty page list for inodes that are dirty. 
Now, this probably doesn't show up in testing, because mostly if you
have dirty pages the inode too _will_ be dirty, but that only makes the
bug more insidious. 
So I'll work on this a bit to polish up these problems, but on the whole
this is all fine.
