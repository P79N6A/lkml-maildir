The future is in higher and higher SMP counts since the chase for the
higher clock frequency has ended. We will increasingly see multi-core
cpus etc. Machines with higher CPU counts are becoming common in business.
Of course SGI uses much higher CPU counts and our supercomputer
applications would benefit most from this patch.
I thought this patch was already approved by Linus?

Here is a measurement of 256M allocation on a 2 way SMP machine 2x
PIII-500Mhz:
 Gb Rep Threads   User      System     Wall flt/cpu/s fault/wsec
  0  10    1    0.005s      0.016s   0.002s 54357.280  52261.895
  0  10    2    0.008s      0.019s   0.002s 43112.368  42463.566
With patch:
 Gb Rep Threads   User      System     Wall flt/cpu/s fault/wsec
  0  10    1    0.005s      0.016s   0.002s 54357.280  53439.357
  0  10    2    0.008s      0.018s   0.002s 44650.831  44202.412
So only a very minor improvements for old machines (this one from ~ 98).
