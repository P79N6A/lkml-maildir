Fortunately I don't mind trolls. I don't think I have _ever_ seen
a compound document represented as a directory. I know that TeX
users do it sometimes, but they aren't normal users anyway.
Ask a random MBA, art student, or secretary what "TeX" is.
Normal users don't write Makefiles for their documents.
Every directory-based document system has failed for general use.
Directories are containers or "folders", distinct from documents.
Attempts to hide this in a GUI will always fail.
