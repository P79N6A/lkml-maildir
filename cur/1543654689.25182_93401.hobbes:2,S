"en" is script changing locale to en_US so that you see message in
English.
auto.master:
# $Id: auto.master,v 1.2 1997/10/06 21:52:03 hpa Exp $
# Sample auto.master file
# Format of this file:
# mountpoint map options
# For details of the format look at autofs(8).
/misc	/etc/auto.misc	--timeout=60
Just tested that the system hangs when the autofs4 module is in use.
autofs (without 4) module does not cause any problems.
What is characteristic is that before the system hangs I get numerous
messages reading `invalid seek on drive /dev/hdc' on my virtual console.
