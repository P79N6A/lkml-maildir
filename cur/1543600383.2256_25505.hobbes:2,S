based on size in turn means based on source because the kiobuf has a
fixed size. This is why I'm saying it has to be vmalloced in these
kernel trees until we shrink it and the plan to shrink it is first of
all to split the io backend out of the memory management part.

btw, I actually don't have the workload here (my software simulations says
it works but it's not exactly the same workload, the workload I
simulated to test it is pure simultaneous rawio I/O load to the same
rawio device via different filp) so I'd like to know too ;)
