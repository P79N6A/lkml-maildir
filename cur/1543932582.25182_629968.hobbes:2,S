ok, I'll re-work the patch according to your sample and re-submit.
The debugging was needed during development, and might still be needed
to debug some weird issues.
btw: OpenMoko is currently working on an ar6k wifi driver on top of the 
new mainline kernel SDIO support using the s3c_mci host controller
driver as basis.  So within not-too-distant-time we should also be able
to have SDIO working and tested on s3c_mci.
