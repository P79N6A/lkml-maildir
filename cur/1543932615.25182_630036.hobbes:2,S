Two questions:
1 - what is the memory use impact on the system which don't do swap over 
NFS, such as embedded systems, and
2 - what is the advantage of this code over the two existing network 
swap approaches, swapping to NFS mounted file and swap to NBD device?
I've used the NFS file when a program was running out of memory and that 
seemed to work, people in UNYUUG have reported that the nbd swap works, 
so what's better here?
