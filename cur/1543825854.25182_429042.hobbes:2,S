Just from the program. Since the software depth matched the software
depth, I'd be surprised if it made much of a difference here.  I can
rerun the same test tomorrow with the drive depth modified the and
software depth fixed at 32. Then the io scheduler can at least help the
drive without NCQ out somewhat.
