Just a note however... this patch did fix the problem we were seeing
with retransmits and Win95 compressed PPP and dialup over earthlink in
the bay area.
Now, if it didn't have the side effect of dropping packets left and
right after ~4000 open connections (simultaneously), I could finally
move our production system to 2.4.x.
