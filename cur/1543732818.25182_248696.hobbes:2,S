I just tried the following two things:
Boot option "acpi=off" (made the cusour switching faster on and off). And when
it came to ide setup i get lots of "hda lost interrupt". The system is
unbootable with that option.
With boot option "noapic" there are no more APIC error messages. Should i add
that boot option to my defaults in /etc/lilo.conf?
