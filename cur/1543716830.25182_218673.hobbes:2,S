Subject: [ANNOUNCEMENT PATCH COW] proof of concept impementation of cowlinks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Couldn't sleep last night and finished a first complete version of
cowlinks, code-named MAD COW.  It is still based on the stupid old
design with a flag to distinguish between regular hard links and
cowlinks.  Please don't comment on that design, it's just a proof of
concept.
Patches are against 2.6.5 but most things should apply to other 2.6
kernel without too much trouble.
1 generic_sendpage	- allow sendfile with ext[23] files as target
2 sendfile		- introduce vfs_sendfile for in-kernel use
3 copyfile		- new copyfile() system call
4 lock_flags		- old cruft, just ignore it
5 madcow		- the MAD COW itself
Patches 1-3 will stay, 4 will be remove and 5 replaced by a better
design over time.  I've also set up a webpage for it:
http://wohnheim.fh-wedel.de/~joern/cowlink/
Maybe that should be converted into a wiki so someone with better
taste than myself can improve it.
