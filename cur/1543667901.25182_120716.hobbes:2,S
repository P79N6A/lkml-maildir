My perl-incantation wizard friend (I consider myself mere journeyman)
uses usually convoluted  'map'  constructs to do things like this.
It is amazing high-power way to make things -- and often helps you to
make "write only" script.
Wrapping converter regular expressions into map {} structure gives
something like:
   @summary = map {
	   s/torvalds\@.*transmeta.com/Linus Torvalds/,
	   s/alan\@.*swansea.linux.org.uk/Alan Cox/,
	   ... etc ...
	   1
	} @summary;
See "man perlfunc"  and look for " map ".
