AFAIK
user_xattr - turns on POSIX Extended attributes
nouser_xattr - obvious
acl - turns on ACL (Access Control Lists)
noacl - obvious
However these features are only present in 2.6.x, they are explained in 
Help during kernel configuration. I'm not sure if acl requires user_xattr 
to be turned on. I remember that I spent some time looking for a way to 
enable these on ext2/ext3 :)
