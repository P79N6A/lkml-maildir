You quoted my answer. Use the page allocator to allocate data that has an 
alignment requirement on a 4k boundary.

I still think that the semantics are weird because it only works sometimes 
and then performs an alignment within a cacheline that improves the 
situation somewhat in some cases but does not give the user what he 
expected.
