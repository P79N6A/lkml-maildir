- I think sysctlfs makes sense.
- I think all that is left is superblock handling and some backward
  compatibility magic. (Using the follow_link trick to automatically
  mount /proc/sys)
All of the rest of the code pretty much lives in fs/proc/proc_sysctl.c
already.
I have some other priorities to deal with first but if no one does the
work before I get there I will probably implement that eventually.
