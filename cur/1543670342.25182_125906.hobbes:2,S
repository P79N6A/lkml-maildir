Hello,
    Adding to my previous message, i reran the kernel configuration. I
ensured that the keyboard, mouse, and display settings were set right, and
that my processor and loadable module settings are also right. The only
thing i added was framebuffer console support, but that didn't make a
difference, after it hit the initrd it just hung. Any ideas?
Thanks.
Dave.
