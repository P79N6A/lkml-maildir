Yes, I'm referring to the difficulties of getting this right when
doing online (mounted) resizing, as that was the context of the
original bug report.
Clearly the right thing for resize2fs to do when it's doing an
off-line resize is to just adjust the journal inode and make it
bigger.  I'll add that to my todo list, but of course, patches to do
that would be gratefully accepted...
