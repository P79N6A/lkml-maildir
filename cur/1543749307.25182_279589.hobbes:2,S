The problem is that "most" code believes jiffies is right.  Under long interrupt 
off times, it is not.  I suspect that most of the early timers came from code 
that set the timer with the interrupt system off.  Some might say they got what 
they deserved :).
In the HRT patch, we always correct jiffies to the real value (by marking the 
TSC value at the last jiffie push and using that plus the current TSC to 
correct).  It would be rather easy to provide an interface to get the current 
real current jiffie, but it is another thing to correct all the code that uses 
jiffie.  Attempts to make jiffie a macro pick up far too many uses of the word 
in several name spaces to make it a reasonable thing to do.
