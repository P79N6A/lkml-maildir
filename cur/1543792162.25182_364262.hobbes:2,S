I notice that arch/v850/kernel/irq.c has been updated with a
"show_interrupts" function; in this function it contains the following
bit of code:
	if (i == 0) {
		seq_puts(p, "           ");
		for (i=0; i < 1 /*smp_num_cpus*/; i++)
			seq_printf(p, "CPU%d       ", i);
		seq_putc(p, '\n');
	}
	if (i < NR_IRQS) {
                ... show interrupt i ...
	} else if (i == NR_IRQS)
		seq_printf(p, "ERR: %10lu\n", irq_err_count);
where "i" is iterated (by procfs) from 0...NR_IRQS.
On the v850, irq 0 is a real interrupt, so this doesn't really work
properly -- it doesn't display an entry for irq 0.
Is it now illegal for irq 0 to be a real interrupt (was it illegal before)?
Or is the procfs code just bogus?
Thanks,
