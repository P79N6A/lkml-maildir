I don't care about any overhead associated with stuck processes, nor do I 
care that they look ugly in the ps output.  What I care about is the fact 
that at least once a week on multiple systems with different hardware, some 
HW-related driver/process gets stuck, then immediately cascades its 
stuckness up to udevd or hald, and then I can't use any of my hardware 
anymore until I reboot.
