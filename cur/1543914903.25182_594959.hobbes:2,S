How probable is it that the dentry is needed again? If you copy it and
it is not needed then you wasted time. If you throw it out and it is
needed then you wasted time too. Depending on the probability one of
the two is cheaper overall. Idealy I would throw away dentries that
haven't been accessed recently and copy recently used ones.
How much of a systems ram is spend on dentires? How much on task
structures? Does anyone have some stats on that? If it is <10% of the
total ram combined then I don't see much point in moving them. Just
keep them out of the way of users memory so the buddy system can work
effectively.
