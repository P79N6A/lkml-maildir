That would probably be a good thing. Would you really trust Windows to
ignore the partition completely? I think recent versions of 9x will create
recycle bins on all partitions whether you want them or not.
And would you trust scandisk and it's ilk when they decide to check all
vfat partitions ? I certainly wouldn't. No, please. Forget this horrible
idea!
