Hi,
If you're also running into glibc's tst-robust1 test suite test
locking up your ARM machine, you're probably running into the fact
that asm-arm/futex.h includes asm-generic/futex.h, and
asm-generic/futex.h defines futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() to
return -ENOSYS.  This causes handle_futex_death() to loop forever.
cheers,
Lennert
