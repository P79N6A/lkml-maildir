Yes.  Sharing allows this to happen in a 'safe' way.  The daemon doesn't
have to know how many instances of '/home' exist.

No.  I want to allow the mount.  However, if there are several shared
'/home' (through CLONE_NS or mount --bind), there remains the following
two key problems:
- - How do you expire the mounts and umount them?  (undefined with shared
subtrees thus far)
- - How do you handle the case where '/home/mikew' is automounted in all
instances of it, and then umounted in a single namespace.  Walking back
into '/home/mikew' in that namespace will trigger the daemon to mount
again, but the filesystem is already mounted in it's namespace.
I guess a solution to ponder is what if we included the following rule:
"An attempt to umount a vfsmount X will induce the umounting of all
vfsmounts in X's p-node as well as all vfsmounts/p-nodes 'owned' by said
p-node."
I'm not sure that is a desirable solution or even nice to implement.
