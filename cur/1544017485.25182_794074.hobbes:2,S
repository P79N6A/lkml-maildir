I forgot to mention, looking back I see that once the link disappeared 
(while the cable was still plugged in) on the router but partially came 
back (the the link reappears but the router doesn't serve DHCP leases 
or seemingly route packets) booting new kernels from cold would 
show the problem while network manager was trying to obtain a 
DHCP lease.
I will test your patch the next time that this happens (but this may be 
a while).
