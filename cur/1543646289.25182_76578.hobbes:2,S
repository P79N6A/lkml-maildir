- virt_to_bus(((struct scatterlist *)cmd->buffer)[i].address) :
+ virt_to_bus(
+ page_address(((struct scatterlist *)cmd->buffer)[i].page) +
+ ((struct scatterlist *)cmd->buffer)[i].offset ) :
             virt_to_bus(cmd->request_buffer);
have you actually read Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt?  It says quite plainly:
Drivers converted fully to this interface should not use virt_to_bus any
longer, nor should they use bus_to_virt. 
[...]
It is planned to completely remove virt_to_bus() and bus_to_virt() as
they are entirely deprecated.
So, your patch is quite insufficient.
