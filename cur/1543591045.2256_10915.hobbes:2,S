eject(1), for one thing. And yes, it's ugly beyond belief - don't read

Well, yes, if you can extract fs type from fstatfs() output. I don't
think that ->s_magic (i.e. ->f_type) is a good way to do that, though.
We have unused space in struct statfs and IMO putting the name there
is a good idea. Has an additional nice property of killing the crap
like switch by magic numbers.
