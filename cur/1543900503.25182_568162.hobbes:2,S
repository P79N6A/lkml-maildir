Linus has decreed the evil of typedefs in the kernel, and the DRM is
the proud winner of the "HEY MA: I CAN USE TYPEDEF" award,
So I've cleaned up most of the typedefs in the Linux drm core (I did
this in the kernel tree as I'd like to push it there first and
backport it to the hell of the DRM git tree :-)
http://master.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/airlied/drm-2.6.git;a=shortlog;h=drm-mm
Is my tree so far, with the core typedefs removed, the drivers have a
bunch more.
One thing is a lot of these have been used in userspace so are part of
the API, I've left these in the header surrounded by #ifndef
__KERNEL__ so I can keep them synced easily with the other users..
I think I should get this upstream in this merge window as it'll
probably bust a few patches from other places..
Dave.
