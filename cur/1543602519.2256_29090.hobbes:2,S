The same here. However I've just discovered a workaround for this problem:
The NIC and my SB Live! soundcard shares the same IRQ. If I tried to configure
the NIC before the soundcard I got the message I've described. But if I
configured soundcard first and then NIC, it worked without any problem.
However it's only a workaround and this problem should be fixed. IMHO.
