I definitely wouldn't describe this as a coherency issue--the lines involved 
in the DMA writes are fully coherent.  It's really an ordering problem, and 
the new API is setting a "barrier" bit in the DMA address that indicates to 
the bridge that any outstanding DMA should be written before the barriered 
data.  So calling it set_flush or set_barrier is fine with me...
