At least one.  I have three machines that still run a fair number of a.out
binaries.  Some of them I simply haven't yet bothered to update since they
still work, and some I haven't found source for yet.  But I'm on your side
to the extent that I know they're there and I intend to rebuild them all 
as ELF at some point.  I don't prefer a.out binaries, I just have 'em.

Please, no more software products offering a "richer experience"!  I have
indigestion of the brain already.  Give me a more ascetic experience.
