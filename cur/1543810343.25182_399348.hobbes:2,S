Yes, only on vSMPowered systems.  Well, we have a large 
internode cacheline, but these machines have lots of memory too.  I 
thought a  simpler padding solution might be acceptable as futex_queues 
would be large only on our boxes.
Maybe we can dynamically allocate spinlocks, but it would be difficult to
say which node the spinlock should come from as yet.
