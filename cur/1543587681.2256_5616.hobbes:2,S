The latest version is always available at

Release 1.1.3: 
	* Freeze color changed from cyan to blue.
	* Tom Rini's network-configuration patches.
	* Better detection of set variables to be colored green.
	* Minor resize and scrolling fixes in menuconfig.
	* Fixed a rather nasty bug involving side-effect computation 
	  that showed up if you set, unset, and reset a symbol in a
	  choices menu.
	* In non-choice menus, select bar is now advanced after [ymn].
Point release -- bug fixes and UI cleanups.

The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any
member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm
to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient
warrant
	-- John Stuart Mill, "On Liberty", 1859
