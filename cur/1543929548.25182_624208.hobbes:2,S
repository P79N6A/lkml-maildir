Interesting.  Currently /proc/net is also per network namespace.
So normally I would say just call get_proc_net from inside your
proc handler and all would be well.
At another location in /proc (not under /proc/net) I would just do:
dev_get_by_name(current->nsproxy->net_ns, "ethX");
I would probably be paranoid and grab current->nsproxy->net_ns
when the file was opened and put it when the file was closed
just to ensure that if someone opened it and then passed
the file descriptor to someone else there were not any
weird little races.  But I don't expect that is a problem
in your case.

It probably is easiest to move the devices after your module has
bridged them.
