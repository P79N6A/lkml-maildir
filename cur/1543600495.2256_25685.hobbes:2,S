	It seems if connect() is called without bind() and the target
is local address the selected source is the same (the preferred address
is not used). The postfix guys simply can try this proposal (I don't
know whether they tried it already). I don't expect netfilter to make
loops by connecting the both ends on same host, so such solution can
return the best actual result that is possible at the time of the request.
Any assumptions on daemon start what are the local IP addresses can be
wrong for some strange setups.
	May be someone can check whether this is a portable way to
check whether one IP is local. [We know that bind() to IP is not such
solution, at least in Linux]. If this is true, I think, it is better than
using ioctls or talking rtnetlink.
	As for the "local networks" there is no such thing. There are
trusted and non-trusted networks, gatewayed and non-gatewayed, etc. So, it
should be a user-defined setting, if used somehow at all.
