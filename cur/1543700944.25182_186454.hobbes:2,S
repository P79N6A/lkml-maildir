I was originally running 1.2.7 when I first encountered the problem. I
then built 1.2.8 -but no difference.
Zinf does indeed use the ALSA interface (as most apps do nowadays).
I would say the symptoms are that the music starts playing OK bit after
a short period (18-19 seconds), the music changes overall speed (by a
semi-tone or so). When it does this, the sound also starts to break up.
This is why I associated the problem with the process scheduling changes
being made at the time.
It could be a driver issue. FYI, I am using a VIA KT400 chipset. Any one
know of any low-level timing issues with the KT400?
