   SSE2 has hints for that (prefetchnti and even prefetcht0,1 etc. for different
   cache hierarchies), but it's not completely clear on how much
   the CPUs follow these. 
   
   For writing it's much more obvious and usually documented even.
See "montdq/movnti", the latter of which even works on register
registers.  Ben LaHaise pointed this out to me earlier today.
