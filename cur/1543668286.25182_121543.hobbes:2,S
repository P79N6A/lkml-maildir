I know that 16bit is getting small (but with dynamic assignment even 
that is still enough for most people), but OTOH I don't understand the 
obsession for 64bit. 32bit is more than enough on a 32bit system.
Somehow it sounds that we just have to introduce a huge dev_t and all our 
problems are magically solved and I doubt that. If people want to encode 
random information into dev_t, then even 64bit will be soon not enough 
anymore, so I want to know how people actually want to use that large 
dev_t number. Is that really too much to ask?
(Slowly I'm getting the feeling that there is some sort of 64bit dev_t 
conspiracy going on here, with the amount of answers I'm (not) getting 
here.)
bye, Roman
