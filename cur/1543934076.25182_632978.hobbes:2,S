    There is some interaction with the large block size (but only on the 
SATA
disk).  Counts were adjusted to keep the read near 2G (~2x physical memory).
 From 1k-16k block sizes, I got into the low-mid 40MB/s on buffered SATA
(compared to 50-60MB/s on ATA & SCSI).  Starting at 32k-64k, the read
rate began falling and at 128k block-reads-at-a-time or larger, it drops 
below
20MB/s (again, only on buffered SATA).   It's hard to imagine what would
slow down buffered SATA reads but not ATA and SCSI reads of the same
size.  I'm using the 'cfq' scheduler with everything running at default
priorities, but again, why only SATA slowness?  It seems that at the driver
level, using direct reads, the SATA disk has the highest read rate (near
80MB/s). 
    It would certainly be perverse to have faster driver & device 
performance
equate to lower buffered I/O.

    The only way I could tell before was using hdparm to read the 
parameters.
Since that doesn't work, it's hard to tell if they are set correctly, 
but given
the high performance at the device driver level, I'm guessing the params
are set correctly.

    Hmm... might be nice as an "RFE" to at least have the 'read-status'
commands work to see what the params are set to. 
    More importantly, how does one set parameters for acoustic and power
saving parameters?  Some of my disks are used as 'backup' devices for my
other computers.  With the ATA disks, they were kept "spun down" when not
being used (only used, 'normally', in early AM hours).
    Another new "problem" (not as important) -- even though SATA disks are
called with "sdX", my ATA disks that *were* at hda-hdc are now at hde-hdg.
Devices hda-hdd are not populated in my dev directory on bootup.  Of course
this throws off boot-scripts that set diskparams by "hd<name>" and not
by label (using hdparm).  Seems like the SATA disks are suffering a partial
identity problem -- seeming to reserve hda-hdd, but using the "sd" disk 
names.
Is that a known problem?  If not, I'll add it to my queue for bug-filing...
thanks,
Linda
