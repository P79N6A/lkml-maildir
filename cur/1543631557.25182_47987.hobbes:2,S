Heh, now that is interesting.
Or maybe not - not too long ago I did some tests of the various
optimization options in gcc 2.96 or so and found that -O2 generates
smaller code in most cases than -Os.  -Os also did not perform as good,
but I was just testing a few bits of code - nothing as versatile as the
kernel.
The end result was I recommend -O2 for both performance and size.  Maybe
I should retest against the kernel...
