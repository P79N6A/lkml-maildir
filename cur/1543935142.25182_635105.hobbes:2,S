Seems reasonable.
As a followup thing, we now have two hard-coded magical -5's in kthread.c. 
It'd be nice to add a #define for this.
It'd be nicer to work out where on earth that -5 came from too ;)
Readers might wonder why kthreadd children disinherit kthreadd's policy and
priority, but retain its cpus_allowed (and whatever other stuff root could have
altered?)
