The i82365 stuff actually used to do much of this, but it was so
intimately intertwined with the cardbus handling that I pruned it out for
my sanity.
It should be possible to do the same thing with a nice simple concentrated
PCI probe, instead of having stuff quite as spread out as it used to be.
As to why it doesn't show any ISA interrupts, who knows... Some of the PCI
PCMCIA bridges need to be initialized.
