Unfortunately the most important instance of the in-kernel flag -- the
global one in the somewhat misnamed boot_cpu_data.x86_features --
isn't actually readable in the /proc/cpuinfo file.  It is perfectly
possible (e.g. the "notsc" option) for ALL the CPUs to report this
capability, but the global capability to still be off.
I would like to have exported the global capabilities into
/proc/cpuinfo, but I'm worried about breaking software (the "flags"
versus "features" issue was bad enough -- unfortunately, in cases like
this, there probably is no "good" solution.)
