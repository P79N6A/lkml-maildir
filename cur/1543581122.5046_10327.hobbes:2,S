  Hi, all. I've just released version 1.3.11 of my devfsd (devfs
daemon) at: 
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
This works with devfs-patch-v130 and devfs-patch-v99.7 (or later).
The main changes are:
- Workaround changes in glibc 2.2
- Handle cases where fds [0:2] are closed already.
				Regards,
					Richard....
