Yes this stuff has all been merged to the DRM CVS, and agreed upon by
everyone as a good idea, there is a second set of patches that clean up
another group of macros (the drmfntbl-0-0-2-branch) and they will be
coming your direction soon, again all DRI people are happy that this is
the direction we need to go in...
Dave.
