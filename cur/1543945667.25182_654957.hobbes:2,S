Bustage in x86-configurable-dmi-scanning-code.patch.  Previously, DMI=y was
just hardwired.  Now, it becomes selectable and stuff breaks.
I guess the DMI=n version of dmi_check_system() could become a macro so we
don't emit a reference to its argument, but that might generate
unused-variable warnings elsewhere.
