Hi,
Two changes before -final. The first one fixes a race where
one can hit a BUG(), the second one fixes CVE-2006-4814.
-final is just a few days ahead (it scares me, I'll have to check
my scripts to ensure everything's OK). If you have important fixes
you want to see in, or if it does not work for you, please
manifest yourself.
Willy
