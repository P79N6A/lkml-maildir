Well, it seems to me the general problem is generating the proper 
hotplug events.  If you actually pull, say, a USB device, the usb 
subsystem will tell you about it as it happens.  But if you can suspend 
the machine and then arbitrarily rearrange the hardware, then on resume 
you'd have to go over the current hardware state and compare it to the 
pre-suspend state and generate all those events.  Or I guess you could 
just generate unplug events for everything at suspend and re-plug 
anything you find on resume.  Sounds pretty heavyweight though.
