Unfortunately in the real world, many people *don't* have a choice. They
are limited to using what they can afford, or what their employer,
university, or thesis advisor provides or requires. People also have
system with built-in devices which either can't be removed or which will
void waranty if the devices are removed.
If the NDIS software allows development of OS drivers for the hardware
people *must* use, then they will at least have a choice of the operating
system. And if it improves reverse engineering some companies will avoid
NDIS just for that reason. Sounds like two good results to me.
The idea that all vendors would drop open spec and open source is totally
unrelated to reality, some companies provided that information when the
Linux market was tiny, they are not going to change, and neither are the
companies who don't release info now.
I'm curious if the NDIS stuff could be run in ring 1 or 2, being an old
MULTICS guy. Not for political reasons, just good tech.
