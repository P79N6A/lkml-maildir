Did I miss a bug report?  The only problems I'm currently aware of are
the ones where using MMCONFIG during BAR probing causes a hard lockup on
some Intel machines, and the ones where we get bad config data on some
AMD machines due to the configuration retry status being mishandled.
All the other lockups I'm aware of are already handled by the existing
checks.
