It's the CONFIG_NR_CPUS=4096 but nr_cpu_ids=4 case which we win using
dynamic allocation.  Gotta love distribution kernels.

Yes.  And undefine 'struct cpumask' if CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK.  That
will stop assignment and on-stack declarations for all but the most
determined.

Not quite.  If !CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK, cpumask_var_t == cpumask_t[1].
Blame Linus :)
