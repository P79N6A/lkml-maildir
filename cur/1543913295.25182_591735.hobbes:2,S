Thats really the point I'm trying to make.  O_NONBLOCK should be the default,
but it isn't in the case of modprobe. If you look at the rmmod sources,
O_NONBLOCK is set in the flags field in the main routine, and cleared if the -w
option is set.  Whereas in the modprobe sources the only call ever made to
delete_module passes the O_EXLC flag only, and never sets O_NONBLOCK, resulting
in persistent blocking operation.  My 2nd patch corrects this by adding a flags
variable to modprobe and setting it to O_NONBLOCK|O_EXLC, and clearing it if the
(new) -w option is specified to modprobe, just like in rmmod.
Now, I suppose its possible that I've not been looking at the right source tree
when doing my work.  I've based my modprobe patch on this git tree:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/kyle/module-init-tools.git;a=summary
If theres a newer one, if you could please point it out to me, I'd appreciate
it.  If the functional equivalent of my second patch is already in there, then
we just need my first patch to be good to go.
Thanks & Regards
Neil
