Excellent analysis, Willy. Quite frankly, I am not keen on making this
driver any more complex, especially if the gains are marginal at best. VIA
Rhine will never be high-performance hardware, and we have too much special
casing already.
Patches to fix actual problems (such as the recent irq init work by Dave
Jones) are much more interesting to me (and presumably to most via-rhine
users).
