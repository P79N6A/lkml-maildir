Please excuse this test. My last two messages to the list never got
through (sendmail reports 'message accepted', but I never get a copy
back).
If I send to majordomo@vger.kernel.org, I get replies fine. I can post
to other majordomo lists. I was posting fine to linux-kernel until
recently. I'm pretty much out of ideas, if this doesn't get through.
If this does get through, and for whatever reason I'm not getting a
copy of my own messages back, someone please reply.
Again, I appologize for this message.
