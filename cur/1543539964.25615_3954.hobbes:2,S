Greetings,
Please /dev/null after reading do not comment online, offline is cool.
The current feedback from the Standards Folks is that they think they are
protected enough and this is cool.
Since more than 50% of the commands (IO entry points) are vender specific
and I do not know how to handle the returns, go for it.
At best you will piss off the drive (in the current format of the driver).
The next case is that you hang the kernel.
Last and worst case, you rip your data.
Enjoy you bit-banging and chicken-little will no longer try to catch the
sky in Linux!
Maybe in 2.5 or 2.4.2 you will get the full taskfile access and have your
ROOT powers restored, and have the option for fixing the driver to handle
137GB and larger drive formats, and the super sets of SerialATA.
Thanks for the blow torch hair cut, and the folks that are still friends
after the abuse they took from me......
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
