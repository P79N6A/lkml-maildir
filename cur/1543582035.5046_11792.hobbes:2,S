Will you please go off and prove that this "problem" exists on some x86
processor before continuing this rant?  None of the PII, PIII, Athlon,
K6-2 or 486s I checked exhibited the worrisome behaviour you're
speculating about, plus it is logically consistent with the statements the
manual does make about updating ptes; otherwise how could an smp os
perform a reliable shootdown by doing an atomic bit clear on the present
bit of a pte?
