Hi Con,
In recent testing unrelated to your interactivity stuff,
I have found the following with 74-mm2, although I don't
think its due to your interactivity stuff.
I don't have a real workload that is bothered by this btw.
Just wondering if its fixable, or there is a reason for it.
On UP, 2 processes of same priority. One is doing an
infinite loop of nothing, the other doing an infinite loop
of fork+waiting for children which count to a million then
exit (do a bit of work).
The non forking CPU hog gets 75% of the cpu.
