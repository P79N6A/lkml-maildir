	   Please take a look and consider applying.
I can't see how this change is correct, the existing code is buggy for
sure, but the fix is nearly worse than the cure, so shouldn't the
change be:
1) sed 's/kfree(skb)/kfree_skb(skb)//'
2) If newskb == NULL, return 0
3) Else skb = newskb, and continue on to transmit the ddp message
If you agree, please send a new patch which in fact does this.
Patch not applied.
Later,
