Wouldn't this problem be avoided if the kernel DIDN'T overcommit memory?
I mean, nobody tolerates their filesystem overcommitting blocks it
doesn't have (or maybe they do and my reality is a myth). Why should
it be tolerated for virtual memory?
Are the benefits to saying "uh, sure. we only have 600 megs of VM, but uh,
feel free to let your system commit 1 gig" worth it? What makes that
behavior desirable?
I'm not condemning, I'm just curious.
