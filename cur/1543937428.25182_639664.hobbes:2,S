Mike,
 thanks for the offer, but the improved throughput is my #1 priority nowadays.
And while the better scaling for different targets is nothing to frown upon, the
much better scaling when writing to the same target would have been the big
winner for me.
 Anyway, I located the "offending" commit. Lets see what the experts say.
