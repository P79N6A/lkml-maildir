That's a new and interesting thing to add to the list of things
that /usr/include/linux is _not_:
/usr/include/linux is _not_ a place to dump "reference code" in lieu of
documentation on using kernel interfaces.
Besides, the _syscallX implementations in the kernel were generally
unsuitable for use in that way anyway -- I'd be much more inclined to
rely on the libc version. The kernel version would do strange things
like break with PIC code by using an unavailable register (i386),
misalign 64-bit syscall arguments on 32-bit machines (MIPS), etc.

I assume these were very _early_ glibc in when the port was new?

The limited subset of old userland which elected to use _syscallX()
instead of libc's syscall(), and which can be fixed fairly easily.
