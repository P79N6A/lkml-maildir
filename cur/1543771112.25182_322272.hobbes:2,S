I prefere, and I do it, explicit asking for a CC.

It is a lot easier to find personal mails than to suppress dupes.
In the former case you can look at References or IRT fields and in the
later you have to *keep* a list of Message-IDs and search it everytime
you receive a letter.
And direct replying generates more traffic.
I started this thread because I never liked to receive personal
duplicates of mails sent to lists. That is why I decided to ask you for
your opinion.
