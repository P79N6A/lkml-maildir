patch 1/6: Remove unnecessary eh_bus_reset_handler callsback
           The callback function used by zfcp always returns success,
           which is an indication for the SCSI midlayer to stop error
           handling. Remove the bus_reset callback, since the same
           function will be called via the host_reset callback.
patch 2/6: Use also port and adapter to identify unit in messages
           Add the appropriate messages.
patch 3/6: Specify waiting times in ERP in seconds
           It is not necessary to use jiffies or milliseconds to specify
           waiting times that last a couple of seconds.
patch 4/6: Remove SCSI devices when removing adapter
           The common I/O layer can call remove a handler to inform zfcp
           that a device disappeared. The handler zfcp_ccw_remove then
           removes all unit, port and the adapter data structures. Removing
           the units requires that the SCSI devices are removed first.
patch 5/6: Fix deadlock when adding invalid LUN
           When adding an invalid LUN, there is a deadlock between the add
           via scsi_scan_target and the slave_destroy handler: The handler
           waits for the scan to complete, but for an invalid unit,
           scsi_scan_target directly calls the slave_destroy handler.
           Fix the deadlock by removing the wait in the slave_destroy
           handler, it was not necessary anyway.
patch 6/6: Reduce flood on HBA trace
           Remove tracing for request with a "qualifier" field set in the
           response. Â The protocol status qualifier now contains measurement
           data for "good" commands, so this check would trace every response
           by default.
           The fix is to simply remove the "qual" tracing: The responses with an
           interesting status are also traced as "ferr" or "perr" and all
           responses can be traced as "norm" with a higher trace level.
