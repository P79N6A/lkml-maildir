I thought the idea was to remove that functionality out of the kernel
completely. In our case, we're only adding the "names" for the cards
that "our" driver supports. We have a 16 or 20-byte structure per card
already, and if we want, we can declare it all to be init_data.
Anyway, if you don't like the strings-in-the-table approach, we should
move to an exported function from oldproc which returns the name of a
PCI device.
If oldproc is configured to be "on", it will return a pointer to a
string like "Specialix Speed4", while if it is "Off", it should return
a pointer to the string "11CB:9501". 
Make sure that the function is always available, wether or not the
OLDPROC configuration option is turned on. This will prevent ifdefs
all over the place. 
So we'd get: 
	printk ("Detected PCI serial card %s at 0x%x: %d ports.\n", 
		pci_dev_name (pdev), pdev->base[0], table[i].nports);
Printing:
	Detected PCI serial card Specialix Speed4 at 0xff00: 4 ports.
or
	Detected PCI serial card 1415:9501 at 0xff00: 4 ports.
depending on wether or not "oldproc" is configured.
Ok. I agree on the "overclocking" issue. 
(You CAN overheat celerons by the way. Be careful).
