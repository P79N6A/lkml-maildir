My suggestion would be one of two alternatives:
1) At each release, Linus clones
	linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.6
		to
	linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.6.11
and gives the "release team" access to push to linux-2.6.11 repo.
2) Create linux-release.bkbits.net, and some non-Linus person clones 
linux-2.6 at release time to linux-2.6.11.
This accomplishes two [minor] goals:
a) the tree lives at bkbits.net, as has a name associated with the goal 
of the project
b) The repo has the _exact_ name of the kernel release.  None of this 
"linux-2.6.11.y" stuff.  Just "linux-2.6.11".  Anything else violates 
the Principle of Least Surprise.

I was wondering if it would be possible to setup a list on vger that is 
public, but read-only to everyone but the $sucker team.
