Hi,
Ok, I think I discovered a bug in the kernel
(and my thought is that it is located in the SCSI part).
The result of the bug is a complete freeze of my computer. It
still answer to 'ping' and seems to have his usual ports open,
but they are simply not working.
I already encountered this sort of behaviour on an Alsa-driver
bug. It was a deadlock because I have an SMP. I guess it is the
same now.
So, here is the recipe to make your brand new 2.4.19 crash
(I tried to isolate as much as possible the bug):
1) Get the last Maxi-single from Sophie Ellis Bextor
    (It's called: Get Over You).
2) Try to rip the track 5 with cdparanoia. For example:
   cdparanoia -Z 5
3) Wait a little bit... Bingo, you get it.
It's 100% reproducible. I never went through a complete
ripping session.
There is a lot of error messages appearing on the screen but
at the time it appear, I have no more control of anything...
I manage to copy down some:
Recovery code sleeping
(scsi:0:A:4:0): Abort Message Sent
Recovery code awake
Timer Expired
.... and so on.
Here are some infos about my computer:
[fleury@yggdrasil scripts]$ sh  ./ver_linux
If some fields are empty or look unusual you may have an old version.
Compare to the current minimal requirements in Documentation/Changes.

And, I attach my .config file to this mail.
The config should be tight enough to make you aware of most of
my hardware... I have also get the magic keys to work, but I
didn't get any useful information from it... :-/
I you need more information, or if you want me to perform so
tests, just ask. I would be always pleased to hunt a bug.
I don't know who's in charge for this bug because it is not
clear for me where the bug is located...
Regards
