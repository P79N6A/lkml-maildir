FWIW pci_pool predates mempool by quite a bit (2.4.early vs 2.5.later),
and I don't think I've noticed any correlation between allocation using
the "pool" word and reserving memory ... so I thought it was "mempool"
that clashed.  No big deal IMO, "all the good words are taken".
I seem to recall it was a portability issue that made pci_pool never
release pages once it allocates them ... some platform couldn't cope
with pci_free_consistent() being called in_interrupt().  In practice
that seems to have been a good enough reservation scheme so far.
