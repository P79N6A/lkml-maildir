Ahh, right. 
Alessio, try Daniel's patch. We'd love to hear if it works, and in 
particular what the dmesg output is (if it does work, it should print out 
something like
	PIIX4 ACPI PIO at 2000-203f
	PIIX4 SMB PIO at 2040-204f
and perhaps even a few "PIIX4 devres X" lines..)
Alessio, it might also make sense to try to enable ACPI if you haven't 
done so - not because you need to use it, but because sometimes the ACPI 
table parsing also ends up exposing these kinds of things..
