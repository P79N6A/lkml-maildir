I'm testing bonding e1000 cards under 2.4.20 and it seems to work fine,
however: I would like to know a decent brand of switch that can support
round-robin or XOR at gigabit speeds.
Documentation/networking/bonding.txt has only 10/100 information in it.
Is there any preferred linux supporting brand?
Also, should I submit a bug report on the fact that bonding using the
ns83820.o driver causes kernel panics, or is that a known issue?
