You sign it off in the patch submission.  It's enough that you agree on it 
and let us know a sign off line:
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@somewhere.com>
which the patch submitter (probably Francois) adds to the patch 
when it is being submitted.  There is no actual documentation you need to 
sign off.  Thanks.
