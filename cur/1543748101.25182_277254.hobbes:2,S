Hello!
Well my experience is that it very hard not to say almost impossible to 
extrapolate idle cpu into any network system capacity. I guess this is 
what you are trying to do? 
Rather load and overload the system with traffic having the characteristics
you expect as a bonus you will get some kind proof of robustness and 
responsiveness a max load. There are tools for this type of tests.
Pádraig! Very funny... I started hacking 2 hours ago on idea I 
had for long time, This to do a light version of skb recycling based
skb->users (the pktgen trick) with very minimal kernel change..
