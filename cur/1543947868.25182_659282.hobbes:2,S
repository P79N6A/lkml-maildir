What I want is at least one defconfig per subarchitecture for compile 
tests.
And especially considering the original purpose "configuration users can 
use as a starting point for configuring their kernel" I even wouldn't 
mind if we had a few dozen x86 defconfigs.

You are testing something completely different here.
What I want is that e.g. after fiddling with kernel headers I want an 
easy way of having much compile coverage. And my script that builds all 
defconfig's is trivial (although it takes a day to finish).

You miss our headers mess.
You remember how your big x86 merge this merge window broke 8 or 9 other 
architectures? Change one file under include/ and watch how many 
configurations no longer build.
Or other subtle differences between the subarchs that have in the past 
led to compile errors.
I do consider them useful for the way I'm doing kernel tests, and even 
if you don't consider them that useful can we agree that adding a 
defconfig is neither a big deal for the subarchitecture maintainer nor 
imposes any maintainance work on you as maintainer (except for sometimes 
applying patches adding/updating them)?

Generally agreed (with my biggest worry being whether changing 
CLOCK_TICK_RATE from a compile time constant to a runtime
variable has any performance effects).
