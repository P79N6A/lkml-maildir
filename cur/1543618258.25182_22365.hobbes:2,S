Absolutely agreed.  One of the main design elements for such an
interface would be doing all filesystem things in the filesystem
and all VM things in the VM so we don't get frankenstein monsters
on either side of the fence.

One of the things we really want to do in the VM is pre-clean
data and just reclaim clean pages later on.
This means it would be easiest/best if the filesystem took
care of _just_ writing out data and if freeing the data later
on would be left to the VM.
I understand this is not always possible due to stuff like
metadata repacking, but I guess we can ignore this case for
now since the metadata is hopefully small and won't unbalance
the VM.

Rik
