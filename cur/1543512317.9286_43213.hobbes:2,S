In my case it's normally happened in the midst of an updatedb
(i.e. heavy disk access and lots of context switches to give frcode a
chance to run &c), but it did not appear to *require* any of these. I've
had it die a couple of times when sitting there doing nothing but
serving the odd small NFS request. (I'm using unfsd, so it's not likely
to be *that* at fault.)
