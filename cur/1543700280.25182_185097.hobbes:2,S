Hi,
I have integrated powerpc kgdb from TimeSys Linux into mainline kgdb at 
http://kgdb.sourceforge.net/
 into kgdb for Linux kernel 2.4.23.
It has been integrated with x86 kgdb, hence all features of x86 kgdb are 
available including thread support.
I don't have powerpc hardware to test it, so any problem reports and fixes to 
make it really work are most welcome!!
