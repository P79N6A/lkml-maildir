While you are (somewhat) on the topic of starting processors, I want to
benchmark and application on a dual Xeon system. I want to try these
configurations, preferably without opening the box, since it's in
another time zone.
  2 cpu w/ ht		normal boot
  2 cpu w/o ht		noht
  1 cpu w/o ht		nosmp noht
  1 cpu w/ ht		???
It looks as if maxcpus=2 counts physical units? I can't try it until Monday.
