Not only code size, far more important is dynamic memory consumption.
[admittedly we right now lack a good instrumentation framework for this]

The problem I see is more that really nobody can even compile not 
alone test all these combinations anymore. Hidding the problem in inlines
does not solve that. And no randconfig is not the solution either.

Whatever pays off.
