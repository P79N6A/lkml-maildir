Hello linux kernel hackers,
I recently installed RedHat 6.2 beta version where  i tried to install the EPSO
STYLUS COLOR 860 printer but with no good result. I made use of all the epson
printer filters one by one but i did not had a lack.
To help you about the parallel port configuration in the kernel i chosse the
following:
GENERAL SETUP:
	Parallel port Support (Yes)
	PC Style Hardware   (Module)
CHARACTER DEVICES:
	Parallel printer support (Module)
	SUPPORT IEEE1284 STATUS READBACK (YES)
In the BIOS the parallel port is set at interupt 237/5 @ SPP.
Moreover, i used all the BIOS combination for the configuration of the parallel
port and i had again no lack.
Using the printtool program when i tried to print a test page it had a respond
that the page was succesfully printed (!), but the printer did not repsond
again. Looking quickly after the command to print a test page at the lpq the
job was active but after some time it goes off (about 6 secs).
Also i used XW Tools for the printer but i also i did not have lack.
Finnaly, the printer is new, it is running perfectly on WINDOWS ( 8-( ) and the
parallel port is also looking good.
I would be grateful to you if you can give me a hand on the above problem,
Thank you in advance,
Georgios Kossionis
