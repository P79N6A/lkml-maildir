sorry for delay, however i tested it and works perfectly.
just 2 things to notice:
1) [unrelated to this bug] swsusp ram pages write and read is really
slower than 2.6.14 one. i didn't follow changes, so don't know what happened
2) when i suspend i continue to see errors 0x660 in my tty. The strange
thing is that after resume they are no more in dmesg!
strange. however, as i wrote before, it works.
ps. i tested with module only, i'll switch back to built-in solution but
i think there won't be any problems.
big thanks to takashi for patch, please apply.
