Of course. But that's not the only race. You need to make certain that
any shared resource (your driver) only allows a single execution-
thread anywhere there is shared data or the hardware itself. This
is generally accomplished with semaphore(s), a.k.a, down() and up().
Note that each open() call provides its own 'struct file' pointer.
The kernel won't get them mixed up. You can use your private-data
pointer available in this structure in each open() and use that
for private data in each access. You can free such private data
in a close(). But, that's just the obvious stuff. User-mode threads
share open files!
That means that your driver has no way of isolating such access
except by using semaphores.
