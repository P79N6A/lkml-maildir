Well, I just have found a way to download single diffs out of bkbits, 
so I can probably just interface with that. Remember, I have to track 
only two files.
Mine was the point of view of a small kernel worker, I maintain only 
one driver and I don't want to commit more resources to the task than 
what would be reasonable. The difference in storage space is measurable 
in several hundredth of megabytes, and that is a big gain on my poor 
resources.
However, that does not remove any value from your howto, that is both 
complete and useful.
