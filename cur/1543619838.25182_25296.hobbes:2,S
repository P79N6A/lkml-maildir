SIOCDEVICE, yes. That's my attempt to create an ioctl interface for
controlling devices. It's defined by the hdlc patch, discussed about
a year (?) ago here. Yes, I think I should post a note here.
SIOCDEVPRIVATE - an older method of controlling net devices. IMHO, not
very useful, could possibly be used as a devel hack. Many net drivers
use it.
A new patch which applies to 2.5.3 is in the usual place:
ftp://ftp.pm.waw.pl/pub/linux/hdlc/
This is what I want included in base kernel.
