Only the fact that cpusets have _very_ special meaning in the oom-killer
codepath, while it should be just another tunable (if it should be
special code at all at the first place, why there were no objection and
argument, that tasks could have different oom_adj?).

And that is The Main Point. Not to help some subsystem, but be useful
for others. It is different tunable. It has really nothing with cpusets.
It is not aimed to help or make things worse for the cpusets. I even do
not understand why this very specific case not used by the wast majority
of the users was even rised in the discussion of the system-wide
oom-killer bahaviour and its more precise cgroup tunable.
This is different. It has its own tunable, which is used when cpusets
are enabled. Discussed tunable should be used at its own time. Admin has
a right to decide how he wants to tune oom-killer behaviour. And the
only point I hear, is that something does not help when we have cpusets
enabled.

Then do not use anything else when cpusets are enabled.
Do not compile SuperH cpu support when you do not have such processes.
Do not enable iscsi support if you do not need this.
Do not enable cgroup oom-killer tunable when you want cpuset.

Besides the fact that it is possible that userspace will not even wake
up. Since to wake it up we have to swap it out, which in turn needs some
memory, which we do not have, since we are in, hmm, Out-Of-Memory
condition.
There may be cases when this will work, I do not argue. But so far the
most common case I imagine is when it will not be able to wake up :)

Please explain, how task will make that decision (like freeing some
ram), when it can not be even swapped out? It is a great idea to be able
to monitor memory usage, but relying on that just does not work.

Yup, it will wait for some timeout while userspace will respond. The
problem is that it will not in some cases. And so far I think (and I may
be wrong), that it will not be able to respond most of the time.
In every oom-condition I worked with, system was completely unusable
before oom-killer started to berserk several processes. They were not
able to allocate some data to read network input (atomic context) and to
even read a console input.
What I want to say is the simple matter of the iteraction within the
kernel oom-handler. Let it be as smart or as stupid as admin decided. I
have no objection against letting it to get some knowledge from the
outsude of its own world (like wait for userspace to respond). I vote by
both hands for implementing some kind of notification mechanism which
could be used by the userspace to get oom-notifications in particular
and to watch its (or system-wide) memory usage in general.
But all those things should be additional tunables. Which do not even
remotely, even theoretically allow a lockup. So userspace notifications
are great as long as this is not the only way to have a progress in the
OOM situation. And the highest priority in this case should be kernel
and its tunables (like proposed cgroup patch), since relying on
userspace in this case may be fatal. But of course it can be enabled and
contribute.
