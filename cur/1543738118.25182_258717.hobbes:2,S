Please use RFC private addresses in example code.
That being said, bsdjail is a very good idea (which is why we're stealing
it from BSD after all ...). It affords lightweight compartmentalization,
in other words a chroot-on-steroids, which is exactly what I need to split
one box into a couple of mostly-independent realms, and I assume that many
ISP/ASP/whatever hosting people will agree.
Anyway, that's my vote for adding it to the kernel.
