we'd have to define some lists ... like an "obsolete" list where we
could say "do not warn about function XXX if function YYY is supplied"
... for example, we dont provide mmap() because we only use mmap2()
...
then we'd need a list for no-mmu where we could list ones that dont
make sense for us ...
to be sure, there are functions in that list we should be implementing
but no one has noticed/complained so it hasnt been an issue ;)
