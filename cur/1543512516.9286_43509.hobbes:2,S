I think my original message got lost amongst the other threads last
week... I've had some time to do some more testing, anyway:
I recently upgraded from 2.2.12 to 2.3.19. Now my serial port doesn't work
properly, unless I do an explicit
setserial /dev/modem autoconfig
When I turn my modem on, or when the computer boots, whichever is last,
the HS, SD, and RD lights come on. Sometimes the TR light comes on as
well. Using minicom just has a line of garbage rather than the usual line
of AT commands under 2.2.
Letting minicom reset the modem clears the SD and RD lights, but the modem
still doesn't work. Its detected the IO and IRQ stuff correctly, but I
still need the setserial command to get the modem working.
After that, minicom/ppp works fine. The TR and HS lights stay on.
setserial -a shows no difference after running the autoconfig command.
This happens with both serial ports. Haven't tried a serial mouse yet,
only my modem.
The modem works fine in 2.2.x.
Thanks,
Bradley
