Subject: Problems with using more than 960MB RAM (2.0.36-2.2.3)

I have just recently built a Linux server that has 1024MB of RAM installed.
I noticed when booting from the install disk that the kernel on it (2.0.36)
would detect all of the memory, but only use 960MB of it. It then proceeded
boot, only to panic just after the disk detection routines. So, I make a
boot disk using 2.2.3-ac4 and I get just about the same results. Is this a
problem and is there a solution already?
