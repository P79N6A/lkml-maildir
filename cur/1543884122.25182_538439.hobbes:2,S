Well, this is just the part where I'm surveying how other OS's report
getrusage-like info on a per-thread basis. As far as this is concerned,
RUSAGE_LWP is just Solaris nomenclature for it. The implementation
details (e.g. M:N thread disambiguation) are not so important for this.
What I think it means is "Solaris and AIX pass a nonstandard flag to
getrusage() for the same purpose."
And actually, you're a good person to ask about all this. How do other
kernels/OS's report per-thread analogues of rusage information? Googling
for getrusage() manpages is probably not going to find ones that, say,
force userspace to fish it out of /proc/ analogues and so on. The basic
idea is to try to do it similarly to how everyone else does so userspace
(I suppose this would include glibc) don't have to bend over backward to
accommodate it. Or basically to do what everyone expects.
