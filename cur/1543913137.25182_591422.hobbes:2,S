It's IMHO a bad idea to add any overrides without access to data sheets
and errata sheets. The hardware might be broken and do bad
(subtle) bad things with HPET.  That's not a theoretical case.
There used to be at least one case where a chipset would occasionally
destroy the BIOS flash when HPET was force enabled.
That means for Intel it's fine to do (because errata sheets are public); but 
for Nvidia and VIA it's dangerous and should not be done.
