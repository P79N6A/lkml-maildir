Subject: PATCH (RFC): Rework the 8250 console fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Russell got various bits of mail showing the 8250 console fix broke some
setups with the assumptions it made. Based on this suggestion that we
actually need to just do the locking I've prepared an alternative
patch. 
The patch does one thing a little oddly. If an oops is in progress it
only attempts to take the port lock and continues regardless. In that
situation the oops will hit the console but things may be a bit odd
thereafter. Getting the oops out seems to be the important thing to do
in that situation.
There are two questions that I think make this an RFC not a final patch
1.	Should this be pushed up into serial/serial_core.c for all chips.
2.	Is the use of local_irq_save/spin_trylock spin_unlock_irqrestore
going to break any platforms that do weird stuff or do we need a
spin_trylock_irqsave ?
