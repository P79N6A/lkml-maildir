Hmm. There's a bug in "balance_irq()" if you are trying to run a SMP
kernel on an UP machine right now, and it _might_ be that the lockup has
nothing to do with the IDE layer, but simple with the first PCI interrupt
(as opposed to local timer interrupt) coming in.
One-liner from Zwane Mwaikambo (cut-and-paste, so space is wrong, please
apply by hand).

I don't know. Might be the IDE code too, of course.
