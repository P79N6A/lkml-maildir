most 100Mb/s ethernet card/switch combo's will happily push 90+ Mb/s 
bi-directionally between two hosts.

well maybe your "realtime" application doesn't run on linux.
if you want non-degrading ethernet performance buy a switch, if you want 
bandwidth reservation, buy an l3 switch.
There just isn't anyone using arcnet or arcnet+ anymore, the writing was 
on the wall for thomas conrad more than a decade ago, and my datapoint 
mainframe days are far behind me, and I don't miss them.
