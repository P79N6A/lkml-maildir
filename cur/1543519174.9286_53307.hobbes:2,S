Rogier,
You committed a mortal sin in ATA............
You never ever mix WD and Maxtor..........on day I will document why.
Basically these two vendors have timings that are completely incompatable
with each other on the same channel.
IMHO, WD is crap..........however, you may split the two pieces of
hardware and they will work fine under linux and all other OS's.
This rule of "never ever mix WD and Maxtor" is OS independent.
Do you mean Triton II classic PIIX?
