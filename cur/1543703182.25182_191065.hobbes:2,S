I know of one bug in it which will thoroughly smash user data beyond
recognition - it happens when you resize RAID-5 arrays on disks that are
not of equal size.  Should be easy to fix, if one tried  :)
If you want it in the kernel doing hot-resizing, you probably want to
add some sort of 'progress log' so that one can resume the
reconfiguration after a reboot - that should be doable, just isn't done
yet.
Right now it's entirely a user-space tool and it is not integrated with
the MD code to make it do hot-reconfiguration - integrating it with DM
and MD would make it truely useful.
