Hello,
I am using pcmcia token ring adapter together with dhcp protocol. When I used 2.2.13
everything works fine and I can get IP address via dhcp. (using pump)
But when I'm running 2.2.14 I don't obtaion IP address. I also try to use dhcpcd (even
with -r option) but it does not work. It does not work with 2.2.15pre7 also.
I do not know whether this is a bug but it just not work :)
Any ideas ?
I forget my sw config: Redhat 6.1 + pump-0.7.2-2/dhcpcd-1.3.17pl5-2
Best regards,
David Hajek
