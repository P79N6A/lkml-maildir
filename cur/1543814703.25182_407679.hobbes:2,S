Those are user accessible flags.  Fork will give you a
PTRACE_EVENT_FORK, vfork will give you a PTRACE_EVENT_VFORK, but
clone may give you any of the above, depending on what arguments you
pass to it.  The SIGCHLD test matches the bit described in clone(2)
for __WALL or __WCLONE, for instance.

One thing that IIRC was a problem was killing the parent before the
child (or maybe the other way round) when stopped at this point - such
as would happen if you typed "kill" at a GDB prompt after catch vfork.
