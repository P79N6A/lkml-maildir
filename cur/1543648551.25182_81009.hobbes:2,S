They should register their syscalls with the kernel properly. Look
at what e.g. the streams people did after the sys_call_table
removal.  It's enough that IRIX suffers from the syssgi syndrome, no
need to copy redo their mistakes in Linux.

But they don't allow any random module to implement it.  And anyone
asked today says the horrible sys_Scoketcall and sys_ipc cludges
were a mistake.
