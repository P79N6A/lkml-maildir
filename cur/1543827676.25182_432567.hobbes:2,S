I just wanted to report that this went away when trying 2.6.17-rc6 as a
host. It also works fine as a guest (after I patch it with
http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/work/current/2.6/2.6.17-rc4/patches/jmpbuf
so that it builds).
Besides, the random segfault problems I had with previous guests
versions also seem to be fixed.
Thanks a lot!
