It is new to kernel 2.6.0-test3 :
*** Warning: "video_proc_entry" [drivers/usb/media/ov511.ko] undefined!
And documentation seems obsolete :
This driver uses the Video For Linux API. You must say Y or M to
"Video For Linux" (under Character Devices) to use this driver.
Information on this API and pointers to "v4l" programs may be found
on the WWW at <
http://roadrunner.swansea.uk.linux.org/v4l.shtml>.
Not any more under Character Devices, isn't it ?
Regards.
Nicolas.
