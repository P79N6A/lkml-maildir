The NFS server acquires a lock on the exported filesystem before
granting it to an NFS client, so loopback mounting shouldn't add any
extra safety.  If you've witnessed some exception to this rule, please
let us know.

That's the way it works already, more or less.
(It depends a little on what you mean by "file and record locking".  The
byte-range locks acquired by fcntl() have always been enforced over NFS.
Locks acquired by flock() haven't always been, but loopback mounting
doesn't solve this problem.)
