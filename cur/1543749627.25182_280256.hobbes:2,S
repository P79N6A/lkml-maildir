I wouldn't touch the defaults, but the sysctl is there so if you've a
strange workload you can tune for it.
There's nothing wrong with dcache/icache growing a lot. A cat of a large
file is polluting the cache, so that's not a workload that should shrink
the dcache/icache. I'd prefer a feedback based on a real useful workload
before even considering touching the defaults at this time.
