Well I'm not sure what the semantic difference is between `size' and `len'.
They're not very well-chosen identifiers, really.
My point is that there is no need to store the "number of bytes currently
in the buffer", because that is always equal to `head - tail' if you allow
those indices to freely wrap.
All the struct needs is `head', `tail' and `number_of_bytes_at_buf', all
unsigned.
add(char c)
{
	p->buf[p->head++ % p->number_of_bytes_at_buf] = c;
}
get()
{
	return p->buf[p->tail++ %  p->number_of_bytes_at_buf];
}
free_space()
{
	return p->head - p->tail;
}
pretty simple...
