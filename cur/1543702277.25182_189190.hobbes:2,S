What you've described above is more or less the autofs v3 design.  There
are reasons why you really want to have a simple-minded timeout in the
kernel, mostly because attempting umount is more expensive than it
should be on some filesystems.  It only needs to be statistically
accurate, though, and thus it does not introduce a race.
Once you have to deal with mount trees (multiple filesystems on the same
mount point which you want to have appear to userspace as a unit),
things get significantly more complex, unfortunately.  Mounting is not a
problem, since the nonprivileged processes are simply held, but
umounting is, since in order to make sure there are no race conditions
userspace needs to be locked out from filesystem "a" while umounting
filesystem "a/b", *or* the equivalent of a direct mount autofs point has
to be imposed on node "a/b" of filesystem "a" which can be atomically
deleted together with the umounting of filesystem "a".
These are the mount traps Al Viro has been architecting.
