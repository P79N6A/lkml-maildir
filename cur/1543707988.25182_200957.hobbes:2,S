Well this is the complexity I'm talking about. Sure it
is actually "simpler" code wise, but you're making it
conceptually more complex.

Your slab wasn't being shrunk because the slab pressure
calculation was way off for highmem systems. My patch fixed
that, so lowmem pressure should shrink slab properly.
Then with your patch, highmem pressure will apply lowmem
pressure. So the end result is that the slab gets appropriate
pressure.
Can't you just prove to me why that doesn't work? ;)
