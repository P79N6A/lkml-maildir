Here is the -mm version. I examined the same test as -rc6.

Fix the return of the first time_slice
Currently exiting process takes back its first_time_slice to its
parent. If the task is created with CLONE_PARENT or CLONE_THREAD
flag, the parent is not the creator. Hence the creator can't
collect the time_slice and time_slice leak occurs.
To fix this problem, remove first_time_slice field of task_struct
and introduce time_slice_reaper field instead. The new field means
the task which exiting task should return its first_time_slice to,
and is NULL after exhausting its first time_slice.
