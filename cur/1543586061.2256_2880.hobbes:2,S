  Well, one solution to this on the long term comes quite naturally:
make major/minor separation a policy, i.e., as in network/host
IP numbers. That is, in addition to 32-bit dev_t there would
be a 32-bit devmask_t that when &-ed with dev_t would yield the
major. The default, for compatibility reasons will be devmask of 255
(or -1+1<<12). For example, all floppies would fall into 2/8 major
(using IP address notation). Obviously, all this is not advantageous
on the short term, but in the absence of better ideas, this can give
some flexibility when allocating/shifting to new majors/minors...Of
course, namespaces approach is even better, but when will all drivers
be converted to support them?
Cheers,
Pjotr
