Update suspend documentation. Warnings were a bit overstated, and did
not point out important stuff.

-From kernel/suspend.c:
+Some warnings, first.
 
  * BIG FAT WARNING *********************************************************
  *
- * If you have unsupported (*) devices using DMA...
- *				...say goodbye to your data.
- *
  * If you touch anything on disk between suspend and resume...
  *				...kiss your data goodbye.
  *
- * If your disk driver does not support suspend... (IDE does)
- *				...you'd better find out how to get along
- *				   without your data.
- *
- * If you change kernel command line between suspend and resume...
- *			        ...prepare for nasty fsck or worse.
+ * If you do resume from initrd after your filesystems are mounted...
+ *				...bye bye root partition.
+ *			[this is actually same case as above]
  *
- * If you change your hardware while system is suspended...
- *			        ...well, it was not good idea.
+ * If you have unsupported (*) devices using DMA, you may have some
+ * problems. If your disk driver does not support suspend... (IDE does),
+ * it may cause some problems, too. If you change kernel command line 
+ * between suspend and resume, it may do something wrong. If you change 
+ * your hardware while system is suspended... well, it was not good idea;
+ * but it wil probably only crash.
  *
  * (*) suspend/resume support is needed to make it safe.
