I recently was using randconfig to fish for some broken configs, when
I came to a .config[1], The failure appeared to be related to
CONFIGFS, so I mailed the maintainer, and was told CONFIGFS is
selected but SYSFS is not, and it shouldn't be possible unless edited
by hand which I didn't. Next, I forwarded the conversation to the
Kconfig maintainer, to where I was told it's not directly a Kconfig
problem. Anyone know which maintainer takes responsibility in this
area?
