	Using the patch mentioned above, 14 hours uptime and no BUG yet. more 
stress testing needed however before I can declare all is well.
	On an unrelated note, enabling lapic (tho my board doesn't seem to have 
an IO-APIC) causes some prefm/mdkkdm to not start properly.
	Also, w/ or w/o lapic, shutdown freezes on the stopping of CUPS. 
Everything is still alive, but CUPS never shuts down so I have to use 
SysRq-B to reboot.

they see it is easier than trading.  And it has its pleasures.  I feel 
it myself.  Like the hunt, but with richer rewards.
