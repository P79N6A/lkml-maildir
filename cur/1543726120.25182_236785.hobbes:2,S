Hello
Using kernel 2.6.7 with ipmi watchdog compiled in, I have noticed that
when the process writting to /dev/watchdog is killed (-9) the system is
not reset. When I query the BMC to list the SEL it does report:
   Watchdog 2 #0x03 | Timer expired
So the BMC does notice that the timer did expire but no action is taken.
What must I do so it resets my system?
Thanks,
Holger
