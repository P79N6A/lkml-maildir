Indeed, this is what my original changes for this did, before you started
cleaning things up to be nice to TF users other than PTRACE_SINGLESTEP. 
I note, btw, that the x86_64 code is still at that prior stage.  So I think
it doesn't have this new wrinkle, but it also doesn't have the advantages
of the more recent i386 changes.  Once we're sure about the i386 state, we
should update the x86_64 code to match.
I'm not sure what kind of smart this makes me, but I'll say that your plan
would work and no, it's obviously not the right thing to do. ;-) I haven't
tested the following, not having tracked down the specific problem case you
folks are talking about.  But I think this is the right solution.  The
difference is that when we stop for some signal and report to the debugger,
the debugger looking at our registers will see TF clear instead of set,
before it decides whether to continue us with the signal or what to do.
With the change yo suggested, (I think) if the debugger decides to eat the
signal and resume, we would get a spurious single-step trap after executing
the next instruction, instead of resuming normally as requested.
Thanks,
Roland
