So one thing I don't understand is the difference between CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G
and regular 32-bit. I always thought that 32 bit means 4GB address space
and that the HIGHMEM4G is using your above trick but with 32-bit dma_addr_t
since there is only actual 4GB of real memory and the rest is mapping tricks.
But I guess I was wrong.
The other point I was making is why use 36 bit trickery when you have a machine
that is capable of the full 64-bit, and runs much faster at that? Just a waste of
a good machine, wont you say? Perhaps we learn to use x86_64 ARCHs before Intel
fixes their BIOS, and they where right all along?
