I've known about this for a long time and wanted to apply a patch to the
kernel resolving this. The comment on the system call for getrusage
indicates that, after the current task structure gets kalloc'ed, we could
move more of the statistics into the task structure.
There is no one answer as to why some patches get approved while others
don't.
