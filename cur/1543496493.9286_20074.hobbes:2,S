Hi,
I'm seting up a Linux box in order to run a (apache) web server with
a very heavy load.
I want to increase the number of max processes and max open files.
What is the max limit for NR_TASKS ?
In the tasks.h there is said 4090 (kernel 2.2.9), but I've read here
something about problems with LDT, TSS and GDT.
What is LDT, TSS and GDT ?
Also, doing :
echo 4096 > /proc/sys/kernel/file-max
echo 12288 > /proc/sys/kernel/inode-max
echo 300 400 500 > /proc/sys/vm/freepages
is this the good method for having a very heavy network traffic ?
				Thanks,
					Flav
