With cvsbk rev 423b66b6oJOGN68OhmSrBFxxLOtIEA (rsynced Monday, it claims
to be "2.6.12-rc1"), the situation is much improved.  The AlpsPS/2
driver recognizes the trackpad, tracking speed is back to normal, and
tapping is turned on by default.  (Drat, now I need to figure out how to
turn that off again.)
The kernel output is a bit odd, though:
[ 1200.254707] Adding 987988k swap on /dev/hda3.  Priority:-1 extents:1
[ 1200.330453] EXT3 FS on hda2, internal journal

[ 1206.183165] kjournald starting.  Commit interval 5 seconds
Note how the "Enabling hardware tapping" message is several lines
earlier than it seems it should be... I don't think I'm supposed to be
tapping on my SCSI hardware.
... ah, I think I'm missing the "ALPS GlidePoint detected" message which
I used to get.  Without it, the "Enabling hardware tapping" message is a
bit opaque.
Other than that, I have no complaints about the trackpad.
Thanks for the ping.
