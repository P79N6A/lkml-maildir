The driver version that is included in the kernel (and has been patched a bit I'm sure since it's been in there a while) is version 2.09. The latest version (3.08 beta) can be obtained from: 
the easiest way is to get diff -u 2.09 3.08 and port it by hand, at least I
ususally do it this way.

Convert to pci probing and in-kernel firmware loading :). The code is big mess
due to ifdefs and much unneeded material, it's likely impossible to say this is
wrong and this not, if you won't post a patch, where people will see the changes
you want to make. Then you will have feedback :).
