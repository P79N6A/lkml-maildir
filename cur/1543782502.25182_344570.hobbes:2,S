Cpio is perhaps as available as tar, but it's not as used as tar.
Unless tar would be inordinately larger than a cpio implementation
(I can't imagine, but I'm not a coder!) I would prefer it.

If initramfs replaces the old initrd method it should have something
as a filesystem that's robust and inspires confidence like ext2.
I know generally an initrd is used to load modules and prepare
the installation of a Linux system, so it doesn't require much
in a filesystem.
But, it can also be used to hold and run a complete Linux system,
so a more robust filesystem (tmpfs) is useful.
