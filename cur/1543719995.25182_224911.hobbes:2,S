At 255 pending requests (see above), it will get somewhat bad. So even
if 2.4 copes, it will spend more sys time than 2.6 for this work load
for sure. The queues will get long even for mainly contig submissions,
but of course the time spent in the io scheduler will not be too bad
since it's scanned backwards. And call frequency will be 32 times as
big...
