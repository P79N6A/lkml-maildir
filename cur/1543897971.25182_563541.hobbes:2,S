What about if someone kfree()'s that object meanwhile?
Can we bump the SLAB object count just like we can a page?
That's basically what's happening in the stuff Jens is
working on, he needs to grab a reference to a SLAB
object just like one can a page.  Even if there is an
intervening kfree (like a put_page()) the SLAB object is
still live until all the references are put, and thus it
can't get reallocated and given to another client by SLAB.
