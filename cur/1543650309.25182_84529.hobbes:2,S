David,
     Please consider pulling from:
kernel.bkbits.net:/home/acme/net-2.5
     This is to just flush my tree, I have confirmed the crash when
using cat /proc/net/llc/core after psnap.o is loaded, will be fixing it,
have not confirmed the crash using cat /proc/net/arp, will try it again
in a different test case tho.
