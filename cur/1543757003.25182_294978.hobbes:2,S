Subject: my bk-pci and bk-driver trees are back up

Could you put my bk-pci and bk-driver trees back into the next -mm
releases?  They are at:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/pci-2.6
and
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/driver-2.6
Respectively.  I've pluled the 64bit resource stuff out of the pci tree,
that was causing a lot of problems.  It's in a separate bk tree for now
(at: bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/resource-2.6 if anyone cares).
I've also pulled out the pm changes from my driver tree that were
causing the merge issues before, as I see Pavel has started to split
them up better.
For those who want to see patches of this stuff, big ones can be found
