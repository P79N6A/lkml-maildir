In the larger picture I'm not completely happy with these scalibilty 
patches, as they add extra overhead at the lower end. On a UP system in 
general nothing beats:
	spin_lock();
	if (*ptr)
		ptr += 1;
	spin_unlock();
The main problem is here that the atomic functions are used in two basic 
situation:
1) interrupt synchronization
2) multiprocessor synchronization
The atomic functions have to assume both, but on UP systems it often is 
a lot cheaper if they don't have to synchronize with interrupts. So 
replacing a spinlock with a few atomic operations can hurt UP performance.
bye, Roman
