That looks OK except for
	* jffs2 is b0rken (see patch in another mail)
	* afs, autofs4, befs, devfs, freevxfs, jffs2, jfs, ncpfs, procfs,
smbfs, sysvfs, ufs, xfs - prototype change for ->follow_link()
	* befs, smbfs, xfs - same for ->put_link()
	* ncpfs fix is actually missing here
Prototype changes are covered by patch below (incremental on top of your +
jffs2 fix upthread).  No ncpfs changes - these will go separately, assuming
you haven't done them yet; just a plain janitor stuff.
