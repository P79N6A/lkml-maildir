Hmm. My Mac Mini doesn't restore properly even with it, but I suspect it's 
the old DRM "resume AGP in the wrong order" problem.
When trying to verify that, though, I noticed that if I enable the "keep 
console active over suspend", then it won't even suspend. It hangs after 
printing "i801_smbus 0000:00:1f.3: suspend".
I'm wondering what Pavel does for debugging these things, since the claim 
was that keeping printk() active would make debugging easier. As it is, it 
just seems to break suspend exactly because it wants to access devices 
that are turned off.
Pavel?
