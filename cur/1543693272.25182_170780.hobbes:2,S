Ok now I'm confused. The .config you posted earlier stated that
you had both UP_APIC and APM_DISPLAY_BLANK enabled. Your dmesg
log indicates that you're running on a 1.6GHz Athlon-XP, but
there's no mention of APIC anything in the dmesg log.
So either your Athlon has had its local APIC disabled, or you
changed the .config to exclude UP_APIC.
In any case, APM_DISPLAY_BLANK is known to sometimes lock up when it
blanks the console (e.g., when X exists). This is because some graphics
card BIOSen can't handle local APIC interrupts (e.g., the timer).
The workaround is to disable either APM_DISPLAY_BLANK or UP_APIC.
