I will double-check with the CPU folks, but I don't think this
will do what you want it to do. If you send an NMI IPI with
destination set to 0xff, I think it will interrupt all CPUs,
including the non-started CPUs in the cli;hlt state. If I
remember right, the destination shorthand method simply
sends the interrupt on the bus with destination set to
0xff..
