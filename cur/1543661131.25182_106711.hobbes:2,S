Exactly the problem.
What's more is that fs/proc/kcore.c:get_kcore_size() also breaks, so
this isn't an acceptable solution.  get_kcore_size wants the module
region to be above PAGE_OFFSET.
In order to place the module in the normal vmalloc space, we end up with
a chicken and egg problem - we need to scan the module from kernel space
to find out how large to make the jump table, but we can't because the
module hasn't been loaded into kernel memory - this is the reason why it
was suggested to go down this route.
