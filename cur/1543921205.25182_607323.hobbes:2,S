I'd love to see this converted to use the GPIO API before all the
drivers are going in.
Any chance we can use this as an opportunity to look at David
Brownell's gpiolib again? (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/15/127
).
I want to do the same for a similar chip (a GPIO/IRQ extender
implemented in a Xilinx CPLD used on several HTC phones), but I
couldn't figure out how to do GPIO<->IRQ conversion properly with
gpiolib and how to handle the CPU's internal GPIOs, which are more
than ARCH_GPIOS_PER_CHIP in gpiolib.
