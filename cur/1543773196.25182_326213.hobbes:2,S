You can set up a serial console and capture the output.
I would also recommend booting with pci=routeirq, this will show the
pre-disposition of each GSI->IRQ pair, although sometimes it changes IRQ
distribution, and you may get different error. Also try using apic=debug
or acpi=verbose to see the IO-APIC lines setup. For debug failed IRQs, I
sometimes insert print_io_APIC() after each PCI device IRQ registration,
to see it got edge or level triggered and other details. 
The other one that I saw causing problems especially for ISA devices is
ACPI PnP (and still does, I'm researching a similar problem on ES7000),
and in this case I get my system booted with pnpacpi=off.
Thanks,
