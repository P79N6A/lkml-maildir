And S4BIOS will never get added to 2.4 since it needs driver model
:-(.

We have full control over S4 (== swsusp), so we can fix that in most
cases.
S4BIOS is still little friendlier to the user -- no need to set up
swap partition and command line parameter, can't go wrong if you boot
without resume=, etc.
