I agree with this line of thinking.  The various academics studying
geology have been warning California about "The Big One" for years now,
and no one seems to care anymore.  
I don't think anyone's being lazy and I certainly don't have the
information to comment on the size of their butts.  So I'd rather just
assume they were working very hard on other things (like getting TPC-H
benchmarks to run!)
