Harrumph.  Those analogies sound good but aren't a very good guide.
Let's take a concrete example.  Consider the following fragment of a
policy for Mozilla:
    allow ~/.mozilla
    deny ~
Ignore the syntax; the goal is to allow Mozilla to access files under
~/.mozilla but nothing else under my home directory.  This is a perfectly
reasonable policy fragment to want to enforce.  And enforcing it in
the obvious way using pathname-based access control is not a ridiculous
thing to do.
Yes, in theory, there could always be crazy symlinks or hardlinks
from somewhere under ~/.mozilla to elsewhere in my home directory that
would cause this policy to behave in ways different from how I desired.
In theory.  But in practice this is "pretty good": good enough to be
useful in the real world.  In the real world I don't have any symlinks
like that under my ~/.mozilla directory, and I'm not really worried
about unconfined processes accidentally creating a symlink under there
against my wishes.  It'd be good enough for me.
Yes, pathname-based models have limitations and weaknesses, but don't
overplay them.  For some purposes they are a very simple way of specifying
a desired policy and they work well enough to be useful -- a darn site
better than what we've got today.  If your goal is "ease of use" and
"better than what many users are using today", it's not an unreasonable
approach.  Time will tell whether it's the best solution, but it's not
obviously wrong.
And I think that's the criteria: If you want to argue that the very
idea of pathname-based access control so bogus that no approach to
pathname-based security should be merged, then you should have to argue
that it is obviously wrong and obviously not useful to users.  I don't
think that burden has been met.
>B. Pathname access control as a general abstraction for OS security.
This strikes me as a strawman.  Pathname-based access control is an
abstraction for mediating the *filesystem*.  Who says it has to be the
way you mediate the network or IPC?

You bet.  The claim you quote is totally bogus.
Bad marketers, no biscuit for you.

Disagree.

Based on my experience with Janus, my expectation is the policy isn't
going to get that much more complicated when they add mediation of
network and IPC access.  I suspect it will stay almost as simple.
