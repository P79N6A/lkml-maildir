It's not IDE specific, since when does IDE use packet commands? It's
not ATAPI specific either.

It's meant to be an example of a generic prep_rq_fn() queue function, a
start the conversion of using struct request as the generic passer of
cdb's. Only ide-cd uses it for now as you see, that's merely because
lots of bits of the infrastructure are still missing.
