First, look at /usr/src/linux/.config  . Make certain that no
DEC Alpha stuff is enabled. Here is an example.
#
# Video For Linux
#
# CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV is not set
# CONFIG_DTLK is not set
# CONFIG_R3964 is not set
# CONFIG_APPLICOM is not set
#
# ONLY for DEC Alpha architectures
#
CONFIG_FT_ALPHA_CLOCK=0
# CONFIG_DRM is not set
# CONFIG_DRM_TDFX is not set
#
# Console drivers
#
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y
# CONFIG_VIDEO_SELECT is not set
Next if Video BIOS shadow is enabled, at least temporarily turn it off.
Actually if any BIOS shadow is enabled, turn it off. the BIOS is
only used during boot so any shadowing will do nothing once Linux is
up except waste RAM which Linux could be using.
Cheers,
