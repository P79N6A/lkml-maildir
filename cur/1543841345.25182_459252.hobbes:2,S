Yep, see -EINVAL below.

From: Keith Mannthey <kmannth@us.ibm.com>
This patch set allow SPARSEMEM and RESERVE based hot-add to work.  I have
test both options and they work as expected.  I am adding memory to the
2nd node of a numa system (x86_64).
Major changes from last set is the config change and RESERVE enablment.
This patch:
Make ACPI motherboard driver not attach to devices/handles it dosen't expect.
Fix a bug where the motherboard driver attached to hot-add memory event and
caused the add memory call to fail.
