I will scratch your new patch too.
I want to see the code to handle the apparent VIA DMA bug. At this point,
preferably by just disabling DMA on VIA chipsets or something like that
(if it has only gotten worse since 2.2.x, I'm not interested in seeing any
experimental patches for it during early 2.4.x).
We've already had one major fs corruption due to this, I want that fixed
_first_.
