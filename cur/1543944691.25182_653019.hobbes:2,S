Hi Peter,
I've been trying to reproduce the latencies, and the worst I have
managed only 80ms. At an average I am getting around 60 ms. This is with
a make -j4 as root, and dhaval running other programs. (with maxcpus=1).

I know I am missing something, but aren't we trying to reduce latencies
here?
