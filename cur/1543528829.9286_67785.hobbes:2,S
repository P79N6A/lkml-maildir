The current implementation of /dev/zero shared memory is to treat the
mapping as similarly as possible to a shared memory segment. The common
code handles the swap cache interactions, and both cases qualify as shared
anonymous mappings. While its not well tested, in theory it should work. 
We are currently agonizing over how to integrate the /dev/zero code with 
shmfs patch.
