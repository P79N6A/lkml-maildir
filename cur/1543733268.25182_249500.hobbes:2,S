Hi,
    This is completely wrong. Neither KDE people hate GNOME people
    nor viceversa.
    Time ago, I repeat in a conference the GNOME people need to jump
    on the KDE wagon, so the train will move to a single direction, and
    people does not approve this comment.
    More than on the license, QPL, there are a developer problem.
    Develop in C (Gtk, GNOME) is a lot more easy than develop in C++ 
(Qt, KDE)
    But, for the GUI, the C++ approach is a lot superior ... a lot.
    The problem is this. They start to develop on Gtk to create GNOME, in C
    for a license problem.
    Now, they said why I need to change?
    But they need to change, because it is supeiror. Everyone may of 
course wants to do what prefer.

I don't agree FreeDesktop.org, because it is handled by a RedHat employee
and the code is made on Gtk2, generally.
... They are not neutral.
Thanks,
