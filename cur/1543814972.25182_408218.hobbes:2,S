Subject: Re: [PATCH] unshare: Cleanup up the sys_unshare interface before we are committed.

The unshare() syscall is in fact a clone() syscall minus one
CLONE_* flag that is normally implied: CLONE_TASK_STRUCT.
(conceptually -- it has no name because it is always implied)
We already have one flag with inverted action: CLONE_NEWNS.
Adding another such flag (for the task struct) makes sense.
The new system call is thus not needed at all.
Suggested names: CLONE_NO_TASK, CLONE_SAMETASK, CLONE_SHARETASK
