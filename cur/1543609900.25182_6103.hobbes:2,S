this is a VM bug, not a bttv bug.
One simple fix is to replace __free_page(page) in unmap_kiobuf with
page_cache_release(page). that will cure it.
But a better fix that I probably prefer for robusteness is to change in
page_alloc.c __free_pages with page_cache_release, so that we always do
this:
		if (PageLRU(page))
			lru_cache_del(page);
while freeing pages.
