The following is included near-verbatim (reformatted) from a hugetlb
feature request made of me. The request is perfectly reasonable and
represents fixing what could probably be called a bug.
Apologies to Guy if cc:'ing on lkml threads is too verbose for him
(there is at least an autoresponder, but hopefully that gets filtered).
akpm, please apply.
