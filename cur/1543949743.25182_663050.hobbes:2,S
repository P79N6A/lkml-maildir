Sorry for delay.  I'm really not sure.  The maintainer of ndiswrapper  
is currently offline, and I'm just trying to take care of the basic  
stuff.
All I can say is NdisMAllocateSharedMemory maps to  
dma_alloc_coherent(), and there are some references to scatter-gather  
lists.  There is a call to dma_map_single(), which is ultimately  
called by the Tx function net_dev->hard_start_xmit.
I understand there is some control from NDIS.  At least it can request  
memory available for DMA.

It's possible that ndiswrapper would support Vista drivers only on  
x86_64, which should always have IOMMU, if I understand correctly.   
But it would be nice to have proper support for older XP drivers on x86.
