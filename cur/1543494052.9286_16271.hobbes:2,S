Still, it would make a heck of a lot more sense to sue Microsoft.  It's
their OS that was open to attack.  I have a Windows 95 computer and I
didn't receive any mail from them on it, either directly or through the
hardware vendor, but they must have known about it for months.  (I
didn't have a problem with it. Those who did need to sue.) 
That the OS is notoriously exposed is the only reason why the anti-virus
vendors even exist.  On Linux it could only have happened to a clueless
kid (or granddad) who did everything as root.
