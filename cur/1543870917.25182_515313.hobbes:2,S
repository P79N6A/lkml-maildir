The lockup is happening inside the call to device_move(),
specifically in sysfs_move_dir() it loops here forever:
...
again:
        mutex_lock(&old_parent_dentry->d_inode->i_mutex);
        if (!mutex_trylock(&new_parent_dentry->d_inode->i_mutex)) {
                mutex_unlock(&old_parent_dentry->d_inode->i_mutex);
                goto again;
        }
...
