Perhaps a new field in the xfs_buf structure - that way call paths
don't need to grow extra parameters and potentially increase
stack usage. The read path tends to be at the top of the stack
when it gets blown in the writeback path....

I don't want to have to introduce a mempool just for one xfs_buf per
filesystem, so this would need to be able to take a xfs_buf (log->l_xbuf)
that it clones to....
