Argh.
We'd better have the rule that if there are any virtual caches or other
issues, then the "canonical address" had better be the _only_ address (or
at least any virtual remapping has to be done in such a way that it never
causes aliasing or other performance problems with the canonical address).
This is already turning fairly ugly, and I just don't want to see even 
more ugly rules like "you can't mix direct accesses with pointer accesses"
