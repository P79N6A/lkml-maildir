It seems to me that "st_ino/st_dev tuple always maps to the same file" 
is equivalent to "different st_ino/st_dev pairs will always identify 
different files".  What is the distinction between the two statements?
As I see it, the main question is whether it is a unique mapping *at one 
specific point in time*, or is it a unique mapping *for the duration of 
the system*?  Note that in this case "system" includes "parts of the 
tree that may be remotely mounted from other machines on the network".
I would suggest that the spec doesn't specify the duration of the unique 
mapping, and thus as long as there is a unique mapping *at any 
particular point in time*, then there is no conflict.
If we read it as requiring a unique mapping for the duration of the 
system, consider a hypothetical "system" that includes all the devices 
of all the computers on the planet, and they are all dynamically 
appearing and disappearing continuously.  Consider the technical 
challenge in ensuring that each file on this hypothetical system is 
permanently and uniquely identified by a device/inode pair.
