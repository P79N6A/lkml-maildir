Policies are not the answer.  Using such a flag is no big issue.  *Iff*
we should end up with some form of private file descriptors changing the
default for them would be OK, too.  But the existing semantics mustn't
be touched, even if it is selectable.  Trying to fix existing buggy code
this way is foolish since it might just as well break assumptions in the
same program.
