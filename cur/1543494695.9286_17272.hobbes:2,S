Yep.  However, notice that these swap cache pages can be reclaimed with
no cost except for the performance cost, so it's not unreasonable to
think that at some point we might free them automatically if swap gets
low.  That somewhat defeats the purpose of doing the caching, but it's
better than swapping to death and should still be considered an
error cleanup condition.
