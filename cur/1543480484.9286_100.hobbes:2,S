I guess newer kernels are just more strict about allowing access to
irqs than older ones were.
I had the setserial command (for changing the irq of the terminal port)
placed at the end of rc.local.  By the time it was reached during the
boot process, the modem was dialing already, and the kernel therefore
denied setserial access to any device at irq 3 (where it believed the
modem and the terminal port to both reside).  Getty started anyway, and
just respawned indefinitely.  Somewhere along the way, the modem
connection was cut, and the kernel handed irq 3 over to the getty for
the terminal.  That made the modem unavailable, hence the sudden "device
or resource busy" for the attempts to redial.
I created /etc/rc.d/rc.serial and put the setserial command in there,
rather than in /etc/rc.d/rc.local.  Now, setserial runs before the modem
dials.  The irq is wide open at the time, so it is successfully changed.
Everything works.
