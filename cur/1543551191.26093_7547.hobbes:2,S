Not completely sure.  I _think_ the problem was that when the kernel was
switching from your SCHED_FIFO process to some other process, and an
interrupt occurred between the reenabling of interrupts and the
switch_to() in schedule(), and that interrupt tried to wake the
SCHED_FIFO process, it wasn't noticed until the next timeslice.  That
was as far as I got when the problem magically disappeared.  Due to
this hunk:
        switch_to(prev, next, prev);
        __schedule_tail(prev);
same_process:
        reacquire_kernel_lock(current);
+       if (current->need_resched)
+               goto tq_scheduler_back;
        return;

Is it not a matter of:
a): checking need_resched after the call to do_signal() and
b): disabling local interrupts prior to the final need_resched
    check to make this test atomic wrt interrupts.  RESTORE_ALL
    will do the right thing and an intervening smp_send_reschedule()
    will be blocked until the return to user space.
Seems too simple...
