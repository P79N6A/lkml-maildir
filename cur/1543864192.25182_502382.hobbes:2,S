Probably not. I could publish a qemu i386 image with all cross compilers
though. But some are not build from source but are obtained from more or
less obscure sources (m32r, sh64). Currently this
 CHK     include/linux/utsrelease.h
"2.6.20-rc6cat:include/config/kernel.release:Nosuchfileordirectory" exceeds 64 characters
make[1]: *** [include/linux/utsrelease.h] Error 1
make: *** [_all] Error 2
bug, which I reported weeks ago, makes the result invalid for most
archs. But as I get nearly zero feedback about the results and I've
lots of other obligations currently, my motivation to work on that is
pretty much nil.
