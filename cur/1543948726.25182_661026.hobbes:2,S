Just to clarify: sleep here means a call to some blocking syscall
(e.g., nanosleep(), read(), select(), etc.), right?  Is there anything
else that falls under the category of "sleep"?  What about a call to
sched_yield() where the process explicitly lets go of the CPU?
Also, is this limit per-thread or per-process?  I assume the latter --
but can you confirm please.
Cheers,
Michael
