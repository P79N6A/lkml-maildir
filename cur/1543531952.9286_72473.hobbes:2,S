As I understand it, Linux Threads are implemented using clone() so that
each thread is actually a separate process, and since the pid is not
cloned, each thread also has a unique pid.  In all my former lives of
non-Unix OS'es, all the threads of a process actually lived in the process
and by definition shared the pid.  Is there a way to obtain the main
process' pid from a thread (without maintaining my own state)?  I can't use
getppid, because the parent process of a thread apparently is the manager
thread.
Thanks!
