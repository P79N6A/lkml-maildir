Hi,
I have two machines, one pentium 200 notebook and a workstation with AMD K6
350. Otherwise both machines have identical software installed. All went
well up to the latest 4 or 5 development kernels. 
Now I am experiencing a problem. If I compile 2.3.24 (for instance) on my
notebook it runs well on both machines. However, compiling it on the K6 it
doesn't even start on any of the two. It just tells me it's booting. The
Linux version entry does not show up.
I have no idea if it really has to do with my hardware but it's hard to
imagine any other reason. BTW I am using gcc 2.95.2. I could very well
imagine that this is a gcc related bug.
Michael
P.S.: Please CC me on replies.
