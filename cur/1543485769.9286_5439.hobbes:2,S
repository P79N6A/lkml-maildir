Got this wierd message from 2.2.2-pre2 today when copying a file over
to a zip drive:

Now 08:09 is my hd /home partition.
I sync'ed the disks with the sync command and redid the copy and the
message was gone !
This was on:
Linux ceramic 2.2.2-pre2 #6 SMP Sun Feb 7 01:40:48 PST 1999 i686 unknown
with the synchronous pty hangup patch Linus circulated on the lists
circa one week ago.
