You can use large pages in your application by mmaping
from a file in hugetlbfs and configuring large pages using sysctl.

It probably wouldn't because Opteron has much more 4K DTLB entries
than 2M DTLB entries. I have had people trying the opposite from
what you tried (using 4K pages for the kernel instead of 2MB),
but that also doesn't work right now.
