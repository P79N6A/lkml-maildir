Subject: Problem with new driver model?

When testing the drivers I maintain on 2.5.20, I hit the
BUG_ON in include/linux/devices.txt:115.
This is in get_driver() which is called in a chain from:
driver_for_each_dev()
driver_unbind()
do_driver_unbind()
free_module()
sys_delete_module()
This occurs when unloading the modules (rmmod).
This was not the case on 2.5.14 (the last kernel I tested).
The machine is an SMP dual PentiumII-400.
A reading of Documentation/driver-model.txt indicates that
changes were made to the global driver model that should not require
changes to individual device specific drivers.
Is the documentation correct and this is a bug with the
new driver model code, or are there changes required for
all the device specific drivers.
Thanks,
Paul Fulghum
