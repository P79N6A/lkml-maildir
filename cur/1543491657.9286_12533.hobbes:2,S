Dear Colleagues
I am here again with more questions.
At this time my subject is: creation and termination process.
QUESTION: Where did these procedures start??
I mean ...Which is the first function called in both procedures?? 
I am trying to understand the sequence of functions used in both procedures.
I know that the main functions are do_fork and do_exit, respectively. However I could not trace all the behaviour.
I would like to determine the exact point where a process is started and ended. I mean...the instant where the kernel realize that a process is started and ended.
Once more...thanks.
Best regards,
Livia Catarina.
