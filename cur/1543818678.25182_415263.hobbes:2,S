At home I'm behind a Linux gateway box currently running 2.6.15-rc6 - I 
am connected through ethernet to that.
At my student house I am connected wirelessly to a Linksys WRT54Gv5 
router (the model that doesnt run Linux).
I have reproduced it at both those locations (same ISP).
This is very familiar, and I just found the article I was thinking of: 
http://lwn.net/Articles/92727/
I was also hit by that bug, on the same collection of websites, but that 
particular problem was fixed for 2.6.8 or so. So I guess it is extremely 
likely that my ISP has broken routers. nmap isn't able to identify the 
OS of any ISP routers in my path.
It's a huge ISP over here, so contacting them over technical matters is 
not easy...
Thanks,
Daniel
