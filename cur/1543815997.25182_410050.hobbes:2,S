A compelling argument? Launch UT2004 and some applications in the background.
They'll get swapped out. Shock horror when you wait x seconds before system 
gets responsive and applications are swapped in. (especially the new manual 
option helps)
Same applies to any large compile. (KDE with --enable-final springs to mind, 
but Firefox should also be large enough)
Even 0,5G of memory is not enough for those and a few apps.
Another boon is retaining swapped-out data.
Saves a lot of time when I keep large applications in background and only use 
them sporadically. (OpenOffice springs to mind)
