Are your xruns showing the same type of latency?  If you switch to the
1000Hz do you get only 1mS latency on your xruns too?  This sounds like
the application might have gone to sleep and didn't wake up until
something scheduled it in.  Or something else with the scheduler.  I doubt
that this has to due with preemption or interrupts being off, but
something that uses jiffies to calculate.
