Subject: [PATCH] x86_64 - Fix FS/GS registers for VT execution
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Andi, as we discussed, FS/GS segment state doesn't allow VT execution 
during boot.  Patch fixes this problem.  Please apply.  I will be 
sending for -stable review when upstream.
Thanks,
Zach
Initialize FS and GS to __KERNEL_DS as well.  The actual value of them is not
important, but it is important to reload them in protected mode.  At this time,
they still retain the real mode values from initial boot.  VT disallows
execution of code under such conditions, which means hardware virtualization
can not be used to boot the kernel on Intel platforms, making the boot time
painfully slow.
This requires moving the GS load before the load of GS_BASE, so just move
all the segments loads there to keep them together in the code.
