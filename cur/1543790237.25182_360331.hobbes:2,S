For what I see, that's based on the tradeoff between space and contention - 
for instance there are few zones only, so there's no big waste. In practice, 
interpreting !X86_GENERIC as "I will run this kernel on _this_ processor" 
could also be done.
However, in case you didn't note, max_align is never enough on EM64T 
currently, right?
