Is it careless to asume good code quality for default options?
Does the 4K stack come with a big red warning about crashing the kernel?
(I just checked, it does not, only benefits are listed.)
Are 4K stacks so obviously flawed nobody would use them for reliable systems?
Or is each sysadmin supposed to read LKML in order to find out about the
pitfalls you designed for them?
