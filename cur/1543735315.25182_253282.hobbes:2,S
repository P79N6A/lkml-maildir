Currently bttv/cx88 and DVB in general get more and more interwoven.
I have been waiting for Gerd to submit his latest bttv patches, so I can 
send off my DVB patches.
Gerd's latest patch depends on my not-yet-submitted patches, so just 
simply drop this one. Gerd and I are going to coordinate this and 
resubmit it again. Ok, Gerd?
CU
Michael.
