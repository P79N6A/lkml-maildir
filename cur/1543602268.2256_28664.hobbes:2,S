If the problem happens under ext2 as well, it is not a journal_revoke BUG
(or at least it shouldn't be...).  Can you post the OOPS output (after
running it through ksymoops of course) WHEN RUNNING WITH EXT2.  It may be
that there is a bug lurking somewhere else also, and you just happen to
be lucky enough to find both.
Cheers, Andreas
