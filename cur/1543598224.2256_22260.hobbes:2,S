After all of this theory it was time to do some experiments. I modified 
the BIOS on my current PowerPC system to compare memory against a test 
pattern (I chose 0x31415926 incrementing by 0x27182817) over the address 
range 0x0 to 0x100000. This pattern has approximately 50% 1s and 50% 0s.
On pressing the reset button, I got 100% of bits holding the same value. 
If I turn the power off for 20s, I get approximately 90% of bits holding 
the same value. After a minute, it's dropped to the 50% level, which I 
take as random.
For added fun, I then tried turning off, pulling out the DIMM, plugging 
it into the other slot, and turning back on. 97% of the bits had the 
original value. So one attack we must consider is the attacker removing 
power, ripping the DIMM out, and plugging it into a special DIMM reading 
device.
Your descriptions on how memory is started look very machine specific. 
On mine (Motorola MPC107) I write the number of row bits, column bits, 
and internal banks to the memory controller, along with the CAS latency. 
I then set MEMGO, and the memory controller precharges each bank.
