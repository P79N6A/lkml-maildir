By the way, the driver emits custom uevent when the new card is detected. I was going to look at
this some day in the future, but if you want to mess a little with hotplug scripts the issue can
be easily solved.
As I already said before, many of the complications exist because this is  an universal adapter,
and memorystick support is quite near in the queue. A good hotplug script will, therefore, look at
the "TIFM_CARD_TYPE" event var and load the appropriate media driver.
