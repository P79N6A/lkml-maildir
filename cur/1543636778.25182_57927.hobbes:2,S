Another option would be to convert pgdats to using list.h, which would
make things even prettier IMHO. After wrapping the list iterations it's
actually not difficult to swizzle the list linkage out from underneath.
And yes, s/pgdat/physcontig_region/ or whatever would make the name
match the intended usage.
