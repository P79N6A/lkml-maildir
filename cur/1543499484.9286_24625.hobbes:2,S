ANYTHING could be a cabling problem.
Let me retell the story of the disk which worked absolutely flawlessly,
except that it failed to correctly store one specific tar.gz file.
It was traced, after a few weeks, to the disk's data cable -- which wasn't
plugged in all the way.
Ouch.

It is only too easy to make suggestions and later try to escape the
