Obviously, I don't agree with providing DSM and distributed locks,
because they are slow. Locks and SHM are defined to be fast. Creating
slow implementations is contrary to their intention.
But I can leave that aside, since it's your code, even though I
disagree with it's appropriateness. What I strongly object to is the
bloat that is added to the kernel to support your model. If DIPC was
limited to extending message queues to the cluster, I would be less
concerned (although I feel it should be possible from user space).

I don't give a stuff about what is "politically correct". I care more
about reason and practicality. Semaphores are more heavywheight than
mutexes, so should be used only when needed. FYI: I use both in my
code. Usually I use a mutex, because that's all I need, but I'm not
too proud to use a semaphore when appropriate.
And besides, semaphores and mutexes are both "locks".
Please explain what is wrong with mutexes, anyway?

An MPI programme is also MP-ready, but doesn't encourage constructs
which are heavily penalised in a cluster. Thus MPI programmes written
for SMP or DM machines (with fast interprocessor connections) should
scale well to a cluster.

Again: I'm all for abstractions that make life easier. But DSM makes
people think the *wrong way* about distributed computing.
Why not implement the MPI API for Linux instead? That would be useful
for a lot of people?

I'm not paid to write this code. So that knocks that theory out of the
water. And I've written my own API to abstract things, showing I'm not
against abstraction. There goes another theory.

And CS is littered with endless "ideas" which were dropped because
they didn't work in real life. People moved on from those
discussions. It cuts both ways.
