Subject: [PATCH 2.6.25-rc2 1/9] init: Improve init/Kconfig help	descriptions part 1
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/20/595

Rewrite the help descriptions for clarity, accuracy and consistency.
The problems I can see with the supplied help descriptions fall into
these areas:
  - Uses arcane terminology which only kernel developers can understand
  - Inconsistently describes safe response (if unsure, ...)
  - References out-of-date external resources (404 error)
  - Description has not kept pace with recent kernel changes or standards
  - Poor grammar or layout.
My approach to improving the descriptions is to go through each option
checking the correctness of the description, validating any references
it makes, finding inconsistency with the rest of the kernel config,
and trying to improve the usefulness of the explanation. I want to
end up with:
  1 - Single sentence summary of what the option does
  2 - Explain terminology or situation if necessary and possible, linking
  to validated information sources (Documentation directory, manpages,
  scripts, URLs, Wikipedia)
  3 - Suggest safe answer for people who just don't know what to do.
Kernel config options affected:
  - EXPERIMENTAL
  - LOCALVERSION
  - LOCALVERSION_AUTO
  - SWAP
  - SYSVIPC
  - POSIX_MQUEUE
  - BSD_PROCESS_ACCT
  - BSD_PROCESS_ACCT_V3
