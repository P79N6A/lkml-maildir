Correct, ATAPI isn't supported yet.

Correct.  For PATA, the code does not yet do 40/80-conductor cable
detection.  Without that detection, it's not safe to drive a PATA device
faster than UDMA/33.

Yeah, SATA doesn't need to worry about PATA cable detection 
issues :)
Both ATAPI and PATA cable detection should be working in the next
release (a week or two from now).
