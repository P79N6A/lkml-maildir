This stuff is *very* clear and your patch make it even more so!
Thanks!

In this UP case, what happenned to the named lock?  That was the
interesting part.
Now, in retrocomputing, what do I use in 2.0.38?  I am supporting code
with compiler directives to support 3 major kernel versions.  There is
no text in the 'Documentation' directory, except for file locks.  I
have found include/asm/locks.h and include/asm/semaphore.h and am
looking for examples in the code.
