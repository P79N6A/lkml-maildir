I'm not sure what you mean.
The moment you modified it, it would no longer be the GPL and, as long
as it's not the FSF publishing it as later version of the GPL, it
wouldn't be bound by the public commitment that all versions of the
GPL would have the same spirit, and as long as it's not the FSF
publishing it, it wouldn't be bound by the FSF's public mission and
the copyright assignments it received.
