I didn't benchmark, but how much lunch is left? UFS_DIRHASH was
introduced into FreeBSD by Ian Dowse a year ago (released in FreeBSD
4.4), and activated in FreeBSD 4.5's generic table. In case you missed
that, FreeBSD 4.6 is out since about four weeks.
options         UFS_DIRHASH             #Improve performance on big directories

http://www.freebsd.org/releases/4.5R/relnotes-i386.html#AEN250
http://www.cnri.dit.ie/Downloads/Malone_2001_bsdcon.pdf
The latter document by David Malone (November 2001) claims "MH 33 k
files create: 70s to 2.5s, pack: 240s to 2.5s, rm: 4.7s to 2s."
So might be ext3fs comes just in time for dessert, or is htree so much
faster than UFS_DIRHASH?
