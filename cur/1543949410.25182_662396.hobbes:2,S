I think this can be simplified by folding the logic into 
register_security(), rather than having a two-stage LSM registration 
process.
So, this function would now look like
	int register_security(ops, *status);
and set *status to LSM_WAS_CHOSEN (or similar) if the module being 
registered was also chosen via the security= parameter.  If there is no 
value for the parameter, the first module to register is automatically 
chosen, to preserve existing behavior.
The calling code can then decide what to do, e.g. not panic if 
registration failed and the LSM was not chosen; panic on failure when it 
was chosen.

I'd suggest getting rid of this atomic and using a spinlock to protect the 
global chosen_lsm string, which is always filled when an LSM registers.

You should never need to set the last byte to NULL -- it's initialized to 
that and by definition should never be overwritten.

Lack of ops->name during registration needs to be a BUG_ON.
