It's not that hard or inefficient to return the ENOSPC from the usual
point.  For example, make a gross overestimate of the space needed for
the write, compare to a cached filesystem free space value less the
amount deferred so far, and fail to take the optimization if it looks
even close.  Also, it's not necessarily bad to defer the ENOSPC to file
close time.  The same thing can happen with failed disk io, and that's
just a fact of life with asynchronous io.  A reliable program needs to
be able to deal with it.  (I think there was a long thread on this not
long ago, regarding filesystem errors returned after a program exits.)

Another nicety is not having to bother the filesystem at all about
sequences of short writes.

You'd most likely be able to measure the overhead under load of doing
the allocation twice, due to the occasional need to read back a
swapped-out metadata block.
XFS does deferred allocation and the Reiser guys are talking about it -
it seems to be something worth doing.  For me the question is, if the
VFS can already do the deferring, is there a good reason for a
filesystem to duplicate that functionality?
