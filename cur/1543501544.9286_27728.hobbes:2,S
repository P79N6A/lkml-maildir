Nope.

Maybe. It ought to be fun at least. It might help with NT compatibility.
If you need a file type, I've been collecting a list:
hex  name     ls octal  description
0000             000000 BSD unknown type (not used for inode)
1000 S_IFIFO  p| 010000 fifo (named pipe)
2000 S_IFCHR  c  020000 character special
3000 S_IFMPC     030000 multiplexed character device (Coherent)
4000 S_IFDIR  d/ 040000 directory
5000 S_IFNAM     050000 XENIX special named file
6000 S_IFBLK  b  060000 block special
7000 S_IFMPB     070000 multiplexed block device (Coherent)
8000 S_IFREG  -  110000 regular
9000 S_IFCMP     110000 VxFS compressed (file?)
a000 S_IFLNK  l@ 120000 symbolic link
b000 S_IFSHAD    130000 Solaris shadow inode for ACL
c000 S_IFSOCK s= 140000 socket (also "S_IFSOC" on VxFS)
d000 S_IFDOOR D  150000 Solaris door
e000 S_IFWHT   % 160000 BSD whiteout (not used for inode)
f000 S_IFMT      170000 mask (not used for inode)
I think you can steal S_IFMPC and S_IFMPB, along with either S_IFCMP
or S_IFSHAD. (since S_IFCMP and S_IFSHAD seem to be internal and do
not exist on the same filesystem, one can be mapped to the other)
I'd be interested in knowing more about S_IFNAM, the "available"
type codes, and anything missing from the table above. People with
S/390 Open Edition, NT, and OpenVMS might have interesting files.
Perhaps these values ought to go into kernel developer documentation.
