Hello all,
We have 64-bit production machines that use the kernel shipped with
a RedHat distribution, linux-2.6.11-1.1369_FC4smp. There have been
no problems until we received recent hardware. With the latest hardware,
which the vendor claims hasn't changed, the machines panic when either
a USB mouse or USB keyboard are plugged in.
Machine:
Supermicro H8DME-2
Two quad-Core AMD Opteron CPUs
64GB DDR2 400 SDRAM
6 SATA2 3.0Gb/s HD Support
2 64-bit 133/100 MHz PCI-X
2 64=bit 100MHz PCI-X
ATI ES1000 Graphics
Chipset nVida MCP55 Pro
NEC uPD720400
USB FUCI, uses ohci_hcd driver.
When mouse or keyboard is inserted, I get a panic with:
"map_single bounce buffer is not DMA'ble."
This comes from: linux-2.6.11-prep/arch/ia64/lib/swiotlb.c,
line 440. I added 64-bit long print hex to the panic statement
so I could display the address it doesn't like.
The address it doesn't like is: 0x000000022a0aa000
Does anybody have a clue what might be the matter and how to fix it?
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
