Thanks for the correction, but that does not change the discussion.

I'm not assuming anything . Some hardware has been killed by this issue.

It seems that it's you making the assumption that all of these devices are  
manufactured the same way.
The constant dirtying of the buffer will still cause excessive use of the  
flash block hosting the FAT. Clearly not all devices use a load spreading  
mechanism and this can lead to premature failure.
