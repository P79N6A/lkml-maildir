Hi Andrew,
    I decided not to let the fact that I have never written any FS code
stand in the way of making suggestions :-) :-)
    Do you think it would be better to make the defragmentation part of
the normal operation of the FS rather than a seperate application.  For
example, if you did a fragmentation check/fix on the last close of a file
you would know that coherency issues were not going to be important.  It
might also give you some way to determine which files were important to
keep close together.
Thanks,
Jim
