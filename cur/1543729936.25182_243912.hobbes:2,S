It doesn't look like it will have any real impact.  The only function
(besides reading /proc/meminfo and
/sys/devices/system/node/node%d/meminfo files) that is affect by this is
get_zone_counts().  get_zone_counts() is already looping over all zones
on all nodes in the system anyway, this new code does exactly that. 
for_each_zone() loops over all the zones by looping through each pgdat
in the system, which is what the new code does, but more explicitly.  We
might do a little better by inlining __get_zone_counts()?
That said, I haven't run any benchmarks or anything... :)
