There are file systems where inode numbers are not enough to represent
a file. In AFS and Coda, for example, a file is identified by four
32-bit numbers (cell, volume, vnode, unique). What you want is some
kind of handle that can be retrieved by a syscall (get_fh) and some
way to open the file again by that handle (open_fh). The handle should
be some largish blob that can be used differently by each file system.
