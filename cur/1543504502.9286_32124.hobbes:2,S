Whoever is responsible for tidying up the Networking screen in
the kernel config (menuconfig) deserves gold and beautiful women
climbing over them all day long.
I was getting quite sick of trying to find PPP or something else
strewn randomly amongst 500 ethernet drivers.
I would have paid someone to clean it up!  ;o)  Well, not really,
but virtually.  ;o)
Anyways, thanks a bundle to whoever was responsible.
