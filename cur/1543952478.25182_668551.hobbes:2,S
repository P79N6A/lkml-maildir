Do you get into ide_error() too? That 176 is WIN_SMART, but you had 
earlier WIN_SMART commands that worked ok, so it's something specific that 
triggers it. data_phase = 1 is TASKFILE_IN.
So try to see if you get to ide_error(), which is where Bartlomiejs latest 
patch was in effect - but add a few printk's there to print out the 'stat' 
variable etc to see if it actually triggers. And maybe a WARN_ON(1) to get 
the trace..
