Hm..., yes, but I would rather express such things as
something that will cause the compiler to complain (i.e.
stop, not just warn).  Possibly something like:
static int
dummy[sizeof(timer_t)+sizeof(int)-sizeof(pid_t)-sizeof(uid_t)];
static int
dummy2[sizeof(pid_t)+sizeof(uid_t)-sizeof(timer_t)-sizeof(int)-];
It is UGLY, but it does cause the right thing (i.e. a
failure) to happen when things are wrong.
Or we could do the same sort of thing on the offset of
_sigval in the several unions, which is what we really care
about.
Thanks for the comments.
