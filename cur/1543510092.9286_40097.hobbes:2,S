In the simple modes, stuff like "send break" and "2 stop bits, 7 bit odd
parity". I don't know if it's plausible to do those over a pty, or if
they're required.  If they are required, AT commands could perhaps be
used instead to get the same effect.
For most uses including ISP connections, there is no problem.
