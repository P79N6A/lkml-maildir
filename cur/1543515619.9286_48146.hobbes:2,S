I never saw any other messages. This isn't private mail that you
posted to linux-kernel?
I find it offensive that you are insulting kernel developers in
the system documentation. That isn't the right way to thank them!
I'd rather not even have a vfork man page. Just toss it out.

You've tested this recently I assume, and such portability did
not detract from the features you could implement... sure.
Oh, portability ought to include VMS and MacOS too.

Well, that would be wrong -- but the man page doesn't say that.

Wild guesses and wishful thinking do not belong in system documentation.
If you don't know what the fork() penalty is, don't write about it.

To some extent, NetBSD is compatible. (to what extent?)
If the other BSD systems follow BSD, we may have a system
call that is portable to all free UNIX-like systems.
