This is similar to the 802.11 way.
802.11 uses MAC_FMT and MAC_ARG.
I think a common style is preferable.
It's fine, but it increases the size of kernel image
by up to ~100K.  Using a common function, a stack
automatic and "%s" in the printk decreases the size
of the kernel. 
Strictly, not all MAC addresses are 6 byte.
Maybe all the Ethernet/TR addresses should use the
IEEE EUI48 designation?  That feels a bit like the
KiB/KB distinction, but it is technically correct.
Would a patch with an DEV6_ADDR->EUI48 substitution
be acceptable?
