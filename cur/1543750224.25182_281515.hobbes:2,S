OK, I figured it out (I think).  I normally go through a Avocent KVM
switch (USB), to share the keyboard and mouse between multiple systems. 
Unfortunately the keyboard died a week or so ago, so I plugged a ps/2
model directly into the main box as a temporary measure... but didn't
think to disconnect the KVM.  After doing so, 2.6.10 correctly detects 
the keyboard on bootup and everything seems to be working correctly.
I haven't pursued it any farther, although I'd be happy to do so if
anyone thinks it would be beneficial.  My guess is that only a single
keyboard is allowed, and 2.6.10 simply saw the USB one first.  Not sure
if that was caused by an explicit change in the code, or merely due to
the order in which the drivers were linked in.  Either way, I'm up and 
running. ;-)
Thanx for your assistance!
