So? If it is a problem for people, fix it. Or remove the damn call. It 
_still_ isn't valid to kill a machine for a non-fatal error.
We're not Windows. We don't take GFP's for random reasons. I'm not
interested in what some people call "hardening", but I _am_ interested in
a system that is rock solid and works even when it doesn't necessarily
expect to.
