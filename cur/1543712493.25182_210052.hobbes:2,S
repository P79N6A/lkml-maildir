Historically they have blocked in a well defined manner - eg when
dropping the DTR signal for a specified minimum time period.
They can also block until the data awaiting transmission has been
sent, which by default has a 30 second timeout, or may be configured
to be "until sent".  Of course, if CTS is deasserted, we will wait
until the timeout.
