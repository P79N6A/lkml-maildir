I think Andi brought it up. I was actually saying that it probably works
most of the time.

The assumption is that the peer is implemented the way you expect and
that the application doesn't toy with TCP_NODELAY.

Not really. You could do one of two things: either ack every second
segment and leave rcv estimation only for window calculations, or use an
algorithm like the one I outlined. Either approach would work, I think,
and not produce strech acks.
