other then the memmap error (in my case device 0:10:0 I get the first
three lines of the driver init and then nothing. the machine
completely locks up (driver version on .54 is 6.2.25 but I've
had this same problem since .50)
here is what I get on 2.4.18, the only difference on the first three lines
between this and 2.5.54 is the driver version number
