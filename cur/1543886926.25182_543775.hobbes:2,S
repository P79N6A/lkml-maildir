Given that people can't be bothered to spell names which fall within
the 7-bit ASCII space correctly, I think all this is very much a
pipedream.
And yes, at the end of the day, it comes down to lazyness and whether
people can be bothered to take the care required to get names correctly
spelt.  Much of my personal experience has been that the majority of
people DO NOT seem to CARE about correctly spelling names.
Or maybe people just like repeatedly insulting me.
While you can arm people with the tools to allow them to do what you
desire (to spell peoples names correctly), at the end of the day I
think you'll find that most people will just not bother.  It's a
nice idea though.
