Hmmm, on my arch (v850) gcc-2.9x produce different, but equally
efficient (no branches) code for both the old `obvious' expression and
the new `convoluted' expression.  gcc-3.3.x produces the _same_ two
instructions for both expressions, except that the two instructions are
in different orders.  :-)
