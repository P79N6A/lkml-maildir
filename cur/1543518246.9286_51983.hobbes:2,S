Careful!  First of all, there are no guarantees that the entire CP437
font is present (after all, it isn't even on many PCs, and the PC font
lacks a lot of *useful* characters); second, lots of people spend most
of their time in X anyhow.
Anyway, you can use the ncurses interface (recommended), or you can
use the escape sequences from /usr/src/linux/Documentation/unicode.txt
to switch between Latin-1, VT100, IBM Code Page 437, and "everything
else".  The last is a huge wart in the console driver IMNSHO; the
obvious solution would be to make it ISO 2022 compliant, but
unfortunately that's impossible to do in a backwards compatible manner
:(
There is also UTF-8 mode, initiated with ESC % G.  Then you can issue
Unicode UTF-8 sequences for whatever character you dang well please.
