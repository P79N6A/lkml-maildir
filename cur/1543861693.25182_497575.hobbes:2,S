i got a hold of a p4 (model 4) and ran the timings there:
                        baseline        patched
                no cache        cache
k8 pre-revF        21             14      16
k8 revF            31             14      17
core2              38             12      17
p4                 49             24      37
not as good as i hoped... i'll have to put the cache back in just for the 
p4... so i'll respin my patch with the cache back in place.
another thought occured to me -- 64-bit processes can't actually use their 
LDT can they?  in that case i could probably use sldt (faster than sidt) 
for 64-bit procs and fallback to sidt for 32-bit emulation (which doesn't 
exist for this vsyscall yet anyhow).
let me know if you have any other feedback.
thanks
