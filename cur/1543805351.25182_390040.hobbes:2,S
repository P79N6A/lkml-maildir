Somewhat confusing...I downloaded kernel-2.6.15-1.1871_FC5.src.rpm and 
extracted linux-2.6-modsign-mpilib.patch from the srpm. After diffing 
the mpi dirs created by the previously mentioned patch and that from the 
Fedora kernel I get:
(david@austin:~/src/kernel/div)$ diff -Nurbw linux-2.6.9-rc4-mm1/crypto/mpi/ linux-902/crypto/mpi/
diff -Nurbw linux-2.6.9-rc4-mm1/crypto/mpi/mpi-div.c linux-902/crypto/mpi/mpi-div.c

        return -ENOMEM;
        divisor = temp_divisor;
     }
Was that all the difference there was or am I missing something?
