Yes! Weve been having the same problem with a fileserver running on a
k6-2 with an epox mobo and a netgear card that the redhat install
program recognizes as a lite on. I was having problems with my desktop
machine too but the problem seems much improved with the 2.3.49 kernel,
though It still stops occaisionally.
 Weve really been racking our brains over this if it is a dma problem
or  a kernel problem let me know if you find a solution.
