BTW.  Were I to wager a guess, I would guess it's related to the paging
problems in 2.4 when a process gets cloned, since everytime I have seen
it, it happens when a child process gets forked then accesses the cloned
data from the parent.  In the previous core dumps, it always puked right
after a call to fork() when the child process attempted to WRITE (not
read) data in the program.
