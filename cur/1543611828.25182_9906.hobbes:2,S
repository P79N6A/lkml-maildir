You're forgetting that Linus makes a kernel, not an OS.
This isn't the Linux OS Mailing List, it's the Linux Kernel Mailing List.
How can Linus be expected to make a formal design for a kernel
when he has no control over how the kernel is used?
(This being the strength of Linux : it can be used almost everywhere)
If you want an _OS_ try one of the BSD's : they have a declared purpose,
after all :)
