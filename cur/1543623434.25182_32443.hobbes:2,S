Hi,

The patch that was merged in 2.4.18-pre* has been created against
2.4.17-pre7 and it did work. The problem is that not all of the
changes I sent Marcelo have been accepted. One of the patches was
the asm-offsets fix that removes all of the hardcoded offsets from
entry.S. Another patch was accepted that changed the thread
structure and this created the inconsistency.
>Patch attached.
Well your patch halfway fixes one of the problems. Halfway because
not the fp_regs structure has changed its size but the pt_regs
pointer has been removed from the thread structure.
Incidentally I sent an s390 update to Marcelo yesterday and the
minimal fixes including an rwsem.h implementation and the partition
detection fixes are about 2000 lines. Want a copy ?
