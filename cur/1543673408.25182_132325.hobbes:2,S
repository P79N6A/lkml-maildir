If you really want it to work, try `insmod -f modulename.o`. See of it
works. RedHat supplies kernels with "intermediate" version numbers
like linux-2.4.18-24. A perfectly-good module from linux-2.4.18
may fail to load without the '-f' option, even though it is probably
compatible. Try it, it may work fine. You can modify /etc/rc.d/rc.local
to insert the module during startup so you don't have to muck with
/etc/modules.conf (and having other startup-code change it when it
"finds" new hardware.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
