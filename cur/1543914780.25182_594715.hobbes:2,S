Are you open to doing something other than pthreads? Using fork() to
get real processes, and then sending a SIGSTOP (and SIGCONT) to the
one running main() should work.
Or emulating the interrupt arrival with a signal, and having
interrupt_handler() be registered as the signal handler. Of course,
you then have to deal with the constraints that come with signal
handlers, so that can be a bit of a pain depending on what you're
trying to do.
