Did the person giving that advice say that was OK, even with code that
originally had a more permissive license, such as the LGPL code from glibc?

Particularly since there isn't any *real* legal distinction between the EXPORT
and EXPORT_GPL - anybody who can cite actual case law, rather than just "we
kernel nerds think and our lawyers mumble" is invited to do so. In the case of
'mcount', we're specifically talking about a symbol that's only referenced
*because the kernel's include files and config tell it to*.  It's not even a
reference the code includes - it's a reference included *BY THE COMPILER*.
I'd love to see how you'd argue this in court - "Your honor, this static piece
of source code is infringing on our copyright as a derivative work, even though
it in no way shape or form references the symbol, depending on a compiler flag,
which is out of the code author's control".
Based on that, I'd have to say that the actual abuse of the GPL, if any,
lies with the maintainers of GCC, since gcc is what created the reference to
the problematic symbol, not the authors of the actual source code.
