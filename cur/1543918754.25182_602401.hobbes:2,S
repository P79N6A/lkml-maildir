The ISDN driver documentation always listed the numbers in the kernel documentation
even though people in theory could have gotten it from the specification too.
I always found that quite convenient. Putting at least a summary in Documentation
would probably user-friendly. It tends to be hard to find stuff in specifications,
especially if you're not very familiar with the standard.
