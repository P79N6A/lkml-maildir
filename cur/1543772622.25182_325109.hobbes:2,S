Its running apparently ok Ingo, but it fussed during the boot because 
CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE was still on, so my ./makeit script is running 
again after turning that off.  I'd turned its parent in the xconfig 
display off mistakenly figureing that got the child.  kconfig 
miss-cue?
Rebooted to it, no warnings.  Glitch reports as they are found. :-)
