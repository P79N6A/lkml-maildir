Alpha UP2000 has got an on-board Adaptec controller.
Unfortunately, the custom-kernel compiled from 2.2.15pre14 panicked
without any message during scsi installation.  Independent of t
agged-command-queueing.  It has on-board Adaptec controller 
that can do Ultra-2 SCSI.  I wish I new the chipset number  but I don't
know it yet.  No information in API's web page.  I simply assumed that it
is something like 2940U2W or something and the driver must be aic7xxx.o.
   Similar behaviour was observed with the previous version of aic7xxx.c
which was with 2.2.15pre13 with t.c.q enabled.  I tested kernel 
2.2.13 with t.c.q. enabled.  It failed also.  The 2.2.13-0.9smp compiled 
by RedHat with t.c.q disabled works.
I think I should stick in sym53c875 in UP2000.
