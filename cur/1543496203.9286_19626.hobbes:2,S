Yeah, if you can't be bothered to read the man page and set your own
options, you deserve what you get.  The slackware install (does anyone
still use slackware?) used to give you the option of setting the

this was too complicated for Joe Redhat user....
I think that intelligent setting of the default size is a very good idea.
