    After compiling a custom kernel for a new slackware 7.0 based firewall I
noticed that my new kernel started displaying the "Unable to load
interpreter" right after starting init.  init itself freezes for a good
number of seconds before that message pops up and booting continues.  I
remember this message being mentioned before on this list.  What would cause
it?
