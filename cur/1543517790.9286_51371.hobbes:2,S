Would you call this a solution? This is a very ugly workaround. The fact
this works is only a side effect of the limitations of the hardlink.
So another solution is to take your data in a separated filesystem mounted
in /home/alexander so nobody will be able to do hardlinks across a
filesystem.
I don't buy this point, sorry. With a 500giga filesystem it make no sense
to make a partition for /tmp and I _want_ to be able to create hardlinks
all over the place exactly because they are useful. So the less filesystem
there are, the better will be for the hardlink case.

I don't like it either, but you should see it as a very seldom thing. I
just assume we need a level of security that will allow an admin to
trivially catch very silly guys and that avoids to mess up the fs.

/tmp is owned by root but the quota is increased in the owner of the inode
that is trashing metadata away in /tmp.
NOTE: I can as well ignore this thread as I don't need this feature for
myself and if nobody needs this kind of basic security either, than this
is wasted time.
