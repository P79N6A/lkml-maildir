yea!!! 
That's it!!!!
since the USB mouse basically worked I never thought that there is some
usb stuf missing ...
and of course the controler module got renamed from 2.4.xx :))
everything works now and my scroll wheel issue got also solved by
loading the host controller 
Can now use 2.5 as the default system. I need it because the wlan driver
seems much more stable than on my 2.4 system
thanks for the hints
