Hi Geert,
the driver looks pretty good, just a few details I noticed:

Any reason not to use msleep(1) instead of the schedule_timeout?

Why do you have separate constants for PS3_DEV_TYPE_* and
PS3_MATCH_ID_*? If you don't do any conversion, this driver
will immediately work for additional types as well, if more
get added later.

Should be removed, or not in comments, either way is fine, as pr_debug
normally does not get compiled in anyway.

Is this timeout only for the disk spinup, or also for detecting media
added at run time, like inserting a DVD? One minute timeout for
detecting a DVD would sound very long to me.
