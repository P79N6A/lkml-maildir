I am just out to share a possible angle. -all though not really a programmer.
Can one module replace another -running- twin-module without having to hand-
shake with the kernel? -and without freezing ? (transparently)
If obvious no - no need to read further.
Otherwhise, there might be a possibility to create a shut-down module out of 
the existing module it self?
In this case it could probably be a smooth solution to ask the module creator.
(if known, and available) if he/she would be able to make this modification 
on the fly, as he/she probably knows the most about how the signals operate. 
That is to strip down the existing loadable module into sort of a dummy. 
Of course this won't work if hazardous removal issues are shared among all or 
most of the existing kernel modules.
An apology for taking up time and bandwith. But rmmod is such a neat command 
to have a round.
