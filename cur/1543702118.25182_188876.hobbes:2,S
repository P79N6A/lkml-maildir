Excellent!  I haven't read through the proposal yet but I have it open
in another window.  :-)
The detailed proposal you've written implies that Sun as a whole has
given serious thought to the problem, which IMHO is how to make linux
autofs work like Solaris autofs.  Is Sun willing to devote man-hours to
help implement the new autofs?  I think Ian has done a tremendous job
with autofs4 but the more minds we throw at the problem the better.
