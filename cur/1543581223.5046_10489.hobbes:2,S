It is indeed from clgen, but even there it's only needed on the PReP boxes
with a cirrus logic card.  The MacPicasso cards (also clgen) need some other
magic (see linux-fbdev).

Well, it's definatly not doing anything now.  It probably shouldn't be there
anyways, as in clgen it seems to be for PReP black magic.
