Subject: [PATCH] PCI: don't override drv->shutdown unconditionally
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/6/17/143

There are many drivers that have been setting the generic driver
model level shutdown callback, and pci thus must not override it.
Without this patch we can have really bad data loss on various
raid controllers.
