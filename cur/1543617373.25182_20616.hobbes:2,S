Absolutely not.
To invoke the autoconfigurator, you do one of two things:
`make autoconfigure' 
    This runs the autoconfigurator in standalone mode.  This gives you
an entire configuration, ready to build with.
`make autoprobe {config,menuconfig,xconfig}' 
    This runs the autoconfigurator in probe mode, which gives you
a report on facilities found (without making assumptions about facilities
not found).  This report gets fed to your interactive configurator, which
then proceeds not to bother you with questions for which the autoprobe 
report already gave it answers.
The ordinary make {config,menuconfig,xconfig} behaves as it always did.
