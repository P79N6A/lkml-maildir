I'm having trouble finding this on Google now, but I've heard rumors
over the years of old Fireball drives corrupting data if they receive
write commands too soon after spinning up (i.e., the drive doesn't
bother waiting to spin up fully first). Maybe I'm not remembering the
details correctly, but it was something about the drive trying to act on
commands before it was fully spun up and malfunctioning as a result.
