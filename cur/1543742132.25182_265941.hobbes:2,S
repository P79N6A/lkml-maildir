Note, these concerns are the same before the last pci_save_state()
changes, right?  I didn't break anything new did I?  :)

Hm, probably.  I'm away from my PCI book, so I don't really know about
that one.  For some reason we've been ok so far...

yeah, good point.  I guess most of these cards don't have BIST stuff in
them.  Or just writing back the read value is sane.  I'll dig through
the PCI book next week.

We need to have a "bridge" driver for something like that.  I think lots
of things would benifit if we had that.  But if we had that, we need a
way to overload (or weight) different drivers that might bind to the
same device.  This is something that we've talked about for a while now,
and it's on my list of things to do in the near future.  I think once we
get that, a "generic" bridge driver will be ok to have.  Any hardware
specific quirks needed can also just be their own driver (I think Red
Hat ran into odd issues when they tried to add a pci bridge driver to
one of their older kernel trees.)
Oh, and yeah, we should probably save and restore pci express config
space too.  I need to go look to see if pci x 2.0 also has a expanded
config or not...
thanks,
