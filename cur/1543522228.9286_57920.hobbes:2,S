It's not that hard. You should recompile only applications with IPC usage.

If they are using ancient programs they can recompile kernel for sure :-)

Hmm. Now I can understood Andries :-(( It was never worked before and will
not work here. Peoples are LAZY. Program authors are lazy as well. So they
WILL NOT fix programs if they are works "by default". THE ONLY way to go is
to make default max_pid > 32767 (8323071 or 4161535 perhaps to help make
clusters). Then old programs will be broken and will be recompiled. If default
will not break them they'll not be recompiled and fixed forever.

No. It will not happen. If default will not be >32767 then even 10 years
later we'll have "developers" who will be asking "How so ? PIDs > 32767 are
suddenly allowed ? We did not hear anything about this :-(". Latest version
of Adobe Acrobat are still libc5-based, for example :-/
