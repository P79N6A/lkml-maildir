Ok. this is beginning to confuse me.
glibc install:
   Note that `/usr/include/net' and `/usr/include/scsi' should *not* be
   symlinks into the kernel sources.  GNU libc provides its own versions
   of these files.
kernel docs:
Several distributions have taken their own copies of these files and placed
them in /usr/include/scsi which is where "#include <scsi/sg.h>" would go
looking. The directory /usr/include/scsi _should_ be a symbolic link to
/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/ . It was is Redhat 5.1 and 5.2 but it is
not is Redhat 6.0 . Some other distributions have the same problem. To
solve this (as root) do the following:
# cd /usr/include
# mv scsi scsi_orig
# ln -s ../src/linux/include/scsi scsi
Now, the question that I have is... What in the name of god am I to do?
*sob*
I hope someone can understand my confusion...
