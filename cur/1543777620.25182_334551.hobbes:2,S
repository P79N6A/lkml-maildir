Actually, reiserfs doesn't use the mbcache, so this can go:

Removing the cache parameter from mb_cache_shrink would break when more than 
one mb_cache is used per filesystem, correct. Leaving the parameter in and 
adding your patch is more "future proof", so I'm fine with it. Are you 
actually using more than one mb_cache, or is this theoretical?
As you say in your follow-up mail, without your patch the cache would become 
less effective, it won't crash anything, though.
