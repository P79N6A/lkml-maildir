So, officially, does this mean:
1. anybody needing greater resolution in /proc can go screw themselves
2. anybody wanting a fast HZ without hacking /proc can do likewise
3. anybody needing more than 32 groups can do likewise
4. app and libc developers should not try to help these people
It is your kernel of course, but the above is really cruel.
You increased the max number of processes, bytes in a file, and
valid user IDs. Were those not all interfaces of equal standing?

The interface is defined as using sysconf() so that you _don't_ need
to have magic constants that remain unchangable for all eternity.
With that, "NGROUPS is 32" is no longer an interface that must be
maintained -- you get the freedom to change it.
Having some boot script hack up numbers via testing the limits
is truly gross, especially since testing some of the limits is
pretty much a self-inflicted DoS attack.

That won't handle dynamic stuff, like the number of online processors.
Make it /dev/sysconf and the problems go away.
