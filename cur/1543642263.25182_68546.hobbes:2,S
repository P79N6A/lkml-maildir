   In sys_ia32.c file, in the do_sys32_msgrcv() function call,  the value of
   ipck.msgp is interpreted as a 64 bit address, whereas it is a 32 bit
   address.
   Hence, do_sys32_msgrcv() finally returns EFAULT(bad address) error.
   The patch below takes care of this by type casting ipck.msgp to type u32.
   The patch is created for 2.5.32 version of the kernel.
It's still broken.
Fix this instead by declaring ipc_kludge with the proper
32-bit types.  This is why the identical code works on
sparc64 for sparc32 emulation. :-)
