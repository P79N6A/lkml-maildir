Many times when the kernel forks another process, it crashes. It
looks like you have one (or more) of the following:
(1)	Bad RAM.
(2)	Over Clocked.
(3)	CPU too hot (wrong heatsink).
(4)	Bad board (why somebody got rid of it was on ebay).
Hopefully, it isn't (4). I got a Tyan board off from ebay once.
It was the last time I did that. $135 down the drain. It would
boot DOS/Windows/Linux, then stop.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
