None of the interrupts are doing anything wrong.  oprofile shows nothing
alarming.
Disabling cpufreq in config doesn't fix it.
Userspace can count to a billion in 3.9 seconds when this problem is
present, which is the same time as it takes on a non-slow kernel.
`sleep 5' takes 5 seconds.
Yet initscripts take a long time (especially applying the ipfilter firewall
rues for some reason), and `startx' takes a long time, etc.  This kernel
takes 112 seconds to boot to a login prompt - other kernels take 56 seconds
(interesting ratio..)
Weird.
