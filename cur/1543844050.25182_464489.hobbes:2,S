I don't think that need be the case if one of the CPUs that has written
the variable forwards the store to a subsequent load before it reaches
the cache coherency (I could be wrong here). So if that is the case, then
your above example would be correct.
But if I'm wrong there, I think Paul's statement holds even if all
stores to a single cacheline are always instantly coherent (and thus do
have some global ordering). Consider a variation on your example where
one CPU loads 1,2 and another loads 1,3. What's the order?
