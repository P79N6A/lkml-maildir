Apologies for continuing in a separate post, I seem to have had and did 
a send before I was ready.
The reason I use cdrecord is just what you say, convenience. I have 
written tons of scripts over the years to use it, and perl programs to 
prepare it's input and commands, and I have no reason to change because 
it whines at me when I say /dev/hde instead of 2,0,1 or whatever. It's 
in a config file, I only need to see it once, so I don't care.
Joerg gave us a working program when cdwrite died, he keeps it up to 
date, and I'm happy with it still. I wish he would learn to "play well 
with others," but he doesn't CARE if users like the interface, and he 
possibly keeps the ProDVD closed source just to piss people off. He's 
smart enough to know that contributions work better than closed source, 
he just doesn't care to change his policy. His choice.
