Err, no, that's wrong.  sti() unconditionally enables interrupts - if
an sti() was placed here, it's pointless using save_flags() (which
saves the old interrupt enable state) and restore_flags() (which
restores the interrupt enable state).
Also remember that interruptible_sleep_* is only safe on UP machines
provided it's called with interrupts disabled.
