One reason is for code cleanliness. Linux's internal data structures for irq
routing and MPS stuff on i386 were not designed to handle the possibility of
multiple ways of getting this info. ACPI init gets in there and does its
thing, but it could be better architected. Making the legacy config options
removable is one way to ensure the kernel has things properly modularized
wrt this, and yes, I think someday (maybe not soon) someone *will* want to
leave out MPS support.

All I can say is using just *part* of ACPI will cause some machine,
somewhere, to not work. I want to avoid scenarios where that happens. If
there are issues with that, can we discuss them asap, perhaps now?
