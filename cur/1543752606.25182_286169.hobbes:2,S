Scripts can only do what the interpreter does. And it's often a lot harder
to get the interpreter to do certain things. For example, you simply
_cannot_ get any thread race conditions with most scripts out there, nor 
can you generally use magic mmap patterns.
Am I claiming that disallowing self-written ELF binaries gets rid of all 
security holes? Obviously not. I'm claiming that there are things that 
people can do that make it harder, and that _real_ security is not about 
trusting one subsystem, but in making it hard enough in many independent 
ways that it's just too effort-intensive to attack.
It's the same thing with passwords. Clearly any password protected system
can be broken into: you just have to guess the password. It then becomes a
matter of how hard it is to "guess" - at some point you say a password is
secure not because it is a password, but because it's too _expensive_ to
guess/break.
So all security issues are about balancing cost vs gain. I'm convinced
that the gain from openness is higher than the cost. Others will disagree.
