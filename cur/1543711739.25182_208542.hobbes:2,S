I guess a little background would help to explain the "desparation".
I have been helping to debug a problem that occurred at another
company. We were provided with stack-traces (generated with sysrq-t).
We also had the vmlinuz file, and sources. We were not provided with a
vmlinux file.  We made an attempt to build the same kernel, but there
was enough uncertainty about the build environment, configuration
files, etc. that we wanted to compare with the actual kernel that
was being used.

In my case, the vmlinux file, .o's, etc. were not available.

The decompressed file did not contain an elf header, and could not be
opened with objdump.

I think I have answered your questions above. The sequence that I
described in my post is certainly a round-about solution. But it
worked quite well...
