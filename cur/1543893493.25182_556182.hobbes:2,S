It is executable now (Linus did a chmod).
However I think it was wrong to do this.  Because lots of people will lose
that X bit (say, people who download and use patch-2.6.22.gz).  But _some_
people will have their X bit set, so they will go write scripts which
assume X permissions, only to find that those scripts break on other
people's systems.
So to force the lowest-common-denominator, we should have left X unset.  Oh
well.
