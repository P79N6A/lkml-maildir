Only if the size of a random module can be between 0 and a full page....
Module sizes are skewed data... there is a minimum size for a module
(somewhere around 1k, I believe - didn't measure it), and if the module
is going to DO anything then it will be between 1-2K. This skews the data
sample such that you are only loosing 1/2 of (1 page - minimum) or 1/2 of
3K = 1.5K. Hence the 1/3 measured loss will be closer to the correct
theoretical loss than 1/2.
