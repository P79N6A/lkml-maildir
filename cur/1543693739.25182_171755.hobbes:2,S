Have you ever noticed that O_DIRECT is a piece of crap?
The interface is fundamentally flawed, it has nasty security issues, it 
lacks any kind of sane synchronization, and it exposes stuff that 
shouldn't be exposed to user space.
I hope disk-based databases die off quickly. Yeah, I see where you are
working, but where I'm coming from, I see all the _crap_ that Oracle tries
to push down to the kernel, and most of the time I go "huh - that's a
f**king bad design".
