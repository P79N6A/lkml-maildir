Well, I hope that the fragmentation of Unix in the 80'ies with the
resulting rise of an unified OS to be marked leader ("DOS", then
"Windows") should've learned that lesson with the vendors.
Linux ATM is heading exactly in the same direction as Unix went when
Sun/HP/IBM/DEC decided not to keep an unified Unix base. It isn't
heading that fast, mainly because the vendors must keep open source
trees and they work from a central baseline ("Linus kernels") but we
already have various distributions which sell "Linux" with a hugely
different kernel. Think e.g.  VM or devfs. Or supported file systems.
