Sorry, but the patch does not work for me.  The resulting kernel
reboots, but it _disables_ (or fails to enable?) the PS/2 keyboard.
I don't know if it is of any interest, but I'm using grub to load
linux (and in the grub boot shell the keyboard works).

No.  I'm using a MSI Mainboard with AMD (Viper) chipset.
