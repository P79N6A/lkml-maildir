I don't think it does. There are two pieces to the problem
	a)	Not dying horribly
	b)	Handling it elegantly
b) is driver specific (NAPI etc) and I think well understood to the point
its being used already for performance reasons
a) is as simple as 
	if(stuck_in_irq(foo) && irq_shared(foo))
	{
		disable_real_irq(foo);
		timer_fake_irq_foo();
	}
We know spoofing a shared irq is safe.
