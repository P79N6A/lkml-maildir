Which in theory you can get by asking the drive for the real sector size
from the ATA7 info. (We ought to dig this out more as its relevant for
partition layout too).

That seems to be arguing for a bounded "live" time including retry run
time for a command. That's also more intuitive for real time work and for
end user setup. "Either work or fail within n seconds"
