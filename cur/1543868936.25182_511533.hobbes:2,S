That's basically just an optimization.  If it wasn't there, then data
from a another (shared) mapping could be written back, which is not
wrong, but not required either.

The problems will start, when you have a file that is both mapped and
modified with write().  Then the dirying from the write() will set the
flag, and that will have undesirable consequences.
