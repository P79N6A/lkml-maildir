Not exactly.
Whenever a process makes a system call, it goes into kernel mode, so both
CPUs can be in kernel mode. But with 2.0 only one at a time, because
there was the global kernel lock. 
2.2 is much more fine-grained. And IRQs are distributed to the CPUs by
supporting the IO-APIC chip.
Note that IRQ13/16 is the IPI (Inter-Processor-Interrupt). One CPU can
send it to the other to signal anything (TLB flush, reschedule). So this
answers your question, does it?
The CPU receiving the timer IRQ will send an IRQ16 to the other to signal
them to reschedule.

SMP support consists of two parts:
(a) The chipset (routing IRQs and more, ask Ingo Molnar)
(b) The CPU  (TLB consistency, ...)
As both K7 and 21264 will probably use the same chipset, it will help (a).
