I think in the past Larry stated that people should not use the
www.bkbits.net site for retrieving patches (understandable, it
increases the bandwidth usage). But he could use the bk-commits list,
only that I'm not sure all the patches can be cleanly applied in the
order they are posted.
BKCVS has a problem with the timestamps and cvsps cannot be used
properly - in the same changeset, some files can have a timestamp
different by exactly one hour, cvsps generating two patches (with
other patches generated between). For example, the logical change
1.24006 has the modification time for arch/i386/kernel/process.c
22:45:49 but for the rest of the files it is 21:45:49.
Could this get fixed? (I hope it is not intentional :-) )
