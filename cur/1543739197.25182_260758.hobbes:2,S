Because that's what get_cpu_var() does, and an arch might not need to
get the processor id to do it.  As more things get per-cpu-ified, and
smp_processor_id() for its own sake becomes more unusual, I expect archs
to go to smp_processor_id() as a per-cpu variable, and a register
holding the per-cpu offset.  (This needs a real dynamic per-cpu
allocator, as well, which I've been meaning to polish off).

That's weird, but implies bogosity in the caller.  Covering it up like
this is not necessarily a win.
