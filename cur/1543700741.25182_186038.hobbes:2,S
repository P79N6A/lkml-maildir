Raidzone does not ship a "stock" kernel but a kernel with a lot of changes
including changes to make their binary only modules possible (the legality
of this is left as an excercise to the reader).
You really shouldn't be running a 2.4.16 kernel (not without the latest
security patches for such a kernel from a distro) given the amount of security issues
fixed since... and since I don't think any distro ever shipped 2.4.16 (some
shipped 2.4.17, a bunch shipped 2.4.18 but even RH doesn't do patches for
that 2.4.18 tree anymore since they have been obsoleted by 2.4.20 and newer
kernels).
