Hi, your plan looks good to me.
some comments.

For freeing up SPARSEMEM sections of memory ? 
It looks that you assumes MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES equals to PAGES_PER_SECTION.
plz don't assume that when you talk about generic arch code.

I think this can be one of the most diffcult things ;)

I had a patch for ACPI-memory-hot-unplug, which ties memory sections to memory
chunk on ACPI.

I (numa-node-hotplug) needs 7 and 8 basically. And Other people may not.
IMHO:
For DIMM unplug, I suspect that we'll finally divide memory to core-memory and
hot-pluggable by pgdat even on SMP. If we use pgdat for that purpose, almost all
necessary infrastructure(statistics ,etc..) is ready. 
But if we find better way, it's good.
