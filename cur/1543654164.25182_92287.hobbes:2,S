    Me too!
    In 2.5.47 mainline and 2.5.49-ac1 the ALSA drivers (either sb16 or
sbawe) load but don't detect devices if PNP support is built in.  The
same card (an awe64) works fine under 2.4.19.
    Without PNP sb16 works (with only sb16 features) but sbawe will
not load, complaining that it can't find the awe bits.
