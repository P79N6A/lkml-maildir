Depends. If you need a few bytes (and upto 1Kb I'd call a few bytes if
you're careful), then stack usage is fine. If you need more, well, kmalloc
is some 100 cycles...

notice the *small*
The alternative is to double the amount of PER PROCESS overhead in terms of
unswappable memory... Even 1 disk IO will hurt more than your kmalloc of 4Kb
of "small buffers and structures" will in a year.
