Keeping the legal stuff out of sight for a second, this'll solve the
"problem" for the embedded developer, but surely not for the Linux
community. Would you ever expect that eg. the thin GPL layer used by
ATI/NVidia would be merged iff the rest would run in userland?
It's just a workaround for the
linking-the-object-file-into-the-kernel-image problem, but after all,
it doesn't lead to a working driver being freely available.
