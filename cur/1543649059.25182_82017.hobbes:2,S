Negative feedback loops good.  Magic numbers bad.  ;)
Count me in for trying to get a self-tuning system working.
Note that I'll happily make one big exception for magic
numbers ... those magic numbers that directly influence how
the user percieves the machine's behaviour, since the speed
at which users observe things (and the timespan the machine
needs to react in) are fairly well known.

The scheduler might not care, but you can be pretty sure that
the user does care, and will complain loudly if program startup
stops the multimedia playback.
Fairness problems beyond a power-of-2-magnitude and multimedia
hickups are the two main things you can expect users to complain
about.
