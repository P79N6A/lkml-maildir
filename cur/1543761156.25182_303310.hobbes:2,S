Tom,
Sorry - I got this wrong.
He was referring to an unpublished draft "Error Reporting ECN".
You'll have to talk to Intel's PCI-SIG representative to get a copy.
[ Ugh. And everyone else is SOL - sorry ]
I'm annoyed he wanted me to raise this in a public forum without
having a public document to point at. And I'm annoyed at myself
for being lazy and not verifying that before hand...
sorry,
grant
