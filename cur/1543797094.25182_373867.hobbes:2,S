You need to know what it is that you intend to do if the code
encounters a locked section.
For example, let's pretend that every operation is atomic so
that only the logic is investigated...
 	if(!critical_section_flag) {
             critical_section_flag = TRUE;
             do_something_in_critical_section();
         }
         else
             WTF?;
A spin-lock will prevent the current CPU from even getting to
or modifying data in the critical section because alternate paths
via interrupts are blocked. The only other way for data to be
modified is from another CPU. That CPU will spin until the current
CPU releases the lock.
Atomic operations on flags (semaphores) provide the opportunity
for another CPU to do something useful until the critical section
is released, the WTF above. However, if the other CPU can't
schedule you are caught between a rock and a hard-place because
you would need to spin anyway.
Basically, if you can schedule, it's much better to protect
a section with semaphores and do the down(&semi) / up(&semi) thing.
If you can't schedule, it's much cleaner to use a spin-lock
which, in fact, will prevent interference with the critical
section in most cases because, unless another CPU is idle,
it is unlikely to encounter the same thread of code.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
