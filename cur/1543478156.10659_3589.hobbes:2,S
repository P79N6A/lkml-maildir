hi all,
i just moved my kernel from pre6 to pre7. now, i get a "memory
exhausted... system halted" error when vmlinuz is getting
loaded. this, of course, didn't happen with pre6. any thoughts on what
might have changed to cause this?
some stats:
     lowly 486dx4/100 w/ a lowly 20MB of memory (CONFIG_M486 selected)
     compiled bzImage using egcs 1.1.1
     everything else redhat 5.1 based.
devices and whatnot:
     both eide and buslogic fast scsi
     smc ultra 10BaseT ethernet card
of course, pre7 works fine on a couple new SMP pentiumII 450's that we
have as well as my lowly udb/alpha. in addition, nothing really pops
out to me in the pre7 patch, so i'm currently at a loss to why this is
happening.
