We should export the "user jiffies". Eventually this _may_ become a
real per-arch constant, but for now it is not. For now it is just HZ,
and you can't stop people from adjusting it. User-space already has
to hack around the lack of __SC_CLK_TCK, and I assure you that it is
very gross... the procps code could make you vomit.
The only promise needed is that __SC_CLK_TCK match the units used
in /proc and tick-based system call(s). Even if HZ were to die, we'd
still need some sort of unit to represent stuff in /proc. That unit
is the one that userspace needs.
Suggestion for glibc NGROUPS_MAX problem: in the typical way of
hacking around lack of kernel support, have glibc run a setuid-root
executable that reads kernel memory. Use the System.map file to
seek out a suitable spot. You get bonus points for using statistical
methods or arch-specific disassembly of the executable code.
