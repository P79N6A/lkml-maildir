Hi!
I've been hacking my way around the 2.2.13 TCP stack and I'm a bit
confused about how the concurrency issues with the shared data (tcp_opt)
in the socket struct are dealt with. For example, what ensures that the
congestion window decisions are atomic?
Anyone got any pointers for documentation or a quick overview?
Whats the recommended way to get the ip_tos byte set per packet in the IP
layer from the TCP layer? At present I'm fiddling with sk->ip_tos which
feels nasty. What can I expect from the routing code (which has tos
options) when I do this? (These questions are relevent for an ECN TCP
implementation, RFC 2481).
Thanks,
Tom
