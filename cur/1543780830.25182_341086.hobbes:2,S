every 3 or 4 days or so when I really use the card. (please notice all 16 entries are used and the length is 0)

I am in contact with the maintainer and currently am trying to see what
effect a smaller mtu and/or older driver versions might have.
>Because of the impact of this nasty bug (many users have these chips in
their hardware) I would like to ask if others could have a look into this
problem as well. Please email me your experiences (2.6.x kernel? Same bug or
no problem? Fixes? Etc).
What is "ccf80030 vs ccf80030"? Those numbers are the same...
Maybe you need to add more debugging prints in that part of code.
But anyway:
Since it happens less than once a day, why not just add a code
to reset the NIC completely in this case, like it is
typically done in tx_timeout handlers of many NICs, and forget about it?
