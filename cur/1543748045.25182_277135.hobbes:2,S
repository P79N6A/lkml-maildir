Added a "Seagate ST3200822A Barracuda 7200.7 Plus 200GB" disk to my
main PC which uses a with "Promise PDC20265 (FastTrak100
Lite/Ultra100) (rev 02)" controller.
I get these when placing the disk under any load (DMA enabled)
hde: dma_intr: status=0xff { Busy }
ide: failed opcode was: unknown
hde: DMA disabled
PDC202XX: Primary channel reset.
PDC202XX: Secondary channel reset.
(a number of times)
ide2: reset timed-out, status=0xff
end_request: I/O error, dev hde, sector 11776
Buffer I/O error on device hde, logical block 1472
(many times)
Any clues, greatfully received.
I've tried under 2.6.8 through 2.6.9-ac9 & 2.6.10-rc2 with the same effect.
Thanks,
Al.
