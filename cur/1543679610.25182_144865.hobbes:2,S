Probably.  It would reduce the number of mappings by 25% (3 instead of 4).
My assumption is two adjecent IOMMU entries have contigious bus addresses.
I was trying to figure out if x86-64 should be setting
BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY to 0 or 4k.
It sounds like x86-64 could support "#define BIO_VMERGE_BOUNDARY 4096"
if the IOMMU code will return one DMA address for two SG list entries
in the above example.
