Not so funny for those who've tried to sort out the issue over
the past years and just got ignored..

It's a slab page, and slab pages aren't refcounted (which is a good thing
as you don't own the whole page)

slab code.

For example all log I/O is done from kmalloce pages.
Anyway, to rehash what I've been trying to get clarified for ages:
 (1) should we allow to pass slab pages into bios
and
 (2) if yes what's the way lower layers are supposed to handle them
     for any possible refcounting operations like networking or rdma.
There's also a pontial caller in ext3 that can send down kmalloc'ed
buffers: journal_write_metadata_buffer() in need_copy_out && !done_copy_out
case.  But apparently that's an almost dead code path as I've never
seen anyone tripping this one, it's always XFS that people report.
