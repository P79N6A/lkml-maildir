Incorrect in what respect? Riley Williams and Peter Moulder are the
maintainers (as I mentioned Peter just lately fixed a long standing bug so
e2compr is not completely unmaintained), but that doesn't mean anyone is
porting it to 2.4. I personally haven't seen any messages or alpha patches
that would indicate the work is in progress. Of course that doesn't mean
anything either.
I do recall there was some discussion about this at l-k - by Stephen
Tweetie and Riley Williams, if I recall correctly - but I think it didn't
catch wind. It won't be a trivial task due to the buffer cache changes in
2.4 etc. I know I'm not up to it ;) (I stared at the e2compr code long
enough (trying to fix the mentioned race) to know I will not understand
the internals without a big help from someone.
