au contraire again. microkernels don't show the effect of decoupling
them, they show the effect of distinct implementations of each
subsystem. again, your example:

relies on the assumption that the file is a data storage device. the
framebuffer is not a data storage device, and neither is the network
interface, and there is *no* reason for there to be coupling between
i/o to them and the disk writes. Here's a different example:
 Task 1                         Task 2                       Task 3
 generates audio samples and	copies data to disk on FS    does FFT and
 copies the data to a DAC                                    displays result
there is no reason for the output of task 1, task 2 or task 3 to be
coupled (by locks and other kernel synchronization mechanisms) other
than the fact that will all copy data from the same page(s).  i'm
starting to sound like a broken record here.
