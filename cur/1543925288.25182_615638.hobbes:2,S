Subject: [2.6 patch] remove additional pci_scan_child_bus() prototype
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There's already a prototype for pci_scan_child_bus() at the correct 
place in pci.h, so there's no reason for an additional one.
