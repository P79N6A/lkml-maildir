Yes IP is best-effort. But this argument cant explain why IP on linux works
better if we disable SMP on linux...
I'm sorry Andy but "IP is best effort" sounds very lazy in this case.
SMP should give more power to the machine, not drop some frames because
'another CPU' is busy and has a lock we *need*.
