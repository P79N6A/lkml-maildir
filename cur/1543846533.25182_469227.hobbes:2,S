Killed and logging an OOM message ? That indicates a bug (well for ratio
<= about 50% anyway). Killed because there is no memory and a memory
allocation fails is expected.

If you run out of memory and someone asks for more something has to
give. A properly configured system really shouldn't be running out of
memory anyway for most sane workloads.
It's like putting water in a bottle, at the point you have more water
than bottle something has to spill, if it doesn't the box hangs.
