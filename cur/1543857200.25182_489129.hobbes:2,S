I made a number of comments last time around, some temperate, some not.
I trust the temperate ones were addressed?
Is there really no way in which any other kernel subsystem will ever want
functionality of this nature?

I wouldn't view this as an adequate changelog for this sort of work,
frankly.  Not by a long shot.  You've told us very briefly what the patches
do.  You haven't told us why they do it, nor how they do it.
What design decisions went into this?  What options were considered and
eliminated and why?  etc.
It's just a great lump of code dumped in our laps.
From a quick scan (and I cannot review in more depth because the code is a
complete mystery to this reviewer):

That's a bizarre thing to do.  If there's really any other process which
can take that mutex, the mutex_init() just trashed it.  If there is no
other such process, the mutex_lock() is unneeded.  There should never be
a need to runtime-initialise a static mutex - just use DEFINE_MUTEX.
ecryptfs now has a dependency upon netlink.  There's no CONFIG_NETLINK.  If
CONFIG_NET=n && CONFIG_ECRYPTFS=y is possible, it won't build.
