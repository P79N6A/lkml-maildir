Neat.  Consider me surprised, then  ;-)
Don't take my message as objection to the merge.  I dunno what DaveM or 
JamesM thinks, but I definitely support merging patches like this.  It 
provides a great example, if nothing else.
Eventually I bet there will be issues about automatic algorithm 
selection:  like the RAID5 code, which benchmarks all available 
algorithms, and selects the fastest one.
