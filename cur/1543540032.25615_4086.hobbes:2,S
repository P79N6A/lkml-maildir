Doesn't look good!
1. What says that any make will always work left-to-right through a
   dependency list?
2. Since update-modverfile is only referenced in the top-level makefile,
   it seems sensible to move this there.
3. Always updating modversions.h will cause lots of files to (possibly)
   be remade unnecessarily.
4. make -j will also try to run 'rm-modverfile' and
   '$(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h' in parallel - therefore there's
   a race condition here.
I suggest doing something like:
.PHONY: $(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h
$(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h:
	@echo updating $(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h
	<<<old code to create modversions.h but as modversions.h.tmp>>>
	@cmp -s $@ $(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h.tmp || \
	 mv $(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h.tmp $@
	@rm -f $(TOPDIR)/include/linux/modversions.h.tmp
in linux/Makefile.  This way, we only actually touch modversions.h when
it has really changed.
