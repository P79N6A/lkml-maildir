It would certainly be productive to have certain system-level things in 
the kernel, such as support for interrupts and DMA, but we already have 
that in the form of DRI, and there is no other reason to put something 
like that into the kernel.  What advantage would there be that would 
outweigh all of the numerous disadvantages?
