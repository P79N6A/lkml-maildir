I'm not sure if this is the right way to react. I'd think it's okay to
give the user the possibility to scale the window so that it works with
his b0rk3d firewall, but default behavior should be to do whatever the
protocol dictates/allows.
We did the same with ECN, and I think that's the way to go.
