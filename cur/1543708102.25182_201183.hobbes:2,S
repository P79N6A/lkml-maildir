hmm, sorry, I didn't want to tantalize you with mails,
I just thought you would be interested in them ...
my apologies here, will avoid further mails to your account
my primary goal isn't to get this fixed by the gcc folks,
I want to have a simple and working solution, which seems
to be at hand for the toolchains, to cross compile the
linux kernel for testing purposes. the changes so far are
not very intrusive IMHO, and I can live with a few patches.
(btw. currently Dan Kegel has a lot more patches to gcc in 
his toolchain than I do)

sounds reasonable ... at least to me ;)

originally I had the weird? opinion, that gcc (or it's
build system) does support the cross target to exactly
do this (building an initial gcc, which can be used to
compile other stuff, like (g)libc and such) ...
that this looks like some kind of hack is neither my fault
nor does it justify messing around with 'unbuildable'
(g)libcs to get a kernel cross compile working ...
best,
Herbert
