The protected mode interface provided by the VESA BIOS is only available
for setting the CLUT registers and setting the start address of the
frontbuffer. And this is only available in x86-32.
For the other functions such as mode setting, you need to call the BIOS
in real-mode.  And unless you can persuade Linus to allow this, the
only way to do it is in userspace.
