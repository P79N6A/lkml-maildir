I get the same for the rivafb as well (looks like all the fb stuff actually)
   info->node = -1;
commenting out that line made it so it compiled and worked (well looked like
it did when using it , but may not be 100% right )
I dunno if it the right thing to do for the aty FB as well
Can anyone got a proper fix for this?
Thanks
