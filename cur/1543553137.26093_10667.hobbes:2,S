David is entitled to his opinion (IMO).
And I dislike this patch, as he and I have already discussed.
Short of fixing the link order, I like Jeff's suggestion
better (if it actually works, that is):  go back to the
way it was a few months ago by calling usb_init()
from init/main.c and making the module_init(usb_init);
in usb.c conditional (#ifdef MODULE).
