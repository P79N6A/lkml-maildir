Oh fanfuckingtastic.  Something in there is failing to reach its
termination condition.  The code has become a trainwreck, so heaven knows
what it was.
For starters, let's actually use that local variable for something.
We haven't been incrementing local variable total_scanned since the
scan_control stuff went in.

This probably won't fix it.
It looks like the code will lock up if all zones are out of unreclaimable
memory, but you won't be hitting that.
I also wonder if it'll lock up if just the first zone has ->all_unreclaimable.
I think a good starting point here will be to revert the most recent
change.
