Not wrong: You should document the interface, and any strange gotchas that
you faced while writing the function (like hardware bugs, etc). Then, if the
next person can't understand the code by reading it:
1. He's not qualified to change it.
*OR*
2. The code is crap, it needs to be rewritten anyways, good interface
documentation makes that possible.
Documenting every detail just encourages people with a paper thin
understanding to go and foul it up in subtile ways, it's better that they be
completely clueless and screw it up obviously.
Good code is simple, clean, and obvious. Sometimes, some code can't be clean
because it's facing a very hard problem, all the more reason to leave it to
gurus.
