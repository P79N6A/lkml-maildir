Rename syscall is expected to be atomic on unixoid systems. And I dont know of
a case where a problem is, besides if you use some network file system, where
nobody can realy gurantee anything (well kidding, but it is harder than on a
local one).
The second rename may see the result of the first rename or the original state
before the first rename. It will not see any half-state or locked nodes.
