And I'm 95% sure that someone here (MontaVista) has done the same thing
for Linux... ARM if my memory serves me correctly.  You'll also notice
that UDP debugging support is now in FSF GDB 5.3 snapshots.  Sure, it's
a little lossy, but it works in the useful cases.
I'm not quite sure what happened to the kernel side... but it sounds
like this could be a nice candidate for the network dumping stack, too.

Yes.  The protocol also has explicit ACKs and has the basis for
retransmission; it's not extensive but it's enough to get by over even
a lossy serial cable.
