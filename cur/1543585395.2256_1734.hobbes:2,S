You shouldn't worry too much about fragmentation within the slabcache.
It actually is designed to limit the amount of fragmentation. And the
next 100000 dentry/inode allocations will come at no cost ;)
The fact that your icache/dcache slabs are not 100% used indicates that
shrink_i/dcache_memory actually was triggered a couple of times due to
free memory shortage. In contrast, on my machine, the available and
allocated numbers are pretty much always identical. I'm probably not
putting enough VM pressure on the machine so the normal aging/pageout
mechanisms manage to free up just enough memory to avoid dentry/inode
pruning.

Did the SMTP box become unusable? Although the VM ends up working with
only the memory that is not locked up in slabs, it does a pretty good
job, as you reported yourself.

Doing an (intuitive) cost/benefit analysis, throwing out an inode does
not guarantee to free up any memory. While throwing out clean pages from
the pagecache will free up some memory and they do not necessarily have
to be read back in at all (otherwise they would have been 'active').
I've been thinking about this a bit and one possible solution would be
to significantly lower the cost of prune_icache by removing the
sync_all_inodes and only let it prune inodes that do not have any
mappings associated with them. Then it might become possible to call it
more frequently, like every time we hit do_try_free_pages.
If there is enough memory available in the system, the inodes will have
mappings and won't be removed. Once memory pressure builds up the
mappings are cleaned and pruned, by the VM system and removing the
remains of the inode should be relatively inexpensive. There is probably
something that I missed, so I should just shut up now and write the code.
