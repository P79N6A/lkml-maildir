it would have been totally appropriate for me to just send a mail to 
lkml with the proper subject line about the breakage. (I might even have 
decided to stay completely silent about the issue and fix it for my own 
build, letting you guys figure it out.)
Instead i did a search of lkml (based on the function name in the build 
error) and figured out where the pull request was on lkml: Greg. I 
replied to that mail, he'll obviously know whom else to Cc from that 
point on (if anyone). I really didnt want to (nor did i need to) figure 
out whether this was some general driver level API change that happen 
kernel-wide, or some SCSI specific change. I simply replied to the pull 
request whose Cc: line seemed well-populated to me already. I also took 
a look at the commit itself and did a quick hack in a hurry to keep the 
tests rolling. It really did not occur to me that i should have added 
anyone else to the Cc: line, as linux-pci@atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz was 
Cc:-ed already so i assumed the interest was from that angle.
( And as this was spent from my family's weekend time and i had no time
  and no interest to dig any further than to figure out the "first hop"
  of the change that broke the build, and the parties who initiated that
  hop. I'm in fact surprised that your and James's answer to my
  bugreport is hostility. )
So i find your suggestion that i should have added more people to the 
Cc: line unfair on several levels.

you mean the whole set of changes? Or just mine? Mine was a 30 seconds 
guesswork of course, i dont have the hardware, i didnt do the change, 
nor did i do anything near that code - i just saw the build failure stop 
my testing and sent in this notification and a hack. That's why i sent 
it to Greg, as a reply to the mail where he pushed these changes 
upstream and who'll know what to do with it from that point on. My patch 
can be totally thrown away (and should be, apparently).
but ... i guess next time i'll think twice before sending any bugreports 
about or related to the SCSI code anywhere, unless they become really 
annoying. Who needs this hassle?
