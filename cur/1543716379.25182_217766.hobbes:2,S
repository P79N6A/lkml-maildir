| The kernel maintainers will decide what's best for Linux.   They're the

| the message i'd prefer something along the lines of:
| 
| "Now loading a non GPL driver.   Please consider supporting vendors that
| provide open source drivers for their hardware.  Your kernel will now be
| marked as tainted, all this means is that you should send any support
| requests to the author of this driver."
I agree, this is better than the Aunt Tillie message.
(Second sentence could be omitted.  I agree with it,
but it's not in the right setting IMO.)

So why is the tainted message to be different?
