No.... not even close :-(
The really gross part is that it uses kernel-land pointers as "opaque" VC
descriptors, so basically if atmsigd goes nuts in can easily stomp all
over the kernel's memory.  Way back when I added a CAP_SYS_RAWIO check to
the ATMSIGD_CTRL ioctl so at least there's no security hole but it's still
damn gross (no offense, Werner :-)
I agree that fixing that old cruft would be a lot more productive than
trying to shoehorn the ATM devices into the netdevice framework.
