	Nice...  What's this then?

	0x3f8-0x3ff is COM1 and a 16550A is the most common invocation of the
vernerable serial port.  I haven't seen a real 8250 in ages.  the 16550
is an 8250 with larger FIFO's and better rates.
	Now, it's on IRQ5 instead of IRQ4 but that's all allocatable on PCI.
Unless I'm missing something, it looks like you've got a COM port and it
looks like it's active.
	Might be related to an IR port?
