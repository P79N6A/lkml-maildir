I was concerned about that in the beginning, and was told that CF devices
perform wear-leveling internally.  In fact, we have had units in the field
for a couple of years without failure, so my objections carried little
weight.  In practice, the filesystem isn't often written.  Since the jffs2
filesystem seems to be intertwined with the mtd drivers, there don't seem
to be any other good failure-tolerant solutions.  But, that isn't the
point for now..

Yes, this was in fact where the problem was.  In the 2.5.59 kernel, in
mm/filemap.c there were still two calls to flush_page_to_ram(), but in
include/asm-arm/proc-armv/cache.h this was defined to be a nop.  I
replaced the flush_page_to_ram() calls with flush_dcache_page() calls
and everything started working properly.
In later versions, the flush_page_to_ram() calls have been removed from
filemap.c, and I do not see any replacement of the functionality (at least
nothing that seems clear to me!)
I would like to eventually move forward to a 2.6 kernel, so I am interested
in how this is addressed there.
I also didn't seem to find (or recognize) the earlier discussion, so perhaps
it is covered there..
Anyhow, thanks for the help.  Things are rolling again!
