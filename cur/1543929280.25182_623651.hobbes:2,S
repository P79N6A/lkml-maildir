This seems to turn a molehill into a mountain.
We can change that mod_devicetable.h at any time; it's not supposed to be a 
userspace API (the kernel build system doesn't count).
So, just insert two bits of padding in sdio_device_id and insert a comment 
saying "/* Explicit padding: works even if we're cross-compiling */".
Thanks,
Rusty.
