Agreed - and that's one extra bit of control information.

The last has no business being in the serial driver though - the driver
knows nothing about frames of characters.  It's more a userland (in
which case it's TIOCM* ioctls) or ldisc issue (tty_driver->tiocmset).

You missed the point.  Of course the hardware flow control can be
disabled.  However, if you do have on-chip CTS flow control disabled
with UARTs with large FIFOs, and remote end says "stop sending", the
characters already in the FIFO will be sent, which may be up to
64 or even 128 characters instead of the usual 16 or so with the
16550A.  If the remote end only has room for 32 more characters,
you're into an overrun condition at every "stop sending" event.
Hence, people must expect a DTR/DSR software-based hardware flow
control to be less reliable than using RTS/CTS (with an adapter to
swap the RTS/CTS pins for DTR/DSR) with advanced 8250-based UARTs.
