Sometimes code motion makes code faster and/or smaller but use more
stack space.  If you want to keep the stack use down, it blocks some
other optimisations.
Register allocation is similar: code motion optimisations may use more
registers due to overlapping lifetimes, which causes more register
spills and changes the code.  The two interact; it's not trivial to
optimise fully.
