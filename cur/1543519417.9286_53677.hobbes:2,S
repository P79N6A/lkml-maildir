Yep. This one really should be addressed. I think Solar Designer has a
fix for this one, though.

I'll try to dig up some more on this one (there's probably something in
the mail-log I got from Alan; haven't read everything yet)

I can only agree. But the mail with the bug-report wasn't very exact.
I can send a copy to you if you like...

Of course, I'd like every damn user upgrade to v2.2.xx, if not for any
other reason, to make the bug-finding of v2.2.xx easier (the more people
using it, the faster bugs can be found.)
But there are lot of people (mainly companies) that either won't update
until they have finished evaluating v2.2.xx (somewhere around when we
release v2.4.5 and v2.2.25 or so...), and others that have custom-made
drivers that haven't been forward ported to v2.2.xx yet.
