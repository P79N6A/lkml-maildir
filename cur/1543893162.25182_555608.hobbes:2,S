Thanks for the corrections ;-) The whole picture is more clear now for 
me :-)
BTW,I found a really interesting blog entry about which code in Linux 
Kernel is using which version of GPL :
http://6thsenseless.blogspot.com/2007/02/how-much-linux-kernel-code-is-gpl-2.html
The work done on a Linux 2.6.20. The result is quite interesting. 
Because almost half  (Around %60 of the code licensed under "GPLv2 Only" 
and the rest is "GPLv2 or above","GPL-Version not specified,others that 
have not stated which and what version of License has been used) of the 
code is "GPLv2 or above" licensed. And also stated in the article that 
some of the codes should be "Dual Licensed" not the whole Linux kernel 
needed to be "Dual Licensed". So,if it is really like this, maybe we can 
make,for example: "File system related Codes", "Dual Licensed" and it 
will allow us to port ZFS from OpenSolaris requested by a lot of people 
or other things maybe ?
