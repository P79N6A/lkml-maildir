Well, from time to time, there are patches/suggestions on how to get the
footprint smaller. If you do embedded work, you're oftenly not
interestes in all the kernel's printk() messages. I have sent around
some patch some time ago which (in kernel.h) simply #define's a printk
to do nothing. Then, rename original printk() to your_real_printk() and
convert _really_ important printk() calls to your_real_printk(), eg.
Oops messages:-)
On a small kernel, you can save 50..100 KB (in the bzImage)! That's a
lot; think about uncompressed size!
And - there are other options as well. Just _look_ at the code, _think_
about it and (possibly) _change_ it if needed (and publish the changes
so that they're available to others).
