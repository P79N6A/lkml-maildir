I have taken a look at XFree/XOrg sources and it seems that they should
not have -1/1 problem but values outside of limits allowed for Intellimouse
or Explorer protocols will cause re-evaluation of protocol mode. We probably
just clamp values to protocol limits (-8/+7 for intellimouse and explorer
modes) and be done with it.
