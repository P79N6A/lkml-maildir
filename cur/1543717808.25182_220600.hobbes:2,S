I just read that. It's a very unfair marketing document.
Among other things, it suggests that a capability system
is stuck with about 40 bits while their own version of
capabilities (a duck is a duck...) has 80 bits. Lovely,
but not exactly groundbreaking. There is the bit about
a 3-argument security call, but a careful reading will
reveal that one argument is unused (NULL?) when dealing
with abilities like "can set the clock".
About the only thing of interest is that capability
transitions can be arbitrary. You're not limited to
an obscure set of equations that nobody can agree on.
The cost: complicated site-specific config files and
the inability to support capability-aware apps that
set+clear their own bits.
There is some value in unifying the handling of
capability bits with the handling of actor-to-actee
security controls. This simplifies the documentation,
and thus reduces the likelyhood of admin mistakes.

Eh, why? That's mostly a search-and-replace on the name,
since capable() makes a perfectly fine LSM hook.

Nice.
So what about the old-Oracle problem? You have a
server that needs the ability to hog and lock memory.
Is there an almost-empty SELinux policy that would
provide this while leaving the rest of the system
acting as UNIX-like systems have always acted?
If so, we have a winner.
One still does need to provide apps with a way to
answer "can I do FOO, BAR, and BAZ?" and "am I
running with elevated privileges?". Some way to
dispose of unneeded privileges would be good too.
Hopefully extra libraries wouldn't be needed.
