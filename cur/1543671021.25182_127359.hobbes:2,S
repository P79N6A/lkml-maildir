Hi David, Nils,
Nils, you have
	CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=y
which is correct.  David, you have
	CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT=m
which is an illegal setting.  You must have hand-edited your config file
to get this.  My guess is, the '=m' is being treated as 'not set'.
You also need to have CONFIG_INPUT (Input core support section) set.
If this is not set you will not see the CONFIG_USB_HIDINPUT question
come up in the USB section.
Regards,
Joe
