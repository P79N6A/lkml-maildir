Please also try 2.6.26-rc2 without the above patch but with the following
patch applied instead - according to comments in OpenFirmware & pata_cs5520
code 0x60 register contains bus-master enable bit, it could be that it was
left disabled by BIOS and we need to explicitely enable it (if somebody has
CX5510 or CX5520 datasheet please verify this + send me a copy if possible).
