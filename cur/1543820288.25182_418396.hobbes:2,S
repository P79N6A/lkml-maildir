Subject: xfs bug, 2.6.17-rc2: unrepairable inode created
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

2.6.17-rc2 on powerpc
Summary of failure:
        A bad inode was created that makes xfs stop on change attempts.
        xfs_repair cannot repair it.
        The creation most likely happened when running 2.6.17-rc2 on ppc.
Benjamin Herrenschmidt recommended to report this to lkml and xfs maintainers.
Attached my detailed report, 
I have the 3 GByte partition copied as file and thus can do experiments
or send part to someone, if I get detailed instructions.
Please copy me on relevant replies, I am not subscribed to the list.

Details of XFS failure happening on 20060423
to Bernhard Reiter <bernhard@intevation.de>
Summary of failure: 
	A bad inode was created that make xfs stop on change attempts.
	xfs_repair cannot repair it.
	The creation most likely happened when running 2.6.17-rc2 on ppc.
How the failure appeared:
Build and ran a 2.6.17-rc2 kernel on a ppc (PowerBook 5,6) for the first time.
gcc-Version 3.3.5 (Debian 1:3.3.5-13)
Used konqueror.
Later ran 2.6.12-rc6 to use omninet.o (which is broken in linux beyond 2.6.12).
This kernel was used often before in production without problems.
Trying to delete an entry from the inode leads to an XFS internal error.
This was a directory usually written by konqueror.
How to reproduce the bad behaviour now:
cd /var/bad/a.out
rm file.in.bad.dir

Please umount the filesystem, and rectify the problem(s)
I have copied the partition in a file with dd and
the behaviour is consistant.

I am using xfsprogs from Debian Sarge 2.6.20-1.  
Retested with a backport of 2.7.16-1, still cannot repair.
