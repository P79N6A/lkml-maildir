From: Johannes Berg <johannes@sipsolutions.net>
Lockdep reports a circular locking dependency in the hibernate code
because
 - during system boot hibernate code (from an initcall) locks pm_mutex
   and then a sysfs buffer mutex via name_to_dev_t
 - during regular operation hibernate code locks pm_mutex under a
   sysfs buffer mutex because it's called from sysfs methods.
The deadlock can never happen because during initcall invocation nothing
can write to sysfs yet. This removes the lockdep report by marking the
initcall locking as being in a different class.
