   The build of the kernel on SPARC fails when linking due to use of _muldi3
   in nfs3svc_encode_fsstatres (file fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c):
We are working on fixing this, fatfs builds provoke it too.
The fix is to add an implementation __muldi3 from libgcc.a into
arch/sparc/lib/muldi3.S
Multiplying u64's on any architecture is perfectly legal to do.
Don't change generic code to eliminate it, we'll fix Sparc.
Later,
