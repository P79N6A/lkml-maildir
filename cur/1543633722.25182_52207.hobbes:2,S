Hello,
Since upgrading to 2.4.18 (tested with later kernels too, running 
2.4.19-pre10-ac2 right now) I have the following problem: every time my 
soundchip is activated for the first time, it makes a horrible screetching 
noise. Just plain horrible. After that, playback is perfect.
In the logs i get:
NM256: Sound playback pointer invalid!
I've looked on the net for some info, but I haven't been able to find anything 
that really cures this problem.
Anything else I can try?
Thanks!
DK
