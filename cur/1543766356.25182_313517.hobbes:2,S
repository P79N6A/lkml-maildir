(Well, at that point I probably want to drop that 10% anyway :-).

Actually this one should not be a problem. "This-changeset-obsoletes:"
would probably be in changelog part, and remote end would just
propagate it.

I created three trees here (with git fork): one ("clean-git") to track
your changes, second ("linux-git") to do my development on and third
("linux-good") for good, nice, cleaned-up changes, for you to merge.
...unfortunately pasky's git just symlinked object/ directories...
...that means that if you pull from me using rsync, you'll get all my
"development" files, too. Not accessible in any normal way, but still
there.
That means that git fork can't be used for "good tree for
Linus"... not until we have something better than rsync :-(.
