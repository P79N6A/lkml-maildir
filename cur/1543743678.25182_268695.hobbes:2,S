As I understand it, anything that executes in the user-mode
environment provided by the kernel, using the kernel-provided
API(s), either through a runtime library or direct, using the
kernel interface(s), is not a derivative work of the kernel.
Anything that runs inside the kernel is a derivative work.
There used to be a "gray area" which has now been obliterated
with the new module-loading software. There is now no question
about the derivative works of a module because a module is now
data used by the kernel's built-in loading mechanism. It cannot
anymore be confused with a "program".
So, if the Broadcom router uses a linux kernel with its
built-in network routing capability, that's fair use.
If it has a user-interface program for configuring it,
that user-interface program can be considered proprietary
and its code can be private intellectual property.
If the kernel is unmodified, its source doesn't have to
be provided with the box. If there are special modules or
special modifications, then these have to be made available
if requested by any individual. The company can charge normal
distribution fees for this software source-code.
In the meantime, you can do anything you want with any
portion of linux as long as you do it in the privacy of
your own bedroom ;^;)
Cheers,
