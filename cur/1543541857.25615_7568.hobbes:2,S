It's quite possible there's logic problems but all I know is that the
ether= didn't work at all in 2.3 because of the eth%d changes.

Now, I've been on vacation for the last two weeks and I'm still on
vacation for the remainder of this week so I don't have access to my
testing environment thus cannot test and fix this until next monday.
Which I'm going to do unless someone's already fixed it.

: One of those probably needs to go - Im not really hacking 2.4 tho
: 
ether= was preserved for backwards compatibility while introducing the new
netdev= which is generic, not just ethernet specific (format for this is
same as for ether=). That is why those two piece of codes are identical. 
Now, ether= should probably be deprecated at some point but not in 2.4.
