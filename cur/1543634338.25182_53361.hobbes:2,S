Agree.  Heightened swapout in this rather simplified example) isn't a 
problem in itself, unless it really turns out to be a bottleneck in a 
wide variety of loads.  As long as the *right* pages are being swapped 
and don't have to be paged right back in again.   
I'll try a more varied set of tests tonight, with cpu usage tabulated.
