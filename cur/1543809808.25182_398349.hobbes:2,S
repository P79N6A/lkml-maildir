If I am off the mark here, forgive me.
Since I moved exclusively to GNU/Linux 2 years ago, I notice when I
update kernel I get this:
nick@linuxamd:nick$ sudo /sbin/lilo -v
LILO version 22.5.9, Copyright (C) 1992-1998 Werner Almesberger
Development beyond version 21 Copyright (C) 1999-2004 John Coffman
Released 08-Apr-2004 and compiled at 00:18:50 on May 21 2004.
Warning: LBA32 addressing assumed
Reading boot sector from /dev/hda2
Warning: Kernel & BIOS return differing head/sector geometries for device 0x80
    Kernel: 65535 cylinders, 16 heads, 63 sectors
      BIOS: 1024 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors
Warning: Kernel & BIOS return differing head/sector geometries for device 0x81
    Kernel: 29777 cylinders, 16 heads, 63 sectors
      BIOS: 1024 cylinders, 255 heads, 63 sectors
Now, from day one I never used the -v option with lilo, but as I get
more experienced (!) I do now and see the above... I have never
investigated due to worrying if I start messing with it I will trash
my disks - as I see all anyway on this disks (and no errors), all
works great/fast etc.
Is this what is going on here (re this thread?).
