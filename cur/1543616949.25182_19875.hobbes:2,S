Huh? You are referring to ntfs tng perhaps? No, this is just a small update 
to the existing ntfs driver (admittedly taken from ntfs tng but this little 
part shouldn't produce any compiler problems AFAIK).
This update makes ntfs use kmalloc instead of vmalloc for <= PAGE_SIZE 
allocations and since the majority of the allocations are <= PAGE_SIZE this 
is both a performance improvement and a decrease of load on the 128MiB 
vmalloc vm area.
There were people who reported problems under load due to failing vmallocs 
and concurrent ldt allocation problems. This patch should address those 
problems.
Best regards,
Anton
