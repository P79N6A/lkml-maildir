The list-based approach's best-case are large continuous append writes.  
No sorting overhead, and light data structures.
i'd say this workload should be not that bad under the radix tree either 
- the gang lookup stuffs a nice vector of 16 pages into an array.
we definitely can say nothing based on the observation that a _single_ 
page took 1.9 msecs in Lee's previous measurement, while 7700 pages now 
take 6 msecs to process.

the generic VM/pagecache has proven that the radix tree wins hands down 
for alot more workloads than the worst-case.

that was my other point in a previous mail: most write benchmarks do 
continuous append writes, and CPU overhead easily gets lost in network 
latency.
Also, considering that a good portion of the NFS client's code is still 
running under the BKL one would assume if the BKL hurts performance it 
would have been changed by now? ;-)
