Could it be they are looking for the Linux 2.4 header file
include/linux/wrapper.h, which contains in its entirety:
====================== begin snip ======================
#ifndef _WRAPPER_H_
#define _WRAPPER_H_
#define mem_map_reserve(p)      set_bit(PG_reserved, &((p)->flags))
#define mem_map_unreserve(p)    clear_bit(PG_reserved, &((p)->flags))
#endif /* _WRAPPER_H_ */
====================== end snip ======================
Without this, I don't see offhand how either of the files:
    sound/oss/au1000.c
    sound/oss/ite8172.c
could be compiled, as they seem to use these mem_map_[un]*reserve() macros.
