What distribution are you using?  What's the hardware configuration,
including amount of memory?  What is the partition table look
like for /dev/sda?  What filesystems are mounted?  If you have any
soft RAID partitions, are any of them using part of /dev/sda?  What
swap partitions are you using?  And do any of the swap partitions
overlap with /dev/sda?  :-)
