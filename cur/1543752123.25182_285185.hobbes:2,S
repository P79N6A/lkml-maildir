Hello!
I am trying to understand how NetApp can be so much
better at NFS servicing than my quad Opteron 250 SAN
attached machine.  So I need some help and some
pointers to understand how I can make my opteron
machine come on par (or within 70% NFS performance
range) as that of my NetApp R200.  I have run through
the NFS-how-to's and have heard "that is why they cost
so much more", but I really have to consider that
probably most of the ideas that are in the NetApp are
common knowldge (just not in my head).
Can anyone shed some light on this?
TIA!
Phy
