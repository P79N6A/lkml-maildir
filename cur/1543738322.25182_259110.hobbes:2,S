Subject: [BUG] ia32 ptrace on x86-64 broken for syscalls with 6 parameters

Running an ia32 strace on x86-64 to look at an ia32 application which
uses syscalls which have six parameters (e.g., mmap2, fadvise64_64)
shows that the values reported to strace are bogus.  The very same
program, strace, and glibc binaries on an ia32 machine show the correct
result.  The system call (I tried mmap2) is also correctly executed.
I.e., it is the ptrace interface.
This happens with both, em64t and amd64 machines.  In both cases the
vsyscall DSO was used.
This is with the current FC kernel which corresponds to rc3-bk6.
