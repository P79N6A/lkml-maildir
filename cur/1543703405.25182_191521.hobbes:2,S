Hello,
I have just taken the plunge and built 2.6.1 for my desktop K6-200, 430TX.
With the preempt, it is certainly faster than 2.4 and the memory/swap
usage is much less. Great!
However, I have noticed a couple of problems:
I have a 3com NIC. But the module usage count for 3c59x  stays at 0 even
when eth0 is up. 
Secondly, I cannot run lilo under 2.6.1. I get
Device 0x0300: Invalid partition table, 2nd entry
  3D address:     1/0/773 (779184)
  Linear address: 1/0/6184 (6233472)
Runs  fin under 2.4. There is a difference in the way the disk geometries
are reported on boot.
2.4 reports:
Jan 15 08:00:17 titan kernel: hda: 6835952 sectors (3500 MB), CHS=847/128/63, UDMA(33)
Jan 15 08:00:17 titan kernel: hdb: 40031712 sectors (20496 MB) w/512KiB Cache, CHS=2491/255/63, UDMA(33)
and 2.6.1:
Jan 15 08:19:56 titan kernel: hda: 6835952 sectors (3500 MB), CHS=6781/16/63, UDMA(33)
Jan 15 08:19:56 titan kernel: hdb: 40031712 sectors (20496 MB) w/512KiB Cache, CHS=39714/16/63, UDMA(33)
I have 
# CONFIG_IDEDISK_STROKE is not set
but according to the help, I shouldn't need it as the disk is less than
32MB. 
Award BIOS.
Do let me know if you need any other info on this.
Mark
