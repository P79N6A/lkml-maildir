We should make sure now that we are able to go to a 32-bit pid_t if
we think we may ever do this, likewise for large dev_t and ino_t
values for things like stat.
Yes, I know we have padding now -- but do we have enough padding in
all the right places to endure we are not going to require yet
another ABI in the kernel in the next year or two?
