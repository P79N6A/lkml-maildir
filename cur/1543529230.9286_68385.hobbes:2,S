Hi,
I'm trying to load linux 2.2.14 using loadlin1.6a.  No luck so far, I'm 
getting kernel Ooops,  though it works fine for 2.0.x  kernels.  Is it 
possible to boot 2.2.14 with loadlin1.6a?
Lilo is not an option, as my system is only stable when VIA-based 
motherboard is first initialized in Win98, if interested you can find 
details in:

Thank you,
Sasha.
