If you need to mirror it - then you have an empty mirror disk ready, right?
Create a degraded array on the mirror disk, then make a fs there. Then
copy everything over from the original partition.  After this, change
the original partition to raid and add it to the other array. (It will
then be updated from the copy). 
This approach works with all filesystems, including those that
cannot be resized.  Data is copied twice instead of once, but
teh copying step will defragment files and you have the option
of changing filesystem or take advantage of sparse files if
you so wish.
