Subject: [PATCH] initio driver update
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The initio a100 driver has not worked for some time now (needed updating 
to the DMA mapping API).  This patch implements an update to the DMA 
mapping API plus fixes a lot of obvious problems I saw in the driver (I'm 
sure more exist).  I don't have hardware to test this, so testers would 
be *much* appreciated.  It compiles, that's all I guarantee until testers 
step forward.  However, it can't be any worse than the old version since 
the old version wouldn't compile.  Linus, please apply this (and let me 
know if you don't like pulling patches this way, it was too big to send 
to the mailing lists).  Thanks.
