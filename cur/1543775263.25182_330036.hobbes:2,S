Hi Darry,
first of all thanks for your questions, and sorry for answering late, 
I've been away for some time.

I am using a self-made initramfs setup using the "standard" binaries 
from the live system, usable for instance as rescue system with tools 
identical to anything I have installed, including bash as shell for the 
init script, udev, module-init-tools, lvm2, mdadm, and so on and so 
forth. There are only the most basic device nodes in the supplied /dev 
tree, like null, console, etc.
Unfortunately, I don't really "see" modprobe exit, it just takes less 
time until the "modprobe $mod && e_done" prints its "done." yet related 
device nodes are still missing. Waiting for any required nodes fixes the 
problem so far, but maybe bash-3.00 is having a similar issue as nash. 
I'll try using sash or busybox ASAP to check if the problem is somewhere 
else.
The funny thing is that with kernels up to 2.6.11.12, I don't see this 
problem. The patch mentioned further up this thread was against 
2.6.11-rc1 and should have been applied long before I even touched 
2.6.11, so I just don't understand why I have problems now.

Well, so far I cannot distinguish both of these cases, but it definitely 
is _not_ the third one:

Otherwise I would not run into problems like mdadm failing trying to 
assemble arrays while disk nodes are still missing in action.

Thanks for the patch, I'll look into similarities in the bash code if 
the shell really is the cause of my trouble.
