This is definitely a job for XFree86, and Xv specificially.
Unfortunately, Xv only support the YUV->RGB conversion.  For the fancier
stuff, you'll need to use XvMC (motion compensation) which is still
somewhat experimental.
Redirect this question to the XFree86 devel lists and I think you'll get
better results.  Good luck on getting this supported!
