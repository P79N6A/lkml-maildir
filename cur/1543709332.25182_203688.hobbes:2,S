Not sure about it being "official".
It may make sense if it's a distribution - many users don't install
kernel sources. Still, from a technical point of view, it should be
a straight copy of kernel includes - we don't want to maintain two
separate sets, do we?

Then they should be fixed.
I.e. parts for internal kernel use should be wrapped with #ifdef __KERNEL__.
Personally I consider every kernel header which prevents successful
user space compilation buggy.

Precisely. This is why we need just one header set.

Not sure about it. How is it different from clean "kernel" headers
shipped (obviously) with the kernel?
The "non-problem" here is, IMHO, that the cleaning of kernel headers
is quite trivial, and thus nobody is interested :-)
