This sort of code (not your patch, but the code itself) pisses me off --
these are magic numbers and I cannot evaluate their correctness at all
without having the spec in one hand.
I would __REALLY__ like to see someone grab a spec and define symbolic
constants for the various bits being set here.
The code above, IMNSHO, the THE REASON why there is so much randomness
and brokenness in all the tulip drivers right now.

Yes, this is another problem.  The plan is to port the Sparc64 'ethtool'
and interface to be generally available.  This will allow users a
generic way to set/correct ther media settings.

Anybody wanna send me one?

I strongly dislike having two drivers, and want to get everything
working with the new driver.  The biggest obstacle to this task is the
above -- someone needs to go through the Tulip spec(s), and replace
magic numbers with constants.
Does anyone have a 21041 spec (or URL), too?  I can only find the spec
for the new 21143...
