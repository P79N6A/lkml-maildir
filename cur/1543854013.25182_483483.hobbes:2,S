If so then that's a bug in oprofile or the x86-64 kernel.
I just checked the 2.6.18 i386 kernel + the perfctr kernel
extension, and the NMI watchdog did start ticking again when
perfctr called release_lapic_nmi().
Before the {reserve,release}_lapic_nmi() API went into the
kernel the NMI watchdog might not have resumed, but that was
ages ago (the 2.6.6 kernel).
