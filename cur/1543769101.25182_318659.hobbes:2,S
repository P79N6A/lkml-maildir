Right, the SGI boxes have discontiguous memory within a node, but it's 
not represented by pgdats (like you said, one 'virtual memmap' spans 
the whole address space of a node).  Sparse can help simplify this 
across platforms, but has the potential to be more expensive for 
systems with dynamically sized holes, due to the additional calculation 
and potential cache miss associated with indexing into the correct 
memmap (Dave can probably correct me here, it's been awhile).  With a 
virtual memmap, you only occasionally take a TLB miss on the struct 
page access after indexing into the array.

Yes!

Yeah, makes sense for the NUMA aware slab allocator to depend on 
CONFIG_NUMA.
