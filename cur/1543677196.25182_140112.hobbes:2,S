What prevents a race between the increment and the return (i.e. you
return v->counter after another person also increments it)? Only the
increment is guaranteed atomic.
I think you need to copy the result of the increment into a local
variable _inside_ of the LOCK and return that. Whether or not that will
work sanely on all architectures I dunno.
