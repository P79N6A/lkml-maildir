Look at Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt, section "Types of DMA mappings"
Read it again from the start. If you aren't familiar with PCI, 
http://ww.google.com/search?hl=en&q=PCI
+dual+address+cycle+explanation may
help. Then look at drivers/net/{epic/eepro100/3c59x}.c and grep for the
functions quoted in DMA-mapping.txt. After that, glue all the pieces in 
your head.
