Given that it's only just gone in, it's going to take a while for it to
trickle through peoples conciousnesses.  Many people aren't aware of this
change yet - I'm picking people up when I review their patches at the
moment.
September 2007 should, by my estimation, be around the time of the
2.6.23-rc releases, so people have two kernel versions to fix their stuff
up.  That's not unreasonable.
Finally, a date by when people have to have their code updated or it
breaks is more managable from the point of view of planning - you
know when it's potentially going to happen.  You don't know when the
2.6.23 release is going to be, except "sometime in the last half of
this year."
