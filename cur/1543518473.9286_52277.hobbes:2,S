Subject: 2.2.13: Kernel panic: scsi_free:Trying to free unused memory
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/1999/12/8/235

Sorry if this is a known issue, I scanned the mailing list archives,
saw this problem quite a bit, but couldn't find any resolution
mentioned.
This seems to be quite readily reproducible...  I'll be happy to make
any changes/tests that anyone might suggest, as this is (currently ;-) a
testing machine...
CONFIGURATION:
Kernel 2.2.13 plus Tekram DC390 patch (dc390x_ncr) from tekram FTP site
Kernel compiled with gcc 2.7.2.3
ASUS P5A socket 7 - single CPU motherboard 128MB Ram
Tekram DC390U2B Ultra2 PCI SCSI host adapter
Mandrake 6.0, except gcc backed off to v2.7.2.3.
An IDE drive hosts all of the OS, system is stable when compiling, etc.
Kernel panic: scsi_free:Trying to free unused memory
In swapper task - not syncing
At that point the machine is locked totally solid, absolutely no
response to keystrokes.  Unfortunately the Oops messages are nowhere
to be found, if there's a way to grab them, I'm all ears...
I've pasted the log below, the scenario shown is from a reboot after a
previous crash.  Try to mount the affected partition, get errors about
mounting unchecked fs, kick self for forgetting to run e2fsck first, so
umount the partition, then run e2fsck, and that's when it panic'ed...
Should you wish to contact me please reply via email .
Many Thanks
Max
