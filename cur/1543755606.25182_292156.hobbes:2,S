In practice I don't think it will make any significant difference. What
the code should do depends on what you want to happen if you move the
mouse pointer 1/2 pixel with one finger stroke, then move it another 1/2
pixel with a second stroke. The patch I posted will move the pointer one
pixel in this case and your code will move it 0 pixels. (The X driver does
not reset the fractions, but that doesn't of course mean that it's the
only right thing to do.)

The code was written like that to emphasize the fact that X and Y use the
same formula, with the only difference that the kernel Y axis is mirrored
compared to the touchpad Y axis.
It didn't make any difference for the generated assembly code though,
using gcc 3.4.2 from Fedora Core 3.

The enum is much nicer than my #define.
