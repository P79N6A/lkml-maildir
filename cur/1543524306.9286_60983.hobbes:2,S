Maybe this is a dumb question, but is there a reason for the
drivers/misc directory to still exist?  It still shows up in the
configuration menu (I usually use menuconfig), but when you select it
nothing happens (kind of confusing).
Maybe for the moment, as long as nothing is in there, just removing misc
from the SUB_DIRS line in drivers/Makefile would be good enough.

I don't speak for anybody but myself - that's enough trouble.
