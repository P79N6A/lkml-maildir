It seems that gcc-2.7.2.3 is terminally ill. I'd rather change
Documentation/Changes, and just document the fact.
These kinds of subtle work-arounds for gcc bugs are not really acceptable,
nor is it worthwhile complaining when somebody does development with a gcc
that is _not_ broken, and doesn't notice that some random gcc bug breaks
the kernel for others.
