You write a 'serio' driver for those keyboards - a driver which will do
the bit-banging on the parallel port and send bytes from and to the
device. See the parkbd.c module for that.
The keyboard/mouse driver always sees the bytes that are on the wire,
regardless whether there is an 8042 inbetween - in that case the 8042
driver tries to undo the damage caused by translation.
This way we can have a single atkbd.c driver for any at-style keyboard
attached over whatever interface is in the machine.
