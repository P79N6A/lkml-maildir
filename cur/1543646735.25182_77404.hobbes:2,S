We use 2.4.18 on embedded systems. 2.4.19 has some new
problems (The reported select() on network I/O, being
one of them). If 2.5 becomes "stable", I should be able
to use it as long as it can be booted off a 1.2 MB floppy.
Our embedded systems don't boot off floppies, but my
BIOS NVRAM-virtual disk emulates a floppy so I don't
have any problems with compatibility. We don't do any
"execute-in-place" stuff. Linux "thinks" it was booted
off a floppy and the executables run off a RAM Disk. This
makes development and maintenance easy and allows untouched
kernels to be used.
There are absolutely no changes to the kernel. We use a
lot of modules, many (most) of which would never exist in
a Linux distribution so we are not witholding anything to,
as some say, screw, anybody.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
