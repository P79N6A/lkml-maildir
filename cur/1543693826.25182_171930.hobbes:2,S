Does anybody build X86 without CONFIG_PCI?
Build fails if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640 is set:
drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x59df): In function `ide_setup':
: undefined reference to `cmd640_vlb'
drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x5aef): In function `probe_for_hwifs':
: undefined reference to `ide_probe_for_cmd640x'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
The problem is that these variables are defined in
drivers/ide/pci/cmd640.c, which is protected by CONFIG_PCI; but they're
used when CONFIG_BLK_DEV_CMD640, which doesn't require CONFIG_PCI.

More interesting (to me) is that it also fails if CONFIG_ACPI is set:
drivers/built-in.o(.init.text+0x825): In function `acpi_bus_init':
: undefined reference to `eisa_set_level_irq'
drivers/acpi/bus.c:
#ifdef CONFIG_X86
        /* Ensure the SCI is set to level-triggered, active-low */
        if (acpi_ioapic)
                mp_config_ioapic_for_sci(acpi_fadt.sci_int);
        else
                eisa_set_level_irq(acpi_fadt.sci_int);
#endif
Should we not be calling eisa_set_level_irq()?
thanks,
