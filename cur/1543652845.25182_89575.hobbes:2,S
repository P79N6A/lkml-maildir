The RCU part is fairly simple - you want to avoid having to acquire
a lock for every NMI event to walk the handler so you do it
lockfree. If a process running in a different CPU tries to
free an nmi handler, it removes it from the list, issues an
rcu callback (to be invoked after all CPUs have gone through
a context switch or executed user-level code ensuring that the
deleted nmi handler can't be running) and waits for completion of
the callback. The rcu callback handler wakes it up.
It is all hidden under list_add_rcu()/list_del_rcu() and __list_for_each_rcu().
