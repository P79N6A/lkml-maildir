The recommended (by Linus) way for dealing with ring buffers
like that is to always read the counter through an accessor
and don't care about the overflow when updating it.
You can write small access functions for that:
struct my_struct {
	...
	unsigned rbuf_index;
	unsigned rbuf_mask;
	...
};
static inline unsigned int my_index(struct my_struct *p)
{
	return p->rb_index & p->rb_mask;
}
static inline unsigned int my_index_next(struct my_struct *p)
{
	return (++p->rb_index) & p->rb_mask;
}
