I've tried to do this again and discovered that it's much harder to do
then it used to be.  
Start mpg123 with no buffer parameter.
Then start a kernel compile.
Mpg123 will skip as the disk usage gets heavy.
Somewhere between 2.2.8 and 2.3.4 something drastically reduced the sound
dropouts on my system. I used to be able to make the sound skip even with 
"mpg123 -b 1024" but that is no longer the case.
