To some extent it's done already.  Look for Pavel Machek's podfuk
package.  fwiw, I have a similar project on the back burner.
See also various solutions that work by interception open() etc. in user
space: Midnight Commander's VFS, Gnome's VFS (based on MC's), and a few
others.  Pavel's web site points the way.
