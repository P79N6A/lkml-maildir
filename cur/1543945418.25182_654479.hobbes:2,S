Subject: [PATCH 25/30] r/o bind mounts: make access() use new r/o helper
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/15/457

It is OK to let access() go without using a mnt_want/drop_write() pair because
it doesn't actually do writes to the filesystem, and it is inherently racy
anyway.  This is a rare case when it is OK to use __mnt_is_readonly()
directly.
