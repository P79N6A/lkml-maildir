What are you protecting against, though? synchroinze_kernel can
sleep, so local_irq_disable is probably the wrong thing to do as well.
AFAIKS, you don't need anything here - so long as you have mutual
exclusion from other sched-domain building then this can take as long
as it wants / be preempted as many times as we like.

OK.
But if we want this to be a respectable interface (possibly for more than
just cpusets) then it should probably do some locking itself. It isn't
performance critical, so I think taking a semaphore wouldn't hurt.
