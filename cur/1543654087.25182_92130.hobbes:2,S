perfctr-2.4.2 is now available at the usual place:
http://www.csd.uu.se/~mikpe/linux/perfctr/
The perfctr-2.4 branch is again the main branch. The perfctr-3.1
branch is suspended since (a) it's only purpose was to be a cleaned
up version for the 2.5 kernel, (b) it was ignored w/o comment, and
(c) it removed too many features (module support, old kernels support)
in its attempt to be as clean as possible.
Proper support for hyper-threaded P4s is next on my TODO list.
Version 2.4.2, 2002-11-25
- Fixed a driver bug where it could fail to prevent simultaneous
  use of global-mode and per-process performance counters.
- Made the driver safe for preemptible 2.5 kernels.
- New patches for RedHat update kernels 2.2.22-6.2.2, 2.2.22-7.0.2,
  2.4.18-18.7.x, and 2.4.18-18.8.0.
