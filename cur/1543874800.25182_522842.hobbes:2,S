Well, you'd better get used to it.  As I told you a few weeks ago, once this
code is merged into mainline you no longer own the master copy of the blackfin
tree - Linus does.
If you're not careful, you'll end up submitting patches which revert other
people's fixes.   And there's an excellent chance that you will submit patches
which have dependencies on other stuff in your private tree and which are
insufficiently-tested-against, and possibly incorrect-against Linus's tree.
