	Hi!
  When I booted freshly compiled linux-2.4.3 on my SMP machine, during some
compilling (make -j2 in gtk+ sources) the machine reboots. There were some
other processes running: trplayer (command line realaudio player), some
bashes and midnight-commanders. XFree86 wasn't running. Reboots were
spontaneous - no messages in logs nor on console. I've tried booting once
again and tried compilling gtk+. After cca 10 seconds the machine rebooted.
  I've tried booting with and without 'nmi_watchdog' option reboots were
still happening. Also tried 'noapic' option and the system seems to be solid
(3days now).
  Are there any known problems with APIC in recent kernels?
	Thanks,
