Well... It reflects a requirement that was just as present in the
caching models that we use for NFSv2/v3, but that we glossed over for
other reasons.
The real difference here is that v2/v3 caching model assumes that you
have sufficient resolution in the ctime/mtime to allow clients to detect
any changes to the file/directory contents, whereas NFSv4 allows you to
use an arbitrary variable (that may be the ctime, if it has sufficient
resolution) for the same purposes.

You need to increment is any time that you detect remotely visible
changes.
IOW: any change that posix mandates should result in a ctime update,
must also result in an update of i_version. The only difference is that
i_version must not suffer from the time resolution issues that ctime
does.

If lustre wants to be exportable via pNFS (as Peter Braam has suggested
it should), then it had better be able to return a change attribute that
is compatible with the NFSv4.1 spec...
