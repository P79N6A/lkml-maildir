  I think current kernel do provide hotplug events for each partition, the
key problem is as Linus said, the most hardware will not give a event when
media changes.  So I just use a stupid way(just like "use a big button"),
pull out first and then plug in the flashdriver when changing the media 
or inserting a media to an empty driver. Then udev can remove the old 
node for and create new node for new media.
