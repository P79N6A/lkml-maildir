Hi,
heres a bit of a bugreport, I'm using a Hitachi visionbook plus 5000,
with a 3com 3c589 pcmcia network card (normally compiled in - not as a
module).
It works fine (great even) with 2.3.99pre1, but 2.3.99pre2 (with the
shm.c compile fix) doesn't work anymore:
on startup it tries to load the 3c589_cs module , but it fails with the
errormessage 3c589_cs: RequestIRQ: Resource in use. 
so no bit deal i figured i'll recompile with 3c589_cs as a module
there's no change..
after startup the 3c589_cs module is loaded, but ifconfig eth0
192.168.3.20 tells me "No such device"
so I rmmod 3c589_cs
and modprobe 3c589_cs (no error message)
ifconfig still doesnt work
so I rmmod 3c589_cs again
remove the card from the slot (beep)
put it back in (beep)
then the errormessage: 3c589_cs: RequestIRQ: Resource in use. shows up
again
so is there anything i should try/upgrade ?
please cc me as Im not currently subscribed to the list.
also on a side note :-)
I bought a no-name (phoebe micro or something) USB webcam on sunday
figuring i may have to develop drivers etc. for it, so I plugged it in
yesterday,
loaded the USB modules (i compiled them cause i was planning to play
with it when i got a usb device) and presto, it detected the device.
All i needed to do was recompile with the Linux video support and voila,
the webcam/framegrab software etc. works great.
excellent job on the USB and webcam drivers. (this is all on the above
mentioned laptop)
I'll be trying it on my Abit BP6 tonight.
