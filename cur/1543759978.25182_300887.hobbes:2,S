Hello
	I am wondering if someone could provide information as to how
thread_struct is kept in memory. Robert Love mentions that it is kept
at the "lowest"  kernel address in case of x86 based platform. Could
anyone answer these questions.
a)	When a stack is resized, is the thread_struct structure copied onto
a new place?
b)	What is the advantage of this scheme as against a fixed "virtual-address"?
c)	Also could you kindly point the relevant files which do all this
stuff "shed.c"(?)
TIA
