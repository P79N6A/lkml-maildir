Ext3 uses the journal to guarantee that the bitmap blocks are
consistent with the inode.  Ext2 will require that e2fsck be run to
fix the consistency problem.

If you have a power failure right after the close, the data could be
lost.  This is true for pretty much all Unix filesystems, for
performance reasons.  If you care about the data hitting disk, the
application must use fsync().
