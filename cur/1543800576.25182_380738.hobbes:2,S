I've just realized a more serious reason why this scheduler modification 
needs to be postponed as unsuitable for general use.  It essentially 
relies on sched_clock() having at least microsecond resolution and it 
has been pointed out to me that on some systems this isn't true and, 
even though its units are always nanoseconds, the resolution of 
sched_clock() can be large as 1/HZ.  This scheduler would not work very 
well on these systems so its time has not yet come regardless of 
successful resolution of the other problems.
Nevertheless, I'll add a scheduler based on ingosched with this 
modification (and fixes) to PlugSched so that progress can be made on 
improving it for those systems where it is feasible.
