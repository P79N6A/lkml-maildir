It relies on infrastructure which is not present in Linus's kernel.  We
should only be interested in fixing mainline 2.6.x.
Furthermore I'd like to see the direct-vs-buffered locking fixes fully
implemented against Linus's tree, not -mm.  They're almost there, but are
not quite complete.  Running off and making it dependent on the retry
infrastructure is not really helpful.
