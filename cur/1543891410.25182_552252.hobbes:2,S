That only applies to allocations with constant sizes. One presumes
nobody is explicitly doing kmalloc(0), so we can use a separate
runtime-computed-size path to do poisoning. (Which is probably 90% of
the problem, since people who kmalloc(sizeof(struct foo)) will generally
stay within bounds without too much effort.)
