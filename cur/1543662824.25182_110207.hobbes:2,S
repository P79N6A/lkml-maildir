I'd rather replace it, but your point about irq-safeness is a good one. 
Clearly signal sending cannot take the task lock if we want to keep it 
irq-unsafe.
So the signal stuff probably does need to be protected by _both_ the 
tasklist lock and the provate task lock.

Looks like none. And I think it was Ingo who removed it. Ingo?
