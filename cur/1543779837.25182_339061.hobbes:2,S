I'd appreciate it. It's almost like some power stepping that's responsible. 
I've never seen it happen on any intel processor (including the pentiumM ones 
which have truckloads of power saving features). I've asked many people if 
they're running some equivalent of cool'n'quiet or powernow* and they all 
insist they're not... I'm not that familiar with all the powersaving techs 
though.
Cheers,
Con
