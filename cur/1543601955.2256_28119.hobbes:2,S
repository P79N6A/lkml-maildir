Personally I'd suggest NOT getting into the habit of using killall.  It
performs like killall5 does on SysV machines.  So if you forget which
machine you're on....
My personal favorite for years was /bin/kill <process name>.  However, it
depends on which package your system actually uses for /bin/kill (the kill
from util-linux can kill by name, the procps one can not).
Lately I've been trying to train myself into using skill (from procps).
