Actually, as a couple people have pointed out to me, the version on my site 
was somehow a .19 version.  I've placed the real .20 on my site as of a few 
  minutes ago, so please try with it (and the real .20 should solve the 
problem you are related Andris in that it won't allow the driver to accept 
signals during close, which is why /dev/dsp would quit working for you).
