Though we have no reported problems, we are carrying a local patch to  
the pata_artop driver:
http://trac.nslu2-linux.org/kernel/browser/trunk/patches/2.6.22/15-
 
nas100d-pata-artop-single-port.patch
This used to be because of a long delay when probing the non-existent  
second ATA port on these embedded ARM devices, but the comment in the  
patch has since been updated suggesting some negative interaction  
with USB (??).
I don't have this machine so can't comment further on this issue,
