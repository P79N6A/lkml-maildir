Doesn't /dev/urandom have exactly the same DOS properties as /dev/random?
I.e. it reads real random numbers until the entropy pool is empty, then 
starts returning pseudo-random numbers?  If so, things on the host will 
still hang when they then try to read /dev/random.
Also, UML processes deserve crytographically secure numbers just as much as 
host proceses do.  When something opens /dev/random, /dev/random is exactly
what it should get.
