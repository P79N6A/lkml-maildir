Well duh, of course not. Whether a given request is executed in 48-bit
or not is a check that _includes_ drive capabilities too of course.

Then it just puts a taskfile request on the request queue and lets it
reach the drive, nicely syncronized with the other requests. There's no
need to toggle any special bits for that.
