It happens before the OOM can kill the system. It happens before my process
causes other users to loose theirs.
You obviously haven't used a large multiuser system recently. Quotas are
applied in almost every location I've seen. Why - to prevent one users
job from interfereing with other users jobs.
If you were running a simulation/analysis and were supposedly given
resources to run, and I accessed the same system with the same goal in
mind, which user gets killed when I use up the resources given to me?
BTW, I have the same priority of access to the system that you have...
Who gets killed - your process or mine?
Which is the correct one?
How do you know it is the correct one?
If it happens again, are the answers the same?
