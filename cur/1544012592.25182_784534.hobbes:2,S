Grrr..
  security/keys/keyctl.c: In function ‘keyctl_negate_key’:
  security/keys/keyctl.c:976: warning: ‘dest_keyring’ may be used uninitialized in this function
  security/keys/keyctl.c: In function ‘keyctl_instantiate_key’:
  security/keys/keyctl.c:898: warning: ‘dest_keyring’ may be used uninitialized in this function

Yes, it's possible that this is just a bogus warning, with gcc-4.3.2 for
