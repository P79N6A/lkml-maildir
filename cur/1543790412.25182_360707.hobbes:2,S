This is an X hang.. and I'd seriously doubt it has anything to do with
the kernel at that point..
A really hacky patch somehow has made its way into X.org releases from
a few vendors and it seems to break PCI GART system really badly on
first boot... I'm not the happiest person with RH/Dell/ATI engineering
at the moment who were all involved....
Benh is working on fixing this up in X.org but I've no idea how long
it will take to reach the real world...
Dave.
