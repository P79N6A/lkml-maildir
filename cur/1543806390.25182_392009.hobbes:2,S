Possibly, but what you'll find is that many different embedded platforms
end up wanting similar behavior, and if they all do it on their own, that
ends up in a mess.
Take the Alchemy platform for example - we have a bank of LEDs at our
disposal, and we too would like to use them to do very similar things
as the ARM/Xscale folks - things like show IDE/SD/MTD traffic, or the 
status of a battery.   Rather then go in and hack that stuff in ourselves, 
I would much rather just define a few API hooks and getting the rest for 
free (or really cheap).
Perhaps it can be hidden behind a CONFIG_EMBEDDED or something so that
the desktop platforms aren't bothered by it, but speaking for the two 
embedded platforms I'm attached to, my vote for this LED class is a "yes".
