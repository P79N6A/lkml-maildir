Hmm.
How about providing a way to stop kernel (or filesystem) to make gaps
in files instead?  Like some ioctl(fd, FS_NOGAPS, 1) -- pretty much
like 'doze has, just the opposite (on windows, this flag is "on" by
default).
Fixing this issue in samba means that samba has to keep/track more state
data than it currently does.  Detecting such seek+write has some costs.
It's even worse: imagine samba transforms this into write(zeros) (as
preallocate isn't available yet), and at the same time, another process
is writing there... Which will be perfectly valid in current case, but
will go wrong way (overwriting just-written data with zeros) in this
new scenario.
But the main point is that samba has to keep track of things which it
doesn't do now, and those things becomes.. interesting (difficult if
at all possible to track) in multi-user/concurrent-writes environment.
