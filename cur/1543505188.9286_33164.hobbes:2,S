Hello all,
I have previously also mailed in the morning. I have got a slightly different problem now.
The compilation and making of new initrd works fine with a patch installation on RH 6.0 machine with 2.2.5-15. I copied the System.map and vmlinuz files. BUt after reboot the machine stops at find modules dependencies. THis is happening to 2 machines on which I tried and I feel I am repeating the same mistake. Can any one help me?
Thanks.
