Hi!
I have created a website to point out the main issues with removable
devices and unmounting - a place to collect information and to discuss
possible solutions.
http://www.scheinwelt.at/~norbertf/petition/
Please help me improving it, add your comments and links, discuss it...
Work in progress...
Thanks,
Norbert
