Hmm, both can be the case at the moment. We need to decide, if we want to
mandate the use of a sysfs attribute instead of the string value as the signal.

That's a valid point, right. If we don't use "verbs" as the signal string,
and know what we can expect from that particular kind of event, we don't
know which attribute has changed.
The remaining questions are:
o Do we want the multicast - "channels" for the events? It may be nice, to
  have it, if a application only interested in e.g. hotplug events, can get
  only the interesting events?
o What kind of signal do we need? A lazy string, a well defined set like
  ADD/REMOVE/CHANGE?
  Or can we get rid of the whole signal? But how can we distinguish between
  add and remove? Watching if the sysfs file comes or goes is not a option,
  I think.
Thanks,
Kay
