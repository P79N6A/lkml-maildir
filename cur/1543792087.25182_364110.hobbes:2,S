Ah, of course, yes.  pagetable pages which come from slab have a live
page.lru even while the memory is in use by the caller.

I suspect a slab-based fix/workaround would be unpleasant.  Simpler to not
use slab for pagetable pages.
I doubt if there's much benefit to pagetable-pages-in-slab, really.  It
_used_ to make sense because slab has the per-cpu LIFO magazines.  But now
the page allocator has them too, it's probably better to rely upon that
magazine to provide cache-warm pages.

yup, when I can get the steaming pile to compile.
