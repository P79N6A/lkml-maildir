Just want to make clear, I wasn't taking about reusing 2.0, 2.1 ..
but just continue from 2.6 as the following example:
   2.6.16   => 2.7.0
   2.6.16.1 => 2.7.1
   2.6.16.2 => 2.7.2
   2.6.17   => 2.8.0
   2.6.18   => 2.9.0
   ...
The development model stays exactly the same:
i.e. 2.X.0 kernels are released every ~N weeks by Linus.
