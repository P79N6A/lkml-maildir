Hi Everyone!
Quota Hash Abstraction provides more flexibility for all
kinds of quota extensions (for example mount point quota, 
or quota domains), while retaining full compatibility to
the current quota hash implementation.
This is the final patch, which completes the Quota Hash 
Abstraction by adding refcounting (dqhget/dqhput) to the 
quota hashes (garbage collection), and proper handling 
of inexistent (NULL) hashes ...
QHA is now available for 2.4.22 and 2.6.0, so it should
be quite easy to give it a try ... so please if somebody 
does some performance checks on this code, send me a copy 
of the results ...
enjoy,
Herbert
