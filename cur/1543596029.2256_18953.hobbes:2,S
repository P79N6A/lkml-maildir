	there are patches for plug-able TCP/IP stacks.
	filesystems are already plug-able (someone need journaling, some one needs
quoatas, some needs nothing).
	there are patches for plug-able task scheduler.
	If I could choose what filesystem to run on / - it impact performance greatly
- why can't I choose how my tasks are scheduled? how my packets are going to
NIC?
	IMHO great idea. I think this will improve portability. And embeded guys will
be in permanent satisfaction ;-)
	But I'm afraid this won't happen in 2.5 - this kind of change require well
defined and stable internal interfaces. So this is really huge amount of work.
	This would be one little step toward the microkernel architecture (like Hurd).
