Just a few comments on this. Compiled on 2.4.17 with gcc-2.95.4. O(1)-J2
only patch applied.
With the thread earlier regarding KDE and image thumbnails and xmms, yes
the machine is now useable whilst the images are being read and rendered,
and xmms doesn't falter, but about 2 seconds after kde finishes, xmms
falters twice (briefly - catches up very quickly).
Also, when X starts up, some of my startup settings seem to load too
quickly - I use uwm and a couple of xterms are started without the
terminal options being set (it seems) - instead of getting "user@host:~/"
on the left, I get each character on a seperate line. Also colours are
not fully set - mutt starts and then it seems the xterm bgcolour gets
applied.
Neither of these have ever happened without the O(1) patch. Please let
me know if I can be of any further assistance.
