Hmm, that's one explanation. The other explanation, which in my view is
the likelier -- but I've been shown wrong before, is that most of those
who went through that code before just didn't have Ingo's insight and
abilities. Which goes to show what can be achieved when "interesting"
ideas are given a hand by those having appropriate insight and
abilities -- and, of course, what fate awaits those other ideas which
are less so fortunate in the eyes of the talented. Praise the lord for
the chosen ones.
