 Hi:
I have a problem using stat() with kernel 2.4.20
The size of ANY fifo is always 0.
There is no backward compatibility.
Probably it is a kernel bug in this particular version.
The problem shows up when using the ls, stat commands.
How reproducible:
Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. mkfifo xx
2. cat > xx &
3. cat < xx
4. ^Z
5. echo "abcd" > xx
Actual Results:  prw-rw-r--    1 kostadin kostadin        0 Feb 21 13:54 xx
Expected Results:  prw-rw-r--    1 kostadin kostadin        5 Feb 21 13:54 xx
In Kernel 2.4.18-X the RedHat work perfect, e inclusive in 2.4.20-X the Redhat
  beta 8.0.94
Helpme please.
