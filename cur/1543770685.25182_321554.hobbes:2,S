If the application captured the mouse/keyboard and did not pass them  
on to
X for some period of time, then X would appear to not respond to VT- 
switch
requests, because those keys go through the same handler loop  
(depending on
the way your X is configured, of course).
I've had incidents where a user forkbomb was able to hang X (and  
therefore
the console) while our SCHED_RR rate-limited SSH daemon was running fine
and able to successfully kill the process.
