Of course, however if you want I can first fix initrd (I was just
looking into it in the last minutes), the security fix broke initrd
badly unfortunately [didn't tested initrd but just the ramdisks before
posting it] (not sure why initrd broke at the moment but I believe the
design of the fix was the right one, so it is probably an implementation
detail). So unless you need it urgently I will try to fix initrd first,
then I will send to you so you can go ahead without risk of future rejects.
thanks!
