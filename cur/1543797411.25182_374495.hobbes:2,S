It's not about being stubborn, it's about maintaining and working on a
clean design. The developers have to do that, not the users. So forgive
people for being a little cautious about shuffling all sorts of ACPI
into the scsi core and/or drivers. We always need to think long term
here.
Users don't care about the maintainability and cleanliness of the code,
they really just want it to work. Which is perfectly understandable.
