What is the problem this fixes?  I don't have any problems with my
C600 suspending and resuming (2.4.19pre7-ac4).  Some of the comments
look BIOS-version-specific... why not just upgrade the BIOS?  (The
comment I saw referred to version A06, but I have A17!)
Correct me if I'm missing something here... I didn't read the patch
too carefully...
