I suggested to Paul that __cpuset_zone_allowed() should check for
__GFP_WAIT and allow the allocation if it is not set. Any allocation
from interrupt context has to be GFP_ATOMIC so that would kill
the need for the in_interrupt() check as well. I'm probably missing
something, but that seemed like the obvious fix to me...
Cheers,
Dave.
