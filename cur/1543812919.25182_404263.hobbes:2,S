Hi Jens,
I was looking over Kai's scsi command size email and was going to try
and add it to some block docs and noticed I did not send the update to
the max_sectors biodoc.txt. Sorry about that. Here is the patch against
2.6.16-rc5.
The max_sectors has been split into max_hw_sectors and max_sectors for some
time. A patch to have blk_queue_max_sectors enforce this was sent by
me and it broke IDE. This patch updates the documentation.
