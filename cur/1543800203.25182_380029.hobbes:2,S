Maybe true, but as I said, if you have preemption enabled, then there
are far more preempt_xxx operations in other places than semaphores,
which impact both size and speed.

I was going from your numbers where you said it was IIRC a cycle faster.

And yet there is a need for architecture specific code. Also having
xchg and a cmpxchg variants mean that you have two different sets of
possible interleavings of instructions, and xchg has much more subtle
cases as you demonstrated.

I don't think size is a great argument, because the operations should
be out of line anyway to save icache (your numbers showed a pretty
large increase when they're inlined)
And as for speed, I'm not arguing that you can't save a couple of
cycles, but I'm weighing that against the maintainability of a generic
implementation which has definite advantages. Wheras I don't think you
could demonstrate any real speed improvement for saving a few cycles
from slightly faster semaphore operations on CONFIG_PREEMPT kernels?
If someone ever did find the need for an arch specific variant that
really offers advantages, then there is nothing to stop tha being
added.
