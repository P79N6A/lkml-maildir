Sorry, I don't know, but see below for possible solution to your problem anyway.

You might want to familiarize yourself with the following kernel parameter:
"ip=<client-ip>:<server-ip>:<gw-ip>:<netmask>:<hostname>:<device>:<autoconf>"
where most options are obvious, and you'll probably want device to be
"eth0" and autoconf to be "dhcp".
HTH,
