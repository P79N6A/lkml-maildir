I found it sufficient to apply
http://people.redhat.com/mingo/raid-patches/raid-2.2.16-A0
to the stock 2.2.16 kernel. Works fine with rh6.2 raid tools. 
Hope it helps,

   So, I have the following questions.
   1)  Do I need to apply the RAID patch to 2.2.16 or not?
   2)  If I do, will it still broken unless I apply the "2.2.16combo" patch?
   3)  If it will, then how do I resolve the problem with the md.c hunk failing 
       with "2.2.16combo"?
   4)  Is there someone I can contact who can update publically available 
       documentation to make it easier for people to find what they're looking 
       for?
   This is a production system I am working on here.  I can't afford to have it
   down for an hour or two to test a new kernel.  I'd rather not be working with
   this mess to begin with, but unfortunately this box was purchased before I
   started this job, and whoever ordered it decided that software raid was
   "Good enough".
   I am not subscribed to either list so CC's are desirable.  However if you
   don't want to CC then you don't have to -- I'll just read the archives.
   That is, if someone fixes the "Mailing list archives" link on www.linux.org 
   to point to someplace that exists and actually has archives.
   Thanks for your time,
   --Adam
