Sorry about all the noise, but I just remembered some other important
aspects that played a role here.
Intel couldn't really ask for the inclusion of iswraid into the tree
much earlier than October because iswraid depends on either ata_piix
or ahci, both part of libata. Libata was included in 2.4.27, ata_piix
in 2.4.28, ahci in 2.4.29.
So I first asked for iswraid to be considered during 2.4.28-pre3 stage.
I was told that it's almost being released and that I should wait
for 2.4.29. There was also a discussion about whether it even belongs
or whether dm belongs more. With 2.4.29 I forgot to remind everybody
to look at iswraid and when I did it was too late for 2.4.29 and
Marcelo asked Jeff to review it for 2.4.30-pre1. (And thanks for
your support, Jeff.)
In short, I only first asked for it to be included with 2.4.28, but
I could not have done it earlier than that anyway because drivers it 
depends on weren't yet in 2.4.
