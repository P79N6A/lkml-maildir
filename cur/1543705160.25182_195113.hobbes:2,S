Subject: Problems with IDE CF - SMP (PREEMPT)

Note that since ide-cs has problems with SMP it will have problems with 
PREEMPT as well...
A now old report...

I have seen problems like this recently (2.4.21) and thought I have read this
somewhere more recent - but can not find it. I will create a bug report.
(Summary: Freezes with SMP, same kernel works with option nosmp)
Remember that drivers that are not SMP safe won't be PREEMPT safe either.
Anyway there are interrupt related PCMCIA problems...
