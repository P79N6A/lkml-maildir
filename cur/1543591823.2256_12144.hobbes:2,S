Well, certainly, this could perhaps be a bug in the Acenic driver.
It should check if DAC cycles can be used on the platform, for example.
But please, let's get back to the original problem though.
The original claim is that the situation was not handled at all.  All
I'm trying to say is simply that the net stack does check via
illegal_highdma() the condition you stated was not being checked at
all.  To me it sounded like you were claiming that HIGHMEM pages went
totally unchecked through device transmit, and that is totally untrue.
If you were trying to point out the problem with what the Acenic
driver is doind, just state that next time ok? :-)
There is no question that what Acenic is doing with ifdefs needs a
clean portable solution.  This will be part of the 64-bit DAC API
interfaces (whenever those become really necessary, I simply don't
see the need right now).
Plainly, I'm going to be highly reluctant to make changes to the PCI
dma API in 2.4.x  It is already hard enough to get all the PCI drivers
in line and using it.  Suggesting this kind of change is similar to
saying "let's change the arguments to request_irq()".  We would do it
to fix a true "people actually hit this" kind of bug, of course.  Yet
we would avoid it at all possible costs due to the disruption this
would cause.
I'm not trying to be a big bad guy about this.  What I'm trying to do
is make sure at least one person (me :-) is thinking about the
ramifications any such change has on all current drivers which use
these interfaces already.  And also, to port maintainers...
Later,
