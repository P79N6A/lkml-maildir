Martin's patch set included the per-IRQ stacks, so that part should be ok. 
However, since even a single function will overflow the stack depth test 
of "half the stack", I'm just saying that right now the 4kB stacks 
obviously shouldn't be used for overflow testing (and the 8kB stack 
version right now is way too permissive).

Well, ide_unregister() was only the worst of a fairly large bunch of crap. 
Although I guess nobody is really surprised.
