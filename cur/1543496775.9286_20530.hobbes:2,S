Wouldn't it be a good idea at this point to switch to a more flexible
format for the quota file? You are correct with the above remarks as
long as userids stay 2 bytes long. For 4 byte userids we are above the
limit for the current maximum file size of ext2 with respect to the
quota file. What about using a hash table instead?
