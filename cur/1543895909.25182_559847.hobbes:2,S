Even if you're correct, that only takes into account the manufacturers
who are using Linux _now_ who might be pressured to allowed modified
versions to run. What about the lost opportunity cost of all of the
future manufacturers who decide to use ProprietaryOS + locks instead
of Linux? We don't get any of their code.
But all of this is moot anyway. You are not going to win the argument
on practical grounds anyway since Linus, Greg, Ingo and several other
developers with collectively many lines of code in the kernel have
stated in one form or another that they don't agree with the ethical
goals of GPLv3. I don't understand who you think you're going to
convince w/ continued debate?
