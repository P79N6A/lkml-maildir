K - so what? I'm guessing what you want me to see is that these
implement multiple channels. Is there a reason that eia001stat couldn't be
implemented as
 f=open("/dev/eia001ctl",O_RDWR);
 write(f,"stat\n");
 status=read(f); /* returns "stat foo\n" */
We don't want to implement a separate device node for every OOB ioctl that
returns data, do we? Why should stat be any different?
/dev/draw is interesting but largely irrelevant. And again, colormap and
refresh - why are they not part of ctl? You've got to select on refresh
anyway, might as well accept asynchronous messages through ctl.
