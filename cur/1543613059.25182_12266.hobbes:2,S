At the moment, however, they do.
The user-visible APIs for ACLs and EAs are quite separate.  However,
the way that the user ACL libraries talk to the filesystem is through
special reserved EAs, to which the kernel magically imparts ACL
semantics.  The format of that EA, its name, its semantics and so on,
are all completely glossed over by the existing EA spec, despite the
fact that this mechanism is right at the very core of the ACL
implementation.

I know, and that's part of the problem we identified over a year ago.
My old EA proposal had the concept of "attribute families", and
allowed us to define ACL attributes in a completely different
namespace from EAs, so that NTFS, AFS or NFSv4 ACLs could be passed
cleanly through the same API.

I'm not mixing them: I'm *trying* to unmix them.
The existing EA code implements magic "handlers" for system EAs.
Undefined magic gets called when you set such an EA.  There's no
mention about this in the spec.
So right now the EA code opens up what is basically a named-ioctl back
door into the filesystems, and ACLs work on top of that.  The existing
ACL and EA code is already enormously intertwined.

Yes, and the existing bestbits ACL API does not have anything like
that abstraction: rather, it relies on doing an assignment to a "$acl"
EA.
So how are we going to do ACLs on top of EAs?  Even if we forget about
the ACL API for now, the API between the ACL layer and the EA layer
*does* matter.  
Cheers,
