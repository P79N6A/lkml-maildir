It is worth noting that on the Gentoo bug report, the user could not 
boot from VIA SATA while that ID was not in the list. However, if the 
ACPI was *disabled* then the system booted fine (even without the SATA 
ID in the list, i.e. no quirk applied).
This suggests that the quirk is only needed for ACPI users, at least on 
that system.
