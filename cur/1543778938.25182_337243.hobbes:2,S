Yep. That comes up fairly regularly when tuning the scheduler :(

Well, that remains to be seen. If it can be made _smarter_, then you
may not have to take such a big compromise.
But either way, there will have to be some compromise made. At the
very least you have to find some acceptable default.

Well, you can easily see suboptimal scheduling decisions on many
programs with lots of interprocess communication. For example, tbench
on a dual Xeon:
processes    1               2               3              4
2.6.13-rc4:  187, 183, 179   260, 259, 256   340, 320, 349  504, 496, 500
no wake-bal: 180, 180, 177   254, 254, 253   268, 270, 348  345, 290, 500
Numbers are MB/s, higher is better.
Networking or other IO workloads where processes are tightly coupled
to a specific adapter / interrupt source can also see pretty good
gains.
