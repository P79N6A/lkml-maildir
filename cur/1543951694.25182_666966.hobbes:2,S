I'm not at all sure there is an oops - in fact, I'd have expected it to 
show up on the serial console if there was one.
The bug report says that the keyboard leds blink, which is *sometimes* due 
to having the led oops blinking code enabled, but hey, no actual oops was 
ever shown, and sometimes a blink is just a blink.
Did you see the full dmesg from syslog? That one has not just the 
warnings, but also sysrq output at the point it hangs. The suspicious 
thing seems to be

which makes me suspect we're in some endless loop in device_shutdown(), 
but that's just a random guess (it seems to be running on the othe CPU: 
CPU0 is in idle - and when that happens the stack trace is really not 
very reliable at all, so take all that with a huge pinch of salt!).

If it had been just the warning, I would ignore it as a good thing to be 
cleaned up later. But no, the original problem was the inability to halt 
and reboot, and the bugzilla entry says
	It also introduces these two errors:

with underlining by me. So the warnings in themselves are just an 
interesting coincidence (and probably related to the cause, of course).
