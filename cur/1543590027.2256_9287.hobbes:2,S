For that matter, ext2 doesn't use the link count on directories to determine
if they are empty either, so it shouldn't be too hard to do the same with
the ext2 indexed-directory code.  Is there a reason that reiserfs chose to
have "large number of directories" represented by "1" and not "LINK_MAX+1"?
