Inode free space can have at most 2^31 extents --- if inode numbers 
alternate between "allocated", "free". How do you pack it to superblock?

So you are going to hit the same problem as I did with SpadFS --- you 
can't export 64-bit inode number to userspace (programs without 
-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 will have stat() randomly failing with EOVERFLOW 
then) and if you export only 32-bit number, it will eventually wrap-around 
and colliding st_ino will cause data corruption with many userspace 
programs.
