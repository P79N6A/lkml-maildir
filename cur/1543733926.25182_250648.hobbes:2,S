Mea culpa. I copied the routines wholesale from 2.6.7 when I started
work on nproc. They still seemed to work with 2.6.9-rc1-bk13, I hadn't
noticed the work that had gone into field computation already. So for
CONFIG_MMU, values in both __task_mem and __task_mem_cheap are cheap
now. The routines can be merged.
!CONFIG_MMU is a different story. Presumably, it needs a change in the
fields that are offered (cp. task_mem in fs/proc/task_nommu.c).
FWIW, my prefered solution would be to have only one routine task_mem
to fill the respective struct for nproc and /proc.
There seems to be a discrepancy between current task_mem in
fs/proc/task_nommu.c and the __task_mem{,_cheap} routines you wrote
for the nproc !CONFIG_MMU case. Can you explain?
