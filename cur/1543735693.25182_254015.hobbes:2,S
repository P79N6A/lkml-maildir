You just filter ICMP packets, in the way RST packets are already
filtered (i.e. rate limit).
The only TCP desynchronization attack that has a chance of working
practice is the SYN-based one.  The rate limit for RST processing on
Cisco routers is far too low.
(Mixed Cisco/Quagga environments are a different matter, but rather
unusual and easily DoSed anyway, most of the time.)
