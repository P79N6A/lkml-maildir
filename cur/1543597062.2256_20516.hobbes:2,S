Hear, hear!  That would be a useful feature, maybe not network servers, 
but for pure number crunching apps it would save people having to write 
all the state saving and recovery that is needed now for long term 
computations.
For bonus points, make it work for clusters to synchronously save and
restore state for the apps running on all the nodes at once...
