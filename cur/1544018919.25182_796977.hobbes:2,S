Hi Frédéric,
Unfortunately, this can't be done for hung_task. It writes to the
task_struct here:
static void check_hung_task(struct task_struct *t, unsigned long now,
                            unsigned long timeout)
{
        unsigned long switch_count = t->nvcsw + t->nivcsw;
        if (t->flags & PF_FROZEN)
                return;
        if (switch_count != t->last_switch_count || !t->last_switch_timestamp) {
                t->last_switch_count = switch_count;
                t->last_switch_timestamp = now;
                return;
        }
It is able to get away with using only a read_lock because no one else
reads or writes to these fields.
Regards,
Mandeep
