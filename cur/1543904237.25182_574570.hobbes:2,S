Maybe a new list should be added to put newly read pages in it. If they
are not used or used once after a certain period, they can be moved to
the inactive list (or whatever).
Newly read pages...
- ... not used after this period are excessive readahead, we discard
immediately.
- ... used only once after this period, we discard soon.
- ... used many/frequently are moved to active list.
Surely the scan rate (do I make sense?) should be different for this
newly-read list and the inactive list. 
I also remember your split mapped/unmapped active list patches from a
while ago.
Can someone point me to a up-to-date documentation about the Linux VM?
The books and documents I've seen are outdated.

I'm more than willing!  Now that CFS is merged, redirect your energies
from nicksched to nick-vm ;)
Patches against any tree (stable, linus, mm, rt) are good. But I prefer
the last stable release because it narrows down the possible problems
that a moving target like the development tree may have.
I test this on my main system, so patches with basic testing and
reasonable stability are preferred. I just want to avoid data corruption
bugs. FYI, I used to run the -rt tree most of the time.

Sure, but there are many hints to detect this: *large* (> most of the
RAM), *streaming*, *used once*
But if a program mmap() a 3/4 of the RAM area and "play" in it, it's a
good sign that the streaming code shouldn't be active.
