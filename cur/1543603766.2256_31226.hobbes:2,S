	Umm...  So you've just given to each fs driver a syscall with
completely unspecified arguments?  I _really_ doubt that it's a good
idea, especially since each instance will have to copy structures
to/from userland.
	Please, put switch by the first argument and copy_{to,from}_user()
into the syscall itself.  Yes, it means more methods, but it helps to avoid
large PITA couple of years down the road.
