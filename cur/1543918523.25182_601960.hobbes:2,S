Because balance_dirty_pages() maintains:
 nr_dirty + nr_unstable + nr_writeback < 
	total_dirty + nr_cpus * ratelimit_pages
throttle_vm_writeout() _should_ not deadlock on that, unless you're
caught in the error term: nr_cpus * ratelimit_pages. 
Which can only happen when it is larger than 10% of dirty_thresh.
Which is even more unlikely since it doesn't account nr_dirty (as I
think it should).
As for 2), yes I think having a limit on the total number of pages in
flight is a good thing. But that said, there might be better ways to do
that.
