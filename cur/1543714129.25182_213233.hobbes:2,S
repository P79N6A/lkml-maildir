Yup. Attatched.

Good idea. Not sure how easy it'll be to back prio_tree out, but I can 
surely do aa5, which would give us a good clue still. Might not be until 
this time tommorow though.

I think there's just a locking cliff you fall off after a certain level
of contention ... i_shared_sem has always been bad for SDET, to be fair.
But I hate making it worse ;-) I did more investigation of it a year or
so ago ... something does horrible things to it (which is why akpm turned
it into a sem in the first place) ... maybe holding it over proess teardown
for eons or something. Bah, I want lockmeter for sems ;-) 
Maybe I can dig out my old analysis ... I'll take a look. I suppose I could
always turn it back into a spinlock to look at it ;-) On the other hand, if
we can fix that problem, I think my "list of lists" was simpler than prio
tree (and is probably much more susceptible to RCU).
