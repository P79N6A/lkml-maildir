I know one point for which it's not good to leave the timer irq "slow" on
32bit machines. All linux timeout (starting from select, nanosleep, poll,
add_timer()) can be at most (~0UL>>1)-1 jiffies. If you increase the jiffy
speed the final result is that you'll be able to handle a very little
maximal timeout everywhere (if I remeber well going from 100 to 1000 you
goes from month to days).
