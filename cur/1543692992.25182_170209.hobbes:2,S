Subject: 2.6.0-test6 module autoloading and reference counting broken?

FYI,
I'm seeing incorrect reference counting behaviour and module
loading semi-failures in 2.6.0-test6.
I have a misc char driver module which announces an alias
via a MODULE_ALIAS("char-major-10-<nnn>") declaration.
The first attempt by user-space to open the device node fails
with ENODEV. However, afterwards the module _is_ loaded and its
use count is 1 even though the user-space open() failed.
Subsequent open()s succeed, but since the reference count is
one too high, I can't unload the module.
If I instead manually insmod or modprobe the module before the
first device node open(), the module's use count is correct and
I can unload it after the last open()ed file goes away.
CONFIG_KMOD is set, module-init-tools is 0.9.14.
I'll keep digging...
