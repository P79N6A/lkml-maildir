> i wrote a module for 2.4. For 2.5 (51,52,53) it compiles nicely, but insmod complains about invalid format. I have the latest module init tools of Rusty installed.  I'm usin gcc 3.2. Do i have to use any special compiler/linker options or defines or whatever to generate a working module ? what could be the problem ? Even a simple hello-world module doesnt work. Although, i have a working 2.5.53 modular kernel that was built using same tools.

Well, you can do
cd my_module
echo "obj-m := my_module.o" > Makefile
vi my_module.c
make -C <path/to/kernel/src> SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
That's not too bad (and basically works for 2.4 as well)
