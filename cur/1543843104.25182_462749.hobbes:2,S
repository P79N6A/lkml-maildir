The point is, that even when I do not quirk (just insert return at the
top of the quirk-function), usb still uses irq 11 (as I wrote here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/6/49
 ), but won't work. And acpi (on
interrupt 9) gets an interrupt storm, and gets disabled.
But if I somehow got usb using irq 9, all my problems might vanish...
