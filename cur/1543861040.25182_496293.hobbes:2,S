It'd be nice if people bothered to cc authors on bug reports, eh?
It seems to me that you're building scsi as modules.  In which case
you need to follow the instructions in the help text to load the
scsi_wait_scan module.  Or just say 'n' to the CONFIG_SCSI_SCAN_ASYNC
option, of course.
You're right that the quotes need to disappear from the Kconfig help
text as they're just confusing.
