The idea of  dmesg  buffer comes to Linux from SunOS 4.x series
on hardware, where system boot code explicitely left aside memory
space which was not _cleared_ during boot (it was parity-regenerated,
though).  The command to display that ring-buffer content was (no
surprise there?) "dmesg".
I do wish so many things from PC hardware, but it has stayed so b***y
inferior to real computers forever.  Lattest AMD CPUs have nice
features making them almost as good as IBM S/370 from early 1970es,
but still BIOSes are rather primitive things keeping things back.
( IOMMUs are things that have been invented since, and are definitely
a good thing.  Otherwise it has been faster and more capacitious
processing and memory at cheaper system cost... )
Like others have noted, display card memory spaces have been used
for this kind of "survives over reset" uses  -- I do also know some
embedded boot codes that created similar ring buffers for similar
reasons.  They don't generally survive over power-cycling, of course.
