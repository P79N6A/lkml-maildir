Ok, please try something for me. In drivers/block/elevator.c, comment
out this block:
	if (q->last_merge) {
		__rq = list_entry_rq(q->last_merge);
		BUG_ON(__rq->flags & REQ_STARTED);
		if ((ret = elv_try_merge(__rq, bio))) {
			*req = __rq;
			return ret;
		}
	}
(just #if 0 the entire thing) -- the one inside elevator_linus_merge()
Loop back highmem issue is different, I'll take a look at that later.
I'll be pretty unresponsive over christmas, though.
