Having the kernel know how to manipulate MTRR's is useful for things
like high performance I/O cards.  Video is just one.  However you definentily
need MTRR's setting it is o.k. to do write back caching on your memory.

I haven't looked.  The fact that they are close probably means it is simple
to convert the code if the code doesn't support your chip.
