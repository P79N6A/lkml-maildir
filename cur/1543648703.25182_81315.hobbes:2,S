Hmmm. Yes, that is a good point. Especially since due to TSC sync
issues, everyone probably won't want to convert to this right off.
Probing might do it, but that would require some fancy trapping in
glibc. Maby users could manually LDPRELOAD a library that would alias
gettimeofday, rather then changing glibc? That way the user of, as you
said specialized db apps,etc, who *really* wants this can get it, but
doesn't affect others.

It seems you been calling the psychic hotline recently! Actually that's
*exactly* what my plans were for the NUMA case. Very good call!
You bring up some good points. I'll try to think about it some more and
see if there isn't a better way. 
thanks
