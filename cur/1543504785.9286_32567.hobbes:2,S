I have a question about pre-patch-2.3.13-4: someone changed the target
"drivers/char/char.a" to "drivers/char/char.o".  Why?
I don't mean to imply this is a bad thing.  In fact I think it's a good
thing.  My Dancing Makefiles use all .o files, no .a files, and I like
the results.  But I'm curious what the reasons are for this change,
it feels like something that I'm going to need to understand someday.
