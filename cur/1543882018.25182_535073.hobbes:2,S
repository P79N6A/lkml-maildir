Yes, I purely use miscdev for the ioctls.
I want to use sysfs and ioctl to implement the dynamic configurabillity.
The sysfs shows/changes netconsole configurations(IP address, port and so on).
A userland application using the ioctl adds/removes netconsole port.
I thought that the dynamic configurability could be realized without a 
userland application. in the kernel only.
(e.g. only sysfs, no userland application)
But I think we need the function to automatically resolve the destination 
MAC address from IP address because of the resolving cost and 
I should implement a userland application, not netconsole kernel module.
The netconsle will become more useful by implementing the above function.

If I use sysfs, Is it proper location that adds each attributes of netconsole 
port in "/sys/class/misc/netconsole/port[0-9]*", or another locations in /sys/?
Stephen Hemminger said "The configuration of netconsole's looks like the 
configuration of routes".
I think so too.
So I think ioctl commands for adding/removing port and the following userland 
application like route(8) command by using the ioctl.
e.g.
1. add port
# netconfig add 192.168.0.10 6666
2. remove port
# netconfig remove 1
3. show port info
# netconfig
id status  Source IP   Source Port Destination IP Destination Port Destination MAC
1  enable  192.168.0.1 6665        192.168.0.10   6666             00:11:22:33:44:55
2  disable 192.168.0.1 6665        192.168.0.20   6666             00:11:22:33:44:66
route(8) command uses ioctl for Netlink.
But, I'm going to implement ioctl's to /dev/console because of the above comments.
Thank you for your comments.
Any comments very welcome.
