Prefer the patch split into "comments", "inconsistent kallsyms data fix"
and "speedup".  I also prefer using a whole letter over a single bit:
this allows archs which have wierd nm letters to express them, and
instead of case indicating what symbols are exported, we get the real
correct results.
Thanks,
Rusty.
