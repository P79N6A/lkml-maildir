For those who asked a few days ago about cryptography in France, I have a short answer :
It used to be completely forbidden in the past, but recent laws now allow anybody to use cryptography up to 128-bits, with no authorisation. So, there is no restriction any more for France if any cryptographic module is included in the Linux kernel.
