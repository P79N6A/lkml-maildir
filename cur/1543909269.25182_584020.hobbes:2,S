That page says there's a whole whopping 587 people reporting back, of which
1 is on 23-rc1-mm1, and 3 are on 23-rc2-mm2.
I know I'm on 23-rc2-mm1 at the moment (backed off from 23-rc2-mm2 due to
the sysctl breakage in iptables).  I certainly *hope* there's more than
5 people trying the -mm kernels, and I'm guessing that in fact, most -mm users
are *not* running klive.
