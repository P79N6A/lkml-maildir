Hi all!
I have a problem with 2.4.0
I'm testing Informix IIF-2000 database server running on dual Intel
Pentium II - 233. When I run 'make -j30 bzImage' in the kernel source,
my
Linux box hangs without any messages. This occurs when Informix is
running. When I stoped Informix and tryed to do the same, all passed ok!
I think this is bug in kernel ( VM subsystem ) code.
Informix allocate about to 50% of memory as LOCKED shared memory
segments. 
I'm thinking the reason in this. Kernel wants, but can't to swap out
locked shm's segments.
Thank you.
