I am wondering who maintains drivers/ide/sl82c105.c, and who sent in
the recent changes to it.  We now have, at around line 278, this code:
unsigned int pci_init_sl82c105(struct pci_dev *dev, const char *msg)
{
        return ide_special_settings(dev, msg);
}
The call to ide_special_settings gives a link error because
ide_special_settings is not exported from drivers/ide/ide-pci.c.
I can't see what the point of calling it is anyway, even if it were
exported, since ide_special_settings consists of a switch statement on
the device ID and none of the cases will match.
Paul (who uses sl82c105.c on his longtrail PPC CHRP box).
