At least as of 2.5.68 floppy corrupts data, and there have been odd (but
not horrifying) problems with IDE that Bart may now have fixed. After
that its a case of going through the noise, figuring out which other
minor corruption reports come from the tty bug, vm races, user error,
bad ram and so on.
I run 2.5.x continually on some non critical boxes. I do have backups 
but even on 2.4 nothing says my disk wont suddenely fail anyway.
A lot of these are corner cases, and crossing off items one at a time,
not "it eats lots of computers"
