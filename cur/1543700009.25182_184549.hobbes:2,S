No.  The administrator can limit many of these.  I want the software to
be able to limit itself.

If you give administrators tools to limit privileges, some well-educated
admins may do it, but the bulk will not.
If you give software authors the tools to drop privileges they don't
need, and you help everyone.

Not an option for a web server or smtpd.

That will still allow the process to ptrace other processes of the same
uid.

Again, not an option.
I hope I made myself more clear this time.
I would be happy with a well documented and fine grained capabilities
system, and maybe a new syscall:
  abstain(__NR_execve);
I would also like a way to say that I want to never access the network
except through sockets that are already open (and presumably passed to
me at process creation).  Dan Bernstein has a good rationale on what I
think is needed: 
http://cr.yp.to/unix/disablenetwork.html,
 however I
think if we do this, we might as well opt for more flexibility.
Imagine being able to call "gzip -dc" in a pipe and denying it write
access to the file system, network I/O and other harmful operations.
If programs can restrict themselves, we could write email client
software that uses external untrusted plugins without fear of buffer
overflows or catching yourself a root kit.
