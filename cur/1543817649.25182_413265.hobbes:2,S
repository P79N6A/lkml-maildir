Subject: [2.6.16.1 BUG?] EXT3 error on encrypted volume on top of RAID5
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I set up a new file server with 4*250GB SATA disks, on top of that I run
RAID5 (and RAID1 for the boot partition).
There is a RAID5 volume of 332GB, on top of that I created an encrypted
volume with cryptsetup like this:
cryptsetup create vol1s /dev/md4 -h sha256 -y
On the encrypted volume I have a standard EXT3 file system. Everything
seems okay. I then copied a lot of files from Windows with Samba, and
suddenly this error occurred about halfway through copying a large file
(about 8GB):
Apr  3 01:28:54 localhost kernel: EXT3-fs error (device dm-0): ext3_readdir: bad entry in directory #6275075: rec_len %% 4 != 0 - offset=0, inode=1896112483, rec_len=55802, name_len=122
Apr  3 01:28:55 localhost kernel: Aborting journal on device dm-0.

Then in the morning I unmounted the file system and ran fsck on it. There wasn't any errors found, but I got this in the syslog:
Apr  3 08:20:46 localhost kernel: __journal_remove_journal_head: freeing b_committed_data
Apr  3 08:20:46 localhost kernel: __journal_remove_journal_head: freeing b_frozen_data
Apr  3 08:20:46 localhost last message repeated 2 times
After running fsck, I mounted it back online and copied the big file again, this time there was no error and no messages in the syslog.
