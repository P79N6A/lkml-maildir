Yes.  It is a bug, and the description reparent_to_init is likewise
buggy.
I have recently realized that a number of the inital pid namespace
patches have stupid little bugs in them like this.  I am upset with
myself for failing to code review them closely before the went in.
Live and learn I guess.
So when I saw this I added this to my growing list of things I needed
to review before I could assume they were done correctly.
Feel free to fix it.  I'm still a couple days out from having enough
time before I can start working on pid related issues.
Eric
