Just to add another data-point to this, I also have one of these drives
sitting on an NCR-based controller. 
sym53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 11, function 0
sym53c8xx: setting PCI_COMMAND_PARITY...(fix-up)
sym53c8xx: 53c875 detected with Tekram NVRAM
sym53c8xx: at PCI bus 0, device 10, function 0
sym53c8xx: setting PCI_COMMAND_PARITY...(fix-up)
sym53c8xx: 53c860 detected with Symbios NVRAM       
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00

The disk is the only device on the 875 controller; I have a tape drive
and Zip disk on the 860.
I have no problems with this setup. Have been running all of the 
2.2.x kernels without any problem at all. I regularly perform
backups from the SCSI disk to the SCSI tape.
The SCSI disk only has Linux partitions, though. I have a separate
(IDE) disk for the rare occasion that I have to run Windows.
