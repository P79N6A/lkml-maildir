Using "__get_free_pages" don't help. The real problem is the page after
the allocated page. Not the page where fs_names starts.
Have just printk some adresses from fs_names. They are c1152000,
c1150000, c2736000, c0450000, and so. All this adresses are not in
vmalloc. See boot messages. Was booting with mem=40:
  virtual kernel memory layout:
    fixmap  : 0xffffc000 - 0xfffff000   (  12 kB)
    vmalloc : 0xc3000000 - 0xffffa000   ( 975 MB)
    lowmem  : 0xc0000000 - 0xc2800000   (  40 MB)
In mount_block_root the loop
   for (p = fs_names; *p; p += strlen(p)+1) {
can point behind the allocated page. What is, if the function
exact_copy_from_user access to "p+PAGE_SIZE" where p=fs_names+9 and this
page is not mapped?
The problem I see, is, that sys_mount is designed for userland calls.
But mount_block_root give kernel space as parameter (address >=
c000000). In mount_block_root (fs/namespace.c) the size will roll over,
and is limited to PAGE_SIZE. For example TASK_SIZE=c0000000,
data=c1152000...c2736000:
   size = TASK_SIZE - (unsigned long)data;
   if (size > PAGE_SIZE)
           size = PAGE_SIZE;
   i = size - exact_copy_from_user((void *)page, data, size);
There, "exact_copy_from_user" is all times called with 4096 as size, if
comes from mount_block_root. That's why I would give only page aligned
parameters from mount_block_root to sys_mount.
Sorry, that I operate with hexnumbers. Memory mapping is not my favorite
source code, and with the numbers it is more clear to see here.
