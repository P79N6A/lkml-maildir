This sounds rather arbitrary.  Is there a rule to follow here?
How do you spin lock briefly?  You mean break it on a timer?
And do you mean to literally call sched_yield several times in a row?
It's too bad I don't have any books covering this kind of thing,
because it would be nice to have when playing with threads.  Most
books have a ``trust the kernel functions'' POV.

You can use IPC like this on systems without locks or rendesvous
functions to get the same effect.  Not perfect, but if it's all
you have...
