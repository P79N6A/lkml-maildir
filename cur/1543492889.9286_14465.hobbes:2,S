1. I hope you use fcntl() or lockf() [the same thing] to lock the file,
   not flock().  flock() does local locking only.
2. You do *unlock* the file afterwards, don't you?

In Linux 2.2, NFS locking with fcntl() or lockf() acts as a cache
coherency point.  [This was added in 2.1.131].
You must not use the `nolock' option to mount.
So provided both clients lock the file around their access, there should
be no delay.

If the locking is incorrect, it won't work.  You'll lose counts.
Mail is easily lost for similar reasons.
If the locking is correct, it should work barring bugs.
[There is a rare race bug in NFS lock cache flushing whose fix I must
remember to send in]
