Hi.
I purchased an AMD64 laptop last December, and have never had perfect success 
in getting suspend to disk to work reliably. I thought maybe I had a bug in 
Suspend2, but careful diagnosis kept pointing in the direction of drivers. In 
addition, from time to time, the screen goes plain white and the system stops 
responding, requiring a hard power off.
The other day, I saw a report of bios settings for the uma aperature not 
matching what Linux was detecting. I checked my machine, and found that this 
issue is occuring here. If I set the bios to 32 meg, lspci says it's 64, and 
so on. If I set the bios to 256 meg, the system is unbootable. (Forgive me if 
my terminology is a bit messed up - I'm not a pci expert!).
I've seen a number of other reports of issues with pci region sizes, not 
always graphics related.

I'm therefore wondering, could there be some bug in the sizing of regions 
that's leading to the sizes being doubled?
I have also emailed my laptop manufacturer to see if there are any bios 
updates available.
Regards,
Nigel
