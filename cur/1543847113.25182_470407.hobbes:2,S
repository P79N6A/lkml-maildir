Sure. But it's not a _cleanup_ as far as I can tell.

I'm not saying that what you describe is impossible. I'm just saying that 
it's pointless. 
What's wrong with passing in "irq"? It makes sense from a logical angle, 
and it's something you kind of expect if you think of irq's as "signals 
for the kernel" (which they almost literally used to be, why do you think 
it was called "SA_SHIRQ" etc?).
So there is absolutely nothing wrong with passing in irq from a conceptual 
or a practical angle, and some routines _do_ use it.
