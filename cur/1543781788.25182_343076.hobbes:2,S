I don't see the point. X works fine as is without renicing not withstanding 
these extreme loads in interbench. Furthermore, reworking of xorg code to not 
spin the cpu unnecessarily when the gpu is busy is underway and tuning the 
cpu scheduler unfairly for an X server that will no longer behave so badly is 
inappropriate.
