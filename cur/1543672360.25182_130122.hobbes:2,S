I was talking about an method that does not require a registration
point.  So it sounds like we are talking past each other on this one.

There are 2 possible interfaces to get a vaddr to phys addr mapping.
1) Register the memory area and pin it down.
2) MMap from memory allocated by the driver.
   In this case the driver is told about every mmap and unmap.
So I believe that baring the strange issues with hooking malloc
to call a mmap function on your driver 2 is the correct solution.

Agreed.  I was simply mention the requires for that to be safe.

That is clearly broken code.  A user space application compiled statically is
one thing.  Directly putting syscalls in libraries other than libc is
quite bad.  And I currently cannot think of an excuse for it.
Especially as that will ensure you use the slow syscall path on recent
kernels.
