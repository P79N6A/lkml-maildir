hm, this one-time cost was never on my radar. [ It's really dwarved by 
other startup costs (a single fork() takes 100 usecs, an exec() takes 
800 usecs.) ]
In any case, we can delay this cost into the first cachemiss, or can 
eliminate it by making it a globally pooled thing. It does not seem like 
a big issue.
