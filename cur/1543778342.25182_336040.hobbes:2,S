When I originally wrote this all up, I had planned it to be used the way
i386 does: offer a full implementation of topology if appropriate, else
include the generic "sane" default.  It has since changed to work more like
you described: implement some (or all) of the topology functions, then
include the generic one to define any you missed.

You are correct in noticing that things should (though apparently don't?)
go wonky when arches define their topology functions as *functions*, rather
than macros.  It hasn't really seemed to bite anyone yet, so I've left it
alone, though to be honest, it is as surprising to me that it works as it
is to you.  I've resisted creating #ifdef ARCH_HAVE_XXX all over the place,
though maybe it is finally time?

It would indeed...  I'd be more than happy to look at any patches you care
to generate.  As I said, it seems to work, though I'm certain it's all held
together by GCC black magic & voodoo, and probably a little duct-tape.  A
more obviously correct solution would not be a bad thing. :)
