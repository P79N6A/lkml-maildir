It was absolutely great that you benchmarked it relative to the Lever-Provos
/dev/poll, since that made it quite clear yours scaled much better than theirs
to large numbers of idle sockets.  
Perhaps somebody who uses the realtime signal - based readiness notifications
can enhance Davide's benchmark to also cover them (with and without Luban's patch)?
That would help those of us who are trying to decide whether to go with
/dev/poll or realtime signals.

Yes, in fact, it shows that adding more dead connections actually
improves performance using your patch :-)
Here's what the little birdie told me exactly:

I think the application was similar to your benchmark configuration;
no idea what the ratio of live to dead connections was.
Let's see: if you have 1/32nd as much RAM as she had, you ought to 
be able to handle 1/32nd as many connections, right?  Since you
hit 16000 connections, I guess you just about did.
