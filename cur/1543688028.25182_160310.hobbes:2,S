add_to_page_cache() can be fairly high-frequency when the pagecache is
created anew (write) and torn down immediately afterwards (temporary
files). So i dont think it's 100% ratelimited by IO speed.
the cleanest thing would be to do the hashtable registration with every
futex existing in the system. But we might get away with doing it only for
FUTEX_FD 'asynchronous' futexes (which are only limited by the # of open
files, per process), and do the usual page pinning (and thus fast) thing
with the 'synchronous' futexes (which are limited to one per context, so
they are resource-limited automatically). As long as the hashtable is
empty, the lookup ought to be really fast.

futexes do have some small lowmem footprint nevertheless (they have a
queue entry structure, etc.), but much less than PAGE_SIZE. So basically
the overhead can be added to the already existing fd footprint, without
changing the balance too much.
but if all futexes pin down one page (worst-case), then to make it really
safe we'll have to use a fairly low default RLIM_NRFUTEX value - which
will decrease the generic utility of futexes.
