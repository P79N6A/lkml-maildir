A module I wrote to encapsulate all the OSS logic into a single file. 
There are so many sound drivers that get their ioctls wrong in certain
cases, don't do mmap, etc. that I moved all the logic into one place.
You can obtain include/linux/oss_audio.h and drivers/sound/oss_audio.c
from gkernel CVS.  Check out module 'linux_2_4', tag
'hack_2_4_0_test11'.  (
