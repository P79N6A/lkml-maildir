I have to admit that I'd overlooked that fact, and that is not a good
idea at all. However, I find it hard to believe that the current
broken behaviour of having otherwise valid names called invalid just
because they happen to coincide with a non-visible name for an
existing file.
Based on your comments, I would tend to think that hard links would
solve the problem for non-directory entries, but they are clearly not
suitable for directory entries. In my book, SymLinks are a non-starter
simply because they have too many pre-requisites relating to cross-
device links.
Allowing for this, my suggested solution would be along the lines of
using the mode bits to deal with the problem, based on something along
the lines of the following:
 1. Where a directory or file only has an 8.3 name, use that name as
    currently. No change is needed in this case.
 2. Where a FILE has both an 8.3 name and a LFN, have both appear
    in the relevant directory, set as hard links to each other.
 3. Where a DIRECTORY has both an 8.3 name and a LFN, have both
    appear in the relevant directory, but with the 8.3 name having
    mode 0000 and the immutable bit permanently set.
Can I also ask one question about VFAT which I am not certain about:
Where an entry has both an 8.3 name and a LFN, is the 8.3 name set by
the LFN to be specifically one thing?
The reason I ask this is that my understanding of the way the VFAT fs
works implies that the two names are effectively independant, and the
only requirement attached to them is that they both point to the same
file.
If that is true, then given the file...
 Q> ANTIDI~1.LST => Antidisestablishmentarians.lst
...there would in theory be nothing wrong with doing...
 Q> mv ANTIDI~1.LST LOSERS.LST
...and ending up with...
 Q> LOSERS.LST => Antidisestablishmentarians.lst
...even though the Windows rename command doesn't do that. Likewise,
if one was to then do...
 Q> mv Antidisestablishmentarians.lst unwanted.lst
...then one could validly end up with...
 Q> LOSERS.LST => unwanted.lst
...even though both sides are valid 8.3 names.
There would of course be a requirement that one of the two names must
fit the 8.3 format, and I'm not pretending otherwise.
Best wishes from Riley.
