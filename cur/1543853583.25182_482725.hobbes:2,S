I certainly agree with this.
The driver should either (a) know MSI works for the device [it calls 
pci_msi_enable()] or (b) never bothers with MSI.
Combine that with accurate pci_msi_enable() failure, and life is good.
No 'test if MSI works' crapola in drivers.  I've disliked such tests 
since the day MSI was introduced into Linux.

Agreed.

Yeah, but you don't care if that happens, so this is an ineffective 
'btw'  It's not like you went to sleep crying over the loss, like I did 
[just kidding!]

No, that's most likely because ethernet is always intentionally locked 
to a single CPU by irqbalance.
