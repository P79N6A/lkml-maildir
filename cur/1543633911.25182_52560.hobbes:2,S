Hello,
some more work on the cramfs patch:
+ mkcramfs can detect hard linked files again.  Duplicate files are
  not detected - I don't think that is of much use.
+ support for uncompressed files fixed.  Did not work to reliable
  before.
+ added a flag (-a 0.95) to mkcramfs to automatically XIP files (store
  them uncompressed) if the compression ration is below the specified
  limit.
Here is the patch:

+mtime-2.4.17.patch-2.gz (16k)
This time the URL does really work.
