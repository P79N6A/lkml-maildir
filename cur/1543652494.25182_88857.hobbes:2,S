That's the only reason I can think of.  Simply scrubbing all the state
bits is totally the wrong way of going about that, of course.

The only problem I could think of there would be weird interactions
with LVM if somebody lvextends a volume and the buffer suddenly
becomes valid again.  I can't bring myself to care about breaking that
situation. :-)
