Devil is in details :-) DVD was cracked just since good cryptography was used
wrong way. DVD approarch was flawed by two reasons:
  1. Key is stored in software. No matter how deep it's obscured if it's in
PC memory it CAN BE found - sooner or later. In proposed case key is NEVER
exposed for PC: all is done in HDD itself.
  2. ONE key was used for LOTS AND LOTS of videos. In case of firmware upgrade
you can use different key for each group of drives (100-1000). Since each
TripleDES signature is just 16 bytes you can attach 10000 signatures (and thus
1'000'000-10'000'000) and still add only 160K to firmware upgrade size. Then
even if you'll crack one key you'll still can corrupt only 100-1000 systems
in worst case. And even this is problematic and does not worth trouble if
this 100-1000 drives are in different parties (that is: you are NOT using
first key for first 1000 drives, second one for next 1000 drives and so on;
instead you are using first key for first drive, second key for second drive,
..., 10000 key for 10000 drive and then repeat from the beginning).
Yes, crypto is not silver bullet. Still it's VERY hard to break if used right.

Oh, year. Of course. Still it's not THAT hard to implement properly.

Pubish the whole procedure BEFORE creating hardware to implement it. Wait and
see responces from crypto-analysts. If they all said "it's ok to do" go ahead.

You can not filter them. Not if you have raw I/O access. And if you DO NOT
need raw I/O access then better to disable it completely then to try fitler it.
This stuff is not needed in running system anyway so just configure all your
IDE drives properly and remove raw I/O access from system.
If something is REALLY needed without raw I/O access then provide IOCTLs to do
JUST WHAT IS NEEDED, do not try to filter our raw data.
