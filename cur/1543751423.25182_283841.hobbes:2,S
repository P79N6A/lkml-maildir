No.  I specificly asked the question how they're using it and they're use is
 a) completely buggy
 b) poking so deep in the kernel that the user falls under the GPL
    derived works clause.  As a copyright holder of quite a bit of fs/*.c
    I certainly wouldn't give IBM a special exception to use it even if
    it was exported.
These exports were only added for intermezzo during 2.4.x and with the
removal of intermezzo they go.  They never were a public API, and that they
were needed at all was a managment mistake in how that code was merged.

We've been removing stuff that has
 (1) no intree users
 (2) doesn't make sense as API
there's simply no guarantee with out of tree users.  I've gotten quite a few
mails for the recent removals, and I could tell everyone a better way to
solve it.  Just as we did to IBM for this problem (very highlevel as they
don't show sources), but they insist on their completely broken way of doing
it.
