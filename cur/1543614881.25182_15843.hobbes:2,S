Congratulations, you just invented bugzilla 8)
The only thing I dislike about bugzilla (and lookalikes) is that
someone has to go through them pruning them, updating them etc
and this is a lot of work.
Look at $vendor_of_choice's bugzilla entry for the kernel.
You'll see hundreds, nay, thousands of reports filed.
It's an immense amount of data to track.
Some people have no problem with this, others loath it.
The advantage email has over this are too numerous to list,
but they start with the fact that lots of kernel developers are
lazy[*]. 2-3 keypresses to archive a patch for looking at later/merging
are about the level of involvement thats aimed for.
Having to start a browser, go to the bugzilla site, log in, search/browse
for bugs etc.. way too involved.
Dave.
