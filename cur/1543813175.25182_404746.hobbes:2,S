Let me understand this. Lets say we have sysfs directory tree like 
	/sys/a/b/c
and someone is trying to create one more kobject with name "c" for the
parent kobject "b" ? 
And are you saying that though the new creation fails but the existing
directory remains in sysfs? I think failing the new creation and leaving
the exisiting directoy is ok. But there is sysfs_dirent leakage which 
does need fixing.

If you are talking about the example above, to me it appears that except
a possible sysfs_dirent leakage, we are some what ok, else there would have 
been more catastrophic results because of the duplicate directory dentry/inode.
As per the current code 
static int create_dir(struct kobject * k, struct dentry * p,
                      const char * n, struct dentry ** d)
{
        int error;
        umode_t mode = S_IFDIR| S_IRWXU | S_IRUGO | S_IXUGO;
        mutex_lock(&p->d_inode->i_mutex);
        *d = lookup_one_len(n, p, strlen(n));
^^^^ lookup_one_len() will return the existing dentry corresponding to
     the last component "c" in "/sys/a/b/c" without any error. Just note
     that VFS is not going to allocate a new dentry for it. The existing
     dentry's ref count will be increased by one.
        if (!IS_ERR(*d)) {
                error = sysfs_make_dirent(p->d_fsdata, *d, k, mode, SYSFS_DIR);
^^^^ we do have problem here, a new sysfs_dirent is allocated which
     replaces the existing dentry->d_fsdata and yuk... the old sysfs_dirent
     is no more linked with the existing directory, there by leaking 
     one sysfs_dirent.
Not only for sysfs_create_dir(), I think the problem of existing sysfs_dirent
is also there with sysfs_add_file() and sysfs_add_link(). I am working on a 
patch to plug this leak.
Thanks
