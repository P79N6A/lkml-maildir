The mechanism currently in place is to have gpiochip_remove() fail
if the platform's teardown() logic doesn't reject it.  (It may be
practical to have the teardown code get rid of the users...)  That
would be reflected as an "rmmod" failure.
Are you saying that doesn't work?
I'm not a huge fan of explicit manipulation of module refcounts,
though there can be a place for such things.
Supporting removal of a gpio_chip is my least favorite feature of
this framework.  Especially for controller drivers which could
realistically manage per-GPIO IRQs ... since genirq doesn't seem to
like the notion of irq_chip removal.  (The MCP23s08 and its I2C
sibling the MCP23008 have real IRQ control logic, but the pca953x
and pcf857x chips have a much less functional IRQ mechanism.)

If they call gpiochip_remove(), they should be modified to ensure
they initialize this new "owner" field.  That would be all of the
drivers currently in drivers/gpio (not just pca953x).

By "nullified", I presume you mean to suggest that the "owner" field
be initialized to NULL ... which will normally be the case, when the
gpio_chip is a static data structure or comes from kzalloc().
