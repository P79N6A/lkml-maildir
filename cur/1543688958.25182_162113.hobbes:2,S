I've tried to make each changeset do one conceptual item. And, each patch
that I posted, besides obviously the cumulative one, represents one
changeset.

What is the problem with it? Why is it not better than what was there 
before?

The first is unintentional and not something I see here. Will investigate 
further. 
Have you confirmed that x86-64 is broken, or are you simply trying to 
raise more accusations? If it is broken, please tell exactly what the 
problem is and I will fix it.

That was in software_suspend() itself, which was completely bogus. For 
one, you should review how you're getting called and realize that neither 
places were atomic contexts. So, it was useless. 
Now, you did export software_suspend() for some unknown reason, and that 
is simply bogus. Why would a module call you? 
Finally, you BUG()'d when you could simply return an error. That's 
completely unfriendly to the user. Just return an error, like every other 
sane code path.

panic() is not a valid replacement for sane error handling. Every single 
panic() in swsusp can be replaced by proper error handling. You should 
have done that a long time ago. Calling panic() is just lazy.

They will remain at the URL I posted the other day. As will the patches 
to convert it back to the state you please. I will patch against the 
current tree and continue to work from there. Note that this involves the 
contents of kernel/swsusp.c only. 
And, the driver model is working fine. I don't know what you're 
complaining about now, but a sane bug report would be helpful. So would 
some patches -- you've been maintaining swsusp for two years now, and 
you've not help convert one driver to the new model (even before it 
changed). 
Thanks,
