That is true, but here's the definition of the io_event strcuture:
struct io_event {
        __u64           data;
        __u64           obj;
        __s64           res;
        __s64           res2;
};
In the words of the comment, C may be "fun", but I've
having trouble envisioning an architecture where a structure
that consists of four equal sized objects has some padding!
Don't we usually call code that defends against impossible
problems "bloat"?
