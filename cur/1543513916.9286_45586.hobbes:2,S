Subject: Patch(?): linux-2.3.23/drivers/sound/maestro.c did not compile

	I had to make the following one line change to
linux-2.3.23/drivers/sound/maestro.c.  I think the patch is correct,
but, because I have never been able to get this or any other version
of the maestro driver to play on the notebook computer that I have
access to that has this hardware, I cannot really report that this
works.  So, I am sending this to you, Alan (it's your driver), and
cc'ing linux-kernel in case anybody else wants sees a problem with
the patch.  If it looks OK to you, you can either send it off to
Linus or tell me to, whatever is more convenient for you.
