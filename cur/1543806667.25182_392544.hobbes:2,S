Which is resolved via:
ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.16-rc1/2.6.16-rc1-mm4/broken-out/serial-initialize-spinlock-for-port-failed-to-setup.patch
Since the above fixes the problem, this patch is withdrawn.

Agreed, when serial-initialize-spinlock-for-port-failed-to-setup.patch is
applied, the above spin_lock_init() is no longer required.

Ok, this was perhaps a bad example, some machines call early_serial_setup()
much earlier via setup_arch() or sooner.  This case used an arch_initcall
which is admittedly rather late to be calling early_* funcs.  My bad...

FWIW, I agree but had to use early_serial_setup() for other reasons (kgdb8250
vs. standard 8250 serial port fights in an earlier 2.6 kernel release).  Well,
aside from my brain damaged use of early_serial_setup(), there was a real
bug initialising the serial console spinlock.  So it wasn't a total waste
of time.  : )

FWIW, I also prefer to see early_serial_setup() killed off and force current
users to register 8250 ports via platform devices.  But I'm stuck with
early_serial_setup() in my current case.
Thanks for your comments.
