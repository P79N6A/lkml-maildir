From what I can see, the USB serial drivers included firmware images
before you contributed to that code.  If you contributed changes with
reckless disregard to their presence (i.e. should have known they were
there and you did not say "I contribute this on the condition that the
maintainers work to remove binary firmware"), I believe that you
accepted their presence.
http://www.ipwatchdog.com/equitable_estoppel.html
 discusses equitable
estoppel vis-a-vis patent rights (which are treated similarly to
copyrights by many courts).  When you contributed your changes to the
USB maintainers, they -- and later redistributors -- inferred that you
would not allege copyright infringement by applying your changes to
the kernel that existed then.
The first binary firmware I found in the kernel was included in linux
2.0, released in June 1996.  There might be an earlier case.  You
might argue plausible ignorance of that particular driver, but you as
an individual have a harder claim to demonstrate.  See below.

You managed to contribute some significant creative (copyrightable)
change to the USB serial code without noticing that *a quarter* of the
files in that directory were headers that defined firmware?  I do not
know if a court would take such a claim seriously, but as a software
developer, I do not.

I am aware of several reasons your writings are not legal advice.  As
another non-lawyer, though, I wanted to give you a chance to defend
your claims before I decide they are entirely meritless.
