Im sorry for the subject I just wanted to give the environmental factors, and it is a
non-blocking socket. At this point I am not sure if that is relavent or not.

We simply rerun the same binary in the same environment, first with 2.2.x, and then
with 2.4.x. We have verified that socket(), and connect() calls are successfull, and
all of our problems arise when we go to send().
We do not send() until our main select() loop sets the writeable flag on our socket
descriptor, so our problem should not be related to a pre-mature send().
I dont expect this to be a kernel bug, but I was hopeing from the pseudo-code I posted
to get a "you are doing this wrong" response.
Again, everything is working in 2.2.x, but not in 2.4.x. It may be that our coding error
is only expressed in combination with the 2.4.x kernel, thats why I asked in this
mailing
list.

Oh, something else in our system was doing this then. Thanx for the info.
