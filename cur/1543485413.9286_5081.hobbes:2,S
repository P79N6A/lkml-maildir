What do these tools do? Are you referring to measuring CPU performance
(cache misses, TLB refills and so on) or something else? My MSR patch
includes a thin driver for performance monitoring:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/
and is supported by a userspace library to yield easy access. The idea
is that you can then build glitzy tools on top of the library.
