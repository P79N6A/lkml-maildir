Great. And you're right in that the spec did not give any indication that MMC shouldn't work.
I did notice one thing though. The pull-ups and pull-downs seem to be controllable. If I remember correctly, DAT3 needs to have a controller-side pull-up for MMC cards. And the docs said the default was not to provide that (in order to use the internal pull-up that most, but not all, SD cards have for detection). Might be something to look at if you haven't already.
