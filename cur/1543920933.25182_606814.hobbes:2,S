Subject: kbuild mailing list has moved
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The vger postmasters has created linux-kbuild on my request.
The old list at sourceforge had a few issues:
- it was subscriber-only
- it were relying on moderation
And I could see several mails did not get to the list lately
so I decided this was a good time for a new list.
I already requested marc.info to archieve the new list -
and I dunno where else the old list was archieved but we
ought to update.
I have no access to the list of subscribers on the old list
so people will have to subscribe manually.
How to subscribe:
send a mail to: majordomo@vger.kernel.org
containing following text:
subscribe linux-kbuild

Below is a patch to update MAINTAINERS in the kernel.
Note that I expect the list to cover both pure kbuild
but also kconfig stuff.
