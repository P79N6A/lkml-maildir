Right, good catch.  I'll add another OR to the 'default y' and correct 
the text.

As I mentioned, I will use CONFIG_OPROFILE_CELL in the 
arch/powerpc/oprofile/Makefile as follows:
      oprofile-$(CONFIG_OPROFILE_CELL) += op_model_cell.o \
               cell/spu_profiler.o cell/vma_map.o cell/spu_task_sync.o

Hmmm . . . I guess that would entail splitting out the SPU-related stuff 
from op_model_cell.c into a new file.  Maybe more -- that's just what 
comes to mind right now.  Could be very tricky, and I wonder if it's 
worth the bother.
