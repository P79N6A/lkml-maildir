Although don't try to do this in 1U with 1GHz chips unless you clock
down and reduce the voltage (you need a "fair amount" of free space 
above the heatsink to dissipate the heat). Hmm that reminds me I must 
complete the auto voltage selection code in cpufreq.

I built a "no moving parts" router thingy in 1U that used max 19W.
You get a nice MTBF (5.25 years for our config) when there's nothing
mechanical as well as a good power saving. The main parts were:
PSU: EOS VLT60-3000 (now celetron)
MB:  Advantech PCM9576
CPU: Ezra C3 866a
HD:  64MB compact flash
