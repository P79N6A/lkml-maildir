The amount of memory per socket is controlled by the socket buffering. 
Your application
could be setting the value by calling setsockopt(). Otherwise, the tcp 
memory is limited
by the sysctl settings tcp_rmem (receiver) and tcp_wmem (sender).
For example on this server:
$ cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem
4096    16384   131072
Each sending socket would start with 16K of buffering, but could grow up 
to 128K based
on TCP send autotuning.
