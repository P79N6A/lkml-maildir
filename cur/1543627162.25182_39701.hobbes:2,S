It is not a big deal.  The issue is that in the system shutdown code,
something does not release a lock but just figures "the system is going
down, what is the point?"  It is probably the BKL ...
For the sake of code readability and having nothing quit with a nonzero
preempt_count, we should explicitly drop the lock, but it is not hurting
anything (now, if you get this message elsewhere, there may be a
problem).
I am trying to find what is the cause but I have not tracked it down yet
