On s390, nothing.
On s390x, it makes sure the allocated memory resides at
addresses below 2 GB.  This is necessary, as many of the
I/O subsystem data structures as defined by the hardware
contain pointer fields that are still 31-bit, even on
64-bit machines.  Thus we have to make sure those data
structures are allocated below 2 GB.  Using the GFP_DMA
mechanism for that purpose seemed to be the way to go ...
Note that contrary to the usual purpose of GFP_DMA on Intel,
the actual *data* that is being transferred via the I/O 
subsystem can reside at arbitrary addresses (which are 
specified via indirect-addressing lists); it is only the 
control data structures that need to go below 2 GB.
Bye,
Ulrich
