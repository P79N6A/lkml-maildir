That's too bad...

How?  Are these apps expecting all set bits to correspond to online
cpus?

I don't think so.
For one, that would be mucking around with a kernel/userspace ABI, I
guess.
Additionally, it would mean that the result of sched_getaffinity would
vary with the number of online cpus in the system, which I don't think
is desirable.
