You might take a look at
$ man iptables
...
TARGETS

QUEUE means to pass the packet to userspace (if supported by the kernel).
$ sed -n -e '1874,1876p' /usr/src/linux-2.4.0/Documentation/Configure.help
CONFIG_IP_NF_QUEUE
  Netfilter has the ability to queue packets to user space: the
  netlink device can be used to access them using this driver.
$ lynx /usr/share/doc/iptables/html/packet-filtering-HOWTO-7.html
