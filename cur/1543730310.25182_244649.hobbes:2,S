For power saving, HLT is hard to beat ;-) You note HLT as if there was 
some good reason not to use it... Mask everything except some BACK2WORK 
int from the night watchman CPU. I would really like this on some 
machines which seem to leave all CPUs generating heat even when booted 
with a uni kernel.
Whilst thinking about this, *if* using HLT is practical in therms of 
power saving, perhaps all but the last CPU could HLT if the run queue 
was empty, and only be awakened by the "last" CPU, in some case where 
the run queue length was longer than {some_value}.
