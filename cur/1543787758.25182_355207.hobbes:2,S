OK - looks like a scheduling-while-atomic warning on a metdata
buffer read, then a panic (sometime later?) at do_page_fault
with no useful stack trace (removed by bug reporter? - thats
the one you need...).  The first stack trace (atomic/shedule)
would not be >4K afaict, so thats a red herring I think.
cheers.
