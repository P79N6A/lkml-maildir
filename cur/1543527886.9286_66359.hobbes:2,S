All,
Caldera just brought down an OpenLinux 2.4 Release with a new LIZARD
utility that fixes this network spamming problem.  We tested it against
our Windows NT/2000 DHCP/TCPIP Routers and NT DNS servers, and the
LIZARD install no longer seems to have a network spamming option as part
of the install.  I am told that Caldera will have this fix up on their
web site ASAP.  This build seems to fix the Network Spamming problems. 
I am going on my third install, and it seems to be ok (although the
NetWare client is not loading the correct namespace frame and has debug
info turn on).
Jeff
