Right.  And getting the permission to create the derived work is contingent on your
agreeing that if it is distributed, the derived work is GPL.

It's quite possible and legal to *create* a derived work without agreeing to the
GPL.  However, the only things you can legally *do* with the work are use it
on your own system, and brag about how cool your code is.
You most certainly can't distribute it as non-GPL.
