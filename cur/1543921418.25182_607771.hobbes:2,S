Thanks for catching these, Milton.
I had done my testing against 2.6.23-rc8-mm2 and earlier, so had not
picked up your earlier debug sysctl patches from Oct 12 or so that
first fixed this, so had not noticed that the resulting merge of your
work and mine was borked.
... somedays even the latest *-mm just isn't good enough.
