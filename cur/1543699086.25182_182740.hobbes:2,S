huh?

After ignoring .devfsd we are left with 70 devices missing:
 - 15 floppy devices
 - 5 input/ devices
 - full, kmem, kmsg, mem, null, port, random, urandom, zero
 - printers/0 
 - 5 misc/ devices
 - 12 snd/ devices
 - 5 sound/ devices
 - 18 vcc/ devices
I wouldn't call udev deprecated, unless a newer kernel has the
essential devices, too. And is there a udev version that can
do devfs names? last time I checked only lanana names were supported.
Some distributions were quite happy to move from /dev and lanana to
devfs with better names. I doubt everyone will rush to udev with
lanana names, and re-introducing makedev for devices not represented
in sysfs doesn't sound very nice either. So 2.8.* might be a nice time
frame for dropping devfs, or at least give sysfs and udev a few months
to catch up on the issues mentioned.
