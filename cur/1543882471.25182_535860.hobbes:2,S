User input doesn't account for all system activity. Think of cron jobs
or user initiated jobs that may have started before the cycle began.

Noooo! If the user looses data, the user will be concerned and we should
be. I for one would do my best to avoid using software that loses my
data for me. I wouldn't care if you said "Well, it's your fault. You
lost the data." From my perspective as a user, I didn't lose the data,
some part of the computer's OS did.

Sorry, but I just don't believe filesystems should need to throw away
metadata post resume. If we let data be changed after snapshotting (or
ourselves cause it to be changed), we're the ones that are broken. Our
snapshot is out of date and the expectations of userspace programs that
were snapshotted will be out of date. Just imagine, for example, a
userspace program that is snapshotted, then reads and deletes a
temporary file. After the snapshot restore, it's running again. But
wait, we can't read or delete the file again because it's already gone.
Life just gets more complicated and confusing this way.

Maybe, but I'd still rather be encouraging!
