That sounds like something "invisible" is eating your CPU.  Perhaps
some interrupt handling.
Do a "cat /proc/interrupts", wait a few seconds and do it again.  See
if any count jumped by a lot.  I assume, but don't actually know, that
interrupts that are not handled are still counted.

On my machine, when not doing anything, I get a lot of timer
interrupts.
