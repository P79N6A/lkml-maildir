Pinging the system works and the the time is still correct. But this time I 
was not able to trigger a kernel warning, because I was not able to generate 
a long lockup. Maybe I'll have to wait a few more hours before trying it 
again, because the duration of the lockup is proportional to the time skype 
is running.
