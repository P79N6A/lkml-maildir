I don't think that linux ever got the physical geometry of this
hard disk correct.
I'll check the 2.0.x series tonight when I get home
But the logical geometry wat correctly read from the BIOS by 2.1.131

I'll try to play around with my LILO settings tonight.
I was aware of the possibility of setting the geometry manually, but
since it worked ok on 2.1.131 I wondered if the new results are 
a bug or not.
BTW: LBA is used in the BIOS on this drive
Andries asked me about hdparm -i (-I) results and
they seemed to be the same in both 2.1.131 and 2.2.0.pre5/6
I posted them onto the kernel mailing list
