...sorry for the reply to myself.
As Gentoo user i'm happy about the freedom of choice in almost every aspect of 
the system.
But with the kernel this freedom is taken away and i'm left with largely 
choices other people did. Sure, i can get the sources and patch and change 
the kernel myself in every aspect but thats more the possibility given by the 
freedom of the open source of the kernel.
I think the kernel should be more open for new ideas, and as long as the 
maintainer follows the kernel development things can be left in, if the 
maintainer can't follow anymore they are taken out quite fast again. (This 
statement mostly counts for parts of the kernel where a choice is possible or 
the coding overhead of making such choice possible is quite low.)
A problem of Linux is there are 100s of patches and patchsets out there but if 
you want to have more than one (since they offer advantages or functionality 
in different places) you are mostly left alone, start to integrate all 
patches by hand and solve so many rejects.
..still a happy CK user, but sad that Con left the scene.
Dirk.
