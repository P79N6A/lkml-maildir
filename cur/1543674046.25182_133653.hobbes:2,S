 Sounds good. I'll try that.

 If you use request_firmware() directly, userspace will not find any
 file to write to :-)
 If you really want to be able to do that, instead of using
 request_firmware() you could register a class_device of class firmware
 and implement 'size'_show/store and 'data'_read/write. Thus exposing
 the firmware memory to userspace. The sequence would be like this:
	- On size_store you setup the download.
	- You can write directly to the device's memory on data_write.
	- Once you get all data you get the device back working.
 With this approach, you get the hotplug event for free and can take
 advantage of compatible userspace scripts.
 This is not currently possible, but should be easy to do if found
 interesting. I'll provide a (non-functional) sample next time.
 Thanks
