Thanks for all the input Ingo, Here's a list of all the permutations I've tried:
setup                    Thruput      CPU% from cyclesoak
2.6.21-rc5 vanilla       935          29%
2.6.21-rc5-rt5           711          50% //basically all of 1 cpu
2.6.21-rc5-rt8           733          52%
2.6.21-rc5-rt8           824          64%
   netperf @50        
   hardirq @50
   softirq @50
2.6.21-rc5-rt8           937          74%
   netperf @51
   hardirq @50
   softirq @50
2.6.21-rc5-rt8           106          8%
   netperf @51
   hardirq @49
   softirq @50
2.6.21-rc5-rt8           233          14%
   netperf @51
   hardirq @49
   softirq @48
2.6.21-rc5-rt8           67           5%
   netperf @batch
   hardirq @batch
   softirq @batch
2.6.21-rc5-rt8           331           OFF
   netperf @batch
   hardirq @batch
   softirq @batch
   cyclesoak off   
Any thoughts?
