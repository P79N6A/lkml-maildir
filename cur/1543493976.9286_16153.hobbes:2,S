Well, I use scsidev so all disks are given convenient names
based on their vendor identifier and serial number. I can replace
the controllers, change the id jumpers on drives and my systems
just stubbornly work. I believe devfs can do something similar
at the controller/id level if not the vendor/serial no. level.
