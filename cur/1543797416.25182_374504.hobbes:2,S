Framing the discussion in terms of "like" and "dislike" proves you 
understand nothing about the issues -- and lacking that understanding, 
you feel its best to insult people.
libata suspend/resume needs to work on platforms without ACPI, such as 
ppc64.  libata reset needs to work even when BIOS is not present at all. 
  And by definition, anything that is done in ACPI can be done in the 
driver.
The only thing libata cannot know is BIOS defaults.  Anything else 
libata doesn't know is a driver bug.  We already know there are a ton of 
settings that should be saved/restored, which is not done now.  Until 
that code is added to libata, talk of ACPI is premature.  Further, even 
the premature patch was obviously unacceptable, because you don't patch 
ACPI code directly into libata and SCSI.  That's the wrong approach.
