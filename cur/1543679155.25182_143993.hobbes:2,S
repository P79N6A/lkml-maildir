Maybe it's not obvious to the none BK users.  BK _replicates_ the database
of revision history.
	cd /tmp
	bk clone /repos/l/linux/linux-2.5 
	rm -rf /repos/l/linux/linux-2.5
	bk clone /tmp/linux-2.5 /repos/l/linux/linux-2.5
That's a noop.  Nothing was lost.  And BK is excellent at incremental
updates, far better than anything else in existence.  
And BK does in file and cross file integrity checks.
So backing up using BK to another mirror is faster, simpler, and more
reliable.
