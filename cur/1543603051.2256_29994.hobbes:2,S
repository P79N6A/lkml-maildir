I'm submitting a machine to four runs of kernel+modules compile under
MAKE="make -j4" (the same kernel each time). Machine is a bi-PII 350, 
384Mo ram.
Swap:
787384k (priority -1) (raid1 over scsi)
95164k (priority -2) (raid1 over ide)
2.4.10-ext3:
real    103m39.305s	103m37.916s	103m49.334s	105m17.045s
user    97m9.060s	97m10.450s	97m9.300s	97m9.550s	
sys     4m4.900s	4m3.590s	4m5.670s	4m7.050s
2.4.9-ac17:
real    53m25.069s	53m11.890s	53m7.808s	53m24.110s
user    97m42.970s	97m41.280s	97m43.270s	97m40.650s
sys     5m2.130s	5m1.090s	4m57.440s	5m1.520s
Some graphs from vmstat 1 output are available at
http://www.cogenit.fr/linux/bench/2.4.9-ac17/
http://www.cogenit.fr/linux/bench/2.4.10-ext3/img/
Only the first two runs are available for 2.4.10-ext3 (I lused on vmstat 
output file, test is about to be reissued).
