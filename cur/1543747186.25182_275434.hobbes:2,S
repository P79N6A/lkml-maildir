Mmm. I wonder how much code that would require us to add. I do like the
idea of not interacting where the answer is obvious :>. I still think,
however, that interacting when the answer isn't obvious is the right
thing to do. Take for example the case where we find an image, but the
device numbers look like they belong to 2.4 and we're a 2.6 kernel. We
can't read the header (we can't be sure that this is the cause). The
user - or their cat - might have selected the wrong boot image
unintentionally. Why shouldn't we give them the opportunity to reboot
and get the right one?
