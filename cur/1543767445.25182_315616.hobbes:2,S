I have the same problem with a 2.6.11 kernel on an IBM T43, also with the new
Sonoma chipset. 
Although a PATA HDD, it appears to be presented as a SATA device (/dev/sda in
Linux). It seems to be hanging on the first disk access following a resume, and
I'm seeing the same behaviour with both APM and ACPI.
Happy to provide any information/assistance that I can to help resolve this..
Regards,
Jon.
