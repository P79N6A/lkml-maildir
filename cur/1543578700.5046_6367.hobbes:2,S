THINK.
The "synchronous channel" can be _memory_. I just used the above as an
example of using a synchronous channel to make sure that the asynchronous
buses aren't screwing us.
You only need one bit of synchronous information. The example used the
very same bit that the irq flag on the device is anyway - which works on a
lot of devices simply because they need to read the status flags anyway
in order to handle the interrupt.
But if you have problems with that, just use an atomic flag off
"dev->private" instead. Big deal.
