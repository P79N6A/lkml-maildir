That was explanation, not excuse. If you want people to test your code,
you should prepare it in form comfortable for them to test. Sorry, but I
do not have time for searching where I can download code you need to
test. I think that many others potential testers do not use git too, and
link to patch or inlined patches much more comfortable for them.
