Does anyone have a theory that accounts for the fact that the zeroed 
section is always tail aligned and seems to be the same length?  The
data seems to be
[ good page ] [ GGGB ] [ more good pages ] [ GGGB ] etc.
where the GGG is the first 2817 bytes and the B is the last 1279 (decimal)
bytes.  That's just too weird to be random, right?

We can easily rule that out.  Steven, do a 
	dd if=/dev/zero of=USE_SOME_SPACE bs=1048576 count=500
which will eat up 500 MB and should eat up any bad blocks.  I _really_
doubt it is a bad disk.
Steven, if you have a copy of lmbench then use lmdd from that like so
	lmdd of=XXX opat=1 
and that will write non-zero data to the disk, you then remove that file
and if we are getting random crud from the disk then we won't have nulls.
