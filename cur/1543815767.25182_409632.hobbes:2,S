I understand the needs of swsusp, but no one took away CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU away... 
just that you need to also enable CONFIG_GENERICARCH to get it to work reliably, and
not see that printk... nothing else..
Iam still confused why you think swsusp wont work...
with that patch, try
CONFIG_X86_PC=n
CONFIG_GENERICARCH=y
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y
...
<whatever swssusp needs>=y
and see if thinks work out for you?
