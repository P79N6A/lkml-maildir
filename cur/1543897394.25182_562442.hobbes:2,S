I did. It (2.6.15) didn't. Between 2.6.10 and 2.6.15 the 
suspend API changed. It was documented that it would change 
and break things and so it did. Is that what "stable" is 
about ?

Debian stable/testing/unstable ? 
FreeBSD 5.5/FreeBSD 6.2 ?

I was asking for a stable kernel, like 2.4, 2.2, 2.0 were 
before. 2.6 is not. It's a great kernel, better than that 
of MacOS X, I never said you were doing a bad job, quite 
the contrary. I wouldn't be using Linux since 10 years if I 
thought it stinks. I never asked support for closed source 
drivers, only a stable kernel. 
Whatever "stable" means.
