There are two clear uses
#1	Its possible to write such a module to allow only some ports to be
accessed, eg to export a PCI device for learning purposes
#2	As root you can make mistakes and mess up a box. Having the ability
to do stuff and having the default as "its allowed" differ. Giving
someone iopl rights is a bit like giving someone sudo. The security
against active attack is unchanged, the security against screwups is
higher
