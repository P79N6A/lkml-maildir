Pheew (this is sarcastic)
You're fully correct, after toying a bit on win2k, I crashed it a few
times with weird errors and I must say, these blue screens in win2k look
a *lot* better than the ones I used to see in win98 ;-). They still
don't match that wonderful "kernel panic", though.
So, basically, my bios must have loaded the wrong options for my memory
which must run above it's limits which causes data corruption... Then,
my stupid question, why doesn't memtest86 detect that?
Anyway, I'll go look at the bios settings of the computers, look at the
CAS/RAS/clock timing settings like two people suggested (thanks :-) )
and hope to be happy and have a stable machine after that.
Thanks for this half-solution :-)
