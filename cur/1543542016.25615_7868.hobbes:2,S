OK, thanks. If anyone out there knows, I'd still like to find out
why this is normally only done for TCP packets <= 68 bytes.

Which function mods the head? As far as I can see, for big packets the
"init" function puts the pseudo-header checksum in skb->csum, while the
"complete" function (include/net/tcp.h not net/ipv4/tcp.c -- my apologies)
checks the rest of the packet.  Why the split?
