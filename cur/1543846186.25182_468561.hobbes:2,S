Hi Norbert,
  we've been just through an email thread where it has been
  determined that wpa_supplicant 0.4.9 (I would assume that
  0.5.5 is also okay) and wireless-tools from Jean's latest
  tarball are necessary to work with the recent wireless
  extensions v21 that have been merged in.
What wireless-tools are you using ?
Ciao,
