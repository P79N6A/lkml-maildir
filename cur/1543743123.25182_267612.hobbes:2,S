I'm using 2.6.10-rc1-mm2 currently, on a dual Opteron w/ Tyan Thunder K8W.

I can't confirm this.  I've just set CONFIG_HPET and friends (except for 
CONFIG_HPET_RTC_IRQ) and nothing wrong happens.

This does not happen on my system.

I see this effect too, but I'd attribute it to the fact that on my board the 
whole I/O is attached to one of the processors (then it's CPU1, I'd bet).

This happens on my system too.
