yes.

hmm.

NUMA was enabled all the time (at least most of the time). I don't know if 
I ever ran it without NUMA. I'll certainly try that.
Unfortunately, I won't be able to do any reboots during the next one or 
two weeks since the machine has gone into stable operation tonight. (with 
some loss of memory for now)
if it is of some interest, that's what dmesg tells about NUMA:
     BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
      BIOS-e820: 0000000000000000 - 000000000009fc00 (usable)
      BIOS-e820: 000000000009fc00 - 00000000000a0000 (reserved)
      BIOS-e820: 00000000000e0000 - 0000000000100000 (reserved)
      BIOS-e820: 0000000000100000 - 00000000bfff0000 (usable)
      BIOS-e820: 00000000bfff0000 - 00000000bffff000 (ACPI data)
      BIOS-e820: 00000000bffff000 - 00000000c0000000 (ACPI NVS)
      BIOS-e820: 00000000ff780000 - 0000000100000000 (reserved)
      BIOS-e820: 0000000100000000 - 0000000140000000 (usable)
     Scanning NUMA topology in Northbridge 24
     Number of nodes 2 (10010)
     Node 0 MemBase 0000000000000000 Limit 000000013fffffff
     Skipping disabled node 1
     Using node hash shift of 24
     Bootmem setup node 0 0000000000000000-000000013fffffff
     No mptable found.
     On node 0 totalpages: 1310719
       DMA zone: 4096 pages, LIFO batch:1
       Normal zone: 1306623 pages, LIFO batch:16
       HighMem zone: 0 pages, LIFO batch:1
So actually it looks like the kernel well notices that only one processor
has access to the memory here.
