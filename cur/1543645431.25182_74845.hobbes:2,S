David,
Linus applied 0.13a and that fixes things, thanks.
Two quick comments:
* you need pci_set_drvdata(pdev,NULL) after pci_disable_disable in your 
pci_driver::remove hook
* I think it would look better to remove the struct pci_driver ->suspend 
and ->resume hook references, if they are NULL (0)...
