I have seen the umount oops -but- not 100% of the time. No time
 to copy the oops text since my laptop powers off, and as the
 issue occurred two times out of five or six, I haven't yet had
 a very strong need to hunt this further, confident someone more
 clueful than me (possibly the vast majority of l-k :) would do
 very soon. It looks like it happened. Heh. As always.

OK, going to the usual patch/build/reboot/test sequence now.
Will let you know in 2 days at most. Thanks !
