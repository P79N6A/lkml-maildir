thing is, we have several things we should care about
and some of them 'look' or 'sound' similar, although
they are not really ... I'll try to clarify
 first, we want to have 'per guest' interfaces, which
 do not clash with any interfaces on the host or in
 other guests
 then, we want to 'connect' them, implicitely or 
 explicetly with 'other' interfaces or devices inside
 other guests or on the host, here we have the following
 cases (some are a little special):
 - lo interface, guest and host private (by default)
 - tap/tun interfaces, again host/guest private
 - tun like interfaces between host and guests
 - tun like interfaces between guests
 - 'normal' interfaces mapped into guests
 on the traffic side we have the following cases:
 - local traffic on the host
 - local traffic on the guest
 - local traffic between host and guest
 - local traffic between guests
 - routed traffic from guest via host
 - bridged traffic from guest via host
 special cases here would be tun/tap traffic inside
 a guest, but that can be considered local too

this depends on the way the interfaces are handled
and how they actually work, means:
 if the interfaces _solely_ work via routing or
 bridging, then the 'host' end has to exist and be
 visible similar to 'normal' interfaces
 if the traffic is (magically) mapped from guest
 interfaces to real (outside) host interfaces, we
 might want the same view as the guest has 
 (i.e. basically a 'copy' which is not real)

IMHO input is always welcome .. helps the folks to
do better thinking :)
