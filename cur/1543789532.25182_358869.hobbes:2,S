Well UDP doesn't have a timeout because it's connectionless, but
TCP (stream sockets) do. Look in /proc/sys/net/ipv4 and see if you
can find what you want. You probably are looking for tcp_fin_timeout
if you are concerned about what `netstat -c` shows after a disconnection.
FYI, If you are just trying to reuse an address, you don't have
to muck with kernel parameters, just `man setsockopt` SO_REUSEADDR, etc.
Cheers,
