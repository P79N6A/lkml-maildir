You do understand that GNU coreutils, bash etc. are among those
programs, right?  As in "touch zöe.txt" creates a non-conforming
filename...

The question of what a program like this should do has not been
answered:
   perl -e 'for (glob "*") { rename $_, "ņi-".$_ or die "rename: $!\n"; }'
   (NB: The prefix string is N WITH CEDILLA followed by "i-").
Hint: it mangles perfectly fine non-ASCII file names, instead of just
prefixing the prefix string.  If you change the program to correctly
prepend the prefix string, then it mangles non-UTF-8 names, which is
arguably correct, but can result in you losing some files.
This _is_ a userspace problem, but it is a genuine problem for which
no good answer is yet apparent.
