Thanks for taking an interest.
I ran the commands and  got the result shown
below. Anything else you want me to try?
# hdparm -S1 -C /dev/sda; sleep 6; hdparm -C /dev/sda
/dev/sda:
 setting standby to 1 (5 seconds)
 drive state is:  active/idle
/dev/sda:
 drive state is:  active/idle
Should I give sdparm a shot?
