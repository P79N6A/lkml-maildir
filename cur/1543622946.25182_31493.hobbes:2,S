All accesses go to the filesystem mounted last. The one mounted first
is inaccessible until you unmount the filesystem covering it. Well,
not really inaccessible, if any process happened to have a working
directory or an open file on the first filesystem at the time you
mounted the second, it can still access it.
There is nothing special involved, after all, it's the same as if you
mount a single filesystem to /mnt, the only difference is that the
second mount this time doesn't cover a single dirtree on the root
partition, but instead it covers a complete other filesystem.
