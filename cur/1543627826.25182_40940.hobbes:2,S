It seems an obvious help would be to have the option of spinning up
the drives one at a time at 2-3 second intervals.  I know a fast drive
doesn't get up to speed in 3 seconds, but the nastiest draw is going
to be over by then.
A machine with 32 drives is pretty serious stuff and probably isn't
booting in a few seconds anyway--another 60-some seconds might be a
desirable option.
Does this exist anywhere?  Would it have to be a BIOS feature?
