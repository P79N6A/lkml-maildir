Hi,
during make bzImage on 2.6 I notoriously get this warning:
[exerpt]
  LD      vmlinux
  AS      arch/i386/boot/setup.o
arch/i386/boot/setup.S: Assembler messages:
arch/i386/boot/setup.S:165: Warning: value 0x37ffffff truncated to 0x37ffffff
  LD      arch/i386/boot/setup
  OBJCOPY arch/i386/boot/compressed/vmlinux.bin
[eo exerpt]
I have been browsing through the archives and I got the feeling
that this has been already been approached. But I am getting this
since I ever tried 2.5 (about 2.5.53). By 2.6.0-test9-bk11 it is
still there. I have been compiling on 2 different machines. I have
their specs.
Is there anything I could supply to try to resolve this?
Maybe it's no biggy.
Regards,
Maciej
