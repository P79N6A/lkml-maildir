You prob want to try:

With the bios at:

I do not see anything HT specific, except a logo thing (maybe).

Well, its a matter of opinion I guess, but I have always had
good results with Asus motherboards.  All Asus bords with chipset
supporting HT have BIOS updates to enable support.  Also, if you
look at older A7N8X (Nforce2 chipset) boards, they now have support
for 400Mhz CPU even if not the Ultra400 Chipset (BIOS update) ... makes
a difference if you do not have money to upgrade =)
