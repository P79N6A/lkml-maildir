but we regularly do this in generic code: we add calls that are NOPs on 
some architectures. For example flush_cache_page() makes no sense on the 
x86 architecture. So i'm inclined to apply Harvey's cleanup - less
#ifdef complexity in higher-level code is very much favored, even
if "riprel" is a NOP concept on 32-bit.
