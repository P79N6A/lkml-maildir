Precisely - complaining that you would rather have your box die
uncontrollably, because you are sitting there holding its hand 24x7 to
watch the lights go out, is hardly productive. If you ARE monitoring it
closely enough to fix things, you would fix them long before the disaster
recovery OOM routine cuts in!

Plenty of people have CPU leak detectors, which will renice (and later
kill) processes which take more than a certain length of time. This is an
absolute godsend for stopping things like Netscape which have a horrible
habit of going into a busy loop, eating 100% of CPU time until killed.
Something similar to implement crude per-user quotas could be useful -
just check periodically how much RAM each user is using, and tell them if
they exceed their quota (a "soft" quota) - would probably address the
"normal" low-memory situation (exploding Netscapes etc.)

Agreed. Complaining about Rik's patch "killing my poor defenceless
process, which had blown up for a good reason - I really DID want it to
exhaust all my swapspace and then kill itself, not be killed by the big
bad nasty kernel!" is ridiculous. The processes it kills will almost
always be killed because they are causing serious problems for the system.
A process only gets killed in this way to protect overall system
integrity, not as a matter of routine housekeeping.
