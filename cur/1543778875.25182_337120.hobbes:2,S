~2800 lines of which is a new driver.
It'd be nice if ALSA's release schedule for "stable" versus "rc" could match 
the kernel's. For example, 2.6.12 shipped with 1.0.9rc2.
Maybe "rc" ALSA should only be accepted in rc1, by rc4 you hope they can wrap 
things up and give you a stable version number? Okay, generally in-tree 
version numbers don't count for much, but I think ALSA is a big exception 
because it's maintained pretty much out of tree.
Not so much of an issue this time around, but I don't think new drivers or 
rewrites (even if they are reasonably separate) should be going in a late -rc 
kernel.
Just my two pence.
