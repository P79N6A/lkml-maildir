Sanity check. If the environment cannot replicate itself, then
something has been faulty in the cross-compiling stage, that was used
to propagate a native environment for the target architecture.

You've already dismissed a shell version to correct the issue, in
hopes of a "possible" C version. It would be nice, I'm not capable of
doing it personally, but a solution already exists to "unbreak" the
kernel build. If you're unwilling to merge the current patches, then
feel free to claim that this doesn't break anything on current
architectures, but it's incorrect, due to Perl not even compiling as
is currently on a native uclibc environment.
I look forward to what other tools will be introduced to break yet
more architectures until the kernel cannot be compiled unless on an
i686+glibc architecture.
