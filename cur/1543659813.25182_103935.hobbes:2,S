I have installed a 4.2.99.3 XFree86 on my laptop and needed newer
i810/i830 DRM drivers to be able to get DRI working. Current version in
the 2.5.58 kernel is 1.2.1 and a version > 1.3 is needed.  I copied all
i8* files from the XFree86 CVS linux drm directory to drivers/char/drm
and this made DRI working again. 
Is an update of the kernel drivers foreseen so that it will work
seamlessly when XFree86 4.3 is published?
