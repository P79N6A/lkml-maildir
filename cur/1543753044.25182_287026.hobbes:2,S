What do you think about the point we are trying to make, i.e., moving the
ranking of PIDs to be killed to user space? Or, making user have some influence
on it? We were misunderstood because the patch we sent was to make "a slight"
organization in the way OOM killer compute rates to PIDs, not to change its
selection logic. But now, we can discuss (I mean implement)
alternative selection
logics without messing the code at kernel space. The parameters and
criteria on how
to combine them can be open to more people test it according to platform and, if
not user, at least according to application memory consumpition pattern.
Well, while AF_TELEPATH socket is not on its way :) ... we may at
least experiment
different raking policies.
