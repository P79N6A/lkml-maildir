Unfortunately, Ulrich's taste was incompatible with mine in almost all
cases I can recall. So "together" is very likely to be "hand-to-hand".
glibc is hopelessly ugly. If it can be made cleaner without making
the kernel API ugly - wonderful. If not - too bad. For glibc.
IOW, if you can propose clean API - do it. If Ulrich can do that - great,
I'm more than willing to listen. I'm not holding my breath on the last
one, though.
PS: The day when Linus will really switch to accepting API changes without
thinking about them will be the day when I stop work on his tree.
So far it had not happened and I like it that way, thank you very much.
