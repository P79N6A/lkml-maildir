The better answer was to invert it and use "discarded_kernel_text_address()",
which is what you actually care about (rather than the details of whether it
was init or not).
However, you have, in fact, located a potential bug.  If someone were to
kmalloc module text, then symbol_put() could fail.
How's this?
---
Don't report discarded init pages as kernel text.
In theory this could cause a bug in symbol_put() if an arch used for
a module: we might think the symbol belongs to the core kernel.
The downside is that this might make backtraces through (discarded)
init functions harder to read on some archs.
