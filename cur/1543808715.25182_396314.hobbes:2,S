According to Wikipedia, and what I knew besides, FAT32 has a limit of 2 To
for the whole filesystem. But the limit I was talking of is the file size
limit: 4 Go perfile. Which is, nowadays, a bit short: an ISO image for a
DVD-R does not fit, for example.

I am not sure about that: you can not do really good algorthms on bad data
structures, and the data structures of FAT do not provide any support to do
smart allocation.

That is interesting. Do you know how efficient UDF is compared to others
filesystems on normal hard drives? It is optimized for CDs and DVDs, I would
not be surprised if the performances were poor on different supports.

I believe that such options should not be done on a per-filesystem basis.
Something in the common code of the VFS would be more logical.

The idea was to mount the disk with its haphazard UIDs, and then export it
and mount it as a network filesystem over the loopback. By itself, it is
absolutely useless, but networked filesystems have UIDs mapping facilities.
