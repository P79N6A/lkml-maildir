Hi Ingo, I'm the young UML hacker you met at OLS and who got your UML patches 
sent ;-)
I've been studying your patch (and the whole Linux VM, indeed) in the past 
days, and I have some remarks, about the version of the code in 2.6.4-rc2-mm1 
(which is the same you sent me) - I've now downloaded the version dropped 
from 2.6.5-mm1, but it doesn't seem to address those problems.
Btw, I've now seen why that patch was dropped, but not why it wasn't resubmit.
*) with your patch, remapped pages without MAP_INHERIT are IMHO not safe 
across swapout; re-swapping them in will pass through the arch-specific fault 
handler, which will check VMA's protections, and fail if the VMA originally 
had MAP_NONE. Or am I missing something?
*) with the same binary, a call to mprotect() on a nonlinear VMA will no more 
change the protections over fremap'ed PTEs (more exactly, PTEs going through 
handle_pte_fault->do_file_page(), but it seems that _PAGE_FILE is only set by 
fremap()).
Currently mprotect fixes up the VMA and changes the protections for present 
pages (see mm/mprotect.c:change_pte_range(), it's a no-op on not-present 
pages). On not-present pages, the new VMA protections are loaded, even in 
do_file_page.
I propose adding a VM_NOINHERIT flag (reusing VM_MAPPED_COPY on MMU archs) to 
be set on VMA's on which protections are not to be inherited.
Normal VMA's behave as before, as soon as I remap_file_pages without 
MAP_INHERIT (or with MAP_NOINHERIT, see below) that flag is set on the VMA, 
on which, then, mprotect won't work.
*) btw, adding a new syscall is not needed, adding a MAP_NOINHERIT flag for 
remap_file_pages to ask for the new behaviour is more than enough:
(inside sys_remap_file_pages)
-       if (__prot)
-               return err;
+       if (prot && !(flags & MAP_NOINHERIT))
+               goto out;
Also, I've seen that a lot of fixes from your code haven't been merged; in 
particular, currently MAP_PRIVATE |  MAP_POPULATE is broken (while it was 
fixed by your patch, which only required VM_SHARED on the VMA if there was an 
actual non-linear mapping).
*) I don't understand this hunk (inside filemap_populate, not replicated 
inside shmem_populate):
        struct page *page;
        int err;
+       /*
+        * mapping-removal fastpath:
+        */
+       if ((vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED) &&
+                       (pgprot_val(prot) == pgprot_val(PAGE_NONE))) {
+               zap_page_range(vma, addr, len);
+               return 0;
+       }
+
        if (!nonblock)
                force_page_cache_readahead(mapping, vma->vm_file,
I understand why it's done, but zap_page_range() will totally clear the PTE's, 
it won't set _PAGE_FILE on the PTEs (as far as I can see), causing the pages 
to be faulted again in, and this time linearly. This hunk is still in 
2.6.5-mm1 (or so it seems).
*) I don't understand at all the attached hunks in your patch (there's a long 
description about them). Verified they hadn't been dropped from the patch in 
2.6.5-mm1 (or so it seems).
Note: for 2.6.5-mm1, I'm referring to the patch inside the "dropped" directory 
in the archives.
Bye and thanks for your attention.

This is wrong because both routines can be called from within do_file_page,
which is called when !pte_present(pte) && !pte_none(pte) && pte_file(pte). I.e.
the pte is not zeroed, so it has been used, but the page has been swapped out,
or .
Actually, in that situation ->populate is called with nonblock == 0, so only
install_page can be called there. If ->populate fails, the faulting process
will get a SIGBUS; and this *could* happen.
The other caller is sys_remap_file_page. In that situation, we fail if
!(vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED), so we don't call ->populate.
Actually, however, we could be called inside mmap for MAP_POPULATE. However,
even in that case, old mappings have already been unmapped away.
And actually, in Ingo's patch things were different, because if
remap_file_pages was called only to change protections, without creating
non-linear mappings, we didn't punt even if the VM was not shared. So,
currently MAP_POPULATE will fail (though without returning any error) if the VMA
is private and not shared, without a real reason to do so.
But again, after mmap'ing an area, even with MAP_POPULATE, old mappings should
have been cleared, so what are we bothering about here?
