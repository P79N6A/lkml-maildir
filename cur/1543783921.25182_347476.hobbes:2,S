Subject: [patch 00/10] parport: ieee1284 fixes and cleanups

I played with a daisy chain device that is not ieee1284 compliant
and found buffer overflow and failure to open daisy chain devices.
While fixing it I found also a number of other problems also affecting
proper ieee1284 devices.
This is a collection of the changes I have made. They have been through
linux-parport mailing list already in January and they have been modified
according to comments.
