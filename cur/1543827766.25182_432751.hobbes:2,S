I don't mean to be obtuse, but the "Non-exclusive Non-commercial Limited-use 
Source" license seems to make something like that have limited usefulness in 
general. That is -- unless one were to obtain a commercial license from AT&T, 
but then that starts falling into the domain of what is likely prohibited by 
the GPL (some sort of proprietary work actually _derived_ off the kernel 
rather than just supporting it in some way).
But I did ask for examples...
