I'm not sure we want to do this - that's what ./MAINTAINERS is for and we
end up having to maintain the same info in two places.
I actually use git-whatchanged if I'm unsure who to blame^Wask for help on
a particular piece of code.
An easy way of doing this is to go to
http://git.kernel.org/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=tree
then drill down to the file and hit the "history" link.  That will tell you who
is *really* doing work on the particular code.
