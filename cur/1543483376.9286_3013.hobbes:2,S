   Ah, so they made a mistake of killing *all* ICMP packets.
The mistake is that then they essentially killed also the path-
MTU-discovery protocol, and they should configure their machine
to always send with MTU 572, OR turn off the discovery and
never send packets with DF flag set on...
HTTP/1.1 302 Object moved
Server: Microsoft-IIS/4.0
Cute...  So propably their only change is to reconfigure the FW..
