We prefer the "right" fix, however painful or risky that might be.

Hope so.

Ah.  I think the return value from these functions should mean "something
disruptive happened", if you like.
See, the callers of cond_resched_lock() aren't interested in whether
cond_resched_lock() actually called schedule().  They want to know whether
cond_resched_lock() dropped the lock.  Because if the lock was dropped, the
caller needs to take some special action, regardless of whether schedule()
was finally called.
So I think the patch I queued is OK, agree?
