For this issue, it takes just a simple mechanism and little workload.
Aside from the 2 processors involved in the test, the rest of the system
is fairly idle.  Basically, it looks like the following:
Thread pinned to processor A waits in the kernel on a mutex.
Thread pinned to processor B sets up some timer hardware to interrupt
processor A at a specified instant in time.
Processor A gets the interrupt and records an RTC time stamp,
then trips the mutex to wake the sleeping thread on this same cpu.
Thread on A wakes up and records another RTC time stamp.
Thread on A opens a results file.  Should the difference between the
timestamps be > some threshold, data is written out to the file.  The
file is then closed.
Thread on A waits again on the mutex.
If I look at the stack for processor A at the threshold time, it's always
somewhere in file_free_rcu.  Nominal values for this test are well below
threshold (even now).
And again, setting either CONFIG_PREEMPT or the equivalent of
CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY (setting might_resched()=cond_resched()) makes
no difference.

I haven't tried it.
Thanks.
