'sel' is a variable, so gcc can't provide it as an immediate operand.  
Specifying it as "rm" instead of "g" would have been better, but can't 
have any real influence.

Well, for the code you posted in in the gcc bug, it probaby generated 
something like
    mov $0, %fs
which is indeed invalid assembly.  But the kvm miscompile is something 
else (running out of registers or something like that).
