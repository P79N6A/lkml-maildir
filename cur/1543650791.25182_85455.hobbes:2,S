Actually the rules did change. read the DMCA. It's illegal to
break the security, regardless of the reason. So you have fair
use rights, but cannot take atvantage of them.
Same as the DVD and Ebook cases. Breaking the protection is
illegal. Eventually this will hit the courts, but it will take
several tries to win on fair use grounds.
