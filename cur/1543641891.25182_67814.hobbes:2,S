Hi all...
Back from summer holidays, and trying to catch the train again...
I gave up in 2.4.20-pre1. I have built now -pre5, and saw that some things
from -aa tree (or newer versions) went into mainline:
(from patch-2.4.20.log)
pre1 -> pre2:
 <hch@lst.de>:
  o small VM updates from -aa (1/5)
  o small VM updates from -aa (2/5)
  o small VM updates from -aa (4/5)
  o small VM updates from -aa (5/5)
  o minor VM changes from -aa (2/3)
  o minor VM changes from -aa (3/3)
  o Re: [PATCH] small VM updates from -aa (3/5)
 Jens Axboe <axboe@suse.de>:
  o Add block IO directly from highmem support
pre4 ->pre5:
Scott Feldman <scott.feldman@intel.com>:
  o e100 net driver update 1/3...
  o e1000 net driver update 1/5...
small bits for SMP, like alignments and so on.
I have tried to dig into MARC archives but found no message. Anyone has
a pointer to read what went in ?
BTW: Andrea, is there any -aa cooking ? I am trying to merge the rest of the
latest I had...
TIA
