Subject: [2.6.16-rc6 patch] fix interactive task starvation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Greetings,
The patch below fixes a starvation problem that occurs when a stream of
highly interactive tasks delay an array switch for extended periods
despite EXPIRED_STARVING(rq) being true.  AFAIKT, the only choice is to
enqueue awakening tasks on the expired array in this case.
Without this patch, it can be nearly impossible to remotely login to a
busy server, and interactive shell commands can starve for minutes.
This has not been verified by anyone.  Comments?
