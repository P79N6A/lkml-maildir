Subject: Linux fails to boot on a "theoretical" 4.3 Ghz x86 [PATCH]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/3/20/241

Working in the lab, we have found a bug where Linux 2.2.14 fails to
boot if a x86 processor is faster than 4.3Ghz.  This is caused because
it uses the rdtsc to calculate the processor speed in hz.  Since the
result is a 32-bit number, the frequency can not be allowed to be
> 2**32.
Enclosed is a simple patch make calculates cpu_khz instead of cpu_hz.
Please include this in the kernel source.
Think of this as a Y2K-like bug waiting to happen, I want Linux to be
ready. :)
PS: We do NOT have a processor running this fast, just one that lies
    to the OS.
