The petition came from a group of people in the OSU Open Source club,
not from the whole school (obviously) or even the whole club.

You apparently missed the fact that the the petition was not against the
*use* of proprietary software at all.  In fact, we explicitly mentioned
that everyone is free to make that choice individually.  What the
petition is against is the *advocacy* of the proprietary BitKeeper
software by the kernel maintainers.

The petition has nothing to do with the alumni of the Ohio State
University.
The rest of your message isn't worth responding to, so I won't.
