I've also done installs the other way round, and I can confirm that
with an IDE CD drive, it matters not whether the hard drives are IDE
or SCSI providing they're all the same.
However, with a SCSI CD drive, what appears to happen is as follows:
 1. The BIOS sees that we're booting from the CD, so switches
    the CD into floppy emulation mode, and loads the floppy
    image from the CD.
 2. The floppy image does whatever is required to switch the
    CD out of floppy emulation mode, amongst other things.
 3. The floppy image realises that to do a CD install with
    this setup, it needs to load a supplementary image from
    the CD.
 4. Because there's at least one IDE drive, the floppy image
    looks for an IDE CD drive.
 5. The floppy image fails to find one, so asks the user to
    insert the CD into the CD drive and press a key. When the
    user presses a key, it goes back to step 4.
However, both Red Hat and Alan Cox advise me that no such problem
exists as they've done the said install type many times, but neither
will advise me as to how such is achieved!!!
Best wishes from Riley.
