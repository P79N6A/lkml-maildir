Indian languages have complicated character/glyph mappings, similar to
Arabic but worse.
In general, these kinds of things is much better handled in user
space, similar to the way Asian languages are handled using the user
space console program "kon".  You would typically use the frame buffer
driver in the kernel and maintain the complicated state machines and
glyph sets in user space.
