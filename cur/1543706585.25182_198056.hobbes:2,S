Hi Linus, Andrew !
Here is the new radeonfb. It doesn't remove the old one, just in case,
though CONFIG_FB_RADEON now builds the new one.
I also had to add an empty fb_set_suspend() function to fbmem.c (the
real implementation is in James tree and will be here soon). That means
that Power Management on Apple laptops isn't completely right yet until
the core fbdev fixes get in, but that's probably enough for 2.6.3.
The patch is too big to put in the email text uncompressed, so here it
is as a bzip2 attachment.
James: The version in your tree is good too, when merging your stuff,
you should ignore the few radeonfb diffs and let me deal with them.
Linus: This new driver uses framebuffer_alloc/release, so if you back
out the fb sysfs patch, make sure to replace it with wrapper functions
that just kmalloc/kfree
Regards,
Ben.
