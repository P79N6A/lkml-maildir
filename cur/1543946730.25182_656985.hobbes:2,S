Most subsystems in the kernel would disqualify under that rule
Did you ever look for full documentation on how to write Ethernet
drivers for example? Some bits are documented, but far from all
I'm not defending that, but it's how it is.

That's a show stopper of course.

My advice is that you just read the source of some existing drivers
for examples and copy them and of the subsystem itself if anything is
unclear. That is how Linux drivers are usually written.
