Sorry, but I think you got me wrong: I didn't mean emulation of any
implementation, but probably the some thing you write above: emulation
of time/performance. In my opinion this should be done experimentally
too, but with something more objective and constant than current
"complaints counter". And the first thing could be a try to set some
kind of linux internal "standard of yeld" for the future by averaging
a few most popular systems in a test doing things like this iperf or
preferably more.
