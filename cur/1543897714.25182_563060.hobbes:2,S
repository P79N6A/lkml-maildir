Put a rule in iptables to jump to a user table to do a log and drop. You 
are doing it the wrong way, you want to set syslog to write the log 
message to a FIFO and have a permanent running program reading it (I do 
just this for other things).
Alternatively you can use redirect to send it to a program of your 
choosing, which can run a script if you really want to. Beware that rate 
limiting is desirable if you are going to start a process for ANY type 
of attack packets.
