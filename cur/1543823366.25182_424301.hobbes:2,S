NAK. That problem was inherited from another board driver which was
copied and modified. And that driver inherited it in turn... let's not
piss about with them one at a time; let's just fix them _all_ at once,
instead. And let's remove the bizarre use of '#ifdef MODULE' around the
cleanup functions while we're at it.
