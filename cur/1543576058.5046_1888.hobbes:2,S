OK, You have right, I'm not a driver programmer, but it probably should
look like this:

I think that can be "safely" added to the kernel source. :-)
Anyway nn kernel 2.4.0-test12 we have line:
include/linux/pci_ids.h:#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_OXSEMI_16PCI954   0x9501
Why serial.c from the 2.2.18 not support 921600 speed? We have to patch
it...
