I'd be much happier if the ACL interface moved into the VFS layer, and up
to individual file systems to support/not support ACL's. This way the
implementation would become isolated from the kernel support, allowing a
common set of user utilities, and user/OS interface.
random thoghts on, don't take too seriously:
The VFS interface shouldn't need much over a "get_next_ACL" call, providing
the inode number and ACL index.
