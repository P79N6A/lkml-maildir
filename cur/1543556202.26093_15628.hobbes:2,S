Right.  But the problem here was a new, unused sysctl-by-number, conflicted
with an old-but-not-integrated sysctl-by-number that is used. :)  The only
reason I made the number match the one in 2.4 was because a) i figured it's
not going to conflict. :) and b) incase something does come along and use it.
