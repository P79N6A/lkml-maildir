You should really reply-to-all, not just to LKML. I've added the
original recipients back.
I have to admit that I'm not sure. I haven't begun to try to write the
support yet, or even look at how the other implementations do
encryption. (Pointers welcome!) I assume there should be some option to
save it in a file and get it via the initrd, and/or perhaps require the
user to type in a passphrase at the lilo prompt.

point there is not so much to protect access to the image as to obscure
it? If so, the existing compression support in suspend2 probably helps
satisfy this requirement.
