the platform is a netsilicon NS9360 witch include an 100MBit ethernet 
device.
The driver came with the software(LxNETES) for the development board.
CPU load is 100% when running sender program.
cat /proc/interrupts; sleep 10; cat /proc/interrupts doen't work anymore 
because cpu is to busy.
Does sendto give other processes time when the hardware is transmitting 
data?
Is this bad hardware or is the cost of sendto that high.
