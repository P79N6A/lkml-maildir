Oh come on people.  Don't provide an empty function because the kernel
is complaining that you don't provide a release function.  Yes it will
shut the kernel up but did you ever think _why_ the kernel was
complaining?  Did you think it did it just for fun?
Think people, think...
You need to free your memory here, don't just provide an empty function,
that shows the driver is broken.
thanks,
