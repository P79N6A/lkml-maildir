Ok, I realize - this seems to be confusing. I'll try to clarify:
- First of all, mere mortals are _not_ allowed to compile mandatory
  alpha IEEE fp emulation code as a module. Which is documented
  in arch/alpha/Kconfig.
- Roughly speaking, the fp emu _module_ code intercepts the fp traps,
  so races vs module loading/unloading are fundamentally unavoidable.
  These refcounting attempts just narrow the window.
And no, try_module_get should never fail here.
Alternatively, we could just drop _all_ module related stuff from
alpha/math-emu...
Ivan.
