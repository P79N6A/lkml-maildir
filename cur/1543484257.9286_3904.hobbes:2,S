Probably not. This thing happens only when there's both a lot of tty
open/close *and* a lot of inode accesses. I found it while running the
egcs testsuites, which use dejagnu, which uses expect, which does a
lot of pty manipulations :-)
I must say I'm pretty clueless on what's going on. Looks like a
locking issue to me. Again, it might be an SMP-only thing...
