He wasn't expecting me to post the benchmark, and I frankly only looked
at the real time and forgot there was a systime in there that needed
cutting out when I posted it. My error, not his. I must say though, the
real time makes me quite happy, especially considering how CPUs are just
going to keep getting faster.
