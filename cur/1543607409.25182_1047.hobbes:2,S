Yep.  Newer initscripts from RedHat and Mandrake (and others?) require
CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV.  initscripts runs, IIRC, iproute, which in turn
requires the netlink device.
I have a feeling this is going to be a FAQ.  Pretty much anybody who
uses these initscripts and compiles their own kernel !CONFIG_NETLINK_DEV
will hit this.
