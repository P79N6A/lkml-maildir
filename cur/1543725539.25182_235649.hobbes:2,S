That could be done by sending in smaller patches that remove devfs calls
from drivers.  If nothing in the kernel is using devfs, then there is no
reason to keep it around anymore...
Just a thought.

please don't do it /*at least not in the following two months :-)*/
what does this buy us ?
once again about the upcoming Mandrake 10.1,
we already have readded devfs support to isdn,
should we start tracking bk-head for such patches
that remove devfs support from drivers
and revert them ? 
should we stay with 2.6.7 (or eventually 2.6.8)?
there is really no time to integarate/test udev
as replacement of devfs for the next release.
best,
svetljo
