Dunno what the problem was, but the 2.4.5-ac15 problem I was having on the
4 way alphas is fixed in ac19.

>CPU 2 init(1): Oops 0
>pc = [<fffffc000034550c>]  ra = [<fffffc00003456ac>]  ps = 0000
Anyone venture a guess? The patch log does not seem to show specific
mentions of mm fixups from ac15 to 19
