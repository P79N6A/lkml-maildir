Hmm, I think adding a s-o-b line for David here isn't quite correct.
When someone reviews a patch and gives a suggestion, you only need to
copy him on the next iteration (and he may ack it or whatever, if he
wants) -- but adding a s-o-b line like that ends up (incorrectly)
denoting that he came between the author-to-git-commit chain ...

Please use %zu and lose all the ugly (unsigned long) casts here.
Otherwise it looks good,
