Completely disagree.  Write the most straightforward code possible,
and then if there proves to be a problem, optimize.  Optimizations
where there's no actual performance problem should be left to the
compiler.
Case in point: gcc-3.2 on -O2 on Intel is one instruction longer for
your version.
Hope that helps,
Rusty.
