Patch is in CVS.
Not 100% sure about the correct return code, if the lazy allocation
fails.  Can you check that?
Matsunaga, I guess that the extra memory you now have on your machine
has more impact on performance than statical allocation would have.
Translate the saved memory into a monetary unit and you even have a
lart that works for managers.
