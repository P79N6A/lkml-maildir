Subject: bogus IDE disk geometry, what to do?

I know this came up recently, so apologies for the question. Just what
should I do (LILO and fdisk) with this disk (IBM "8.4"Gb) to ensure
maximum future and other OS compatibility?
I have set this oldish BIOS to "auto". These are CHS values reported
by default, using kernel 2.2.9 and hdparm 3.5:
kernel 			1027/255/63
(kernel 2.0.36		1024/255/63)
hdparm -I (raw)
CurCHS			16383/16/63
LBA CHS			1023/256/63
CurSects		16514064
LBAsects                16514064
hdparm -i (cooked)
CurCHS			1027/255/63
LBA CHS			 513/510/63
CurSects		16514064
LBAsects		16514064
1024*255*63 = 16450560
 513*510*63 = 16482690
1027*255*63 = 16498755
1023*256*63 = 16498944
16383*16*63 = 16514064
It would _seem_ that all the dividing down that hdparm does is a bit
bogus when applied to odd numbers, as it results in the loss of the
end of the disk.
The drives work fine when forced to 16383,16,63. This is also the CHS
given by IBM in the datasheet (though they say, "as reported by the
XYZ command") and the number of sectors also matches that. Going for
16384*16*63 gives seek errors, so that's too big.
Thanks for any reply,
Giuliano Procida.
