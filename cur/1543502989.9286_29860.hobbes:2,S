Looks like we got a simple, old and standard way to "share priviledges" for 
file descriptors.  Thanx for the help.  
Now... anyone have ideas on how to convince the scheduler to prefer certain
context switches (i.e. between tightly-coupled server-client pairs)?  I 
know we were discussing latency recently.  Latency seems to be, itself, the 
one big drawback of the server-client model.
