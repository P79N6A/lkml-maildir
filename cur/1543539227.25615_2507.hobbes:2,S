I don't think this is what happened.  What priority is the main at?  I
think it got locked out by your thread 1 and did not even create thread
2 until thread 1 exited.

I am not sure what you want here, but SCHED_RR slices within a given
priority level.  A priority 5 thread will not be SCHED_RRed out in favor
of a priority 4 thread _EVER_.  See man pages on this.
Yes there are problem with the scheduler, but I don't think you have hit
them, yet :)

ps, there is a real time scheduler with some sample programs at
