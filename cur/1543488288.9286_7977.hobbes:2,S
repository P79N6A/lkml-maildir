	OK, that makes sense. Actually I would do the following: have a
sysctl-controllable amount of slack. That is, add atomic_t
pending_dead_SYNs initialized to 0, increase it each time we are
closing the connecting end of not-yet-accepted connection and decrease
each time we return such beast on accept(). Now, do
sleep_on_interruptible() only if pending_dead_SYNs is greater than
dead_SYN_slack.
	Check for not-yet-accepted being
unix_peer(sk) && !unix_peer(sk)->dead && !unix_peer(sk)->socket
from the connecting side and unix_peer(skb->sk)->dead on the accepting
one.

Sounds fine. In your variant: "connect() exceeding the the backlog limit
on listening socket blocks". I propose the following addition "... if the
system-wide limit on closed pending connects is also exceeded". It still
gives the syn-flood protection, but it gives more graceful behaviour.
