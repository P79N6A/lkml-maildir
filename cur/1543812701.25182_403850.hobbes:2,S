The comment you mention is very old, and no longer applies.
Get full packet traces from the kernel TSO code in the 2.6.x
kernel, analyze is, and post here what you think is occuring
that is causing the performance problems.
One thing to note is that the newer TSO code really needs to
have large socket buffers, so you can experiment with that.
