Urgh. I can't recall whether the nfs-server package has this
behaviour. Perhaps Olaf is listening?
Anyhow: to make myself more clear. The problem will occur if you have
the server exporting more than one disk in one export tree:
For example:
server /etc/fstab:
/dev/hda1:        /
/dev/hda2:        /usr
server /etc/exports:
/         client
client then mounts: / on /mnt
This can cause files on /mnt and /mnt/usr to have the same inode
number...
Cheers,
  Trond
