I don't think drivers/ide ever really played well when built modular, at 
least not in 2.4, quite possibly in 2.6 as well. Things like DMA not 
getting turned on automatically when the low-level driver was a module, 
etc. Likely why Red Hat/Fedora never built it modular when they did 
everything else..
