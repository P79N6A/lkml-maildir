Subject: [RFC][PATCH] SI_ASYNCIO: should be a kernel signal ?
SI_ASYNCIO is currently defined as -4 in the kernel. This makes it appear
like a "user" signal (i.e SI_FROMUSER() is true). SI_ASYNCIO is generated
by the kernel for async events like SI_MESGQ and SI_POLL, but unlike
SI_ASYNCIO, SI_MESGQ and SI_POLL are "kernel" signals (i.e SI_FROMKERNEL()
is true).
Shouldn't SI_ASYNCIO be a "kernel" signal too ? It is currently generated
from USB core code.
This quick/untested RFC patch changes the in-kernel value of SI_ASYNCIO
as follows so that it becomes a "kernel" signal.
	(7 << 16)|(-4 & 0xffff) = 0x7fffc which is SI_FROMKERNEL().
The user-space value of SI_ASYNCIO continues to be -4.
Known side-effects:
	Is this required to be SI_FROMUSER() to enable the uid checks in
	kill_pid_info_as_uid() ? Also, changing to "kernel" signal would skip
	the permission checks in check_kill_permission().  Would that be a
	problem ?
Why bother now ? (Sigh. Condensed long story)
	Besides the consistency with SI_POLL and SI_MESGQ this could simplify
	implementation of special signal semantics for container-init.  When a
	signal is sent to container-init from user-space, we need to check the
	pid namespace of the sender in send_signal(). But since send_signal()
	can also be called from interrupt context,  we have no way of knowing
	if it is safe to check the pid namespace of the caller.
	If SI_ASYNCIO signal appears as a kernel signal, we could possibly use
	SI_FROMUSER() to check if it safe to reference the pid namespace of
	the sender.
	If this change has no other side-effects/breakage we will explore this
	path further for the signal semantics for container-init. (There could
	be other hurdles along the way...) 
	See also 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/12/20/183
Appreciate any comments on this.
TODO:
	If this makes sense, make corresponding change to the SI_ASYNCIO
	in arch/mips/siginfo.h.
	SI_DETHREAD and SI_SIGIO are currently unused in the kernel. Should
	we similarly make them "kernel" signals too ?
