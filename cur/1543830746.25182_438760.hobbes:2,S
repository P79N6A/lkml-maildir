Exactly.  4105 > 256.  Such devices need a different format filehandle
which didn't work until very recently due to a bug (obviously no-one
tried it until recently).
The patch below fixes the kernel so that this will work.
Alternately use md_d0 md_d1, md_d2, or md_d3.  Then it will work with
no patches.

Fixing missing 'expkey' support for fsid type 3
From: Frank Filz <ffilzlnx@us.ibm.com>
Type '3' is used for the fsid in filehandles when the device number
of the device holding the filesystem has more than 8 bits in either
major or minor.
Unfortunately expkey_parse doesn't recognise type 3.  Fix this.
