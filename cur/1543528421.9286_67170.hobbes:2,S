I wouldn't be so sure: this case depends largely on the network cards'
ability to quickly send off any request you put in the buffer. My
experience is that even a 100Mbit card can quickly build up a backlog
in the case of bulk transfers (which presumably is why people have
developed Gigabit cards). This turned out to be a major problem when
developing the write-gathering server optimized NFS client even on a
(by modern standards) slow PPro 180MHz.
Of course the robustness of the card's driver is also important, and
this often contributes to the problem (cf. the eepro100 driver under
linux-2.3.x where x < 40ish).
Cheers,
