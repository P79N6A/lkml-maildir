#endif can have white space before '#' and between '#' and 'endif', it
can have tabs instead of spaces, the spurious text is anything that
does not start with '/'.  Time to start a new one liner contest ;) ...
find -type f -name '*.[chS]' | xargs perl -lpi -e 's:^(\s*#\s*endif)\s+([^/\s].*)$:\1\t/* \2 */:;'
It even preserves the existing #endif layout.  That regexp does not
catch #endif /foo, it assumes that '/' always starts a comment.  The
extra complexity to catch that rare case is not worth it.  The command
changed 97 files on base 2.4.0.
