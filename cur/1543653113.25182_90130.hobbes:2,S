"after exec()" == "in the initialization code for the exec'ed program"?

Yes.

Using two pointers would allow to provide all the functionality
mentioned in the discussion on your first clone/tid patch

Calling sys_set_tid_address after fork is equivalent (but non-atomic)
but requires an additional system call.

Debugging tools already need to be aware of this for process
initialization, so this shouldn't be a serious problem.
