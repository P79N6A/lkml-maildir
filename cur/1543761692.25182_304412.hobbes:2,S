The RT patch uses the lock ordering "in place" and whatevery nasty
situation was going on previously will be effectively under high load,
which increases the chance of it being triggered. Removal of the read
side semantic just increases load more so that those cases can trigger.
I disagree with this approach and I have an alternate implementation
here that restores it. It's only half tested and fairly meaningless
until an extreme contention case is revealed with the current rt lock
implementation. Numbers need to be gather to prove or disprove this
conjecture.

Excuse me, ...would *not* have that circularity.
