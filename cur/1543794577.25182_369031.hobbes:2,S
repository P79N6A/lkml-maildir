Yes, the hdparm -y, -Y, and -S flags all work with the passthru feature set,
which is included in the 2.6.15-rc* kernels.
Typical power consumption figures, from WDC SataII drives:
Idle:  430mA@12VDC + 730mA@5VDC (about 8.75 watts)
Standby:  20mA@12VDC + 270mA@5VDC (about 1.60 watts)
Sleep: 20mA@12VDC + 250mA@5VDC (about 1.50 watts)
Those are from the WDC datasheets.
Cheers
