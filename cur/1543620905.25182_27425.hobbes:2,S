luckily, someone wrote such a kernel module - syscalltrack,
http://syscalltrack.sf.net
.
it's in alpha stages right now, but it seems pretty stable so far (It
Works For Me - i run it regularly on all of my machines). note that we
currently support only logging system calls (a-la strace) and failing
them with a user given parameter- rewriting system call parameters will
require additional hackery, but not too much of it - on the order of one
day of work. volunteers are welcome.
