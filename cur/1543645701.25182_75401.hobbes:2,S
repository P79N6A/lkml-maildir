Yup, this is the big problem with VM ;)

FreeBSD fixes this in a fairly simple way.  It has a sysctl
switch (vm_defer_pageouts IIRC) that can be toggled on and
off.
If the switch is off, the VM only reclaims swap backed pages
if memory is really low and doesn't if it can keep enough
free memory by only reclaiming file backed pages.
