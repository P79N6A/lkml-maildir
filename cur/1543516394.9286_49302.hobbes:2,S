I'm in favor of that too.
In addition (small by comparison) - large Linux systems also need a way
to control resources and perform project level accounting.
1. Resources need to be tracked better to provide more DoS "accidents" that
   can abort processes. (ref the out-of-memory problem discussed earlier)
2. On a system that may have 100 users running long term jobs (1-2 days,
   10-100 processors per job, on SGI Origin level systems), accounting for
   usage becomes important.
   There have been large demands for file access control (ie group level access)
   without giving away accounting chargeback control. ACLs help with this
   but are not a complete answer (individual users must then administer 
   the ACLs).
