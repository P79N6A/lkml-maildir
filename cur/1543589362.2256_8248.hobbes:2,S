Try: dmesg | grep -i aic7xxx
Some distributions store the boot dmesg output in a file, since if the
kernel spews a lot of messages, the older ones get lost if the buffer is
full; SuSE e. g. have been using /var/log/boot.msg for quite some time
now.
Other systems throw the entire boot message output into the normal
syslog.  (Seen than one on FreeBSD 4.3, but I don't remember Debian 1.x
and Red Hat 6.0 Sparc.)
