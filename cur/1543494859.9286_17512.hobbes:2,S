Hmm, a couple stupid questions:  [If we went with Andrea's approach]
(1) For the case of common code, shouldn't the wrapper be migrate out into
the non-common region?
(2) Couldn't something be done to >occasionally< detect this potential lockup,
and occasionally issue warnings?  [So, yeah, it will lock up, but somebody is
gonna see the warnings.]
