	I have seen exactly this same behavior using Netatalk with the
Intel EEPro netcard.  According to the Netatalk docs, the EEPro doesn't
handle multicast properly.  Does IPv6 use use multicast?
From the Netatalk README.ASUN:
problems with appletalk: 
        certain ethernet card/drivers don't deal well with the fact
        that appletalk aggressively uses hardware multicast. here are
        a few ones that may cause problems:
            ne2000 clones
            3Com501 cards (maybe others)
            intel etherexpress/pro 
              set multicast_filter_limit=3 in linux if you're having
              problems with this card. to do that, add the following
              line to /etc/conf.modules: 
                 options eepro100 multicast_filter_limit=3
