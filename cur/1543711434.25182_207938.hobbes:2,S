Jens, am I right that you didn't do any changes/cleanups I asked you to do?
Here they are once again (probably some new items added as a bonus). ;-)
- do not use hwgroup->wrq (die!) and do not add drive->special_buf,
  just do what PM code does and other special commands do - use taskfile
  (yes, dirty stack allocation)
- SCSI -> IDE transform should die, please use something like REQ_FLUSH
  and let subsystems deal with it
- ide_get_error_location() is cool but clean other places doing same thing
  as you are duplicating existing code
  (please use u64 not sector_t - you are getting raw info from the disk)
- why does blkdev_issue_flush() add REQ_BLOCK_PC to rq->flags?
- why are we doing pre-flush?

The fact that spec says "supported" not "enabled" in description of word86
makes me wonder - can they be disabled? (FLUSH CACHE is mandatory for General
feature set and FLUSH CACHE EXT is mandatory if 48-bit LBA is supported)
Jeff, please note that these bits were introduced by ATA-6 spec
and take a look at ATA-5 spec:
...
FLUSH CACHE
General feature set
- Mandatory for all devices
...
and ATA-4 spec:
...
FLUSH CACHE
General feature set
- Optional for all devices
...
IMO to test if FLUSH CACHE works we should just issue it during disk setup
and check result.  This way we can use FLUSH CACHE also on < ATA-6 devices
(there is a lot of them).
Cheers,
Bartlomiej
