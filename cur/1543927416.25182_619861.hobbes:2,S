Yeah, I saw only one loop in there and so I think this covers it. The 
debug code that I added to the cpu alloc patches did not throw any warning 
and bugs anymore. So I am sure that this does not occur on the 
configurations where I tested it. If some is running with the latest cpu 
area patches then he will get bugs() for accessing an impossible 
processors cpu area and warnings for accessing an offline processors cpu 
area.
