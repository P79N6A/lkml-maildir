Unfortunately no. To much chaos in that period:
I think I incurred into two or three different kernel bugs
(and a Debian keyboard bug) in one or two days. Usually
I find such important bugs only few times per year,
and never together).
I tried also git-bisect, but too much runs, to many non-compiling
commits, bad environment (the Debian bug) and the quick fix of the
kernel bug ;-) stopped me in further searching.
