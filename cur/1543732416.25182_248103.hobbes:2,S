Well, they clearly can't, since it depends on the filesystem. Also, 
transactions have a tendency to be expensive, and people have a tendency 
to ask for more than you give them. Doing transactions on one file is 
only the beginning - you'll find people who want transactions across file 
boundaries etc.
That's a basic fact when it comes to pretty much anything: you can always 
find people who want something better. You can't be all things to all 
people, so what you actually _want_ to do is to expose the _minimal_ set 
of capabilities that people can build on.
So I definitely don't want this discussion to degenerate (any more than it
lng since has ;) into what people _wish_ for. No, it should be a "what is
the _least_ we can absolutely do" that solves real problems.
