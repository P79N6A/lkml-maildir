Ah, thanks for pointing that out. Unfortunately this fact isn't made clear in 
the timer_create page and the exec page isn't very understandable for 
non-native speakers and non-lawyers. ;-)
But after reading the parts you mentioned (expecially the [XSI] and [TMR] 
acronyms), I have to agree with you, the patch is wrong and so is the test 
case I mentioned.
However, poking around in the kernel was fun anyway. ;-)
