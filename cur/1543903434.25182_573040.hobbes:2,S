Hi all!
[please CC me]
I think, for this time is te good, for starting the 2.7-tree. I know,
thet is the old question, but has everything in his favour:
 * arch unifie (i386 + x86_84 -> x86)
 * new virtualisation technik (xen, kvm, lguest)
 * new FS (ext4, reiser4)
 * new cpu-scheduler (CFS)
 * soo many patch in -mm tree
 * subsystem modifications
thanks
Oliver
