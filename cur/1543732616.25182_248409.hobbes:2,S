hey, i recently discovered that my kernel completely crashed when
accessing my vfat partitions under 2.6.8.1-mm2+, somtimes it worked, and
then suddenly it will just freeze, and i have to hard reset.. its quite
strange, the files worked, but it would some time crash...
when booting windows, it scandisked, and said it converted dirs to
files, and then there were just 32kb files instead of a dir with 7gb..
any idea why this happens?
