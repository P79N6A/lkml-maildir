Christoph,
   I've been hitting an intermittent null pointer dereference ever
since I've made this change:
BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000038

The problem is that make_socks is occasionally getting called with a
NULL nlmsvc_serv pointer. I think the problem occurs here in lockd_up().
        if (nlmsvc_task) {
                if (proto)
                        error = make_socks(nlmsvc_serv, proto);
                goto out;
        }
You pointed out earlier that this should really be checking that
nlmsvc_serv is non-NULL. I can and will make this change, and that will
likely fix this particular oops, but the fact that I'm hitting it here
suggests that kthread_run is returning before lockd has a chance
to set nlmsvc_serv. It shouldn't be according to your statement above.
Are you sure that kthread_run is working correctly? It seems like it
might not be doing the right thing here...
