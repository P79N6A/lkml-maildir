It probably doesn't. People will want to apply my patch
(on 
http://www.surriel.com/patches/
) to -test9-pre8 to
see if that really makes the box solid.
Testing volunteers: it looks like you have one whole day
to really stress-test the crap out of my patch so Linus
can have a bit of certainty the patch he'll (maybe) apply
really works ;)
