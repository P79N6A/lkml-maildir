Ok, first, if I told you I've used three different drives and got
the same error, how would it matter what the current hd specs are?
kernel is a stock 2.0.35 kernel from rh 5.1.
I'm assuming this error MEANS something and isn't reliant on
a specific manufacturer, but to satisfy everyone who may be
asking the same questions:
brand is a 6.4gig Quantum Fireball SE.
The interface is scsi, but it's happened on many ide drives as well.
The other drives were Quantums as well.  If there is a problem with
quantum drives and linux, that would be swell, but I need to know.
Thanks
