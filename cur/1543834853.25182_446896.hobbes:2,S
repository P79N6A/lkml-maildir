I agree.
However, almost all distros now use persistant names for network devices
due to the PCI Hotplug issue, so it isn't probably as bad as you might

Oh yeah, it will be probably both of them :)

But now that we all are using /dev/disk/ and it has persistant device
names for block devices, I really don't think it's that big of a deal.
