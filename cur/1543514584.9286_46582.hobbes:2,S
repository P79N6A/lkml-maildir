It's not really 'obvious'.  But it is more robust, yes.  Presumably you
now get EPP mode detected, where previously you didn't?

Ho ho.
I can't remember why it is that the 'Intel bug' that we check for is so
bad that it means we can't use EPP.  David Campbell did tell me once (it's
his code that appears there, adapted from an earlier version of ppa.c),
but I can't think of it now.
In any case, it may be that things now work better for you, but for other
people (specifically those whose chipsets have the 'Intel bug')
performance may get worse.
I would rather leave that code alone in 2.2 until it's had a good chance
to be tested out properly in 2.3.
Tim.
