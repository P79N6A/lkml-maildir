Do you really think it's acceptable?  With your patch, you couldn't
SIGKILL or SIGCONT a task that happens to be ptraced.  I certainly
would expect to be able to do this for a task that is being strace'd,
for example.
Also, other signals will still wake up the task.  Yes, it won't get
very far as do_signal() will notify the parent instead, but still, the
task will run and that could be enough to create some race condition.
What about the other wakeup paths that I had mentioned?  E.g., what if
the ptraced task is ptracing another task?  Couldn't notify_parent()
end up waking up the task as well?

Ah, that's a good point, thanks.  Nothing that can't be fixed, though.

Yes, I missed that.
