Eric,
Today I upgraded a few routers running 2.6.11.6 to the
same 2.6.17.8 kernel and experienced the same issues. 
It only happens on the boxes with the NatSemi card.
Attached you will find a diff between the natsemi.c
driver from 2.6.11.6 and 2.6.17.8.  Perhaps you'll see
where the problem exists (I don't understand C code).
Thanks
