Thanks for the patch! Sorry for the very late response.  I just
discovered this while cleaning up my mailbox :)

Considering the simplicity of sha1.c, I'd say that you should just
duplicate it.

I think the best solution is to replace SHA_WORKSPACE_WORDS with an
inline function/macro that returns zero for the optimised version.
