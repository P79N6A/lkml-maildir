does this approach allow one to add directories to the union and have it 
behave normally.  namely when imagine one has the situation
dir-b
dir-a/ (contains file foo)
if one unions this and deletes foo, that will create a whiteout entry in 
dir-a
now, what happens if one does
dir-c
dir-b (now contains whiteout, from previous union).
dir-a (contains file foo)
will one see foo or not. i.e. are whiteouts only looked for in the 
topmost dir, or in every dir?
