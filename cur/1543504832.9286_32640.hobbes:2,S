I was just browsing some recent issues of Phrack and noticed a developing
fascination therein with the potential vulnerabilities of modular kernels,
which I would not be concerned much about if I were able to sucessfully 
compile a completely non modular kernel. Which i can't- something always 
craps out, but works OK in modular form. And, no modules seems to mean no 
compression for slip/ppp,no encryption, etc. etc.
Since the cracker/hacker community is actively drooling over this route
to undermining security, isn't the time ripe to add some superior facilities 
to control kernel-module loading and authenticate modules ?
As a first approach I was thinking generically of a matched set of kernel
and modules, that recognize and work with only each other. 
Since the only cryptographic process here would be signing, I don't think 
this would impact kernel distribution.
Naturally, there are other issues with modules that need to be 
addressed....better to do so now before tools begin to appear.
