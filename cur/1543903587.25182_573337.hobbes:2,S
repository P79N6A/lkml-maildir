It should be trivial enough to have sysfs_create_blah() do enough
initializations before it can fail so that sysfs_remove_blah() do the
right thing regardless.
It's actually a major PITA for a driver that creates a whole bunch of
sysfs files to have to track precisely which ones were created
successfully for the error path. If it's a single function, goto does
the trick but if for some reason it's not, it's really annoying.
