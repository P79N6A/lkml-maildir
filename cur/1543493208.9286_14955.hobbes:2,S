	You don't need *anything* special for that. You don't need
capabilities - file descriptor of the directory will work just fine. Let
the daemon pass it to applications via SCM_RIGHTS (after proper
authentication, indeed) and call fchdir() in the application. Make the
directory inaccessible to anybody except the daemon (no exec for group
and world on parent) and there you go. You'll need to protect the thing
from reaching it via /proc/* - not a big deal.
