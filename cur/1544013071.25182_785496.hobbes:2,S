Um, but we got told to use all these weak functions instead of the
ARCH_HAS... defines.  They certainly litter the x86 boot code.  The
standard pattern was to put the weak function in the file where it was
used, which is what you're now saying will miscompile.
Which gcc versions are the problem?  Because it's going to be a bit
painful catching and killing all the problems ... it might be better
just to patch the master kernel makefile to refuse to build with the
offending gcc versions.
