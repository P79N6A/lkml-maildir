That's fine with me - eventually it would even be worth adding a
printk() as reminder on code path for "scan" and "delete_devices"
triggered when there exists an active user of the bus/device being
probed.
This way there is at least a notice in case something goes wrong (and
when the locking is fixed a reminder to adjust the documentation)
