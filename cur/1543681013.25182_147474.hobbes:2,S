In case when suspending (and interrupting suspend) matters most - 
laptops - Joe random user is the only user present. I myself would
rather have an option to press ESC than remember what SysRq really 
maps to as by the time I would figure that out the laptop would already
be suspended.
IMHO, an option to use ESC, probably compile time option, is a good 
thing.
