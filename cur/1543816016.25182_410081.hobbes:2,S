&& MPSC is wrong. First most kernels are GENERIC and then even a K8 optimized

If it does isolation then it has much more advantages than that
by protecting against buggy devices and drivers and is also useful
for debugging. You should mention that.

This is weird. Normally I would expect you to detect the calgary thing first
and only then run the gart_iommu detection if not found. Why this order?
Fixing that would also not require adding the additional hacks to gart iommu
you added.

So where is it called now?

Why does this need to be an early option?
