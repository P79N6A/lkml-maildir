It's a tiny driver and it hardy can be a part of the mainline kernel 
because of its useless for everyone but me, beside I don't want to make 
someone modify the kernel code. For example, I've written this driver, 
than someone who wanna use it takes the code and tries to deal with it 
and he finds out that he also needs to have the latest kernel (where the 
device is included to that black list) or to fix the kernel himself. 
It's rather uncomfortable for a person who just wants to use a simple 
device with a simple driver, isn't it? It'll be great if my driver can 
manage it himself.

As far as I remember this driver modifies the HID driver... it's what I 
was talking about late.
