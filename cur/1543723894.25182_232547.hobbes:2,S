Just like to chime in as a tester. I've been running the orinoco CVS
for around 6 weeks now. Has been very stable although I needed the
attached patch to make suspend/resume work (thinkpad with APM).
I posted a bug on orinoco savannah but haven't seen any changes in CVS.
BTW - what is the *correct* ordering of pci_(save|restore)_state,
pci_set_power_state?
The new scanning functionality is great. Thanks guys for the good work.
