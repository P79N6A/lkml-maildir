You worry about /dev over nfs, with the server booting in the middle of
such a comparison?  This can work even with randomized device numbers,
just don't let that nfs server populate the exported /dev itself.
Let the client(s) run udev, and have one /dev for each on persistent 
storage.  If the nfs server reboots it simply keeps serving /dev's
in whatever shape the clients set them up with.
