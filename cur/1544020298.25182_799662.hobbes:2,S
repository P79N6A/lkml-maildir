The structures have been defined exactly like that in XFS (and ocfs2)
before, and there are similar cases in other ioctls handlers.
If anyone feels like changing this in some way feel free to wade through
the endless discussions about the pros and cons for it, but I think
doing it in context of this patch is not helpful.
