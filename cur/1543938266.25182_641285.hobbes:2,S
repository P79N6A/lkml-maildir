This is a common problem with running 32-bit kernels with more than 8Gb RAM.
(Search the archives and you will find similar problem reports.)
Anyone in your situation has two options - Preferred one is to switch
to a 64-bit kernel. In most cases you can just upgrade the kernel to
64-bits and use the same 32-bit userspace. It works fine.
If you cannot for some reason upgrade to a 64-bit kernel, the second
option is to try and use RHEL/CentOS kernels which according to Alan
Cox are better tuned for this kind of setup and you have a better
chance that they will work.
