I've still some bug report of people using home-compiled devfs kernels
on Debian. So people still use it. You say "devfs" is buggy, but
it works on nearly all cases, so people tend not to switch.
The worse is the lack of stable name of devices, in udev too.
I.e. microcode loader (Intel CPU) needs a device, which was so
named (last time I controlled):
   # device name in LANANA / devices.txt
   DEVICE=/dev/cpu/microcode
   # device name in devfsd
   DEVICE2=/dev/misc/microcode
   # device name in udev
   DEVICE3=/dev/microcode
If we a coherent *default* device name scheme, the switching
from a kernel utility to other would be trivial.

Note: /dev/cpu/microcode was also created by devfs until
recent 2.4 kernels and the whole 2.6 serie.
