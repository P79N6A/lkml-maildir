I can see where the testing for algorithmic correctness would be useful.
The final code should reflect the final choices.

Correct - snprintf will not nul terminate if it runs out of buffer.
But then again, I wouldn't expect a "mask_snprintf" (such as might wrap
this __mask_snprintf_len() code) to guarantee nul termination in the
full buffer case either.  Rather the caller has to watch for a returned
length that is too close to the length of the buffer, and handle it as
an error.  If you look at the cpumask_snprintf() calls, they do just
this.
snprintf-like calls should behave like snprintf calls, no fancier.

We'll see.  I'm still poking at it.
