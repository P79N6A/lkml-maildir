Up to now, the unmodified kvm module never worked with any RT kernel. 
This would only change, if RT patched kernels were routinely used in the 
kvm release tests which is, for the time being, not the case.
However, tglx once provided a hand-crafted kvm version that can be used 
together with a selected RT kernel -> see "Latest Stable" 
(
http://www.osadl.org/Latest-Stable.latest-stable-realtime-kernel.0.html
) 
realtime kernel. It is based on kernel 2.6.21.6-rt21 and kvm-28.
We used these modules to carry out a number of "proof of concept" tests 
which were very successful. The realtime capabilities of the host system 
remained unchanged irrespective of whether the kvm guest system (no 
graphics) was running or not. This was even the case while the guest 
system was booting.
We are planning to provide another "Latest Stable" realtime kernel 
within the next month or so. It will probably be based on kernel 2.6.23.
