By a coincident, I saw a discussion about a change in the VFS
interface. Why is this discussed on linux-kernel? Why not the fsdevel
list?
It is quite impossible for me to read the whole linux-kernel mailing
list, because of the extreme volume.
Please, please, please, don't make life harder than it is for an fs
developer. Is it some kind of sport keeping everything on one mailing
list?
Could someone at least announce vfs changes on the fsdevel list?
