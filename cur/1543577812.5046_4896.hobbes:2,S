        This is what I get for trying this at 4am in the morning! *g*
        This isn't happening to acpi_ksyms.c, but actually 
drivers/acpi/ksyms.c (the assume -R bit, I mean). I still get the above error 
with. I'm still seeing 
#include <linuxpi.h>
        at line 25 of acpi_ksyms.c. This is also the same line, in 
patch-2.4.0-ac2 (counted the lines of each). Neither patches compile from this.
I've gone through the -ac2 patch, and there's only 2 places where <linuxpi.h> 
is located: added to the newly-created acpi_ksyms.c from the patch, and being 
backed out of drivers/acpi/ksyms.c. Other than that, there is no mention of it 
in the source. Only saying no to CONFIG_ACPI gets around it.
                                                        BL.
