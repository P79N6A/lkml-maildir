Not "any". Only writable shared mmap. Which is actually the rare case.
Even then, we might want to have such processes have a way to say "I don't 
do futexes in this mmap" or similar. Quite often, writable shared mmaps 
aren't interested in locked cycles - they are there to just write things 
to disk, and all the serialization is done in the kernel when the user 
does a "munmap()" or a "msync()".
