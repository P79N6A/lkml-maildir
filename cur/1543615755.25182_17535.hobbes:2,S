No.  If the only goal was to avoid a diagnostic, the it could be
undefined.  The fact that it is implementation defined means that it's
reasonable to expect it to be useful for something.

Whether C is a "low-level" or "high-level" language (whatever that
means) is not the issue here.  The issue here is that, as you say, quite a
few implementations of C provide the ability to access arbitrary memory
through pointers, and the standard provides some convenient places for the
implementation to do it, and many users of GCC would really like to have
this feature.
Forgive me if I haven't been reading the manual carefully enough.  Now can
we please get a straight answer to the question:  Does GCC provide the
ability to turn an arbitrary address into a pointer, and if so how do you
do it?
