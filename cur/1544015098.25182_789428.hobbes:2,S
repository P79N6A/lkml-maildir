No, "both" didn't get moved. "hwxface.c" is a totally new file when you 
look at the big picture. Yes, it got moved in one commit, but if you look 
at the whole history, the _history_ is actually:
 - Move public interfaces from hwregs.c to new file, hwxface.c
 - rename hwxface.c to another directory
and so git - for the merge statistics - ends up showing this as
>  .../acpi/{hardware/hwregs.c => acpica/hwxface.c}   |  744 +++++++-------------
which is actually correct.
Of course, it would _also_ have been correct to show it as the 
"{hardware/hwregs.c => acpica/hwregs.c}" move that you apparently 
expected, but what git did was just a more interesting thing.
So my point is that the "movement history" is actually different in a 
small view than it is in a big one. If you do "git log -C --stat", you'll 
see the output you expect at each point:

	    ACPICA: create acpica/ directory
	
	 drivers/acpi/{hardware => acpica}/hwregs.c     |    0
but when taken all-together, git decided that the bulk of the data (even 
if not the _lines_) actally moved from
	drivers/acpi/{hardware/hwregs.c => acpica/hwxface.c}
which is thus what git shows for the merge diff (which is taken over the 
whole history).
As usual, git is actually smarter and get things more correct than people 
realize. What you found "surprising" is actually a "profound truth". 
Git is like a great indian mystic. It sees past the veil of the trivial, 
to find the true connections in life.
Or at least in source code.
