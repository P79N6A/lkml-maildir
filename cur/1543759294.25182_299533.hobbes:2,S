The solution I ended up going with was the original CRLF suggestion, and
then I pass around a group of environment vars in userspace rather than
a single line. This works as before, but works with commas and isn't as
ugly as I had thought it might be.
As far as the modules.aliases file goes, I'm not sure what our options
are there. Is the only requirement that the aliases be consistent in the
kernel and in userspace? Since aliases for OF devices haven't previously
existed, I defined the format. Is there any reason I couldn't define the
format such that whitepsace is replaced by underscores, thus eliminating
this issue?
