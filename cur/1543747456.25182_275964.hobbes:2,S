i've attached the particular trace from Rui's collection of traces which
nicely shows the ACPI race in action. Here are the relevant events:
 swapper-0     08000000 0.840ms (+0.000ms): preempt_schedule (cpu_idle)
 swapper-0     ........ 0.913ms (+0.000ms): ->    IRQ 5-3052 [ 0000001d 0000008c ]: wake_up_process
 swapper-0     08000001 0.913ms (+0.920ms): acpi_processor_idle (cpu_idle)
 swapper-0     ........ 1.834ms (+0.000ms): common_interrupt:  [ e0022266 00000000 00000000 ]
 swapper-0     88010001 1.834ms (+0.000ms): direct_timer_interrupt (do_IRQ)
   IRQ 5-3052  80000002 1.848ms (+0.000ms): __switch_to (__sched_text_start)
i.e. at timestamp 0.840ms cpu_idle() got preempted (it was after the
need_resched() check but before the rcu_read_lock() which disables
preemption), then at 0.913ms a task was woken up by the hardirq context,
but despite this we called into acpi_processor_idle() which slept
dutifully until the next timer interrupt hit us. Then did only the woken
up task schedule. (which caused an xrun in Rui's setup.)
