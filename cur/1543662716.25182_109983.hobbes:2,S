The big thing here is actually turning 
'Your bios sucks'
into
'Your bios sucks, but we fixed it and life is good, don't panic'
Which with a vendor hat on is important. Its currently hard to tell whether
some Linux errors are things to worry about or merely spanking the
manufacturer. I'd urge people writing error messages to think about that btw
- does it tell the user if the problem is fixed ?
