Ok...  So if we could offer the 'real' exclusion that the PBS and LSF
workload managers offer directly, would that suffice?  Meaning, could we
make PBS and LSF work on top of in-kernel mechanisms that offer 'real'
exclusion.  'Real' exclusion defined as isolated groups of CPUs and
memory that the kernel can guarantee will not run other processes?  That
way we can get the job done without having to rely on these external
workload managers, and be able to offer this dynamic partitioning to all
users.  Thoughts?
