It seems that the change Christoph introduced (from Red Hat's tree) in the
lines around 810 (line number in -rc3) in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c didn't
consider the case that someone want's to _in_crease the size of the memory
by using the "mem="  parameter.
It's the following Changeset:

   ChangeSet@1.383.2.25  2002-04-15 23:18:40-03:00  hch@infradead.org
   all diffs
   [PATCH] mem= command lines fixes.
   Another patch from Red Hat's tree:
     mem= command-line adapts itself to existing e820 values.
     without this patch mem=xxxM ignores bios-reserved areas and uses
     them as RAM. This patch makes the kernel skip these areas
