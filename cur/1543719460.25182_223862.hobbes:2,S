If he was  raw mode from a  USB keyboard, he should get  the raw data.
Of course, he should know what he's doing.

What application should be looking at  the raw data from an RS232 port
outside the kernel and why?
Why do you  leave 'efax' in userspace, letting  it read/write raw data
to/from the modem via the RS232?

In a nutshell, I hate to be restricted by YOUR own imaginations of how
people should hack  the system.
Raw keyboard  data, for  instance, can be  captured for  analyzing how
people use the  keyboard and coming up with  a more efficient keyboard
layout (c.f. Dvorak).  That's already beyond your imaginations.
