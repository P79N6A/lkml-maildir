I'm not talking about a simple find, ... the two "make MAKE='make -j10'"
in /usr/src/linux/ and /usr/src/newkernel/linux/ do force this
`break down' with 2.2.0-pre9 if the two makes are entering
/usr/src/linux/fs/ or /usr/src/newkernel/linux/fs/ respectively
at the same time which increases the load a `bit'.
