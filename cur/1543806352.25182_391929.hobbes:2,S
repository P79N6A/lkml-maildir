Yes, eric, that puts into words what I was trying to express.
Refactor all the MC drivers to utilize such a 'edac_printk()' helper
function, and add control mechanisms to that function for level of
output, etc. Then the begining format of the output stream can be
"tagged" as EDAC output, etc, for harvest patterns.
As to Dave Jones original, I remember that the "NON-FATAL" tag was still
indicating that some error was occuring, but it wasn't a "take the
machine down" type of event. But it was some problem.  Time to break out
the Intel Specs for that MC.
