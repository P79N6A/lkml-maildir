Hello,
I just installed the latest kernel: 2.4.0-test9pre4. I have also
installed the pcmcia-cs-3.1.20 package. I have a Compaq Armada 7400 with
128 MB RAM and a 4 GB disk running Mandrake 7.0. I want to report the
following malfunction. There is something bad between the PCI, the 3c59x
cardbus driver and the PCMCIA. When I use the 3CCFE575CT, I got the
following messages:
    Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.20
    options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]

When I use my 3CCE589ET, everything works fine. Any ideas ?
Thanks for the support,
Claude.
