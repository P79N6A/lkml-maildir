I see...sorry for not explaining myself: Isn't "testing" just an
alias for "unstable"?
I understand that an interface can be in a "testing" stage and at
the same time not be "unstable" (even if "testing" also means it
can change). But shouldn't all the interfaces in "testing" stage
be also "unstable" by default? Or they're just different degrees
of "unstability"? It's a bit confusing IMO
