Nack.  This is used for paravirt-ops kernels that use IOPL'd userspace.  
Fixing it would require a fairly heavy penalty on the iret path, since 
every single instruction there contributes to a critical region which 
must have custom fixup code, or some other technique to provide 
protection against interrupt re-entrancy.
At least, let's discuss other potential solutions first - for now it is 
harmless.
