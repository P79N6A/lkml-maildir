Well, something went wrong with the patch - it has extra negative signs
in my mail reader, and on lkml, but now that I've hit reply and it's
been quoted, it looks fine in my mail client.  So I have no idea what
went on.
However, I got around the problem by making the code change manually -
and my network connection is now working.  Looking at the code being
bypassed:
    if (pE.cap[i] || pP.cap[i] || pP.cap[i])
looks somewhat weird as it is testing the same condition twice.  Should
it have been:
    if (pE.cap[i] || pP.cap[i] || pI.cap[i])
?
I'm about to test that change instead of bypassing the loop, so I'll let
you know the results.
