Who cares what the thing is called.  It only has to be unique in the
whole kernel driver namespace, and it will be automatically loaded by
the tools when the device is plugged in, so it will never be typed in by
hand (except by developers, and they are used to looney names like
this.)
Oliver wrote it, so he gets to name it :)
