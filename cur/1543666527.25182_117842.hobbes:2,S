Rude in general - _assuming_ the writer is decent.
If someone ever send me a letter I consider rude or otherwise hostile enough
I will publish it in order to expose the writer as the bad guy he is.
That hasn't ever happened, but mail sent to me is mine - I can do with
it whatever I want.  Nobody should be able to harass via (e)mail and expect
that their victim will protect them by keeping their dirty little secret.
I certainly won't.
Wether such action is warranted in this case is another question though.
