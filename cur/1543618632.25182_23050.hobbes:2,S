Java lover's computer gcc -v says:
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.96/specs
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-98)
I realize that '\0' is a legit character.   And before you start,
I also realize that a string is a null terminated list of characters (yuck).
My point is to be clean about one's code.    For example, Mark
Hahn sent me a bit of C based strlen code, but I prefer the
Linux kernel implementation which is more explicit and doesn't
make funky implicit nor explicit casts.  Kernel code:
(And, of course, glibc uses Assembly for strlen).
#ifndef __HAVE_ARCH_STRLEN
/**
 * strlen - Find the length of a string
 * @s: The string to be sized
 */
size_t strlen(const char * s)
{
    const char *sc;
    for (sc = s; *sc != '\0'; ++sc)
        /* nothing */;
    return sc - s;
}
#endif
