Ok, I've finally found out what's happenning: in i8042_aux_write()
you restore the CTR value each time. For some obscure reasons, my
laptop's controller does not like this at all. Disabling this
section makes the mouse function perfectly.
Is this CTR restore command really needed ? If it is, we should
probably add an option like "i8042_noctrrestore=1" to the i8042
driver...
Or maybe you have a better idea...
Stelian.
