Hi All,
 I asked this on the debian-user list but was told to ask here. Now I've
looked through the archieves and can find a few threads similar but no
definite answers. My current config is as follows
NFS Server Debian Woody Stable + 2.6.2-bk1
NFS Client Debian Woody Stable + 2.6.1
If I mount the server as udp I get 0 response from the server and if I
mount as tcp I get about 8kb/s from the server. I've tried tweaking
rsizw/wsize and have got nothing. Can anyone suggest a fix + more info I
can provide? (tcpdump?)
Thanks
Rus
