Searching the mailing list I figured that as soons as the interface seems
to be stable, kvm should/would switch to a system call based interface.
I assume the userspace interface might still change a lot, especially if
kvm is ported to new architectures.
But the general question is: do you still plan to switch to a syscall
interface?
