1) how would this cause deadlocks?
2) how would this somehow be worse than the
   unconditional 'goto try_again' we had before?
This goto is ok because we have the OOM killer, which will select
a process to kill when we run out of memory. Also, the goto will
make sure that OTHER processes will survive while the "guilty"
process will be killed.
The guilty process will never get to the goto because it will
have PF_MEMALLOC set.

Rik
