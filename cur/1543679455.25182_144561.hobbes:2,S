In thinking about that...
I would suggest a "resource allocation daemon", where resource is defined
to be non-kernel objects - devices mostly... ptys /dev/tape unmounted disks
removable media, specific files (not sure how to explain this one though, but
controlling access to specified fifo's, memory mapped files? how about 
printer queues...)
Anything that gets defined as a system wide resource that users may access, 
but exist as external (to the kernel) objects. It would need some kind of 
kernel interface, but the access control would be defined outside the kernel.
The most the kernel would need is a "resource controlled by" and "resource 
allocated to" identification so that the appropriate daemon could be invoked
(I do see a possibility for multiple resource allocation daemons).
