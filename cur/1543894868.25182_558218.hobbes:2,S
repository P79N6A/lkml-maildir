ianal, but fortunately that's not what the law is. The license says what 
it says, and that is what controls. The intent of the author (of Linus 
and other copyright holders) is a secondary source of information /if 
and only if/ any ambiguity of meaning arises (as determined by a judge, 
not by you or me). But the opinion and intent of RMS (unless adopted by 
Linus) is quite immaterial.
( there is a legalistic special-case. If any dispute arises over
  what license the COPYING file in Linux itself (and only that file) is 
  under, then the intent of RMS matters too, but only for that limited
  matter for that single file. Btw., the COPYING file itself is not 
  licensed under the GPL. )
