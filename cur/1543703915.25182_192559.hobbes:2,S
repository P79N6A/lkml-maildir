Guess I don't understand your point. Do you want us to create separate 
functions for soft-struct and bridge address
and TIO and non-TIO - 4 functions for each register access, rather than 1 ?
That seems to add a lot of extra code now and we'll need to add new 
functions as we add more ASIC interfaces - which is exactly
what we are trying to avoid. The way we have it, if we add a new ASIC we 
just need to make the lowest level functions ASIC-aware
and then we are done - no need to have blocks of if-then-else code in 
the mainline to determine which function to call.
