 * Notes:
 * - I recently got a 16.8G IBM DTTA, so I was able to test it with
 *   a large and fast disk - the results look great, so I'd say the
 *   driver is working fine :-)
 *   hdparm -t reports 8.17 MB/sec at about 6% CPU usage for the DTTA
 * - this is my first linux driver, so there's probably a lot  of room
 *   for optimizations and bug fixing, so feel free to do it.
 * - use idebus=xx parameter to set PCI bus speed - needed to calc
 *   timings for PIO modes (default will be 40)
 * - if using PIO mode it's a good idea to set the PIO mode and
 *   32-bit I/O support (if possible), e.g. hdparm -p2 -c1 /dev/hda
 * - I had some problems with my IBM DHEA with PIO modes < 2
 *   (lost interrupts) ?????
 * - first tests with DMA look okay, they seem to work, but there is a
 *   problem with sound - the BusMaster IDE TimeOut should fixed this
This is your fix....
