   Nice but one request - can you call the protocol handlers first and if
   they return -ENOTTY then call the default ones provided by the upper
   layer. That will let you remove even more common code to most versions,
   make it work like the serial and other layers do, and still let people
   override defaults
Actually the cases he removed this round I am reasonably certain no
protocol should ever need to override.
