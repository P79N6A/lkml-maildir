I have an ASUS A7V with BIOS 1008.  Once per boot I get the kernel
message "spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7".  Also, the ERR field in
/proc/interrupts does seem to slowly increase with uptime.  These
symptoms occur with all three kernels I have checked: 2.4.10 with
UP_IOAPIC=y, 2.4.9-ac15 with UP_IOAPIC=y and UP_APIC=y, and 2.4.9-ac15
with UP_IOAPIC=n and UP_APIC=y.
This situation seems harmless enough, but if anyone would like more
data I'd be happy to try out stuff.
Cheers, Wayne
