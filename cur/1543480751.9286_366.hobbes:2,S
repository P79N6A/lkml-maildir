I'll admit that I haven't been avidly following the whole thread going on
regarding the problems that people have been having with Netscape as of late
but it's gotten so bad recently that I've just got to throw in my own two
cents....
I'm running Netscape 4.5 here on my RH 5.2 machine w/2.2pre7-ac2 and have
found that more and more often with the newer kernels its hanging up.  Don't
recall this happening in any of the 2.1.13x kernels that I'd tried, but with
the 2.2pre kernels it's happening about every half hour to an hour now.  Not
just when I'm browsing either, it frequently locks up when just picking up my
e-mail or un-iconifying the window.  I've found that by opening up more
windows when browsing, I can cause the whole thing to just lock up that much
more quickly than when running just a single browser window.  Quite a pain
though, as I usually browse with about 15-20 windows open at once.  My
girlfriend on the other hand, uses one window only and has never experienced a
lockup.
From what I do recall having seen in the postings as of late, I get the sense
that it has to do with Netscape entering a race condition with the sockets
that are feeding information into it's own threading loop.  I'm going to wager
a guess that many people out there simply aren't experiencing the problems as
they're primarily running it on a standard modem as opposed to a
LAN/ISDN/ADSL/cable modem.  I've got a cable modem here and I'm wagering that
it's just feeding stuff in fast enough to force the race condition to occur.
Aside from just chucking out Netscape and moving off to some other browser
(which isn't a viable alternative for me at this point), are there any
suggestions as to what can be done to try to remedy this problem?  Ideas?
