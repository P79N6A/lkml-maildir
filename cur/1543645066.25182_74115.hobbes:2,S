		Procps 2.0.8
		27 Sep 2002
Procps is the package containing various system monitoring tools, like
ps, top, vmstat, free, kill, sysctl, uptime and more.  After a long
period of inactivity procps maintenance is active again and suggestions,
bugreports and patches are always welcome on the procps list.
The plan is to release a procps 2.1.0 around the time the 2.6.0 kernel
comes out, with maybe one extra intermediary release between now and
then.  Various features and code cleanups are planned, the /proc changes
in 2.5 are also sure to keep the procps maintainers busy...
You can download procps 2.0.8 from:

If you have feedback (or patches) for the procps team, feel free to
mail us at:
