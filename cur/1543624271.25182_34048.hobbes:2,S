Alan, did you actually look at the diffs that Martin sent out, or are you 
just reacting to the description?
I think you read more into the description than was actually in the patch 
itself.
Rule #1: always read the patch.
Right now, that patch definitely needs to learn to use "yield()" instead
of "schedule()" etc details, but I really don't understand why all the 
brouhaha over Martins patches.
Am I really the only one who actually reads the actual _changes_ instead
of arguing over personal issues?
Now, I've long had this theory that IDE coding is bad for your mental
health (you won't ever see _me_ going close to the dang thing - I'll use
it, but I won't start writing code for it), but that theory used to be a
_joke_, for chrissake! Don't make it appear a truism.
