Well, when we started the project, the 2.5.59 base was the most current.
Since then, there hasn't been time to try to update all of the drivers to
the 2.6 kernel.  I would like to eventually get there, but at this point
it's an unfunded mandate.
So, my question is just in general terms, what is supposed to occur to flush
blocks out to a block device?  Is the inode supposed to be marked as dirty
and queued on the superblock containing the block device file (sort of what
I expected to be seeing), or is there some other method?  I can transpose
between the 2.6 and 2.5 kernels enough to try to see what isn't happening,
unless the strategy has changed in the 2.6 kernel..
