Alexey,
It's the final zcat that is complaining -- last one in the script:
	(dd ibs="$off" skip=1 count=0 && dd bs=512k) <"$image" 2>/dev/null | \
		zcat >"$TMPFILE"
The 'dd' command begins at the gzip header of the kernel image file,
but it doesn't know where the end of the gzip area is, it just feeds
everything from $off to zcat, and zcat finds more data than it needs/wants.
still looking.
