a) The Documentation/networking/filters.txt may say so but i dont think so
either:
[root@localhost networking]# ls -al /dev/bpf0
ls: /dev/bpf0: No such file or directory
[root@localhost networking]# cd /dev/
[root@localhost /dev]# sh MAKEDEV bpf0
MAKEDEV: don't know how to make device "bpf0"
How can I make ethereal (or libpcap) work with LSF?
Thanks
Kurt
