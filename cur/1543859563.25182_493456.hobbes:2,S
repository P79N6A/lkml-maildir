If we define interface down as meaning that the device is powered down 
and the radio switched off, then (b) and (c) would presumably just need 
to ensure that the interface is downed. (a) is a slightly more special 
case - if the switch disables the radio, I guess we then want the driver 
to down the interface as well.
In the (a) case, drivers should presumably refuse to bring the interface 
up if the radio is disabled?
