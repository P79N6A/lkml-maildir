I think it's time to wake you up from your warm and fuzzy "all the
world is an x86" dream.
Al's initramfs works on *all* architectures, not only on an
architecture which happens to have a bootloader bloated enough to be an
operating system in itself.
Let me disturb you even further: you might think that a full featured
bootloader/firmware is a Good Thing, but in the ARM Linux world we have
learned that a simple bootloader is *much* better for maintainability.
I think the ACPI problems exactly show my point: depending on BIOS
vendors to get the ACPI tables right just doesn't work.
