I'm using 9904191100 with kernel 2.2.9 at the moment and it works fine for me.
But Im not using two ISDN lines and so I can not check that. BTW: the internal
compression algorythems does not seem to work very well here. 
With textfiles (mail) I'm a much higher trasfer rate without compression. Make
sure you're using -vj, -vjccomp, -pc and -bsdcomp.
