No, it's just mostly irrelevant under SATA.
Under SATA you are -not- talking to a device when you touch 
Status/AltStatus, you are talking to the host controller.  Specifically, 
you're talking to a controller buffer that stores a copy of the ATA 
shadow registers.
The ATA registers are transmitted to the device in a single packet, 
called a FIS, when the Command or Device Control register is written.
When the device updates its status, or completes a command, it sends a 
FIS from device to controller, instructing the controller to update its 
cached copy of the Status register.
You're bitbanging a buffer, in SATA.
