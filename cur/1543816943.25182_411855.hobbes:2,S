Yes, this is the essence of it all. Globals are bad, mmm'kay?
This raises a very interesting question. All those LSM globals,
shouldn't those be virtualisable, too? After all, isn't it natural to
want to apply a different security policy to different sets of processes?
I don't think anyone's done any work on this yet...
Man, fork() is going to get really expensive if we don't put in the
"process family" abstraction... but like you say, it comes later,
getting the semantics right comes first.

Indeed. Lots of old turds to clean up...
