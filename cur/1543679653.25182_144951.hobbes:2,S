The rmap functions perform kmap_atomic() internally while traversing
pte_chains and so will take various additional TLB misses and incur
various bits of computational expense with i386's kmap_atomic() semantics.
The observations I made were in combination with both highpmd and an as
of yet unmerged full 3-level pagetable cacheing patch.
