And all these should _not_ happen in the actual tools but in a
pluggable security module (something like pam).  Encoding any security
policy and especially a xattr name in those utils is bad.
And see, you start to contradict what you said before - with your
suggestion cron has to know what the label means, so your selinux
cron would do stupid things with say may Posix 1003.1e MAC filesystem.
