I'm ok with increasing HZ but not so ok with decreasing time slices.
When you switch a task you've a fixed cost ( tlb, cache image,... ) that,
if you decrease the time slice, you're going to weigh with a lower run time
highering its percent impact.
The more interactive feel can be achieved by using a real BVT
implementation :
-            p->counter = (p->counter >> 1) + NICE_TO_TICKS(p->nice);
+            p->counter += NICE_TO_TICKS(p->nice);
The only problem with this is that, with certain task run patterns,
processes can run a long time ( having an high dynamic priority ) before
they get scheduled.
What i was thinking was something like, in timer.c :
        if (p->counter > decay_ticks)
            --p->counter;
        else if (++p->timer_ticks >= MAX_RUN_TIME) {
            p->counter -= p->timer_ticks;
            p->timer_ticks = 0;
            p->need_resched = 1;
        }
Having MAX_RUN_TIME ~= NICE_TO_TICKS(0)
In this way I/O bound tasks can run with high priority giving a better
interactive feel, w/out running too much freezing the system when exiting
from a quite long I/O wait.
