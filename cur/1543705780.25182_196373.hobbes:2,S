Not really.  FUSE and the linux VFS have not much in common except they
both have a similar set of operations (open, read, write, mkdir,
unlink, etc.).  But linux VFS is much more generic.

Yeah, a working UDF implementation would be good.  It's very easy to
prototype such an FS in FUSE.  Any takers? ;)

The homepage and SF project page of AVFS and FUSE are a mess.  Sorry
about that.

That is true.  the name FUSE turned out to be unfortunate, because
it's an often chosen project name.
