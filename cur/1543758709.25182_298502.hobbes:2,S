Hello Marcelo,
As per our offline conversation, I have verified the update that went into
2.4.30-pre2.
I confirm that all changes are correct. I have only one doubt: The driver
was using
sleep_on_timeout  for lack of msleep. Should it start using msleep now?
Vasily & Andrey, thank you for your efforts.
Thanks,
Sreenivas
