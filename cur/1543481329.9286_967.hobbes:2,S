	Which is why you have to have something like Linux first.  The
Hurd languished because its creators tried to do the drivers and the
common algorithms at the same time as the NGOS design.  The OSKit is
essentially linux and freebsd source all chopped up into components with
COM interfaces and mixed together.  This allows good NG designs to be
implemented quickly and optimized over time.

	Me either, but it will happen.  The mores successful NGOSes are
not desireable for nothing.  If they provide a clear and present benfit,
they will be used.

	I'm not talking about API particulars, I'm talking about the 
fundamentals of the OS design.  A nested process/PVM OS is nothing like a 
traditional Unix kernel.
