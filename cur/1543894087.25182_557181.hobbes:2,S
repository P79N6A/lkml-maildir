  It depends how large components you expect. For example for 10000
messages there is already 1% probability of collision so it means sooner or
later we are going to hit it... For 1000 messages the probability is
roughly 0.1% which is still not so small that I'd be comfortable with it.
On the other hand we could use something like gperf to generate perfect
hashing function and then we don't have to worry about colisions.
