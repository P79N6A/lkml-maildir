Hm. I tried adding it in the eh code after ata_set_mode() in 
ata_eh_recover(), which alters the problem slightly - hpa_sectors is 
still 0, so the taskfile call is still failing, but now the system just 
stops at around the time that anything attempts to access sda with no 
errors other than
sd: 2:0:1:0: timing out command, waited 180s
sd: 2:0:1:0: SCSI error: return code = 0x00000028
end_request: I/O error, dev sda, sector 0
Buffer I/O error on device sda, logical block 0
