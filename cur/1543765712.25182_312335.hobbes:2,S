No, do not do this.  Even the i386 platform can get away with doing this
kind of io memory addressing, but drivers do not do that, as they are
not portable.  The first time someone wants to use this kind of i2c
adapter on a non-coldfire chip, they will have to rewrite the driver,
not acceptable.
Also, you did not include a good Changelog entry, nor a Signed-off-by:
line, and you attached the file in a mime attachment.
Please fix these issues up.
