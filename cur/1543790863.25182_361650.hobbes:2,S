Indeed - a prime example is the bootmem initialisation problem.  Had
I known on 1st October that the final release wouldn't have been for
a long time, I'd have applied that patch and you wouldn't have had
that problem with ARM relying on the bootmem initialisation order
clashing with your ia64 (or x86_64) swiotlb fix.
But stupid rmk - again I hasten to add - was suckered into this "-rc
is frozen" idea again and decided it wasn't appropriate to submit it.
In hind-sight, there would have been plenty of time to sort out any
issues.
Hell, we held up 2.6.14 for swiotlb _anyway_.
Time to start writing those lines...
