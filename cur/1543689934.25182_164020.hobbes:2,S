Its a way of exposing asynchronicity keeping the old instruction set.
Its trying to make better use of the bandwidth available by having
something else to schedule into stalls. Thats why HT is really good for
code which is full of polling I/O, badly coded memory accesses but is
worthless on perfectly tuned hand coded stuff which doesnt stall.
Its great feature is that HT gets *more* not less useful as the CPU gets
faster..
