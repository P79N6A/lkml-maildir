Usually a patch not tested will never be accepted no matter how trivial
it is, unless you had to modify a driver to match a new syntax or
something and you don't have the device.  Did you at least compile it?

Yes, swapper is because of historical reasons.  In most text books for
Unix, the initial process on boot up is called "swapper".  Probably
because those early Unix systems had this process handle the swapping
(as kswapd does today).
By doing this, it will probably make Linux out of sync with all the text
books on Unix, so it really is Linus' call.
