This is not totally unrelated, as I want this base structure to be
aligned in UP case as well, as the lower bits in the pointer to base is
overloaded.

Yes. Will do.

Yes. deferrable sounds better. Will change.

OK. I will look at having the setup functions this way. I guess this
should be better as we will never want to use a single timer in both
deferrrable and non-deferrable modes. Will refresh the patch with these
changes soon.
