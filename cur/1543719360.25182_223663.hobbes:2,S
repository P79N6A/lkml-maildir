Hi,
Here are some driver core fixes for 2.6.7-rc1.  This set of patches also
includes the removal of the smbios driver, which the author wanted to
have removed after realizing that it was not needed.
Please pull from:
	bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/driver-2.6
thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.
