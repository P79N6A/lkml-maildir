You guessed right... I did enable IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH_CACHED, I have now 
disabled it and equal multi path routing in general (CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH).
As it is a production server, I'll need to schedule a reboot. The server 
has now been running a 2.4.26 kernel for 16 hours without any kernel 
panics.  And the ip_dst_cache can grow and shink.
cat /proc/slabinfo | grep ip_dst_cache
ip_dst_cache       15300  56145    256 1022 3743    1
