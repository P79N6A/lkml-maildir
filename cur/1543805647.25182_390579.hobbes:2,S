It's not my decision to keep Peter's patch out of mainline. If you can make a 
strong enough case for it then Linus will merge it up even though it's after 
rc1. Otherwise I'll let Ingo decide on whether to pull the current 
implementation or not - you're saying that with the one thing you described 
that misbehaves that it is doing more harm than fixing smp nice handling.
