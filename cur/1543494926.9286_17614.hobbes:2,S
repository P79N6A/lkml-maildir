The reason that Windows 95/98 can do this is because of the fact that they
are user-level programs.  They are not full operating systems.  For this
to work with Linux, the kernel would have to put the processor in Real
Mode and call int 19 (I think it's 19).  That loads the boot loader, but
the processor has to be in 100% real mode or it freezes.  No memory
management, nothing.
The only configuration that's allowed that was MS-DOS (or any other DOS
except FreeDOS, AFAIK) that didn't have ANY device drivers loaded.

How so?  /proc is a filesystem set up by the kernel AFTER a boot.  LILO
can't access that, unless it's got technology that allows it to jump into
the future. =)

Don't think that would work.
