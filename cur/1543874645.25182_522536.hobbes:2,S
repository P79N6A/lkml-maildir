I have seen some patches that make the drivers I/O port free here:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/26/261
I checked and they still aren't in the mainline.  
I don't know that it matters though because I see all the disks attached
to the system regardless of whether or not the adapters get I/O space.
The real issue I have is with all the error messages I get at boot.  I
see 40+ messages that say "PCI: Failed to allocate I/O
resource..." (from setup-res.c) when the kernel tries to allocate the
I/O space and can't.  The modules load fine.  I see all the disks just
fine.  But that many error messages tends to raise concerns and causes
support calls from customers.
