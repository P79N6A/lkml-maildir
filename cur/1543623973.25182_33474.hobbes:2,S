Chris,
I just took a look at what little information I have available on this
situation.. Namely the 'block-o-oops' from many ps processes..
I'm not sure I agree with you that it is a race in proc code. There are
several ps processes that oops'd over a period of 58 seconds. My guess is
that there is (was)  a process out there that has a corrupt  p->sig (==
0x00003296).  Hence, each time the user runs ps, the new ps trips over the
same corrupt task.
What really confuses me is what any of this has to do with the original
complaint about the system hanging.. Has that behaviour gone away?

I'm not sure exactly which vm problems you mean, but He's running the
suse 2.4.16, which is heavily patched. When your running big production
databases, upgrading to the kernel of the week isn't an option.
I think we've found the bug, it looks like a race in the proc code.
Oliver, someone will contact you a little later with instructions on
getting a kernel with the fix.  If you only see this oops during backups,
make sure you aren't trying to backup /proc.
