Subject: / on ramfs, possible?

I want my / to be a ramfs filesystem. I intend to populate it from an 
initrd image, and then remount / as the ramfs filesystem. Is that at 
all possible? The way I see it the kernel requires / on a device 
(major,minor) or nfs.
Am I out of luck using ramfs as /? If it's easy to fix, how do I fix it?
