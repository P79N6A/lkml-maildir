Subject: [PATCH] Solving DMA hangup with QDI Commander3 motherboard
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Greetings,
The attached patch solves a problem with some Intel chipset for PII
motherboards, regarding DMA transfers.
Symptoms: a complete and total hang of the Linux kernel when more than 1 DMA
transfer is in progress (for example, playing music and making a backup on
floppy tape). No messages are printed on the console. No oops or panic.
Reproducibility: yes, always within 5-60 seconds of simultaneous DMA
transfer; the higher the DMA transfer rates, the faster the crash.
Systems affected: my motherboard is labeled as a "P6I440FX/Pentium II
Commander III" from QDI. The PCI IDs are in the patch.
Solution: the motherboard is placed in the list of systems that have a
buggy ISA DMA bridge in pci/quirks.c. Works 100%.
Side effects: none known.
Kernels: de patch goes cleanly into 2.3.18 and up. It's very simple, so it
shouldn't give troubles in other kernels.
Notes: this message is longer than the patch itself :)
**
Any comment are welcome; since I'm only on the kernel-digest list, a personal
reply or CC: is appreciated.
Cheers,
 - Nemosoft
