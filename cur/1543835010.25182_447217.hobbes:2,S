Anything else would be crazy, I'd say.

Well, in that case probably smapi driver should "hook into" acpi
driver.

I hope such hardware will not be too common. Thinkpad is covered by
accident, and I do not know about any other problematic machine.
Worst case, we would get equivalent of
/sys/class/battery/system_battery_acpi/...
/sys/class/battery/system_battery_some_clever_vendor_hack/...
with some values common between both of them. I'd say it is still
better than having vendor_hack in /sys in one format while having acpi
battery in /proc/acpi in completely different format.
