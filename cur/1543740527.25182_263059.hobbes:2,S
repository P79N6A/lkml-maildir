Understood -- we may be getting hung up on terminology here.
Rather the issue was whether the nondeterministic out-of-sequence
backoff could be pushed to a noncritical path. I believe so.
It is further likely a backoff would not be needed as the
a path acquiring a mutex's task-owned list lock during a
priority promotion scan shouldn't have reason to acquire any
task's mutex-owned list lock. The latter list would only need
to be locked at time of successful mutex acquisition/free.
