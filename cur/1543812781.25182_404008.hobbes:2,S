Not many people have access to shiny new 8-core 32-thread CPUs
(/me turns green saying this) :-)
To be honest I thought Linus' earlier fix that increased
RCU maximum batch size to 1000 had more or less fixed
the issue for most people. I haven't seen it in my testing,
but I agree that we have to take OOMs seriously. I am just being
paranoic here.
