2.4 does not reload CR3, unless you are using multiple user-space
processes.

as i told you in the previous mail, the main overhead is not CR3, it's the
copying & dirtying of all data, and the subsequent DMA-initiated dirty
cacheline writeback. I can serve 100 MB/sec web content with 2.4 & TUX
just fine - it relies on a zero-copying infrastructure.
