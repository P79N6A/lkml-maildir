Another warning: The sender of this SPAM is using its recipients in the
From: field, as well. At least two of the messages so far were sent from
my addresses.
The people in the From: field are valid addresses, but not at all
responsible for whatever is happening. (I know - two people already
complained to my sysadmin about having received the message from me).
If there's a lawyer on this list, I wonder if there's anything we can do
about that.
