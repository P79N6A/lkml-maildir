Hmm ..I guess we could restrict the max time a idle CPU will sleep taking
into account its balance interval. But whatever heuristics we follow to 
maximize balance_interval of about-to-sleep idle CPU, don't we still run the 
risk of idle cpu being woken up and going immediately back to sleep (because 
there was no imbalance)?
Moreover we may be greatly reducing the amount of time a CPU is allowed to 
sleep this way ...
