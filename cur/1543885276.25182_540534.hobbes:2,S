How do I do that? I tried `cpufreq-set -d 665 -u 665` (x5.0), but that
changed the frequency to 532 (x4.0).
I can set the CPU frequency in the BIOS, from x3.0 to x16.0, in x0.5
steps (base frequency is 133, DIMM freq is 266).
[ Actually, the values are a bit off,

analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: longhaul
  CPUs which need to switch frequency at the same time: 0
  hardware limits: 532 MHz - 731 MHz
  available frequency steps: 532 MHz, 598 MHz, 731 MHz, 665 MHz
  available cpufreq governors: performance
  current policy: frequency should be within 532 MHz and 731 MHz.
                  The governor "performance" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency is 731 MHz (asserted by call to hardware).

The BIOS default is x5.5, producing 733 MHz. With longhaul/cpufreq,
I can then choose from between 533 MHz (x4.0) and the value that was
set in the BIOS.
