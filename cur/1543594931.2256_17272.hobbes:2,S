Should be no problem. The RPC layer is not tied to any particular
filesystem.
On the client, you need to set up struct rpc_procinfo with the
necessary RPC XDR routines, which you then declare to the RPC layer
using a struct rpc_program and a call to rpc_create_client(). See
for instance linux/fs/lockd/mon.c, or linux/fs/nfs/mount_clnt.c...
For the server, things are likely to be a bit more complex in that you
need to declare the routines using structs svc_program, svc_version
and rpc_procinfo (again) and then set up a daemon process. Examples of
use include linux/fs/lockd/svc.c and linux/fs/nfsd/nfssvc.c...
