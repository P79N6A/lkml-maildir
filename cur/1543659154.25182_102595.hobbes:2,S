Precisely. Or a random IRQ from a drive power change or hotplug that
passed our command in the other direction.
We could actually address this another way which might even be easier, 
that is in the IRQ path to wait the 400nS if BSY isnt asserted. I need
to go reread the spec to check if we can poll it before the timeout
but not trust the data, or cannot poll it.
