To obtain a list of tunnels, this tool calls SIOCGETTUNNEL
(SIOCDEVPRIVATE + 0) for every device in /proc/net/dev. I don't think
this is safe, but I don't have a solution for you.
Is there a reason why you have a separate tool rather than modifying
iproute2?
I don't know if you are aware of this older etherip patch by Lennert
