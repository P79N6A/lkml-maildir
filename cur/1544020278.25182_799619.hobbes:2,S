The problem here is that we use proc_doulongvec_minmax(), which expects an 
unsigned long. Most other sysctls use the dointvec versions and are safe, 
as long as they pass an int. If they pass a char or a short, they're 
subject to the same problem.
The other sysctls in sysctl.c that use proc_doulongvec_minmax() don't pass 
a min/max value. The others in the kernel I checked do the same or pass a 
proper unsigned long.
