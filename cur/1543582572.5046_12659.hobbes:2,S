I was more thinking about just using "dentry->d_name->hash" directly, and
not worrying about how that hash was computed. Yes, for ext2 it will have
the same value as "full_name_hash" - the difference really being that
d_hash has already been precomputed for you anyway.

Note that dentry->d_name->hash is really quick (no extra computation), but
I'm not claiming that it has anything like a CRC quality. And it's
probably a bad idea to use it, because in theory at least the VFS layer
might decide to switch the hash function around. I'm more interested in
hearing whether it's a good hash, and maybe we could improve the VFS hash
enough that there's no reason to use anything else..
