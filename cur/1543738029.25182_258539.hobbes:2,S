The accept one is documented by Stevens and well known. In the UDP case
currently we could get precise behaviour - by halving performance of UDP
applications like video streaming. We probably don't want to  because we
can respond intelligently to OOM situations by freeing the queue if we
don't enforce such a silly rule.
