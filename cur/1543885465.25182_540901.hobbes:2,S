Are questions welcome? Then I'd ask: "What are the _minimal_ CPU
requirements to gain anything (eg less power consumption) with
dyntick?"
I ask because of a trial round with Chris Wright's patch set on a
fresh battery, idle system outside X with wifi card shut off and HZ
set to 100 (from my normal 1000):

The script just touched the "stop" file with a 2 minutes interval until
the machine died. As seen by the plus/minus 2 minutes results there is
absolutely no difference.
This AMD 64 Mobile processor only has a C1 level which isn't used:
root@sleipner:~# cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
active state:            C1
max_cstate:              C8
bus master activity:     00000000
maximum allowed latency: 2000 usec
states:
   *C1:                  type[C1] promotion[--] demotion[--]
latency[000] usage[00000000] duration[00000000000000000000]
But shouldn't the the kernel 'hlt' routine, or whatever it's called,
work in conjunction with dyntick to achieve... something...?
