Okay, that may be a possibility.  I'll look into that.
However, isn't it a bad thing that a vanilla 2.6.9-rc3 can be totally locked up 
by an unpriviledged user by running two tasks?
It seems to me that the OOM-killer not waking up is a bug.  I should not be able 
to lock up the system by running it out of memory--it should wake up and start 
killing things rather than hang the system.
