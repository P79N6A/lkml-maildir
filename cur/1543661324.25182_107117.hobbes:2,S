The problem still exists in -pre9, but is very much rarer and harder to
replicate; I've sene it only half a dozen times in two weeks, in each
case during an ftp retrieval; I'm assuming there's something about the
write patterns used by ncftp (lots of few-KB appends, far apart in time)
that triggers it.
So it really is merely a timing change that has brought a pre-existing
problem into the light.
I'm going to try to come up with something that consistently reproduces
this as well, so I can track down the origins of this bug more
correctly.
