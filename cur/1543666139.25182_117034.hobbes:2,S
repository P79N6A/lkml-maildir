I have another use for this : for remote management, I'd like to have a
short-time watchdog and a long-time watchdog. The short time watchdog would
avoid remote users to be annoyed by a system hang which takes too long a time
to reboot, while the long one would allow me to recover from a wrong
manipulation in a time shorter than what it takes to get on the remote site :
when I do something risky (network restart, fw...), I simply kill the long
watchdog daemon so that I do my work while the counter still runs. If I shoot
myself in the foot, it will end in a spontaneous reboot. But I don't want the
system to always run on such a slow timer, reason for the second watchdog.
Cheers,
Willy
