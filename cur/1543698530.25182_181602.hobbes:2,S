I used the discontigmem code because this is what we have now.
My hacks such as zone_active[] will go away when the memory hot add
code (on which Goto-san is working on) is ready.

Thanks for pointing out.  I looked at the patch.
It should be doable to make my patch work with the CONFIG_NONLINEAR
code.  For my code to work, basically the following functionarities
are necessary:
1. disabling alloc_page from hot-removing area
and
2. enumerating pages in use in hot-removing area.
My target is somewhat NUMA-ish and fairly large.  So I'm not sure if
CONFIG_NONLINEAR fits, but CONFIG_NUMA isn't perfect either.

This is necessary because kernel memory cannot be swapped out.
Only highmem can be hot removed, though it doesn't need to be highmem.
We can define another zone attribute such as GFP_HOTPLUGGABLE.
