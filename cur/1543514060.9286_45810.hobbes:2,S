     The patch that Dave Miller posted here a bit ago for Sparc SMP 32 bit
hardware didn't help on my systems.  It changed the nature of the crash so
instead of getting spin_lock(... blah blah blah, I'd get spin_lock_irq(... blah
blah blah, but the actual frequency of crashes seemed to get worse instead of
better. 
     Tonight I installed 2.2.13 on my web server and news server, both SS-10's
with quad RTK-625 CPU's.  The web server is still running, the news server
crashed after about an hour with:
spin_lock_irqsave(f015c4bc) CPU#0 stuck at f0113fe8, owner PC(f00fcfc4):CPU(0)
     This is the first time I've ever seen the stuck CPU be the same as the
owner of the lock.
     This may be hardware related, mainboard on the news machine is dying.  I
am getting ethernet memory errors and all sorts of SCSI flakiness (and SCSI
controller and ethernet are built in on these).  I have a new mainboard coming
so will replace it before posting any further reports of problems with this
particular machine. 
     The web server continues to run good now about six hours on 2.2.13 so
hopefully new hardware will make the other machine happier.
