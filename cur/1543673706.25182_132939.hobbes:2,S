hmm.
One possible timing diagram is
	truncate:				pagefault:
						check i_size
						grab page
	drop i_size
	shoot down pagetables
						install in pagetables
	truncate file
converting i_sem to an rwsem and taking it in the pagefault would certainly
stitch it up.  Unpopular, very messy.
Could "truncate file" return some code to say pages were left behind, so
truncate re-runs zap_page_range()?  Sounds unpleasant.
Yes, re-checking the page against i_size from do_no_page() would fix it up.
 But damn, that's another indirect call, 64-bit math, etc on _every_
file-backed pagefault.
Remind me again what problem this whole thing is currently causing?
