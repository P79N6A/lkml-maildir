GigaByte's BIOS config options of the onboard graphics controller are
very limited compared to those on your Intel motherboard.
I can only choose the graphics buffer size, between
"1MB+1~2MB for GTT" or "8MB+1~2MB for GTT".
I chose the latter. The POST says 9MB are taken for video.
Not that it matters much, as the current i810/intel xorg driver does
not yet support the GMA3100, so I'm using the vesa driver.
Thanks,
Pim
