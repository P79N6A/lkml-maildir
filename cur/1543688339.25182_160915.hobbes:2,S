In the past couple of years, probably the most valuable asset in
developping both the hardware and the software of our PCI boards has
been the VMetro PCI bus analyzer/excerciser. The analyzer allows us to
watch and trace all PCI signals/cycles in real time, while the
excerciser gives us the capability to probe/drive all mem/io/config
address ranges which are visible from the bus which the bus analyzer
board is sitting on. This excludes everything beyond the PCI bus domain
unless you are able to hook an additional signal to one of the general
purpose trace inputs.
In fact, I'd never ever develop a driver for whichever OS you like
without such a tool - it spoils you ;-) As it turned out, it's even
more valuable in software development than hardware development.
Ciao,
