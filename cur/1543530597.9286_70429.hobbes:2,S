Ok.  I'll try that.  However, I did try 2.3.99-pre1 with the following
settings:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA=y
CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX=y
CONFIG_PIIX_TUNING=y
Note the PIIX_TUNING is different than the one you listed.  Typing too fast
or is there a difference?  (Haven't unpackaged the above patches yet; will
do shortly).
