Subject: [RFC][PATCH] fix xconsole.

Precedence: bulk

Long ago xconsole broke (a regression) and it has been a mystery to
me.  One of my coworkers mentioned it again and I happened to been
looking at code in the vicinity and I finally figured out what
happened.
From the tty_ioctl manpage  TIOCCONS is documented as:
  Redirecting console output
       TIOCCONS  void
              Redirect output that would have gone to /dev/console or
              /dev/tty0 to the given tty.  If that was a pty master,
              send it to the slave.  Anybody can do this as long as
              the output was not redirected yet.  If it was redirected
              already EBUSY is returned, but root may stop redirection
              by using this ioctl with fd pointing at /dev/console or
              /dev/tty0.
And it used to match the implementation. But then we had what appears
to be an overzealous security fix.
The console messages may only be redirected once, and root may perform
that initial redirection.  So I don't see why it is a security issue.
Do we have a better way to see console messages when we are in X?
I haven't seen it. 
Perhaps if we had a working xconsole we would have less random spew to
the console.
