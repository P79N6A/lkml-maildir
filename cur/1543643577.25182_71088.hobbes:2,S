Well, yes.  I think Daniel, yourself and I all share a dislike for
try_inc_mod_count() everywhere, but it *is* one solution.

Please explain?  It has to be atomic for all the interesting cases
(sure, fs mounting might be protected by a lock, but other things aren't).

Yes, this is a problem.  It's a little icky to fix though, since you
must disallow the *same* module being loaded.  I can certainly do it:
well spotted.

Yes, which means an atomic reference count somewhere.  At the moment I
spin inside the cleanup() routine (not nice at all).
