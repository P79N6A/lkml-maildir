well.. while i like this idea, i doubt it is ever going to work, since
3d would probably be a requirement, and with stuff like nvidia around, i
doubt most people would want to pay the money it would require, since
ati and nvidia can smash out millions of cards, while it would probably
be at best, a couple of thousands of these opensource cards that could
be sold, i, for one would like to pay, however i dont think mainstream
will... and as of for 2d only, well :| i kindof needs 3d :(
but certainly a good idea, and maybe in future, if linux grows more
used, it will actually be possible to do something real kicking ass ;)
