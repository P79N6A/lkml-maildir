This currently isn't working, and you are right that it would require
extra code.

No.  The registers are basically hardwired as either a 128bit register for
bitwise operations (aka, xorps, andps, etc) or as 4 32bit sp floating
point registers.  How they are encoded is determined by the instruction of
course, and last I knew, there are no instructions to use them as 2 64 bit
entities.
