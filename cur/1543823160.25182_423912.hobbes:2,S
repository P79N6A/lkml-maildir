Thanks for your list, but I'm missing the SATA chipset that our Asus-Boxes 
got:
0000:00:14.1 IDE interface: ATI Technologies Inc ATI Dual Channel Bus 
Master PCI IDE Controller
(PCI-ID 1002:4349)
Or is this something different like an IDE chipset with included SATA 
bridges or so?
It is supported through the atiixp ide driver, but only really slow 
(10mb/s) - the same disks attached to an Intel SATA port give 30-40mb/s.
