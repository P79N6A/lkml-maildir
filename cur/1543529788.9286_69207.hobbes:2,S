Try opening /dev/dsp. I don't think it will work. It shouldn't. I can see
lots of problems here.

Doesn't X server have keys to changes modes. I know the regular XFree86
servers do. I have used keys for this. If X server fb doesn't do this then
its broken and it should function just like other X servers.

fbtv is also broken. I have discussed this. In reality the video4linux
drivers should be getting info from the fbdev driver directly instead of
this way. I told Alan about this. He didn't listen.

Ha? The open flag is per fbdev driver.
