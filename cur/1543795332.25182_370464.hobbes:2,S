You are working from a kernel view address of a page that may be user
space. You don't need or want to kill anything because you are scrubbing
a corrected error.

This is a correctable error so there would be no abort. And there is a
race if you think for a microsecond or two
		Scrubber reads   (add #0 load of input)
		Bus master writes #FFFFFFFF
		Scrubber writes back #0
The lock prefix ensures that doesn't occur.

Then the EDAC code will reconfigure the registers back as expected by
the PC architecture. I've no problem with that and if EDAC is the only
person requiring a semantic that is more expensive it can flip the bits
back and forth. No need for anyone else to pay that cost.
