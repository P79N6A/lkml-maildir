Definitely. They can't explain anything about the VM deadlocks. I was
_only_ talking about the blkdev hangs that caused you to unplug the
queue at each reschedule in tux and that Eric reported me for the SG
driver (and I very much hope that with EXCLUSIVE gone away and the
wait_on_* fixed those hangs will go away because I don't see anything else
wrong at this moment).

Exactly, that's the only thing I was talking about in this subthread.
