They resynced at power up, but would constantly drift. I don't even know
if it was caused by power states. When the machine was loaded, a single
task moving across the cores could see its time jump back and forth 
several times a second by an offset sometimes close to +2/-2s.

Yes, I remember trying such things. I also tried 'nohlt', completely
disabling power management, including ACPI, etc... I also tried vanilla
kernels as well as severely patched ones, but the problem remained the
same in all circumstances, that only 'notsc' could solve.
BTW, I've just found a remain of dmesg capture after boot in case you'd
like to look for anything in it.

Willy
