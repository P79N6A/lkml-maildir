Dear Dear Jens Axboe,
I will try debench on the fs with larger xfer size when I enter my Lab. next 
time.
In the previous testing I do iometer and bonnie++ bench with ext3 riserfs 
file system.
I have test the transfer size from 2K to 5M with random/sequence read/write 
each term 2 hours.
When those three testing platforms all have completion.
There were not any one message appear as this.
I have done same testing with ext2 512 sectors and all done well.
I will find the difference of each LBA value , request length between 512 
sectors and 4096 sectors.
Best Regards
Erich Chen
