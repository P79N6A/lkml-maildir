Much as I hate to extend the life of this execrable thread, since I
think Alexandre makes Sisyphus look like a hard-nosed pragmatist, it
seems pretty clear that TiVO impinges "[my] freedom to run the
program, for any purpose" if "any purpose" includes "make my TiVO do
what I want," and likewise to "adapt it to [my] needs" -- freedoms 0
and part of 1. It is just disingenuous to argue otherwise.
