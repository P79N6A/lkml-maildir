	Sorry if I was not clear enough about the purpose of of
the new scatterlist->driver_priv field.  It is a "streaming" data
structure to use the terminology of DMA-maping.txt (i.e., one that
would typically only be allocated for a few microseconds as an IO is
built up and sent).  Its purpose is to hold the hardware-specific
gather-scatter segment descriptor, which typically look something like this:
		struct foo_corporation_scsi_controller_sg_element {
			u64	data_addr;
			u64	next_addr;
			u16	data_len;
			u16	reserved;
			u32	various_flags;
		}
		
	I probably should not have mentioned adding sg->driver_priv{,_dma}
in my proposal, because it is largely independent.  The reason that
it is related is that it should allow the "mid-layer" device driver code
(scsi.c, usb.c, etc.) to do all of the streaming DMA mapping for
typical DMA-based device drivers.
	Come to think of it, my use of pci_map_single is incorrect
after all, because the driver has not yet filled in that data structure
at that point.  Since the data structures are being allocated from a
single contiguous block that spans a couple of pages that is being used
only for this purpose, perhaps I would be fastest to pci_alloc_consistent
the whole memory pool for those little descriptors at initialization time
and then change that loop to do the following.
		sg->driver_priv = mempool_alloc(q->sgpriv_pol, GFP_KERNEL);
		sg->driver_priv_dma = (sg->driver_priv - q->driver_priv_start)+
				sg->driver_priv_start_dma_addr;
>Also, this while loop never terminates :-)
	Oops!  Sorry.  The bottom of that loop needs
		sg = sg->next;
