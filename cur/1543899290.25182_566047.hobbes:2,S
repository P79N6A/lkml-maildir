(Not that I'm advocating this, but:)
You could ask fused to identify tasks involved in fuse handling. "Hey,
fused, please give me list of PIDs".
Yes, that would be beyond ugly.
(I guess I'm advocating this:)
We probably can do variation on this. Notify fuse early that suspend
is comming, so we can wait for all the fused requests to be flushed
(/fusectl/*/waiting going to 0), and then just trap tasks trying to
communicate with fuse in a sane place (i.e. not a place where VFS
locks are held).
...I'm not saying this is a nice solution, but it should
work... right...? And should work for hibernation, too...?
(at this point, we still have problem 1: something in s2ram path
causes fuse to communicate with its frozen fused. It is not sync, so
what is it?)
