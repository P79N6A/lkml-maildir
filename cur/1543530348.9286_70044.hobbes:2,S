And just where is the CLONE_FS coming from ?
Im very careful here. I change the fs struct of the thread specifically to
avoid that kind of attack. If I changed current->fs->root you would be right,
but since I change current->fs the rest of the thread goup shouldn't be able
to do anything as their current->fs is different to our temporary one. If
another thread chroots() our thread group then we will restore to the 
thread group fs and thus the chroot will still work fine.
So I think its ok
