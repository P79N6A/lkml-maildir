Hi,
    I just compiled a new 2.2.13 stock kernel on an old 486 machine I have.
The kernel seems to boot up fine, but right after init starts (INIT: version
2.76 booting) pops up, the machine just sits there for awhile.  And right about
the time I was tempted to hit Ctrl+alt+del, there was some hard drive activity,
and I saw an OOPS fly by, and the machine rebooted. I was wondering if there is
some way to capture this OOPS before the machine reboots... I was thinking
about applying SGI's lkcd patch, but I wanted to see if there was any other
solution.
Oh yeah, the slackware 7.0 bare.i kernel boots up fine.
The machine is an older 486, with one of those overdrive chips on it...
completely ISA bus... OPTi IDE chipset (I think)... I have no idea who
manufactured the board.  There's not much on there to give me a clue.
Anyway, thanks in advance.
