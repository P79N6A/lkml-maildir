Thanks.
One more nit:
bugzilla-daemon@bughost.org seems like normal bugzilla, where you can
hit reply button, and control it using email... but that does not
actually work.
It would be nice to fix that. (Or at least make mail appear from
noreply@bughost.org, so that it is plain to see it does not work).
It seems that iwl3945 problem is somehow linked to
GROUP_SCHED... probably iwl can not handle latencies introduced by it?
