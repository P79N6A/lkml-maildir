The other thing to watch is that you need to delete the timer before you unload
As you can safely del_timer() an initialised but already deleted timer that
isnt too onerous.
Waiting for a thread in the module unload is trickier. You cannot simply kill
the thread as it may run after cleanup_module() returns. Instead you do
static void cleanup_module(void)
{
	kill_thread();
	down(&thread_sem);
	printk("Thread dead\n");
}
and in the thread exit path do
	up_and_exit(&thread_sem, error_code);
This ensures that the thread of execution has left the module code space and
will not return.
