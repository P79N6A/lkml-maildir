We discussed it, but iirc we worked out that it wouldn't have any useful
effect on the frequency at which we take the buddy lock.
It adds more code and it adds special knowledge of hotness and coldness to
the core page allocator.  The intention was that the argument called `cold'
could be renamed to `pcp_index' or whatever so that we could add more head
arrays in the future.  For known-to-be-zero pages.

Nope.

The cold pages are mainly intended to be the pages which will be placed
under DMA transfers.  We should never return hot pages in response for a
request for a cold page.
