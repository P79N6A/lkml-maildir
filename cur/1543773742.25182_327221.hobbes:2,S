The reason I requested git-checkout-script is to make git-switch-tree 
pretty much trivial.  The new git-switch-tree will sit on top of 
git-checkout-script, like
	if $1
		switch HEAD to refs/heads/$1
	git-checkout-script
So, as created, git-checkout-script is a useful foundation for other 
scripts.
As of right now, I only have two[1] scripts that are non-vanilla:
git-switch-tree:	retarget .git/HEAD to refs/heads/$1
git-new-branch:		cp refs/heads/master refs/heads/$1
With git-checkout-script, both of these are now trivial and obvious.

[1] Actually I have a third, 'git-changes-script'.  The only reason I 
use this is that it supports the old BitKeeper syntax of
	cd my-repo-2.6
	git-changes-script -L ../linux-2.6
to obtain a list of changes that are _only_ present in my-repo-2.6, and 
not in ../linux-2.6 repo.  git-changes-script works with .git/HEAD at 
the repo level, and knows nothing of branches (which is fine).
