[I initially sent this query inappropriately to an individual instead of
the list. My apologies.]
re: tee().. I was just playing around with the simple sample on the
manpage (included below) - it uses SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK as a flag. 
on 2.6.22 X86_64 (ubuntu 7.10) when I run the sample. the tee() system
call returns the right number of bytes from the input - sometimes as the
sum of multiple calls. When the input is exhauted tee() starts returning
(-1,EAGAIN) forever.. it never returns 0 and the program never
completes.
without a 0, how is EOF indicated?
do_tee() contains:
       if (!ret && (flags & SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK))
               ret = -EAGAIN;
so it's pretty clear where it comes from.. but finding EOF eludes me ;)
remove the NONBLOCK flag and 0 happens just fine.
NONBLOCK seems gratuitous in the sample, but it would make sense in some
code I am contemplating.. 
Any suggestions?

(This is the sample from the manpage which never completes.. I invoke it
as "cat txt | ./teesample out1 | wc ")
