OK, I've done quite a lot more work on this. It isn't 2.4.5, I'd 
compiled USB support in when I went to 2.4.5 and it's that that causes
the problems. I backed out all changes made between 2.4.2 and 2.4.5 in
drivers/pcmcia and that made no difference to the lockup so then I 
went back to the .config file from 2.4.2 and that worked.
My best guess is that the USB support is using IRQ 11 and that the 
PCMCIA card sockets are wired to use that as well. I have a bypass for
now - if I set the Toshiba BIOS up to use the slots in PCIC mode then 
it assigns them IRQ 15. In cardbus mode they get assigned IRQ 11 in 
Win9x but dmesg reports
Linux Kernel Card Services 3.1.22                                     
                                            
  options:  [pci] [cardbus] [pm]                                      
                                            
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:06.0. Please try 
using pci=biosirq.                             
PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin B of device 00:06.1. Please try 
using pci=biosirq.
and
Yenta IRQ list 0eb8, PCI irq0
Socket status: 30000007
Yenta IRQ list 0eb8, PCI irq0
Socket status: 30000007
Using pci=biosirq makes no difference when in cardbus mode.
Ah, got it, flipping the PCMCIA setup in the BIOS from "Auto-detect" 
to "Cardbus/16 bit" fixes it. lspci -vv now lists the cardbus ports as
having IRQ 11 assigned (instead of 0 before). Everything (famous last 
words) appears to be working.
