also, in theory we've got a pretty reliable set of the following 
information:
  function X references symbol Y
and we know what type of sections they are in, right?
could -ffunction-sections be used to delay the categorization of 
functions to the link stage, and in essence remove the need to mark 
functions via any of the __init markers?
