Most of this is Lindent changes. The only mod is we need pci_root_ops to be non-static.

As a general comment, the changes to these files are because of mods in the reorg code - so they are 
needed for this base but not in the older code. So, in my mind, it is a package - or should be taken 
as a whole. I can break them out, but I think they need to go together.

This is Jesse's code. We made an include file change. Is this OK Jesse ?

This is Greg Howard's code - he's reviewed and approved the mod. Should I add him as a signed-off ?

More Lindent mods. We took out the endian code - not needed anymore.

Took out SGI PCI Hotplug. Since there isn't any code behind it - we will add it back in when we 
submit the code for it.

Again more Lindent mods. Took out the vchan definition hack.

This is my driver.
