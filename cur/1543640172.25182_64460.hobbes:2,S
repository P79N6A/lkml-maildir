No, there's nothing wrong.
The process _itself_ never sees these magic error numbers, because they
are internal to the kernel, and the only time they are seen is by a
tracer that sees them - at the same time as the kernel backed up the
instruction pointer so that the traced process will not actually return
from the system call, it will re-do the system call.
