Hi Joerg,
I am unable to duplicate this bug that supposedly exists even on older
kernels.
For instance, on a 2.6.16 kernel I do the following:
$ mkisofs -R -v -o rrtest.iso testiso
mkisofs 2.01.01a18 (i686-pc-linux-gnu)
Scanning testiso
Scanning testiso/d3
Scanning testiso/f2

$ mount rrtest.iso testmount -t iso9660 -o loop=/dev/loop0
Examining testmount/ I find everything there that should be there.
dmesg even reports:
ISO 9660 Extensions: RRIP_1991A
So it is indeed using RockRidge of some sort.
(If there is something I'm doing wrong here, please point it out so I can find
this bug).
I do agree that any implementation should not need to know about the new
version in order to function in 1.10 mode. However, in order to support the
new fields, in this case assigning inode->i_ino from the new PX entry field, it
must know that the record is a v. 1.12 one.
Thanks.
