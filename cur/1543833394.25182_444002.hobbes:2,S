Mostly because I fear it would become another udev like disaster, requiring user 
space updates regularly, and core dumps are a fairly critical debugging feature
that I wouldn't like to become unreliable.
That said extended core dumping (e.g. automatic processing of the output) 
in user space makes sense. I had a prototype for that once that uploaded
a simple crash report to a web page.
