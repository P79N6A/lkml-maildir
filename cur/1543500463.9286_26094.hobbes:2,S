Subject: Hard Drive corruption in 2.2.x

I have an EPOX MPV3 motherboard, I have not seen this corruption in
later 2.2.x kernels.  There is something I have to say that might help
answer some of the problems.
I do not know if the patch that changed drive geometry that people were
still having is present or not.  I had a spare machine, not entirely
like this one, different hard drive, basically the same motherboard and
memory configuration, different video, no sound, no cd, no scsi.
Point:  This other computer... it experienced messages similar to those
showing hard rive corruption.  I have NEVER used quota.  I tracked this
down to some oddities in translations that don't entirely work
together.  Some people may need to back up, repartition (completely
including Windows whatever if you have it) and reinstall.
I am not sure I had corruption on that machine, it was entirely
expendable data at that point and I fixed it by doing what I just
suggested.  I would purpose that Alan Cox (since he is conducting the
survey/investigation) would ask people their translations, and if the
one linux reported is different than the one the bios reports.  If it
does, this may be the problem.
Anyway, just a thought since the pattern of those messages seems to have
been built.
