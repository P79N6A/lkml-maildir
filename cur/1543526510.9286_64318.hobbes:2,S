Security thru obscurity never works in long run. A dumb administrator may be
not able to break your encryption scheme but think about him as about a script
kiddie - a somewhat smarter guy could write a tool for catching passwords when
your software becames more known.
On the other hand using PGP on a large server with 5 people having root access
is a quite similar aproach. I can trust them to some extent and hope they have
many more interesting things to do.
