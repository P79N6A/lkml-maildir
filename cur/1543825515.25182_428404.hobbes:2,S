why is this bad?
this lets the user of the box use as much as is needed, from plain text 
mode on up to accelerated modes. perfect for the user who sometimes needs 
a nimple, stripped down system and sometimes needs graphics (and if they 
need graphics it seems silly to deny them access to the accelerated 
features)
