In addition, there's some slanted statistics being done here by Hedding....

Hmm.. Zorn is an author 20 times, Aboba 16 (usually with Zorn), Huitema 15.
And of those 102, at least 8 are documenting Microsoft-specific things like its
CHAP and Kerberos extensions. So leave them out of the count, and we see that
just 2-3 guys are a third of it right there.  And Microsoft employs how many
people?  That's some *HUGE* dent in their manpower supply....
Meanwhile, looking in the MAINTAINERS file, I see 343 M: tags, of which
only 12 are redhat.com addresses (and only 7 unique ones at that). And
Redhat isn't primarily a development company, they're a packaging company.
The vast amount of Linux development would be elsewhere - it would be
fairer to compare RedHat's RFC output with the RFC output of Microsoft's
packaging and shipping department.....
Now how many RFC's has Ted T'so  written? And how much has he done for Linux?
Of course, he doesn't use a redhat.com address, so he doesn't count...
Naughty thing, those statistics - people keep trying to misuse them. ;)
