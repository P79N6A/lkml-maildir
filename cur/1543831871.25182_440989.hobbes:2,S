Randy I'll apply this for now, thanks.
The DMA stuff I want to do differently, but that won't happen
for a few days as I'm still on vacation until Friday.
The idea is to move the SBUS stuff over to the of_driver stuff
the sparc64 port has, and thus make it use the dma_*() interfaces
in the SBUS drivers instead of the SBUS specific DMA mapping
calls the drivers use now.
This will allow drivers which support a chip on both PCI and SBUS
(for example sunhme and one of the ATM drivers) to be done much
more cleanly.
