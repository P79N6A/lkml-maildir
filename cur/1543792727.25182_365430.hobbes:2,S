Just to extract some useful technical knowledge from the current ongoing
"flamewar"...
I'm not entirely sure if the above statement regarding performance is
correct. Some enlightenment would be appreciated.
Suppose you have the following code:
	int myvar;
	void foo (void) {
		printf("%d\n", myvar);
		bar();
		printf("%d\n", myvar);
	}
If bar is declared in _another_ file as
	void bar (void);
then I believe the compiler has to reread the global 'myvar' from memory
for the second printf().
However, if the code is as follows:
	void foo (void) {
		int myvar = 0;
		printf("%d\n", myvar);
		bar(&myvar);
		printf("%d\n", myvar);
	}
If bar is declared in _another_ file as
	void bar (const int * var);
then I think the compiler can validly cache the value of 'myvar' for the
second printf without re-reading it. Correct/incorrect?
