I started this thread by posting an idea I had for shrinking the kernel by 
allowing more code to be configured out.  The API change was exactly one new 
parameter, with a direct 1->1 mapping from the old API to the new one, which 
was trivial to convert and which the compiler would catch if you missed one.
The result of the discussion is a patch adding 1600 lines to the kernel, 
without removing anything.
Last I checked, the current prink() worked just fine.  Why is this _not_ the 
dreaded "infrastructure in search of a use"?  What exactly can we _not_ do 
with the current code?  What does this allow us to remove and simplify?
I'm confused about what people are trying to accomplish here...
