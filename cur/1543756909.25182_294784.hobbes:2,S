Actually, that isn't necessarily true.  If the request_regions call fails,
that can mean there's a resource conflict.  If so, leaving the device
enabled is the worst possible thing to do as we'll now have two devices
trying to respond to the same io accesses.

conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
