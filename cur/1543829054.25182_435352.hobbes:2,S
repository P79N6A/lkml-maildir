Subject: [PATCH -mm 1/6] cpu_relax(): interrupt.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/6/21/401

Add cpu_relax() to tasklet_unlock_wait() loop.
I kept barrier() since it is said to still be required, in various older
postings.
Took care of kernel style formatting.
Tested on 2.6.17-mm1.
This is the first patch within a set, which aims to improve P4 HT performance
a bit:
these SMT CPUs want a rep nop (pause) (as done by cpu_relax()) when
busy-polling, in order to free pipeline resources for the SMT CPU sibling.
During I/O polling cpu_relax() will help for non-P4 CPUs, too (reduce
power consumption there).
