It's not.  It's "Linux".  And anyway, sysadmin may set whatever
owner/group/permissions on '/dev/fuse' to disallow or selectively
allow users to be able to mount FUSE filesystems.

Not true.  Root squash in NFS has similar effect.

I assure you, that it will cause no problems whatever.  These programs
are able to gracefully handle errors.

How would you do that?

Yeah, that's your opinion.  Mine is that it's f****** beautiful ;).
There are plenty of ugly things in Unix/Linux that you've become so
accustomed to, that they no longer seem ugly.  Think about the sticky
bit on directories for example.  That one was breaking assumptions
left and right when it got introduced, but people came to accept it,
because it's useful.

That's because I don't see any alternative.  The "preventing user from
tracing root" and "preventing access to user's filesysem by root" must
come together.  There's doesn't seem to be any other way.
BTW, thanks for reading through fuse.txt :)
