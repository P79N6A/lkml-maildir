   Anyone who really needs this kind of support is probably going to end up 
   writing their own driver which uses the serial port hardware directly, like 
   the irport one already does.
We have such an interface already; it's the line discpline.  Granted
it's doesn't have the right hooks for a half-duplex device driver, but
it's probably not that hard to put those hooks in.
I'd rather try to expand the line discpline to have the right interfaces
for those sorts of protocols, than try to invent a new interface in
addition to the line discpline structure; it's a matter of what's the
cleanest way of doing things.  Also, that way it's much more likely to
work with other tty device drivers (although it'll probably require a
few changes to each driver to support calling the line discpline when
hardware transmit buffer is empty, and so on).
