I realize I was not explicit, and dit not answer your question (Lost forever 
means ?)
                 if (epi->revents) {
                         if (__put_user(epi->revents,
                                        &events[eventcnt].events) ||
                             __put_user(epi->event.data,
                                        &events[eventcnt].data))
                                 return -EFAULT;
 >>                        if (epi->event.events & EPOLLONESHOT)
 >>                                epi->event.events &= EP_PRIVATE_BITS;
                         eventcnt++;
                 }
If one EPOLLONESHOT event is correctly copied to user space, its status is 
updated.
If other ready events in the same epoll_wait() call cannot be transferred 
because of an EFAULT (we reach the real end of user provided area), this 
EPOLLONESHOT event is lost forever, because it wont be requeued in ready list.
