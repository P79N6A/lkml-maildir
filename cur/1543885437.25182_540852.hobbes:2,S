The simple triggers are often tagged onto other subsystems and were
designed to be minimally invasive. Since they were ancillary, it was
left that they didn't return error codes. Taking the IDE trigger as an
example, the failure of the trigger should not cause the IDE subsystem
to fail, if should just skip over the LED registration. The alternative
is every simple trigger site has an error check and a printk which
seemed a bit pointless.
Note that you can still check whether it succeeded by looking at the
trigger pointer if you really need to - I've never seen a use case that
did though.
Moving to the problem you raised, I thought all the code paths a simple
trigger could end up on checked for NULL and/or were NULL safe. The
led_trigger_unregister_simple function has a missing NULL check which
I'll fix.

I agree the failure shouldn't be silent as it currently is and therefore
led_trigger_register_simple() should have some warning printks added so
the user can tell if it failed to register. I think they belong in the
core rather than at every call site though for the reasons I mention
above.
