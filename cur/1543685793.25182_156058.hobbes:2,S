I looked at the assembly (ppc, gcc 3.2.3) and didn't
see any overhead.
Note that the kernel code is broken for the likely()
macro, since 42 is a perfectly good truth value in C.

The !!x gives you a 0 or 1 while converting the type.
So a (char*)0xfda9c80300000000ull will become a 1 of
an acceptable type, allowing the macro to work as desired.
