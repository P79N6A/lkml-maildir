Anyone tried booting a  recent Toshiba Laptop from PCMCIA?
I have, and it doesn't work. Not that this necessarily has anything to do
with the IDE code. I have tried both recent -ac and vanilla.     
In short, if I load the kernel from PCMCIA, the CardBus slots disappear
from the PCI bus. -> no root device -> boom!
If I load the kernel from any other medium (haven't tried PCMCIA netboot),
the CardBus slots are present.
Is this a Toshiba oddity for which there isn't a PCI quirk yet?
Any suggestions for debugging?
