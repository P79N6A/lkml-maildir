What, with a "covers everything" choice like "something else"? ;)
But to confirm:  you're saying there's no particular reason not to
use it pretty generally?  (Or at least, no known reason?)
I'd mostly be concerned about potential bridge/cpu chipset problems,
since those are the class of problems I'd have very little chance
of noticing, with only a handful of test platforms.  If individual
devices have broken MWI it'd be easy for them not to enable it.
But if they have to cope with buggy platform implementations...
I suppose the potential for broken PCI devices is exactly why MWI
isn't automatically enabled when DMA mastering is enabled, though
I don't understand why the cacheline size doesn't get fixed then
(unless it's that same issue).  Devices can use the cacheline size
to get better Memory Read Line/Read Multiple" throughput; setting
it shouldn't be tied exclusively to enabling MWI.

Yep, I noticed that it grew from acenic.  Didn't check back too many
kernel revs though, I guess "new" is relative ... 2.4 and 2.5 both
have it today.

Actually I sort of prefer having the extra logic (set cacheline size,
twiddle that bit) out of drivers; there's no reason to have two copies
of that, particularly given there's already one arch-specific tweak.
Not that it's complex code, but it's easier for driver writers to
just know "call pci_set_mwi() if you're using DMA, unless you know
the hardware is buggy in that way" than to replicate its logic.
