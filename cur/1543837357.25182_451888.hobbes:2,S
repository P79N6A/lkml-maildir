What if kprobe_lookup_name() fails or if CONFIG_KALLSYMS isn't set?  The
code following this might work, but the kprobe isn't going to be set at
the location that was intended.
Perhaps this needs something like:
	if (p->symbol_name) {
		if (p->addr)
			return -EINVAL;
		p->addr = kprobe_lookup_name(p->symbol_name) + p->offset;
		if (p->addr == p->offset)
			return -EINVAL;
	}
