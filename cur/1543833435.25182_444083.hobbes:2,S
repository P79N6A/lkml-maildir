There's no problem providing a better replacement, just make sure

That's a statement designed to provoke arguments, and I'll just leave
it that we disagree.

There's really nothing special at all about the interrupt
setup, except in one very minor way.   The value of the HT interrupt
destination address needs to be copied from HT config space, to
an internal chip register (which is, can, and should be, handled by
the driver init code).

There is nothing unusual or special about that part at all.  The only
unusual item is that mentioned in the paragraph above.

Huh?  I didn't say anything that could possibly be read as applying
to earlier kernels, and to be crystal clear, that's not my concern
at all.
Maybe somebody else can articulate what I'm trying to say, but I don't
think I can say it in a clearer way.
