I fail to see why dev_stop(device) is better than suspend(device,
PM_PLEASE_QUIESCE_OR_WHATEVER). It has one big advantage: drivers that
ignore second argument (most do) will automagically work.
There is no fundamental problem with dev_stop/dev_start, I just fail
to see why they need to be separate from suspend/resume.
