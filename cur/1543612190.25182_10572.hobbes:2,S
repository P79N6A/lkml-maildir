Hi Ingo,
	Hmm... there are some ugly hoops there to make sure that they don't
conflict with bottom halves or cli().  I assume you want to take that out:
what will break if that happens, and do we need a disable_timers() interface
to move code over?
Cheers,
Rusty.
PS.  Also would be nice to #define del_timer del_timer_sync, and have a
     del_timer_async for those (very few) cases who really want this.
