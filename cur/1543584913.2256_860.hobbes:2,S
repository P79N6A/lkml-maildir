What about if I want to know the mountpoint (inside the filesystem)
when it is mounted?  The comments in the code say sb->s_type->kern_mnt
is only valid for in-kernel filesystems (FS_SINGLE).
Would it be possible to put a valid vfsmnt pointer in kern_mnt for
non-FS_SINGLE filesystems?  Would only the vfsmnt information (maybe
d_path(kern_mnt, kern_mnt->mnt_mountpoint, buf, buflen)) be enough
to determine the pathname of the filesystem mount point?
Cheers, Andreas
