IMNSHO.... not really :)  If you want that type of feature, you should
make yourself a helper function instead
	extern inline mj_writeb (u8 val, unsigned long phys_addr) {
		void *addr = ioremap (phys_addr, 1);
		if (addr) {
			writeb (val, addr);
			iounmap (addr);
		}
	}
Using isa_xxx during init code is not a good idea because it encourages
assumptions which are not portable.  isa_xxx just happens to work with
32-bit PCI memory, for example, but (IIRC) it will not work on anywhere
but x86.
