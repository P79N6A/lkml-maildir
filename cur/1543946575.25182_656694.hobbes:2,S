Thanks very much Yanmin, I think we can apply your patch as is, if no 
regression was found for 32bits.

No, thank you, that was an experiment and is not related to your findings on 
dst_entry.
I am currently working on a 'distributed refcount' infrastructure, to be able 
to spread on several nodes (for NUMA machines) or several cache lines (normal 
SMP machines)  the high pressure we currently have on some refcnt (struct 
dst_entry, struct net_device, and many more refcnts ...)
Instead of NR_CPUS allocations, goal is to be able to restrict to a small 
value like 4, 8 or 16 the number of 32bits entities used to store one refcnt, 
even if NR_CPUS=4096 or so.
atomic_inc(&p->refcnt) ->  distref_inc(&p->refcnt)
distref_inc(struct distref *p)
{
	atomic_inc(myptr[p->offset]);
}
