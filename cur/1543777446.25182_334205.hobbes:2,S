So... instead of providing nice & standard interface, you invent very ugly interface
that allows your usermode app to band on SMI directly -- because you don't want
to tell us how to drive SMI.
No, sorry. Provide something with standard interface (like lm_sensors use). You'll have to
tell us how to control the hardware. Its temperature sensor; I don't see how that is worh calling
"proprietary"...
