Nope... the terminations are correct... these are previously running systems...
not new installs... they have had numerous Linux installs... the problem arose
with RH 5.2 and is still extant with 6.0. Also, I think it's important to note
that if you do a web search for incidences of failure of this card you will find
thousands of people complaining about the very same error and notably, the
majority do not appear to have been resolved.

I have a test machine in place which is going to be used to resolve this
issue... I am deliberately *not* going to change the hardware on it so that we
can fix this bug. The test machine has been running NT4.0 for the last two years
24x7 without a hitch (so plz don't ask me to start checking termination issues
on it... NT would not run at all if there were termination problems).

On my other "production system" (my wife's WS really) we've moved to an 2920C
which uses the aic7xxx driver.

I agree it's old but a lot of people are still using it (including me and
several others on this list). FWIW we run a small office and don't need huge SMP
boxen to do our work so we really see no need to go out and spend a bazillion
$'s on new hardware unless it's absolutely necessary.
Thanx for the thoughts!
