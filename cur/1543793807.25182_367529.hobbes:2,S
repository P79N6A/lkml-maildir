SLIP is a line discipline; it's reference counting happens through
tty_register_ldisc() but probably your code isn't a line discipline ...
You however might use the platform device code - see
include/linux/platform_device.h and the many users throughout the kernel.
The platform device concept was really meant to support physical hardware
but it should work just fine in your case.  Maybe
drivers/net/mipsnet.c can serve as an example - it's a driver for virtual
NIC on a software emulator.
