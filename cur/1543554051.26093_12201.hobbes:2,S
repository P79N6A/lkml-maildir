Not a bug... possibly a typo though. The "[/tmp/old] mv . ../new" line
destroys the definition of "current directory". The "mkdir fff" can't work
since the current directory is no longer there, and is indicated by
the lines:
     [/tmp/old] ls -la
     total 0                         (?)
There is nothing to take a directory of.
