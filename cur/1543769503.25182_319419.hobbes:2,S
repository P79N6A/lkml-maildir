First off, I think we need a system-call that will return some of
the information that now comes from headers. PAGE_SIZE comes to
mind. You need this for mmap() but there doesn't seem to be any
way to get it. getpagesize() 'C' library just returns something
it's swiped from kernel headers when the library was compiled.
There are other things like the following that sometimes need
to be known also.
 	HZ
 	TASK_SIZE
 	SMP
 	MAXHOSTNAMELEN
 	_NSIG
 	Number of errno values
 	Highest ioctl value used
 	A default 'struct termios'
These things are gotten from 'kernel' headers used when the
'C' runtime library was built. They can all change. If these
and others were returned all at once in a structure, then
the 'C' runtime library could make a single call during
initialization and have the correct information for the
existing kernel.
