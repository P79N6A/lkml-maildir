Well... It's a common suggestion not to duplicate code. The wm97xx bus
looks mostly like platform. The only difference is the name. To help
visualisation, devices can have parents. Just set (in pseudocode)
wm97xx-touchscreen->parent to wm97xx, do the same for wm97xx-battery
and so on. Thus all devices would be on the platform device but with
proper parent <-> child notation.

You can find the current work at
git://git.mnementh.co.uk/linux-2.6-im.git#tmio_dev_try3. Look for
"Core MFD support" changeset.

This would only touch child devices organisation.
