Well, most developer don't care about older hardware anymore, on recent 
hardware it's indeed a nonissue, so I'm not really suprised nobody 
complained.
For me the patch is important enough that it should be seriously 
considered for 2.6.16 and not just rejected like this. Sorry, that I'm a 
bit late, but the hrtimer was merged without warning and I can't just drop 
everything to fix other people's code.
bye, Roman
