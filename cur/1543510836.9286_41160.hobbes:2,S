Subject: The limitation of scsi target and lun supported under Linux?

Folks,
Linux scsi support has max_id and max_lun defined in Scsi_Host structure.
Both of them are defined as "unsigned int" which is a 4 byte value.
Does Linux really be able to support defined bit number of device?
max_id could be 2^31 = 2G, and max_lun could be the same.
If not, what is the max supported scsi target id and lun?
Many thanks!
