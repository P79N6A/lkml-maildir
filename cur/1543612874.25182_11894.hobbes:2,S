At the very least, please pass this paraphrase on to the Intel people.
I asserted:
	If you number each CPU so its two IDs are smp_num_cpus()/2
	apart, you will NOT need to put some crappy hack in the
	scheduler to pack your CPUs correctly.

I apologize: clearly my previous post was far too long, as you
obviously did not read it.  There is no sched.c patch.
> For 2.5 the scheduler needs a rewrite anyway so its a non issue there.
Disagree.  Without widespread understanding of how the simple
scheduler works, writing a more complex one is doomed.
The Intel people, whom you assure me "know what their chip needs"
obviously have trouble understanding the subtleties of the current
scheduler.  What hope the rest of us?
Rusty.
PS.  Alan, go back and READ what my analysis, or this will be a VERY
     long thread.
