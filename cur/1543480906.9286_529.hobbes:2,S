You are further in the process than I am.  I do not have framebuffer
configured, so no tux, but otherwise my 2.2.0-pre8 kernel (a "generic"
one) detects ATAPI CDROM and stops. The next thing should be a floppy and
SCSI controller only after that.  Never happens.  Keyboard still works -
at least to an extent that ALT-CTL-DEL reboots my machine (how?).
The last one which I can get to boot is 2.2.0-pre7-ac4.  Later "ac"
apparently did something to select().
