BTW I wonder if its feasible to add an interface on top of kernel/irq/spurious.c for 
notifying drivers about interrupts storms, so they can take appropriate action 
(try to reset the device).
For example I've seen a 8390 based pcnet_cs driven (Linksys EtherFast 10/100+ + 56K Modem) PCMCIA
card go nuts and trigger infinite interrupt storms on custom PowerPC hardware under certain situations, 
and resetting the device after a high limit of bogus interrupts "brought the hardware back", stabilizing
the system.
Would be nice to be able to change the current hardcoded nr-of-interrupt limits, and 
have a notification mechanism.
Not sure if this kind of problem is common enough that adding a generic API 
is worth it, though ?
