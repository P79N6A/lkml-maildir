Subject: [PATCHSET] printk: implement printk_header() and merging printk, take #3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello, all.
This is the third take of implement-printk_header-and-mprintk
patchset.
Changes from the last take[L] are...
* Now header is printed on every line of a multiline message.  If the
  header ends with ':' followed by spaces.  The colon is replaced with
  space from the second line.
* s/mprintk/mprintk_flush/ and s/mprintk_add/mprintk/ as suggested.
* mprintk_init_alloc() and mprintk_free() added to ease malloc'd
  buffer handling.  No need to specify buffer size.  Sizing is left to
  mprintk.
This patchset aims to make printing multiline messages and assembling
message piece-by-piece easier.
In a nutshell, printk_header() lets you do the following atomically
(against other messages).
 code:
  printk(KERN_INFO "ata1.00: ", "line0\nline1\nline2\n");
 output:
  <6>ata1.00: line0
  <6>ata1.00  line1
  <6>ata1.00  line2
And mprintk the following.
 code:
  DEFINE_MPRINTK(mp, 2 * 80);
  mprintk_set_header(&mp, KERN_INFO "ata%u.%2u: ", 1, 0);
  mprintk_push(&mp, "ATA %d", 7);
  mprintk_push(&mp, ", %u sectors\n", 1024);
  mprintk(&mp, "everything seems dandy\n");
 output:
  <6>ata1.00: ATA 7, 1024 sectors
  <6>ata1.00  everything seems dandy
For more info, please read Documentation/printk.txt which is created
by the fourth patch.
This patchset is on top of
  linux-2.6#master (96b5a46e2a72dc1829370c87053e0cd558d58bc0)
+ printk-fix-possible-printk-buffer-overrun [1]

If this gets acked, I think it's best to push it through libata-dev as
libata is the first user.
Thanks.
