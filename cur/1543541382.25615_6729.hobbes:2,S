What, another one? Doesn't Linux already have all filesystems one can
imagine ? :)
Seriously though, the way to go is probably to print out sources of two
filesystems: ramfs (fs/ramfs/inode.c) and minix (fs/minix/*.c +
include/linux/minix*.h) and study their interaction with buffer cache and
page cache and VFS. If you are brave and are not afraid of huge complexity
of ext2 replace minix -> ext2 above.
How I wrote bfs - I just read fs/minix/*.c (you can notice it by reading
fs/bfs/*.c) and mimicked it wherever I could to get readonly version
working quickly. Then, the hard part was to understand how ->get_block()
method is supposed to work and implement the full write support. But bfs
is a very simple filesystem, for most cases you need a lot more things to
think about...
