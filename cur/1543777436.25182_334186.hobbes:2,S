I believe all of these cases represent what we would consider to be
protocol errors.  I suppose it is possible that our truncation
approach could be used as an exploit in some weird case -- I'll take a
look at fixing things so that any such overflow case is treated as a
fatal protocol error and reported as such (via the protocol as
appropriate).
