/usr/bin/finger @ftp.kernel.org 
produces the following:
[zeus.kernel.org]
    The latest stable version of the Linux kernel is:     2.2.14
    The latest beta version of the Linux kernel is:       2.3.39
    The latest prepatch (alpha) version *appears* to be:  2.3.40-4
I run that command as a daily cron job to keep up with what is current.
