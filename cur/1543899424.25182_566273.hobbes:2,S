Well, fix userspace filesystems and maybe NFS. If they react to
sigstop in timely manner, they will work with suspend properly, too.

Nice way to have useful discussion. Not.
Look, Linux was not designed with malicious filesystems in mind. In
particular, suspend was not designed with malicious filesystems in
mind, and VFS was not designed with malicious filesystems in mind.
That's why you have the nastiness with deadlocks... which you are
unable/unwilling to solve because you'd have to redesign VFS and meet
Al Viro.
Now.. freezer already includes timeout; if some part of kernel knows
nothing about suspend or had crashed, it will abort after some time,
telling you which part to blame. Another timeout for detecting
malicious userspace filesystems will not hurt much in this old house.
(Maybe you don't want to auto abort them, just tell user what happened.
We are stuck with refrigerator for now, and at least for hibernation,
I don't see any feasible alternative.
And now, can we get that sysrq-t trace? Dealing with 'unable to
freeze' may be hard, but the deadlock Matthew saw should be simple bug
for us to fix.

I'm talking malicious _filesystems_ here, and yes, fuse is first of
this kind. We want to handle unresponding NFS, but I believe handling
malicious NFS server nicely is slightly out of scope.

Anything that's used in today's notebooks, I'd say...
