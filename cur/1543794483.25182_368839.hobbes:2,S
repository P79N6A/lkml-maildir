Well, without my changes, an attacker can scribble over random bits of
memory, too; I was not the one that introduced /dev/mem :-).

Can I read somewhere about security model you are using? Would it be
enough to restrict /dev/[k]mem to those people that have right to
update kernel anyway? Or your approach is "noone, absolutely noone has
right to modify running kernel"? [Do you still use loadable modules?]
