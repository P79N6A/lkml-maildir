Long ago there was a real bug in this area which caused these GART 
errors legitimately, but even what that one was fixed they still 
occurred occasionally.
I was told back then that there was a bug in the Northbridge
that causes them occasionally - that is why BIOS turn them off.
The kernel did that eventually too.
Of course there is some probability that you have a driver
that accesses the buffers after unmapping. The GART is currently
not flushed on unmapping because that would be 
Normally such drivers are caught though because some other IOMMU
implementations on other architectures have stronger checking in this area.
