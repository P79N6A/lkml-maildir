Okay, all of these fixes it.
console=ttyS0,38400n8 console=tty0
console=tty1
console=tty0
But still, switching back from X to console corrupts the display. 
Switching back is fine though using the fbdev.diff patch. Without 
switching back and force works fine, except that the last line isn't 
properly redrawn (rivafb).
Thanks, jan
