Actually, I have a case right now. For us, a watchdog with minute  
granularity is just too long, but that is the only hardware watchdog  
available. So, we use softdog for finer granularity and the  
additional crappy hardware watchdog just to catch cases that softdog  
doesn't. I just wanted to pass along an example where more than one  
watchdog is needed for your consideration.
