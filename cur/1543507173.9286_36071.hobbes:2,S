The K6 at least assists in this by raising an interrupt if a process
accesses special registers one or more task switches.  Special registers
being MMX, FPU, and possibly 3Dnow registers.
It also sports SYSCALL and SYSRET instructions; I wonder if they would
provide any speed gain if used with Linux or compatibility syscalls.
