It is currently as fairly clean as the following, but this will probably
become worse later, IMO, if it not _really_ cleaned as it deserves:
./drivers/block/ide.c:				if (bdev->current_request != &bdev->plug)
./drivers/block/ide.c:				if (bdev->current_request != &bdev->plug)	/* FIXME: this will do for now */
./drivers/block/ide.c:		if (bdev->current_request == &bdev->plug)	/* FIXME: paranoia */
./drivers/block/ide.c:			printk("%s: Huh? nuking plugged queue\n", drive->name);
./drivers/block/raid5.c:static void unplug_devices(struct stripe_head *sh)
./drivers/block/raid5.c:		unplug_device(blk_dev + MAJOR(raid_conf->disks[i].dev));
./drivers/block/raid5.c:	int i, handled = 0, unplug = 0;
./drivers/block/raid5.c:					unplug = 1;
./drivers/block/raid5.c:				unplug = 1;
./drivers/block/raid5.c:			if (unplug) {
./drivers/block/raid5.c:				PRINTK(("unplugging devices, sector == %lu, count == %d\n", sh->sector, raid_conf->sector_count));
./drivers/block/raid5.c:				unplug_devices(sh);
./drivers/block/raid5.c:				unplug = 0;
Note that in the raid code, this fairly clean thing is just #ifed ZERO.
