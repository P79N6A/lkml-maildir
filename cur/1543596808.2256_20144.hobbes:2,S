The NFSv2 spec says no such thing. It simply says that you set the
cookie to zero when you want to start at the beginning of the
directory. This is only needed when we want to reread the directory
into the page cache.
Your patch will automatically lead to duplicate entries in readdir()
on most if not all servers whenever the attributes on the inode have
been refreshed (whether or not the cache has been invalidated). That's
a bug...
