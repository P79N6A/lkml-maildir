Upper 32-bit ([32:63]). On many implementations the only lower 32-bit are 
available in the register. the 32:40 bits in several processor implementation of 
x86 processors can not be set to bit outside of sign extension of bit 32. On 
other processor implementations the event counters are only 32-bit in width.

OProfile is very useful in many cases, but it only perform sampling. If one want 
to take a look at the number events a specific section of code causes, one can't 
really do that with oprofile. The counters are running systemwide, not per 
thread. For some experiments developers really like to have per thread counters.
The rewrite of oprofile to use the perfmon code was to consolidate code using 
the performance monitoring hardware. Use one interface for accessing the 
performance monitoring hardware rather than have one for sampling and another 
for virtualizing the counters on a per thread basis.

So the alternative approach is to write a new device driver for each of the new 
performance monitoring mechanisms, e.g. one for PEBS and another for IBS?
One of the reason for the custom sample buffers was to avoid having an expensive 
user-space signal for a process to record some simple pieces of data each time 
the data becomes available. For the oprofile port to the perfmon2 custom buffer 
  mechanism the instruction pointer and the counter that overflowed are 
recorded. The buffer can be processed in one large chunk by userspace, reducing 
overhead. In essence the current implementation of OProfile in the mainline 
kernels has a custom buffer mechanism.
