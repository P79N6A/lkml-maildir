I had the same problem with the integrated nic on a soyo k7vdragon+
search google/the archives for "via-rhine timeouts"
Try the linuxfet driver found here:
http://www.viaarena.com/?PageID=87#ethernet
http://downloads.viaarena.com/LinuxApplicationNotes/RedHat/May02/VIA
%20RH7.2-7.1%20Fast%20Ethernet%20Controller%20Driver%20Installation%20ver%200.9.gz
I've been using it since then without problems.  I had to change malloc.h or 
whatever it used to be to slab.h a few versions ago to make it compile 
without whining, but thats all.
