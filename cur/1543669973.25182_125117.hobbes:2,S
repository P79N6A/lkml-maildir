Hm, default looks good, but why would it have a .*?  How about:
for I in "${DIR}/$1/"* "${DIR}/"default/* ; do 
That way the programs that really care about only one subsystem can be
easily added, while everyone else can drop into the default directory
(which odds are, everyone will want to be in...)
Sound ok?

Damm, you s390 people, always showing everyone else up :)
Ok, I'll take the '&' out for now, and serialize things within a single
hotplug call.
