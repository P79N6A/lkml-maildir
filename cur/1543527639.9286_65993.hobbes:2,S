Both Digital and HP still make them, altho' with the Compaq/Digital thing
I'm not sure about Digital.  (VT-540's and up... full color, multi-input,
etc.  I know where there are several dozen brand new ones plugged onto
a DMS-500 :-))

The tty* <-> cu* is even worse.
And, for the record, I prefer an amber VT-420 to just about anything else.
I used one for four years -- with three Sony monitors beside of it;  I still
did everything on the VT.
A VT-420 and screen... that's all anyone ever needs. (Unless you want to play
quake or something.)
