Provided you're not making the data of the filesystem inconsistent with
the state that the suspended image is expecting to see, you won't get
any corruption. As to beginning a resume without rebooting, whether it
would work would depend upon the size of the image, the amount of memory
used when you start the resume and the degree of overlap between the two
sets of memory.

Nigel
