    It is the ultimate in hypocrisy to ask others for something you aren't 
    willing to do yourself.  I, for one, will remind you of this every time
    you bring up GNU/Linux in this list.
These two cases are similar, but not in the way you think.  In both
cases a large structure that is basically GNU or of GNU has a
component that is Linux or of Linux.
So why do we treat them differently?  In general, there's no ethical
obligation to cite each and every component of a larger structure in
the structure's name.  But in the case of "GNU/Linux" there are some
specific reasons why it is useful and proper to mention "Linux" in the
name.  See
