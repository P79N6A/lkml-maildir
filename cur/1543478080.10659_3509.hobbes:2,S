Subject: [PATCH(small)]: ptrace.c/print_child_state w/no stack
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

print_child_state() in ptrace.c produces a blank line if there's nothing
that ends up being printed on the stack, leading to a lot of syslog messages
like this if you're debugging:
Jan 15 17:01:19 cchiappa-pc1 kernel: Process: foo (stack=c6a5c000, 
task=c6a5a000)
Jan 15 17:01:19 cchiappa-pc1 kernel: 
This is somewhat irritating since the second line doesn't contain any useful
information.  Attached is a small patch which should eliminate the second
line by only printing the carriage return if we've printed something out.
