It's kind of tricky to figure out whether we can access the extended
config space or not.  Given that nobody checks the return value from
pci_read_config_*(), I don't know whether we'll be able to persuade them
to check pdev->cfg_size or not, but we can at least try to get it right.
/**
 * pci_cfg_space_size - get the configuration space size of the PCI device.
 *
 * Regular PCI devices have 256 bytes, but PCI-X 2 and PCI Express devices
 * have 4096 bytes.  Even if the device is capable, that doesn't mean we can
 * access it.  Maybe we don't have a way to generate extended config space
 * accesses, or the device is behind a reverse Express bridge.  So we try
 * reading the dword at 0x100 which must either be 0 or a valid extended
 * capability header.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
