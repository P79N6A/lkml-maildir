You speak about protocols (but there are also incompatible extention), but you 
know that there exists a lot o toolkit to handle http links...

better? More efficient yes. But you know... GNU/Linux comunity will start a long 
(more years) flameware to choose the best solution, the best protocol,...
so IMHO it is good that we have different toolkits (so I think less flames, more 
work). But I agree that in long period we should switch to one toolkit (as we 
switched (nearly) all to glibc, xfree86 (but yet a new fork?), gcc(egcs style),...
BTW IIRC the discuttion was about qt and gtk. IIRC the KDE and gnome comunities 
are approaching methods and protocols, so in future maybe we will have only one 
toolkit, but not to correct an "historical accident" but because evolution.
