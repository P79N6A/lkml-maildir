There are a number of processors that have 32-bit counters such as the IBM power 
processors. On many x86 processors the upper bits of the counter are sign 
extended from the lower 32 bits. Thus, one can only assume the lower 32-bit are 
available. Roll over of values is quite possible (<2 seconds of cycle count), so 
additional work needs to be done to obtain a valid value.

What range of cycles are you interested in measuring? 100's of cycles? A couple 
thousand? Are you just looking at cycle counts or other events?
