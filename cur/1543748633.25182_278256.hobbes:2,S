I am not sure I understand you correctly.
If it is a general method of making priority sorting on  wait-queues: Yes,
certainly! The highest priority task nearly always ought to be woken
first.
But in a lot of cases you send messages from high to low and visa verse
without wanting to move their priorities by doing so. If forinstance you
want a IRQ-thread to be increased in priority when a RT task listens to
packets from that device I think it is a bad idea. The developer should
himself set the priorities right. The device might use a lot of CPU in
some cases. By increasing it's priority you might destroy the RT
properties of all the tasks in between. In general you don't know.
