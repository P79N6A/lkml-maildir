I have a hard time distinguishing AppArmor's "model" from its
implementation; every time we suggest that one might emulate much of
AppArmor's functionality on SELinux (as in SEEdit), someone points to a
specific characteristic of the AppArmor implementation that cannot be
emulated in this manner.  But is that implementation characteristic an
actual requirement or just how it happens to have been done to date in
AA?  And I get the impression that even if we extended SELinux in
certain ways to ease such emulation, the AA folks would never be
satisfied because the implementation would still differ.  Can we
separate the desired functionality and actual requirements from the
implementation specifics?

I'd argue a bit with that characterization, given that:
- in the case of SELinux, the pathname is never used as a basis for
decisions by the kernel,
- under AA, each file may have an arbitrary set of "labels" or
"policies" applied to it depending on what programs are accessing it and
what names are being used to reference it - there is no system view of
the subjects and objects and thus no way to identify the overall system
policy for a given file.
- names are far less tranquil than labels.

Live file relabeling (non-tranquility) tends to break one's ability to
show anything about preservation of confidentiality or integrity
(particularly in the absence of complete revocation support).
On the new files issue, it wouldn't be difficult or even a real
divergence from our existing model to introduce the component name (not
a "full" pathname, but the last component) as an additional input to the
decision for labeling new files (along with the existing use of the
creating process' label, the parent directory label, and the kind of new
file) at creation time, and that would reduce the need somewhat to
modify some applications that create files of multiple security contexts
in the same directory.  That would further help the SEEdit folks in
emulating AA on top of SELinux, but as before, I don't get the
impression that the AA folks will ever be satisfied with such an
emulation, not because of any real requirement but merely because they
are tied to their implementation specifics.
