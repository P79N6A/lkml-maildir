or as Arjan points out, like the IBM x440 boxes ...
i think we want to handle SMT on a different level, ie. via the
shared-runqueue approach, so it's not a genuine new level of caching, it's
rather a new concept of multiple logical cores per physical core. (which
needs is own code in the scheduler.)
