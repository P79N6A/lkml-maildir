It's not clear if the association of the name (ethN) to the io address
changes or the association of the io address to the connector. If Ian
will clarify, and perhaps check the ifconfig after a few boots...
If it's the name to io address mapping, and I assume it is, then Nuno
has the right idea, an options statement in modules.conf or on a command
line. If it's the latter the the BIOS is NOT doing deterministic
assignment. That would show in lspci with -vv, I believe. You could
still fix this, but it would be ugly, parsing lspci output and building
a command line for insmod.
