I read that multicast loopback is by default enabled, and I have witnessed
this, when having my application bind to my ethernet interface, but the
datagrams do not seem to be looped back when I bind to the 'lo' interface.
Could this possibly be a conflict with the inherently 'looped back'
behavior of the loopback net driver?
As far as toggling the flag, or even reading it, I cannot, as I am
developing in Java.
For developing, I can easily kludge it to work, by adding a fake route
statement, forcing the packets back up to the application, but I want to 
make sure the differing behavior is not a bug in the kernel networking
code.
