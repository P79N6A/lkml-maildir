Even nicer.  On x86 change this:
reschedule:
	call SYMBOL_NAME(schedule)    # test
	jmp ret_from_sys_call
to this:
reschedule:
	orl $PF_HONOUR_LOW_PRIORITY,flags(%ebx)	
	call SYMBOL_NAME(schedule)    # test
	andl $~PF_HONOUR_LOW_PRIORITY,flags(%ebx)
	jmp ret_from_sys_call
(You get the idea; this isn't the best implementation).
I think this code can only be reached in two ways:
  1. An interrupt, exception, page fault etc. that is returning to user space.
  2. A system call, whatever space it's from.
In both these cases, no critical locks will be held, right?
