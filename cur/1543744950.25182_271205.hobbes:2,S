Hello,
menuconfig says this for CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK:
  |                                                                         |
  | Write kernel log output directly into the VGA buffer or to a serial     |
  | port.                                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  | This is useful for kernel debugging when your machine crashes very      |
  | early before the console code is initialized. For normal operation      |
  | it is not recommended because it looks ugly and doesn't cooperate       |
  | with klogd/syslogd or the X server. You should normally N here,         |
  | unless you want to debug such a crash.                                  |
So, why then is it default if it should better be N?
