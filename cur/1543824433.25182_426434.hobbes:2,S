Maybe No. I know ACPI people doesn't want to add special handling for cpu/memory
in a container. It complicates the code very much.

I want to allocate on-node. But it's impossible now because per-cpu-pages
has to be allocated at boot-time as for possible cpus. They has to be
off-node now. They are from node0 (ia64) now.
I want to migrate per-cpu when a cpu is enabled (if I can). But maybe there
is a code which has pointer to object in per-cpu area.

Yes. But per-cpu should be allocated at boot-time now. I'd like to go step-by-step.
