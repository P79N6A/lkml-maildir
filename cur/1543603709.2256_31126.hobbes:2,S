The select system call doesn't return EINTR when the signal is caught
prior to entry into select.
The problem is if you have a select loop and small signal handlers
setting flags for the loop, a signal could come in after the flag is
tested but before select is called. Instead of acting on this signal
right away, the process blocks in select.
The pselect system call offers a solution. The process blocks signals
in the select loop; pselect unblocks those signals and does a
select. The race condition mentioned earlier disappears: the signal
that arrives after the flag test is blocked. The pselect system call
unblocks the signal, so the deferred signal acts just like it arrived
while the process is blocked in select.

He just wants to handle signals properly 100% of the time.
