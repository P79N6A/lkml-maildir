You can't have "random" users scheduling thing at real-time priorities.
A real-time system can only work if it is set up as whole and all 
real-time tasks are taken into consideration. If you allow a user to start 
another real-time task, that task might destroy the real-time properties 
of all the rest by taking too much cpu.
As I see it the only thing you can do is to use sudo to run anything,
which needs real-time priority, with higher priviliges, than what a normal 
user have. Then he can only start specific audio programs and can't crash 
the system (unless those programs have a bug).
