Hi,
I've got several (about 5..7) of these machines running. One of them never worked,
so I guess the network interface is simply broken on this one.
For the others I've had some success with the de4x5 drivers.
tulip.c-0.89 - 0.90 never really worked successful.
tulip.c-0.91 gave me a link and pings, but I ended up with some data corruption,
which was fixed with 0.91e, so I don't trust the plain 0.91 too much.
Yesterday I had a machine that would get a link with both de4x5 and tulip0.91e,
but no ping packets got through. The debug option showed a transmit error on
each sent packet.
Strangely, the driver from 2.2.11 (the 0.89 with the additional hack) has the
machine up and running without problems since yesterday (kernel is 2.2.11,
the other end of the network-cable ends in a 3com workgroup-switch, so the
card probably does full duplex).
