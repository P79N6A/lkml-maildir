That's it.  BK is fairly subtle, it takes a while to wrap your brain around
it.  The way it works is hard to see from the outside and it is hard to see
the value.  So blind copying is more likely to copy the wrong parts.  On
the other hand, if I'm using BK every day and then working on a clone, it's
very easy to "do some unrelated work" to see how BK works.
