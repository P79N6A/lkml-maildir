Actually, this is one of Al's nicest posts :-)
You obviously can't share fd# but you can share file*
I don't know how you're going to have these semaphores 'externally visible',
if with numbers like IPC sems or if with pathnames like unix sockets ( or
something else ). But you can have internally a number/path/else -> file*
mapping and when a task attaches the sem you map the file* onto an fd# in
the task's file table. If you keep this mapping persistent ( until
explicit deletion ) the file* remain alive event with zero attached
processes. I think it's this what Al was trying to say.
