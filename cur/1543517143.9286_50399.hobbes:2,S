ok. Then having ioremap_nocache() is completely pointless, because the
MTRRs already say that those areas are UC. (this is a different issue, not
correctness but just interface cleanliness)

ok.

The interface will likely be an ioremap_relaxed() done by the driver? Then
we could have ioremap() which does the UC thing we always did. And remove
ioremap_nocache().
