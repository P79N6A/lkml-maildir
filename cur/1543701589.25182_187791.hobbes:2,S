literal zero is the end of the string.
So the code checks for resize= and not resize=0.
I think your fix is wrong because it would also recognize resize=0123
because it only tests the first character.
-           if (!resize || !*resize) {
+           if (!resize || !*resize || *resize=='0')
It should probably be
+           if (!resize || !*resize || (*resize=='0' && !resize[1]))
Or better: check the integer value that is returned by simple_strtoull.
But did you test what resize= does?
