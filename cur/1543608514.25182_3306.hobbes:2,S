Sis is quite good at writing Linux drivers and they release the source
under GPL - just search through google for bug reports for the sis900
network driver. 
And it's probably the only driver with a large list of the PHY's that
are used by the mobo manufacturers with the nic, and the various ways to
get at the correct negotiation result. That's something you won't be
able to write even with the sis datasheet.
Just wait a bit, or try to convince nvidia that they should release the
source of their driver if you want to do something now.
