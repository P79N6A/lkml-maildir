Actually I have a via/amd board:
00:00.1 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. K8M800 Host Bridge
00:01.0 PCI bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8237 PCI bridge 
[K8T800/K8T890 South]
01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. S3 Unichrome 
Pro VGA Adapter (rev 01)
Works well on FC4 with an Ubuntu driver.
