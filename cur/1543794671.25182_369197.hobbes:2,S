Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/3] move swiotlb header file into common code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/11/21/281

This patchset does two main things:
- creates an asm-generic/swiotlb.h header file and makes x86-64 and
IA64 both use it.
- make swiotlb use 'enum dma_direction_dir' instead of 'int dir',
which is the right thing to do in the DMA API, and updates x86-64 and
ia64 accordingly.
This is the first step towards having a common IOMMU
infrastructure. Unfortunatly applying any of the patches require the
other 2.
Compile tested on both x86-64 and IA64, I'll appreciate it if someone
knowledgable about IA64 could double check the IA64 bits.
Cheers,
Muli
