The graphs are really just to show where the new numbers fit in. Plus,
I was too lazy to run all the numbers again.

Interestingly, every set of lat_ctx -s 0 2 numbers I run on the
!PREEMPT kernel are on average higher than with PREEMPT (around 2.84
for !PREEMPT and 2.4 for PREEMPT). Anything higher than around 2 or 3
(such as lat_ctx -s 0 8) gives lower average numbers for !PREEMPT.
