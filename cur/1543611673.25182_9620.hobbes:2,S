As long as we will not have clean asynchronous mechanisms available from
user land, some applications will have to use more threads of execution
than needed, even with programmers that aren't thread-maniac.
Response to your question: If the problem is to optimize IOs against 8
slow devices using synchronous IO APIs , you will get far better
performances. :-)
