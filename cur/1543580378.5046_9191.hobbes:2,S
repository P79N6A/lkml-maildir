Hi!
1) You don't seem to have any drives on the VIA controller. If this is
true, I don't think this can be a VIA IDE driver problem.
2) In your original message you suggest bs=1024M, which isn't a very
good idea, even on a 768 MB system. Here with bs=1024k it seems to run
fine.
3) You sent next to none VIA related debugging info. lspci -v itself
isn't much valuable because I don't get the register contents. Also
hdparm -i of the drives attached to the VIA chip would be useful. Plus
also the contents of /proc/ide/via.
4) Did you check the problem you're experiencing isn't a memory problem?
That'd go away with removing some RAM.

PS. I'm not sure how wise is to use both ACPI and APM at once. Well, I
never used either in a server environment - I don't think it makes much
sense.
PPS. What should I do with a ksyms dump of the Advansys SCSI and a Tulip
NIC drivers? It isn't related anyhow.
