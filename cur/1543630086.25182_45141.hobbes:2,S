And how about when an SMP system isn't enough? Should I have to 
re-engineer my network storage architecture when hardware exists that'll 
increase throughput if a simple device driver gets written? Don't forget 
that with 64 bit PCI that the limit of the bus has been raised, and with 
impending technologies like Infiniband and Hypertransport that limit 
will be raised again. At that point devoting main processor resources to 
something better handled by specialty hardware really stops making 
sense, if that specialty hardware is low-cost (oughta be) and effective 
(still debatable).
