Huh?  Take a look at the drivers, this simply isn't true.  Do you have 
evidence that it will be true later?
Plus your code will be smaller doing a single writeb/readb loop than trying to 
do a switch statement.

You already do; the status register fills this role.  For example, you can't 
tell what features a guest understands until it updates the status register.
Hope that clarifies,
