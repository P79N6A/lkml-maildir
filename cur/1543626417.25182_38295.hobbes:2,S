Lately I have had my box freeze up just after connecting, although it
doesn't happen every time.. I am not sure exactly what the factors are
that make it crash. 
When I was having the freezes yesterday I watched syslog from a terminal
and wrote down some of the output on paper (I did a search in my syslog
file just now and it I don't have any of this... maybe because the data
was still in cache and didn't get written to disk?):

...this is where I stopped writing, was further debugging messages. They
would have been no use to me but at the time I wasn't considering
writing to this list, now I am thinking maybe they would have been
useful... I got a bit more of the messages though:
--
Code: Bad EIP value.
<0>Kernel panicL Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
--
I also noticed a weird startup message, although I have no idea whether
this is related:
--
/etc/init.d/rc: line 6: 180 Segmentation fault $debug "$@"
--
One other message I see in syslog a few times, and also am not sure
whether it is related:
--
pppd[357]: Cannot determine ethernet address for proxy ARP
--
Has anyone had similar problems? I asked around a bit on IRC and I was
recommended to try asking on this list.
