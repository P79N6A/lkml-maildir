Hi,
We bought a Dell Poweredge 1300 w/ dual PIII-500 & 256M ram, and have had
problems with 'sudden death' - it reboots immediately and reports an error
along the lines of 'Memory error or NMI'.  I don't see anything in
/var/log/messages thats helpful.  I tried the stock RH61 smp kernel, then
2.3.38ish, and finally 2.2.15pre13. 
I booted 2.2.15pre13smp on Saturday, and then floodpinged the machine (we
think it's interrupt related), and it stayed steady untill today when a
student went to make a tarball of /home. (the aic7xxx equivalent of a
floodping?)  Took the sucker right down.
Instead of attaching 4 random files/logs/outputs, if anyone is interested
in this problem I'd be happy to test whatever you like and send whatever
outputs to whatever commands.  The only interesting features of this
machine: using Intel Etherexpress pro100b (included from Dell) and Dell's
onboard aic7xxx w/ 2 harddrives, this machine is nfs server for /home.
regards,
	David
