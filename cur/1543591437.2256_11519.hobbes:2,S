I've got it to compile (and apparently work) even con libdb3... which
has the compability header db_185.h (or something similar).
IIRC, libdb1 was bundled with libc till release 2.1.3. Since 2.2 they've
said 'get it at sleepycat...'.
BTW, there are ifdef inside the driver about which header to include
(db.h or db_185.h IIRC).
I still doesn't comprend what does it NEED FOR the libdb...
