[Caveat: I'm not much of a kernel hacker.]
My only concern with kbuild 2.5 was the lack of modversions,
but since Richard is promising to add them in before the
distros need them, I would have no qualms about kbuild 2.5
totally replacing the old build system for the next 2.5 kernel.
I'm sick and tired of 'make dep'.
