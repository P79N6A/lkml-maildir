It's not wrong, but it shouldn't help. Simply because "task_lock()"  
isn't even relevant to "task->sighand" as it stands now. It will be 
cleared without holding the task lock, as far as I can see.
So I suspect it fixes things for Martin only because it changes timings 
enough not to hit the race.
