Exactly.  It was removed because no one was using it, and I couldn't
think of a reason why it would be needed.
Also, any reason why your drivers aren't in the mainline kernel yet?  It
would have kept something like this from happening a while ago.  And, it
will also help out with the recent driver core changes that are being
planned and are starting to show up in the -mm tree.  If your stuff is
in the kernel, then I'll do the work for you, otherwise, you all are on
your own :(
thanks,
