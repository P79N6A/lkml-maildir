I've read the patch and think you're right about this one.
Under normal loads 2.2.8 will have no problems at all except
possibly the fact that it calls reschedule_idle() twice on
most reschedules and the fact that the kernel still recalculates
the priority of _all_ processes as soon as one process runs
out of it's time slice.

More importantly, it can be done without an increase in
the scheduling overhead and with removal of the current
process recalculation ritual.
It will increase SMP scalability of the scheduler, allow
for a wider priority scale and maybe even decrease scheduler
overhead (I'm not sure about the last one being measurable
though)...
