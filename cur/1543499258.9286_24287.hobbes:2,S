I've noticed some odd behavior in kexportfs. Actions speaks louder
than words, so let me use the following example:
root@phoenix - /usr/src/knfsd-1.3.3b
>> kexportfs /export/localcdrom
root@phoenix - /usr/src/knfsd-1.3.3b
>> kexportfs | grep localcdrom
/export/localcdrom(ro,async,wdelay,secure,root_squash,no_all_squash,mapping=identity,anonuid=-2,anongid=-2)
root@phoenix - /usr/src/knfsd-1.3.3b
>> kexportfs -u /export/localcdrom
root@phoenix - /usr/src/knfsd-1.3.3b
>> kexportfs | grep localcdrom
/export/localcdrom(ro,async,wdelay,secure,root_squash,no_all_squash,mapping=identity,anonuid=-2,anongid=-2)
root@phoenix - /usr/src/knfsd-1.3.3b
>> kexportfs -r 
root@phoenix - /usr/src/knfsd-1.3.3b
>> kexportfs | grep localcdrom 
That illustrated, let me explain the behavior. kexportfs isn't
updating a table somewhere. The unexported entries are REALLY and
truly unexported (although hosts that still have it mounted still have
access, I don't recall if that's proper behavior or not), but
kexportfs reports them as being exported still. a kexportfs -r cleans
all this up, but if you've hand modified some export entries (say with
a script to export cdrom drives....) these mods go away. The proper
behavior would be to have kexportfs report the actual current export list.
Note that this is occurring on linux 2.2.9ac4, and knfsd 1.3.3b. I've
experienced this on a number of different kernel and knfsd version (I
think at least as far back as knfsd-981204 and linux-2.1.125) but
assumed I was just being stupid. For all I know I still am. 
If this is already fixed, ignore this report. Thanks.
