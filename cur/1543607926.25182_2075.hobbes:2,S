Gods, I hope they have reconsidered that in their 64-bit chips. The 32-bit
hash chains may be ugly, but the architected 32/64-bit MMU stuff is just
so incredibly baroque that it makes any other MMU look positively
beautiful ("Segments? Segments shmegments. Big deal").
I still have the occasional nightmares about the IBM block diagrams
"explaining" the PowerPC MMU in their technical documentation.
There's probably a perfectly valid explanation for them, though (*).

(*) Probably along the lines of the designers being so high on LSD that
they thought it was a really cool idea. That would certainly explain it in
a very logical fashion.
