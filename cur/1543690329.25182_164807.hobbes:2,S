Faintly indeed, it would even boot X on my little test machines :<
Oopsed when I tried to run tcpdump, etc.
Since test5-mm1 came out and doesn't have any of those problems, I will
assume that it escaped rather than was released.
I'll comment on some responsiveness testing on test5-mm1 and earlier
test4 stuff after I build test5-nick15 to include in the testing.
