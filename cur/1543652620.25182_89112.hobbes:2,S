Basic SII SATA support is merged. There are more infrastructure related
matters to resolve next - SATA hot swap means drivers can change
underneath users and neither the users nor the locking in the IDE code
expects it. "Suprise its a tape now!" during a CD burn for example
Beyond that there is the matter of SATA addressing, SATA2 and all the
mmio handling which right now is -really-ugly- because the core code
doesn't know what its doing.
You can use SATA in 2.5.47, just don't do anything clever with it
