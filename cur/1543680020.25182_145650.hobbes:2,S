Ok, then I guess the module will simply have to declare MODULE_ALIAS("aes")
and live in arch/s390/crypto/, which means that the common code
is not touched at all, but building both the z990 assembler as well
as the C implementation as modules requires editing /etc/modprobe.conf
to get the right one.
As soon as you have the new API for crypto cards, we can move to that
for autoprobing the CPU features and reliably using the right 
implementation.
Maybe you can add to your list something like the following items:
Requirements:
- Support for CPU specific optimized algorithms:
  - autodetection of CPU features (e.g. Pentium MMX or z990 crypto)
  - selection of different implementations. A high priority job
    probably wants to use the CPU while another job offloads crypto
    to an asynchronous add-on card.
