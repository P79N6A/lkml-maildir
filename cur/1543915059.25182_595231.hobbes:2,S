lower is better, but you have to take the thing below into account:

on my box the TSC overhead has hit CFS quite hard, i'm not sure that's 
true on Rob's box. So i'd expect them to be in roughly the same area.

yeah, it's much less pronounced in real life - a context-switch rate 
above 10,000/sec is already excessive - while for example the lat_ctx 
test generates close to a million context switches a second.

i dont think so - we want precise/accurate scheduling before 
performance. (otherwise tasks working off the timer tick could steal 
away cycles without being accounted for them fairly, and could starve 
out all other tasks.) Unless the difference was really huge in real life 
- but it isnt.
