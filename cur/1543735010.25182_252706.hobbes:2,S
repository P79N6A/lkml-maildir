I assume that's "&regs->status", since regs had better be a pointer..

Just make sure that you annotate "regs" as a pointer to IO space.
Ie if you have
	struct xxxx __iomem *regs;
then everything will be fine - sparse knows that "regs" is a IO pointer,
and that obviously makes "&regs->member" _also_ an IO pointer.
You'll need that __iomem annotation anyway, since otherwise sparse would
complain when you do the assignment from the "ioremap()" call (and the
thing had better come from ioremap() some way, or it's not valid in the
first place to do "readl()" on it).
