There are alternative ways* to get sata support for some chips but I
believe it's the right choice to do the 'full' route so I believe it's
the right choice. 2.4 will still be used for quite a while, especially
until "everybody" trusts 2.6, same way that happened with 2.2 and 2.4 ..
* siimage.c, add sata8237 entry to via driver, etc...
