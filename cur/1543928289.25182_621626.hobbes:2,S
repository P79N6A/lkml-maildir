I understand that this is how its supposed to work, but my analysis nevertheless
in my mind points to an inability to route irqs to any processor other than the
boot cpu.  I conducted a test whereby I forced a crash on cpu0, and then again
on cpu3.  I've found that on all the systems I have available, I'm able to boot
to a kexec kernel without issue.  However, on this system:
http://www.supermicro.com/Aplus/motherboard/Opteron8000/MCP55/H8QM8-2.cfm
Crashing on any cpu other than the boot cpu leads to a hang in calibrate_delay
on reboot.  I certainly make room for the notion that this could be an ioapic
programming error, but I don't see that this system has a different ioapic that
my other test systems.  I've also simply tried booting the system that is
failing with noapic, to force the system to not use the ioapic, to no avail.  If
you could suggest another test to point to another root cause, I would happily
run it, but the evidence that I have at the moment suggests to me that the
ioapic, while normally getting succefully programmed to deliver interrupts to
the appropriate cpu, is unable to on this system, and removing the traversal of
the system bus on the affected system restores functionality.  That suggests a
system bus error to me.

I think thats part of the issue.  Somehow (and in fairness I don't know how this
occurs), the crash of the kernel affects the functionality of the hypertransport
bus in such a way that it can no longer deliver interrupts.  I'm not sur how,
beyond the testing that I describe above, that I can further prove or disprove
this.

If you could suggest a test or observation to make so that I could further
diagnose this, I would appreciate it.  Currently the code seems to configure the
ioapic properly on all systems available to me, except the supermicro board
above.  Any thoughts welcome here.
