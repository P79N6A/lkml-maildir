    I didn't know that got merged.  Great!
    Debian users running 2.6: go install busybox-static, then make a
link from /sbin/sh to /bin/busybox.  If something bad happens to your
file system or libc or something like that, you can still boot with
init=/sbin/sh and get a shell prompt and all the important utilities
as long as /bin/busybox is okay.  It's a nice failsafe, especially
when testing kernels or running an unstable distribution.
   If this patch gets merged in 2.4, 2.4 users will be able to do this
too.
