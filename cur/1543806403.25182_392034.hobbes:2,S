This remains unaddressed:
+#ifdef CONFIG_NUMA
+			base = kmalloc_node(sizeof(*base), GFP_KERNEL, cpu_to_node(cpu));
+			if (!base)
+				/* Just in case, fall back to normal allocation. */
+#endif
+				base = kmalloc(sizeof(*base), GFP_KERNEL);
+			if (!base)
+				return -ENOMEM;
If we cannot allocate memory on this node for this CPU (wildly unlikely,
btw) we face a choice.  Either
a) Allocate memory from some other node, making the machine mysteriously
   run slower for the remainder of its uptime or
b) Fail the CPU bringup.
I think b) is better - it tells the operator that something went wrong, so
some sort of corrective action can be taken.  I suspect that most operators
would prefer that to having the kernel secretly make their machine run
slower.
