Sorry for the long delay on this.  I like the patch in general, there
are a few things I'd like to fix in it, though:
* Instead of naming the IOCTLs xxx_CMD2, could you name
  them xxx_CMD_CHANNEL, or something that conveys a
  little more meaning?
* The command unregister function needs to use a different
  matching function now that you have to allow non-exact
  matches for the channels.  You still need an exact match
  for unregistering.
* Someone mentioned using a bitmask for the channels
  you are registering.  I think that's a good idea.  IPMI
  only allows 16 channels max, so an unsigned int should
  be plenty.  Add a define for all channels and for setting
  a specific channel.
Thanks,
-Corey
