I thought that if that worked as intended, you wouldn't even
get the chance to choose SLUB=y?  That was how it was working
for me (but I realize I didn't try more than make oldconfig).

That sounds like what happens when SLUB's pagestruct use meets
SPLIT_PTLOCK's pagestruct use.  Does your .config really show
CONFIG_SLUB=y together with CONFIG_ARCH_USES_SLAB_PAGE_STRUCT=y?
