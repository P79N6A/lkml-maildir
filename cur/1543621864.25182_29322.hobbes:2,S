I didn't suggest that this was a PnP BIOS coding bug, but
a bug in the _called_ PnP BIOS (i.e., maybe it needs
to be blacklisted / "pnp_bios_is_utter_crap = 1" from
DMI tables).
I agree that this particluar SCSI driver has some
problems, but they didn't show up in the bug report that I
posted.  However, this was in the bug report:
| PnPBIOS: Found PnP BIOS installation structure at 0xc00f6010.
| PnPBIOS: PnP BIOS version 1.0, entry 0xf0000:0xb4a6, dseg 0x400.
| Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 0000de3a
|  printing eip:
|  00004298
Does that dseg value of 0x400 and eip value of 0x4298 give us
any clues/hints?
More info:
Booting with "pnpbios=no-res" or with "pnpbios=no-curr"
causes the same system hang (Oops) as in the original
email report.  [Note *differences* in "no-res" and "no-curr"
vs. "nores" and "nocurr".  Reading the source helps.  :]
