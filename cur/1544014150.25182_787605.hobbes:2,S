Sounds smart to me. He was able to get someone else to do the work. ;-)

Yep, I agree here too.

Yeah, this should be commented. Why this is not a race is because
the owner has the mutex here, and we have the lock->wait_lock. When
the owner releases the mutex it must go into the slow unlock path and
grab the lock->wait_lock spinlock. Thus it will block and not go away.
Of course if there's a bug elsewhere in the kernel that lets the task exit 
without releasing the mutex, this will fail. But in that case, there's 
bigger problems that need to be fixed.

Here, we get the owner before releasing the wait_lock.

Thanks for the complement on the design. It came about lots of work by 
many people in the -rt tree. What we need here is to comment the code for 
those that did not see the evolution of the changes that were made.
