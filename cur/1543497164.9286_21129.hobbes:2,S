Perhaps vgacon is what is normally used. mdacon is quite a strange
hack. Please let me know when you have something usable for hercules:
i'd really like to have scrollback for my secondary computer.

I'm not running XF86_MONO... Maybe I'll start it (my secondary
computer got amd486 upgrade, so it is no longer 386/40).
