Hi Greg,
Can you hold on adding this driver to driver/staging for a few weeks?
The driver I just submitted does compile and load but some important
features are not completed. We are still actively working on moving some
code to firmware to make it simpler and easier for code review. We
expect to get this done in next 2 or 3 weeks, at that time, we will
submit a complete driver which include the above mentioned change, and
all the code review comments we received in this submission.
Thanks!
Jing
