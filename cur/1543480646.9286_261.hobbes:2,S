Hi,
	I wanted to know if it is possible to pass (write) character strings to 
	the kernel at run time just as we can do so with integers.
	(For example, to enable (disable) ip_forwarding  we can write 1 (0) to   
	the ip_forward file in the proc directory. Simialrly, can I 
	write some strings into a file)
	Does the kernel already support this.
					thanks in advance
					gopi
