Um, I'd have to say that putting one value in a file with a directory as a grouping would probably be a nightmare to maintain as well as navigate through.  In essance you could end up with more files in the /proc than on the rest of the filesystem filesystem (excluding the /dev dir). It would start to have the whole proc tree look like something from /proc/sys/net/ipv4.  Although the  /proc/sys/net/ipv4 probably needs to have one value in a file as some of these are settable on from the console, other fiels that are not changable (like /proc/meminfo, proc/cpuinfo etc) would be a waste in one value per file.  
Isn't the /proc supposed to be a 'friendly' interface into the kernel?
Anyway it was a more of a question.

The general consensus is that if we have a major reorganization, in proc
the rule will be one value per file.  And let directories do the grouping.
