Subject: Why isn't 2.2.2-prex on the mirrors?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Perhaps I am being very stupid and, if this is so, please accept my
apologies.  The thing is, despite references on this list to pre-release
versions of 2.2.2, I can't seem to find it.
I have looked at
ftp://sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk/Mirrors/ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2
ftp://ftp.uk.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.2
and have not seen anything later than 2.2.1.  I have tried to access the
main site (ftp.kernel.org) but it always has too many users and I cannot
access it.  I understand that it is not necessary for me to use this
version as the changes from v2.2.1 -> v2.2.2-prex are insignificant in all
but a few cases, but I'd like to try it anyway.
Thanks,		David C.S. Prior
