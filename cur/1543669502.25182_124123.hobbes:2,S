    Can't you at least add a comment about what was there ? It's quite
    annoying to come across :
    #define FOO 1
    #define BAR 2
    #define BAZ 5
    and have no idea why
It happens all the time. Hundreds of cases.
I prefer a short and clean actual kernel source, and long
historical explanations somewhere else, for example in
Documentation/ioctl_list.
(Michael Elizabeth Chastain made ioctl_list.2 a man page,
but nobody keeps it up-to-date. The current version is from
1.3.27. I am updating it and expect to submit it for the
Documentation directory. Maybe more people will update it there.)
