Hmm...  I'd disagree... The operations of truncation and access should
be synchronized with respect to the mm, even if multiple threads are
performing the operations.  The application *should* have synchronization
to understand which event will happen first, but the principle of least
surprise would suggest that either the access would happen first
followed by truncation (and future access might then extend the file,
putting in zero'd pages for the range that was trunacated) or the
truncation will happen first, and the access (beyond the new end
of the file) will behave as a normal access beyond the end of file.
Having truly garbage data between the previous end of file and the
new end of file is just wrong.
