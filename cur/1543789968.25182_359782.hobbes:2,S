I agree with you. Alas my wording was misunderstandable und obviously 
carried a wrong tone.
I did not say "replace the core" in step 1. Also, the breakage which I 
refer to in step 1 would have to be immediately corrected in step 2 
(although not for the whole subsystem at once, to allow for a fast cycle 
of validation of what happened in step 1). Furthermore I specifically 
said that most steps may (let me add: and should) overlap.
