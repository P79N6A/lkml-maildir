It's a good example.  I had a bear of a time with the netfilter kernel 
config on my firewall (w/ IPv6 goodness) box, when the generic netfilter 
stuff landed.  For the first time in a long time, that firewall booted 
into a configuration that wouldn't forward+masq packets properly.

I think maybe ATA is just lucky.  I allowed myself to get bullied into 
avoiding 'select', even though I feel the same way as you.
ATA should select scsi-disk but doesn't, for example.
And at some point it becomes a matter of taste:  should ATA select 
BLOCK, or depend on BLOCK?  There are IMO good arguments either way.
