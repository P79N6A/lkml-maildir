I still see a need for a get_free_coherent_page() for use in cases
where you want to share physical memory with devices. On coherent
architectures get_free_page() does just fine today, but on machines
like the m68k it does not. Having a standard interface would making
device drivers portable a lot easier.
Question is which API would be the most appropriate.
