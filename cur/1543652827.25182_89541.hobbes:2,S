Well for that particular tree, the diff from mainline is quite
small, and those diffs are avowedly experimental.  That's why
it exists - the get fresh code some testing and exposure.
So people will need to use their judgement as to whether the
problem is in 2.5.47, or in the -bk snapshot which was taken from
Linus, or in the -mm addons.
If in doubt, people should go for the mailing list first.   Because
a) the response time will be better
b) more people will see it
c) the owners of the add-on patches can screen it quickly.
But hey.  It's early days yet, and it is easy to overdesign this 
sort of thing.  I'd say just start using the thing, and adapt
the work processes later on, based on some experience.
