I think this was to work around the fact that some buggy drivers try to 
grab spinlocks without disabling interrupts when they should, which 
would cause deadlocks when trying to rendez-vous every cpu via IPIs.
It's a bad idea to spin with interrupts disabled when they could very 
well be enabled, anyway.
