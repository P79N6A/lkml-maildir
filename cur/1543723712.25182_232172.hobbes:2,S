I'm not sure what to say about this, really.
Of course, yes, the patch is sufficiently safe and simple for it to be
mergeable in 2.6, if this is the way we want to do secure computing.  I'd
wonder whether the API should be syscall-based rather than /proc-based, and
whether there should be a config option for it.
But the wider questions are stuff like "where is all this coming from",
"where will it all end up" and "what are the alternatives".
