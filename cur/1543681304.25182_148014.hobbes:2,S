Hello,
I am still having trouble with getting the HPT374 driver work on an EPoX 
8K9A3+ board with an integrated HPT374 controller. 2.6.0 ends with a 
kernel panic in hpt372_tune_chipset when the driver is compiled in the 
kernel, with hpt366 as a module the same error occurs, this time only 
with a segfault. 2.4.21 behaves the similar way - with a monolitic 
kernel it does a kernel panic, the module loads but doesn't find any 
disk. The driver from Highpoint website works fine.
