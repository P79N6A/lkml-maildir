Subject: tty_[un]register_devfs putting 3K structures on the stack

tty_register_devfs and tty_unregister_devfs both declare "struct tty_struct" locals.
According to gdb:
(gdb) p sizeof(struct tty_struct)
$20 = 3084
This eats up most of a 4K page, and on UML this is causing the stack to flow off the page for some people.
Is it possible to make that tty_struct static or kmalloc it or something?
