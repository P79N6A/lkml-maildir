Pretty much the entire kernel and anything that has a loop in it.
That's why the use of preemption points can't work in that it
can't be spread throughout the kernel in the way you've mentioned.

The lock work is an all or nothing chunk. It's the main portion
of this patch that gives the major performance boost. All other
work is marginal at best to support latency or instrumentation
to back it. No insult, but Ingo's has said this multipule times.
