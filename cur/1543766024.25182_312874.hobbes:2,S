"Such a work" refers to "A program that contains no derivative of any
portion of the library."  A program that is statically linked against
the library clearly contains part or all of the library, and cannot
qualify for the lower threshold of section 5.  Section 5 is talking
about late binding to the library; dynamic linking is one example.
For programs distributed as object code that does contain part of the
library, the distributor must -- sooner or later -- comply with 6(a)
(allow the user to relink) or 6(b) (use dynamic linking).
