Could we please remove the fake revert from the git tree immediately?
http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=fc818301a8a39fedd7f0a71f878f29130c72193d
2.6.17 code has also the dropping of the lock. This was no reversion. 
Maybe there is a problem but then I'd like to hear about it:
               /* fixup slab chains */
                if (slabp->inuse == 0) {
                        if (l3->free_objects > l3->free_limit) {
                                l3->free_objects -= cachep->num;
                                /*
                                 * It is safe to drop the lock. The slab is
                                 * no longer linked to the cache. cachep
                                 * cannot disappear - we are using it and
                                 * all destruction of caches must be
                                 * serialized properly by the user.
                                 */
                                spin_unlock(&l3->list_lock);
                                slab_destroy(cachep, slabp);
                                spin_lock(&l3->list_lock);
                        } else {
                                list_add(&slabp->list, &l3->slabs_free);
                        }
