It is simple, the raid cards force LBA in the BIOS but Linux choose to
NUKE it and thus the offsets for finding the reserved sectors is all
wrong.  Again we (you) have forced drives to run in CHS by default and it
is wrong.  We can debate but if the drive supports LBA we must force LBA
in the kernel.
Now I am out of this argument.
