	The masses don't see the linux kernel code I expect.  I'd be
somewhat suprised if the majority of linux users actually went through
and read the kernel source.  It doesn't actually appear all THAT many
times (I havn't done an actual count, but it didn't look like that
many), and it (I'm sorry if it offends your sensibilities) is a form of
expression.
	Also, it seems unlikely to me that many very young folks will be
getting into the kernel and looking around.  It's rather unlikely your 13
year old is going to pick up swearing by grepping linux kernel source...
	It also to some extent has to do w/ the freedom the developers
have, linux often tries to do what is 'technically' correct, but other
than that give the developers the freedom they desire.  Perhaps it isn't
politically correct, but then, if that's what the developers were worried
about we most likely would not have a technically correct kernel.
