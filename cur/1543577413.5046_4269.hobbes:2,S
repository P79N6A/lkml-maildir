Change to that rule or from?  I *think* you just said:
  - If ->writepage successfully starts writeout on the page it clears
the dirty bit and returns 0
  - If not successful, ->writepage unlocks the page and return 1
Who is going to be responsible for checking that the page dirty bit was
really set, and what will happen if it wasn't?
