It is detected with the latest 2.6.17 kernel automatically [during
udev] and works fine.

This won't be fixed as part of 2.6.18.x?  Looking at the source for
the latest gentoo-sources in the 2.6.17 stream I don't see ID 4364 in
the source for sky2.c [sky2_id_table[]].  So why is it detected and
working there but not in 2.6.18?
I'll try adding the device to the table and see what happens.
Hint:  ICH8 was "fixed" between 2.6.17 and 2.6.18 and all of a sudden
my gige stops working which is attached off the ICH8.
