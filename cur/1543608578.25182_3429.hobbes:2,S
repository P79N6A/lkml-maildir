If a process is feeding writes into the request layer and then
stops to do a read, we've blown it.  There's nothing for the
elevator to elevate.

The default number of requests is 128.    This is in fact quite ample AS
LONG AS the filesystem is feeding decent amounts of reasonably localised
stuff into the request layer, and isn't stopping for reads all the time.
ext2 and the VFS are not.  But I suspect that with the ialloc.c change,
disk readahead is covering up for it.
The meaning of the parameter to elvtune is a complete mystery, and the
code is uncommented crud (tautology).  So I just used -r20000 -w20000.
This was based on observing the request queue dynamics.  We frequently
fail to merge requests which really should be merged regardless of
latency.  Bumping the elvtune settings fixed it all.  But once the
fs starts writing data out contiguously it's all academic.

Well.  I got to choose the benchmark.

Sure.  ext2 goes to great lengths to avoid intra-file fragmentation,
and then goes and adds its own inter-file fragmentation.
It's worse on larger partitons, because they have more of the 128 meg
block groups.

If it goes in ext2, yes.  Depends on what the ext2 gods say - there
may be some deep design issue I'm missing here.
