Hello,
I would like to report an oops I keep getting when I try to poweroff my
machine.
I am using a Cyrix 6x86 P166+ on a Soyo SY-5EHM V1.0 motherboard.
The problem occurs when I halt -p the machine, with APM enabled in kernel.
The oops occurs after the system has finished shutting down, exactly after
"Power off"
It must be motherboard specific, because it occured with an AMD K6-2 on the
same motherboard too, but not with the same GNU/Linux system on a Pentium II
and a different motherboard.
The APM section of kernel config is shown below:
CONFIG_APM=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_USER_SUSPEND is not set
CONFIG_APM_DO_ENABLE=y
CONFIG_APM_CPU_IDLE=y
CONFIG_APM_DISPLAY_BLANK=y
CONFIG_APM_POWER_OFF=y
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_MULTIPLE_SUSPEND is not set
# CONFIG_APM_IGNORE_SUSPEND_BOUNCE is not set
# CONFIG_APM_RTC_IS_GMT is not set
# CONFIG_APM_ALLOW_INTS is not set
I attach the output of the ksymoops program.
If you need any more missing information I will be happy to provide it.
