Can you clarify a bit?
Do you mean that the full revert of 2c81ce4 that already got committed is 
sufficient for you, or do you need to totally undo everything we've done 
to ec.c since -rc5, and thus also to revert the _other_ revert we did (in 
4af8e10a6c57e7292862bd1703712f0565c7e429)?
In other words, what does "rest of drivers/acpi/ec.c patch" mean? Does it 
mean just the IRQ storm patch, or does it mean everything that happened in 
drivers/acpi/ec.c since 2.6.25-rc5?
