Kernels almost never follow ABI used by applications to last detail.
Linux kernel is disabling red zone and use kernel code model, yet the
ABI is not going to be adjusted for that.
This is resonably easy to fix on kernel side in signal handling, or by
removing std usage completely (I believe it is not performance win, but
some benchmarking would be needed to double check)
