Is that a joke?  Are you really proposing to do _that_ on anything resembling
a hot path?
BTW, the problems here really have nothing to do with namespaces or
lazy umount, seeing that it's whitelisting.  Moderate amount of bindings
will kill you here.  So much that I suspect that one-time overhead of
creating a namespace and umounting / remounting noexec / etc. on
execve() will be cheaper than all this crap.
