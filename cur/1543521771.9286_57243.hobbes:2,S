I am in the process of making Linux STREAMS compatible with the 2.3.x
kernel.  One of the functions that has to be implemented in STREAMS is
the "clone driver".  The idea is that a driver can pick its own minor
device number from a pool so that a driver that manages a bunch of minor
devices need only have one entry in /dev.  When a user opens this /dev
file he/she gets a unique instance of whatever the driver is managing
(e.g., pseudo-ttys, virtual circuit, etc).
This would be _much_ easier to implement if the driver could call
do_mknod() to create a new pseudo-node for the device and do_unlink() to
later deallocate it.  These two are presently not in the ksyms list.
Would someone be so kind as to add these to ksyms?
Thanks,
Dave
