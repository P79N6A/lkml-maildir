Christoph,
We tested SLUB on a 2 socket Clovertown (Core 2 cpu with 2 cores/socket)
and a 2 socket Woodcrest (Core2 cpu with 4 cores/socket).  
We found that for Netperf's TCP streaming tests in a loop back mode, the
TCP streaming performance is about 7% worse when SLUB is enabled on
2.6.21-rc7-mm1 kernel (x86_64).  This test have a lot of sk_buff
allocation/deallocation.
For Volanomark, the performance is 7% worse for Woodcrest and 12% worse
for Clovertown.
Regards,
Tim
