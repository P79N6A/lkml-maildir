	There is a problem with the AVerMedia TVPhone98 and the bttv 
driver included in the kernel (pre7ac4), using the Hawppage New (or 
autodetect) it works except that the AUDIO_MUTE is inverted, well, not 
exactly inverted, if you change all the calls to audio(bttv, AUDIO_MUTE) 
for audio(bttv, AUDIO_UNMUTE) it works.
	Well, I've already note this problem since bttv 0.5.19 to 0.6.1, 
and in all previous versions of the kernel's driver, but I suppose it 
would finally be fixed before 2.2.0, but the bttv driver has been updated 
and it keeps failing on it.
	For more info email me please.
