   Oh, you're cycle timer is too slow to be interesting, apparently ;(
We could modify the test program to use more portably timing functions
and doing the TLB accesses several times over.  While this would get
us something more reasonable on PPC, and be more portable, the results
would be a bit less accurate because we'd be dealing effectively with
averages instead of real cycle count samples.
