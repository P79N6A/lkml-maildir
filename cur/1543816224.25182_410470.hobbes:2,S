It is definitely this patch.  Identical steps (also used an untainted
kernel for both tests) on -mm1 with and without that patch, and when the
patch is reversed, I cannot cause the oops.  I booted into single user
mode (to dodge tainting and any other weirdness), started the dbus
system message daemon and hald (which depends on dbus), then performed
the steps mentioned above.
Thanks!
