Hi everyone.
Suspend2, version 2.2.2 is now available from
http://stage.suspend2.net/downloads/all/suspend2-2.2.2-for-2.6.16.tar.bz2
This is the first stable release since switching to sharing the lowlevel code 
with swsusp. It means that I'm now more dependent on Rafael and Pavel not 
changing things in an incompatible way, but it is a gain in that it reduces 
the amount of code that needs to be maintained by approximately 1000 lines.
Since I announced my new job a few weeks ago, the impetus to seek to merge 
Suspend2 has been renewed. I'm currently building a git tree to this end. 
It's not yet publicly available because I'm using stgit and am sometimes 
modifying earlier patches in the series and rebasing it against later 
versions of Linus' tree, but once it's done, I'll let people know where to 
find it.
Regards,
Nigel
