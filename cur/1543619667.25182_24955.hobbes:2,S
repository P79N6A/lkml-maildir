I wonder how your commercial customers develop code then. Either each
programmer futzes around in his/her own tree, and then creates a patch (or
some such) for everybody to see (then I don't see the point of source
control as a help to the individual developer), or everybody sees all the
backtracking going on everywhere (in which case the repository is a mostly
useless mess AFAICS).
