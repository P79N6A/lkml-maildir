The following fix was omitted from 2.4.3.  It corrects a problem
where the mtrr code attempts to set up a region twice as large as
the user requested.
The original message appeared in linux-kernel on 14 Mar 2001.

Oops, it got broken by the MTRR >32-bit support in 2.4.0-testX.  The
patch below should fix it.
Joerg, I think this might well fix your Cyrix mtrr problem also.
Let me know how it goes,
Dave Wragg
