The thing is that the indivual 'users' will be downloading
files at modem and adsl speeds, meaning a LOT of apache
daemons could be sitting around on the server.
You are right though that this is more of an overall system
benchmark than a pure VM test.  On the other hand, the VM
doesn't function on its own, it really needs to be part of
a larger system ;)

That might be a useful test.  How useful it would be we can't
really know until we've tried, but it definately does sound like
it's worth a try...

I can't say in advance how useful it would be, but my gut
feeling is that it might help getting things right.
