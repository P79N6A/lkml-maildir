I'm sure you've run across this one:
	
http://netfilter.samba.org/security-fix/
I'd like to know how official this patch is, ie how
well checked out? I'd hardly want to cure one problem
and create another. And I'm uncomfortable with it at
first glance: I'd have to find figure out why it is
returning immediate success at that point, or rather
prove to myself that it is just skipping making the
bad table entries.
