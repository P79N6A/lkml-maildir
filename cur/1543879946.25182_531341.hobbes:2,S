Eww.  The IORESOURCE IRQ bits are intentionally chosen to be the same as
the IRQF bits:
include/linux/interrupt.h:
/*
 * These correspond to the IORESOURCE_IRQ_* defines in
 * linux/ioport.h to select the interrupt line behaviour.  When
 * requesting an interrupt without specifying a IRQF_TRIGGER, the
 * setting should be assumed to be "as already configured", which
 * may be as per machine or firmware initialisation.
 */
The exception is IRQF_SHARED which should be a _driver_ choice not a
_platform_ choice, and therefore makes no sense in your "get_irq_flags"
definition.
Plus, if we ever did want to introduce such a function, it should be
a generic thing, not specific to some random power subsystem de jour.
