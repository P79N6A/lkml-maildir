I've already listed two rather large technical reasons.
When a vendor submits code, they know their [hardware | filesystem] 
best, but Linux kernel developers know the kernel code and kernel 
direction best.
There needs to be a meeting of the minds.  Vendors that stick to "I know 
best" line of reasoning don't get very far in Linux.
