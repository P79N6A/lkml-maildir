No, the point is that the resend is suppressed for all interrupts which
are marked with IRQ_LEVEL:
        /*
         * We do not resend level type interrupts. Level type
         * interrupts are resent by hardware when they are still
         * active.
         */
        if ((status & (IRQ_LEVEL | IRQ_PENDING | IRQ_REPLAY)) == IRQ_PENDING) {
	....
This is not witchcraft, this is how the hardware works.

But it is not different from the original implementation before we
introduced the delayed disable, simply because before the delayed
disable change only edge type interrupts were ever resent.

There is no 100% guarantee for any of the proposed changes.

Safer in what way ? 
The alternative patches (including my first debug patch, which got
merged during my vacation) are just pampering over the real problem
instead of fixing it.

If there is code which gets affected by the removal of the useless
resend of level type interrupts, then this code needs to be fixed and
not a wrong behavior preserved for no good reason.
