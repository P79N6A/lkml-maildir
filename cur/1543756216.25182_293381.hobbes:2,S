I'm not the maintainer, but it looks fine to me except for use
of numeric constants (e.g 0x5f, 0x18) instead of adding #defines
to name the values. But if no one knows what those offsets are for
we'll just have to leave it.

Unfortunately, I didn't anything documenting 0x5f and 0x18.
Will m7101.c be modified once quirks enabling the device?
