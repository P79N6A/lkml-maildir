Heh, on my system, I get no cursor, and no letters, either (this is
vga text console). I *can* see the backgrounds, for example if I run
aumix I see colored blocks... Framebuffer does not seem to work,
either.
Letters are present for a while during boot; not sure what makes them
go away.

I'd test on N620c, but it is rather hard without video :-(.
