We just put 2.2.0 pre6 on our 2 processor SMP box with 512MB ram,
Adaptec SCSI + 2 IDE drive system, w/ a Tulip 10/00 ethernet adapter:
NFS messages:
Jan 12 09:42:49 bass kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 158.155.4.13
Jan 12 09:43:35 bass kernel: lockd: failed to monitor 158.155.4.13
This doesn't seem to hurt much, but lockd is running on the other node 
(an old NCR ATT Unix machine) and we've used NFS locking with it
before.
More bothersome are the follwoing messages which are filling up the
log for certain processes only:

Notice that some characters are being dropped in the messages:

...Ad Nauseum
What do these messages mean?  Did I unintentionally turn something on
I shouldn't have?
