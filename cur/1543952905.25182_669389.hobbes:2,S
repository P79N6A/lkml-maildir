Mmm, well indeed that may be the kernel framebuffer.
Justin, one thing you could try is to set your system to boot up without
starting gdm.  Either do this via /etc/X11/default-display-manager
(comment it out, or set to xdm or something) or bypass it entirely by 
mv /etc/rc3.d/{S30,K30}gdm, and then append '3' to the end of the boot line
in grub.  (Maybe there's a better way to achieve this with upstart, but
my upstart-fu is limited.)
