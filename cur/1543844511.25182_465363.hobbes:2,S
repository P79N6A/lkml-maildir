Hello Christoph,
	Thank you for the review of the patches.	
	With implementation of tasklet in the driver we see a
performance increase of about 8%, so we decided to go with it.
Regards,
Sumant

Why would you need this?  The normal scsi command completion is
offloaded
to the SCSI softirq ASAP so I don't see any point for those.  Do you see
too much time spent in completion of the internal commands?
