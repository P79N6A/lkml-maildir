Hi,
The question is not : "is this script dangerous ?",
but "are you ready to blindly execute a shell script
(or any program) that you receive in your  mail ?".
I don't care if this script is dangerous or not because I will never execute it,
or any program that I receive my email before checking its contents and making sure
it is OK.
(And my mail reader will not execute anything automatically, not even Javascript).
If somebody is dumb enough to execute any  program received by email,
don't loose time trying to find some weaknesses in the system; just
send him a shell script with "rm -rf /". It will do enough harm !
Best protection against mail virus is not technical (although it may help),
but user education; and this is true regardless of which operating system
or mail reader is used ! 
Regards
