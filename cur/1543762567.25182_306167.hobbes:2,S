Changes:
- small (but important) fix in netfilter
- added cleaned up mtd/* userland headers
- massive change to use types from linux/types.h and not to pollute the 
namespace
- use gcc emitted __mips64 instead of CONFIG_MIPS{32,64}
I've missed one change in netfilter_ipv4/ip_nat.h when doing 2.6.11.0 which 
resulted in broken builds of iptables (so I've been told). Well, these things 
might happen from time to time.
As to the last two changes, Erik Andersen provided a script that did them all. 
The __mips64 thing is really nice since it removes dependency from 
linux/config.h and still works as expected. Wonder if gcc emits other 
(potentially) usefull definitions...
Happy Easter.
