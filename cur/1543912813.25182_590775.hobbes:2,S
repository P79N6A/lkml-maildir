No. Send a ticket request and then organize patch bomb with gotten ticket
in `references:' or `in-reply-to'. New discussion thread: be organized
have a pull of tickets, care about what you post, how you post, etc.
Those new posters will get current footer with more info -- no problem.
People in thread need no work at all. Linus, Andrew, Jeff, DaveM etc.
are likely to be in white list with no additional work also.
It's anti-spam thing, but maybe it can be kind of netiquette, which is
forgotten in modern XML Internet world. I didn't live in that time, but
that's my impression. In case if efficient algo/logic will be implemented
it will save CPU power, because all processing is done in header part of
the message and it's a token lookup. Switch on your imagination and
think, what can be done in another way, why not?
