I am not saying put an FS into a file, I am saying make the filesystem
effective enough that nobody needs to create things like structured
storage.  Given that as a goal, what is needed?
I propose the following:
* inheritance of file bodies
* inheritance of stat data
* a syntax based on rdf for writing to files which have inheritance
  (solving this stumbling block was important for me)
* filters, such that "dirname/..tar" generates a tar file when read, and 
  "dirname/..cat" concatenates for read, and "filename/..filtername" runs 
   filtername on the file/directory filename.
* overloading directory names so that if they are opened as files they are 
  files, and if accessed as directories they are directories.
All of these features are valuable in and of themselves.  Together they
collectively eliminate all need for structured storage.  Jeremy
Allison's needs for emulating W2k are a good test of whether that goal
has been reached, and so I use his needs as one test.
