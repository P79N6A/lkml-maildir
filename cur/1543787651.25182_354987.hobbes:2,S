This is not how we do things in Linux.  You're doubling the maintenance 
burden.
If you really want to do this, at least don't fill up drivers/scsi/ with 
an additional, completely unrelated codepath.

There is commonality between aic94xx and MPT/LSI stuff.  aic94xx SAS 
transport layer is a superset of MPT/LSI SAS transport:  it clearly 
needs far more management code.
We understand this.  The part you don't understand is that we want to 
emphasize the commonality, rather than let aic94xx and MPT/LSI go in 
completely different directions.
Read it again:  aic94xx/BCMxxx is a superset of functionality, not 
completely different.
