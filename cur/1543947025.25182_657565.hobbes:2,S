OK, I will.

No, I don't think so, because unregister_dropped_devices() calls
device_unregister() that does the put_device() eventually.
If we are called by device_unregister(), the get_device() is needed to balance
the put_device() that will be called by device_unregister() after we return.
OTOH, if we are called directly, then we need to balance the put_device()
that will be done by device_unregister() called from
unregister_dropped_devices().
I hope I didn't miss anything.

No, it's not.  Didn't I remove it?  I thought I did.
