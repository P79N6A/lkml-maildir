I hope they do; I've just set up a very similar beast (looks like the same
mobo and same CPUs). Is the RAM "registered" ECC? Are your CPUs the same
stepping? One problem we were bitten by was the Radeon DRI, so we disabled
it (in XF86Config-4) and it now seems to at least boot into X. However,
it's not any faster than a dual PIII (1GHz) at the task it's meant to
perform :( both CPUs report 75% usage, and vmstat 1 doesn't show the IO
systems being slugged. Very strange. We're wondering if we've hit memory
bandwidth as the tasks involve some hard sums with big matrices.
