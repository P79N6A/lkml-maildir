First, Let me say that I think that the TTY layer doesn't help me as a
driver writer enough: There is too much "administration" that a driver
needs to do. For example, the whole "open" logic is now implemented
again and again in every serial driver. I think a driver should be
responsible for talking to the hardware, and the "driving layer"
should do the thinking.
I asked around, and was told that I should make a "library" like layer
that drivers could use to simplify stuff. A driver would then be able
to choose the "generic" (but maybe a bit slow) stuff, or implement
things by itself. For example a driver for a board that has a 4k
output buffer, may want to skip the 4k write buffer in the kernel. 
It's not quite finished completely the way I want it, but it's a lot
better than before. (SX and RIO now share around 2k lines-of-code
through "generic-serial". That's good.)  So far, generic-serial simply
has the stuff from serial.c that isn't talking to the hardware.
