Subject: kernel-doc:  what is the purpose of "&struct"?

  according to the kernel-doc HOWTO, the following should be
"highlighted" in some way if found in the extractable documentation of
your source file:
  '&struct_name' - name of a structure (up to two words including 'struct')
but examples of that, at least in the HTML, are simply printed in
regular font prefixed with '&' -- i don't see that any "highlighting"
is being done.
  the intermediate XML contains simply "&amp;struct", which certainly
doesn't suggest any special processing or highlighting.
  am i missing something?
