Hi Oleg,

No exactly. This means that the task can be preempted, and can therefore
sleep, but we do not allow this sleeping task to be migrated to a
different CPU.

If we look at try_to_wake_up, it seems to take the new_cpu from
task_cpu(), which comes from the thread info ->cpu, updated by
set_task_cpu(). The *_move_tasks seems to be responsible for calling
can_migrate_task() to see if, in a deferred way, the migration_thread
can use set_task_cpu() to change the task's cpu.
move_task_off_dead_cpu() does not seem to respect this though: it could
potentially move away a process while it is in a critical section by
forcing a __migrate_task. I guess I should put a test in __migrate_task
also so move_task_off_dead_cpu() can try to repeat the migration.

Right. Neighter does copy_process set the preemption count. It seems to
be dealt by sched_fork() when the thread is first scheduled in to make
sure that the preempt count is 1. I guess is would be safer to set the
migration count to 0 there too. (or set it to one if we ever decide to
make it the kernel default).

Yes, just noted this earlier. I first thought it was using
can_migrate_task(), but it does not seem so.
