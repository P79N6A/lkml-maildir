ehhh what do you need it for???
without knowing that it's hard to give recommendations
[Jon M. Hanson] I'm writing a kernel module that dumps out the contents
of physical memory and the state of the CPU(s) based on an event. I
don't want to traverse memory that isn't actually used as system RAM
(like the 1 M hole, devices, etc.).
