There is a problem with PCMCIA<->ATA adapters and "True IDE mode":
A CompactFlash unit enters "True IDE mode" when the /OE pin is held low
at device power on. This is fine when your system is powered on with
the CF card inserted. But if you insert a CF card into an already
powered on system, the /OE pin is not connected to the socket and thus
held high by an device-internal pull up at device power on. This is
because the power pins are longer than the other pins and connected
before the others! So the CF card enters "memory mapped mode" instead
of "True ATA mode" and is no longer accessible from the ATA host.
Ciao,
