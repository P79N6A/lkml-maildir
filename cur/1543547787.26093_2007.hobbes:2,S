Actually, I've considered a form of diff/patch which represented context
and deleted lines by their md5sum.  Thus, the diff only contains long hex
strings plus code that I wrote.  (My actual desire was to figure out a way
that I could release QuakeC modifications under the GPL, when the base
QuakeC source was not GPL.  I hope there's no ethical brown stuff involved
in that desire!)
Or is md5sum(line N of file) a derivative work of file?  If so, what duty
do I have under the GPL if I tell you md5sum(line N of GPL'd file)?
God, this stuff gets too weird when you start thinking about it.
