Just to second what Andy already stated: it's more likely the
Megaraid firmware could be better at fetching the SG lists.
This is a difficult problem since the firmware needs to work
well on so many different platforms/chipsets.
If LSI has time to turn more stones, get a PCI bus analyzer and filter
it to only capture CPU MMIO traffic and DMA traffic to/from some
"well known" SG lists (ie instrument the driver to print those to
the console). Then run AIM7 or similar multithreaded workload.
A perfect PCI trace will show the device pulling the SG list in
cacheline at time after the CPU MMIO reads/writes from the card
to indicate a new transaction is ready to go.
Another stone LSI could turn is to verify the megaraid controller is
NOT contending with the CPU for cachelines used to build SG lists.
This something the driver controls but I only know how to measure
this on ia64 machines (with pfmon or caliper or similar tool).
If you want examples, see
	
http://iou.parisc-linux.org/ols2004/pfmon_for_iodorks.pdf
In case it's not clear from above, optimal IO flow means the device
is moving control data and streaming data in cacheline or bigger units.
If Megaraid is already doing that, then the PCI trace timing info
should point at where the latencies are.
