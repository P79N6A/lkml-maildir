Rene - 
Thanks for the follow up - from my perspective now that I know that the
condition that caused the warning messages has been with us for some
time, and that previously the messages were suppressed it really does
not make that much difference to me if the warnings are reverted or not.
So I guess that I vote for doing whatever is best for the developer.
After all they are the ones doing the heavy lifting. If the warning
message is able to provide some insight into the problem so much the
better.
At this point my goal is just to learn enough to be an asset as a tester
instead of a net loss (defined as someone whose efforts cost the team
more man-hours than their contribution is worth)
