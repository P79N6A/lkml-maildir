Hi!
Theres usability problem with make oldconfig & pmdisk:
  Software Suspend (EXPERIMENTAL) (SOFTWARE_SUSPEND) [Y/n/?] y
  Suspend-to-Disk Support (PM_DISK) [Y/n/?] y
    Default resume partition (PM_DISK_PARTITION) [] (NEW)
Unfortunately at this point I do not know if it should be in /dev/hda1
or hda1 form (I guess its /dev/hda1), so I try to get some help. I
press ? <enter> and bang, partition is set to "?".
I'm not sure how to solve this. Maybe 
  Software Suspend (EXPERIMENTAL) (SOFTWARE_SUSPEND) [Y/n/?] y
  Suspend-to-Disk Support (PM_DISK) [Y/n/?] y
    Default resume partition in /dev/hdXX form (PM_DISK_PARTITION) [] (NEW)
is good idea? Anyway helptexts for text entries are useless in
oldconfig :-(.
