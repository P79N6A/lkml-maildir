Only if they have CAP_SYS_RAWIO.  I admit it takes a lot more
to get there than just that.  But having a mechanism that has the
potential to be secured and is much simpler to understand
and to setup for minimal privileges than any of the other unix
addons I have seen is very interesting.

For everything except the PID namespace I am just interested in having multiple
separate namespaces.  For the PID namespace to keep the traditional unix
model you need a parent process so it is actually nesting.
I am interested because, it is easy, because if it is possible than
the range of applications you can apply a containers to is much
larger.  At the far end of that spectrum is migrating a server running
on real hardware and bringing it up as a guest on a newer much more
powerful machine.  With the appearance that it had only been
unreachable for a few seconds.

Entering is different from execing a process on the inside.
Implementation wise it is changing the context pointer on your task.

For debugging this is a good reason for being inside.  What if the
problem is that you are out of resources?  
I have no intention of requiring monitoring to work from the inside though.

No I need to post patches.
