For parisc (and I suspect many other architectures), the situation
is clear.  Nobody has ever used minixfs, and the only possible reason
to use it is for data transfer from another system.  Now, there's more
i386/minix systems in existence than there are m68k/minix, so I'd actually
prefer to switch parisc to support the LE minix format.  Or, since that
would involve doing work for something that nobody would ever use, just
disabling it on parisc.  If anyone ever wants it, they can do the work.
