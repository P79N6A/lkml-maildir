I believe so.

There is a small shim layer required, but the bulk of the code
implementing GPFS is common between AIX and Linux.  It was on AIX
first by quite a few years.

If they are made available, yes.  That is the point of this patch,
after all.  ;-)

You -can- run GPFS in the 2.4 kernel without core-kernel patches,
as long as you don't mind putting up with mmap/page-fault races and
with NFS exports from different nodes handing out the same lock to two
different NFS clients.  ;-)

That is indeed the idea.

It is tested on specific kernel versions.  Clearly moving from 2.4 to
2.6 requires some change.

Hmmm...  You seem to have a rather expansive definition of
"a few lines of code".  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
