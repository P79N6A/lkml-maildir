wrong comparison
you have a book, book is gpl'd. You have another book with another plot.
THat other book doesn't need to be gpl'd.
you have a book, book is gpl'd. Your other book now requires the first
book to change it's plot so that the two books form a series. This is
where your lawyer will get nervous.
Think of it differently perhaps, and it's a question of "where is the
boundary of the work"
You can see the situation with the syscall change in 2 ways:
1) kernel + modification is a work
   userspace app is a separate work
or
2) kernel is a work
   userspace app and the kernel modification are together one work
in this 2nd case you have a GPL issue. The question is if your lawyer
can convince the judge that the second interpretation is unreasonable.
That may or may not be easy, depending on the exact nature of the
modification.
