This sounds like a receipe for creating unportable programs because
the alignment constraints will be different from one platform to
another.  (Adding gethugepagesize() in libc would alleviate the
problem but it wouldn't solve it completely.)
Overall, it does sound to me that the hugetlbfs is so specialized that
it would be much cleaner to provide a separate interface at the
user-level.  That would leave more flexibility should the
implementation change over time (which it well might).
