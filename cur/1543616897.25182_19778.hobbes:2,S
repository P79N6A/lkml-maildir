O.k.  Thanks, I missed that part.  I just looked back and it is clear
that there are 32 bit values encoded in hexadecimal.  And I admit the
bigendian (human readable) is strongly implied from the context.

O.k.  So the we have a bit of implied padding after the filename.  And
it is necessary to preserve this padding or we break with the
prexisting format definition.  You don't gain much with that as being
4 byte aligned on 64bit architectures, is not fully aligned.

Which we are reusing for a different purpose.  And because of that we
become trustees of our version of the format.  To make it clear that
someone else defines how this format works a reference to the
appropriate specification is called for.  
I admit I did a quick search earlier and I did not find this format
specified, elsewhere.
The cases where initramfs will be used are some of the most operating
specific cases I can imagine.  To handle those cases it is necessary
to support the full breadth of the capability of the operating system.
So if initramfs is going to survive todays implementation of the linux
kernel, or possibly be portable to other operating systems we must
have an extensible format.  It appears c_magic gives us that
extensibility.
