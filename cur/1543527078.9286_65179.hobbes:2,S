It would be a *very* bad idea for some applications to have a system
where we couldn't run without devfs, unless there is considerable
benefit to such an arrangement.  So far, there is no evidence of that,
so having a system that works with a traditional /dev should be a
requirement.  However, that's *NOT* an argument for putting things in
/proc.
