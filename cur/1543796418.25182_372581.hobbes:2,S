Your problem statement is correct, but you're fixing the symptoms, not
the cause.
What we need is an easier way for users to pull in kernel updates with
the matching kernel-related user-space.
This is provided, though with some lag, by Fedora, openSUSE, Debian
testing, dare I say gentoo and others.
The right way to address this is to work with the distribution of your
choice to make these updates available faster.
