that is the remaining VMA, not the new one; we trigger this code:
	/* Does it split the last one? */
	last = find_vma(mm, end);
	if (last && end > last->vm_start) {
		int error = split_vma(mm, last, end, 1);
		if (error)
			return error;
	}
So, since its the last VMA that needs to be split (there is only one),
the new VMA is constructed before the old one. Like so:
  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
  BBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Then you proceed closing, in this case the new one: B.
