Yes this is a known problem. In the case of SMP kernel
and low_latency, and 8250.c, this causes a dead lock. This has
resurfaced again and again for many months from
different sources.
There is disagreement on what code is
in error and what should be fixed. So it stays broken.

If low_latency is set and you are not calling
from interrupt, then calling work directly speeds processing.
I submitted a patch that forced schedule_delayed_work
if in interrupt context to avoid this problem. It was rejected.
