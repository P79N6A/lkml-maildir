Greetings,
I'm wondering if anyone has direct contact to an *active developer for the
MWAVE DSP loader for linux.  I unfortunately have an IBM thinkpad 755ce
and I want to be able to free up all this space win95/dos is wasting.  I
would like to test any such driver, or do documentation or some coding.  I
can't find specs anywhere for the vile little thing, and for some reason
the MWAVE hack doesn't work with the standard 8MB of ram.  I want to help
get MWAVE working natively, since I have no free pcmcia slots for a new
soundcard.  FYI, I've been to 
http://www.flexion.org/mwave
 and posted a
message.  I've had no replies as yet. =(
cheers,
Terry
