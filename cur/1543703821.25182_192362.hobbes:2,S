I did read the instructions for reporting kernel bugs and would certainly
have sent any such reports if the computer had produced them in the first
place.  There are none, but the bug appears to be completely reproducible.
If you don't have an EFS CD to test with, perhaps SGI won't mind if I
make you a copy of something completely out of date such as the IRIX
5.3 development option CD, which they are giving out for free anyway
these days.
