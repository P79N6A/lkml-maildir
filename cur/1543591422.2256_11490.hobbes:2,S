'gcc version 3.0 20010426' is fine.
I don't have 2.96 at the moment, but can install if necessary.
With the value of on_chip_cache unused, the block could be commented out.
If activated, the cpu->type should be masked (at least for our machines).
Anyone with better knowledge of the alpha's hwrpb than me, please check if
the value of cpu->type can be masked, e.g. to the lower 32 (8?) bits.
Greetings, Mike
