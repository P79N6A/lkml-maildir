Mike, 
    I read your posting on the Linux kernel mailing list about
having problems with 2.2.11. I had problems with 2.2.11 after
about 1.5 days of uptime, and told you to avoid 2.2.11 like the
plague. That was a while ago and suggested that you try 2.2.12
and you were worried about the mem leak in 2.2.12. Well the mem
leak in 2.2.12 is smaller than the one in 2.2.11. There is a
patch agains 2.2.11 so if you are bent on staying with 2.2.11
then get the patch. I have had 2.2.12 and my machine has been up
for 15 days so far(9:01pm  up 14 days 23:01), I had a problem
after 9 days and rebooted this time it is about 15. There is
also a patch for 2.2.12 and its slow page mem leak, but I am not
sure how to apply that as patch -p0 < <patch> did not seem to
work for me, but I am sure it was something I was doing wrong.
   As far as the vmware goes, when you install or upgrade vmware
you can have it build the modules for you automagically like I
do. For the most part this seem better, as usually it does not
have modules for the kernel / system. I have had a few problems
with the various builds of vmware including the one that you
have. Eveer since I started using vmware my cdrom has been going
south. I am not sure if it is vmware or if it is just a cheep
cdrom drive.  
FYI:   About vmware and the source.  They do deliver the source
to the modules,  it is located in the
vmware-distrib/lib/modules/source directory as a few tarball. So
if there is any problems related to vmware's modules it would be
possible to look at the source code. It includes the makefiles
and everything. 
   Something else to keep in mind about vmware is that they are
writing there own drivers for hardware, their bidirectional 
parallel port uses a /dev/parport* device, I guess this allows
them a direct hardware access method (my best guess).
