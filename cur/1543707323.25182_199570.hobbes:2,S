I considered it, but no cleanup called request_module which I
(reluctantly, as it made the locking non-trivial) dropped the lock
around init.

Well, that's pretty stupid, but I think this should be fixed in the
module code for a practical reason: the number of oopses or hangs in
rmmod functions.  Bad enough that the module is useless: stopping
other module operations is very suboptimal.

Patch seems OK to me.  I'd prefer it to go via the -mm tree though to
shake things out in case I've missed something.
Thanks,
Rusty.

Name: Drop Lock Around Module Exit
Status: Experimental
From: Andrea Arcangeli <andrea@suse.de>
Turns out parport can do request_module from its exit function.  We
should drop lock anyway, because too many module exit functions oops
or hang anyway, rendering all module ops useless.
