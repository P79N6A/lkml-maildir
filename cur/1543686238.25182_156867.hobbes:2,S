First of all, compiling my own kernel with gcc 3.3.1 resulted in less 
than 10% difference in the size of the kernel image (and ACPI is not 
part of my kernel) - the mere difference in size isn't that important 
except for special needs (like boot _floppies_ or embedded systems 
with very limited memory).
The benchmarking Christoph was referring to was to check whether a 
kernel completely compiled with -Os is faster than a kernel compiled 
with -O2. This might sound strange, but if the code is smaller more fits 
into the cache and modern CPUs suffer much every time they need to 
access the incredibly slow RAM.
