Isn't this what the severity levels are for?  Not just filtering messages out 
but telling you whether or not it's important?

Seconded.
The point of a diagnostic message is to convey information.  Deep in the 
bowels of chipsets there are diagnostic messages that get spit out as 
hexcodes that some program needs to interpret, but that's why we have tools 
like 
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davej/tools/parsemce.c
 and 
such.
If the diagnostic messages need a talmud, I see this is as more of a problem 
with said diagnostic messages, rather than excuse to add another layer.

If you're going to tweak printk, please make the darn thing take an integer 
first argument rather than a string first argument, so we can use clever 
macros to remove them at compile time rather than having them compiled in but 
not displaying.
This is one of those things buried down on my todo list.  I think it can be 
converted incrementally
Going back to the original patch here, there are exactly two examples of what 
this brave new infrastructure would be used for:

This is just a thought: why not have the actual kprintf say "Device number %x 
is %s" where %s is "online", "offline", or "broken"?
I.E. have the kernel output a user readable message in the first place.

kprintf(LEVEL "device %x not online, try 'chccwdev -e %x'", devnum, devnum)
