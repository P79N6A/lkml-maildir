What happens when we need to run reclaim against just a section of a zone?
Lumpy-reclaim could be used here; perhaps that's Mel's approach too?
We'd need new infrastructure to perform the
section-of-a-zone<->physical-memory-block mapping, and to track various
states of the section-of-a-zone.  This will be complex, and buggy.  It will
probably require the introduction of some sort of "sub-zone" structure.  At
which stage people would be justified in asking "why didn't you just use
zones - that's what they're for?"

That's rather pointless.  A feature is either reliable or it is not.  We'll
never be able to make all kernel allocations reclaimable/moveable so we'll
never be reliable with this approach.  I don't see any alternative to the
never-allocate-kernel-objects-in-removeable-memory approach.
