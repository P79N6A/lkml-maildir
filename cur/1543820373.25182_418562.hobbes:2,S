I asked the same question, Anil said that would/could be done in a
later set of patches, but did not want to change too much code in one
go.

Only by putting extra code at the site of notify_page_fault().  That
would introduce a race against kprobes unregistering a user space
probe.  The race is probably safe, but why risk it?

Only kprobes needs the page fault handler.
Calling kprobe_exceptions_notify() directly would work but again it
introduces races.  The register and unregister are atomic, and remember
how long it took us to agree on how to make atomic register and
unregister race safe.  Using the existing notify chain code gives us
race safe register, call and unregister without having to verify that
any hand written replacement code is also race safe.
You would need to demonstrate that any hand crafted code was race safe
and had enough speed improvement to make the coding and debugging effort
worthwhile.
