Oops... 
I tried your script and it choked on the line following your comment
"clear bits 0, 1, and 3" with the following:
./frank.sh: 08: value too great for base (error token is "08")
Just to clarify my byte/bit problem, if this is before...
50: 08 00 81 14 02 00 40 01 2b 10 55 11 01 00 11 11
I want this for after, right?
50: 00 00 81 14 02 00 40 01 2b 10 55 11 01 00 11 11
since 08 = 00001000 ?
bit:       76543210

I'm getting used to it....
