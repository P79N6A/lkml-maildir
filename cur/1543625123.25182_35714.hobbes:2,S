Btw, here's a program that does a simple histogram of TLB miss cost, and
shows the interesting pattern on intel I was talking about: every 8th miss
is most costly, apparently because Intel pre-fetches 8 TLB entries at a
time.
So on a PII core, you'll see something like
	  87.50: 36
	  12.39: 40
ie 87.5% (exactly 7/8) of the TLB misses take 36 cycles, while 12.4% (ie
1/8) takes 40 cycles (and I assuem that the extra 4 cycles is due to
actually loading the thing from the data cache).
Yeah, my program might be buggy, so take the numbers with a pinch of salt.
But it's interesting to see how on an athlon the numbers are
	   3.17: 59
	  34.94: 62
	   4.71: 85
	  54.83: 88
ie roughly 60% take 85-90 cycles, and 40% take ~60 cycles. I don't know
where that pattern would come from..
What are the ppc numbers like (after modifying the rdtsc implementation,
of course)? I suspect you'll get a less clear distribution depending on
whether the hash lookup ends up hitting in the primary or secondary hash,
and where in the list it hits, but..
