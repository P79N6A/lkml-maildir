Martin,
I ran 2.5.54 with an older version of Erich's NUMA scheduler and
with the version sent out for 2.5.53.  Results were similar:
Kernbench:
                        Elapsed       User     System        CPU
             sched54    29.112s   283.888s     82.84s    1259.4%
          oldsched54    29.436s   286.942s    82.722s    1256.2%
sched54 = linux 2.5.54 with the 2.5.53 version of the NUMA scheduler
oldsched54 = linux 2.5.54 with an earlier version of the NUMA scheduler
The numbers for the new version are actually a touch better, but
close enough to be within a reasonable margin of error. 
I'll post numbers against stock 2.5.54 and include schedbench, tomorrow.
               Michael
