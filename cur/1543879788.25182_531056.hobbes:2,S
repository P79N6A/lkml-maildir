Just some ideas:
- what about using exponents in values?
For example file "voltage" could contain "123 -3" to represent 123 mV.
Exponents could be hardcoded in drivers according to device's range
(so there is no complication in it), but interface is usable in great
range of values. And it is pretty easy to use from userspace.
- interface should allow to present values which are some monotonic
functions of common physical properties. For example when we know
where are some raw data from sensor, but we don't know where are
calibration tables to be able to compute value in some standard unit
(as V for voltage) - in this case it is better to show raw data 
(or raw data after some transformation which makes them monotonic)
and specify that this is raw data than show nothing. 
- it would be nice to know whether presented value is from some
measurement or it is (inaccurate) estimation.
