That makes perfect sense.  Thanks for the explanation.

Correct.  It'd take far too long and I'd go cross-eyed long before I got
anything other than useless garbage.  Isn't this similar to the bug within
the last year that dealt with userland memory disclosure via tcp/icmp?  What
was the "verdict" with that?
Please note that nowhere in my email did I use the word exploit.

Agreed.  It doesn't bother me much at all.  I was just curious what was
going on.
thanks, and keep up the good work,
