It sounds to me like you've got some flakey hardware.  Don't try to save 
the rest of us.  I've been using the Promise drivers with my Ultra 133TX2 
for quite a while now and haven't had _ANY_ problems with it.  I've used 
all of the 2.4.19preXX kernels so far with now issues.  This "problem" 
isn't as wide-spread as you think.
Later,
