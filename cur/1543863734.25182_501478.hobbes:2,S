Subject: [PATCH] Add Micro-Star as a PCI VENDOR
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
I noticed that a common motherboard manufacturer Micro-Star was
missing it's PCI_VENDOR_ID and so I have sent this patch in.
Later on I will send a patch to pci/quirks.c to unhide the SMBus on
the M510C laptop once I have investigated it a bit more. It hides the
SMBus the same as ASUS (and a couple of others) laptops.
This is definately the correct ID, see
http://www.pcidatabase.com/vendor_details.php?id=705
I would also be happy with PCI_VENDOR_ID_MICRO_STAR instead, what do you think?
