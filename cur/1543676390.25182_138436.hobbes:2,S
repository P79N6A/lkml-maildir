Do you understand why processes in D state are unkillable? What do you
think you would gain by killing them, since the memory couldn't be safely
reused? Just not seeing the process in ps?
I can see wanting to avoid having processes in D state, but once you get
such a thing I don't see why the kernel should have a lot of code added to
hide a problem. A reboot *is* a way to kill a process in D state.
In general most of the process should page out, so you only lose some swap
space. I don't get processes in this state, so I can't really check the
RSS and verify that.
Tell the developers how you get the processes in that state and ask for
that to be prevented, and you will find a lot more support.
