On some(/many/most) platforms that isn't a problem.  Platforms
for which it is can just refuse to allocate more than one MSI
at once.

We still should support whatever hardware already exists, if
possible.

Individual drivers can deal with those special cases if they are device-
specific; and the platform can just refuse to do more than one MSI if
something platform-specific would prevent correct operation.
It would be nice to have the MSI and MSI-X interfaces have the same
calling convention; in fact, they can probably be folded into one.
