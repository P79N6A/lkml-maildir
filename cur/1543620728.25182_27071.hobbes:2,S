Being a PPC person, I sometimes wonder if this wsn't a horrible idea
sometimes.  Much of whats in thereshould be in a 'drivers/adb' or so,
ince it's all specific to the ADB bus, with the exception of things like
'rtc.c' (which works on all PPC except APUS).  Keep in mind other
'macintosh' specific drivers, like network ones, are in drivers/net/.
Wer also have an arch/ppc/{8xx,8260}_io/ directories for other
platform-specific drivers, which I want to kill in 2.5.x timeframe.

What excelty are the specific to tho?  Are these all for a new bus?
If these are just variopus network, io, whatnot drivers, just put them
in drivers/whatever.
