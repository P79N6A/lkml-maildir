Noticed that myself too, came to the same conclusion, thanks for the
confirmation thought.

OK, unless we go back to the previous way I'll send this tiny cleanup as
a separate patch to Andrew.

Ah, yes, I've noticed this too, I just wasn't sure on if this would be
wanted or not. Is fixed, thanks!

Hehe, thanks, please do point out my mistakes with the English language.
I have good enough control to convey most of what I intent but I'm not a
native.

How odd, I have the distinct recollection of actually moving that
assignment upwards a few lines, must have been late or something. Thanks
for pointing this out, would've never found it again; with me thinking
it was done with.

Well, you got me. I don't know either, the only thing I can come up with
is making the breakage compile-time (for 3rd-party modules) instead of
subtle run-time, but its still not pretty.
/me looks around at assorted VM gurus; any ideas out there?
If by tomorrow morning CET nobody has spoken up, I'll just go ahead and
accept Hugh's apology :-), that is revert back to my original way of
doing it. (I can always go back to this scheme if some smart but slower
working brain manages a solution)
