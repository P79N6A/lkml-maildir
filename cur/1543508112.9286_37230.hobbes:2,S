that would be nice.  linux-perf contained some discussions about how
to improve the parsability, especially through changes.  the main idea
was to include some kind of metadata, self-description.  another cute
trick was to use seek to skip the metadata, or perhaps even select fields.
when this topic comes up, there's always discussion of formatting,
how some people would prefer a binary interface (as in sysctl or SNMP)
and how it's such a bummer that different versions (and arch's) have 
incompatible shifts in format.

it's not, actually.  this kind of interface will always require a syscall,
and in the face of that, formatting and parsing is trivial.

I think this more reflects the amount of work the kernel has to do to 
collect some of the numbers.  there a couple solutions to this:
selecting only the numbers you want or improving the kernel code.
I can also imagine a kernel system that's specifically designed to 
extract periodic measurements, and buffer them.  then a user-level app
could read whole batches of measurements, with far fewer syscalls.
(not unlike the klog interface, I suppose.)
