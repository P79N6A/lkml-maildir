?? I don't get it.  I'd expect a daemon to be notified and the daemon in
turn to notify me.

A 'make daemon' is exactly what I was thinking of.  The 'too many
directories' think is a problem, see below.

Yes, basic problem.  The notification has to be persistent across
directory open/close.  There had to be a reason why dnotify.c is just
140 lines long, right?  OK, that doesn't mean 'not a chance', it just
means the current implementation is inadequate.  Now at least I can
start writing programs that work this way, try them out, and think about
what has to be done to go the rest of the distance.
Another problem is not handling hard links properly.  That's not ok.

Yes, there are obvious flaws but it's now in and it's obvious where it's
going.  A simple-minded inadequate piece of code that's working beats a
perfect one that exists purely in the imagination, any day. :-)
Do you still have your original proposal around?
