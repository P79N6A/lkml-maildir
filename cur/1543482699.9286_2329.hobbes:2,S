It won't make a difference.  The problem has nothing to do with core files:
they're just a convenient way of triggering it.  Any process which can
reconstruct its address space with mmap can cause a bad configuration.
I wouldn't be too surprised if its the same bug as the ptrace one people have
been complaining about lately.
