Hi,
Yeah this is definitely needed and a nice result.
I'm worried about a) placing a global limit on parallelism, and b)
placing a limit on parallelism at all.
I think it should maybe be a per-zone thing...
What happens if you make it a per-zone mutex, and allow just a single
process to reclaim pages from a given zone at a time? I guess that is
going to slow down throughput a little bit in some cases though...
