That's going to lead to a head-scratching fishing expedition from
support people wondering just why this flag was set.
At the very least we should force the caller to supply a log message
explaining *why* the taint flag is being set and printk it at KERN_ERR
loglevel or higher; so the user API would be
	echo $log > /proc/sys/kernel/taint
rather than manipulating the bit directly.
