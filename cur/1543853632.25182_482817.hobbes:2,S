More update. Got hold of another machine and suspend/resume seems to be
facing problems.
With 2.6.19-rc5-git2
--------------------
- echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep (Suspend to memory takes place)
- Press power button (System tries to come back but fails in MPT adapter
			initialization)
With 2.6.19-rc5-git2 + Reloc patches
------------------------------------
- echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep (Suspend to memory takes place)
- Press power button (Fan powers on but nothing additional is displayed on
			serial console.)
Will do a bisect and try to isolate the problem.
Pavel, I hope my testing procedure is right?
Thanks
Vivek
