Check again, bind-8.x.x (unlike bind-4.x.x) really has this weird bug,
setting linger in main executon thread.

Until recently linux 2.2 ignored finite linger value, translating
it to infinite one. It is fixed though it is wrong: finite linger
values are non-sense: bind dead for 120 seconds is buggy in the same
extent. Actually, almost any application trying to set finite linger
value is broken.

It will help and it is necessary to make bind-8 working.
