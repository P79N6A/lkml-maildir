If I want to prevent the suspend/shutdown from happening, I don't press
the button. If my system insists on not shutting down in order to instead
run out to power while doing something important - I'm not happy, too.
OTOH, maybe you could allocate the storage for the suspend image here instead
of creating HUGE swap space and letting the kernel prevent suspend by using
it or watching the kernel thrash for hours before each OOM.

You can do something like control_alt_delete() - in fact I'm dedicating
400 KB of RAM for "kill -INT 1" on my desktop, not using suspend. Having
an ACPI userspace event is not bad if you intend to use it, but for people
who just want shutdown or suspend to happen, it's overkill.
