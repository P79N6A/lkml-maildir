This issue doesn't seem to reach any kind of resolution so I figured I'd
take a poke at the people responsible. :)
Just to back up the claim that the specs are in the open here are some
links:
http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=
%22Secure+Digital+Card%22+%22Product+Manual%22+site%3Asandisk.com&btnG=Google+Search
Which gives you several PDF:s with enough information to implement a SD
host. The one I've been using is:
