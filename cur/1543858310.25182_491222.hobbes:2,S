Ok, what kind of ass-hat idiotic thing is this?
	irqreturn_t uio_irq_handler(int irq, void *dev_id)
	{
	        return IRQ_HANDLED;
	}
exactly what is the point here? No way will I pull this kind of crap. You 
just seem to have guaranteed a dead machine if the irq is level-triggered, 
since it will keep on happening forever.
Please remove.
YOU CANNOT DO IRQ'S BY LETTING USER SPACE SORT IT OUT!
It's really that easy. The irq handler has to be _entirely_ in kernel 
space. No user-space ass-hattery here.
And I don't care one whit if it happens to work on parport with an old 
legacy ISA interrupt that is edge-triggered. That's not even the 
interesting case. Never will be.
NAK NAK NAK NAK.
