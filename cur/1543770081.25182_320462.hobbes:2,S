Mogens,
With sg_start (in the sg3_utils package) I have tried
to spin up and down an ATA disk inside a USB enclosure
without success. The same command on a USB connected
CD/DVD combo drive did work.
Could you try sg_start on your USB external enclosure
which I assume contains an ATA disk rather than a
SCSI (SPI) disk and report if it works?
BTW I just checked libata (for SATA disks) and it does
not seem to support the START STOP UNIT command.
Jeff, could that one be added?

It is hard to know where to stop with sdparm ;-)
At the moment I am adding transport (protocol) specific
mode page support. So currently sdparm specializes
in mode pages (for all SCSI command sets) and INQUIRY
information (including the device identification VPD
page).
