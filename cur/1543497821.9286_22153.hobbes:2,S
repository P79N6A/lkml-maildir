  Hi, all. Version 107 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This is against 2.3.5. Highlights of this release:
- Added "diunlink" and "nokmod" boot options
- Removed superfluous warning message in <devfs_d_iput>
				Regards,
					Richard....
