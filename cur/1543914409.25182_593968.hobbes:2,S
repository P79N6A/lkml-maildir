Roman, i disagree strongly. I did test with different nice levels. Here 
are some hard numbers: the CPU usage table of 40 busy loops started at 
once, all running at a different nice level, from nice -20 to nice +19:

check a few select rows (the ratio of CPU time should be 1.25 at every 
step) and see that CPU time is distributed very exactly. (and the same 
is true for both -rc6 and -rc6-cfs-devel)
So even in this pretty extreme example (who on this planet runs 40 busy 
loops with each loop on exactly one separate nice level, creating a load 
average of 40.0 and expects perfect distribution after just a few 
minutes?) CFS still distributes CPU time perfectly.
When you first raised accuracy issues i have asked you to provide 
specific real-world examples showing any of the "problems" with nice 
levels you implied to repeatedly:
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/2/38
In the announcement of your "Really Fair Scheduler" patch you used the 
following very strong statement:
    " This model is far more accurate than CFS is [...]"
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/30/307
but when i stressed you for actual real-world proof of CFS misbehavior, 
you said:
    "[...] they have indeed little effect in the short term, [...] "
    
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/2/282
so how can CFS be "far less accurate" (paraphrased) while it has "little 
effect in the short term"?
so to repeat my question: my (and Peter's) claim is that there is no 
real-world significance of much of the complexity you added to avoid 
rounding effects. You do disagree with that, so our follow-up question 
is: what actual real-world significance does it have in your opinion? 
What is the worst-case effect? Do we even care? We have measured it 
every which way and it just does not matter. (but we could easily be 
wrong, so please be specific if you know about something that we 
overlooked.) Thanks,
	Ingo
