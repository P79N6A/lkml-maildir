I don't see any obvious conflict from the log you posted.  For the sake
of comparison, can you post the corresponding dmesg log after you removed
the patch?
acpi_thermal_get_temperature() only evaluates _TMP, which isn't very
interesting.  I wonder if there's some conflict between that AML method
and the EC driver or something.
If you can also collect the DSDT, maybe I can poke around in there and
see what _TMP is really doing.
Thanks,
