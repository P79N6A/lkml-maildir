We could detect those tho. When the appropriate DEBUG option is set, by
storing a cpumask in the semaphore we could detect if it's already taken
on this cpu...

Unless you consider that taking the read semaphore twice on the same CPU
is always a bug, thus the above stuff would work for catching them at
least more often...
