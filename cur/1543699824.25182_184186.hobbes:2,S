The two ports are the same hardware, which makes sense as they
serve the same purpose - serial communication with a slow device.
The common case is one keyboard and one mouse, but two mice
or two keyboards works just as well as long as the software
expects it.  Linux 2.6 have no problems with this.
You need the ruby patch to use the two keyboards independently,
the standard kernel merges input from all attached keyboards into
one console.
You may attach a lot more keyboards using usb keyboards.
