     Is there a reasonable chance that martins patch will get mainlined
     in the near future? One of the big reasons I chose to upgrade to a
     later kernel version (from 2.4.8ac<something>+LVMpatches+...) was
     to get away from having to apply patches (and document which
     patches and where to get them etc). 
     If this is the route I have to go, I'll do it but, well, I'm not
     that comfortable with it.
