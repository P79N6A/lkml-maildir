The single copy from any given cpu assumption was not explicitly made.
Some of this depends on how the administrator/whoever wants to arrange
OS instances so that when one becomes blocked on io or otherwise idled
others can make progress or other forms of overcommitment.

The scenario described above wasn't SSI but independent instances with
a shared distributed fs. SSI clusters have most of the same problems,
really. Managing the systems just becomes "managing the nodes" because
they're not called systems, and you have to go through some (possibly
automated, though not likely) hassle to figure out the right way to
spread things across nodes, which virtualizes pieces to hand to which
nodes running which loads, etc.

But not totally. truncate() etc. need handling, i.e. cross-instance
pagecache invalidations. And write() too. =)

Well, let's try the word "process" then. e.g. 4GB nodes and a process
that suddenly wants to inflate to 8GB due to some ephemeral load
imbalance.
