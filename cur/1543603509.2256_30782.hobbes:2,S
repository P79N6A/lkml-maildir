Indeed. If you're updated a shared library, why not *create a new
file* and then rename it?!? That lets running programmes work fine,
and new programmes will get the new library. Also, the following
construct makes a lot of sense:
	ld -shared -o libfred.so *.o || mv libfred.so /usr/local/lib
Why? Because if ld(1) fails for some reason, and ends up writing a
short file, *you don't want to install the bloody thing*!!! Any new
user would be stuffed (no way around that, even with MAP_COPY).
I don't want to install/upgrade to a half-working library. What's the
point in that?
