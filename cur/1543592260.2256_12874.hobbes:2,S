As far as i know , Regarding Ramdisk linux-2.4.4 and 2.4.1 are similar.
, no body fixed this problem after 2.4.1 , If somebody please let me know .
Anyhow i will try with latest kernel and let you know , but it will take

In my case , If i restart after 5 minutes it works fine , but if i restart
after 1 or 2 minutes kernel hangs during uncompressing ramdisk.
