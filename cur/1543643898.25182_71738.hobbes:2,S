Hi there,
I've noticed, since 2.5.34 (earlier versions down to 2.5.25 didn't boot for 
me), if I want to start X (XFree 4.2.0) and the "r128" module is _not_ loaded 
and the kernel module loader wants to load it, X don't start up, just a 
blank screen and X process uses 100% cpu time. Manually "kill -9" the X stuff 
gives me my terminal back. Again starting X gives the same behaviour. After 
that all, "modprobe r128", starting X again, all works fine.
I really don't have a clue where to debug what wents wrong. Anything I can do 
to provide more detail?
System:
-------
- Celeron 800MHz
- 256 MB RAM
- 60GB IDE hd
- ATI All-In-Wonder 128pro (Rage128 Chipset)
   same with vga=normal and no ati128fb support in the kernel and also with
   applying ati128fb patches and having console framebuffer with
   video=aty128fb:accel,1024x768-8@75
- XFree 4.2.0
- modutils 2.4.19
    /etc/modutils/aliases has: "alias char-major-226 r128" which is the first
    dri card (0)
works as expected with 2.4 kernel tree.
the XFree86.X.log file does not give any usefull things (for me).
Just stopping here:
(II) Loading sub module "ddc"
(II) LoadModule: "ddc"
(II) Reloading /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/libddc.a
(II) R128(0): VESA VBE DDC supported
(II) R128(0): VESA VBE DDC Level none
(II) R128(0): VESA VBE DDC transfer in appr. 2 sec.
and for now uses 100% cpu time.
normally there should come up this after the above:
(==) R128(0): Using gamma correction (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)
(II) R128(0): NEC MultiSync FP1370: Using hsync range of 31.00-65.00 kHz
(II) R128(0): NEC MultiSync FP1370: Using vrefresh range of 55.00-80.00 Hz
(II) R128(0): Clock range:  12.50 to 250.00 MHz
....
Please give me some hints what can be helpfull to debug it and I'll do so :)
I think this a 2.5.xx kernel issue or am I wrong?
