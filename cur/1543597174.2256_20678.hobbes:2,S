Hello Justin and Alan,
There was some garbage printed to the /var/log/messages before the
lockup but it is unreadable.
I'll have to read up on how to connect a serial console to this
machine.  It's our main server (YPserver, mail, http, etc) so I don't
want to use it as a test system.  If I use the append="aic7xxx=verbose"
in my lilo.conf will it log extra messages in /var/log/messages?  If so,
will it be useful enough to figure out what the problem is?
Alan,
Wasn't the old_aic7xxx the default driver up to 2.4.5?  If so I don't
know how using the old driver would help since I had the same problems
with 2.4.[2,3,4].  Unless there was some other stuff that has been fixed
that would cause similar problems.
Cheers.
