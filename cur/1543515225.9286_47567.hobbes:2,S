You mean Documentation/scsi-generic?
I don't understand why people write such documentation without
contacting the glibc developers first.  I've never seen such a request
from anybody regarding the scsi subdirectory.
Instead of writing such lines, it would be better to try to find a
general solution.  I kindly ask the author of this docu to get in
contact with me and tell me exactly the existing problems so that we
can fix this in glibc.
