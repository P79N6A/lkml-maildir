My personal opinion on this is that this is ridiculous.  Given that you
need gcc, binutils, make etc. to build the kernel, and this is more than
inherent, you have to have a pretty bloody strangely constrained system
to disallow Perl, which is as close to a standard Unix utility you can
get without making it into SuS.
The only *real* motivation I have seen for this is a system that as far
I can tell is nothing other than a toy, specifically designed to show
off how little you need to build the kernel.  In other words, it's not a
practical application, it's a show-off art piece.
