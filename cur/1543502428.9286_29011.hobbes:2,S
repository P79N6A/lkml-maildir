(running 2.2.10-ac3)
Using an ATAPI Zip drive (mounted as HDD since the IBM internal one doesn't
come with a jumper on the back to disable the "skip partition table"
behaviour).
I did a "cmp /zip/linux-2.2.10.tar.gz /usr/local/src/linux" and got these
messages:
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 28, key =  4, asc = 47, ascq =  0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:40 (hdd), sector 188368
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 28, key =  4, asc = 47, ascq =  0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:40 (hdd), sector 189372
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 28, key =  4, asc = 47, ascq =  0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:40 (hdd), sector 194254
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 28, key =  4, asc = 47, ascq =  0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:40 (hdd), sector 6838
ide-floppy: hdd: I/O error, pc = 28, key =  4, asc = 47, ascq =  0
end_request: I/O error, dev 16:40 (hdd), sector 14420
So I unmounted the drive, ran e2fsck on it (no errors), then remounted it:
hdd: The drive reports both 100663296 and 100646912 bytes as its capacity
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,64)
 hdd: unknown partition table
hdd: The drive reports both 100663296 and 100646912 bytes as its capacity
VFS: Disk change detected on device ide1(22,64)
 hdd: unknown partition table
I reran the cmp - no problems.  Is this just a temporary error or indicative
of other problems (maybe hardware problems)?
Oddly enough, the memory usage of the computer was staggeringly high earlier
in teh day (128MB mem + 48MB swap => 20K free).  I couldn't see any programs
eating the memory and the kernel wasn't. Closing netscape had no effect, but
killing X-windows (which itself was at 17MB usage IIRC) freed the memory
(leaving me with about 28MB used + buffers (about 100MB actually free IIRC).
Cheers
