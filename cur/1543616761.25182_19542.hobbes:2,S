Here's what I get with 2.4.12-ac3-lowlatency (non-fixed X11 driver):
http://www.pp.song.fi/~visitor/latencytest/3x256.html
And here's 2.4.16-lowlatency (non-fixed X11 driver):
http://www.pp.song.fi/~visitor/latencytest2/3x256.html
Here's 2.4.16-lowlatency with some small patches (fixed X11 driver):
http://www.pp.song.fi/~visitor/latencytest3/3x256.html
Here's 2.4.17-ide-rmap-O1-minill (fixed X11 driver):
http://www.pp.song.fi/~visitor/latencytest4/3x256.html
So, only usable kernel is still 2.4.12-ac3 with fixed X11 driver.
