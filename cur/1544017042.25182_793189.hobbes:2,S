With the help of Paul Mackerras, I have come up with the shell script
below.  You run it with the commit id, the tag of the tree you care
about (e.g. next-20080115)(it defaults to the current top of tree) and
the name of the branch the represents Linus' tree (default to
origin/master).  It will spit out the (or a) tree that contains the
commit you asked about.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
commit=$1
[ "$commit" ] || {
	echo "$0: <commit id> [<top tag> [<linus branch>]]" 1>&2
	exit 1
}
top=$2
[ "$top" ] || top=HEAD
linus=$3
[ "$linus" ] || linus=origin/master
base=$(git merge-base "$linus" "$top")
git log --first-parent --pretty='format:%H %P' "$base".."$top" |
while read m p1 p2
do
	[ "$p2" ] || continue
	git rev-list $base..$p2 | grep -q "$commit" || continue
	branch=$(git show $m | sed -n "s/[ 	]*Merge .* '\([^']*\)'/\1/p")
	tree=${branch%%/*}
	[ "$tree" = "quilt" ] && tree=${branch##*/}
	echo "$tree"
	break
done
exit 0
