Well, I won't argue the use, but I maintain the filesystem, and as long as
I stick to Linux, I intend to continue doing so...
No, it's not only for the loopback device. It can mount 1581 disks as
well, using the normal 3.5" floppy drive. You can also copy a
.d64/.d71/.d81 disk image onto a floppy and mount it that way. (Of course,
the loopback device is better than that solution, but if you don't want
to use the loopback device, you don't have to...)
This, which I consider is the primary advantage of cbmfs (mounting of
1581-floppies, that is), makes the idea of using a user-fs quite
useless.)
[lots of interesting ideas concerning a userfs, with examples, snipped]
