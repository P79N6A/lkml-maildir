Bearing in mind that some casts may have been put in when struct members 
had other values, may be needed on some hardware but not others, etc. 
Cleanups are good, but may not be as obvious as they appear.
Not that there's a lack of places to remove visual cruft, but perhaps 
someone could look at casts and ask if each hides a real type mismatch.
