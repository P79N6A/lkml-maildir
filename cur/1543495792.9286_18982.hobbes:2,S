It does: look at how it's implemented. If a new request arrives before 
the server has committed to disk, and acknowledged, then the latter is 
committed together with the preceding request. In no way does this
break RFC 1094.

Then Linux-2.2 is not something for you...

This is also part of NFSv2 for most commands: look up READ, WRITE,
LOOKUP, CREATE, MKDIR, and most other commands. As for NFSv3, the main
interest is that of speed and 64-bit filesizes; not security. Weak
cache consistency idea gives you very little new information since you
generally have no guarantee that your sunrpc requests are ordered when
using UDP. Please see the NFSv3 patches for how we currently use that
information...
