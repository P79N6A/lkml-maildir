Subject: [PATCH-2.4] Routing interrupts to PCI on TI PCMCIA bridges
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hello, Marcelo and all!
This patch has been in the -ac series for a while and I haven't seen any
reports, positive or negative.
The idea is that if the bridge cannot generate ISA IRQs, it needs to be
reconfigured so that the PCI IRQ can be used.  Some TI bridges are
configured to use ISA interrupts by default, but they cannot do it because
they are connected to the PCI bus only.
I think it's time to put this patch to the main 2.4 branch.  The only
difference from the Alan's branch is that I removed an unhelpful printk,
since the socket is initialized every time the card is re-inserted, and
the message gets annoying.
2.5 kernels take care of this issue in a different way.
