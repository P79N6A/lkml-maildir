The castlewood support line guys swore that the disk doesn't cache.
More reflection, and the fact that partition tables are (partially)
preserved across ejects, leads me to conjecture that the ide driver is
caching *and* not detecting ejects.
The kernel log does *not* show disk change events:
(editted from the dmesg command)

I've got a request in the pipeline with Castlewood for more
specifications of what the linux drivers need to do.  They'd not heard
of this problem before.

PS.  Is there a way to manually force a flush?
