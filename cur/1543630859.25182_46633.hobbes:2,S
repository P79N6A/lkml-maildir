It's not quite as easy (TOPDIR changes with the subdir, CFLAGS are
actually passed to sub-makes, ...), but I got a crude version working 
here. (There's actually a second way to do this more nicely, too).
Anyway, I have pending cleanups to Rules.make, which will make that change
easier too, so I'll just do it step by step.
