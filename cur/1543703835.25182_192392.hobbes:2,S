Hi,
I searched for tg3 in lkml and found one more posting, dealing with these 
problems (subject):
bcm5705 with tg3 driver and high rx load -> bad system responsiveness
There really seems to be a problem. Ronald Wahl pointed out, that the 
driver from
http://www.broadcom.com/drivers/downloaddrivers.php
 does not have the 
problem. Maybe, we could both look for drivers from the hardware producer 
and test them? I will do it when I'm back at work in two weeks.
Regards,
Andreas Hartmann
