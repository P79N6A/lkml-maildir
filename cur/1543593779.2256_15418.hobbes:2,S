Fine. Most user apps can round to the nearest degree, or even
display the values "cool", "warm", "hot", and "BURNING!".
The kernel API should not be so limiting.

The 0.15 may mean the difference between:
a.  less than 0.005 chance of exceeding 370 degrees
b.  less than 0.01 chance of exceeding 370 degrees
for a measurement that might be 365 degrees.

No, at any level of precision. I'd sure want to know if the device
is specified as "resolution 8 degrees, standard deviation 23".
This information is fairly important. The user is responsible for
defining acceptable risk, and the app should be able to provide a
warning or shutdown based on this.
For typical PC hardware, one might assume that the device is a
cheap piece of junk 2 mm below the CPU. (with quite a bit of lag!)
The lag ought to be specified too of course.
