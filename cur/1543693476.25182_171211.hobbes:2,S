Since my code is supposed to run when system is crashing, I would like 
to avoid calling any function in the kernel as far as possible, since 
the kernel and its data structures may be in a inconsistent state 
and/or corrupted.
I do realize that the above code does not provide accurate 
delay and may not work on all platforms. In that direction
I was considering using the loops_per_jiffy variable 
which may provide more accurate/platform-independent delay (?) ..
