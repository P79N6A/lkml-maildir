Backing out 
http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=10dbe196a8da6b3196881269c6639c0ec11c36cb
solves this problem for me. This patch adds memory more than 4G to /proc/iomem
but without 64-bit fields for struct resource it ends up in confusing 
iomem_resource list. I think this patch needs the core 64-bit struct resource
related changes also.
Thanks
