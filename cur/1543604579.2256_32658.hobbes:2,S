    Have used this and has worked great on the machines I've had to use it
on.  Though I'm a bit leery about using it since I figure the generic
2.2.x.preX kernels get a lot more testing that those with this patch
installed.  Also heard of problems using this patch on a VIA PIII SMP
system. :-(  And just went I had been planning to use it on a dual PIII VIA
chipset board too.

    I actually was going to start using this until I learned that 2.2.x
reiser patched kernels couldn't use reiserfs partitions made with 2.4.
:-(  Ended up having to redo an entire system when a downgrade to 2.2.x
became imperitive.  Also the 2.2.x reiser patch lacks the large file support
(on the reiser filesystems created under 2.2.x) and maybe other goodies and
I don't get that back easily by just switching kernels.

    Might give this a try now that it appears to be release quality.

    I'll look into this the next time > 2GB files support becomes needed on
a system.  pre 2.4.x I had been using FreeBSD for such tasks.
