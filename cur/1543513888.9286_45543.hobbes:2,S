    I am running kernel 2.2.13 today, after the all-time glitches on
2.2.12 seems they are still alive. I will wait for the next glitch to
come to send the oops, unfortunately I could not catch it. But a hint is
in that it sent a message saying it wanted to 'kill an idle task'.
I will try to catch it up.
    Thanks,
