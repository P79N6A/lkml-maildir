The Unix world normally expects rather different behaviour
With O_NDELAY set -> no delay but -EAGAIN
Normal -> delay until error or completes or EOF
and the use of poll/select to wait until the event can be issued and is
going to complete. Hence the lack of a mutex_lock_interruptible_timeout()
It's certainly possible to add one but the first question would be "why
do you need it - what sort of API are you trying to build"
