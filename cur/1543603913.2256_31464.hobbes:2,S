This `generation count' idea for file change stamping will eventually
have to go into the kernel if only because things like NFSv4 will
require it.
Meanwhile though, you're going have to look elsewhere than ordinary
NFS to be able to share the generation information over your
network. The current protocols support microsecond(v2)/nanosecond(v3)
timestamps only.
