16-bit pids are biggest part of mj's clustering patches... He switches
to 32 bits then uses space as 8 bit machineid : 16 bit pid. My way to
make patch smaller was to make 2 bit machineid and 14 bits pid, but
that has rather ugly limitation.

PS: So yes, even 16bit PID's are likely to be a problem soon...
