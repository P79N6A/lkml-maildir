Thanks!  This issue is with an older RT kernel that I am running.  In the
version of the kernel I am running nmi_enter() and nmi_exit() are commented
out as described here:
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0508.1/1714.html
Newer RT kernels (such as linux-2.6.18-rt5) have reenabled the
add_preempt_count/sub_preempt_count calls in nmi_enter/exit.  If I
understand correctly the reason one could not modify the preempt_count
from NMI code is that it could have been in the process of being
modified by non-NMI code.  But, in recent RT kernels it appears that
preempt_count is still a single word modified by both NMI and
non-NMI code.  What am I missing that now makes this safe?
