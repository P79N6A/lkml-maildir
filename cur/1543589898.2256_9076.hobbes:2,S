Doesn't 2.4.1-ac1 onwards contain:
o	Workaround code for APIC problems with ne2k	(Maciej Rozycki)
	| this will break original 82489DX devices for now
	| ie _very_ early dual pentium boards
Got good reviews at the time, and I thought it was more general than
ne2k.  I don't remember it going forward to Linus (but I've not looked).
