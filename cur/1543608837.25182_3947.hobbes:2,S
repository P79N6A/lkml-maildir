Hi,
I have the pleasure to announce (initial) DVD+RW support for Linux 2.4
kernel. Code and technical ramblings are available at
http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/linux/DVD
+RW/. Note (and respect) that I'm
not subscribed to the linux-kernel list and would appreciate if you drop
me a CC when (or if:-) commenting.
Enjoy. Andy.
