	Sorry, what are you smoking? If they are private members, _all_
local filesystems become ones too. Along with swap. Along with anything
that uses swap. E.g. shm handling. Or VM in general. And you are saying
that it's not a layering violation? Mind boggles... Just what is _not_ a
private member of blockdevice? pipes and sockets handling + (hopefully)
process management? Could you pass me that pot? Thank you.

	Smashing major/minor is fine and it's in my queue. However, it's
_not_ the same as smashing b/c. Block devices are not subclass of files.
They are independent entities and they are used as such in a lot of
places. Trying to channel it through file interface is utterly bogus - try
to estimate the amount of layering violations and you'll see. What you
have is either a class derived both from file and block device _or_ a
constructor making former from the latter. Take your pick. I prefer the
second POV.

And? It implements device methods via calls of file ones (of underlying
file). Just as the glue code in drivers + block_dev.c implement file
methods via calls of block device ones (of underlying device). How it is
different?
