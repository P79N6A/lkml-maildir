Actually, about the i386 case, I am trying to get my head around the
locked cmpxchg8b issue.
I just implemented what would look like something that could be added to
the standard cmpxchg on i386:
union pack64 {
        u64 value;
        struct {
                u32 low, high;
        };
};
static inline u64 cmpxchg8b(u64 * ptr, u64 old, u64 new)
{
        union pack64 oldu;
        union pack64 newu;
        union pack64 prevu;
        oldu.value = old;
        newu.value = new;
        __asm__ __volatile__("cmpxchg8b (%6)\n\t"
                             : "=d"(prevu.high), "=a" (prevu.low)
                             : "0" (oldu.high), "1" (oldu.low),
                               "c" (newu.high), "b" (newu.low),
                               "m"(*__xg(ptr))
                             : "memory");
        return prevu.value;
}
I tried it with and without the LOCK prefix on my Pentium 4.
Locked cmpxchg8b : 90 cycles
Non locked cmpxchg8b: 30 cycles
sti: 166 cycles
cli: 159 cycles
So, hrm, even if we use the locked version, it is still much faster than
the sti/cli. I am thoughtful about the comment in asm-i386/system.h:
/*
 * The semantics of XCHGCMP8B are a bit strange, this is why
 * there is a loop and the loading of %%eax and %%edx has to
 * be inside. This inlines well in most cases, the cached
 * cost is around ~38 cycles. (in the future we might want
 * to do an SIMD/3DNOW!/MMX/FPU 64-bit store here, but that
 * might have an implicit FPU-save as a cost, so it's not
 * clear which path to go.)
 *
 * cmpxchg8b must be used with the lock prefix here to allow 
 * the instruction to be executed atomically, see page 3-102
 * of the instruction set reference 24319102.pdf. We need
 * the reader side to see the coherent 64bit value.
 */
I just re-read 24319102.pdf page 3-102. Here is what seems to be the
reference used:
"This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the
instruction to be executed atomi cally. To simplify the interface to the
processor’s bus, the destination operand receives a write cycle without
regard to the result of the comparison. The destination operand is
written back if the comparison fails; otherwise, the source operand is
written into the destination. (The processor never produces a locked
read without also producing a locked write.)" (page 3-102)
However, we find _exactly_ the same comment about the cmpxchg
instruction:
"This instruction can be used with a LOCK prefix to allow the
instruction to be executed atomi cally. To simplify the interface to the
processor’s bus, the destination operand receives a write cycle without
regard to the result of the comparison. The destination operand is
written back if the comparison fails; otherwise, the source operand is
written into the destination. (The processor never produces a locked
read without also producing a locked write.)" (page 3-100)
Since we use the standard cmpxchg without lock prefix and consider it
atomic wrt the local CPU, I wonder why we could not do the same for
cmpxchg8b ? Any idea ?
It could then give you 8 bytes cmpxchg atomical wrt the local CPU for 30
cycles, which is really not so bad! Or is there any undocumented
funkyness about cmpxchg8b I should be aware of ?
