No, he didn't.  He reran the build by hand.  Sorry, but there appears to
a bug somewhere in our build system (or one of the tools it is using)
that very occasionally loses a line of the log.  We are trying to track
it down.

I have applied this patch to today's linux-next, so that this particular
bug will not prevent the m68k builds.  I am hoping someone will pick it
up (or an equivalent patch) so I can drop it again.
