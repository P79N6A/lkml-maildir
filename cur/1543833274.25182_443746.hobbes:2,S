Cheap and simple access to topology information would be interesting.
Glibc just wants to know if our kernel is SMP so it can know if it is
ok to busy wait for a bit waiting for a mutex.  Or if busy waiting is
a complete loss.
The practical challenge is that topology information is not fixed but
potentially varies at runtime.
Ulrich what would be interesting besides the possibility of having
multiple cpus?
