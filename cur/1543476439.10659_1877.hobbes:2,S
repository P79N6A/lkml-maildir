I like the way this patch works, however the modules will silently fail
to work (i.e. probably crash, screw up MMIO or whatever) with many
page_offset addresses unless you include this too (from your other
patch):

As a nice side effect, this will also compile to better code in some
cases.  Unfortunately, this is reputed to cause problems with some
broken drivers; looks like the only way to win here is fix those
drivers.
