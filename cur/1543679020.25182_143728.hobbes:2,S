For what it is worth, I have this on bkbits.net:
    ServerWorks OSB4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 79
    ServerWorks OSB4: chipset revision 0
    ServerWorks OSB4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
and I ran 2.4.21 for a day or so before chickening out and downgrading to
2.4.20.  I did not see any errors and I did run a full set of integrity
checks over all the data (BK checks, not an fsck, BK checks read and 
checksum all the data).
I did get what looked like nasty corruption under 2.5.70.
