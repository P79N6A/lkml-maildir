Hi,
I've experiensed something with my laptop (Uniwill):
It sometimes locks up when I've booted up, and the powerbutton sometimes
help, other times it just powers off.
it has happend for me since kernel 2.4.3, but since by laptop is buggy I
thought it something wrong with it. seams I was wrong..

Subject: ACPI+HP omnibook -- freeze until power is pressed?
Hi!
I'm seeing strange thing on hp omnibook... I work on console, and
machine suddenly locks up without me doing anything strange. So I
press powerbutton for a short while, and ... machine continues to work
as if nothing happened. Not even keyboard presses are lost.
But its annoying, anyway. 2.4.14-acpi. Happened ~10 times so
far. Anyone seen something similar?
Pavel
