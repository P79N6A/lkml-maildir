and what essentially every line of kernel code does today.  (There are
random spots of brokenness, but they get fixed over time.)

Your eyes are broken then ... or maybe you're focussing exclusively
on code that violates the most basic coding guidelines like:
	if (...) {
		THAT WAS ONE MORE TAB
	}
and
	for (...) {
		THAT WAS ALSO ONE MORE TAB
	}
Come on, stop wasting everyone's time with utter nonsense.
	- Indent always uses tabs
	- When breaking long lines (including long conditions)
		* STILL indent with tabs
		* ... and more than one, to be "substantially" more indented
That's what Documentation/CodingStyle says **TODAY** so stop with the flamage.
