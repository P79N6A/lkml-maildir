Honestly, I don't care at all about building the code.  If that's what 
you want, great.
My objection is more to adding a samples/ directory, which is contra to 
past experience:
A new net driver sample should go in drivers/net/ like the existing 
skeleton files I already listed, not samples/net/.  A top-level 
"samples/" seems like it exists only duplicate the rest of the tree 
hierarchy.
