Not sure if its a bug or a feature ;-) but it does give the message
that its going to take a long time and if I want to make it shorter I
should use scsi emulation and not ide. I don't understand enough about
these to know where the problem lies I'm afraid.
Anyway I got the output of dmesg and was hoping it could shed some more
light on the problem. Seems like a problem with isofs from that:
cdrom: open failed.

cdrom: open failed.
Attached scsi generic sg0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 0, lun 0,  type 5
