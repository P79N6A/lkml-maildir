* Latest maintenance release 1.3.2 is out from the 'maint' branch.
* The 'master' branch has these since the last announcement, not
  counting what is in v1.3.2.
 - blame path-pruning fix (Fredrik Kuivinen)
 - built-in push (Linus, Johannes Schindelin)
 - beginning of "put remotes/ info in config file" (Johannes Schindelin)
 - repo-config updates and fixes (Johannes Schindelin)
 - built-in count-objects and diff
 - core.prefersymlinkrefs can be given to use symlink HEAD;
   this may be needed to bisect kernel history before January
   2006 whose setlocalversion script depended on HEAD being a
   symlink.
 - "git-log --parents" fix (Linus)
 - use rev-list instead of log in git-cvsserver (Martin Langhoff)
 - sha1_to_hex() usage cleanup (Linus)
 - Document update-index --unresolve (Matthias Kestenholz)
* The 'next' branch, in addition, has these.
 - "put remotes/ info in config file" for fetch side (Johannes Schindelin)
 - built-in grep
   It now knows all the common grep options I personally use,
   including -l, -w, -E, -i, -[ABC]<n>, -v; I am planning to
   push this out perhaps mid next week.
 - built-in format-patch WIP
   I really should resume working on this again...
 - cache-tree
   Fixed a rather nasty bug; should be safe again to use it now.
 - get_sha1(): :path and :[0-3]:path to extract from index.
 - diff-delta enhancements (Nicolas Pitre)
* The 'pu' branch, in addition, has these.
 - partial tree reading/writing with --prefix option.
 - Transitively read alternatives (Martin Waitz)
