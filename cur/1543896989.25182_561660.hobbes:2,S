That'sthe NVIDIA module, which isn't doing much with X shut down
regardless. It was bad form to forget this, of course, but is unrelated
to the problem.

I know. This isn't ext3 related and I'm fairly certain drivers/net/atl1
is trashing... something. Perhaps the page table because:
[  153.785325] Bad page state in process 'scp'
[  153.785327] page:ffff81000308d020 flags:0x0040ad41dc050845

[  153.785329] Trying to fix it up, but a reboot is needed
This one dismisses a reference counting issue because the page data here
looks like garbage. And a panic in VLC, playing a video across the
network hits a similar problem:

My apologies, I had thought the etiquette was to only include
maintainers on the CC list.
I'll try and locate a maintainer for the Attansic driver a bit later,
but I've only seen people loosely related to it. In any case we may as
well let this thread die because it's not related to a filesystem bug
(which the CC list is presumably interested in).
