If the device actually supports multiple vectors (not all do), I think 
they should show up as separate interrupts in /proc/interrupts and you 
can either set the affinity manually, or maybe irqbalance is smart 
enough for this.
Careful, though, as in some cases this may reduce performance due to 
causing more cache line bouncing between CPUs.
