Non exec stack will not protect from that if it is designed to work on it
( and majority of exploits today are designed for that. )

No, I'm not a kernel hacker, and far away of thinking i'm one...
Maybe i will be when i will get some free time to involve myself more
in kernel development ( ie: when i'll be ending all my user space
projects, and maybe when you'll stop wasting my time sending
your 'getting nowhere' mail with me answering instead of coding 
( note that i'm also too dumb to stop answering) ).
but, in contrast to you, i'm listening to what other people say and trust
them... at least, if i do not understand, i ask.
But i do not start a thread getting nowhere basically saying:
"no, you're all wrong, you *must* include this patch,
and ne stack are usefull".
In the technical discution i was pointing to you, 
there was ton of argument against using non executable stack...

you're really playing with people and trying maintain a flamebait,
as a proof, i just found this lkml archive :
http://x71.deja.com/getdoc.xp?AN=566786875&CONTEXT=962629206.727122024&hitnum=0
dating of 31 Dec 1999 where someone is explaining you things about ne stack,
and *also* explaining you that Linus *said* it was giving a False sense of
security... ( and yes, he said it, but i can't find the involved thread ).
Now, please stop getting nowhere and take too people there time...

huh ? so you prefer buggy code instead of clean & bugfree one ?

There is userspace & almost clean way to protect yourself 
from stack overflow attack. Theses was mentioned sooner in this thread.

     It is well known that M$ products don't call free() after a malloc().
     The Unix community wish them good luck for their future developments.
