Interesting find, I should pay attention to that :-)
But - note to dquigley - AFAICS, an LSM needs to _explicitly_ call
the next LSM's function. No one (just a minimal grep in
linux-2.6/security/) besides SELinux does that today. So
while you could load AppArmor ontop of MultiAdm, it would never
be invoked. This is what is known as "sufficient" in PAM parlance.
SELinux OTOH is in "required" mode [again PAM-speak].
