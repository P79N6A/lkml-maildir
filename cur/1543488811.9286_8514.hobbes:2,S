What the heck is the driver doing?
A mmap() will keep the file count updated, so the driver has to do _extra_
work in order to free some memory before all mmap areas have gone away. 
The file->release() thing is called after the very last "fput" of the file
(ie after all fd's have been closed AND all memory mappings have been
removed).
This patch looks like extra code to get around some other driver bug, and
I'd much rather just see the driver fixed properly.
