You're fixing the conflict anyway since it's little, correct?

Ok, I'm going to test that out in the offending configuration. If that works, 
then Jeff will explain us why the same (rephrased) patch didn't work in 2.4 
and works in 2.6. When we have an explaination about that, I'll be very happy 
about merging the patch.
For myself, I don't even know why it didn't work in 2.4, I 
hadn't the knowledge and haven't the time.
People got breakage and when searching for it that looked the most invasive 
change, so I suggested removing and tests confirmed that.
However, for now it seems that I can't reproduce anyway the iptables crash, 
and even Jeff did some testing... so it seems it's ok.
