Subject: New IrDA drivers for 2.6.X

	Hi Dave,
	Martin Diehl has finished converting all the old style dongle
driver to the new API. This was the last major feature parity issue
with 2.4.X, with this work, 2.6.X should support all the IrDA serial
dongles that 2.4.X supports. Martin also did a few other cleanups and
fixed tekram-sir so that it works with real hardware.
	All patches depend on the first patch, and the last patch
depend on the previous patches. I tested this on 2.6.2-rc1 with an
actisys dongle, neither Martin or I have hardware to test the other
dongle drivers.
	Thanks for pushing that to "you know who" ;-)
	Jean
