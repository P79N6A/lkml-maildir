Mozilla uses C++ mainly as "extended C" - due to compatibility concerns.
Try compiling something like Qt/KDE/gtk-- which are really heavy on
templates (with all the benefits and drawbacks of that).
My code here is quite template heavy, and I suspect that's what's triggering
it.  In fact, I can't compile our development code with optimization, because
GCC runs out of memory (it only allocates some 300-500 MB, but each page has
it's own map in /proc/pid/maps, and a wc -l /proc/pid/maps doesn't finish for
minutes).  My typical GCC eats 100-200 MB and runs for several minutes.
You should benchmark this particular case with code that makes GCC eat
lots of memory, 100MB or more.  I've never seen Mozilla really make GCC
eat that much memory  -  other projects do.
