Good catch.  I will up level the cpuset check in buffered_rmqueue rather
then doing it in get_page_from_freelist.  That should retain the current
preferences for local pages.

Na. This for most cases will be ZONE_DMA pcp list having nothing much
most of the time.  And picking any other zone randomly will be exposed
to faulty behavior.
