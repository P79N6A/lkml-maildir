Now that chains of syscalls can be way more easily handled with clets^wthreadlets,
why would we need the whole syslets crud inside?
Why can't aio_* be implemented with *simple* (or parallel/unrelated) 
syscall submit w/out the burden of a complex, limiting and heavy API (I 
won't list all the points against syslets, because I already did it 
enough times)? The compat layer only is so bad to not be even funny.
Look at the code. Only removing the syslets crud would prolly cut 40% of 
it. And we did not even touch the compat code yet.
