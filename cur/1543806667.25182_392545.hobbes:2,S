Good point but I'd say that this was an instance when you didn't want to 
bail out of the load balance.  E.g. during idle balancing the very first 
task moved would trigger it regardless of its priority.  Also, if the 
task was of sufficiently high priority for it to warrant bailing out of 
the load balance why wasn't the current task (i.e. why didn't it preempt 
on its current CPU).

I disagree.  A bunch of work is done to determine which CPU to pull from 
and how many tasks to pull and then it will bail out before any of them 
are moved (and for no good reason).

Clearly, the way to handle this is to impose some limit on the number of 
tasks to be moved or split large moves into a number of smaller moves 
(releasing and reacquiring locks in between).  This could be done in the 
bits of code that set things up before move_tasks() is called.

Well, you seem to have succeeded in starting a discussion :-)
