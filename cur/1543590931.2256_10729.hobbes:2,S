Speaking of queues on routers/servers, does such a util exist that would
measure (even a rough estimate), what level of congestion (queueing) is
happening between point A and B ?  I'd be curious how badly congested some
things upstream from me are......   I know I can use ping or
traceroute ... but they don't report queueing or bursting.  Both measure
latency and packetloss ... short of stareing at a running ping that is
... <G>
