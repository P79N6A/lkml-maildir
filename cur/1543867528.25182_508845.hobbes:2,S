Subject: [patch 1/2] fs: fix libfs data leak
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

simple_prepare_write leaks uninitialised kernel data. This happens because the
it leaves an uninitialised "hole" over the part of the page that the write is
expected to go to. This is fine, but it then marks the page uptodate, which
means a concurrent read can come in and copy the uninitialised memory into
userspace before it written to.
Fix it by simply marking it uptodate in simple_commit_write instead, after
the hole has been filled in.  This could theoretically break an fs that uses
simple_prepare_write and not simple_commit_write, and that relies on the
incorrect simple_prepare_write behaviour. Luckily, none of those exists in the
tree.
