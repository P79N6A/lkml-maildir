It doesn't if we simply declare that a certain chunk of memory is
available to it, for the case where it runs in the native configuration.
Since it doesn't have to support *any* ELF file, just the kernel one,
that's an option.
On the other hand, I guess with the decompressor/ELF parser being PIC,
one would simply look for the highest used address, and relocate itself
above that point.  It's not really all that different from what the
decompressor does today, except that it knows the address a priori.

Again, it's an option.  The downside is that you don't get the automatic
test coverage of having it be exercised as often as possible.
