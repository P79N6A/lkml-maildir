Forget it.
You will not act as my advocate, and just in case this isn't clear, I
herewith EXPRESSLY FORBID anyone to represent me or my opinions unless
he has a PRIOR, WRITTEN and HAND-SIGNED authorization of mine.
I for sure will not issue one to you, but I may provide IBM with a copy
of this and your mail so they can show to the court you're trying to
deceive the court.
Now stop wasting our time and hop off.
