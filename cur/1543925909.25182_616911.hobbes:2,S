That seems a little higher standard than patches are normally held to.
How about the patches get sent to the appropriate people at IBM (who are
they?) and if we haven't heard a NAK from them after a month, then they
get applied?

I'm pretty sure that Windows uses the _SUN information, so I think this
is going to be well-tested.

Well, yes, it doesn't take kernel effort if you're willing to build
proprietary knowledge into a userspace program.  This seems similar
to the argument that filesystems don't need to be in the kernel since
they can be implemented in user space.  They work better in the kernel,
just like this does.
By the way, the end result of this should be a pci-hotplug system that has
much less code in the drivers, more uniformity between the presentation
to userspace, more functionality and is easier to understand.
