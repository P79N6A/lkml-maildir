Hi, All
In April 4, Andrew Morton posted a patch to fix a memory leak in
ext3.

>The patch teaches journal_unmap_buffer() about buffers which are on

Andrew's patch modifies JBD to delete pages which are connected to
t_locked_list and due to be truncated.  But how about pages on
t_sync_datalist?  I think these pages won't be deleted and left in
the LRU list.
The buffers connected to t_sync_datalist can't simply be removed like
the buffers connected to t_locked_list, since we don't know if the
I/O against the buffers are complete.
So we should wait until the committing transaction becomes complete
if there are any buffers connected to the transaction's
t_sync_datalist.
I made a patch to do the following.
a) If a buffer is connected to t_sync_datalist in the transaction
   (jh->b_jlist == BJ_SyncData) on journal_unmap_buffer(),
   journal_unmap_buffer() returns -1, so that caller can wait for the
   completion of the transaction.
b) If journal_unmap_buffer() returns -1 on journal_invalidatepages(),
   call log_wait_commit() to wait for the completion of the
   transaction, and retry to call journal_unmap_buffer() again.
Below is the comparison of the memory leak rate before and after this
fix.  We counted them from (Active+Inactive)-(Cached+Buffers+SwapCached
+Mapped), which are in /proc/meminfo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Linux 2.6.13-rc3 (including Andrew's patch):
  leaked-rate   = 4869 KB/h
  (leaked memory = 53564 KB, 11 hours)
  
My patch applied:
  leaked-rate   = 213 KB/h
  (leaked memory = 1492 KB, 7 hours)

Here is the patch against 2.6.13-rc3.
