Yeah, the patch was a first attempt at getting better global fairness for 
unpinned tasks. I expected there'd be latency problems when unpinned and 
pinned tasks co-exist. The original code for vruntime adjustment in 
set_task_cpu() helped alleviate this problem, so removing it in my patch 
would definitely bring the problem back. On the other hand, leaving it 
there broke global fairness in my fairness benchmark. So we'd need a 
better compromise.
Were the experiments run on a 2-CPU system? When Xorg experiences large 
wait time, is it on the same CPU that has the two pinned tasks? If this is 
the case, then the problem could be X somehow advanced faster and got a 
larger vruntime then the two pinned tasks, so it had to wait for the 
pinned ones to catch up before it got a chance to be scheduled.
