Whoa there...  this buffer isn't allocated by just ANY thread that has
contention on the lock... it's only allocated if the thread that OWNS the
lock reenters printk... so in all cases that don't cause deadlock now,
behavior is identical...
Is there a kmalloc flag that you can pass that says not to sleep?  I'm not
too familiar with that area... 
Thanks,
