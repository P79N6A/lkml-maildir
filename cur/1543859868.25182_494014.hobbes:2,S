I didn't need to run a specific test for this.  The normal workload of the
machine approximates a continuous selftest for almost the last year.
Large files (4-12GB is typical) are being continuously packed and unpacked
with gzip and bzip2.  Statistical analysis of the datasets is followed by
verification of the data, sometimes using diff, or md5sum, or python
scripts using numarray to mmap 2GB chunks at a time.  The machine
often goes for days with a load level of 20+ and 32GB RAM + another 32GB
swap in use.  It would be very unlikely for data corruption to go unnoticed.
When I first got the machine I did have some problems with disks being
dropped from the RAID and occasional log messages implicating the IOMMU.
But that was with kernel 2.6.16.?, Kernels since 2.6.17 haven't had any
problem.
