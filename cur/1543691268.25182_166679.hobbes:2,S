Thanks for the reply. This is the only time this has ever happened. How can
I make out if it is a memory error? Is there any way by which I can test it?
Thanks & Regards,

Typically an NMI is a system error. That could be a memory error, it
could be a freak power glitch if its only ever happened once.
If you are using a 2.4.7 kernel you really should also update to the
current errata kernel and other updates.
