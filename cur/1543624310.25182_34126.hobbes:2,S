NO NO NO! This is the same broken patch that somehow got into
2.2.21pre4 as well. The patch changes the code to write to the
IA32_MC0_CTL MSR, which is a big no-no. Intel's IA32 Vol3 manual
(#245472-03) sections 13.3.2.1 and 13.5 make that point quite clear.
I have several P6 boxes that hang hard in MCE init trying to boot
vanilla 2.2.21pre4 and 2.4.19-pre3. The issue is real.
Please apply the backup patch below.
