Perhaps a server could be supported by advertising.
Another idea would be local area support. For example,
an ISP or university could support their customers.
In this case, abuse could be reduced by restricting
the config options to hardware that was sold back
in the 386 era. Maybe even add code to prevent booting
on the 486 and above.
