It's a shame we don't have a way to measure IRQ latency - it would be
very useful to flag up problems.
I think the best we could do is to arrange for the timer interrupt to
complain if it's delayed by more than 1ms or so - but some architectures
already run their timers with IRQF_DISABLED as a work around some of
the latency issues.
