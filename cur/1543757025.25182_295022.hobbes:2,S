Dear All
   When i start the non- compressed kernel, it can print out "Linux
version 2.4.18-rmk4", and when i bootup the compressed kernel ,
"uncompressed linux ......" is displayed. Both situation will reboot
the machine and come back to the bootloader. Do anybody know what is
the problem? Do i set anything wrong? Where should i start to debug in 
kernel?
best regard
Mike,Lee
