I didn't say XMMS skips when X is reniced at -20 :-)
It's Juk the one that skips and, as one LKLM reader said, it has to do
with the fact that aRTS had less priority than X.

Can't follow you reasoning. I think the scheduler should work for any
priority, either negative (the most) or possitive (the least). In fact,
some kernel threads are reniced negatively since they need full
priority.
