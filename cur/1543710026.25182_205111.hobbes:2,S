Hi again,
please read my last mail carefully: 
"33% procs faster on icc, 66% faster on gcc"
means that gcc (GNU) is superior. But the patch is a preliminary 
version...
greetings, Ingo.

Hi All!!

Really???
If it is ture using icc 66% faster than gcc., It is wonderful. 
Could you show us detail data to  lmbench results.
Thanks!!
