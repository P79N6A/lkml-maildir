It does still "run" on most everything but it's naive to think that you can do 
anything and everything on 10-year-old hardware.  Choose ext3 and Linux still 
runs just fine.  And honestly I doubt that ext4 will show much problem either.
ext4 is being developed primarily to address scaling issues at the high end of 
the storage spectrum.  If you're concerned about carrying 64-bit containers, 
just use ext3, and be happy with your 32-bit, < 16TB filesystems, I'd say.
