It does if it consumes the skb (then it returns skb->len).
But the skb have not to be freed imediately in this case, it maybe
queued or used until all bytes are written to the physical device.
If it returns any other value the skb is not freed.
This logic came from using skb for transparent data too.
Here it was possible, that the hw driver only take some bytes from the
skb (so it returns < skb->len), then the isdn layer should requeue
the skb so no transparent data get lost.
But this mechanism was never used in drivers, only 3 states:
The driver accept the packet then it is responsible for the skb
and return skb->len or the driver do not accept it (e.g. buffer full,
conntection is going down), then it return 0 and does not free the
skb.
If some internal error in the HW driver occur, it should return a
negative value and it also do not free the skb.
