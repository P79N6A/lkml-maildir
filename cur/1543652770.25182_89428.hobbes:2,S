OSDL is vendor neutral, by definition. Besides, we all know
that Transmeta hosts ftp.kernel.org and Red Hat hosts vger
(for varying definitions of "hosts", but you know what I mean).
I do not see acceptance suffer, because we do not observe
Transmeta or Red Hat pushing their agendas. Same with OSDL.
I'm more interested in contacting the admin to be a component
owner for sparc, for instance. Someone is going to have a significant
admin load, because Bugzilla is not going to be self-running.
Who is that person?
