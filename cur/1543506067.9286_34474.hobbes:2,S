Subject: PROBLEM: 2.2.11 'Out of memory' on 256MB DELL WS400 in minutes!

New problem in 2.2.11.
I have been tracking new 2.2 kernel releases due to the bug(s) in the vortex 
(3c59x.c) driver which caused a crash about once a day with freeing a bad 
skbuf pointer. Yesterday and today I tried 2.2.11 but it has a new and much 
worse problem; all the memory seems to bleed away very rapidly sometimes 
within minutes of usage.  The machine is a 256MB DELL WS400.
The console reports 'Out of memory for <processname>' sort of messages and the 
machine goes unrecoverable (reset button time). I tried discarding my patched 
kernel tree and starting from a clean 2.2.11 but with no difference (I used 
2.2.10 to compile it for what its worth, since the 2.2.11 doesnt stay up long 
enough).
I selected the default 1GB option for the new config option.
The machine has aic7xxx scsi and 3c59x vortex ethernet and is a DELL WS400.
Any suggestions please,
Richard.
