   This adds the CPUFreq driver for mobile AMD Opteron/Athlon64 processors.
+   An acpi interface is available if acpi support has been selected.
+   This is required for multi-socket and other systems but not 
necessarily required for UP single socket systems.
 
   For details, take a look at <file:Documentation/cpu-freq/>.
 
   If in doubt, say N.

+     This provides access to the acpi tables for full p-state 
functionality. This driver is also required
+     for cpufreq to work with multi-socket and other smp systems.
+     
+     It is safe to say Y here.
