Hi, has anyone tried compiling kernel 2.3.39 on LinuxPPC (for powermac)?
When I go "make zImage" I get errors saying "includes/asm/ipcbuf.h not
found" and "includes/asm/sembuf.h not found".
Well, there weren't ipcbuf.h or sembuf.h in "includes/asm-ppc" either so I
copied "includes/asm-m68k/ipcbuf.h" and "includes/asm-m68k/sembuf.h" into
"includes/asm" dir, but that didn't help either.  Now I get thousands of
syntax errors.
Any ideas?  Thank you.
