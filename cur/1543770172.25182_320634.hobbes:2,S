Do you have a new set of benchmarks we could see?  The ones you had for 
v10 were pretty useful.
> o Removed all the additional buddy allocator statistic code
Is there a separate patch for the statistic code or is it no longer 
being maintained?

Why are kernel nonreclaimable and kernel reclaimable joined here?  I'm 
not saying you are wrong, I'm just ignorant and need some education.

Instead of defining 0 and 1 in a comment why not use a #define?

The #define would make code like this look more readable.
