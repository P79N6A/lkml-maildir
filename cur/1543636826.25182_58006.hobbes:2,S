Maybe you can help me merge some of these over.  You are right, the
differences are great.  I tried to only bring over overcommit-related
fixes but it was tough.  Compounded by the new stuff Hugh sent us, it
was hard to tell what was what.
The only thing that is in the patch now re shmem is the basic accounting
and checks.  I removed all of Hugh's updates...
