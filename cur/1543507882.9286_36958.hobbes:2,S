Andreas already suggested extending sysinfo() to cover this. As I
mentioned earlier, the only real argument so far has been the number
of CPUs (and maybe the FPU type for cases like the m68k).
Phillip> Why not have both?  Keep /proc/cpuinfo for the perl script,

Compiling Linux to not use /proc is pretty much going to render your
system useless.
