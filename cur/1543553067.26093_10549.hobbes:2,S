on our servers it arrived only when the swap is used. for exemple:
there is too many requests on the web server, machine begins to swap,
after 3-4 minutes we have the first VM errors. it is too late. 
the solutions: reboot server / unplug cable / cut port 80 on the router 
and wait ... after 3-4 minutes server rebegins to work finely. If you do 
not touch the swap you have never this problem. another solution is to 
put lot of ram ;)
