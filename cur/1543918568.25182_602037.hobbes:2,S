Yes, I think you are reading that right.

Correct.  And though I eventually realized the nonlinear dirty accounting
issue (which I did highlight in the patch comment), I'd forgotten all
about needing CONFIG_HIGHPTE in addition to CONFIG_HIGHMEM - yes, that
increased the probability of overlooking it too.
No excuses that we did miss it in all these months those patches have
been around; but it's an object lesson in the trouble rare paths give.
