Subject: Races in affs_unlink(), affs_rmdir() and affs_rename()

mkdir /A
mkdir /B
mkdir /C
touch /A/a
ln /A/a /B/b
ln /A/a /C/c
rm /A/a &
rm /B/b
can corrupt filesystem. Scenario:
unlink("/B/b") locks /B, removes "b" and unlocks /B. Then it calls
affs_remove_link(), which blocks.
unlink("/A/a") locks /A, removes "a" and unlocks /A. Then it calls
affs_remove_link(). Which locks /B, renames removed entry into "b",
removes old "b" and inserts renamed "a" into /B.
The rest is irrelevant - we're already in it.
Similar race exists between unlink() and rename();
mkdir /A
mkdir /B
mkdir /C
touch /A/a
touch /B/a
ln /A/a /B/b
ln /A/a /C/c
rm /A/a &
mv /B/a /B/b
- similar scenario, different source of affs_remove_header().
Another one: unlink() and rmdir():
mkdir /A
mkdir /B
touch /A/a
ln /A/a /B/a
rm /A/a &
rmdir /B
Since you don't lock /B for affs_empty_dir(), you can hit the
window between removing old /B/a and inserting renamed /A/a into /B.
Notice that VFS _does_ lock /B (->i_zombie), but affs_remove_link()
for /A/a doesn't even look at it.
Same thing for rename()/rmdir() (rmdir victim contains a link to rename
target, apply the previous scenario).
