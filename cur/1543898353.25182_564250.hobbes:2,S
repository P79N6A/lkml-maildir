I don't don't like it ;) Unfortunately too many people end up enabling
it and having issues with their keyboards. Can we have it depend on
DEBUG_KERNEL? And probably KEXEC as well?
Another option would be for it not use panic_blink. Do your kexec
kernels have atkbd support enabled? You could write an new "blink"
input handler that would latch to keyboards supporting leds and blink
by sending EV_LED events.
