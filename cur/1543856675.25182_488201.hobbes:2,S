Actually they represent the bits regarding the modes and it is used when we
have to send the LOCK/UNLOCK mode on the command data block, according to the MMC Spec.
If you take a look at mmc_lock_unlock function, we use those modes to set the right bit
when composing the command data block.
This definition makes the code more legible and simple.
