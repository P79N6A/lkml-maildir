I tried Eric Blade's patch
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=103477012517984&w=2>
but it didn't make any difference. Same keyboard error as before.
So either the patch doesn't change what actions are taken on reboot,
or the keyboard (std SERIO_I8042 + ATKBD PC stuff) driver was also
broken in the 2.5.41->2.5.42 step.
