   Right, the alignment stuff is a correctness issue, the consistent
   memory issue is a performance concern.  I like to think that 2.5
   will have a lot less correctness issues in the USB stack, so it
   can start to pay more attention to performance concerns.
I want to reemphasize that by going to consistent memory we solve
both problems, in particular the alignment stuff becomes a non-issue.
