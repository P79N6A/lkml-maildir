  I wonder why clear_user_highpage is necessary if we don't concern security.
When we write  to a anonymous page the very first time, we don't care
whatever the original contents of that page is. And
clear_user_highpage() takes a lot of cpu time under certain workload
such as compiling kernel.
 Is there any reason I don't know to reserve it?
