As far as forwarding to Linus, not sure about that yet - I suspect
these patches may cause akpm some reject grief since they're fairly
wide-spread over the kernel.  If akpm prefers the small patches
instead of one large one, it may make sense for it to go via akpm.
I don't have a preference myself - it's whatever's easiest for others.

Obviously, there's still more to come when I get a round tuit, but
this should provide sufficient infrastructure to allow folk to
move over the remaining areas if I don't get there first.  ISTR
SCSI requires a bit of work.
