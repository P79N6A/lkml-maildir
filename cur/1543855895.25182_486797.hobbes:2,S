I tried to do that for pxa, the patch is attached.
So what is the state of this discussion, now that 2.6.19 is here?
I just submitted an input driver for GPIO buttons to linux-input that
we use in the handhelds.org kernel for sa1100, pxa and s3c2410 archs.
It needs some ugly
#ifdefs currently, but with common GPIO calls they all could go away.
