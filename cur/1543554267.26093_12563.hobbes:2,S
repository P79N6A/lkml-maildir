It may be out of print by now, but the original reference for the x86 ABI, is
the:
	System V Application Binary Interface
	Intel386 (tm) Processor Supplement
When Cygnus purchased the manual I have, many moons ago, it was published by
AT&T, with a copyright date of 1991, published by Prentice Hall, with an ISBN
number of 0-13-877689-X.  It most recently was published by SCO (possibly even
Caldera, which just bought SCO).  You can get an online version from:
