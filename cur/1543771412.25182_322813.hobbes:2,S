ACPI hotplug code now uses the PCI core to allocate and manage
resources for hot-plug devices. To work correctly, this requires
all bridges to report resources they are decoding in their
pci_bus structure. We already do this for PCI-PCI bridges, but
not for host bridges. This patchset reads and stores host bridge
resources reported by ACPI BIOS for i386 and x86_64 systems.
This is the 2nd version of this patchset. The major change is
that it increases the number of resource pointers in the pci_bus
structure and eliminates the need to have a boot time parameter
to enable the code.
Andrew, if you add this to the next -mm, please also drop the
previous version this patchset (i386-collect-host-bridge-resources.patch
and x86_64-collect-host-bridge-resources.patch).
