Well, it looks reasonable, but at the very least the magic constant "25"
would need to be something readable like "HZ/2" so that it would actually
work on correctly other architectures than x86 too.
Also, I'm really rather nervous about 250ms being too long. Are there any
really good touch-typists out there? I can easily see somebody pressing
the same key more than four times a second, and I'd hate to lose
keystrokes for good typists. Please convince me this is safe..
