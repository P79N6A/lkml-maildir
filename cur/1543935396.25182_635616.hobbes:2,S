Am I to conclude then that there's no point in addressing the issues other
people pointed out? While I (obviously, since I submitted the patch disagree),
I'm not certain how others feel. My main point for disagreement here is (I'm
sorry to repeat this) that as long as certain code isn't allowed into the kernel
I think it is not unreasonable to at least expect the kernel to provide some
fundamental infrastructure that can be used for those (supposedly
unacceptable) bits. All I did here was utilizing the base infrastructure I want
added to clean up code that appeared pretty ad-hoc.
