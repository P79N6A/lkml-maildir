i'm not "an RT guy", -rt is just one of the many projects i've been 
involved with.
and no, i dont think stop machine is "evil" - it's currently the best 
way to do certain things. If you can solve it better then sure, i'm 
awaiting your patches - but the only patch i saw from you so far was the 
one that turned off stop-machine for isolated cpus - which was 
incredibly broken and ignored the problem altogether.
Right now the answer is: "if you want to do hard RT then avoid doing 
things like loading modules". (which you should avoid while doing 
hard-RT anyway)
