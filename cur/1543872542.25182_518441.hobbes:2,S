Look, you're absolutely right, I'm stretching the terms much too far.
namespaces implies some kind of domain, which is the namespace, and
entities within the domain, which are the names, and there is a (task,
domain) mapping. I was thinking that this implies all similar (task,
domain) mappings could be treated in the same way. But when you apply
this to something like cpusets, it gets a little abstract. Like the
entities are (task,cpu) pairs and the domains the set of cpus that a
process can run on.
