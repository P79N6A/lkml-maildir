Subject: [BUG] Race for nr_tasks in kernel/exit.c? (2.2.12)

My system's nr_tasks (as shown in /proc/loadavg) was growing with time,
while the number of processes (as seen in ps -aux) remained basically
constant.
In kernel/exit.c, it apears that nr_tasks decrement isn't protected by any
locks.  I moved all modifying of nr_tasks into <add|get>_free_taskslot()
in include/linux/sched.h.  Here it is protected by the taskslot_lock.  The
problem looks fixed.
This is the first real playing I've done in the kernel, so I'd really
apreciate some feedback from someone with more of a clue.
