Fixed.

While being as ugly as night, which is even noted in sources:
-       /* 'perfctr_pmdev' is here because the current (2.4.1) PM
-          callback system doesn't handle hierarchical dependencies */
Nothing prevents more clients from registering as subtrees to APIC. I
did not do that for NMI watchdog because it is hardcoded in Makefile,
anyway.

Fixed.

I'll fix APM to call device model methods.

Because PM_SUSPEND/PM_RESUME is ugly and can not be made to work
(devices are hierarchical, and PM_SUSPEND/PM_RESUME system does not
honour that).
