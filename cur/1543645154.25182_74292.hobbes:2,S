   I have... The implementation is bad. Source address must be retieved
   from route, not running this elephant function each packet.
   
This only runs at connect time, and when NULL fl->fl6_src is seen
by ip6_build_xmit() (this means RAW,UDP,ICMP which must make these
decisions anyways).
Is there really so much computation to be saved by moving this
to ipv6 route?
