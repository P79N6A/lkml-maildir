We can't reach out and revoke your license arbitrarily.  Even if we put
into the license that we could do that, it's not enforceable.  That's more
or less blackmail "gimme all your money or I'll revoke your license".
While the BK haters love to spread FUD about us having that ability
that's just nonsense, it would never stand up in any court.
So it's a moot point.  We aren't going to revoke your license, you get
to revoke your license by violating the terms.
As for the on disk format, sure, you can dig it out.  It's loosely
derived from the SCCS format, we used to be compatible with SCCS but we
dropped that because it was too restrictive.  But you could go get CSSC
and tweak it enough to get your data out.
If you are worried about this, the easiest way to make sure that you are
safe is park a clone of your tree on bkbits.net.  There is no license
required to get at the data over the web and all the data and metadata
is right there.  If you are worried that we'd drop bkbits.net you could
hire a neutral third party, get them to run their own BK server, park
your data there, and you have the same thing.
We don't do lockins.  Period.  You can get out of BK if that's what you
want to do.  This is a good time to note that we have a >99% renewal 
rate w/ our commercial customers.  But the ones that wanted to get
out, I think there have been 2 or 3, got all their data out and all 
their history out.
