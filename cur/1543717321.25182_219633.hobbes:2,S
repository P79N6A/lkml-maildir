We can see this happening in the following numbers taken using dcachebench*
gathered on 2-way P4 Xeon 2.4MHz SMP box with 4.5GB RAM. The benchmark was run
with the following parameters and averaged over 10 runs.
./dcachebench -p 32 -b testdir
		Average	microseconds/iterations 	Std. Deviation
		(lesser is better)
2.6.6		10204					161.5
2.6.6-mm1	10571					51.5
*dcachebench is a microbenchmark written by Bill Hartner and is available at
