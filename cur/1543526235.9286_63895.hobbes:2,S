Hi Linus,
  during reading through code I found that when code was converted from
old put_user to new in-kernel buffer, it started to try to store unaligned
shorts and it is fatal on some architectures, AFAIK. So there is patch.
For vcs_write, I added simple get_unaligned, as I did not found any
reasonable way to fix it except splitting loop for attributed and
non-attributed (vcsa & vcs) paths completely.
  For vcs_read, I rewrite inside loop so that now always character
+ attribute is copied into buffer - code is shorter, gets rid of
ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN and I believe that it is more readable. I also
changed logic for computing buffer sizes for HEADER_SIZE data,
original code had some problems with writting beyond buffer when
pos was in range 1..HEADER_SIZE-1.
  Patch was created on 2.3.46. 
					Thanks,
