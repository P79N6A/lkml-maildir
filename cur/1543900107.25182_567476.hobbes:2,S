That's all well and good, but for most non-trivial stuff, you
have to disable preemption as well which you cannot do in
userspace. Which I suspect is why there is not a great deal
that can use it in kernelspace either.
So it will remain to be seen what kind of per-cpu data structures
you can access in a highly scalable way, and how big the niche is
between real per-thread data structures and real locking. I'm
skeptical :)
