> Fix this sparse warnings by making the functions static:
Can you please fix the date on your computer, it should
have been Dec 14th or 15th when you posted this :-/
This is screwing up the ordering of patches on patchwork,
since it sorts them by date, and that's how I prioritize
my work as a result.
Thanks!
