Egads! No offense, but that sucks ... I have the same same drive (just
bought it last week):
hdparm -ItT /dev/hdb

 # Where can I tune, except for "hda=autotune,dma" (tried that)?
tried:
 hdparm -u1 -c1 -d1 -m8 -X66 /dev/hdb
?
But my question is, why isn't the current mode showed with "hdparm -i" or
"hdparm -I" ??
