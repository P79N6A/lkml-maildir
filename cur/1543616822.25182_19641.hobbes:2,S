Yes, I was unsure about the eepro100 driver, but didn't revert the patch
because it worked in my UP tests.
I usually test the network drivers in 100 Mbps switched network and with 10
Mbps overloaded hub with huge amounts of collisions. The 3c90x driver has
been badly behaving in very congested networks. It looks like it can spend
worst case 1 second in timeout loop.
I have soft realtime application which needs to have simultaneous
soundcard/disk/network/GUI access and that's the motivation for the patch.

I completely agree, the startup code is usually too timing critical. That's
why I left the initialization parts out of scope.
