Subject: [PATCH] sundance.c: high interrupt load [resent]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/2/10/87

In at least some versions of Kernel 2.6 (2.6.8.1, 2.6.11-rc2)
the driver drivers/net/sundance.c creates high interrupt load
(~ 100 interrupts per second) even in case of no network traffic
at all.
It seems that some sort of TX overflow handling is misplaced
and triggers interrupts very often even in case of no data to
send. The TX overflow handling has been moved to a more
appropriate place.
While there, an off by one error of reading the TX status has
also been corrected by moving the read after the break.
Thanks to Jeroen who tested the patch (also with high workload).
Interrupts are down to normal and there are no obvious side
effects.
The attached patch is against kernel 2.6.11-rc2. A copy has been
sent to Donald Becker but unfortunately no response arrived.
Comments are very much appreciated.
Best regards,
-andi
