Is is too bad even for RISC case, you never have enough registers, that's a
rule.
But you can protect against buffer overflows on the stack in other means:
1) by making stack not executable
2) by putting all the libraries and code (ie. all segments with executable
   permissions) by default to addresses which have at least one zero byte in
   it (big endian is helpful here).
   Not that this is nicely doable on 32bit architectures, but on 64bit
   it is a piece of cake
Cheers,
