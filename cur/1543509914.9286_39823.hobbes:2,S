Here is an attack of the above system.
 1. Open a few thousand files.
 2.	Save the the filehandles for each of these files.
 3.	delete all the the files created above.
 4.	Incriment the the generation number in each of the
	saved filehandle.
 5. Try to read files using the above filehandles.  If this
    does not give you ESTALE you have opened a file that
	someone else created.
Also 2^32 is not a very big number.  It would be nice to be able
to tell the difference between a stale filehandle and an attack.
