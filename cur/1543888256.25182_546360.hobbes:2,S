Try removing the one in front of the comma, it makes the count -1.  And I 
wrote, probably a good 20 years ago, a gizmo I called cntx that found that 
stuff for you.  I occasionally use it to run over a section of the kernel 
tree, but it rarely finds anything to fuss about.  And I really do need to 
make it handle shell expansions so you don't have write a quick script to 
have it scan everything in a directory.  However I suspect that most of you 
already have such a tool in your bag of tricks.
