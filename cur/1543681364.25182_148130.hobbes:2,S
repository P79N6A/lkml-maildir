More than that, I have been updating against rawhide and your stuff
since I started messing with your kernel rpms.  So, if you have it
uploaded to either of those and my system is using that functionality
(which modutils is obviously one of those), then I am running that
software.
I did get a version of 2.5.x to work, but I think that was back around
2.5.46 or something like that.  I had too many problems with Gnome back
then and so went back to 2.4.x.  Those have been fixed, so now I am
trying to help with testing.
