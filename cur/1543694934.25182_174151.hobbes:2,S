Oh well. *8}  It's that funny thing called the BIOS isn't it.  Doh!!
: USB Function for DOS
: Enable this item if you plan to use the USB ports on this mainboard in a DOS
: environment.
Well assuming it implies some kind of 16bit related access mode then I suppose

support for dos" in the manual.  What happens if you disable "USB Function 
Support" completely?
