Subject: display anomaly when switching between X and virtual terminals

linux-kernel et al:
I have a relatively simple question (I think).  Today I brought my Toshiba
Satellite to work, and in transit it took a few shakes.  When I brought it
home this evening, I noticed some strange behaviour.  I keep my email on
my internet gateway and ssh to it when I want to read it.  I prefer using
the true console and not the kterm, as it allows for better reading.  For
the first time tonight, I noticed that when switching between the
consoles and X, the white text momentarily turns an aqua green before the
display is redrawn.  This does not happen when switching between the 6
consoles, only when going back to X.  What I wanted to know is if this
behavious is a result of some sort of hardware damage or if it is a
problem with the kernel and/or X.  It's not that important, I was just
wondering if I should be worried.
Thanks in advance,
Michael Mohr
