According to the documentation the VT82C686 has the following devices on
the internal bus: bus 0 dev ? fn 0-6.  dev ? being the device of the
bridge itself. Re-reading the docs unlike the other the PCI idents aren't
fixed so my assumption of dev 0 is actually unsafe. I can't see anything
in the doc which guarantees 7 either.
