No, not since I sent you the packet trace from a 2.5 kernel that
wasn't working with "soft".  I took your advice and stopped using
"soft".  It causes the obvious problem when I (rarely) turn off the
server, otherwise it's been fine and I'm using 2.6.5 now, still fine
(with "soft" not being used).

If few-100-microsecond retransmits no longer occur, perhaps it's no
longer relevant.
The problem I saw with "soft" was that the retransmit time was quite a
good estimate of the server response time.  That part was fine, nice
even.  But then the server response latency would increase by a factor
of 10000 (ten thousand) due to normal disk I/O activity (compare cache
response with disk response on a busy disk), and of course 3
retransmits doubling each time is not adequate to cover that.  2.4 was
fine because the default rtt and retrans together could never get
shorter than a few seconds.
That's why I felt that iff rtt was adapting to the server response
time, then a fixed number of retransmits was no longer appropriate: a
lower bound on the time before timing out is appropriate, e.g. 3
seconds or 10 seconds or whatever.
In other words, with adaptive rtt the concept of "retrans" being a
fixed number is fundamentally flawed -- unless it's also accompanied
by a minimum timeout time.  You'd need a retrans value of 20 or so for
the above perfectly normal LAN situation, but then that's far too
large on other occasions with other networks or servers.
