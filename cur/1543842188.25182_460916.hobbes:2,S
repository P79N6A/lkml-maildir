==> Regarding [RFC 0/5] dio: clean up completion phase of direct_io_worker(); Zach Brown <zach.brown@oracle.com> adds:
zach.brown> There have been a lot of bugs recently due to the way
zach.brown> direct_io_worker() tries to decide how to finish direct IO
zach.brown> operations.  In the worst examples it has failed to call
zach.brown> aio_complete() at all (hang) or called it too many times

zach.brown> This set of patches cleans up the completion phase with the
zach.brown> goal of removing the complexity that lead to these bugs.  We
zach.brown> end up with one path that calculates the result of the

This all looks good, the code is much easier to follow.  What do you think
about making dio->result an unsigned quantity?  It should never be negative
now that there is an io_error field.
ACK.
