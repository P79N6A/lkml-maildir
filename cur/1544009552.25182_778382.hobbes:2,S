Delayed allocation will makes multiple block allocation possible for
buffered IO.  
However, we still need to check the percpu counter on write_begin() time
for every single possible block allocation (this is to make sure fs is
not overbooked), unless write_begin() could cluster the write requests
and maps multiple blocks in a single shot. So in reality in ext4 the
free blocks percpu_counter check and the s_dirty_blocks (percpu counter
too, for delayed blocks) only takes 1 block at a time:(
