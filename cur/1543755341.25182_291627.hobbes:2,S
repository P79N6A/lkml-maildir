1. Have you tried using external PS/2 mouse?
2. Have you plugged/unplugged into a port replicator?
2nd can be cured with psmouse.resetafter=3 (at least until we get
dock support in ACPI as pluggin/unplugging resets keyboard controller
and all devices without telling anyone), first one seems to be hopeless.
External device in Dells (at least in my Inspiron 8100) completely
shadows touchpad.
