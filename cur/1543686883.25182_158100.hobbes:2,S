I tried to explain that I can rely on SCSI position but kernel does not give 
me this SCSI position. Apparently we have some communication problem. You do 
not understand my question and I do not understand what you do not understand 
:) I attribute it to my bad English.
Let's avoid this communication problem. You show me namedev.config line that 
implements the above. If it really does it - it is likely I understand what 
you mean better and won't bother you with stupid questions anymore. If it 
does not do it - I can immediately point out where it fails.
OK?
thank you
