Well, to get tail -f to work, minimally you'll have to support
maintaining a fileposition, so tell() and seek() have something useful
to work on.  It's been a while since I looked at the source for tail,
pretty much for similar reasons (wanted to follow a /proc file).  Most
/proc files are considered (relatively) fixed-length files, who's
contents get updated.  tail -f expects to follow a file that is
growing in size.
I don't have sources in front of me, so hopefully someone else will
step-up and provide more detail than I have.
