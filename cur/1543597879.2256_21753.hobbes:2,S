prerequisities: 2.4.7-vanille
     Recently (i cant recall when), i realised, that
some _different_ applications (like mikmod or something)
 are losing tty. I start these apps like that:
mikmod <random stuff skipped> > /dev/ttyXX 2>/dev/ttyXX < /dev/ttyXX &
and after some period of time, they loses the
tty, but this is not a 100% probability.
 I think it is relevant only for 2.4.7 in my situation...
thanks in advance...
