You don't - that's architecture implementation detail which drivers
have _zero_ business knowing about.
As far as you're concerned, the virtual address is Cmnd->request_buffer.
Anyway, you're using the wrong interface - pci_map_single() takes
a virtual address.  No need to play around getting the offset and
struct page for pci_map_page() when pci_map_single() implements
what you require.
