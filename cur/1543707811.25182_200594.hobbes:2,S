Agreed, the DFS's truncate interface should be vmtruncate().
Your earlier patch has a call to invalidate_mmap_range() within
vmtruncate(), which passes "1" to the last arg, so as to get
rid of all mappings to the truncated portion of the file.
So either invalidate_mmap_range() needs to keep the fourth arg
or needs to be a wrapper for an underlying function that
vmtruncate() can call, or some such.
The latter may be what you intended to do.
						Thanx, Paul
