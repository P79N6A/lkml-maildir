Add my voice to those who don't think 4k stacks are a good idea as a 
default, they break some things and seem to leave other paths (as others 
have noted) on the edge. I'm not sure what you have in mind as a "better 
kernel" but I'd rather have a worse kernel and not have to check 4k 
stack as a possible problem before looking at other things if I get bad 
behaviour.
Reliability first, performance later. We've lived with the config for a 
while, pain there is better than pain at runtime.
