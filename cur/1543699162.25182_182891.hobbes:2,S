Since, I believe, version 006, udev has shipped with an init script
contributed by rml that will create device nodes for devices present
at system boot. You should be able to just make sure that that runs
during your boot sequence and be fine. (I just ran this script on
my system, and made sure it proper nodes for all my IDE drives and
the partitions contained thereon.)
