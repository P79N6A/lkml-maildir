The idea was to make completion events as light weight as possible -- they 
can be read from the queue without even entering kernel space.  Support for 
getting multiple completion events is also needed (sigtimed wait only pulls 
one signal at a time).  Nothing is stopping us from adding support to do 
an async sigtimedwait that provides a completion event when a signal arrives.
