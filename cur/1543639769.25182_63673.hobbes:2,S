Hi,
currently this is not possible. Packets are counted by the device
driver. An aliased interface is just another name for the interface,
but it uses the same hardware.
You can setup iptable rules to count traffic generated for the
IP addresses of you alias interfaces.
That's what I did. If someone has a better idea, please tell me.
FreeBSD can do traffic accounting for virtual network interfaces.
cheers,
Patrick
