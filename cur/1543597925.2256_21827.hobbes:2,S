It's a while since I looked, but I /thought/ entropy only came from
IDE (not for instance from SCSI, and certainly not when everything
is sitting in cache). I have a reasonably active mailserver (SCSI,
no k/b, no mouse, lots of RAM) which doesn't have enough entropy
to cope with SSL/TLS gracefully without relying on the network
traffic (i.e. behaves like it is ramdisk only).
