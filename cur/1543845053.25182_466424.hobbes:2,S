Hm, I can't repro this. I just rolled a new set of i386-pda patches 
against 2.6.18-mm1, and tried your .config, but it boots fine for me. I 
may have fixed a problem in the process of generating new patches, but 
nothing stands out. The oops you're getting is pretty bad; it doesn't 
seem like it should be .config-dependent or in any way intermittent (ie, 
everyone should be seeing this if anyone does).
Anyway, could you try again with the new i386-pda patches? I'll post 
them shortly.
Thanks,
J
