No. Once it is inside the system it can be routed to any daemon that
will listen.
Multiple NICs work well IF the routers involved can use traffic analysis
to determine destination and path discovery at the source. Otherwise
the daemon will reply to the address in the packet header.

For a generic type server, yes. Especially if the traffic ends up at
the same place.
In a segmented network where some hosts are closer/partitioned from the
other interfaces then multiple NICs can work properly. This is a carefully
crafted network structure though, and not one that just "happens".
One place this works is in clusters. Each host can get a different hop
count for the various routes to the same destination - then it will choose
the route that is shortest. This is a "traveling saleman" problem in that
what is shortest at one moment may not be shortest in the next (traffic
load changes the definition of "shortest").
It is a basic assumption that rotating the DNS IP list is one way to
"balance" the load across several NICs where each NIC has equal connectivity,
though not identical routing.
