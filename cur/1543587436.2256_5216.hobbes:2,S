Uh, where are we talking about.  The current time list insert is real
close to O(1) and never more than O(5).

Right, but compared to the current O(5) max, this is just too long.

I would hope to move expired timers to another list or just process
them.  In any case they should not be a problem here.
One of the posts that started all this mentioned a tick less system (on
a 360 I think) that used the current time list.  They had to scan
forward in time to find the next event and easy 10 ms was a new list to
look at.  Conclusion: The current list structure is NOT organized for
tick less time keeping.
