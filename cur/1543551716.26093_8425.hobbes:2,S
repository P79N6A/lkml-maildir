Because I don't know this part of the kernel well enough yet :-)
Maybe there are cuncurrency issues with modifying multiple PTEs
when the kernel thinks it's only modifying one.  There may be
hardware-mandated limitations on this too.  I'll have to check
_very_ closely with the VAX Architecture Reference Manual.

Couldn't we use vmalloc() for this?

Too busy right now :-(

The 'scarce resource' I'm thinking about here is not memory, it's
system PTEs.

Memory from 0xc0000000 to 0xffffffff is not usable in VAX, so
map-all-memory will give a maximum of just under 1GB.  I have
a feeling that there is an architectural limit of 1GB anyway
(21-bit page frame number + 9 bit PAGE_SHIFT = 30 bits = 1GB).

Dammit!  Must have been just before I subscribed...  I'll do
some archive archeology later.
Later,
