What do you mean with this?
I checked it (after I found the solution in providing "root=2101" as  
kernel-cmd-string) and it failed again.
I typed: "mount -t auto /dev/hde1 /mnt".
BTW I have an "/etc/fstab" with the entry
"/dev/hde1       /mnt    ext2    defaults 1 1"
Thanks again for your tip with "printk_all_partitions" ...
