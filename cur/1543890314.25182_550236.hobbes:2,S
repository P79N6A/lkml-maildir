So when I use my travelling power adapter which I plug into the 12V-DC
power in my car, and it delivers DC power to my notebook.....
My note book tells me that I am using AC power....
I really think "AC" as the opposite of "battery" is wrong and should
be stamped out everywhere, certainly not introduced here.
"external power" maybe?
  Check deferred until system is externally powered.
