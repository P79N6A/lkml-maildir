Hi Andrew,
Hi Nagar,
Thanks for your reply and for your time.
Few years ago the few additions I have explained, have been implemented in 
linux 2.4.18 kernel at  the Sydney Uni as part of a large research project.
Also few years ago I have posted many posts about this topic to this 
forum.  Few very experience hands  were advising me in coding at that time. 
To prove this I have all the e-mails with me. Yet then I had not explained 
to this forum about the research project which involved prediction 
algorithm as then it had not been published.
Thereafter few research papers have been published with regard to this. 1 
in US.
Currently I am preparing the changes to a more recent linux patch.
In fact my question in the post was about performance testing after the 
changes being done.
--2) Now about the tests
--As I have documented all this yet need to perform some standard tests for 
the sake of completion.
--What tests should I carry out to prove that the system is still intact?
--
--Please tell me whether the below is correct?
--(a) As suggested by the 
http://kernel-perf.sourceforge.net/
 the lmbench 
and re-aim-7 test packages can be used to test the ----performance of the 
kernel before making changes and after. (Not done as yet)
--(-b) Further tests have been carried out to check the response time of 
short tasks before making changes and after making --changes. The results 
indicated that there was no difference in the response time after 
introducing the changes to the kernel (done)
---(c) Thereafter the tests have been carried out to check the runtime of 
long tasks before and after making changes. The results of the tests 
revealed that there is no change in reported runtime in both occasions.(done)
Thanks
