Hello! 
Maybe you know something about this. There is a connection to one of my
machines that is still open, but I cannot find any process that is attached to
it. It is a FTP-connection some days ago:
wu-ftp-log:
Mon Jan 18 01:34:46 1999 7311 ics2F.D.srv.t-online.de 344064 /pub/(deleted)/install.exe b _ o a webmaster@speth15.ddo01.t-online.de ftp 0 *
This transfer was interrupted, as the file is about 10 times larger.
netstat -a:
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State
tcp        0  48824 smuf.wg.huwig.de:27445  ics2F.D.srv.t-onl:37680 ESTABLISHED
This is the only connection to 'ics2F', but no FTP-process is running.
There is nothing in the messages at this time. wu-ftp is started via inetd:
ftp     stream  tcp     nowait  root    /usr/sbin/tcpd  wu.ftpd -a
Kernel is 2.0.36 with SuSE 5.3 (libc5).
Any suggestions?
Kurt
