Thanks for taking interest and working on this.

How does per-gid help in this case (esp. the desktop scenario you
mentioned)?  And the /proc/tpe file might as well go under sysfs with
the rest of the other entries instead of cluttering /proc.

The two biggest issues are 1) it's trivial to bypass:
$ /lib/ld.so /untrusted/path/to/program
and 2) that there's no (visible/vocal) user base calling for the feature.
So working those issues will help make a better case for mainline
inclusion.
