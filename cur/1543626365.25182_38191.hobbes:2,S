I set the AGP aperture based upon the following
information:
"The AGP aperture is an area of system RAM reserved
for use by the AGP card for storing textures if it
needs to.  The RAM is available for use by the system
as normal if not used by the graphics card."
...
"It is generally advised to set the AGP aperture to
half the system RAM ."
Therefore, it seemed reasonable to maximise my AGP
aperture size for all and any conceivable textures (I
have system RAM to spare), with no harm done.
Admittedly, 256 MB does seem excessive, but anyway ...
;-).
