Whao did I start all that??
Apologies...but I can asked which way kernel development was going
(ALSA/OSS), and if ALSA was worth chasing.
Well I sorted that out, looks like ALSA wins...At least in my opinion.
Couple points I noted on reading the thread I started.
What the heck would multiple users on a single machine be all directing data
to a sound card at the same time for?  Sounds absolutely pointless to use
that example as a problem.  If I'm on a X-terminal of a Linux server, the
last thing I want to do is play an MP3 file that only the administrator
sitting next to his machine can hear!!!!  Why not use logic to determine the
most elegant resolution of design problems??  (Disclaimer:  Not that I know
anything much about it!!)
New sound cards hitting the market today seem to be getting more
feature-packed all the time.  Which would say to me that the API is going to
be huge.  The sound system must be extremely flexible, and have a wide-range
of abilities, which means complexity.  You can have one without the other
really.  Therefore if alsa is trying to enable to much in your opinion, then
they must have their plans correct in the first place.
Here's hoping the effort being put in today make Linux a multimedia platform
of preference in the future.
