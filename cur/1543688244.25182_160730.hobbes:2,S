i followed the workaround presented in
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=106191212815398&w=2
to get the ide cd to not oops my suspend.
now, i can watch it suspend the disks, listen to them spin down, and
then it just sits there, quietly, with the power led and screen on
(with display, not just backlight).
this is a dell inspiron, and i'm using the fn-suspend hotkey as works
nicely in 2.4.
thanks.
