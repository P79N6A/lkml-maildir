I don't agree about API, but that's how it goes :) APIs are too 
important to bring them down from my point of view.

Of course!

I know, I can bring ideas but I think most of them are already somewhere :)

That should be an option.

That can be partly true. There are many things which are gpl (so no 
licence problems) but are not in the kernel (see the pwc module).

I don't buy hardware not already tested with linux...

Mh. Good thing to know.

That's why I was thinking about high modularity. Increasing the 
modularity and of course, having the same api gives extreme flexibility 
in changing the internal representation.
You know what? I was amazed about the /dev directory. When in 96 I first 
approached linux, I simply said: that's a smart thing, handling every 
kind of device the same way. Writing in a console is not different from
writing in /dev/hda. Amazing.
I was just thinking about something like that for kernel developing. 
Having an external representation which is stabe like it's /dev, but 
flexible internally (I don't mean that the kernel shoud provide a 
``devfs'' for module!). When a new piece should be added, it doesn't 
matter the version, the way of accessing things are still the same. How 
it works may differ a lot.
I strongly believe in high modularity. No questions about micro/macro 
kernel. Both have pros and cons. But I strongly believe that a very 
small kernel providing means for modules to work (in kernel space) is 
something at least easier to mantain, other than having a single piece. 
Modules were very nice when I began to write some of them (it was kernel 
2.0.x though --- slack 3.0) just for fun. Just add a new piece and 
you'll be able to use a new device, and they can be provided by anyone. 
New file systems, new sound cards, everything, just adding a ``small'' 
piece of code --- it was painful using isapnp package and have my weird 
soundcard work! Ah, good memories... :)
