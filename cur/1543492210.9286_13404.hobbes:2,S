These are very different things, and are not interchangeable.

Wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong!
DO USE copy_to_user or put_user.  First, it plugs big oops leaks.
Second, nice systems like m68k or Sparc64 put userland in a 
completely different address space, so assignment won't even
pretend to begin to work.
