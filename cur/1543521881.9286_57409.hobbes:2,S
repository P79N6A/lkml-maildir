They went from 18 Feb 1753 to 1 Mar 1753 according to my large list of
changeovers. The attached note mentions the 1704 and 1708 leap year

My, you do have a long memory :-)
Um, this is seriously off-topic. ObKernel: the zone/compartments/MAC
I'm implementing for the kernel now copes with networking as well as
filesystems and tasks so you can have multiple "virtual machines"
running with different IP source addresses/routing in each. It should
be ready for some sort of alpha release soon.
