Subject: [PATCH] do_sigaction: don't worry about signal_pending()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

do_sigaction() returns -ERESTARTNOINTR if signal_pending(). The comment says:
	* If there might be a fatal signal pending on multiple
	* threads, make sure we take it before changing the action.
I think this is not needed. We should only worry about SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT case,
bit it implies a pending SIGKILL which can't be cleared by do_sigaction.
Kill this special case.
