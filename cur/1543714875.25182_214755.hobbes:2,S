Right... ...but since the timeout value is already capped at 60 seconds,
this is not a major problem. It is pretty pointless to be talking about
"predictable" or "consistent" behaviour when talking about a situation
where we believe that the server has crashed.
AFAICS, all we care about is to establish a predictable *lower limit*.
