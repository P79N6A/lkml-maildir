Probably the last before I join the cabal^Wothers in Ottawa,
so it flushes everything of importance I had pending, and
resyncs with Linus' latest and greatest.
I'll try and keep up with anything that turns up during the
following week (time & network connection permitting), but
with 99% of the regulars otherwise occupied at KS/OLS,
I imagine it'll be a quiet week.
As usual,..
