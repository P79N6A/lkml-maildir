Hi Christoph,
A patch of yours modified fs/ntfs/inode.c::ntfs_truncate() and inserted 
this comment:
[snip]
	/* normally ->truncate shouldn't update ctime or mtime,
	 * but ntfs did before so it got a copy & paste version
	 * of file_update_time.  one day someone should fix this
	 * for real.
	 */

Did you realise that all (local) file systems in Linux kernel set both 
{m,c}time in their ->truncate function.  E.g. from 
fs/ext3.c/inode.c::ext3_truncate():
inode->i_mtime = inode->i_ctime = CURRENT_TIME_SEC;
Would you be so kind to explain what is your problem with ntfs doing it, 
too?  And if your statement is correct and no file system should touch 
{m,c}time in their ->truncate() method, could you explain to me how the 
{m,c}time would be set otherwise when open(O_TRUNC) or {f,}truncate() is 
executed on a file?
Thanks a lot in advance.
Best regards,
	Anton
