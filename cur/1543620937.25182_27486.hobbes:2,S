Link state checking _would_ be nice, though, for stuff like laptops 
using dhcp.  Right now, if I start my laptop without being plugged into 
the network, I have to wait for DHCP to time out before it'll finish 
booting - about 1 minute.  (yech!)
Is there a good way for a dhcp daemon to find out whether the laptop is 
connected to the network or not?  It'd be really sweet if dhcpcd could:
- down the interface and remove routes whenever the network cable was 
unplugged
- wait for the interface to get link beat again, and send a new request
This would greatly enhance desktop usability.  I'd be happy to do the 
dhcpcd hacking if the right kernel interfaces were available.
regards,
	David
