Bill - so what happens if you trim down the aio, event and ksoftirqd
threads to a sane size (you might also want to do something about the
fact 2.5 still runs ksoftirq too easily). Intuitively I'd go for a
square root of the number of processors + 1 sort of function but what do
the benchmarks say ?
