I'm not sure it is worth it.  If you are using BK, run revtool and look at
the recent history in 2.5.  I just updated the CVS tree on kernel.bkbits.net
and looked carefully at the collapsing it did.  It collapsed a pile of Greg's
stuff into one cset, but that's actually OK as far as I can tell, it's all
related.  And there was more work on the other path.
We've done several updates to the 2.5 tree and so far the number of changesets
we would have gotten if we had done it all in one pass and the number that 
we actually got is identical.  So maybe the reality of the incremental updates
is better than we expected.
