That sounds to me like the perfect job for grep. In fact, it is _very_
similar to the job the GNU guys did on the early days of i18n. They
had the tool that extracted all the strings in _("xlate me") 
[#define _(a) a ] and built a catalog.
If you guys are up to it, I volunteer to write/port such a tool to scan 
out the send_kevent{_atomic,}()s and make a catalog out of it.
