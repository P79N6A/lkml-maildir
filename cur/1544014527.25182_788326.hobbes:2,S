hm, i never saw this warning and i run tons of different kernels (on 
different hw with different build environments) so if this was a more 
generic BKL init problem i'd expect to have seen it one way or another.
But i think the bug that Alexey is seeing is genuine:

i dont think it's a BKL problem - i think something in linux-next which 
went upstream recently leaked a preempt count.
What is weird is that we have detection for softirq preemption leaks:
                        if (unlikely(prev_count != preempt_count())) {
                                printk(KERN_ERR "huh, entered softirq %td %p"
                                       "with preempt_count %08x,"
                                       " exited with %08x?\n", h - softirq_vec,
                                       h->action, prev_count, preempt_count());
                                preempt_count() = prev_count;
And this did not appear to have triggered for Alexey. So this probably 
cannot be a softirq handler leak, nor an initcall handler leak.
The only possibility seems to be for this to be a preempt leak in hardirq 
handler - i.e. locking inbalance by some driver. It did not get detected 
there (because the preempt count was kept elevated by the BKL and by the 
softirq handler), but when the softirq got released. The stack has some 
hardirq signs, but no specific blame for which driver might be 
responsible.
This would be a candidate for bisection i suspect, barring any better, 
more specific ideas (like a specific timeframe for when this hit upstream, 
or a better stacktrace of the hardirq context that triggered this softirq 
instance).
