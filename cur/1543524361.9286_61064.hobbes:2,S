Hello,
this is realy wired. I've got a Usermode Program which doesn't work anymore
when using Kernel Version 2.2.14!
It works perfect when rebooting into 2.2.12
When running 2.2.14 it just tells the following:
execl transmitter: Bad address
I'm talking about the batcher Program of the sendmail bsmtp package batcher
program BTW.
TIA for your Help
Sven
