I noticed that my 3-disk RAID was syncing at about 40MB/s, now that I
added a fourth disk it goes at only 20+MB/s. This is on an idle machine.
Individually, each disk measures 60+MB/s with hdparm.
kernel: 2.6.13 on ia32
Controller: Promise SATAII150 TX4
Disks: WD 320GB SATA
Q: Is this the way the raid code works? The way the disk-io is managed? Or
could it be due to the SATA controller?
