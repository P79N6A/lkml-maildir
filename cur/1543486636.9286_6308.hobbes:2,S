I run debian, and whenever I shutdown, the system does not turn off.  The
last message on the screen is "Power off", and then the system just sits
there (as with a normal halt).  I have a Tyan tiger100 m/b, SMP, and  I know
it supports power-off ;)  ( and I have the power-off option enabled in the
kernel ... )
Any ideas?  I know that some apm stuff isn't good to use with SMP .. could
that be the reason ?
