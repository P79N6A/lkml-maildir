That is precisely the problem.  What happens if you need to get to the

I mean the driver, not the hardware.  By the I2C driver being 
synchronous, I mean that you call a function, the whole operation occurs 
in the function, and then the function returns the result.  By 
asynchronous, I mean that you tell the driver to start an operation and 
the driver starts it and immediately returns.  It then uses interrupts, 
timers, or polling calls to drive the operation of the interface.  When 
the operation is done, the results are reported back through a callback 
function provided when the driver started.
Plus there are SMB alerts which the hardware can generate 
asynchronously.  The I2C driver has no concept of that right now.

There are two parts here.  There is the I2C driver and the IPMI driver 
that sits on top of it.  I'm really only taking about the I2C driver 
here, I need asynchronous operation from the I2C driver to do those 
things in the IPMI driver.

Yes, that is a better term.  I'll switch to using that.
