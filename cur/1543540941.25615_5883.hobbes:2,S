Folks,
I've come across a problem I can't solve in test6-pre5. In test4, my 3c509 
10bT ethernet card works fine. With test-6, (& test5, I think) I always get 
tx collisions, and the hub's link light is always off. ifconfig says the 
card is up and there are no error messages I can see in messages, etc, 
other than (something like) 'net.ipv4.ip_always_fragment: unknown symbol'.
Has anyone got any idea what's wrong?
Thanks,
Ruth
