Subject: Unexpected reboots on high IDE access

We have a number of Nova Eden 733 motherboards with the
VIA VT82C686 chipsets.
They will all reboot (not hang, actually reboot) after a random period 
of several hours. This seems to be linked with running an application 
with a lot of disk access.
The kernel is 2.4.27-pre1. Does anyone know of any problems that might 
cause this?
Thanks.
