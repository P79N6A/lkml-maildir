Subject: 2.6.14-RC2 Bug?  HiSpeed USB devices demoted to low-speed after resume

For both suspend-to-disk ("software suspend") and suspend-to-ram,
the 2.6.14-RC2 kernel appears to disable ehci_hcd on resume.
That is, plugging in a hi-speed Mass Storage device *after* resume
results in these syslog messages:
 >kernel: usb 3-1: new full speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 2
 >kernel: usb 3-1: not running at top speed; connect to a high speed hub
Very odd.  The 2.6.13 kernel behaves much better, as does 2.6.14-RC2
*before* suspending:
 >kernel: usb 5-5: new high speed USB device using ehci_hcd and address 3
Unloading and reloading ehci_hcd restores high-speed USB operation,
until the next suspend/resume.
WTF?
