Hello,
I have a device driver which can be configurated in kernel 2.4 to be a 
loadable module. But, in kernel 2.6, I made it as tristate in Kconfig. 
On make menuconfig list, I can only select it to [*]NewModule for kernel 
built-in, I cannot select it to [M]NewModule for loadable module 
(neither did I press key M or Space key produce [M]). Is it wrong to 
specify tristate in Kconfig to make a loadable module in kernel 2.6? Or 
what was I missing in kernel 2.6 config?
Thank you.
Jim
