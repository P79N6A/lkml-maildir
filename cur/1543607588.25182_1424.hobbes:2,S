Seems that I have also good to talk to mayself....
lib/string.c tells truth.
strsep() returns NULL when *stringp is NULL.
if delim is not found *stringp is set to NULL (and original
*stringp value is returned).
Because kernel code claims that 
 * It returns empty tokens, too, behaving exactly like the libc function
 * of that name. In fact, it was stolen from glibc2 and de-fancy-fied.
 * Same semantics, slimmer shape. ;)
quoted manual page IS incorrect (at least if it describes glibc2 function.)
