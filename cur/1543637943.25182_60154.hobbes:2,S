What is /proc/libredhat supposed to be?  It hasn't ever been part of the
AIO patches.

Please don't.  First Ben has indicated on kernel summit that the abi might
change and I think it's a bad idea to lock him into the old ABI just because
suse doesn't want to have something called libredhat.so* in /lib.
Alternate suggestion: rename it to libunited.so.
And even if there is a syscall reservation the way to do it is not to add
the real syscall names to entry.S and implement stubs but to use
sys_ni_syscall.

Okay.  So you think the API is stupid but want it to get in without
discussion??
If you really want to ship the old-style AIO (of which I remember ben
saying it it broken for everything post-2.4.9) please stick to the patch
Ben has around, otherwise wait for the proper 2.5 solution.  I have my
doubts that it is backportable, though.
