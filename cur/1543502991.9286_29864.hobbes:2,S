The Amiga rumour mill is literally burning alive with the word
"Transmeta". Jim Collas (head honcho at Amiga Inc.) even hinted at it
when someone suggested it on a newsgroup.
I would ask the great Penguin if he knew anything about it, but he
seems to be doing as good a job as everyone else at Transmeta on the
keeping lips firmly clamped project, so it would be a waste of time ;)
