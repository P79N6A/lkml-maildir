I'm still getting a flood of the following errors when using gcc 2.95:

The following patch (as 268-rc2-mm1-link-errors.patch already in -mm) 
fixes this issue:
<--  snip  -->
From: Dave Hansen <haveblue@us.ibm.com>
Investigation of why the build is failing due to bogus detection of
undefined symbols: We're getting this warning:
arch/i386/kernel/irq.c
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:3565: Warning: setting incorrect section type for
.bss.page_aligned
Which comes from this code in the 4k stacks code:
static char softirq_stack[NR_CPUS * THREAD_SIZE]  __attribute__((__aligned__(THREAD_SIZE), __section__(".bss.page_aligned")));
static char hardirq_stack[NR_CPUS * THREAD_SIZE]  __attribute__((__aligned__(THREAD_SIZE), __section__(".bss.page_aligned")));
Removing the __section__() fixes it, as does moving to gcc 3.2 or 3.3,
but gcc 2.95 and 3.0 still exhibit the problem.  It seems the 4k stack
developers like newer compilers than I do :) 
The gcc 2.95 section declaration looks like this:
	.section        .bss.page_aligned,"aw",@progbits
while the 3.1 section looks like this:
	.section        .bss.page_aligned,"aw",@nobits
It's definitely a bug that's been fixed:
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/binutils/2002-10/msg00507.html
I've been told that I can fix it with a carefully crafted assembly file and
maybe a change to the linker script, but all that it buys us is a little
space in the uncompressed kernel image.  Plus, the warning will still be
there at compile-time.  
I say, put them back in plain old BSS.  Patch attached.
