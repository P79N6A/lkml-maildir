Can you point me to these reports?
I tested with a couple chipsets here and didn't find any problems.
Maybe we can compare the code in X with the code in the kernel
for the amount of data to save.
However we don't know if the X font code is completely without
problems. I remeber fixing a problem in X years ago - a case
where the kernel got it right ;-)
X VGA font code involves a lot of magic. Also things might differ
slightly form HW vendor to vendor and it will be extremely hard
to get it right for all chipset models therefore I would not even 
talk about 'bugs' ;-)

We could check for the kernel version. This could be done during build
time - assuming we don't ship generic binaries or during run time if we
want to provide binaries that work everywhere.
In reality the former would be sufficient for a lot of cases - especially
for vendor supplied binaries.
Once X.Org starts shipping binaries it should definitely provide a version
that fits everywhere.
But maybe you have a better suggestion.
Anyway, would my patch be acceptable for the kernel?
Cheers,
	Egbert.
