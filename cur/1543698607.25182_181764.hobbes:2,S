Which is why this hot remove project is side-stepping all
those hard problems, and just dealling with the "easy" cases
of only allocating user memory to removeable physical memory.
This is useful for large systems made up of removeable nodes
(either to physically remove a node, or to logically re-assign
a node to a different "partition" in the machine).
Anyone who wants more than this is welcome to virtualize the
base kernel, filesystems, driver code etc. to allow hot remove
of the remainder of memory not dealt with by this patch :-)
