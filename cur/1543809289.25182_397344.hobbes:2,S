Not harmless. The other patches seem to assume that the first one was 
_not_ done. IOW, patch #2 contains:
	-
	-#define        HOST_DISABLE \
	-               HostP->Flags &= ~RUN_STATE; \
	-               HostP->Flags |= RC_STUFFED; \
	-               RIOHostReset( HostP->Type, (struct DpRam *)HostP->CardP, HostP->Slot );\
	-               continue
	-
	-                       HOST_DISABLE;
and will thus obviously not apply at all if patch #1 was applied.
It looks like the indent was done _after_ patch #1 was applied, but then 
the result was diffed against the state _before_ patch #1 was applied.
So I'll flush the series, hoping for a corrected one that actually applies 
in order..
