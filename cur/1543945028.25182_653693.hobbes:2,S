There are any number of things you can do when the system is booted, but 
the only thing you can do when the system won't boot is use kernel boot 
options.
This is primarily useful for old systems running modern software, such 
as old PC redeployed to network, external device control, or system 
monitoring. Upgrading the BIOS is no longer going to happen, and 
upgrading the hardware isn't cost effective, but keeping old systems out 
of the landfill is ecologically and financially sound.
The option is a holdover from the past, but so arm some of my clients 
and their hardware. ;-)
And *my* hardware, I might add, I am as cheap as anyone.
