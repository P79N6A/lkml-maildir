Also related is "how can userspace be notified of kernel events?". 
There is no way for a userspace app to be notified that, for instance, 
an ATM device got a loss of signal.  The drivers print it out, but the 
userspace app has no clue.
I think that there should be a relatively generic way for drivers to 
distribute events such as this and for userspace to register interest in 
them.
Maybe netlink is the way to go, but its not exactly a simple interface.
