I plan to tidy it up for inclusion and put everything together to get
it work properly.
The code which is in the kernel is around 5 % done, the code which is
available on mcentral.de is around 50% done. It still requires some
work to get _all_ devices supported, and keeping the development
process in an endless loop and depending on people who have no idea
and don't care about certain requirements is no option.
The upcoming devices which use other chips and which have more
features will at least also use those drivers. I expect that it will
pump up the driver to support more than 100 devices within the next
year.
