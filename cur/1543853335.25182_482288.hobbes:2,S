Never underestimate yourself, Martin ;)

Yes, I agree, those particular changes looked just fine,
and indeed they're not to blame.

Yes, those all looked like no-ops.  The guilty party is ext2_new_blocks:
i386, x86_64 and ppc64 are now happily building on ext2s with this patch
below (I've been lazy, could have deleted your "E2FSBLK" addition too).
But I haven't attempted to correlate it with the loops seen (with OOMs
too on the x86_64, no idea why, but they've likewise melted away with
this patch).  And I'm dubious whether it's the _right_ fix: the whole
mess of ints, unsigned longs and __u32s looks tricky to me, not some-
thing to sort out in a hurry - I'm only working with small filesystems
here (looped on a tmpfs file).  (And if ret_block really should be an
ext2_fsblk_t there, shouldn't ext2_new_blocks return an ext2_fsblk_t
rather than an int?)
I see Andrew's sent me an alternative patch to try, I'll give that
a whirl now; and see if just making ext2_new_blocks return an
ext2_fsblk_t would do it too.
