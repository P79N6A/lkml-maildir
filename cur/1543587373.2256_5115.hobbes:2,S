2.4.3-pre6 quietly made a very significant change there:
it used to say "if (!order) goto try_again;" and now just
says "goto try_again;".  Which seems very sensible since
__GFP_WAIT is set, but I do wonder if it was a safe change.
We have mechanisms for freeing pages (order 0), but whether
any higher orders come out of that is a matter of chance.
(But of course, this may not be related to your problem,
and your "N-order allocation failed" messages must have
been from other instances than stuck in this loop.)
