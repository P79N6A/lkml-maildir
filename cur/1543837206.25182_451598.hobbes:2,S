Your patch seems to work as expected if I add a return 0 at the end of
modpost.c:secref_whitelist(). I like how you printed out the number of
modules being processed. I have one minor comment about your patch:
Modpost seems to get run twice on vmlinux if the kernel is built with
"make all". I think it would be best to run modpost on vmlinux only when
vmlinux is built - never when modules are processed.
Thanks,
