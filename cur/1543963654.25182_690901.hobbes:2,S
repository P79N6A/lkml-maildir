﻿Ok, I've created a new struct ﻿regulator_state in machine.h to describe
a regulators suspended state for a given system suspend state :-
struct regulator_state {
        int uV; /* suspend voltage */
        unsigned int mode; /* suspend regulator operating mode */
        int enabled; /* is regulator enabled in this suspend state */
};
'uV' and 'mode' are optional 'enabled' is mandatory. This should also
cover other PMICs where voltage and operating mode may be configurable.
I've also added the following fields to struct regulation_constraints in
machine.h :-
/* regulator suspend states for global PMIC STANDBY/HIBERNATE */
struct regulator_state state_disk;
struct regulator_state state_mem;
struct regulator_state state_standby;
suspend_state_t initial_state; /* suspend state to set at init */
This should define all the regulator's supported system suspend states
and be registered with the other constraints.
In order to switch PMIC suspend configurations, I've added :-
int regulator_suspend_prepare(suspend_state_t state);
This will configure each PMIC regulator (if required) with the correct
suspend setup prior to entering the new suspend state (and could be
called by machine suspend code to prepare the pc506xx).
