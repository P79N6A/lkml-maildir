OK, thank you for elaborating.
I suppose that I am more <choose one> {cynical, sarcastic,
practial, pragmatic}.  I don't have a crystal ball for 2 years
out and I don't know anyone who does.
IMO we do the best that we can given some human constraints
and probably some marketplace constraints (like ship something
instead of playing with it for 5 years before shipping it).

Yes, I was recently part of that argument in Ottawa.

Multiplexors have already lost AFAIK.  Unless someone changes their
mind.  Which happens and will continue to happen.

Yep.  Some people like that one.  Not everyone.

Ack.

sysfs requires one value per file.  Little parsing required.
But I don't know how to capture atomic values from N files with sysfs.

Hm, I don't recall that one.

I sympathize with you on that one.  I don't care for netlink much
either.  To me it's still an ioctl, even though it is routable
and extensible.

That's all part of the open-source development process.  Sorry
you dislike it.

I only know 2 people who could make it stick.

I agree.  We went thru some of this at the kernel summit.
The ioctls dissent topic didn't really have many dissenters.
(That was a surprise to me.)
Anyway, thanks again for the additional details.
