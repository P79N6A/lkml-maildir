So long as the user has some reasonable right to change the affected
tasks memory layout, and so long as they are moving memory within the
cpuset constraints (if any) of the affected task, or as close to that
as practical (such as with ECC soft error avoidance), then yes, it would
seem that this sys_migrate_pages() lets existing pages be moved without
changing the cpuset policy for the future.
