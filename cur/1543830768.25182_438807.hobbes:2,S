Yes.  It's an important property of Linux that it
provides a common, portable API for all arch's,
except where the obvious semantics (not performance)
of a call are necessarily arch-specific.
Just coding up system calls for those arch's that
happen to run a particular call super-fast, even
though the call makes logical sense on all arch's,
would lead to API chaos and impede application
portability.
