It seems useful for rcutorture to use or not use the preempting thread
independently of CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU_BOOST.  That would bring you from two
cases to four, and the two new cases both make sense:
* CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU_BOOST=n, but run rcutorture with the preempting thread.
  This configuration allows you to demonstrate the need for
  CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU_BOOST, by showing what happens when you need it and don't
  have it.
* CONFIG_PREEMPT_RCU_BOOST=y, but run rcutorture without the preempting
  thread.  This configuration allows you to test with rcutorture while running
  a *real* real-time workload rather than the simple preempting thread, or
  just test basic RCU functionality.
A simple boolean module_param would work here.
At some point, we may want to add the ability to run multiple preempting
threads, but that doesn't need to happen for this patch.

I didn't actually know that you could kill a kthread from userspace. :)
That rationale makes sense.

OK.

Even better, yes.

Fair enough; don't worry about it for this patch, then.  I'll deal with that
particular style cleanup later, throughout rcutorture.

Heh.  I have that problem as well; I always hestitate to trust the compiler to
initialize values.

Thanks.

As before, don't worry about it for this patch then.

Thanks!
