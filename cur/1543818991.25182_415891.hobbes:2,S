Precedence: bulk

This series of patches add support to have different
hugepage sizes for different tasks on IA64.
While still keep the kernel compatible to old applications.
With this patch, application can set it's huge page size via
a prctl syscall. 
Then different hugepage sized applications can co-work together.
