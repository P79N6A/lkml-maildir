The problem is in modules.conf
Most users do not use "depfile" and "path" commands
So they have not seen this problem.
Other have not read the man.
As I have tested the new 2.4 kernel, and I wanted to be able
to load and run modules, I have a big modules.conf using
theese commands.
The man for modules.conf says:
DEFAULT CONFIGURATION
         depfile=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.dep
         pcimapfile=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.pcimap
         isapnpmapfile=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.isapnpmap
         usbmapfile=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/modules.usbmap
         path[boot]=/lib/modules/boot
         path[toplevel]=/lib/modules/`uname -r`
         path[toplevel]=/lib/modules/`kernelversion`
         path[toplevel]=/lib/modules/default
This was true for modutils-2.3.19, and older versions.
With modutils-2.3.20 the syntax have changed.
Anything in ChangeLog?
`uname -r` has to be changed in $(uname -r)
