Before I modified eighty_ninty_three(), it returning 0 caused the _indicated_ 
mode to drop to UDMA33.  Check in /proc/ide/piix to see what mode the driver 
tells you.  IIRC (could be wrong), dmesg and hdparm both believe it to be in 
UDMA33 while the init code and /proc/ide/piix both showed it as UDMA5.
I'm starting to wonder if my ICH5 _is_ actually running UDMA5...  It's doing 
21MB/s, which I've been blaming on the old 30G Quantum, whereas the ICH4 with 
a 120G drive is doing 56MB/s...  I think I checked the bit flags in 
/proc/ide/ide0/config and it showed up as UDMA5.

I could put it there, but I was actually intending to use it to also return a 
value properly for eighty_ninty_three(), and figured that it would need to be 
a separate routine - I expect that the module structure needs to change, and 
that's where I'm not sure - it could affect _all_ ide drivers.  There might 
be others that have their own specific detection code, and what I'm looking 
to do is establish the framework for that.
Yes, there was a fairly stupid stuff-up on my part in my previous message - my 
business .sig wasn't supposed to get tacked on after my usenet .sig...  It 
_was_ a spam-free email address.  :-(
