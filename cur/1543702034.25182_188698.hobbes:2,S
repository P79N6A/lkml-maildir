I tried that, but at first, the driver spat out thousands of lines
of errors before the kernel failed to mount the root filesystem, and
then upon reboot, I still got various errors related to SCSI. When
I looked in the description of the aic7xxx drivers, I only found the
294x covered by the old driver.
I'll try again, I guess...
