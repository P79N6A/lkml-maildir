What about only reclaimimn cache if the cache has grown beyond a watermark
and only reclaimimn non-cache if it's below another watermark? I can imagine
it will solve my diskcache-pushes-out-mousehandler problem, and I'm pretty
sure having very low file cache is bad for performance, too.
Another thing I can imagine is to detect thrashing conditions and to
change scheduling in order to increase the likehood of cache hits and
thereby progress: If an application just got a page, keep it running for
a while (accumulating negative credits).
