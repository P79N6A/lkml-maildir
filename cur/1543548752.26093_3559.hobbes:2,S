(To several people)
Yes, I will.  Until later this evening I need my laptop for work.  This evening
I'll grab the serial cable and start making kernels and modules.
AFAIK, this is a kernel issue, going backwards to a kernel that doesn't switch
back to the first tty on resume, X remains in control of the screen and is quite
happy.  The first kernel that resumes and jumps back to the first tty, X crashes.
Doing a gdb on it yields a writev() that results in a segfault.  I'll do these two
problems individually.

Certainly.  I amonst others reported the key/mouse issue many kernels back and it
was a guess game for a while then Linus said the yenta was a red herring.  I don't
have that email anymore but there's a lot of detail to the key/mouse/pcmcia story
and I'll dig it all up and write it out again.
Basically I believe the kernel pcmcia code is off by one in the socket numbering
as dhinds socket numbering works and w/ the kernel, one socket hangs the machine
and the other socket appears to be numbered as #0 where w/ dhinds it was #1.  It
seems to wedge something physically because my laptop will forever hang at maestro
init after trying to use the top socket w/ the kernel pcmcia.  I have to remove
all power then it will boot up past the maestro init.  Note, the machine isn't
hard hung at maestro, the magic key works.  It just won't proceed through the
boot.
More to come this evening.
