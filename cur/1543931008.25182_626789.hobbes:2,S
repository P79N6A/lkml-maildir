Well, yes. Don't know what that effect is. A bus-clock divided from the CPU 
clock comes to mind, but I believe that shouldn't happen to LPC.
Anyways, we're looking for an upper bound and that's still nicely below 2 us 
on everything upto now, so I guess it doesn't matter all that much. Thanks!
Rene.
