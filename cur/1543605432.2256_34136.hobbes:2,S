Well, it is mostly up-to-date in -ac, but I think the Sistina folks have
given up on submitting it to Linus.  I do a bit now and then, but haven't
made much of a real effort to get it fully up-to-date.  Maybe now that the
whole block-device changes have settled down again I will submit a few
patches.
Cheers, Andreas
