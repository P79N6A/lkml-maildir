kick_object() doesn't return an indicator of success, which might be
helpful for determining whether an object was successfully removed. The
later-added kick_dentry_object(), for instance, can't remove dentries
where reference counts are still held.
I suppose one could check to see if the ->inuse counter decreased, too.
In either event, it would probably be helpful to abort the operation if
there was a reclamation failure for an object within the slab.
This is a relatively minor optimization concern. I think this patch
series is great and a significant foray into the problem of slab
reclaim vs. fragmentation.
