Not really.  AFAIK, 0xf0000000 is part of the PCI MMIO address space,
but on the machines that I have access to, this particular address
isn't assigned to any device:

OK, I'll try to find some time to trace the I/O MMU calls to see if
something isn't kosher at that level.  Is there a good way of getting
a relatively high-level of tracing in the USB subsystem that would
some me what's going on between the HID and the core USB level?
