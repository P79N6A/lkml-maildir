And here I thought it was the reset line on the bus... :-)
There are lots of ways to do that without involving the keyboard. The old way
was just to wire the serial break signal from the UART to the reset line...
Would that suddenly make the serial interfaces system devices?
What about that "wake on lan" business... does that make the network card a
"system  device"?
The only things I think of as "system device" is the CPU, the memory bus, and
sometimes a thing called a system controller/bus arbiter. The memory bus 
should provide access to any ROM needed for initial program storage.
Outside of that, everything is a peripheral, and should be treated as such,
even though the memory management unit is considered part of the CPU.
