Setting sc->swappiness to zero will make the reclaimer hit 
unmapped pages until we get into problems. Maybe set that to some negative 
value to avoid reclaim_mapped being set to 1 in shrink_active_list?
Oh. But reclaim_mapped is staying at zero anyways if may_swap is off. So 
we are already fine.
I still wonder why you are doing this at all. If you just run your own app 
on the box then preallocate your higher order allocations from user space. 
Much less trouble.
