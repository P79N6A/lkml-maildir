I agree.  If we use any optimization that requires alignment of the
buffer for aligned access, it needs to be clearly specified and
(ideally) enforced.
I've tried to make a patch, but it seems to be a bigger effort than I
expected.  It turns out that hermes_clear_words() is not doing what it
should (although it would only affect some buggy firmwares), and it's
clear that I just cannot replace a couple of arguments and hope for the
best.  I need to dust off my 802.11b cards and re-test everything.
I've started orinoco branch locally, and I hope I'll be able to clean
the driver from all that bitrot soon.
