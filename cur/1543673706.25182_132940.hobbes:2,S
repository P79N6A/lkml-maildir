In reality its harmless, only noisy, ide driver tryied to do something
like checking max native address and drive doesn't support it.

Which reminds me that somebody (me?) should fix hdparm to not use
WIN_IDENTIFY with HDIO_DRIVE_CMD ioctl but use HDIO_GET_IDENTIFY ioctl.
This command will be aborted by ATAPI device and hdparm don't know
if device is ATA or ATAPI, it currently only works because ioctl handler
reads data from device *before* checking status (or something like that).
Back on topic: Jens, you can also check current status of per driver
->abort() introduced by Alan.
btw. I will be quite busy for next 3 weeks (exams), so expect long
     delays in replies and slower ide progress.
