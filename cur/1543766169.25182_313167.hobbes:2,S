Subject: [PATCH 2.6.11] Documentation [corrected]: remove redundant info from SubmittingPatches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Since the Trivial Patch Monkey is mentioned both in steps 4. and 5., I
removed it from step4 (Select e-mail destination), since it should go
under 'Select your CC list'.

-For small patches you may want to CC the Trivial Patch Monkey
-trivial@rustcorp.com.au set up by Rusty Russell; which collects "trivial"
-patches. Trivial patches must qualify for one of the following rules:
- Spelling fixes in documentation
- Spelling fixes which could break grep(1).
- Warning fixes (cluttering with useless warnings is bad)
- Compilation fixes (only if they are actually correct)
- Runtime fixes (only if they actually fix things)
- Removing use of deprecated functions/macros (eg. check_region).
- Contact detail and documentation fixes
- Non-portable code replaced by portable code (even in arch-specific,
- since people copy, as long as it's trivial)
- Any fix by the author/maintainer of the file. (ie. patch monkey
- in re-transmission mode)
