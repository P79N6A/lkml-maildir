Subject: panic(): code wrong?

panic() contains the following if statement:
>         printk(KERN_EMERG "Kernel panic: %s\n",buf);
>         if (current == init_tasks[0])
			  ^^^^^^^^^^^^
>                 printk(KERN_EMERG "In swapper task - not syncing\n");
>         else 
I think this is wrong, it AFAICS it should be:
>	if(current == init_tasks[hard_smp_processor_id()])
>		printk(KERN_EMERG "In idle task - not syncing\n");
Additionally, smp_call_function() is broken, could I disallow calling
the function with disabled local interrupts?
If 2 cpu's disable the local interrupts, send an IPI message and poll
until the second cpu has received the interrupt, then we have a
dead-lock.
Currently mtrr[easy to fix], machine_restart() and panic() call
smp_call_function() with disabled interrupts.
I could hide the problem within smp_call_function(), but the result
would be extremely ugly.
Any better ideas?
