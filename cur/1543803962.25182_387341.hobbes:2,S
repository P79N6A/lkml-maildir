Yes, but that wasn't the case here. I've witnessed that a while ago, but 
this time, no. Just a read error, no device death nor going off-line. 
Otherwise I wouldn't be that much surprised that Linux didn't even try. 
The controller didn't do anything that would prevent system from reading. 
Windows used that and worked, Linux unfortunatelly didn't even try. That's 
why I'm talking about it here.
