2.6.0 isn't going to happen for at least a year or two.  What's the problem ?
Want 2.5.X ?  Get the tools too.
I'm in no position to push people around, but I think the whining about CML2
tool requirements is completely unjustified.  If we required that everything
worked with GCC 2.7.2 and nmake, where would we be today ?   I'm a lot more
worried about CML2 itself than about the tools it requires   :)

python2 will be in rawhide when 2.5 development requires it, if I'm not much
mistaken.
Whether CML2 requires python2 or not, the distributions will change. This is
not about Eric pushing something down people's throats. Tools evolve, and new
revisions introduce incompatibilities, but distributions still follow the
evolution.  Nobody ships perl4 today either.
