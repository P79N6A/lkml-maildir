I just want to add, I built 2.6.23-rc2 on Aug 4th and this happened on Aug 
12 and I suspend once a day. And the only thing which was odd was the 
uptime, nothing else.
I rebooted with 2.6.23-rc3 today, so the odd uptime is gone.
Should I try 8 suspend cycles or something to reproduce it again?

I did, but what could change? I did not see anything, nothing dmesg, no 
odd uptime etc.
