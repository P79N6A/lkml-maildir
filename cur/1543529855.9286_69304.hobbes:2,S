2 * current->priority - 1 really.  The following is more correct:
                  if (current->counter >= current->priority*2)
                          current->counter = current->priority*2-1;

The exploitation I had in mind is this.  Have a process almost exhaust its
slice, say take its counter down to 2.  Then fork() and let both parent and
child go through a recalculation.  Now the child exits transfering its slice
to the parent.  The parent ends up with a maxed out counter and a slice that
is twice as long as it could have gotten otherwise (and high priority in
the eyes of goodness()).  If it wants an even longer timeslice it can fork()
more than one child and have them exit at appropriate times.  A process can
get a steady supply of free ticks this way.  Of course its slice will reach
0 at some point but it can start all over again after the next
recalculation.  The only tricky part is getting the timing right.
