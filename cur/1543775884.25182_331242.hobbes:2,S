Alan,
Thanks very much for the input.

Yes, indeed that does make it work.

Oh well, so much for the "Linux Compatible" markings on the box... :-)

Yes, I'd imagine so, but I just wanted to make sure that it wasn't a bad
chip etc - generally speaking QA isn't what it used to be for most products
on the market these days.....

OK, I'll try and do that today, and if I get anything meaningful, I'll send
it to the list(s).
One more additional note is that the key came with some s/w that allows you
to partition the key into "private" and "public" areas, where the private
area is accessed by a password.  Naturally, this s/w (Ustorage) is Windows
only; but looking at how it works under Windows it would appear that the key
has some firmware inside that is controlling access etc - could it be that
this firmware hasn't finished initialising by the time Linux tries to read
block 0, which is why the messages occur?
If this is the case, then a subtle delay somewhere in the initialisation
chain may help.  I'm not a Kernel Guru by any stretch, but I imagine the
sequence is something like this:
<key insert>
<usb subsystem identifies device>
<usb-storage driver takes device control> (existing specifiable delay in
here, via "delay_use")
<usb-storage drivers creates /dev/sdX> (via some form of udev interaction, I
guess...)
<sd_mod informed that new SCSI disk exists>
*
<sd_mod tries to read partition table etc>
<sd_mod creates /dev/sdXn entries> (also via udev)
...etc....
Perhaps the ability to create an additional "settle" delay at the "*" above
may help - presumably, I'd need to hack the sd_mod driver, so I'll have a
look there, too.
Thanks,
James Roberts-Thomson
