2.2.15pre15 still suffers from a make xconfig bug:
make xconfig only shows "comment" if they link to submenus, to see what
I mean, check in the "video for Linux" section by enabling Video for
Linux BT848 support (module is sufficient). In make menuconfig, the
comment where to find the MSP 3400 driver shows up once the BT848 driver
is selected (either module or linked-in), in make xconfig, the comment
keeps away. Whether I use wish4.2 or wish8.0 makes no difference.
