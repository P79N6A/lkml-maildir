That information is available in /sys, which is how HAL discovers it.  
If you wanted to, you could bypass HAL and go directly to /sys to 
perform your own discovery.  Also HAL is not a part of the linux kernel, 
therefore a problem in HAL is NOT a problem in linux, even if there were 
no other way to get the information as you ( wrongly ) asserted.
