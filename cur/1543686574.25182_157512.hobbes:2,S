I for one would like to see that.  However:
The simple protocol that it uses needs to be factored out to an 
arch-independent place, and the various archs need to be modified to use 
it.  To get to that point will likely require someone doing it for one 
or two archs and then having enough community clout to convince other 
archs to merge with it.  It could get to the point where it's a pretty 
clean implementation (for debugger hooks ;) ).
No, that isn't something I can take on. :/  (Though I did get it 
partially working on 2.5 XScale.)
