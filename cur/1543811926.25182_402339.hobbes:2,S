thing is, permission() does inode based checks
and the nameidata is not even provided in most
cases, so you cannot rely on that information
anyway
it would probably be better to have some kind
of vfs_permission, which uses dentry/vfsmnt for
decisions on the vfs layer, this would also allow
to cover most of the cases where nameidata is not
available (for example the filep based stuff)
best,
