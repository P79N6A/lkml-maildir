Subject: [PATCH] include/linux/sysctl.h needs linux/compiler.h
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Changes during 2.5.70 added _user tags to various bits in 
include/linux/sysctl.h. __user is defined in linux/compiler.h, which is 
included by linux/kernel.h but only if __KERNEL__ is defined. Compiliing 
uClibc against 2.5.70 fails because __user__ is not defined.
Adding patch below solves the problem (yes, I know, userspace is not 
supposed to use kernel headers...)
