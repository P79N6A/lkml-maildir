 Well, it depends on how you look at it.  If you have PCI, an on-board IDE 
interface and do not want any PCI IDE controllers, then you now have a 
zillion of options to disable instead of just one.  Have a look at 
"arch/mips/configs/sb1250-swarm_defconfig" for an example (hmm..., 
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_SWARM disabled by default -- that should probably be 
changed; I'll cook a patch).  I guess it is not possible to make everyone 
happy at once though, so please do not treat it as a hard objection. :-)
