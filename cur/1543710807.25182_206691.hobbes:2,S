I'm not 100% sure what you mean.  Right now the files in our CVS are 
split between two directories.  There's a "common" directory, which is 
used on both Linux & BSD, and a Linux-specific directory.  Our intention 
is to shift around where some of the files are in our CVS.  I don't 
think we intend to move where things are in the Linux source tree.
That's part of why I'm asking.  From talking to Linus in the past, I 
know that merging in changes is a PITA due to our funky directory 
structure.  I'd like to make that easier. :)
