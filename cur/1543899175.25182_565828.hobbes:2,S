If it is necessary, then, this line should be put wherever such
signoffs go:
Signed-off-by: Douglas W Jones <jones@cs.uiowa.edu>
This implies my bemused permission to freely use anything developed
from my tutorials on the web, not my endorsement of what was done
with that material.  I say bemused because it seems far fetched to
claim that I have any ownership interest in this material.  The author
of a tutorial text clearly owns the tutorial organization and
presentation of that text, but to claim ownership of the ideas being
taught is strange.
