The command line for the final link is wrong.  It should contain
 -Wl,-Bstatic -lbfd -liberty -Wl,-Bdynamic -o ksymoops
You replaced '-Wl' with '-arm-linux-ld', ld did not understand that and
got a segmentation fault trying to handle the unknown parameter.
Correct your command line, and log a problem against binutils that it
cannot cope with unexpected options.

Without a system map, you are not going to get much of a decode.  But
if that is what you want, add 'DEFMAP=' to the make command line.
