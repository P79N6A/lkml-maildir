This is the result of a flush cache error returning a failure and the
device logging the error.  If it was a 48-bit command it should commit to
the GPL (smart extentions), otherwise a 28-bit would commit to 28-bit
smart logs.  Since the Linux does not track the returns on completion, the
report of any flush cache error is worthless.  Since the error reports the
LBA where it happened but that request is long gone, the data is toast.
It will take 2.7 or later to address the data integrity and recovery on a
device that fails completion on a flush.  This is a bad host, but the host
is getting smarter.  The difference is this host's author knows the
issues, and just needs to communicate them out.

This is a DEVICE side problem, the HOST can only respond to the content
returned in the taskfiles.  The DEVICE can LIE all day long and the HOST
can only follow the lead cue from the DEVICE.
