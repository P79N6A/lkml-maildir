Well, I haven't looked at the whole patch yet, but some quick
responses -

That kind of latency is really bad. Could you please check the latency 
with this change in kernel/rcupdate.c -
 void rcu_check_callbacks(int cpu, int user)
 {
        if (user ||
-           (idle_cpu(cpu) && !in_softirq() && hardirq_count() <= 1))
+           (idle_cpu(cpu) && !in_softirq() &&
+                               hardirq_count() <= (1 << HARDIRQ_SHIFT)))
                RCU_qsctr(cpu)++;
        tasklet_schedule(&RCU_tasklet(cpu));
After local_irq_count() went away, the idle CPU check was broken
and that meant that if you had an idle CPU, it could hold up RCU
grace period completion.

It might just be simpler to use completions instead -
	call_rcu(&(handler->rcu), free_nmi_handler, handler);
	init_completion(&handler->completion);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&nmi_handler_lock, flags);
	wait_for_completion(&handler->completion);
and do
	complete(&handler->completion);
in the  the RCU callback.
Also, now I think your original idea of "Don't do this!" :) was right.
Waiting until an nmi handler is seen unlinked could make a task
block for a long time if another task re-installs it. You should
probably just fail installation of a busy handler (checked under
lock).
