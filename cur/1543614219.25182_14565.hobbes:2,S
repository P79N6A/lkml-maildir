My thanks to for Marcelo's efforts...but....
Is there any way we can get Marcelo, Rik, and Andrea to work together on the
"stable" version now (a Linux tribunal)?
If Rik and Andrea just send their patches to Marcelo can we get agreement on
one release version?
It would seem that it's time to converge for the sake of bringing some
stability & simplicity to 2.4.x
There's been way too much discussion/questions on the list from people
wondering which one to use.
I understand Linus' reluctance to incorporate but it just seems like it's
time to converge these branches.
