Well no. MIDI stuff has drivers that interface with precision timers
in your audio board such as Creative Labs Soundblaster. They have
a serial connection that, with a simple adapter becomes MIDI I/O.
These boards, and even the ones built into motherboards can (do)
generate and receive precision MIDI.
Although I use Cakewalk Home Studio for my MIDI stuff, there is
similar software and drivers for Linux. Search on "MIDI Linux".
In any event, the MIDI stuff could care less about the usual user-
mode timers. That's now how MIDI works. If you intend to make some
MIDI stuff in user-mode, not using hardware timing, your code is
broken from the start. Note that M$ has worse timer resolution
than Linux and the Cakewalk stuff is superb.
If there are MIDI programs that are, as you say, dreadful on
linux, then it's because the programs suck, not because of any
kernel timers.
