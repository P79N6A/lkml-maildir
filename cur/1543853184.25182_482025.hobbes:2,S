True - I just think that some defined ordering semantics might be
helpful for people trying to use workqueues and kthreads in
the future. It would also help us determine if the current usage
is safe as well...

And that is my great concern - there really is nothing to prevent
a fs from having I/O outstanding while the suspend image is being
created.

*nod*
I would also prefer to start with something we know is safe and work from
there.
