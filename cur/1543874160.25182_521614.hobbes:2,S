Agreed, it should be fixed generically.
I think the right fix would be to make the notifier call an inline
that checks the call chain in the caller. That would be cheap enough,
except for the cache line that might need to be referenced.
For the cache line the short term fix would be to find some other
global cache line that is referenced in the fault path anyways and put
it on the same (e.g. by just putting the variable next to it or
using a shared structure) 
Longer term might be something like Ben LaHaise's patch that can patch
code inline for rarely-read globals.

No, we should keep the debugger hooks here. Otherwise there will be a zillion
external patches patches code in at these places for the various debuggers,
resulting in a merge nightmare for lots of people.
