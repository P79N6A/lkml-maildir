2.4.0-test12+ip_fragment.c.patch is still up. I hadn't previously tried
client-side mounts on that box, just exports.
I tried to reproduce the problem with nfs home directory mount + X. I am
unable to generate the error -- it works for me. I think Alexey is right.
There may be either coincidence or confusion in the report.
Btw, I am able to compile a kernel over an nfs mount with this. Very handy
since the remote is much faster at it.
Cheers,
Tom
