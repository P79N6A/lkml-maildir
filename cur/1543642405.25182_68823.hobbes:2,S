 I was wrong; the problem i was experimenting was due to a symbolic link
problem (i was compiling the module with other kernel headers). Since
the CRC of a versioned symbol is based on the function arguments i
thought that the different type of the argument (well, is the same type with 
different name) has something to do with the error i was getting.
 I apologize for wasting readers' time.
Regards,
Juanma
