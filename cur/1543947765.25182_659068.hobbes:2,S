I experience the same problem when executing "ls /etc".

The patch didn't revert cleanly because of the two subsequent 
ext2-related patches, so I had to revert the three of them. It fixed the 
problem. Then I applied only the "ext2_readdir() filp->f_pos fix" patch 
again and the problem came back. HTH.
