That seems like a bug, and if so this patch goes the wrong direction. 
(If the 32-bit code has another solution for the same problem, they 
should be unified.)
The trimming of uncachable memory affects both 32- and 64-bit kernels; 
it's the same hardware, and even 32-bit kernels (with PAE) can access 
memory above 4 GB.
