Which is what the ghost stuff does, maybe not in the cleanest way, but
that is still the only thing that it does.

The end result is exactly the same as what the ghost stuff does now.
The common code between sd and sr is "read a block". This is code that
should be shared. Moreover, that's about the only "real" thing that
should be in those drivers. Of course "sr" also supports a few ioctls,
and "sd" also does writing.
