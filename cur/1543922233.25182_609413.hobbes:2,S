Sorry, I missed your answer when resending since it was in a different 
thread.
I'm still not convinced we really need the nsp32_msg() here but you are 
the maintainer and it's not a big deal anyway
A BUG() would IMHO be similarly pointless as the nsp32_msg() at this 
point and there's no value in changing code only for the sake of the 
Coverity checker.
