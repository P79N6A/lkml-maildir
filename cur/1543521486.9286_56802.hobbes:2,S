You're not the first to get surprised by this, but a hardware guy could
guess the reason right away.  The results aren't surprising at all if
you know that:
    a) Linux is quite light weight in the system call and context areas
    b) if the size of the buffer is small, it will fit in the on chip cache
You are seeing is the effect of spilling out of the L1 cache.
