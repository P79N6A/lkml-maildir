Fantastic, thanks for running these tests.

We were able to set the pending bit but then found that list_empty()
failed on the work queue's entry list_head.  Let's call this memory
corruption of some kind.

It was completing an AIO request.
        ret = blockdev_direct_IO_own_locking(rw, iocb, inode,
                iomap.iomap_target->bt_bdev,
                iov, offset, nr_segs,
                xfs_get_blocks_direct,
                xfs_end_io_direct);
        if (unlikely(ret <= 0 && iocb->private))
                xfs_destroy_ioend(iocb->private);
It looks like xfs_vm_direct_io() is destroying the ioend in the case
where direct IO is returning -EIOCBQUEUED.  Later the AIO will complete
and try to call queue_work on the freed ioend.  This wasn't a problem
before when blkdev_direct_IO_*() would just return the number of bytes
in the op that was in flight.  That test should be
        if (unlikely(ret != -EIOCBQUEUED && iocb->private))
I'll update the patch set and send it out.
This makes me worry that XFS might have other paths that need to know
about the magical -EIOCBQUEUED case which actually means that a AIO DIO
is in flight.
Could I coerce some XFS guys into investigating if we might have other
problems with trying to bubble -EIOCBQUEUED up from
blockdev_direct_IO_own_locking() up through to xfs_file_aio_write()'s
caller before calling xfs_end_io_direct()?
