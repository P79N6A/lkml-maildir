So what's wrong with having the generic code, and for those with a fast
semapore add an arch specific?
#define mutex_lock down
#define mutex_unlock up
#define mutex_trylock(x) (!down_trylock(x))
Until the mutex code is updated to a fast arch specific implementation.
Let me restate, that the generic code should not be this, but each arch
can have this if they already went through great lengths in making a fast
semaphore.
Heck put the above defines in the generic code, with a define
linux/mutex.h:
#ifdef HAVE_ARCH_MUTEX
#include <asm/mutex.h>
#else
#ifdef HAVE_FAST_SEMAPHORE
#define <defines here>
#else
generic code here
#endif /* HAVE_FAST_SEMAPHORE */
#endif /* HAVE_ARCH_MUTEX */
