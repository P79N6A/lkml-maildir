Erm, I've lost context here but it's completely legit for hardware
to NOT support MWI, so it is in no way an error if it's not set.
(Memory-Write-Invalidate is just a more efficient way to write data
that may be cached; if the device can't issue those cycles, there's
no loss of correctness.)
Since it's not an error, there should be no such printk ... which
is exactly how it's coded above.
Who is issuing the printk on a non-error code path??
