The semantics your code seems to care about are not those of a memory 
barrier (which deals with ordering), but of a flush of the write combining 
buffers.  That's an important high level distinction as they are implemented 
differently across architectures.  Please rename the macro something like 
flush_wc() and document it as such, at which point I remove my objection.
