Linus,
Just take a vote and start tagging files and ignore this needless 
diatribe. It is was it is, I seriously doubt you will
get all of Linux moved to GPL3 as a monolith, since you will never get 
concensus. You should fork a GPL3 kernel and let people decide
whether their code goes in or not. If they don't want to move to it, new 
people can contribute new code. Start a 2.8 tree or whatever that is 
GPL3 only.
Jeff
