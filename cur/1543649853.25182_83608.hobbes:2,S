Yes you're right. I didn't do this before because previous versions
needed to support 2.2/2.4 kernels and building it as a module.
For what values of cpu is per_cpu(var,cpu) valid? For those where
cpu_online(cpu) is true, or those where cpu_possible(cpu) is true?
(I need to convert a memset() on the per_cpu_cache[] array to the
per_cpu(,) framework.)
I'll fix this and announce a new version later today.
