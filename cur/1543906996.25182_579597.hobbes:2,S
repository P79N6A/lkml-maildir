We're going in circles here. We have two different timer APIs for a 
reason, only because hrtimer provide better resolution, doesn't 
automatically make them the better generic timer.
There's no problem to provide a high resolution sleep, but there is also 
no reason to mess with msleep, don't fix what ain't broken...
