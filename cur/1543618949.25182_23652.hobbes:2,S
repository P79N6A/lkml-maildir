Ok, it was working for a while, even after a reboot...
but now

This went unnoticed earlier.... until it happened again:
Jan 28 20:26:03 bouncybouncy kernel: eth0: Transmitter underflow?,
status 2008.
Jan 28 20:26:06 bouncybouncy kernel: NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth0: transmit
timed out
Jan 28 20:26:06 bouncybouncy kernel: eth0: Transmit timed out, status
0000, PHY status 782d, resetting...
Jan 28 20:26:06 bouncybouncy kernel: eth0: reset finished after 10005
microseconds.
That repeated over and over again(every 30 seconds or so) until I got
back:
grep "Jan 28.*eth0" /var/log/messages|wc -l
    328
After reloading the driver it started working again:
linuxfet.c : v3.23 05/15/2001
  The PCI BIOS has not enabled the device at 0/144!  Updating PCI
command 0003->0007.
eth0: VIA PCI 10/100Mb Fast Ethernet Adapter                      
eth0: IO Address = 0xe800, MAC Address = 00:50:2c:01:64:a9, IRQ = 11.
eth0: MII PHY found at address 1, status 0x782d advertising 01e1 Link
0021.
eth0: netdev_open() irq 11.
eth0: Done netdev_open(), status 881a MII status: 782d.
I think that last message might be a clue on why this is happening...
