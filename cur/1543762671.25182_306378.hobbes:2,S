So, the fact that someone else is doing something illegal, makes it
acceptable for you to do the same thing?  Please, talk to a lawyer about
this issue if you have _any_ questions.
And, to paraphrase Larry McVoy, if you can't afford to consult a proper
IP lawyer, then your IP isn't worth risking.  Release it under the GPL
and you will have no problems.
