  I don't think you'll get more feedback now. Just write the patch,
benchmark it with your workload and also some others (basically, there should be
no difference) and then submit the patch together with the performance
numbers and some rationale (if it's your first submission, see
Documentation/SubmittingPatches). Give also CC to Andrew <akpm@linux-foundation.org>
and ask him to put it into -mm kernels for testing.
