Al,
Under lk 2.4 (rh9) this is in my log:
Sep 25 10:37:53 localhost kernel: SCSI device sda: 1024000 512-byte hdwr 
sectors (524 MB)
Sep 25 10:37:53 localhost kernel: sda: Write Protect is off
Sep 25 10:37:53 localhost kernel:  sda: sda1 sda2 sda3 sda4
Attached is sector 0 of the device and the output of
"fdisk -l".
lk 2.6.0-test5-bk10 also thinks the device has 4 malformed
partitions.

It is non obvious. W2K and XP handled the USB key without
a problem. An organisation bought a bunch of these USB
"floppies" and expected them to work with linux (like
other USB mass storage devices they had experienced). I
was given one to find out what was wrong ...
BTW Another interesting aspect of this USB key is that
some sectors read before they are ever written can give
a "medium error, unrecoverable read". Once the sector
is written the problem goes away. This shouldn't be a
problem in normal use. [I guess at least sector 0 is
written in the factory :-) ]
