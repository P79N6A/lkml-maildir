I don't think this is sufficient -- there must
be protection against arbitrary SHM_LOCKs.

How about the following:
For *both* SHM_LOCK and SHM_UNLOCK, the process should either 
be the owner or the creator of the object or have the 
CAP_IPC_LOCK capability.
Note the following:
1. SHM_LOCK should be covered so that a process with a high
   RLIMIT_MEMLOCK is allowed to lock arbitrary segments 
   that it  doesn't own.
2. A framework like the above is consistent with the 
   semantics of the existing shmctl() IPC_SET and IPC_RMID
   operations (see the shmctl(2) man page).
Cheers,
Michael
