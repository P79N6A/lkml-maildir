I am experiencing exactly the same problem with traceroute-0.6.2 
running on SuSE 10.0 together with kernel 2.6.14. The whole thing
happens on a single core dual Opteron machine. I've tested this
kernel version on that machine only, yet.
I've also tried the latest traceroute version (1.0.2) from
  
ftp://ftp.lst.de/pub/people/okir/traceroute/
and experienced the same behaviour.
Olaf Kirch has just sent me a patch against 2.6.14. It has also 
been discussed in NETDEV. 
This fixed it for me:
