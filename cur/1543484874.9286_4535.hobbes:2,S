Hi All,
I have a real problem that I am stumped on.
I have just done a clean install of RH-5.2 on a machine that was 
happily running an old slackware release.
The problem is that the network appears to initialise but doesn't 
actually function properly.
Basicly, I have an old machine, Cyrix 686L, 64MB memory, Adaptec 
1542CF SCSI (disks, tape and CD hanging off it), an SMC Ultra UTP 
card and an old S3 PCI video card in the box (I have stripped other 
stuff out to try to isolate the problem).
The symptoms are that I cannot ping out or into the machine. It will 
ping the local address but that means little as it doesn't actually 
go out of the card. The hardware is all OK - I have checked the SMC 
card in DOS mode and also changed the UTP cable.
I can see traffic is getting to the card by the LED's on the spine of 
the card and if I run tcpdump I can see ipx-netbios packets floating 
around there but only intermittently, I cannot see any ICMP packets 
but the machine does send ARP requests out. I can see those on 
another machine but not on the host in question. I do see them 
intermittently.
The packets shown in tcpdump seem to be a couple of minutes behind 
when they were actually sent if that's any clue.
This really has me stumped and I have no clue where to start even 
looking at this one.
The hardware does seem ok and the software was straight off the CD 
install  - three times !!
I even tried an install of Caldera 1.2 with the same symptoms.
For all the world, it seems like a hardware interrupt problem but it 
just can't be unless something really odd is happening in the 
software. All is fine if I boot into DOS from floppy and check the 
net card operation.
If someone could give me a hint as to where to look, I would really 
appreciate it. I am not new to Linux but I haven't ever struck this 
type of problem before. I am also not a code hacker, so be gentle.
Regards,
Brad.
