    The appletouch driver doesn't work properly on the MacBook
(non-Pro).  It claims the device, and sort of functions, but is
basically unusable.
    If this goes in, and blacklists the MacBook touchpad too, Macbook
users will be unhappy.  I think the MacBook and the -Pro use the same
IDs, though, which makes a problem for this patch until appletouch is
fixed on MacBooks.
