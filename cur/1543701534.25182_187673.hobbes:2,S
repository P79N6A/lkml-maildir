Splitting is evil, but unfortunately it's a necessary evil... There are
a few kernel helpers to make supporting it easier (see bio_split()). Not
so sure how well that'll work for you, you may have to do the grunt work
yourself.

Only partially. Read my email: you _must_ accept a page addition to an
empty bio. You can refuse others. For the single page case, you may need
to split.

Does UDF use mpage? The fact that it doesn't trigger on UDF doesn't mean
that packet writing isn't breaking the API :)
