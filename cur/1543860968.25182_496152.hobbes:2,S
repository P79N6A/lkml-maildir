... and acquires it again after woken from sleep. That can be a problem, which 
will lead to the problem described here:
	
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/7/374
In brief:
keventd thread					hotplug thread
--------------					--------------
  run_workqueue()
	|
     work_fn()
	 |
	flush_workqueue()
	     |	
	   flush_cpu_workqueue
		|				cpu_down()
	     mutex_unlock(wq_mutex);		     |
	(above opens window for hotplug)	   mutex_lock(wq_mutex);
    		|				   /* bring down cpu */	
	     wait_for_completition();		     notifier(CPU_DEAD, ..)
		| 				       workqueue_cpu_callback
		| 				        cleanup_workqueue_thread
		|					  kthread_stop()
		|
		|
	     mutex_lock(wq_mutex); <- Can deadlock
The kthread_stop() will wait for keventd() thread to exit, but keventd()
is blocked on mutex_lock(wq_mutex) leading to a deadlock.
