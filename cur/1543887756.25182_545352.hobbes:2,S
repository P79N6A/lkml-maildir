Well you added a new locking level and changed the locking hierachy!

SLUB can only allocate from a per cpu slab. You will have to reserve one 
slab per cpu anyways unless we flush the cpu slab after each access. Same 
thing is true for SLAB. It wants objects in its per cpu queues.

Because it is for all practical purposes a heavily accessed read only 
structure. Modifications only occur to per node and per cpu structures.
In a 4k systems any write will kick out the kmem_cache cacheline in 4k 
processors.
