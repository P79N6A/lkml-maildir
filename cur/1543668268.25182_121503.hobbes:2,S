It looks to me like something is calling schedule_delayed_work()
(which calls queue_delayed_work(), which starts a timer) and then
freeing the work_struct before it's executed.
Here's a list of places that use schedule_delayed_work() where the
work_struct might be kmalloc()ed.  Are you using any of these drivers?
(Obviously you're using tty_io, so that bears some looking at)
    drivers/char/cyclades.c
    drivers/char/mxser.c
    drivers/char/tty_io.c
    drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_tty.c
    drivers/message/fusion/mptlan.c
    drivers/net/hamradio/baycom_epp.c
    drivers/net/plip.c
    drivers/scsi/imm.c
    drivers/scsi/ppa.c
If tty_io.c is the problem, then maybe something like the patch below
will find the culprit.
