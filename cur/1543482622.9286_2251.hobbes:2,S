Could you apply this my patch against clean 2.2.0:
ftp://e-mind.com/pub/linux/arca-tree/2.2.0_arca-4.gz
and tell me if you still can reproduce the process stuck in D state?
There was a big race in 2.2.0. I know at least some of the report of
process in D state are been automagically fixed fixing the mmput/get race,
but maybe there are some other things to fix...

This doesn't look like the mmget/mmput race but maybe...
Thanks for having applyed my semaphore deadlock detector and given me
back a very useful report.
