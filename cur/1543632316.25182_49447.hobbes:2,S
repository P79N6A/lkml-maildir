Using ERR_PTR/PTR_ERR/IS_ERR is probably the correct thing to do, but 
that codebase predates the "error pointer" macros by about 9 years ;)

The 1000 vs 1024 thing is just another "random number". I don't know what
the right number is myself, it may be worth trying to pick one that is
uniformly easy to test against, for example. Many architectures are better
at some constants than others.
