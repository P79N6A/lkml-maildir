It is not caused by kernel preemption.  Your subject is a little
misleading, since you never tested without it.
Is the system load average ~2 (as you say in the next paragraph) when it
skips?  If nicing it fixes the problem, then we see that the system is
capable of meeting the scheduling deadlines.
Is the interactivity estimator giving it a penalty?  What does:
	ps -eo pid,user,priority,nice,command
show for mpg321 ?

Well, the load average is the number of runnable processes.  It is not
exactly the same as processor usage.
Are you having an average of one half to two processes runnable over a
five minute period?  The load average suggests so.
