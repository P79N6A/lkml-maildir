Subject: slowdown on primary network interface on news server... (2.2.10

I've got a news server that has recently become multi-homed. until now it
has behaved flawlessly for a few months, however now the interface that
has the default route slows to a crawl after running for a few hours, the
second interface is unaffected. no kernel messages accompany this behavior
however downing the interface and bring it back up again fix the problem.
generally it takes 8-11 hours for this issue to manifest itself.
sample pinges through each interface follow:

normally what you'd expect to see over eth0 is:
PING hammer.uoregon.edu (128.223.220.29): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 128.223.220.29: icmp_seq=0 ttl=255 time=0.2 ms

64 bytes from 128.223.220.29: icmp_seq=3 ttl=255 time=0.2 ms
since there's just a intel fast ether switch between them.
hammer and hammer-hpc.ogig.net are two interfaces on the same remote
machine.
the machine is:
abit-bx6 2.0
intel p2-233
192mb ram 
promise ultra-66 ide controller
2 x 9gb wd expert  ata/66
2 x 18gb wd expert ata/66 
smc etherpower II 10/100 (eth0)
bay networks ga-620 gigabit-sx gig ether (eth1)
the kernel is:
2.2.10 
with the addition of:
2.2.10.uniform-ide-6.20.draco.patch 
raid0145-19990724-2.2.10.gz
