Today I upgraded to-ac7 and since that I have had serious trouble with 
any GL application sI have tried to run. The problesm seems to be 
dropped frames and/or complete freeze up. I did not experience this 
behavior in -ac5. (I skipped ac6). I use the latest release of NVidia's 
drivers. Has anyone seen any simmilar behavior?
Thank you,
Sean Jones
