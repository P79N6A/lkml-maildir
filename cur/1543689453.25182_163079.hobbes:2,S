That will work for the PCI case.  It does force us to maintain a
remap_page_range64() in arch/ppc, duplicating code, and creating a
maintainer headache.  I don't think we can hack set_pte() (so as
to call the standard remap_page_range()) to trap and add the upper
bits because there is not enough context to make the right decision.
We've got to have the remap_page_range64() for PPC4xx-specific OCP
drivers too.
A remap_page_range() that even took a paddr_t would be helpful if
not some resource based remapper.
I suppose we could even use the HAVE_PCI_MMAP approach to make
mem.c usable with a PPC44x specific hack.  Of course, a
remap_page_range() with a paddr_t arg would also help here.
