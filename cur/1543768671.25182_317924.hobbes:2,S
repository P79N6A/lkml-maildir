That is mostly because we encode the zone number in there, which
never seemed like a particularly useful optimization to me (because
zone is not that expensive to recompute using a small hash table)
If the zone number was removed there would be plenty of bits.
There are 12 bits left  then, which is plenty.
In fact one bit is already reserved for PAT like this (PG_uncached),
PAT would probably only need another one so that write combining
can be expressed too. That could be even done without getting rid of the 
zone number.

Looks quite ugly and overkill.
