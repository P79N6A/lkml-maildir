Subject: [patch 19/40] MSI: Use correct data offset for 32-bit MSI in read_msi_msg()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

patch cbf5d9e6b9bcf03291cbb51db144b3e2773a8a2d in mainline.
While reading the MSI code trying to find a reason why MSI wouldn't
work for devices that have a 32-bit MSI address capability, I noticed
that read_msi_msg() seems to read the message data from the wrong
offset in this case.
