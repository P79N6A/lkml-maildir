Subject: [2.6.13 bug] i386: Wall clock running at double speed
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

I'm running an i386 kernel on an AMD Turion notebook with the cpufreq drivers
enabled (both ACPI P-states and AMD PowerNow.)  My system clock is running
twice as fast as it should.
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/stats shows the system is spending over
99% of its time running at 800MHz (half speed.)
CONFIG_MK7=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_APIC=y
CONFIG_X86_UP_IOAPIC=y
From /proc/interrupts:
  0:  136523787    IO-APIC-edge  timer
LOC:   68264003
The local APIC timer is getting half as many interrupts as the system
timer.
