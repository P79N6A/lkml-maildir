Wait, first off, are we talking about 2.4, or 2.5 here?  For 2.5 I think
everything is covered, right?

No, I do not think so.  I think the way 2.5 does this is the correct
way.  But as I did that patch, I might be a bit biased :)
We could just force every arch to export the same functions that i386
and ia64 does, that shouldn't be a big deal.  I think this would solve
the problem on 2.4 for pci hotplug, as ACPI is already "cheating" and
doing this right now...
thanks,
