   I haven't seen the inclusion of this patch in the 2.3.x kernels that came
   out after its posting. I'd like to know whether this is at least in the
   "patch queue". I hope it was not forgotten in the dust, because it's a
   very important feature for serial devices that support very high speeds
   (such as the Cyclades-Z, which supports 921.6Kbps).
Yes, it's on my patch queue.  I haven't had a chance to look at it in
detail yet, but it looks good in general, and I hope to get to it soon.
