MacOSX uses HFS+ by default.  As a result, 99% of
people using MacOSX are going to use HFS+.  I'm
a serious Linux developer, but if I owned a Mac,
I'd probably leave it set to HFS+, since I like
to keep my systems vanilla (it makes it easier to
pick up my stuff and use it on someone else's machine).
Thus it's not just Cygwin that's affected; this is
a real issue for MacOSX as commonly configured.
