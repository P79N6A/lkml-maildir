I'm not sure I understand the question.  We already do a number of
capable type security checks in dummy functions. See dummy_settime() as
just one example.
If we have !CONFIG_SECURITY we don't have any security protections (how
could we?  we turned them off) so we don't get into dummy hooks.  If we
do checks or not in uncompiled code doesn't seem to me to matter.
Maybe I'm just confused...
