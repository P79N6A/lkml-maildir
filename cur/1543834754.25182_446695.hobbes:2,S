We tend to be biased against doing things in kernel headers just for
userspace programs.  I'd suggest either (1) drop the #define false/true's,
or (2) if a compelling userspace need is presented that wins the day,
at least comment the dang defines.
From the perspective of what's in the current kernel source, this
pair of defines has lost all sense that I can see.  So they need a
justifying comment if they stay.
