Indeed.
In fact, I think that in Linux 0.01 it actually _used_ all bits.
I remember how I was chasing a strange bug in bash, which turned out to
be because _bash_ used "short" somewhere to store a pid.  And this was
long long before Linux development and me became arrogant enough to say
"oh, bash is broken, tell Chet to fix it", so what I ended up doing was
to just make sure that yes, "pid_t" was still 32-bit, but we only ever
selected pids in the 15-bit range. 
We could start using 32-bit pid's any day, but for (a) /proc and (b) I'm
not sure what makes sense in a cluster. Do we want to have the high bits
be just high bits, or do we want them to be cluster machine ID, or do we
want them to be thread-ID related?
So the dynamic range of pids stays at 15 bits until it's clear what the
right thing is. The type stays at 32 bits..
