Of course there are colliding files already available and easyly
generate-able. So a malicous attack is already possible. 
Which is especially nasty because one can proof GIT obeject file system is
broken. However I dont think it is a problem for Linux Source Control
purpose, ever.
However using a combined hash might be a good idea, here. So you silence the
critics since they have no eploit samples handy. :) Or at least go with FIPS
180-2.
