To be able to suck in USB (and some of the other drivers), two changes
need to be made to the core:
1. the change_speed method needs to be handled differently; we currently
   assume a UART-style implementation here.  We need to change this
   around before 2.6 anyway for ports which don't support all the
   termios settings (SuSv3 requires that any unimplemented features
   retain their original values, so for example if we don't have RTS
   and CTS lines on a particular implementation, CRTSCTS should be
   initially off and not turn on-able.)
2. USB devices want "packets" of data to write rather than the ring-
   buffer we currently use for UARTs.
(time to start ebaying for USB serial devices...)
