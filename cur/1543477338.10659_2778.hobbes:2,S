Hi Martin,

Read what I wrote.  "If you change your configuration."  That's why the
dependencies span the entire tree: so that if the user turns on a new file
system or a new network protocol, they don't have to run 'make dep' again.
The user doesn't know which options correspond to which directories.
If "make dep" visits only the subdirectories currently in use, then the
user has to run a "make dep" after every configuration change.  My way,
they don't (unless they have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS on, which introduces a
whole set of gotchas).

On my machine, it's 3%, by actual measurement.  I trust my measurements
more than yours.

You really have a problem reading what I write.  Do I need to use
html or something to get your attention?

Do it.  Turn it on, capture the output of "make dep", and grep for
genksyms.
martin> Just for arguments sake, I actually implemented it, and it
martin> cut the dep time down to 38 seconds,
Color me unimpressed.  By your own figures, you cut your build time
by 6%.  But you broke the dependencies that the user needs in case
of reconfigration.
Hey, if you want fast broken dependencies, just don't run make dep
*at all* and your kernel will still build.  The first time.
(Unless you turn on CONFIG_MODVERSIONS).  That gives more speed-up
than your patch, and it's just as broken with regard to configuration
changes as your patch.
