I think nobody shall suffer of it.
Just make a kernel with everithing needed for encryption but only
xor encryption, and a separate patch that replaces xor by DES
Everybody will be able to use the one they want.
People ontside france can download nonDES version and patch it
People inside france cannot download DES version and unpatch it,
as they arent allowed to download a version with DES if Linus hasnt
declared it to the government.
