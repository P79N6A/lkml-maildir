Subject: [-mm PATCH 0/10] Memory controller introduction (v7)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi, Andrew,
Here's version 7 of the memory controller (against 2.6.23-rc2-mm2). I was
told "7" is a lucky number, so I am hopeful this version of the patchset will
get merged ;)
The salient features of the patches are
a. Provides *zero overhead* for non memory controller users
b. Enable control of both RSS (mapped) and Page Cache (unmapped) pages
c. The infrastructure allows easy addition of other types of memory to control
d. Provides a double LRU: global memory pressure causes reclaim from the
   global LRU; a container on hitting a limit, reclaims from the per
   container LRU
The documentation accompanying this patch has more details on the design
and usage.
Changelog since version 6
1. Port to 2.6.23-rc3-mm1
2. Add new documentation
Tested the patches (with config disabled) and kernbench, lmbench on an
x86_64 box.
For more detailed test results, comments on usage and detailed changelog
please see version 6 of the patches
