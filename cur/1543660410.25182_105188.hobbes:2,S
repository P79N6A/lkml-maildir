Er, yes. And what's your point? 
There is _no_ magic that will find the kernel you want to build against
today without any input from you. Using the build tree for the
currently-running kernel, if installed in the standard place, is as good a
default as any. Of course you should be permitted to override that default.
You remain free to put your build trees wherever you want -- with the
obvious proviso that if you put them somewhere other than the standard
place, you need to tell the out-of-tree build process where to find the tree
you want to build against. This seems to be entirely irrelevant to the
original question.
