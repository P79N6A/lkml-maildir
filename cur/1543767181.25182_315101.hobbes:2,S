We are discussing the equivalent of dnotify as a potential candidate for
the first minor version of NFSv4, but not inotify.
The purpose of our dnotify implementation is address the needs of things
like file browsers that don't really care about synchronous notification
of changes, but that do currently cause a lot of unnecessary traffic on
the wire due to constantly polling stat() and doing readdir() updates.
The jury is still out as to whether or not the callbacks actually do
reduce on-the-wire traffic, though, so we may drop it.
What kind of real-world applications exist out there that need inotify
functionality, and what sort of requirements do they have (in particular
w.r.t. the notification mechanism)?
Cheers,
  Trond
