Actually its somewhat of a misreading.
The first sentence of the man pages for select suggests that something 
interesting has happened inbetween select()'s.
Later on it states "more precisely, to see if a read will not block", 
which is still different from "if characters become available for reading".
The "precisely" fits my issue, and not the others.
