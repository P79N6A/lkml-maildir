I agree with that idea in principle, although for quite a while
something else is required, to deal with older kernels.  You'll notice
that my fragment greps for SMP from the kernel's Makefile: that is to
deal with 2.2 kernels and isn't required for 2.4 kernels.  This is not
an issue if you only care about future-compatibility.
Fortunately, the file $(KERNEL_SOURCE)/arc/$(ARCH)/Makefile provides
most of the variables like CFLAGS et al.
Unfortunately, determining ARCH is rather ugly.  I copied the expression
from the kernel's top level Makefile.
One more thing: some systems do not have a /lib/modules directory.  On
those systems it's good to hunt in /usr/src/linux.

The file needs to be created even if you don't do `make modules'.  Some
kernels will support third party modules, but don't actually have any
modules of their own.

This must depend on the configuration somehow.  If the kernel's
reconfigured, a new file needs to be created.  For 2.2 kernels it must
depend on whether SMP is defined too.
