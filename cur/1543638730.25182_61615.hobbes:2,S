Sorry, should have said more about raid arrays. Drives are partitioned 
as follows:
hda1, hdc1 = 4GB
hda2, hdc2 = Extended part - remainder of drive
hda5, hdc5 = 2GB = raid1, md0 /boot
hda6, hdc6 = ~15GB = raid0, md1 /usr
hda7, hdc7 = ~15GB = raid0, md2 /home
hda8, hdc8 = 1.5GB = raid0, /
hda9, hdc9 = remainder = swap
I agree, it seems as though you could see preempt lower performance, but 
again, I haven't seen that either. In fact, the 2.4.18 kernel I was 
using before was compiled with preempt also and showed ~68MB/Sec on md1,md2.
As for changes I may have made to .config? Nothing new. 2.4.19-rc1 
compiled with xfs and preempt worked well also. I tried looking for 
differences in raid drivers, but there were none to the raid0 driver. 
ide-pdc202xx.c contained many changes, but I'm not a kernel hacker and 
couldn't spot anything that might have affected this. Odd that it shows 
up even under hdparm. Interestingly, when testing with bonnie++, the 
overall sequential output was similar to the higher performing older 
kernels. However, creates, deletes, and rewrites were all down 
significantly.
