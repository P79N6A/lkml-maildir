Which version of Comedi are you using?  In comedi-0.7.64 (the most
recent that I can find), I see:
  comedi-0.7.64/comedi/kcomedilib/kcomedilib_main.c:
        int comedi_open(unsigned int minor)
In comedilib-0.7.18, I see:
  comedilib-0.7.18/include/comedilib.h:
        comedi_t *comedi_open(const char *fn);
but of course that version is meant to be called from user space.
I can't find the string "pathname" in any Comedi code anywhere.
