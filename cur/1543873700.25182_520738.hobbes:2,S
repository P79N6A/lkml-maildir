Perhaps the problem can be dealt with using ELF relocations.
There is another case, discussed yesterday on netdev, where run-time
resolution of ELF relocations would be useful (for
very-very-very-read-only variables) so if it can solve this problem
too it would be nice to have a generic infrastructure for it.
