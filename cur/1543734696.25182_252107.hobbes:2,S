Hi all,
Here is a bunch of small updates / fix for Freescale MPC52xx. Some of 
them are now required for a proper compilation.
They mostly only modify the mpc52xx specific code and not much common code.
Theses are in my tree since some time now and have been tested by 
several peoples.
As usual, a BK tree is available with all of theses changes :

Comments / Reports are welcome.
