     Except doing that is A Bad Thing, because if you change the kernel
     interface out from under the library the old libraries won't work.
     There are certainly times when you have to change the kernel
     interfaces (fixing time_t, widening out uid/gids, etc) but, even
     if all of the user programs go in through libfoo.a, it's something
     that should be done with the knowledge that it's going to throw
     many spanners into the works for everyone.

     david parsons \bi/ not that library interfaces are particular gems of
                    \/                                    stability either.
