signalfd_lockctx is "private" to signalfd_lock/signalfd_unlock. But lk->sighand
is used only by signalfd_lock(). I'd suggest to remove it.

I tried to avoid this comment, but can't help myself :)
This is a matter of taste, of course, but imho this is a classical "hide the
problem" example.
Why "else if (sig > 0)" ? sig can't be == 0. In my opinion, it is better to
add BUG_ON(!sig), but use just "else".
Oleg.
