Is there agenda emulator, somewhere? Is there their root filesystem
available for download? [Besides, anyone knows of vtech helio emulator
for linux? Only version I saw was windows...]
I'm running linux on philips velo, which is similar to agenda, and I
guess I could use some of their stuff.
(Anybody knows about support of audio on r39xx companion chip? Or
about voltmeters support?)
