Dick,
You are so full of shit.  There are no additonal restrictions, just the
restrictions of the GPL; period.   Adding _GPL to the symbol does not
place any additional restriction on the people who are already bound by
the GPL.  You were much easier to endure when you were just pretending to
have invented RLE.
