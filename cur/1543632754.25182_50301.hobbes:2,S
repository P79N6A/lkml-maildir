Hi, I built a kernel module. I can load it into the
kernle using insmod command. But each time when I
reboot my computer I couldn't find it any more. I mean
I need to use the insmod to load the module each time
I reboot the computer. How can I modify the
configuration so that the Linux OS can load my module
automatically during reboot? I need to copy my module
to the following directory?
  /lib/modules/2.4.7-10/
I've done that. But it doesn't work.
Any help will be appreciated.
