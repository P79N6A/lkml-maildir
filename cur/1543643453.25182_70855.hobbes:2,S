Since it is the latest official Suse-2.4.18 from SLES I assume this patch
is not included.

All disks are dead. The md0 device is missing. The same should be true for
md1, since there is no difference in setup. Why should the raid1 no report
both mirrors as dead ?

How would the failing of all Pathes then be noticed ?

This might well be, since I don't found the qlogic-driver very impressing
so far. To use md-multipath the multipathing (failover) functionality from
the driver was disabled.
