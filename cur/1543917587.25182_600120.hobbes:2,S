The following is a series of patches related to coding standards.  The first
patch updates the CodingStandards document with respect to printk debugging
and un/likely use; the second patch updates the usage string for
checkpatch.pl; the third patch introduces a new small perl script that can
be used to check coding-standards compliance on multiple source files.  This
new script, called check-coding-standards.pl, produces output in a standard
compiler-error format, which can be parsed by assorted tools including text
editors and help users locate the file that had the error and the offending
line-number more quickly.
