They would simply stay behind CONFIG_BROKEN for longer, because fewer
people would test them.
Also, remember that some things might only give compile errors under
certain circumstances.  The _vast_ majority of kernels include TCP/IP
support, for example, so something that breaks when it's not
configured could easily go unnoticed for ages - does that mean it
should be put behind CONFIG_BROKEN when it's discovered?
John.
