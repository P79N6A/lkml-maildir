Thanks.

I think that in most cases, the race doesn't matter if
shrink_dcache_memory misses a dentry because someone else is holding a
temporary reference, it really doesn't matter.
Similarly most callers of shrink_dcache_parent are happy with a
best-effort.
Unmount is a special case because it wants to 'shrink' *all* of the
dentries for the filesystem.  In that case, someone holding a
transient reference s a bad thing.  In other cases it is, at best, a
minor inconvenience.

I should have been more explicit that the patch was against
2.6.16-rc5-mm2.  This contains some dcache patches to allow nfs
filesystem to share superblocks, and one of the patches replaces the
calls to shrink_dcache_parent and shrink_dcache_anon with a single
call to a new function: shrink_dcache_sb.
Thanks for the feedback
