Well Rusty's point about just using the percpu API seemed
reasonable - that's basically equivalent to statically defining
the data.  In what situation is dynamic allocation needed?
Well, in modules for one.  Unless we work out a way to make the
percpu API work with storage which is defined within modules.

Looks nice.

Stick with the existing format, I'd say.   Numerous applications
would break otherwise.
