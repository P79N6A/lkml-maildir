OK, I have a theory.
This must have been the seventeenth damn time I've stared at
find_next_zero_bit() wondering what the damn return value is and wondering
how any even slightly non-sadistic person could write a damn function like
that and not damn well document it.
int find_next_zero_bit(const unsigned long *addr, int size, int offset)
It returns the offset of the first zero bit relative to addr.  
ext3's bitmap_search_next_usable_block() assumed that find_next_zero_bit()
returns the offset of the first zero bit relative to (addr+offset).
The while loop in ext3's bitmap_search_next_usable_block() serendipitously
covered that bug up.
ext2's bitmap_search_next_usable_block() doesn't need that while loop, so
ext3's benign bug became ext2's fatal bug.
So...

Anyway, I think that's the bug.  Or a bug, at least.  If so, the cause of
this bug is inadequate code commenting, pure and simple.  And ext3 and ext4
need fixing.
