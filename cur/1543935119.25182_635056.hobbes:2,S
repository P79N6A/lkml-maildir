Can you try 2.6.24-rc7 + the IOMMU changes?
The patches are available at:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/tomo/iommu/
Or if you prefer the git tree:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tomo/linux-2.6-misc.git iommu-sg-fixes
I've looked at the changes to GART but they are straightforward and
don't look wrong...
Thanks,
