Why is it useless?  It sounds useful to me, on first glance.  If I want
to run a user-level network daemon I don't trust (for instance, fingerd),
isolating it in a chroot area sounds pretty nice: If there is a buffer
overrun in the daemon, you can get some protection [*] against the rest
of your system being trashed.  Am I missing something obvious?
[*] Yes, I know chroot is not sufficient on its own to completely
    protect against this, but it is a useful part of the puzzle, and
    there are other things we can do to deal with the remaining holes.
