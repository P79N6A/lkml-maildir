I got a 1505AE and a 2940UW. I got the 1505AE to work with 0x140 and IRQ
9. So far no problem under 2.0.36.
Since I switched to Kernel 2.2.1 I am experiencing the following
problem:
One of the HDs attached to the 2940UW (a Quantum Viking II, sync. at
40MB/s) powers down from time to time (the SCSI-bus is reset) due to a
data overrun.
Might this be a problem relating to the coexistence of the 1505 or is
this just a problem of the AIC7xxx-driver? If this is a driver problem,
is this problem solved with the new AC4 release?
