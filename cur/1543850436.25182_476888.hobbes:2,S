There seems to be lot of confusion here. Current code isn't using hpet 
as tick source if legacy is not supported. This patch adds 
hpet_lrr_force but it's not clear how it interacts with hpet_use_timer - 
in some places it is hpet_use_timer and some (hpet_use_timer && 
hpet_lrr_force).
The timer is routed to ioapic pin 2 which is irq0 with source override. 
With this patch with hpet_lrr_force=1 timer irq is set to 2 for x86_64 
and 0 for i386, that can't be right?
