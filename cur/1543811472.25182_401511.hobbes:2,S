Yes, thats  the reason why we didn't do the on-demand allocation...the 
next time a task is checked
could be in any of the places where the timestamping is done. Doing the 
allocation there (and incurring
the extra cost of the check even when sysctl hasn't been used) didn't 
seem worthwhile, esp. when we
have a point (sysctl handler) where we can catch most of the allocs needed.
But if task enumeration is going to get more difficult, we'll need to 
keep the on-demand allocation (on
next use) as a backup for tasks that weren't caught during the sysctl 
change.
