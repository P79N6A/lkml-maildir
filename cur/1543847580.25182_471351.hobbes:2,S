I can reproduce it within a few hours of stressing, but only
on that one box.  I've not figured out exactly what's so
special about it yet (though the 1k block thing may be it).
I had been thinking it was a raid0 only thing, as none of
my other boxes have that.
I'm not entirely sure how it got set up that way either.
The Fedora installer being too smart for its own good perhaps.
