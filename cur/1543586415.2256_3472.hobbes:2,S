I think the tools should not dig too much information out of the system.
I remember some Microsoft (win98 beta?) bugtracking software that
insisted on sending a several hundert kB long compressed blob with every
bug report.
IMHO it must be possible to file bugreports without the complete hw info
if I know that the bug isn't hw related.
