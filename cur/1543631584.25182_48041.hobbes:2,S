Hi!
I have several questions about asm/timex.h
1) Who uses it? The kernel certainly doesn't. Perhaps NTP?
2) CLOCK_TICK_RATE is defined on i386 and similar archs
   to be 1193180. This is wrong, because the real frequency
   of the i8253 PIT timer is 14.31818 MHz / 12 = 1.11931816 MHz,
   so CLOCK_TICK_RATE should be 1193182. Should it be fixed?
3) What if an architecture doesn't have a compile-time known
   CLOCK_TICK_RATE? I suppose I cannot just #define it to a variable,
   because the kernel doesn't use it, and that probably means userland
   does ...
Anyone knows the answers?
