OK, tried it now.  Sorry it took so long to get around to it.
It gets the ATA clock setting right, but that's the only obvious change.  
Everything else in the boot log seems the same.
The UDMA rate is still detected wrongly, but this is because the PCI reg 0x40 
contains the value 0xa000 which should mean 40 wire cables.  I am using 
rounded canbles, but I can't say if this would cause a misdetection or not.  
The ITE driver seems to suggest that cable detect can only be used if the 
chip is in "Firmware" mode.  I thought I saw a more definite reference to 
this, but I can't seem to find it now.  It's certainly true that I have not 
seen any data corruption on the connected drives even when running at hat 
should be UDMA133.
One other small point is that SMART doesn't work through this driver.  
smartctl -A says there is a checksum error and then says SMART is not active.
