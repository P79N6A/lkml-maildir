Subject: [PATCH] Fix security check for joint context= and fscontext= mount options
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/13/313

After some discussion on the actual meaning of the filesystem class
security check in try context mount it was determined that the checks
for the context= mount options were not correct if fscontext mount
option had already been used.  When labeling the superblock we should be
checking relabel_from and relabel_to.  But if the superblock has already
been labeled (with fscontext) then context= is actually labeling the
inodes, and so we should be checking relabel_from and associate.  This
patch fixes which checks are called depending on the mount options.
This is issue is in 2.6.8-rc1-git4 and should probably be fixed before
2.6.18 releases.
