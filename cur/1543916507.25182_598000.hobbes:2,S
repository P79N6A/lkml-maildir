 For anything newer the latch is still there in the chipset; most likely 
in the south bridge and probably actively decoded (irrespective of the 
architecture of the bit behind the north bridge) though it may be possible 
to disable it in a chip-specific manner.  If there is no south bridge in a 
given system, then it is probably safe not to claim the port.
