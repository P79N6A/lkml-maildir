   Here is a more complete listing of the issues found by a
   compiler-based checker after being filtered by me.
Thanks a lot for this.  I've dealt with the core networking cases
caught, and many of the networking drivers (but not all).
I'll send a patch with these fixes to Linus under seperate cover.
(Rusty, I fixed the netfilter cases too)
Later,
