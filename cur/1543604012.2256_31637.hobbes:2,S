   But x86 isn't particularly interesting - it'd be useful to have a 
   flush_dcache_range() which actually works across other architectures anyway.
The memory technology device case is weird, give it a solution
such as "asm/memdev.h".

   So they should probably have less misleading names, perchance including the
   letter 'v' and the letter 'm' somewhere? And they should _certainly_ have
   less misleading documentation. :)
Why?  find_get_page says nothing about "page cache", but people
understand that is what it is used for.
The documention should be more specific, thats all.
Franks a lot,
