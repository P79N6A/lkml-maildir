I habitually scoop up patches and will get them into Linus (preferably
after 1-2 -mm cycles) if he ducks them.

Yup.  And MAINTAINERS has quite a few omissions.  I generally know who
should be poked and if there's nobody obvious I have 26000 patches to grep
through to find out who might know a bit about that code.  Low-level x86 is
a bit of a problem really because it has many cooks and no obvious chef.
Individual maintainers have differing response times, differing
attentiveness and differing patchloss ratios.
There's also confusion once I've cc'ed a maintainer on a patch over whether
I'll be sending it to Linus or whether I want them to.
If a maintainer has a tree in -mm then I'll autodrop the patch if they
merge it, so there's no confusion there.
If the maintainer says "thanks, merged" and I don't have their tree in -mm
then I'll tend to hang onto the patch indefinitely until it finally hits
-linus.  Or I'll eventually forget and merge it up anyway ;) 
If the maintainer just acks the patch I'll send it in to Linus.
If the maintainer nacks the patch I'll either drop it or I'll mark it
not-for-merging and hang onto it anwyay, as a reminder that we have some
bug which needs fixing.
If the maintainer has a tree in -mm and doesn't merge the patch I'll hang
onto it and periodically resend to the maintainer until some definite
response comes back.
