Oops - the version I posted differed in one character from the version 
that I'd compiled - I'd just used "sbb" in the working version and let 
the compiler figure out which version to use.

Yes, that would work too, but I don't like forcing the asm to use 
particular registers when there's no good reason to do so.

It was mainly down to the differences between the i386 and x86_64 
versions, and trying to understand the reasons for those differences, 
and indeed how the entire set of macros worked at all.
