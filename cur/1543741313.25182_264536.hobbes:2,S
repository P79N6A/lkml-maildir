Actually, I picked up -V0.1 since that was available when I started
this morning and of course -V0.2 came out while I was building....
The kernel I built does not even make it to single user mode unless
I disable selinux.
First try had console messages stop after the message
  INIT: version 2.85 booting
but the Alt-Sysrq keys do work. Alt-Sysrq-L shows...
Pid: 5, comm:   ksoftirqd/1
EIP: 0060:[<c011d808>] CPU:1
EIP is at smp_processor_id+0x28/0xc0
(registers and stack trace...)
preempt count: 00010002
...
Pid: 266, comm:   IRQ 1
EIP: 0060:[<c0115b70>] CPU:0
EIP is at nmi_show_all_regs+0xd0/0x120
(registers and stack trace...)
preempt count: 00010002
...
If I repeat this a few times, the first process changed to "hotplug".
Repeating Alt-Sysrq-L will eventually gets stuck and requires
a hardware reset.
Second try - the INIT message was incomplete, stopping at
INIT:
plus the Alt-Sysrq keys not working at all.
Third try - added
  selinux=0
to the boot parameters. Made it single user mode w/o any errors.
Using telinit 3 got me a few BUG messages related to modprobe
and sleeping from an invalid context. From what I read in
other messages, you may have already fixed that so I will be
building -V0.2 shortly.
I also got the atomic counter underflow (qdisc_destroy) message.
Let me know if you need the system log, it appears to have
captured the messages if you need them.
