I have a little more information on this...
I have a (quite) new EPIA MII 12000.
Worked fine on FC3 with 2.6.9. It also worked on 2.6.7.
Have installed KnoppMyth, which comes with 2.6.11.7-chw-4.
All my 2.0 USB ports now list as 1.1, and 2.0 devices plugged
in run at 1.1 speeds.
lspci reports:
    USB Controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT82xxxxx UHCI USB 1.1
Controller (rev 80) (prog-if 00 [UHCI])
    Subsystem: VIA Technologies, Inc.: Unknown device aa01
Hope this helps (and makes it to you).
Paul.
