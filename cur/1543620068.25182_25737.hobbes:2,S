I want these entries to sound like "Hey, I am working on these parts of the 
kernel, if you have something, send it to me not to Linus". With precise 
indication of those parts and your level of involvement:
Vojtech Pavlik <vojtech@ucw.cz> [5 feb 2002]
	Feel free to send me bug reports and patches to input device drivers
	(drivers/input/*, drivers/char/joystick/*) and USB drivers
	(printer, acm, catc, hid*, usbmouse, usbkbd, wacom).
	Also CC me if you are posting VIA IDE driver related message
	(although I am not IDE subsystem maintainer).
Does this look right?
