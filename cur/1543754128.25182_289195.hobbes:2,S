Hi Ingo !
Could you explain me precisely what is the race you are fixing by adding
local_irq_disable() to rest_init() ?
This patch is causing lockups on boot on various ppc machines. I think
i've found at least one possible reason for that in the ppc cpu_idle()
code, which may not re-enable interrupts in some cases when
need_resched() is not set, assuming they were enabled on entry. However,
I'm wondering precisely what exact race you are trying to fix as my fix
would cause IRQs to be re-enabled before the call to schedule() when
need_resched() is not set, which goes against the comment you added to
rest_init() about letting them be re-enable by schedule() itself...
Ben.
