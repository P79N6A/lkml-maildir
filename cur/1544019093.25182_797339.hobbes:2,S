another reason why it's good to run it with preemption disabled is that 
whatever context does show_regs() ought to be non-preemptible as it deals 
with CPU local details.
In the fatal-signals case we indeed have a "it does not really matter" 
boundary case, but in most of the other uses we want to be non-preemptible 
in debug contexts, and want a constant reminder in terms of 
smp_processor_id() warnings if that expectation is not met.
