I realized that bug as I was doing cpuset conversion.
Basically, we can't use just tsk->nsproxy to find what tasks are in
a directory (/mnt/B for ex). Here's what I was think we should be doing instead:
struct nsproxy *ns;
void *data;
ns = dentry_of(/mnt/B/tasks)->d_parent->d_fsdata;
data = ns->ctlr_data[some subsystem id which is bound in /mnt/B hierarchy]
we now scan tasklist and find a match if:
	tsk->nsproxy->ctlr_data[the above id] == data
(maybe we need to match on all data from all subsystems bound to B)
There is a similar bug in rcfs_rmdir also. We can't just use the nsproxy
pointed to by dentry to know whether the resource objects are free or
not. I am thinking (if at all resource control has to be provided on top
of nsproxy) that we should have a get_res_ns, similar to get_mnt_ns or
get_uts_ns, which will track number of nsproxies pointing to the same
resource object. If we do that, then rmdir() needs to go and check
those resource object's refcounts to see if a dir is in use or not.
