Hi,
My working IDE tree (against Linus' tree) now resides here:
	
http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/bart/pata-2.6/patches/
and is managed by quilt.
Currently it contains the following changes:
* all IDE patches from 2.6.20-rc3-mm1
  (great work done by Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>)
* atiixp fixes [in -mm already]
  (from Conke Hu <conke.hu@amd.com>)
* pci/generic update for jmicron [in -mm already]
  (from Alan Cox <alan@redhat.com>) 
* new IT8213 driver
  (from Jack Lee <Jack.Lee@ite.com.tw> and Alan Cox, some fixes by me)
* add pci_get_legacy_ide_irq() to ia64 [fixes amd74xx build] (by me)
* add missing __init tags to IDE PCI host drivers (by me)
* bunch of cleanups (by me)

 51 files changed, 1918 insertions(+), 1498 deletions(-)
I'm sending only new patches for review/comments.
If you would like to see the full quilt series (or to get combined patch)
against 2.6.20-rc3-mm1 / 2.6.20-rc4, they are available here:
