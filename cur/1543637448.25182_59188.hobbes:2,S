Well...I *would* *not* mind patches from Andre.
Hell, I would take patches even from Saddam personally if they where
looking OK. And I look from time to time at the 2.4.xx tree. But I don't
look at the pre ac or whatever releases. Let them settle out
first :-) And last but not least most of the sorting out for particular 
host controller register tweaking is done by others not me...
 From Andre I only saw a single patch once a long long time ago
attached to full load of the usual personal insults.
It didn't even apply cleanly to the kernel tree it was supposed to apply 
too and it was "obviously" not correct as well.
Saddm, on the other side, apparently doesn't do Linux developement.
But Jamie Zawinski is still alive at least :-).
