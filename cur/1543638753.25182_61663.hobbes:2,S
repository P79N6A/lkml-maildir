That looks good. In the 2.5.x kernel I've already worked around this
bug by increasing the socket buffer size. However the problem isn't
just limited to NFS.
Concerning the 2.4.x kernel: it would be very nice if this fix made it
into 2.4.19, as the bug has already been known to crash a few
servers...
Cheers,
