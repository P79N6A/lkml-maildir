thanks for the testcase! It indeed triggered a bug in the -rt tree's 
"RT-overload" balancing feature. The nature of the bug made it trigger 
much less likely on 2-way boxes (where i do most of my -rt testing), 
probably that's why it didnt get discovered before. I've uploaded the 
-rt14 tree with this bug fixed - does it fix the failures for you?
