I don't think it non-intuitive, it's how libraries work. However, as you 
say, it is broken for files containing EXPORT_SYMBOL.
The obvious fix for this case is the one that akpm mentioned way earlier 
in this thread, move parser.o into $(obj-y).
It should be rather easy to have the kernel build system warn you when you 
compile library objects exporting symbols.
