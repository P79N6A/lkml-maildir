LOL... Hm... Well, I'll say this, I took a zip drive to school (I'm in
High School) and I downloaded kernel 2.3.3, patches to 2.3.5, and kernel
2.2.9.  None of them were filtered by BESS :).
However, Slashdot is and I'm currently contesting that... :)
Anyway, the software is reliable, it works for me and many others.
Therefore, that justifies any so-called wrongdoing in the writing of
profanity in the kernel.  Big deal.  :)
