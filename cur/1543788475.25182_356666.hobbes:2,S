Any tip on which version to try first, i.e. when were potentially
problematic patches merged? Keep in mind that it can take several days
to trigger the problem (resume always works on a freshly booted system),
so systematically testing everything (even as a binary search) isn't
really an option. Maybe there a way to recover some information about
what exactly went wrong?
