Hi all,
What is  the first code the new born child process run after it is 
forked by the system call and being schduled into the CPU to run ? what 
i concerned is , kernel will schdule once when leaving the system call 
for returning father process, will kernel schdule once again when 
leaving the systemcall for child process if the child process return 
code is inside the kernel space?
Hope someone can answer me.
TOM
