Going even further in this direction, the following POSIX ACL on the  
directories will do what you want:
## Note: file owner and group are kmoffett
u::rw-
g::rw-
u:lsorens:rw-
u:mtharp:rw-
u:mperkel:rw-
g:randomcvsdudes:r-
default:u::rw-
default:g::rw-
default:u:lsorens
default:u:mtharp:rw-
default:u:mperkel:rw-
default:g:randomcvsdudes:r-
Basically any newly-created item in such a directory will get the  
permissions described by the "default:" entries in the ACL, and  
subdirectories will get a copy of said "default:" entries.
So yes, such functionality is nice; even more so because we already  
have it.  I think if you were really going to "extend" a UNIX  
filesystem it would need to be in 2 directions:
   (A)  Handling disk failures by keeping multiple copies of  
important files.
   (B)  Have version-control support
   (C)  Allowing distributed storage (also lazy synchronization and  
offline modification support)
With some appropriate modifications and hooks, GIT actually comes  
pretty close here.  For larger files it needs to use a "list-of-4MB- 
chunks" approach to minimize the computation overhead for committing  
a randomly-modified file.  The "index" of course would be directly  
read and modified by vfs calls and via mapped memory.  Merge handling  
would need careful integration, preferably with allowing custom  
default-merge-handlers per subtree.  There would be lots more design  
issues to work out, but it's something to think about
Cheers,
