Unfortunately I do not think this is going to work well in in default case:
1. PS/2 probing order is important. You need to probe for intellimouse
   explorer last otherwise you might miss that mouse supports extended
   protocol.
2. Synaptics hardware has to be probed even if synaptics protocol is not
   used, otherwise intellimouse probe will case trackpoint on passthrough
   port not working.
3. Doing full reset after every protocol probe will cause long delays in
   mouse detection. 
4. Maxproto is still needed - psmouse base still contains several protocols
   and sometimes users need to force "standard" protocols (Intellimouse/
   Explorer), for example when using a KVM switch.
Also, splitting psmouse into several modules as opposed to having monolitic
psmouse with an option to exclude some protocols via Kconfig does not really
buy us anything - because protocol autoload is not possible (we do not know
what protocols port uses until we actually do the probe) distributions will
have to compile and load everything anyway. Custom kernel users will just
have to compile protocols they need into psmouse.
And some comments for the patch itself:

I think you wanted if (set_properties)...

This is going to crash if you encounter unconnected port
(serio->drv == NULL).

You need to be careful with code attribution - for example Synaptics driver
was written by Peter Osterlund. He took some code from tpconfig utility,
that's why there is C. Scott Ananian copyright notice but _module_ author
is still Peter.

Hmm, does this compile?
