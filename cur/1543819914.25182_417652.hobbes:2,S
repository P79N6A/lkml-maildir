It was not good explanation. Let me restate that.
The effect of shortening timeslice is to let the task be expired soon
by shortening
its remainder timeclice, so it still works even if the task consome very small
timeslice at one time. However, expired TASK_INTERACTIVE tasks will be requeued
to the active for a while by the scheduler, so shortening timeslice
doesn't work well for
TASK_INTERACTIVE tasks.
