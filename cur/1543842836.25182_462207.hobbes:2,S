I wrote my own patch to test this last Friday.  I found that removing all the
regs pointer passing from the interrupt code reduced interrupt entry with a
warm cache by 1 cpu cycle out of 87, and interrupt exit by 19 cycles out of 99.
I can't tell from that exactly how many instructions/memory accesses have been
removed since the FRV permits two instructions to be executed in one cycle
under some circumstances, and two registers to be stored/loaded in one
instruction.
But the main gain in the exit path has to be due to recovery of the clobbered
regs parameter due to a call inside a loop, possibly in handle_IRQ_event().
I'd expect i386 to do better in cycle reduction because it has fewer registers
and so getting one back should gain more.
