A small nitpick about the way ou build the ekrnel module:
In mk_and_insmod you can replace:
make -C /usr/src/linux SUBDIRS=$PWD modules
with
LIBDIR=/lib/modules/`uname -r`
make -C $LIBDIR/source O=$LIBDIR/build SUBDIRS=`pwd` modules
For a normal kernel installation this will do the right thing.
source points to the kernel source and build point to the output
directory (they are often equal but not always).
$PWD is supplied by the shell, so it is better to use `pwd`.
