I wish. devfs is something I've had to track for a while now, since it
didn't make it in before 2.2.

The same way your scheme did. Keep in mind, the idea with devfs is to
eliminate the old /dev/hdX naming scheme, and replace it with something
more sensible (much like your idea was shooting for).

Even under your proposal, the old 'hdXY' names had to be modified. To get
what you want, you're going to have to break backwards compatibility. Or,
more accurately, to do it -well-, you'll end up breaking backwards
compatibility.
But, devfs provides a mode where the old names are exported to /dev for
intermediary compatibility. Hence, once your system software had been
modified to recognize the new naming convention correctly, you can
eliminate the compatibility symlinks.
