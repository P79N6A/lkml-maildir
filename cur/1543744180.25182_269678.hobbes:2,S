 Because you are trying to use the region in the I/O port space.  That's
probably not what you want to do and an 8-bit ISA board cannot decode it
at all anyway.  Actually for some platforms using the I/O space outside
the low 16-bit range may be quite difficult even for buses and devices
that support it and Linux does not support it then, either.  So Linux 
correctly informs you you cannot use that range.

 Try check_mem_region() instead, ...

 ... or better yet request_mem_region()/release_resource(), as the former 
is deprecated and will be removed.
