   Just have compiled 2.4.0-test8 today...
   Nothing interesting
   Everything goes the same way as 2 test releases before...
   All my devices are detected right, but... :-(
   Kernel panic again at the file systems mounting point.
   Final error message, as I remember it, sounds like:
   Error reading sector 0...  21:41 dev hdf1
   or something like that
Can you send your bug report again with the exact error message?  One of
the most dreaded words in a bug report is "or something like that".
All kernel messages relating to the IDE device driver would also be
useful.
