I don't mind either way.  But I just looked, and I think they are doing
different things.  If I'm reading the XFS bits right, the XFS ioctls
actively reserve/free disk space; but the ext3 ones do nothing except
set/query the size of the per-inode sliding reservation window.
So sounds like they are best kept separate for now.
Cheers,
 Stephen
