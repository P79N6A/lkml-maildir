*For* *those* *systems*.
Until 99% of the Linux machines are Agendas, or whatever, and 1% PC's, as
opposed to the other way around, we should default to displaying basic[1]
info about the driver, unless told to with a "verbose" option or somesuch,
which would make it spew verbose stuff[2]. And then a "debug" option which
would make it spew lots and lots of stuff[3]. All of this specifiable on the
commandline. (Can you currently change the default loglevel on the kernel
commandline?).
I honestly feel that this is the best idea. Just because we do this by
default doesn't mean that the people who make embedded systems can't modify
the kernel, or hell, even just the bootflags, to do what they want.
