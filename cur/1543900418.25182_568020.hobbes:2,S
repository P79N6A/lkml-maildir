Sure, but before we go out and buy a new car, let's figure out properly what 
the problems with the old one are. It might just be that the horrendous sound 
that's making us want a new car isn't as bad as we initially think. Even if 
we do decide we want a new version, we can at least learn something from the 
old one.
