Indeed. Same exact thing, different bit.
It could easily be a wild pointer corruption - single-bit errors in RAM
are not entirely uncommon (and as Al points out, they usually end up
showing up in things like the dcache which can have long lists that are
traversed fairly infrequently).
But blaming the thing on bad RAM is not a good strategy if there are many
of these reports. I'd love to see more of a pattern, though, because
without a pattern there is nothing to really start from..
The pattern might be something as simple as "we're both using minixfs"
or whatever.
