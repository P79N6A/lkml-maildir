How does the current setup avoid this problem? If someone's answering
ARPs for your IP, you're not going to get far. 
This is a long-standing problem with almost all of the TCP protocols -
they assume trusted network administrators. Of course these days anyone
with a cable modem and a PC is a "network administrator" :-(
