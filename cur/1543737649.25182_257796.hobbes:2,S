Subject: High Resolution Timer patches crash with slower DDR memory?

Does it make sense to anyone that when I run a 2.6.8.1 system patched with HRT using 2 sticks of PC3200 DDR memory (512Meg total) it
works fine, but when I add a stick of PC2700 DDR memory (3 sticks total to 1024Meg) it throws kernel panics and page fault errors?
Same system running an unpatched kernel has no problems.
