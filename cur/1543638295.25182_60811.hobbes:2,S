Yeah - with partition boundaries set not on a physical sector boundary ;-/
He's actually lucky that beginning of partition was not in the middle of
a physical sector...
Looks like we need
	a) accurate hardsect_size for these beasts (which is a problem
with current setup, since it's per-queue and not per-device; master and
slave can have different hardsect sizes).
	b) extra check in check_partitions() that would verify that
partition doesn't end in the middle of a sector (and round it down
if it does).
Basically, old code worked by accident on that setup - Petr had half-Kb
in the end of partition unaccessible and do_open() didn't notice that.
Now it does and tries to give such access.  Disk is not happy...
