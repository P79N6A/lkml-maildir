I2O, as seen from the PCI/Bus, is a bus! Right? You have a
PCI/Bus controller that provides for an interface into
I2O? Right? Can you do `cat /proc/pci` and show what device
you think it is?  I think you are attempting to access a bridge
or something. I2O is supposed to be intelligent and to grab
64 megabytes of host address space is the anthesis of this.
