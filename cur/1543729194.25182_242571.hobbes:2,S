Some of the metadata handling is needed kernel side. I'm hoping we can
avoid most of it with the drive hotplug code. The corner case causing
the problem is when no arrays are configured so there is no device/hwif
present.
I looked at the libata stuff - it's part of the reason I sent Jeff the
error dump/translate patch but right now libata is woefully ignorant of
a large number of IDE/EIDE/ATA considerations.
