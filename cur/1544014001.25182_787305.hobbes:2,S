I see, thanks.

Yes.  And it does not mean the bad descriptor is at head of the active
queue.
1) driver enqueue desc A to active list and start DMA engine
2) driver enqueue desc B to queue list
3) driver enqueue desc C to queue list  (desc C contains bad address)
4) DMA engine finish desc A and raise interrupt
5) tasklet remove desc A from active list and move desc B and C to active list
6) DMA engine finish desc B and raise interrupt
7) DMA engine abort desc C and raise interrupt
8) tasklet detect error
The point is the order of (7) and (8) cannot be expected.  If (7)
comes first, the head of the active list contains desc B at (8) and
that is not a bad descriptor.
