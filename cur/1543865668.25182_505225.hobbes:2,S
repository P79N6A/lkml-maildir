Clean boot for me on ARM ixp4xx (gcc-4.1.1, glibc-2.5, big endian, 
softfloat).
High-res timers looks good.
However, I'm trying to use PI mutexes in userspace 
(pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol =>
PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT) and found strange behaviour. It seems to me that 
mutex
is not really locked, ie. first thread locks mutex then second thread also 
locks the
same mutex! Then the second mutex unlock it and when the first thread 
unlocks the
mutex error EPERM is returned.
What do you think, is it kernel or glibc problem? (Priority ceiling works 
as expected.)
Is PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT supposed to work on my platform?
If there is anything else what would you like to see from my system, let 
me know.
See logs from pi_tests-1.15 => classic_pi.c (I added code that test return 
value from
pthread_mutex_lock/pthread_mutex_unlock):
