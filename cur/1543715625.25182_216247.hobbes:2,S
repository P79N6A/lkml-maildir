Hi Len,
 just to make things clear: I never talked about 2.4.25 :-) I went
directly from 2.4.23 to 2.4.26. And ACPI was not set in my 2.4.23
config. Not sure how it got set in 2.4.26? Interesting ...
 Anyway, I killed acpid and did a cat on the event stream. All I see
is:
# cat /proc/acpi/event

 During this snapshot, the number of ACPI interrupts went up by about
270. So, it seems not every ACPI interrupt ends in /proc/acpi/event.
 In general, the whole thing is pretty hard to reproduce. It seems to
be also depenant on the system load. The keyboard double-hit is much
more likely to happen when running a kernel compile instead of an
otherwise idle system.

 Nope, no such messages in dmesg.

 On my system it looks like this:
# cat /proc/acpi/processor/CPU0/power
active state:            C2
default state:           C1
bus master activity:     00000000
states:
    C1:                  promotion[C2] demotion[--] latency[000]
usage[00012170]
   *C2:                  promotion[--] demotion[C1] latency[010]
usage[00888388]
    C3:                  <not supported>
