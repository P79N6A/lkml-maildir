Subject: [PATCH 0/5] sysfs backing store (Re-splitted)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hello Andrew,
As per Viro's suggestions I have re-splitted the sysfs backing store 
patch set. This splitting is more meaningful and it should make the 
long pending review more interesting. There are no significant changes 
in the code except some cosmetic code re-arrangement and a couple of 
real changes in the error paths.
1) In fs/sysfs/dir.c:create_dir(), dput() was missing if we fail in
   sysfs_new_dirent()
2) Check for kmalloc() return value in fs/sysfs/symlink.c:sysfs_add_link().
I hope Viro will do the review soon. In the mean time I thought it will be 
nice if you could _replace_ the sysfs patches (six patches with names 
sysfs-leaves-xxx.patch) with the following patches (mailed separately). 
I will update them again based on the comments I get. 
Thanks
Maneesh
