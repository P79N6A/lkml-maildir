Hi,
Linux-2.4.0-test12 doesn't boot on VAIO PCG-N505SN,
whereas linux-2.2.10 works fine (both booted by lilo-21).
It just hangs after printing:
Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.
HANG
Btw. Raw bzImage booted over USB-floppy just reboots...
Can this be infamous A20 again ?
Regards, Gunther
