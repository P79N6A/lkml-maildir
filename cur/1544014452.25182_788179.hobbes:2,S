Well - here the check is: "if (not MSI or MSIX)" in essence. I thought 
that it might be confusing to call it _msi() as well, so we could approach 
it via the inverse space: general system interrupts (GSIs) - which are 
device irqs that are neither MSI nor MSIX.
But if pci_has_msi_irq() can cleanly include the MSIX portion too, that's 
fine too. (MSI-X is really MSI with wider eventing capabilities but 
otherwise non-GSI just as much - and we dont want to enable (or even 
touch) the legacy IRQ line registers for any of them, even if they happen 
to be enumerated)
Right?
