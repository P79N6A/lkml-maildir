Absolutely NO ! it is not "keeping the port open", it is "keeping a SESSION
open". The firewall should allow traffic from the same ip:port to the other
ip:port and from no other server on the net. You new session is totally
unrelated to the old one.

it is not the same session if you connect to a different remote server,
and there is absolutely no reason to arbitrary prevent an internal server
from connecting to two external ones from the same IP:port. Of course, if
you reconnect to the same destIP:port, it should work because in this case
it is a continuation of the same session.

it is not the timing which causes trouble, it is the way it confuses new
and already established sessions. Although 60 ms may seem short (you can
probably never resolve anything on ADSL with a loaded link), it may be
perfectly valid if the firewall agrees to open several sessions when you
connect to several servers. And if you connect several times to the same
server, of course it must re-open the session.

unfortunately, googling for "pix udp problem" returns 25600 responses...
