Hi!
When I try to use the following program I get a SEGV fault.  Why is this?
I thought reading a value from control registers isn't supposed to
generate an exception.
int
main ()
{
	unsigned long fa;
	asm ("movl %%cr2, %0": "=r" (fa));
	return 0;
}
Thanks in advance.
P.S.  I suppose this is not actually the right list to ask this but I
couldn't think of a better one.
