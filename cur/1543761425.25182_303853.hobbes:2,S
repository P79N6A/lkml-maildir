    Thanks for all the help in the past, and I'm once again knocking
    at your door for more help.
    I am trying to get my PCI bus device driver running on an Xeon 
    64-bit FC-3 distribution.
    I got the compiler warnings all cleaned up, the driver compiles and 
    loads, but the test executable which was compiled on a 32-bit FC-3 
    distribution is causing these messages in /var/log/messages:
	Mar 17 15:42:55 noble kernel: ioctl32(boardtest:3730): 
	Unknown cmd fd(3) cmd(8004440e){00} arg(ffffd824) on /dev/sse0
	Mar 17 15:42:55 noble kernel: ioctl32(boardtest:3730): 
	Unknown cmd fd(3) cmd(8004440e){00} arg(ffffd8c4) on /dev/sse0
	Mar 17 15:42:55 noble kernel: ioctl32(boardtest:3730): 
	Unknown cmd fd(3) cmd(40044414){00} arg(00000000) on /dev/sse0
	Mar 17 15:42:55 noble kernel: ioctl32(boardtest:3730): 
	Unknown cmd fd(3) cmd(80044403){00} arg(0804f780) on /dev/sse0
    It's probably a simple thing to change my ioctl() interface in the
    driver, but I googled myself blue in the face, and I didn't find it,
    so I come to you, hat-in-hand for help.
    Where can I find out how to change my driver so I can have a 32-bit
    executable talk to it using ioctl()?
    I did change the "type" argument in _IOR and _IOW to uint32_t from
    int, but that didn't change things.
