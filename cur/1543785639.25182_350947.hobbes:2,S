My feelings as well when I get random serial bugs in bugzilla for drivers
I have zero clue about and no one to assign them to. 8/

Broadly, it's:
arch/arm/*
drivers/*/arm
drivers/mfd/*		(this fits at the moment, but whether it will in
			 the future depends what else appears there.)
drivers/mmc/*
drivers/serial*		(though only the drivers in there actually using
			 serial_core - unfortunately some non-serial_core
			 drivers appear to have been placed in there.)
include/asm-arm/*
include/linux/8250*
include/linux/serial*
fs/adfs/*
but there are various drivers authored by myself which I'd obviously be
interested in CC'ed.
