Can one rely on argv and env being contigous memory area? Getting it another
way - can the proposed patch be applied with no side effects? Sendmail's
setproctitle does work the a.m. way, i.e. it uses the environment space in
addition to the argument space so it looks like a right way to set a proc

What was the reason behind making such a change? It could be simply an
overlooked typo, but it could also be done for some good reason. Can
somebody enlighten me? It have to be fixed if it IS a typo. And it looks
like a typo, 'coz we have to fix helluva lotta programs which do use
setproctitle if it is not. Falling back to the old kernel behaviour would
be much less pain then fixing all the applications that use to change their
argv for ps...
