I haven't tested O(1) together with lock-break personally, yet, but I
have a confirmation of success from a couple of users.  There are no
reasons it shouldn't work.

Again I don't have any personal tests.  I do know, however, the Rik's
rmap VM works great.
I suspect Andrea's updated VM from -aa will work, but there may be other
parts of his patch (RCU) that are not preempt friendly.

A good test.
