I understand what you are saying, I just hadnt expected the system
to grab quite so much space.  After all there is only a video card
(Radeon 9600) and a sound card (Sound Blaster Live!) plugged into
the bus.
Im sure that the sound card doesnt use all that much space, but I
find it hard to believe that the video card is grabbing ALL of that space.
Possibly grabbing space at too low an address, but that should be correctable.
I had expected to loose some space, just not as much as is missing.
And this board does like paired memory cards, so perhaps the solution
would be 2x 1GB and 2x 500MB.
