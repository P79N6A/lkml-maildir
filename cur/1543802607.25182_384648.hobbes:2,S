Subject: [Patch 0/2]Memory hotplug from ACPI container driver take 2.

Hello.
I would like to post patches for ACPI memory hotplug again.
These are necessary when container driver, which is a kind of block
like NUMA node, calls memory hotplug.
If a node is hot-added, notification from ACPI reaches to container 
device, and container device driver will try to add and start
each devices which are included on the node by acpi_bus_add() and
acpi_bus_start(). 
But current acpi_memhotplug.c is just for the case that notification
reaches to memory device directly. So, add_memory() is just called by
notify handler of memory device.
If node is hot-added, contaner driver calls only acpi_memory_device_add()
to register "struct acpi_memory_device". But there is no start function
for memory, so add_memory() is not called.
I think that add_memory() should be called at acpi_bus_start() for
NUMA node case. These are patches for it.
These patches are for 2.6.15. And, I tested on my Tiger 4
 with Numa emulation by Custom DSDT.
Please apply.
Thanks.
