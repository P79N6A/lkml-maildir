Sure. In my case I need to emulate NUMA nodes to do some NUMA specific
testing. The memory controller I've written has some interesting data
structures like per node, per zone LRU lists. To be able to test those
features on a non-numa box is a problem, since we get just the default node.
To be able to test the memory controller under NUMA, I use fake NUMA
nodes. x86-64 has a similar feature, the code I have here is the
simplest I could come up with for PowerPC.
I just thought of another very interesting use case, it can be used to
split up the zone's lru lock which is highly contended.
