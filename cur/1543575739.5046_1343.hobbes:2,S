Ok.
It definitely looks like a swapoff() problem.
Have you ever seen the behaviour without running swapoff?
Also, can you re-create it without running swapon() (if it's something
like a lost dirty bit, it should be possible to trigger even without the
swapon, and I'd like to hear if that can happen - if it only happens with
swapon() and you can't trigger it with just a swapoff() it might be a
question of re-using some swap file stuff and delaying the writeout or
whatever).
