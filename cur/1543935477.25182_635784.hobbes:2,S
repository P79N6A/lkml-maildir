i dont understand what's confusing.  the Blackfin on chip host controller only 
supports 1-bit MMC, but it supports 4-bit SD/SDIO.  this is a fact.  while it 
may be a stupid decision, it is what it is, and i need the framework made 
more flexible in order to get the Blackfin driver merged cleanly.  we do 
software for hardware, we dont do hardware.
