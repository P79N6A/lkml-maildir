Like Linus said, it's a statistical problem: An unofficial kernel would never 
get the same attention as a released one. We would keep seeing problems arise 
once the kernel has been released. 
One thing we could do, was to do the same as the vendors do, and maintain a 
-post kernel with the most glaring bug-fixed, especially build-ones. 
The need to do it however is not that big..
