Ok,
1. I installed the new harddisk (about february, kernel 2.2.14)
2. I enabled the IDE port in the BIOS and set UDMA to "auto"
3. I compiled a new kernel with the IDE-patches and
   CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEPCI
   CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA
   CONFIG_IDEDMA_AUTO
   CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SIS5513
4. During rebooting I got lots of error messages (as it seems they didn´t
   find their way into the logfile), and the driver switched off DMA and
   used PIO.
5. I switched off UDMA in the BIOS and booted Linux. Since then everything
   works fine.
