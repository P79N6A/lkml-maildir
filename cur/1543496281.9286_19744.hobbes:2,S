__global_cli() cannot stop the other processors if it is called with
interrupts disabled.

I've added a check for that event (__global_cli() called with IF
cleared), and this happens often.
Do we have to fix that? (i.e. convert the callers from __global_cli() to
a spinlock?)
I've found one codpath:
-> ide_end_request(): acquires io_request_lock, clear local interrupts.
-> calls end_that_request_first()
-> calls end_buffer_io_async() <<<<<<<<<< calls cli(), needs global
sync.
