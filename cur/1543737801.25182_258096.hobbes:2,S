Ok. Now that I can implement my iptables plugin I need either:
1) A new event: something like "went idle". Which would be sent from the 
class_device kobject of related network interface.
or
2) I could use the class interface system to add an kobject (instead of 
writing a new class) for each network devices class_device. But to 
accomplish this I have to be able to register interfaces with net_class 
defined net-sysfs.c. See applied patch. It's provides similar functions 
as scsi layer (see scsi_register_interface).
Which one would be better choice? At least the option #2 is general 
purpose and some others might find it useful too. To whom/where I should 
send it?
