Currently we waste a lot of screen on right side, which is not much 
different. Further there is now a mix of left aligned and centered output, 
which is ugly, so this patch only restores the old behaviour (without the 
jumping around for small text changes).

If these longer prompts don't fit into a 80 coloumn window, it's a bug.
