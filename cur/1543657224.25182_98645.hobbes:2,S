Well, there isn't any :o) That's why there's a user-level implementation
for such a beast for those who do need it.

Some guy contacted me about audio-entropyd and told me he'd done a lot
of analysis on all how this and gave me a few hints how to improve the
quality of what is produced with this tool. A quick fourier-
transformation doesn't really show any peaks.
