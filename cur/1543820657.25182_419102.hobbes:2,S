Another CPU may find the bit clear, enter the critical section,
and load the old `likeliness_head' (value before being changed
by this CPU).
Then it stores the old value to likeliness->next, and overwrites
likeliness_head.
One CPU's update has now gotten lost.
(there are probably other examples, like missing likliness->type)
