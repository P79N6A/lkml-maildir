This is a completely harmless message. It is triggered by Solaris
clients trying to test for their proprietary ACL code.

This just means that the RPC layer is congested for some reason:
Either the network is too slow, and some requests are timing out
because they can't get shovelled out in time, or you have noise
causing blockage.
Use tcpdump on both client and server in order to determine whether or
not the client is sending out requests, and whether the server is
replying to them (each and every request should normally be receiving
a reply if all is well).
Cheers,
