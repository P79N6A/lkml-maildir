And the sad part is that I keep reading this crap.  It's like being sick
at home one day and getting stuck on a bad soap opera.  You know the stuff
you're watching is garbage, but you just can't get away and stop watching
it.
At least if it moved to another list I'd be strong enough not to
subscribe. :-)
