Subject: Linux Kernel bug report (includes fix)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-	Linux Kernel include files (starting with Linux-2.5) are buggy and 
	prevent compilation. Many files may be affected but let me name
	the most important files for me:
	-	/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h depends on a nonexistant
		type "u8". The correct way to fix this would be to replace
		any "u8" by "uint8_t". A quick and dirty fix is to call:
			"change u8 __u8 /usr/src/linux/include/scsi/scsi.h"
		
ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/change/
	-	/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/sg.h includes "extra text" "__user"
		in some structure definitions. This may be fixed by adding
		#include <linux/compiler.h> somewhere at the beginning of
		/usr/src/linux/include/scsi/sg.h
	This bug has been reported several times (starting with Linux-2.5).
	Time to fix: 5 minutes.
I did spend far to much time with the discussion on LKML..... so I need a cue
whether it makes sense to continue this discussion.
You now again have the bug report _and_ the fix in a single short mail.
If the bug mentioned above is not fixed in Linux-2.6.8, I will asume that it 
makes no sense to spend further time in discussions with LKML.
Best regards
Jörg
