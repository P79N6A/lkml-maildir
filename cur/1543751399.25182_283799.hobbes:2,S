If I recollect a recent thread on LKML correctly, your 'no inherent need for 
swap' might be wrong.
I think the gist was this: the kernel can sometimes needs to move bits of 
memory in order to free up dma-able ram, or lowmem. If I recall correctly, 
the kernel can only do this move via swap, even if there is stacks of free 
(non-dmaable or highmem) memory.
I distinctly remember the moral of the thread being "Always mount some swap, 
if you can"
This might have changed though, or I might have got it completely wrong. - 
I've cc'ed LKML incase somebody more knowledgeable can comment...
