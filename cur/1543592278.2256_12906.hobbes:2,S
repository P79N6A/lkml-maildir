It's definitely useful, since it lets us keep tabs on what types of bugs
people actually fix ;-)  The tool keeps track of the bugs/false positives we
find, so that it can say when we find something new.

Is the general way to fix these too-large stack vars to heap allocate
them?  Or is it preferable to put a "static" in front of them, if the
routine is non-reentrant?
