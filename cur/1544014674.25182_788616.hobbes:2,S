Subject: [PATCH 0/3] document sysrq interaction with loglevels V2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

[Updated patch series incorporating feedback from Martin Mares and Randy
Dunlap.]
Following on from our discussion on sysrq and its interaction with
console loglevels here are some documentation updates, both to the
Documenation/sysrq.txt as well as to the source, to clarify how things
work and why.
Following this email are three patches.  The first simply removes a
redundant 'last modified date' within the documentation file, git does
this far better.  The second adds a new documentation section indicating
why you might only see the header of the sysrq command you have requested.
The last adds a comment to the console_loglevel modifications within the
sysrq code paths explaining why we might do this.
Andrew please consider for -mm.
