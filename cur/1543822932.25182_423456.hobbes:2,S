There's a multitude of ways how you can misconfigure your -rt system :)
Tell us more about your setup. Hardware? Full preemption? High
resolution timers? Priority setup? From your code i see you run at prio
98. What about the IRQ handlers? And the softirq's, too? Other software?
Flo
P.S.: I ran the test a few [20 or so] times and didn't get any failures
of the sort you see. Even with a 1ms period:
~/downloads$ ./sched_latency_lkml

Ooops, i must admit i have the nvidia binary only kernel module loaded,
but i suppose this wouldn't make a difference for the better ;)
I got high resolution timers enabled and left the softirq threads at
their defaults.
