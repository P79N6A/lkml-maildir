Why?
Very good point, but, in my opinion, it should be still resonable for
both sides: it simply means such changes are mostly unusable for the
other side, but nobody is going to waste time for marking all these
places, or care about suing if accidentally the changes, after some
adaptation, are usable for the other side. Unless you think or know
that "#include xyz" or "print_linux_way()" should add more than these
(maybe unusable) words or lines only?
