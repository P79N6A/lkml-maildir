For now, the workaround is to not enable the RAM above 4GB.
Your kernel .config file should therefore have these two lines:
CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y
# CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G is not set
Later, once the issue is fixed at the driver level (soon),
you can get your high memory back again by enabling CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G,
though this will cost a few percent of performance in the extra
page table overhead it creates.
