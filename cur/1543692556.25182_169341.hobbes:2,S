If 'make modules' doesn't check if the config change has hit a
dependency that requires the core kernel image to be rebuilt, we need
to fix that.  'make modules' depends upon the kernel image.
At the very least, it should refuse to build the modules and tell the
user what he needs to do first.
All you've shown me is a bug in the build system, not a fundamental
issue with module enables creating changes to the main kernel image.
