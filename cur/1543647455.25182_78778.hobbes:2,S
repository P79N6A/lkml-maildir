I care a lot about Config dependency checking, and you are not within the 
group of people that I care about in this respect.
kernel-hackers has no problem realising that a "make oldconfig" is needed.
But I care about NN that follows 2.6 development, and update his/her
tree each time a new version is posted at kernel.org.
This group of people needs dependency checking on Config files -
as can be seen by the number of reports that boils down to
"run make oldconfig".
Which we btw. have not seen the last couple of weeeks, but I still think
is good.
