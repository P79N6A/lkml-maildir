It's easy - take a grown inn-newsserver-partition with reiserfs (*) (a 
lot of small files and a lot of directories), about 1,3 GB or more, and 
do a complete rsync to this partition to transport it somewhere else. 
But you have to do it with a existing target, no empty target, so that 
rsync must scan the whole target partition, too.
I don't like special test-programs. They seldom show up the reality. 
What we need is a kernel that behaves fine in reality - not in testcases.
And before starting the test, take care, that most of ram is already 
used for cache or buffers or applications.
I did this test with several VM-patches and there are huge differences 
in swap consumption between them: 319MB with 2.4.17rc2 and 59MB with 
2.4.17 oom-patch (max).
It's more than a little difference :-).

(*) If I had DSL, I would send it to you (as tar.gz) - but with modem, 
it's a bit too much :-)!
But your squid cache should be fine, too. It has a similar structure: a 
lot of small files and a lot of subdirectories. But I think, that your 
squid cache size isn't as high as my inn-partition.
