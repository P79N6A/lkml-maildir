In a 19" rack there would still be spaghetti... but it really doesn't
matter since what was asked for was a way to capture oopsen without
resolving to serial-cables. I think the question was valid, and allthough
we haven't had any oopses here, i don't wan't to even consider how much
cleanup work, and recompiles etc. a reoccuring oops would make - and
that even without setting up a serial-connection to capture an oops
that we might not even be able to recreate, without having a possible
buggy machine in a live network (doing normak tasks).
It would be really nice to have a way to capture oopses, that isn't
depending on a serialcable. That way we could send the oops of to
kernellist and immediatly get on to the work of recreating a stable
machine.
