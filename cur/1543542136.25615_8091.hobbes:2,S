People using pthreads arent interested in performance. They are going for 
portability at a (high at times) cost.

The kernel has fast lightweight threading. How you map user space threads and
co-routines onto this is really between the app and libs. In fact I'd argue
strongly that an app _must_ be able to provide its own strategy routine or
some kind of hints to the lib
