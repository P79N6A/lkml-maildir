We would have the same "changing format of /proc/processes" parsing
problems as we have now with the rest of /proc.
Why not implement all of top in the kernel, so that you could do a
 cat /dev/top   and have the usual top output nicely shown ?   ;)
(yes, the last one was a joke!)
Your suggestion may improve the performance of one or two userland
applications, but it does not attack the real problem: that /proc is not
machine readable.   
We would be maintaining yet another /proc file, but we'd still have the
problems we have now.   Implementing an A.I. in every CPU meter applet out
there, while still having to accept that the A.I. gives up on us every now and
then (when someone decides to add an ASCII art visualization of the utilization
of the various ALUs in /proc/cpuinfo for example - the worst part being that
this example is probably not even far fetched!)
