I have been using this basic command form, but I think it may be
incorrect:
    hdparm -R [io addr ix hex] 0|[ctrl addr in hex] 0|[irq] /dev/hd?
if this is the wrong way to do it please tell me.
I am wondering how hard it would be to change the ioctl so
that it accepts an index, or nothing (it just scans) instead
of requiring the (sometimes hard to find) IO addres and such.
I know that the lagacy IO addresses never change, but the
PCI ones can be anything.  Or maybe this just does not work
with PCI IDE cards at all?  I do not know.
Thanks,
Mike
