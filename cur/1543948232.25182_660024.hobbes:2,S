1. if acpi=off ?
2. some system will be treated wrong.
my four sockets system
ACPI: SLIT: nodes = 4
 10 13 13 16
 13 10 16 13
 13 16 10 13
 16 13 13 10
my eight sockets system
ACPI: SLIT: nodes = 8
 10 12 12 14 14 14 14 16
 12 10 14 12 14 14 12 14
 12 14 10 14 12 12 14 14
 14 12 14 10 12 12 14 14
 14 14 12 12 10 14 12 14
