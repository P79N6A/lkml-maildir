Unlikely as this is, since offering the patch would probably be
(eventually) interpreted as giving you the right to use it under GPL, I
think this is a valid concern.
Maybe some lawyer could add the required words and it could become the
LFSL v1.0 (Linux Free Software License). Although FSF would probably buy
into a change if the alternative was creation of a Linux license. There
are people there who are in touch with reality.
