I must agree with Alan.  Low level technical interfaces should
behave according to standards, and should follow a consistent logic
understood by experts in the field (even if it is difficult for the
beginner).  If people try to push "usability" (and I'm as much a fan
of that book as you) onto kernel interfaces, we'll wade into a swamp
and never get out.
Such interfaces need not be exposed to ordinary users.  Indeed, by
keeping the low-level layer simple and orthogonal, it becomes easier
to build multiple user-facing layers (for different purposes, or for
comparison at the same purpose).  I think this principle is much
more powerful than the one you advance.
