Hi all,
Thanks to Richard Henderson and David Miller you can now get the
modutils snapshots via cvs from vger.rutgers.edu, as well as from
	<
http://www.pi.se/blox/modutils/modutils-snap990307.tar.gz>
Notable changes since recent snapshots:
- modprobe -r now seems to clean "autclean" modules OK
  (kmod users should now be able to replace "rmmod -a").
- Additional depmod/modprobe options for distribition managers:
    -C -F -b (see the source, I need to fully update the man pages...)
- More source movements, all configuration file handling is now common
- Cleanups of hardcoded limits.
- Should be able to handle differences in "path" syntax between
  the different previous release (uses ftw, thanks for the hint, Richard!)
TODO:
- Documentation updates
- More testing...
