If they COULDN'T do that they couldn't put that much data into a drive
that small... Lets do the math...
Since we started with an older Seagate drive lets take the latest and
biggest Seagate Barracuda (Barracuda 50). Seagate have decent
spec-sheets for their drives on the web, with more than enough
information for this [1]:
Sectors:   97809765  (formatted, 512-byte sectors)
Cylinders: 12024
Heads:     22
Gives ~370 sectors per track in average. To check that this is real
number of sectors per track we use this to calculate a transfer rate.
We then gets ~180 Mbit/s "formatted" transfer rate, which is ~200-210
Mbit/s "raw" transfer rate (average) if my suspicions about the coding
schemes are correct (they call it 16/17, presumably the expansion,
then you probably need a few extra bytes for tags, or sector gap et
al).
The listed "internal/raw" transfer rate is 153 to 264 Mbit/s. Yup, the
geometry they give is reasonable, and is likely correct (as far as it
goes, they don't list the specific zone data).
We could use the listed internal transfer rate to get decent guesses
on the upper and lower limit on the sectors per track, but that isn't
necessary for this.
Note that the Fujitsu spec-sheet refered above does give enough data
to verify that geometry they give in all likehood is correct (they
can't possibly have done what you suspected). The same applies to the
spec sheets for most other modern drives that I'm aware of.

I suspect that this is one of the big reasons why no-one uses
dedicated servo heads any longer, it's simply not precise enough
(differential heat expansion alone could easily make it miss the track
for the other heads, even if the servo head is correctly aligned).
The cylinder count have been rising steadily the last years, but it
sounds like you haven't studied this for quite a while.
Take the original Seagate Barracuda 4 (ST-15150N) for example,
according to the spec-sheet [2] it has 3711 user cylinders (so there
are a few extra for sparing). I can't remember exactly when it was
launched, but the copyright on that sheet is from 1993...
The Barracuda 50 has roughly ~3.5 times the cylinder count and number
of sectors per track, with roughly the same number of heads (the 4GB
has 11 platters and 21 data heads, while the 50GB has 11 platters and
22 heads since it uses embedded servo information instead of a
dedicated track). 
3.5*3.5 ~ 50/4...
