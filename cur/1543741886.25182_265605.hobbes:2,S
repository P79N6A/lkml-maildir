You may also be the 'victim' of a poorly configured router.
Out-of-the box, Cisco routers come with proxy ARP enabled;
they will reply to ARP requests for any IP they can route,
that isn't routed via the interface they receive an ARP 
request on.  This makes them more 'plug-and-playful' for 
equipment that talks IP, but doesn't understand routing
(assuming any still exists).
Check the output of
  arp -an
and see if there isn't a single MAC accounting for the lion's
share of your ARP cache.  If there is, seek and destroy^H^H^H^H^Hfang
