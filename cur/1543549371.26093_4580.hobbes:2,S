Subject: ARP entry in /proc wrong?

Linux 2.4.0-test6 i386
I've just put a manual arp entry in for 192.168.56.1.
arp -n does not show it.
/proc/arp
has the following line
192.168.56.10x1    0xc     <etc>
where the ipaddress and the HWtype are jammed against each other.
dare i suggest this might be a bug?
Regards
hisdad
