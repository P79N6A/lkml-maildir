Hi,
I just found that the followig "works" (cdrom drive not supported, but 
other than that seems fine) under Solaris 11 snv_30 x86, much to my 
surprise:
  cdrecord -dev=/dev/rdsk/c1t0d0p0 -toc
which worked just as well as
  cdrecord -dev=1,0,0 -toc
I would have rather expected to get
  Warning: Open by 'devname' is unintentional and not supported.
