SYSENTER has a hardcoded return address, that is why you cannot be used
anywhere but in the vsyscall trampoline.  In addition it doesn't work
on x86-64 for 32bit processes for AMD. The only system call method
supported without the vDSO is int 0x80. Better you just use the vDSO.

The stack and some other kernel state are not set up yet at this point.
