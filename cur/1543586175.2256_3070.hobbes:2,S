Hi,
I have switched from 2.2.17 to 2.4.2 and now the sound is no longer working 
on my Toshiba Tecra 8000 Notebook. In 2.2.17 I used the following modules:
mpu401
ad1848
opl3sa2 io=0x538 mss_io=0x530 mpu_io=0x330 irq=5 dma=1 dma2=0
opl3 io=0x388
This was working perfectly. I was able to control all mixer settings, the 
microphone was working and xmms was able to play nice sounds.
Then I have switched to kernel 2.4.2 and now the kernel says:
2001-03-29 10:02:50.054774500 {kern|info} kernel: ad1848/cs4248 codec driver

2001-03-29 10:02:50.070692500 {kern|notice} kernel: opl3sa2: No cards found
2001-03-29 10:02:50.070703500 {kern|notice} kernel: opl3sa2: 0 PnP card(s) 
found.
I have nothing changed in the BIOS of the Notebook. I have set up a dual boot 
so I can switch back to kernel 2.2.17 and the sound is still working there.
I was able to enable the 8 Bit Soundblaster emulation of the Tecra with these 
modules:
uart401
sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=0 mpu_io=0x330
opl3 io=0x388
But this is very ugly. I can't control all mixer settings, the microphone is 
not working and xmms is playing scratching noise (mpg123 is working)
What happened to the kernel? How can I use the opl3sa2 driver in kernel 2.4?
