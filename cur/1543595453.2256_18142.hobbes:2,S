Yes, and the source actually was open for a short time when Caldera had it, 
then it snapped back shut like a clam.  I wanted to use DrDos for an 
industrial project because of less paranoid licensing than MS-Dos, but after 
being rebuffed in no uncertain terms when I offered to fix a bug I ran away 
shuddering and jumped on the Linux cluetrain.
