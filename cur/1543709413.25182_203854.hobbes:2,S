Okayokayokay!  I admit it was a dumb question.  Now that you point it
out to me with a two-by-four-to-the-forehead I see that udev is a user-
space thing, and devices are a kernel-space thing -- so it was a dumb
question.  Guilty as charged :-(
Innovators are always frustrated with dumb questions from people who
Don't Understand The Problem.  Users are frustrated with innovators
who don't understand the dumb users.  C'est la vie!  Both groups pay
the price for.......whatever it is we pay the price for...
Every dumb question can teach you something about being an innovator.
