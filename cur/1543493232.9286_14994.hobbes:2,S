It sounds like your drive is behaving strangely. The speed gets
reported as part of the capabilites page of the drive. What about the
buffer, for example, does that change sporadically too? ide-cd just
believes what the drive returns, so there is nothing that can be done
about it. It doesn't have any impact on performance, so the "error"
is just cosmethic.

I don't know, the drive might be on its way to better places.
