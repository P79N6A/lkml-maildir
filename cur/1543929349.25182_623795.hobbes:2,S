I agree that it'd be OK to test it outside the lock, though we'll want
some commentary:
	/* Try to only show up in io wait if there are ops in flight */
	if (ctx->reqs_active)
		io_schedule();
	else
		schedule();
It's cheap, safe, and accurate the overwhelming majority of the time :).
We only need it in read_events().  The other two io_schedule() calls are
only reached to wait on pending reqs specifically.
It still won't make sense for iocbs which aren't performing IO, but I
guess that's one more bridge to cross when we come to it.
Do you want to throw this tiny patch together and submit it?
