hi Ted
   i think this is better than use the spin lock.
  but i think maybe there should put an #ifdef SMP :)
just like
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
               tmp[0] = 0x67452301 ^ smp_processor_id();
               tmp[1] = 0xefcdab89 ^ (__u32) current;
               tmp[2] = 0x98badcfe ^ preempt_count();
#endif
is it needed?
