Hmm.  It looks like Siddha sent the wrong version of the patch.
The working tested version had an additional test to ensure
the mask and unmask methods were implemented.
i.e.
+		if (irq_desc[irq].chip->mask)
+			irq_desc[irq].chip->mask(irq);
and
+		if (irq_desc[irq].chip->unmask)
+			irq_desc[irq].chip->unmask(irq);
+
Siddha think you can resend the correct version.
Rafael.  Think you can add those two ifs and see if you test bed box
works?
I'm still not convinced that we can make fixup_irqs work in general
but if we aren't going to yank it we should at least make it
consistent with the rest of the code.
