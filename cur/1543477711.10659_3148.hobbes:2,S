ok, i see the point, but... (there's always a but)
if you are going to play the press release games wouldn't it be cool to get a
"statement" from the major players (ibm, sun, oracle, netscape,...)
increases the chances that the comics will pick it up
"IBM says that the release of 2.2.x will give other OS vendors pause for
thought..." or some such rubbish
"Sun annouced today that with the release of Linux 2.2.x it is abandoning Solaris
and moving all development over to UltraPenguin..."
well i can dream
