Everyone has their own comfort levels :)
Anyway, a number of drivers have been submitted to the tree that were
never even tested on hardware (written only to specs).  Then, over time
they were properly debugged by people who had access to the hardware
(debugging over email does have long lags, but it works out in the end.)
An example of this was the first usb bluetooth driver.
But we are getting pretty far off-topic here, sorry.
