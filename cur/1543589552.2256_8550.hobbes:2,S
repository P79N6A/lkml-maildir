That's not within my gift.  I can merely write the code that corrects the 
behaviour.  I can't force anyone else to accept it.

Use of reservations is laid out in the SCSI-2 and SCSI-3 standards (which can 
be downloaded from the T10 site www.t10.org) which are international in scope. 
 I think the implementation issues come because the reservations part is 
really only relevant to a multi-initiator clustered environment which isn't an 
every day configuration for most Linux users.  Obviously, as Linux moves into 
the SAN arena this type of configuration will become a lot more common, at 
which time the various problems associated with multiple initiators should 
rise in prominence.
