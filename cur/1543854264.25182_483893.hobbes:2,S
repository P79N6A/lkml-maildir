Just an idea. How about another variant of srcu which is more optimized
for writers?
	struct xxx_struct {
		int completed;
		atomic_t ctr[2];
		struct mutex mutex;
		wait_queue_head_t wq;
	};
	void init_xxx_struct(struct xxx_struct *sp)
	{
		sp->completed = 0;
		atomic_set(sp->ctr + 0, 1);
		atomic_set(sp->ctr + 1, 1);
		mutex_init(&sp->mutex);
		init_waitqueue_head(&sp->wq);
	}
	int xxx_read_lock(struct xxx_struct *sp)
	{
		int idx;
		idx = sp->completed & 0x1;
		atomic_inc(sp->ctr + idx);
		smp_mb__after_atomic_inc();
		return idx;
	}
	void xxx_read_unlock(struct xxx_struct *sp, int idx)
	{
		if (atomic_dec_and_test(sp->ctr + idx))
			wake_up(&sp->wq);
	}
	void synchronize_xxx(struct xxx_struct *sp)
	{
		wait_queue_t wait;
		int idx;
		init_wait(&wait);
		mutex_lock(&sp->mutex);
		idx = sp->completed++ & 0x1;
		for (;;) {
			prepare_to_wait(&sp->wq, &wait, TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE);
			if (!atomic_add_unless(sp->ctr + idx, -1, 1))
				break;
			schedule();
			atomic_inc(sp->ctr + idx);
		}
		finish_wait(&sp->wq, &wait);
		mutex_unlock(&sp->mutex);
	}
Very simple. Note that synchronize_xxx() is O(1), doesn't poll, and could
be optimized further.
