No. It's the buffer cache that sometime overlaps the page-cache when we
need to do I/O. We was just used to do that for do I/O brw I/O with the
swap cache, but now we can also left the bh header allocated over the swap
cache and the VM will care to free them when the memory goes low.

Not only, also to upload a ramdisk you are going to use the blockdevice
interface over the ramdisk.
This patch will fix the ramdisk but I found some major bug (that can lead
to data corruption) in the page/buffer cache (not ramdisk related) and I
think that once I'll have fixed them the ramdisk won't need any change. So
take the below patch as a temp (wrong) fix.

Not at all. The data will be resident in the page cache and when the
pagecache will be removed the data will remains in orhapend buffers.
I hope to finish the right VM fix very soon...
