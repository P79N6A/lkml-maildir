ftp.firstfloor.org:/pub/ak/kbacktrace-0.1.tgz provides that as a module,
or it can be linked into the kernel. You simply have a function backtrace()
then that generates a backtrace, similar to the way the oops handler does
(although it is a bit more reliable because it checks the module list).
The output is similar to an oops so ksymoops should be able to cope with it.

SGI's kdb is handy, but it'll probably not be in the standard kernel.
It also has even more reliable symbolic backtracing, but requires compiling 
without -fomit-frame-pointer for full functionality.
