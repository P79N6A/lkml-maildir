NFS doesn't attempt to implement local Posix semantics, but a DFS should.  
Anyway, Linus has ruled we're being held to the higher standard of "Linux 
semantics".

Sistina has been doing it the "perfect" way for some time now, and it's worked 
out OK.  This relies on writes being rare.
Things will definitely slow to a crawl if several nodes keep writing little 
bits into the same mmap, but that's a case of "doctor it hurts" I think.  If 
there's a common application that does this, I'd appreciate knowing about it.
