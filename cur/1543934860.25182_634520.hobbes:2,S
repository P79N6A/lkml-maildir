Not sure what you mean? Since it is two non atomic accesses even
saving restoring the registers would not make the accesses safe for lockless.
If someone changes 0xcf8 before you can access 0xcfc you always have
a problem.
In fact we had (or still have) races with some older user land accessing these
ports directly.
The only access method that is lockless is mmconfig, which will work
on most (but not all) Fam10h systems.

Well at least as written the comment is not quite correct.

? but you don't have a whitelist, you have a black list.

That view would require the whitelist.
