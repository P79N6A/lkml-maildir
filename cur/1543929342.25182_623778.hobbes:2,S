Hhm,
in general it seems to be a regression of kernel 2.6.23 with suspend/hibernate
if a user mode linux image is runnning.
With previous kernel versions (tested gentoo-sources-2.6.22-r9 and 
gentoo-sources-2.6.21-r4) I've no problem to either suspend or to hibernate the
ThinkPad T41.
However with gentoo-sources-2.6.23-r3 the system didn't neither
suspend nor hibernate. The good news is that the system doesn't hang :-)
