Input support was merged, that fundamentally changes the way input handling 
works. The new input layer mousedev handler tries to guess which mode you 
want. Maybe you want the explorer PS/2 protocol? Or wait for X to get a nice

I'm using a logitech cordless too. However mine is on USB, and I guess you are 
using some PS/2 connector? USB is much better tested, so there may be some 
bugs.
