- RTC interrupts can be delivered on any 'wanted' time,
  not just on 10ms marks
- the lack of guarantee isn't that bad for 99% of applications
  (multimedia and related stuff)
- using a decent timer will improve multimedia performance
- having a decent timer will/might allow us to better pinpoint
  the cause of the lack of guarantee
- the scheduling overhead is very small already
Maybe we want a special 'multimedia' scheduling mode with these
properties:
- able to ask for rescheduling on RTC interrupts
- CPU time is twice as expensive
- priority is higher, but the process gets less CPU to hog
This way, multimedia programmers are encouraged to code
their program with one 'worker' thread and one 'output'
thread -- with some buffering in between to catch most
I/O delays etc...
For real RT or low-latency work, you will need to work
on an unloaded computer anyway.
