Try reducing the sync negotiation speed for the tape drive in the Adaptec
BIOS.  It may be that the driver is trying to negotiate 20 MByte/s speed which
the tape doesn't support and it is getting in an SDTR loop (which is a
separate bug I need to fix, this is just a workaround until I do though).  The
deal is that in order to get devices to negotiate at 80MByte/s on all the U2W
controllers out there, I had to interpret several different variations of
speed bits in the SEEPROM as 80MByte/s.  The problem was that some versions of
the BIOS would set 80MByte/s to the same thing as 11.4MByte/s on other BIOSes
and 10MByte/s on other BIOSes.  Dealing with all of these various bit settings
has forced me to interpret all the possible 80MByte/s settings as 80, and that
means some other settings get bumped up with the new settings.  Now, that
still shouldn't cause an SDTR loop on your device, so this is a separate bug,
but by setting things to a lower speed, you should be able to avoid the loop
and get things to work until the next version comes out and fixes the SDTR
loop (I guess now I got to figure out how to duplicate the loop here...).
