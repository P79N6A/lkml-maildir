Subject: [PATCH 1/2]: Serial 8250 optionally skip autodetection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi Russell,
Following patch allows 8250 compatible serial drivers to optionally
define the port type to allow skipping the serial port autodetection.
This is needed for OMAP serial port, which is 8250 compatible, but
requires extra FIFO settings, and does not reliably work with the
autodetection. The OMAP serial port support is in patch 2/2.
Regards,
Tony
