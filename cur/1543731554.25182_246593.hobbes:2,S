This breaks here unless CONFIG_SMP is defined, with the following error:
  CC      arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.s
In file included from arch/i386/kernel/asm-offsets.c:7:
include/linux/sched.h: In function `lock_need_resched':
include/linux/sched.h:983: error: structure has no member named `break_lock'
Probably missing a check for CONFIG_SMP around the need_lockbreak defines in 
sched.h, and maybe also in cond_resched_lock().
