Thanks, Rusty, man you are a coding machine :-)
Now you are experiencing all the issues that I went through as well.
Point I was trying ot make is, that there is not cookie cutter solution.
One must provide the various options to the higher level and let
the application choose what mootex semantics it wants.
There is applicability for fair futexes and for convoy avoidance futexes.
So let's put both in, and later expand it to read/write stuff.
