you are right, we could (and should) make this depend on rq_lock only - 
i.e. just take away the tasklist_lock like your patch does. It's not 
like the user could expect to observe any ordering between PID lookup 
and affinity-mask changes. And my RCU comment is bogus: it's not like we 
allocate ->cpus_allowed :-/
