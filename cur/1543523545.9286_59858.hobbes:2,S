last I had heard the on disk structure that 0.90 requires isn't
compatible with the disk structure used in the 2.2.x kernels (which IIRC
the 2.2 structure is the same as the 2.0 structure).
If this isn't the case, someone please say so, but the change IIRC was
an extra block at the front of the disk that gave information about the
raid partition (to allow the kernel driver to automount stuff).
Which as a datapoint, I've been happily using raid-0 arrays under 2.0
and 2.2.  These have been on scsi disks, but the raid side has been
good.  (better than the hardware AMI raid controller we have that locks
the machine during heavy I/O).

Steve
