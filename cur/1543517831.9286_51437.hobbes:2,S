Sure, for one box.  How about for 200?  With folks using all their CD
drives all day long to listen to music?  Anybody can secure ONE box by
just turning off all the network services, but most of the solutions
like this don't scale worth a damn and are totally useless in a large
scale environment except for cleaning up the mess once a cracker has
come and gone.
