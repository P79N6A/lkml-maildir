0.01%, so 1 time every 10 000 tests.
That seems pretty excessive. If the 9 999 tests which were taken
correctly each saved only 0.1 cycle due to the likely annotation,
then that would be implying the same likely annotation adds 1 000
cycles to the cost of the branch when taken that way.
In practice, I'd say it is probably just going to cost an extra
icache miss, another jump, and maybe a cycle here or there... 100
cycles at worst. And the benefit might also be larger than 0.1 cycle
because it could save some icache and reduce cold branch mispredicts.
It will also make the next gcc use jumps instead of cmov, which
reduces hazards to the out of order engine for example.
I think 1-5% is more reasonable a number if I were to pull one out of
my hat.
