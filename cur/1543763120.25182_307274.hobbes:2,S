Hmmm, thanks, that sounds very reasonable, and I didn't know that flag.
Unfortunately, it doesn't help. The bad timings stay the same (still
delays in the 30-300 ms range), the number of context switches stays the
same, ...
The only thing which changes is the CPU load shown by vmstat:
* With -u0, I have 1 % user, ~50 % sys, ~50 % wa
* With -u1, I have 1 % user, ~98 % sys, 1 % wa
P.S.: Apologies for my badly formatted mails. The company forces us to
use outlook, we may not even change the settings...
