And they have, the 2.6.24 kernel should have the correct fix for this
problem, right?  The fact that you oopsed out in this function enabled
people to find and fix the problem already.  Adding a BUG_ON() does the
same exact thing :)
So again, the problem is in the higher up scsi layer, and that is where
the problem should already be fixed.  Don't add code to lower layers to
paper over bugs elsewhere.
thanks,
