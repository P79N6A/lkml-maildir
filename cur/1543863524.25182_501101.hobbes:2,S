Why is it selectable if CONFIG_PREEMPT=n?

Does it succeed in that attempt?  Thus far you've given no reason for
merging this code..
This is a pile of tricky new core kernel code for us to test, maintain,
understand, debug, etc.  It needs to provide a substantial benefit.  Does
it?

That's yet another question we need to ask people when their kernel dies,
and yet another deviation between the kernels which we all test, causing
more dilution of testing efforts.  It would be much better if we could
remove classic RCU.  You say this would incur extra cost, but the magnitude
of that cost is not clear.  Please help us make that decision.
