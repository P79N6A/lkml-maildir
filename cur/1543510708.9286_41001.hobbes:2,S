Hello,
  Over the weekend we have seen several weird email problems in
MTA logs and reports.
- Some people use Web-browsers for their email, and have had problems
  unsubscribing (or subscribing, even).  Commonly the problem seems
  to be that they send email with VCARD attachments, and/or have TEXT
  and HTML forms of email text in the same message -- Majordomo understands
  only attachementless TEXT/PLAIN messages, NOTHING ELSE.
- People using services of  MAIL.COM/INAME.NET  "free email" are in
  danger of loosing their Linux related feeds, unless they will get
  their service provider to remove false static blacklisting entry
  for FUNET's new server address I am using as their fanout:
<smtp email.com sbragion@email.com 60001>: ...\ 
  <<- RCPT To:<sbragion@email.com> ORCPT=rfc822;sbragion@email.com
  ->> 523 <sbragion@email.com>... The IP address 128.214.248.46 is blacklisted. Contact your ISP administrator for details.
  We are now doing extra tricks to redirect email to those people via
  other servers than the one they have blocked, but that situation won't
  last forever, and then those subscribers will likely be summarily
  DELETED.  (That provider doesn't seem to respond to my email about
  the issue..)
- Some MTAs are doing email transport envelope address verifications,
  but are having some local problems and falsely rejecting VGER's emails:
<smtp matrix.it mmeregalli@matrix.it 60001>: ...\
  <<- MAIL From:<owner-linux-kernel-outgoing@vger.rutgers.edu> BODY=8BITMIME SIZE=2551
  ->> 501 <owner-linux-kernel-outgoing@vger.rutgers.edu>... Sender domain must exist
  ANY five-hundred (5xx) series response leads very quickly to deletion
  of the recipient for which it happens..
  Any four-hundred (4xx) series response which are found in "delivery
  timed out" type of reports is also likely to cause removal of the recipients.
  (Right now lots of Taiwanese addresses have been removed after recent
   earth-quakes in there have downed their machines...)
- Some new software is around, possibly a SMTP "security" proxy/firewall:
<smtp ncd.com keithp@ncd.com 60001>: ...\
   <<- HELO nic2.funet.fi
   ->> 500 Command unrecognized
  I would like to know what that is about ?
  No, not that one anymore - currently SMTP/smap, which works.
<smtp mail.zhongxing.com Orient@mail.zhongxing.com 60001>: ...\                 
        <<- HELO nic2.funet.fi
        ->> 500 Session already established. The domain name [nic2.funet.fi] passed in with HELO will be ignored. The current domain name of sending SMTP is [web.china-insurance.com].
  but what is this ?
  (Telnet to their SMTP server - you see two spontaneous reply codes,
   although they do take a bit to emerge out...)
Thanks for help on any (sub-)issue you can provide.
