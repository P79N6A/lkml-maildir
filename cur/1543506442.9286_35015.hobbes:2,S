I thought a bit more about the set_bit() on a spin lock issues and I
think it is problematic to rely on it as it is now in irq.h.
First thing is that some architectures count their bits backwards
relative to their byte order, ie. the PPC does this for instance,
however this can of course be fiddled by using an appropriate lock
value. The other case is for architectures that do not have decent
atomic instructions like the PARISC which only has an atomic
load-and-store-zero (according to what the Linux/PARISC people tell
me) for them it might make sense to swap the lock values so 0 means
locked and 1 means open - a test_bit(0, &global_irq_lock) will not
work in this case.
