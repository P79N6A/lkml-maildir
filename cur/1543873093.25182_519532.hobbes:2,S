Considering that Con's general mass target for his -ck patchset is
single-cored x86/PC-compatable system such as a Celeron or a
single-core Athlon with 32-256 MB RAM, (disclaimer: this is an
assumption) I think he is being rather sarcastic. The only other way
to interpret this is that those machines are totally different from
what Con uses for development, and as such, maybe Con'd find them
"lousy" because if something DID go wrong, it would be less obvious
he'd figure it out right away. But I think it's a joke, guys. >.>
