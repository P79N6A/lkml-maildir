Could be various things. 2 possibilities that spring to mind are:
  1) Amd is corrupting the RPC packets. Try throwing out amd.
  2) The server has forgotten about your mount authentication (happens
     every now and then due to a bug when using NIS groups in the
     /etc/exports file).  If this is the case, try putting 'client'
     explicitly in /etc/exports rather than using the NIS group.
Cheers,
