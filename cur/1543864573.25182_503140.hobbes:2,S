Subject: [PATCH] fix indentation-related breakage in Kconfig.i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/30/120

Kconfig recognizes the end of help text by receding indentation depth.
Recent patch had broken HOST_VMSPLIT_... choice in arch/um/Kconfig.i386 -
all alternatives are interpreted as part of help text now.
