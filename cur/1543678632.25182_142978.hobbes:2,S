That seems strange to me, I don't see how we could cache data from a char
device. It is possible that chkblk and tar don't use same block size and that
your problem only occurs on larger transfers, or particularly aligned ones.
You could try to increase the block size in chkblk to something bigger than a
page for example. I don't know if tar reads your tape at full speed, but it's
possible that if it doesn't cope with the tape speed, an overrun occurs and
something finally gets dropped :-/

I don't believe in this. But as Justin says, this card can get very high
performances and hassle the hardware. Perhaps you have a rare weakness in your
hardware that only occurs under these conditions, although I don't know how
this could be checked.
IIRC, you said that it works flawlessly in UP and you need SMP to hit the bug.
Perhaps your second CPU is sometimes flaky (bad cache, etc...) :-/
Cheers,
Willy
