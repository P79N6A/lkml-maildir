These patches look good and i think we should go ahead with them. I've 
also cross checked with physical hotplug cpu patches for ES7xxx from 
Natalie (added to Cc) and it does indeed look like a lot of the code will 
work for her too, but i'd appreciate it if she also does a double check. 
Obviously this won't work for other upcoming users of hotplug cpu like Xen 
(Ryan added to Cc) but i think we can abstract things later on to cover 
other special users.
Thanks Shaohua,
	Zwane
