I was trying to prevent it with the checksum[0]++ .. but yes, you're 
right.
I'm sure someone has figured out a way to make a checksum of data that 
can detect if there's even a single bit wrong, if the checksum is 
allowed to take as much space as the data itself. I should read more 
about algorithms..
How about checksum[n] = data[n-1] ^ data[n]? That looks like it would 
work.
