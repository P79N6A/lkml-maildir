Subject: [PATCH] Intel 830m backport (2.5 -> 2.4)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

hi,
this is my first try at a kernel patch, i hope i am doing everything
right; if not, please just tell me. (i sent this patch to both the drm
maintainer and the linux-kernel ML. should i send 2.4 patches directly
to marcelo? mm..) 
anyway, this is just a backport of the 2.5 DRM driver for Intel 830M to
the 2.4 series. It is against 2.4.19 but, consisting only of added files
it should work clean on later kernels (tested on 2.4.20pre). The patch
is quite big (67252 bytes) and can be downloaded from:
        
http://people.initd.org/fog/linux-2.4.19-i830.diff
* Added files: 
    linux-2.4.19/drivers/char/drm/i830_dma.c
    linux-2.4.19/drivers/char/drm/i830_drm.h
    linux-2.4.19/drivers/char/drm/i830_drv.c
    linux-2.4.19/drivers/char/drm/i830_drv.h
    linux-2.4.19/drivers/char/drm/i830.h
* Modified files:
    linux-2.4.19/Documentation/Configure.help
    linux-2.4.19/drivers/char/drm/Config.in
    linux-2.4.19/drivers/char/drm/Makefile
The only noteworthy change is the removal of some 2.5 specific code from
i830_free_page (file i830_dma.c) and the replacement of unlock_page by
UnlockPage.
I am not subscribed to the kernel ML, so please keep me in cc:.
ciao,
federico
