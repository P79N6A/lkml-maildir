(That should read "usec" since you are printing microseconds and not
milliseconds.)
I've seen behaviour like that on an ARM processor because the time code
was not considering missed (or rather, delayed response to) timer
interrupts.  The time jump in that case was slightly less than 1 jiffie
(jiffie = 10ms).  It's likely rather hardware specific; see if you can
get someone with the same hardware to run your test code.
