Whatever.  In the past, it was completely impossible, because Linus did 
not post his tree.  You had to wait, sometimes several days, for a 
pre-patch in order to see a patch Linus "checked in."  And even then, 
you were required to pick apart the prepatch to dig out the specific 
change(s) you are interested in.
BK has actually made this _possible_, since you can now see (even 
without BK) Linus's tree as it gets updated throughout each day. 
Individual csets or full patches against point releases.  This is a much 
more fine grain than in the past.

Instead of ranting, asking a simple question would have gotten you the 
simple answer (given by DaveM).  Man, when you make an assumption, you 
go all out...  I bet the Microsoft PR department could put your FUD 
skills to good use.
