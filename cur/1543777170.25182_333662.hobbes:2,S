hi All,
    I have recently downloaded the latest stable version of 2.6.12
(2.6.12-2) and I am trying to use either "ssh" or "rsh" to communicate
with another machine. However, I keep getting "Permission Denied", and
from the /var/log/message  it seems that the kernel has some security
enabled that prevents outside communications.  Any help in regard to
this issue would be appreciated?
Thanks,
 Talal
