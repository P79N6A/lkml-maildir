Hello all,
Can the Gnemul Solaris/SunOS (non)emulation work on non-Sparc Linuxes? I
have a Solaris 2.6 test installation and while I like the CDE, Solaris x86
is VERY VERY slow (up to 1/4th the speed of Linux on the same box with a
simple test - uncompressing and untarring the perl-5.005_02 distribution).
