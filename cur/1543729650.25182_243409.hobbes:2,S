I did compile the cdrecord 2.01a37 on my machine no later than 
yesterday.
I was running my 2.6.8.1 kernel, and make says :
GNU Make version 3.79.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
Built for i386-redhat-linux-gnu

Build process was really fine, no error was reported, and I don't have
any smake stuff on my machine :

smake: Command not found.

Seems to be only related to the -clone option if you look at the code, 
and it indicates the feature has been compile :
#ifdef  CLONE_WRITE
        error("\t-clone         Write disk in clone write mode.\n");
#endif
