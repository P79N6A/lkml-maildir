Subject: 2.6.9-rc1: missing netfilter help texts
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/31/213

The following new netfilter options lack help texts:
- IP_NF_CT_ACCT
- IP_NF_MATCH_SCTP
- IP_NF_CT_PROTO_SCTP
Could someone add the help texts?
TIA
Adrian
