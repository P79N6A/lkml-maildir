We (the -stable team) are announcing the release of the 2.6.16.11 kernel
(because just one -stable kernel a day is obviously not enough...)
The diffstat and short summary of the fixes are below.
I'll also be replying to this message with a copy of the patch between
2.6.16.10 and 2.6.16.11, as it is small enough to do so.
The updated 2.6.16.y git tree can be found at:
 	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-2.6.16.y.git
and can be browsed at the normal kernel.org git web browser:
	www.kernel.org/git/
thanks,
greg k-h
