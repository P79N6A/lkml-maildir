So this gives a real 16 TB for userspace applications or is it splitted into 
minus 8 TB for kernel and plus 8 TB for userspace again?
How much memory can a process consume? On 32-Bit with 1GB/3GB split its 3 
GB... are there special process limits on x86_64 or IA64?
BTW should any of those limits by documented outside of source or this 
mailinglist? Maybe doesn't make too much sense cause it could change anytime 
anyway.
Ciao,
