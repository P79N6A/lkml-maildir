it does?
It needed no changes to work on linux?
it only uses "core unix" apis ?
it needs no changes to the core kernel? *buzz*
It doesn't require knowledge of deep and changing internals ? *buzz*
It doesn't need changing for various kernel versions ?
I remember this baby overriding syscalls and the like not too long
ago...
The word "clearly" isn't correct imo. Just because something has a few
lines of code that started on another OS doesn't make it "clearly" not a
derived work, at least not in my eyes.
