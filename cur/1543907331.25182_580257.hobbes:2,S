How do you check if events have been "handled"? None of the recent
distros uses /sbin/hotplug anymore. Netlink events are broadcasted,
but no failure in delivery doesn't mean anything like "handled", or
delivered to the right instance. Even if you check that the netlink
socket has listeners, that wouldn't be sufficient to tell that is is
handled.
