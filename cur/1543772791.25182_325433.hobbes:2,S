My original patch used 'input_device' for it.
Would be nice if it could stay.
This way we have the following event sequence:
input_device event (contains all attributes like 'abs', 'ev' etc.)
-> triggers loading of any input modules
   -> creates the proper input devices
input event (contains the 'dev' attribute for udev)
As the main point of the original 'input' event is in fact the device
node creation (we only have max 4 input modules, which isn't that hard
to figure out), I'd vote for keeping the name 'input' for the device
event and use a new event type 'input_device' for the class device.
And yes, we should break compability and come up with a clean
implementation. And as the original input event is an abomination I
don't see the point in keeping compability with a broken interface.
Cheers,
Hannes
