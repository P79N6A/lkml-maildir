I really feel there's no point in a NUMA scheduler for the Hammer
style architectures. A config option to turn it off would seem like
a simpler way to go, unless people can see some advantage of the 
full NUMA code? 
The interesting thing is probably whether we want balance on exec
or not ... but that probably applies to UMA SMP as well ...

Surely it'll hit the idle local balancer and rebalance within the node? 
Or are you thinking of a case with 3 tasks on a 4 cpu/node system?

Right - I have a patch to make it a config option (CONFIG_NUMA_SCHED) 
... I'll feed that upstream this week.

Looks simple, I'll test it out.

Seems like a good plan.
