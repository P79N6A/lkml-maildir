ah, OK.
static void use_mm(struct mm_struct *mm)
{
	struct mm_struct *active_mm;
	struct task_struct *tsk = current;
	task_lock(tsk);
	tsk->flags |= PF_BORROWED_MM;
	active_mm = tsk->active_mm;
	atomic_inc(&mm->mm_count);
	tsk->mm = mm;
	tsk->active_mm = mm;
	/*
	 * Note that on UML this *requires* PF_BORROWED_MM to be set, otherwise
	 * it won't work. Update it accordingly if you change it here
	 */
	switch_mm(active_mm, mm, tsk);
	task_unlock(tsk);
So is_user_space() requires that the state of p->mm and p->flags be
consistent: it doesn't want to be looking at those two things in that
three-statement window above.
Good changelogging and commenting save quite a bit of time and email.
