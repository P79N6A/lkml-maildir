Is depending on DEBUG_KERNEL a problem?  If so, why?
It sure seems like a kernel debug option to me, although
I have no strong preference pro or con on this.

I wasn't convinced that loops_per_jiffy was always set for all
architectures that early during boot.  Did you audit and verify that
it is set early enough to use during boot_delay_msec()?
and if so, for all architectures?
What architectures did you test this on?
