Yes, at least:
dd if=/dev/hwrng of=/dev/null bs=1024 count=1024
shows a higher speed than without the patch.

I did not know we are already that far ;-)
I mean: can this patch be aplied without hurting C3/C7 CPU's with just
one RNG? Maybe an expert needs to test/answer?
Maybe some logic needs to be applied around the extra bit?
Kind regards,
Udo
