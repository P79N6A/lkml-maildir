Grr.  I guessed the problem was to late in the game it seems the problem
is in setup.S  Before we switch to 32bit mode.
Ok.  There is almost enough for inference but here is a patch of stops
for setup.S let's see if one of those will stop the reboots.
I have a strong feeling that we are going to find a tool chain issue,
but I'd like to find where we ware having problems before we declare
that to be the case.
