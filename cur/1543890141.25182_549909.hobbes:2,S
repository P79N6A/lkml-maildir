It doesn't matter in this particular case, but in general it is good to
report the kernel version as well.

Wild guess,
	drivers/char/n_tty.c:job_control()
		kill_pgrp(task_pgrp(current), SIGTTIN, 1);
		return -ERESTARTSYS;
This is wrong. kill_pgrp()->__group_send_sig_info() sends SIGTTIN
to the thread group, but can choose any sub-thread as a target for
signal_wake_up().
This means we return ERESTARTSYS, but signal_pending() != true, bug.
Satoru, could you re-test with the untested patch below?
Oleg.
