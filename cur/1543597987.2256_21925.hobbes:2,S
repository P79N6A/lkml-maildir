Pavel.  I will cross mount the manos server to the FTP server this evening.
This server has all of the source code for the entire TRG archive.  I'll 
put all of it up this evening.  It will be mounted off of /archive in the 
ftp home area.  It also contains all of the Microsoft source code for 
all of our W2K file systems work.  If it's helpful to anyone, they are
welcome to it.
:-)
