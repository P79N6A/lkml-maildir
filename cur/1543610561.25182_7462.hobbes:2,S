I installed RH 7.0 when it was released and was sorely dissappointed.
The compiler never worked for anything I tried to compile (and seeing as
how programming was 50% of my job, THAT was a MAJOR issue). I quickly
went back to RH 6.2.
That said, I now run RH 7.1 and 7.2 (depending upon the box, this one
runs 7.1 w/kernel 2.4.14).
[root@keroon /root]# gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.96/specs
gcc version 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.1 2.96-85)
[root@keroon /root]# 
Works just fine for everything. The problem with the RH 7.1 release is
with make, not gcc. make 3.79.x has bugs that cause, among other things,
internal assertion errors. Though it works fine for the kernel, it will
not work for many other programs (see disscussion groups, e.g. -
gnu.org, for more info). So I back-rev'd that to 3.78.1-4:
[root@keroon /root]# make -v
GNU Make version 3.78.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
Built for i386-redhat-linux-gnu

and everything works just peachy. I compile everything for Athlon, and
it still works fine.
