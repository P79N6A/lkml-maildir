Reading through your description of what it's for, what you actually
need is a simple go/no-go test that says "did these two codes arrive
too fast?" with the definition of "too fast" being the problem.
If so, what you're actually looking at is something along the lines of
the following pseudocode:
	int key_timer() {
	    static time_t expiry = 0;
	    time_t now = get_current_time_value();
	    int Code;
	    if (now < expiry) {
		printk(KERN_INFO "Scancodes arrived too fast\n");
		Code = 1;
	    } else {
		printk(KERN_INFO "Timeout has expired\n");
		Code = 0;
	    }
	    expiry = now + TIMEOUT;
	    return Code;
	}
In the above, get_current_time_value() is a macro or function that
reads the jiffies counter (or whatever) and returns its value, and
TIMEOUT is whatever interval is defined as being the relevant timeout.
As it stands, the above function won't handle jiffies wrapping at all
well, but I understand there's a standard way to deal with that,so
will leave that to you...

That's the description I referred to above.

Have you ever heard of "sticky keys" ? If not, it's a standard
accessibility tweak for computers under several operating systems
(originally under Windows 2.0 and available under all later versions
thereof) that enables disabled people with limited finger control to
use a keyboard, and it's also used by people with no hand control at
all, including those who have had both hands amputated.
Basically, it means that the various shift keys (such as SHIFT, CTRL
and ALT) are converted from their normal synchronous action to a
sequential action instead, so that instead of pressing CTRL and D
together to get what BASIC calls CHR$(4) you press CTRL then release
it, then press D and release it.
I suspect this is the tweak you refer to, and if so, and you can
extend it to provide a full "sticky keys" implementation as standard
in the kernel, then I for one would have no problem endorsing it in
that disguise. I know several people with suchlike disabilities who
would be willing to use Linux were it not for their disability.

Very true.

That's the best way in my experience.
