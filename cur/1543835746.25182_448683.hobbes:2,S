Ok. I am decompressing the kernel to 16MB and after reducing 1MB of
CONFIG_PHYSICAL_START I am left with 15MB which is not 4M aligned
hence I seems to be running into it.
I changed it to
if ((u32)output) & 0x3fffff)
and kdump kernel booted fine. But this will run into issues if I load
kernel at 1MB.
I got a dump question. Why do I have to load the kernel at 4MB alignment?
Existing kernel boots loads at 1MB, which is non 4MB aligned and it works
fine?
Thanks
Vivek
