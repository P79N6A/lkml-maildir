Hi list,
in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/15/128
 I reported a problem with 
openpromfs showing both CPUs under the same node name. As I looked today 
into /proc/openpromfs - running 2.6.18-1.2798.al3.1smp now - this issue 
is fixed.
Any details about this - can you point me to a linux-sparc archived 
message or the git changeset?
Thanks,
	-`J'
