I suspect this change won't be included in 2.4.19. Since 2.4.19 is a
stable kernel and the change is pretty easy revertible I hope you don't
disagree on including my small patch.
The typical scenario I've already seen if such a patch was missing is:
- "My disk is very slow/slower than under Windows."
- it turns out the disk doesn't use DMA
- the self-compiled kernel doesn't include the IDE driver for the chipset
  in the computer because:
  - "HPT366 chipset support" doesn't sound like the right option for a
    HPT370
  - CMD649 isn't listed as a supported chipset
Compared to the work needed to write the code to support a chipset these
small documentation updates to Config.in and
$(TOPDIR)/Documentation/Configure.help are really small - but they are
important for users to benefit from the driver.
