It doesn't really make sense to use a prefix longer then /64. The last
64 bits are generally reserved for interface ID.
What you can do, though, is not configure a link prefix for the tunnel
at all. I.e. you can add the local tunnel end-point as a /128. This
won't create an on-link route in the routing table, so you need to point
the default route to the interface rather than the peer end-point. For
example:
ifconfig sit0 add 3ffe:dead:beef::dead:beef/128
ip route add ::/0 dev sit0
