But UMSDOS is a kludge to use clearly inferior infrastructure to get a work
done. If you are building something from scratch, you aren't forced to
build on quicksand. BTW, I believe UMSDOS has been broken beyond compiling
for quite some time now.

I'd prefer to do this _right_, not "get something out the door _fast_". By
its nature, dynamic device handling impacts each corner of the kernel, and
as it shows to userland any decisions taken here will have to be lived with
for a _long_ time. Look at the current mess in /proc for a horror story at
hand.

But it is there, and has to be accounted for anyway.

What if you need /dev under a chrooted environment (f.ex. ftpd)? There I'd
place a few devices, not everything. And perhaps even with very restricted
permissions. What if several copies of /dev are mounted? I chown something
in $HOME/dev/, suddenly a device becomes inacessible in /dev. Several
independent views of <whatever> are a breeding ground for races. Have they
been accounted for?

OK, but an ACL for a file (particularly a device) can run to tens of Kb.
Where do you store that?

Persistence is missing, or kludged on. Need to remember to edit, protect,
backup, check the "permissions file".

Any extra code can introduce bugs, and there is just no possible protection
against bugs in the kernel.

I see no real difference in operational terms here. If no diskette is in
the drive, the drive might as well not be there at all.

Granted. But if will be at the same place most of the time. For now, while
a real solution is worked out, it does work.

But it's a matter of names. It doesn't mean that the names have to appear
magically. Scripts can't plug in devices yet, AFAIK.
