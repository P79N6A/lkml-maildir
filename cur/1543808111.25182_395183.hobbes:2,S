There are several cases.
Passing network devices to a childs namespace, as usually
the loopback interface is not enough.
Monitoring the namespace from outside, so among other things
you aren't required to checkpoint and migrate your monitoring
daemon.
There are several other control and monitoring operations
that I am not quite as familiar.  One of them is the
vserver idea of entering a guest.
To expand on things a little bit.  If we have interfaces
that take strings we can refer to an arbitrary child process
as pid/pid/pid/....  So we should not be limited to what
is at the init of the container.  If that proves desirable.
Permissions checks for most of these operations require some
serious thinking before they are merged.
