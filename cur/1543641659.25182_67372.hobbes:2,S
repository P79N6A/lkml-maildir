This CPU is spinning, waiting for kernel_flag.  It will take the IPI
and the other CPU's smp_call_function() will succeed.
Possibly the IPI has got lost - seems that this is a popular failure mode
for flakey chipsets/motherboards.
Or someone has called sys_ioctl() with interrupts disabled.  That's very
doubtful.
