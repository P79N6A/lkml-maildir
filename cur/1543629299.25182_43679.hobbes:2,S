the whole change would be specific to ia32, I don't see the connection
with mips. There would be nothing to share between ia32 2M pages and
mips 16K pages. You can do mips 16K just now indipendently from the
page_size of ia32. 16K should work without surprises because other archs
have pages of this size and even bigger. Nobody has pages large as much
as 2M yet, that's an order of magnitude bigger. 16K for example is just
fine for the read()/pagein/pageout I/O, DMA is usually done in larger
chunks anyways with readahead and async-flushing to be faster (but never
as big as 2M, the highest limit is 512k per scsi command).
