hard to tell, we have at least three ngnet prototypes
and basically all variants are covered there, from
separate interfaces which map to real ones to perfect
isolation of addresses assigned to global interfaces
IMHO the 'virtual' interface per guest is fine, as
the overhead and consumed resources are non critical
and it will definitely simplify handling for the
guest side
I'd really appreciate if we could find a solution which
allows both, isolation and virtualization, and if the
bridge scenario is as fast as a direct mapping, I'm
perfectly fine with a big bridge + ebtables to handle
security issues
best,
Herbert
