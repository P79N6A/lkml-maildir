With great difficulty. ;)
There is really no support for this in the generic page cache
code in the kernel, and you'd probably need some mechanism for
doing multi-page metadata IOs.  There's been sporadic discussion
on fs-devel and linux-xfs in the past on this topic - you could
search those archives for details.
cheers.
