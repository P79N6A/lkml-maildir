	Having a major problem with the tulip driver and 2.2.11.
System has been tried with 2.2.11pre7 tulip v91, 2.2.11 tulip v91,
2.2.11 tulip v91 with the diff between 89H standard and 2.2.11-89H,
and 2.2.11 with tulip 89H included in 2.2.11.
	I am having problems with large transfers.  Small stuff,
interactive, web, etc works fine, but large transfers halt after 200K 
- 6MB.  I have tried scp and ftp transfers from the 2.2.11 to a
2.1.115 and a 2.0.36 box, started from either end comes to a halt,
there is still network activity, and the 2.2.11 box can still talk to
anyone but that transfer is dead, no more data moves ever.
	At first I though it was an issue with 2.2.11 and v91 (I have
to run 91, the new 21143 cards I have require it), but after screwing
around for hours with it I dug up an older 21140 card that runs fine
with 89H, it moved more data (6MB compared to < 1MB), but still came
to a halt.
	I don't know anything else to try.  I do with that 91 would
get put into the current kernel though better than 75% of the cards
around here will not function with 89H.  A dump of traffic between the
2.2.11/89H host (borg) and the 2.1.115 host (news) during one of the
halts is below.
Thanks
