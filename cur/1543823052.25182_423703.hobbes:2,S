I reviewed it again, and it looks like these percpu structures have a
spinlock to protect the list from being emptied by a work queue while
things are being added to the list . The lock appears to be used
properly .  The work queue frees struct fdtable pointers added to the
list , the only place these structures are added is in the block I've
modified .
I think making this a locked percpu would just be overkill ..
