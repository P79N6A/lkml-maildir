Make sure /dev/ram is 1/0, not 1/1 as some distributions ship. Also,
check the docs. Most "boot-across-the-network" setups mount /dev/net
(even though it doesn't exist). To mount the network root file-system.
This is how the power-PC does it (the only machine I've booted across
the network which mounted a network root file-system).
