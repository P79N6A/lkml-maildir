If you want something to be included into the main kernel tree, you have
to send it to Linus Torvalds.  And you don't send the single files
(besides, the .o file must not be included) but a patch against the most
recent kernel sources (unified diff format, created by "diff -u ..."),
including _all_ files.  You are missing patches for
drivers/scsi/Makefile, drivers/scsi/Config.in and
Documentation/Configure.help.
