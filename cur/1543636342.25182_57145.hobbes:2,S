Well, this was the "unpacked" version. Of course one could do that much 
better as a macro MODULE_CALL or whatever. However, Roman Zippel promised 
to come up with a better solution, and he did come up with a solution. I 
didn't yet look at it too much (I've had a trip around the world for 
administration purposes), but I don't exclude that it migh be a better 
one.
