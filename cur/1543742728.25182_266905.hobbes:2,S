Unfortunately evolution 2.0 seems to have some issues, and the
whitespace damage is one of them.  Anyhow, here is the patch attached,
with a changelog.  Hope that is OK.
----
  Add a comment to gen_initramfs_list.sh output that contains the
  numeric mtime of the last modified file in the source directory,
  or the mtime of the source list.  This should cause the initramfs
  image to be rebuild if a file in the source directory changed, or
  the source list (if that was used rather than a directory as source).
