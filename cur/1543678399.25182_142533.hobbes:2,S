Changes:
I've added my interactivity changes to this one to improve system 
responsiveness, and virtually eliminate audio/video skipping, and to retain X 
interactivity under load (see threads in lkml for full discussion of 
sleep_decay patch).
Timeslices have been restored to their larger values and the interactive feel 
helped by granularity at 10ms.
The scheduler code has been tidied up now that I had been looking at it for so 
long working on my additions I couldn't stand it being untidy.
HZ has been tuned now to 1000 as the above changes make this value not cause 
the jerkiness evident in most 1000Hz kernels. The advantage is much lower 
absolute latencies (see website for benchmarks.)
The extra patches have been incorporated into the full patch now that I've had 
people testing them and bugfixes have been included.
Packet writing is available again separately.
What happened to ck2? Long story involving not enough sleep and posting a dud 
patch. This is what ck2 was supposed to be...
Thanks to all those people who have been aggressively testing the ck2 pre 
patches, and those sending me patch cleanups.
