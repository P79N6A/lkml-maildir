FYI, for Linus' BK tree procmail was telling me, if it encountered a patch on
the commits list which was signed-off by me.

And yet another reason: to monitor if files/subsystems I'm interested in are
changed.
Summarized: I'd be happy with a mailing list that would send out all patches
(incl. full comment headers, cfr. bk-commit) that Linus commits.
An added bonus would be that people would really be able to reconstruct the
full tree from the mails, unlike with bk-commits (due to `strange' csets caused
by merges). Just make sure there are strictly monotone sequence numbers in the
individual mails.
