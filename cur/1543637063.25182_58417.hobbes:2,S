Two plausible definitions:
The Magic Garden Explained calls them "information nodes".
A really old (1983) Byte Book called Introducing the Unix System has
this to say:
	A file in the UNIX system is described by an object called an
	"i-node".  We think that the name means "interior node", since
	the UNIX file-system is (in principle at least) a directed
	graph.  For every file there is a single i-node that describes
	that file, and contains pointers to blocks that comprise that
	file.
So, what do you _want_ it to mean? :-)
