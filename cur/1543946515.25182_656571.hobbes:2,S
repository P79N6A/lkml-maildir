Hi Linus,
Please pull the 'drm-patches' branch from

Mainly fixes for i915 suspend/resume issues, sis/radeon pci id addition,
and initial support for the GART on the AMD rs690 chipsets, along with 
the final nopage removal.
Dave.

    drm/i915: Fix hibernate save/restore of VGA attribute regs
    
    In hibernate, we may end up calling the VGA save regs function twice, so we need to make sure it's idempotent.  That means leaving ARX in index mode after the first save operation.  Fixes hibernate on 965.

    drm/i915 more registers for S3 (DSPCLK_GATE_D, CACHE_MODE_0, MI_ARB_STATE)
    
    Failing to preserve the MI_ARB_STATE register was causing FIFO underruns on
    the VGA output on my HP 2510p after resume.

    drm/i915: restore pipeconf regs unconditionally
    
    On many chipsets, the checks for DPLL enable or VGA mode will prevent the pipeconf regs from being restored, which could result in a blank display or X failing to come back after resume.  So restore them unconditionally along with actually restoring pipe B's palette correctly.

    drm/i915: save/restore interrupt state
    
    On resume, if the interrupt state isn't restored correctly, we may end
    up with a flood of unexpected or ill-timed interrupts, which could cause
    the kernel to disable the interrupt or vblank events to happen at the
    wrong time.  So save/restore them properly.
