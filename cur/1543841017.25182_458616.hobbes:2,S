David wrote most of this code.  But in fact one doesn't need AFS knowledge
to see that it's not needed.
Take a look at block_sync_page:
void block_sync_page(struct page *page)
{
	struct address_space *mapping;
	smp_mb();
	mapping = page_mapping(page);
	if (mapping)
		blk_run_backing_dev(mapping->backing_dev_info, page);
}
so it's a wrapper around blk_run_backing_dev:
static inline void blk_run_backing_dev(struct backing_dev_info *bdi,
				       struct page *page)
{
	if (bdi && bdi->unplug_io_fn)
		bdi->unplug_io_fn(bdi, page);
}
AFS never sets a backing_dev_info on it's own and thus uses
&default_backing_dev_info which sets the unplug_io_fn to
default_unplug_io_fn.  default_unplug_io_fn is a no-op, and thus
block_sync_page does nothing for AFS.
It thus can be safely removed, even without the #if 0
