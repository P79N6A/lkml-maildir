I  didn't explain myself.  The preview  kit contains  all the relative
source, as far as I can tell  (I didn't study  it thoroughly yet), and
you can get it quite easily by registering  on Montavista site, so you
don't need me to post the written form (which  I couldn't find, by the
way, but see above about quick examination).  I didn't find any source
code for their XIP implementation, though, so I'm still in the process
of verifying whether they provided  it in binary  form or quite simply
it's not provided in  the preview kit.  I think  the latter  option is
true, since all  various Montavista offerings,  CEE amongst  them, all
link to  the same   "preview  kit".   Anyway,   I'm in touch  with   a
representative from Montavista  who is  gathering "technical info"  on
this matter
bye,
andrea
