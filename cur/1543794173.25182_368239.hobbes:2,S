Does it mean that you support ndiswrapper just because you wrote it?
I understand this, but it's not a valid technical reason why
it should be supported.

Companies got nice excuse for not giving us docs, making those
months/years even longer.

Ok, how can we make any progress on obtaining docs for TI acx wireless
chipset? Or on Prism54 "softmac" chipset? The reply is "Open source
driver already exists (ndiswrapper), go away".
BTW, a few of wireless developers are interested in writing _open source
firmware_ (not just driver) for these, and it is not that hard to do,
if only we had the docs on components which make up the device.
Both of those are based on ARM processor + some specialized chips.
How can we hope to persuade companies into releasing that info
when they are escaping from giving us even docs on "external" interface
to their firmware with ndiswrapper argument, let alone on "internal"
components?
