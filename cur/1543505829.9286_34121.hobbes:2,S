  Hi,
  I'm using the 2.3.13 kernel and the new 2.3.9 ppp package, as mentionned
in the 'Changes' document.
  Since then, my ppp link is working very well as always, but my
/var/log/messages is being flood with this message :
Aug 14 19:30:03 coruscant kernel: PPP: VJ decompression error
  What does it means?
  What's the 'VJ' decompression?
  Is this dangerous? Should I care?
         Thanks in advance,
                  DindinX
