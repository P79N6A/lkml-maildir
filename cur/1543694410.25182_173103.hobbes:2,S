I guess I don't understand this objection.
I'm having a hard time understanding the requirements for your PRNG.
In one place you say you just want uniqueness, but then in another
place you talk about it being easy to guess.  If all we care about is
uniqueness, why should ease of guessing matter?  I'm confused.
If all we need is uniqueness, then I don't see what's wrong with grabbing
8 bytes from get_random_bytes() and incrementing.  In particular, you
don't need frandom in this case.
If we need both uniqueness and unpredictability, then grab 8 bytes
from get_random_bytes() each time you need a new value.  This will
satisfy both your requirements.  If you truly do need something hard
to guess, nothing less than a full-strength crypto PRNG will suffice.
In particular, frandom won't help you in this case.
What am I missing?
