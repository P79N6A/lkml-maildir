	DRBD wants to go mainline.
	please have a look at the "for-linus" branch of
	git://git.drbd.org/home/git/linux-drbd.git.
Longer story:
Hi there,
for lkml readers who don't know about DRBD yet:
DRBD is the distributed replicated block device,
a stacked block device driver as developed mainly
by Lars Ellenberg and Philipp Reisner
both employed at Linbit.
We implement shared-disk semantics in a shared-nothing cluster.
yes, we even support cluster file systems (OCFS2, GFS2)
[support for this is somewhat clumsy, still,
mainly userland/setup/convenience issues.
but that will improve.]
to actually use it you will need some userland tools
(drbdadm, drbdmeta, drbdsetup).
most unfortunate current limitations:
we support only 2 nodes directly;
but we are working on that, too :)
I'm going to give a presentation/BoF about it
at linux-conf.eu in September.
Currently we are at "stable version 8.0.y" (y == 4 right now,
8.0.5 to be released within a few days.
we have a project home page 
http://www.drbd.org
we have some mention on the linux-HA project 
http://www.linux-ha.org/DRBD
(both are slightly out-dated, unfortunately...)
our subversion repository (yeah, sorry, there has been no git back then)
is at 
http://svn.drbd.org/drbd/branches/drbd-8.0
and, we have a user base...
[drbd-user readers who are in a position to do so:
please help us get this into mainline! ]
Now, finally, we have a git repository of the kernel module part, too:
 git://git.drbd.org/home/git/linux-drbd.git
it has two branches currently,
 master, which tracks ...torvalds/linux-2.6.git, and 
 for-linus, which tracks the cleaned up patch meant for inclusin in
mainline.
so if interessted please do
 git fetch git://git.drbd.org/home/git/linux-drbd.git +for-linus:drbd-8.0
to get a local branch named drbd-8.0 where you can inspect it.
see below for a diffstat of master..for-linus.
Jens, Andrew, anyone: please review,
and give me advice how to proceed from here.
technically, would you prefer
frequent rebase of the "for-linus" branch,
or rather merges back and forth?
Cheers,
	Lars
