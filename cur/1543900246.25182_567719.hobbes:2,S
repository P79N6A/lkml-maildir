I'll certainly admit the kexec idea is vaporware currently, but it does
differ in a significant way from freezer-based approaches, such that I
don't think it should be referred to as just another implementation of a
freezer.  Specifically, it doesn't require that the "old kernel" be in a
"consistent" state to a greater extent than suspend to ram; it is the
case that all of the devices must be quiesced or shut down to some
extent, but doing this without races and deadlocks (and without the
freezer) is certainly very, very similar to what needs to be done for
suspend to ram, which will need to be solved anyway.  Unlike the
existing hibernate approaches, however, it will not be necessary to use
any of the driver infrastructure once switched to the "save image"
kernel, and thus it will not matter what locks are held, for instance.
