MEMALLOC is the name Linus chose to name exactly the reserve from which we
are allocating.  Perhaps that was just Linus being denser than jgarzik and
not realizing that he should have called it EMERGALLOC right from the start.
BUT since Linus did call it MEMALLOC, we should too.  Or just email Linus
and tell him how much better EMERGALLOC rolls off the tongue, and could we
please change all occurances of MEMALLOC to EMERGALLOC.  Then don't read
your email for a week ;-)
Inventing a new name for an existing thing is very poor taste on grounds of
grepability alone.

Daniel
