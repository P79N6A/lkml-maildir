Did you also send it to the I2C mailing list like Greg asked you to do?
More comments:
diffstat summary, like so, would be nice:

Use tabs, not spaces.  Happens other places too.

Don't need to indent case statements... (repeating myself).

No break needed here ?

There are several of these.  Why not just return rc ?
Kconfig says that the module (if selected) will be called
i2c-mcf5282lite, but Makefile builds
+obj-$(CONFIG_I2C_MCF5282LITE)   += i2c-mcf5282.o
(i.e., no "lite").
