While you're working in this area, Alan, would you like to also move some
of the old cruft from fs/stat.c into a new file which can be conditionally
linked?  Perhaps even the same one.  Or perhaps we can just delete these
syscalls, since I haven't noticed David Parsons complaining about `using
old stat() call. Recompile your binary' messages filling his syslog.
At the very least, we should invert the sense of the #if in stat.c:
#if defined(__i386__) || defined(__m68k__) || defined(__arm__)
is a lot better than
#if !defined(__alpha__) && !defined(__sparc__) && !defined(__ia64__)
since new architectures will not require these syscalls.
