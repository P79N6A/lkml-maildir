Thanks for doing these tests. Unfortunately I've never seen this problem 
before. Might be it's because the whole linux-irda system is assumed to be 
build as module and I've almost never tried compiling it into the kernel.
Anyway, of course I agree with you the stuff must not break compiling. 
It looks like you are right, there's a linux/version.h missing in the 
includes. Does this solve the issue for you (it does for me)?

The 2.5/2.4 differences are only temporarily there and due to the usual 
approach to apply new stuff to 2.5 first before moving into 2.4. The 
current 2.5 code should go into 2.4 rather soon and there will be further 
changes along this path. So the compatibility defines are there for a good 
reason and the very few differences between 2.4 and 2.5 (wrt. this 
driver) do not justify the increased effort of having two versions.

If this gets removed I can assure you the driver won't compile ;-)
Please apply the following fix.
Thanks
Martin
