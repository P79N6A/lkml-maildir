This could not be more wrong. mke2fs will query the size of the
loop device, and make the correct size file system regardless
of whether it's file or block device backed. And it will not
try to use all RAM in the system?! This is loop, not a ramdisk.
Dirty buffers will be flushed to loop like any other block
device in the system, if that doesn't work then we have a mm
bug.
The previous answer was right -- loop has been broken for quite
some time, but use -ac latest on top of 2.4.2 and it should work
flawlessly for you.
