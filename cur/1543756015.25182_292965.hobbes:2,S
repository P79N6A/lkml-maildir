Hi!
In 2.6.11-rc[23], I get problems after swsusp resume:
Feb  4 23:54:39 amd kernel: Restarting tasks...<3>hub 3-0:1.0:
over-current change on port 1
Feb  4 23:54:39 amd kernel:  done
Feb  4 23:54:39 amd kernel: hub 3-0:1.0: connect-debounce failed, port
1 disabled
Feb  4 23:54:39 amd kernel: hub 3-0:1.0: over-current change on port 2
Feb  4 23:54:39 amd kernel: usb 3-2: USB disconnect, address 2
After unplugging usb bluetooth key, machine hung. Sysrq still
responded with help but I could not get any usefull output.
