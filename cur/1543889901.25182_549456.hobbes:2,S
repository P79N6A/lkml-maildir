AppArmor detects the pathname of the file exec'd at the time the parent
exec's it, and not anything inside the child involving argv[0].
As such, AA can detect whether you did exec("gzip") or exec("gunzip")
and apply the policy relevant to the program. It could apply different
policies to each of them, so whether it has access to /tmp/mumble/barf
depends on whether you called it 'gzip' or 'gunzip'. Caveat: it makes no
sense to profile either gzip or gunzip in the AppArmor model, so I won't
defend what kind of policy you would put on them.
Finally, AA doesn't care what the contents of the executable are. We
assume that it is a copy of metasploit or something, and confine it to
access only the resources that the policy says.

AppArmor does address it, and I hope this explains how we detect which
of multiple hard links to a file you used to access the file without
mucking about with argv[0].
