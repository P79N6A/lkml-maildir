Hello,
when I upgraded to 2.4.14, I found that console-switching doesn't work
anymore with the latest NVIDIA driver installed. When I try to return
to the console from X11 the system simply hangs (this includes
shutdown, which makes it a real problem). Reverting to 2.4.13 fixed
things. Sorry I can't report more hints.
Regards,
    Michael
