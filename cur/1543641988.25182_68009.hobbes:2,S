Probably overkill, but 50+ times I'd guess, each time as I re-arranged the order of the listing in /etc/ld.so.conf, which currently looks like this:
/usr/kerberos/lib
/usr/X11R6/lib
/usr/local/kde/lib
/usr/lib
/usr/lib/qt-2.3.1/lib
/usr/lib/qt-1.45/lib
/usr/lib/qt2/lib
/usr/local/lib
/usr/local/lib/sane
/usr/lib/qt-3.0.4/lib
Those libraries are, according to locate:

And I just rm'd the usual suspects in the mosfet-liquid src dir, reset QTDIR to the Aug 8th versions
and reran ./configure, getting this:
checking for Qt... configure: error: Qt (>= Qt 3.0.2) (library qt-mt) not found. Please check your installation!
For more details about this problem, look at the end of config.log.
Make sure that you have compiled Qt with thread support!
Now, from config.log, line 9454:
configure:9454: checking for Qt

This report goes on for another 1000 or more lines
each one naming a different include.
It appears the real problem might be the includes, as in a
qt2 or older (1.45) version lives at /usr/local/qt/include
But, I just mv'd that /usr/local/qt dir to qt-orig, and made a link from qt to
/usr/lib/qt-3.0.4 and it fails for not finding anything qt related then.
Then i did a locate on 4/include/q and linked /usr/local/qt to that.
That was /usr/src/garnome-0.12.2/kde/qt-copy/work/qt-copy-3.0.4
apparently the only place valid includes lives for qt-3.0.4!  In 
other words, it fsking worked!  ./configure actually ran.
Now I'm seeing if it will make.
Nope, half a kajillion undefined references at collect2 time.
But I didn't set $QTDIR to that .
Didn't help...
I'm going out for a haircut and a monitor for my old vintage coco3.
Maybe someplace in all this blather, is a clue, he said pleadingly.
