hi all,
 Best regards.
I'm using gdb 4.18 , on 2.2.12 , RH6.0 and trying to debug a
multi-threaded application. Everything is fine except one thing.
Inspite of my threads calling "pthread-detach", when the app is run thru
gdb, gdb doesn't let go of the threads, and soon I have this plethora of
defunct threads.
The program works just fine wihtout gdb. Help!!
Thanks ,
Aadi.
