This is on a UMAX laptop, K6-2/300MHz processor. Most stuff except
that which is needed to boot is compiled as a module.
RedHat 5.2 base, but various bits upgraded manually (not gcc, though)
I had just recovered from save-to-disk, and had just started to type
some stuff in a root shell when it went away. There was some stuff
on the console, but I didn't have anything to write on...
kernel 2.2.1, no patches. XFree86 3.3.3, and fvwm2 was running.
Since I rebooted to the same kernel, I just:
% ksymoops < /var/log/messages
Options used: -V (default)
              -o /lib/modules/2.2.1/ (default)
              -k /proc/ksyms (default)
              -l /proc/modules (default)
              -m /usr/src/linux/System.map (default)
              -c 1 (default)
You did not tell me where to find symbol information.  I will assume
that the log matches the kernel and modules that are running right now
and I'll use the default options above for symbol resolution.
If the current kernel and/or modules do not match the log, you can get
more accurate output by telling me the kernel version and where to find
map, modules, ksyms etc.  ksymoops -h explains the options.
Warning in compare_ksyms_lsmod, module i82365 is in lsmod but not in ksyms, probably no symbols exported
Warning in compare_ksyms_lsmod, module pcnet_cs is in lsmod but not in ksyms, probably no symbols exported
