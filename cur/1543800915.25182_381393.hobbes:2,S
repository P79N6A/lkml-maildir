Technicall it's trivial to implement the soft-mixing in the kernel.
The question is whether it's the right implementation.
We have a user-space softmix for ALSA, and aoss wrapper for OSS using
it.  (I know aoss still has some problems that should be fixed,
though.)
Anyway, the softmix problem has no relation with the deprecation of
OSS drivers in Linux kernel tree.  They don't do softmix.  So,
comparing with NetBSD or claiming the unimplemented feature is
irrelevant with $SUBJECT.
