You could just write to l-k.

I have just compiled one 2.3.26 with only aty128fb and got almost "garbage" on
the screen at the initialisation of the aty128fb and the boot process hangs.
But I don't know how to give the parameters to the kernel ?
Something like (with lilo): 2.3.26 video=aty128fb:mode???

Great, and maybe just addind one little doc for atyfb and aty128fb (not much,
just the usage) would be tremendous :-)

So I am near sure in a near future I'll be able to use my two monitors ;-)

Thanks you very much for helping me and writing the driver!
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
