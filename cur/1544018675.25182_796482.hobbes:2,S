Putting my smartmontools hat on that SAT ATA status
return descriptor for an ATA SMART RETURN STATUS
command looks broken, most likely not correctly "wired"
as the payload is zeros. Using a LSI SAS controller
(which implements SAT in firmware) here is what the
response should look like:
Values from ATA Return Descriptor are:
  00     09 0c 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 4f 00 c2 00 50
assuming the disk is healthy. [And if it was unhealthy
then 4f -> f4 and c2 -> 2c (t13 dyslexic humour ?).]
To my knowledge that usage of the ATA SMART RETURN
status command is the only occasion when smartctl
needs to read the ATA registers _after_ command completion.
