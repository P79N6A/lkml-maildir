Okay this really seems like a couple of things need to happen, first
change swap dependency on PAGE_SIZE, then move the __KERNEL__ define
above the PAGE_SIZE and friends defines in the appropriate
asm-*/page.h files.
Do these tasks need to happen in this order? I haven't really looked
at the swap code at all...
Also, I'd be willing to help I've done kernel coding for experimental
projects and such but nothing for kernel.org so I might need some
shepherding.
