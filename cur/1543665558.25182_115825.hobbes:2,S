I have the same problem when I use the "tdfxfb" driver, my configuration is:
Linux 2.4.20, gcc 2.95.4, Debian woody 3.0, AMD Duron 750 and...
	3dfx Voodoo Banshee (16 Mb)
$ dmesg | grep "tdfx"
tdfxfb: reserving 1024 bytes for the hwcursor at c97ff000
[drm] Initialized tdfx 1.0.0 20010216 on minor 0
$ dmesg | grep "fb"
fb: Banshee memory = 16384K
fb: MTRR's turned on
tdfxfb: reserving 1024 bytes for the hwcursor at c97ff000
fb0: 3Dfx Banshee frame buffer device
vga16fb: initializing
vga16fb: mapped to 0xc00a0000
fb1: VGA16 VGA frame buffer device
I don't see any error...
