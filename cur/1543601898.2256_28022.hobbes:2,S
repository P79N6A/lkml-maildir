Hello Trond,

And what is the well accepted method? I'd like to fix my system,
so please somebody enlighten me...

Somehow, I feel I'm beginning to dislike RPC... Until now,
I see only added difficulties with RPC-based services
compared to "ordinary" ones (http etc).

I commented out kill(..SIGSTOP..) / kill(..SIGCONT..) in killall5 source.

Hmm... NFS daemons wait for portmapper which is gone.
This reminds me of #include order problems in C.
Why nfsd does not die on TERM? It will have a chance of
unregistering (if portmapper does not bail out upon TERM
but waits for all RPC services to unregister first).
Isn't that going to work?
