The bug report that I got was, the machine would lock up sometimes during
bootup not always though. I was abble to reproduce the problem pretty
contigously by using a simple script as:
while true ;
do
	echo Starting Network;
	/network start;
	echo Network Running;
	sleep 5;
	echo Stopping Network;
	/network stop;
	echo Network Stopped;
	sleep 5
done
This would lockup the machine anywhere from 1 min to 1/2 an hour.
The machine was linked to a HP switch with FC capability, and the
IP assignment was done using DHCP, card used 559ER....
With the patch that I sentin, the system has been running for about 4
days now....
