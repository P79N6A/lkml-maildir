The kernel can do the same now in a much more reliable way since it can
produce time with nanosecond accuracy.

Yes, I do know that in detail. I have proposed numerous patches for this
issue to glibc-alpha.

My old patches implement what you suggested: fallback to CLOCK_REALTIME in
glibc if the cputimer is not reliable.
I do not really understand your question. The CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID is
a clock mandated by the POSIX standard and it should work reliably. There
is no question that this clock must be provided.
I do not care how it is done as long as it always works reliably. It is IMHO
the best solution to put that into the kernel since glibc does not really
have all the information available to provide this clock (f.e. the
information obtained via TSC is not adjusted properly since the kernel
time adjustments will not be applied to it) but I will respect your
preferred way to solving this issue.
