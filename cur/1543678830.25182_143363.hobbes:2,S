Sure, I don't contest that.  The patch isn't removing that fallback,
it's removing the need to say "acpismp=force" to get the fallback to
do anything at all - why demand both a config option and a bootparam?
And if there are yet others which go wrong with that fallback,
it allows "acpi=off" to boot on those too.
Whether that compatibility code should now be subject to this new
config option is questionable; but I don't propose to change that.
