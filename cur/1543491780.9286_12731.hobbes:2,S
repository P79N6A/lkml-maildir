I think something which causes most people to react negatively to this
scheme is that they have huge issues wrt overloading the longstanding
behavior of 'setuid root == runs with root privs'.  I see why Albert wants
to use the root +s bit to mark capabilities-using binaries; it will be easy
to support w/existing file tools, etc.  But still, u+s files owned by root
are scary, for good reason -- perhaps we don't like the ramification that
if this system is rebooted to another kernel, or its filesystems NFS
mounted by a box that doesn't support capabilities, whatever.  Scary, messy
things will eventually happen in a scheme like that.
So... who says the +s, capability-enabled binaries need to be +x ?
Trying to execute a setuid, non-executable binary on a machine that doesn't
support capabilities should be meaningless and therefore harmless, no? 
(unless there some existing significance of u+s, u-x files, like +t on a
file, whether POSIX enforced or simply convention.)
if (is_noexec) {
  if(setuid){
    if(root_owned && cap_header) use_cap_header();
  else 
    meaningless, EACCES or whatever as usual
else
  normal no-capabilities setuid/nonsetuid, whatever
Of course this means that the binary will not run at *all* on non-capable
systems (no pun intended).  But from the reactions of Alan, sct, Sumner,
etc, I have a feeling that would be preferred (and I'd agree).  If it's
important to make a box that can switch back and forth, you can shell
script around which tools/daemons are fired up, etc.
