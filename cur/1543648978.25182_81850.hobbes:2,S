Subject: [2.5 patch] fix kbuild breakage in drivers/net/hamradio/soundmodem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

drivers/net/hamradio/soundmodem/Makefile includes the following:
<--  snip  -->
...
$(obj)/sm_tbl_%: $(obj)/gentbl
        $(obj)/gentbl
<--  snip  -->
gentbl is a program that generates some header files. The recent kbuild
changes have the "interesting" effect that this now outputs the header
files to the root directory of the kernel tree instead of
drivers/net/hamradio/soundmodem ...
The following patch fixes this breakage:

                of the darkness. There had been need of rain for many days.
