Granted, but in this sense, your cable modem is also spying on you, 
because your cable company can see that you're actively speaking DOCSIS to 
them.
There's a definite difference between merely knowing that a host is out

This-is-legally-protected-format-shifting-in-action-but-you-will-probably-sue-anyway.mp3 
because you've got a purpose-built agent running on its CPU.
