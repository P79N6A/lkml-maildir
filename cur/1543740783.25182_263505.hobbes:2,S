I'm looking at how to get rid of the inter_module_get calls in DRM to
AGP. What is the proper procedure to reference an external symbol that
may be any of the following:
1) compiled in
2) module that is loaded
3) non-existent since the system doesn't have the hardware
With inter_module_get() #1 and #2 would succeed and return a pointer
to the module. #3 would fail. The DRM code then handled each of these
cases. I've been looking at the new module calls and and I can't see
how to make this work.
The symbol resolution also needs to work if DRM is compiled in and the
system has no AGP support.
