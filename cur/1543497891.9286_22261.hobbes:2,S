Hallo Linus,
Alan told me to send 2.3 ext2 corruption reports to you.
I see filesystem corruptions with 2.3.4/i386/SMP/egcs 1.1.2-release compiled.
For example my kernel patch directory (a few hundred files) 
disappeared after I copied it around with cp -a from another fs; now I have 
an empty directory that I cannot delete with rmdir because it has a link 
count of 17. I tried to reset the link count to 3 with debugfs, but an fsck
afterwards changed it back to 17:
drwxrwxr-x  17 andi     andi         8192 May 19 11:01 STRANGE-FILE
debugfs:  stat src/STRANGE-FILE

BLOCKS:
954669 960720 
TOTAL: 2
Another occurrence is that my kernel compiles die. I checked out a fresh
kernel tree from a CVS server and started a -j4 compile. It died then in
the make depend phase: it seems the drivers/net was completely missing
(I'm pretty sure that the CVS checkout worked correctly) 
Here the same effect:
kali% ls -l net 
total 0
kali% ls -ld net 
drwxrwxr-x   6 andi     andi         4096 Jun  6 02:03 net
kali% rmdir net
rmdir: net: Directory not empty

Again the high link count. Something is fishy.
I use ext2 file systems with 4K blocks on IDE disks; using extended
IDE with the ALI15x3 dma driver.  Haven't seen any corruption on 1K ext2s yet
(so perhaps the 4K block size makes the block more likely to happen?)
