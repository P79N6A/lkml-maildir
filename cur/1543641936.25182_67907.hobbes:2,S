Well, for example, you would not be able to have the same file open in two 
different kernels because the inode would be cached.  So you'd have to close 
the root directory on one kernel before the other could access any file.  Not 
only would that be horribly inefficient, you would *still* need to implement
a locking protocol between the two kernels to make it work.
There's no magic way of making this easy.
