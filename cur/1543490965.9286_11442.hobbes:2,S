I said that it was close as of Mar 4, and we have done alot since, nad all
the EZ-Drive stuff is absent.  We are close to 2.2.3/4, but more like
2.2.1/2.  Please don't undo the series of drive->id updates yet.
I would like us to be consistant between 2.0.X and 2.2.X, until we get the
BIOS and CHS stuff fully resolved, what we have now works, regardless of
the uglyness.
