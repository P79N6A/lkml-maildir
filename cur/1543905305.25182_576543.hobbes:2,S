Just sharing some thoughts. Wouldn't it be more logical to drop the privileges first,
then call the userspace helper program? I know that this will limit tools like apport
to be able to read and/or write files that are only writable by root, but there ought
to be a better way to do this? What if the program piped is not a legitimate program?
Also, maybe it is good to make this portion of the code optional too, so that if no
one is using this "ispipe" feature, we just turn it off.
