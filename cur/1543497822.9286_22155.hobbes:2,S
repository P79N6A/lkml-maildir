Dear People,
I have to complie Linux kernel version 2.1.126 as part of a project
here.
The problem, I am facing here is that:
Even with bare minimum modules and dependencies and 'make bzImage' the
kernel is a whooping 1.4 MB!!!
The configuration of the machines are as follows:
(i) 486DX2/66 MHz / 16 MB RAM
   	Currently running: Linux Kernel 2.0.36-0.7 
	gcc version 2.7.2.3-14
(ii) Pentium-MMX/200 MHz/ 40 MB RAM
	Currently running: Linux Kernel 2.0.36-3
	gcc version: 2.7.2.3-14
Would appreciate help on this one...
Thanks in advance...
Regards,
Shashank Banerjee
