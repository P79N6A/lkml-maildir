ah! Just found the reason: the bug apparently depends on the precise 
kernel command-line contents. I accidentally dropped ignore_loglevel 
(found this while comparing with the older logs i sent to you), adding 
it back in produces hung networking too. So it appears that a netconsole 
printout while e1000 is initializing (or while some other networking 
component is initializing) might be the culprit?
