PowerPC always uses 12, even if PAGE_SHIFT is 16 (i.e. for 64k
pages).

Glibc seems to expect it to always be 12, according to this excerpt
from sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/mmap64.c:
/* This is always 12, even on architectures where PAGE_SHIFT != 12.  */
# ifndef MMAP2_PAGE_SHIFT
#  define MMAP2_PAGE_SHIFT 12
# endif
I would be very reluctant to change the shift to be PAGE_SHIFT, since
that would be a change in the user/kernel ABI.  Of course, userspace
is still expected to make sure addresses and offsets are multiples of
the page size (and thus the offset argument to mmap2 has to be a
multiple of 16 if the page size is 64k).

Paul.
