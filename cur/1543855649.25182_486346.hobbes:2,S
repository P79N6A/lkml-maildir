Subject: 2.6.18 tsc clocksource + ntp = excessive drift; acpi_pm does fine.

Hi,
with default boot I got tsc clocksource selected on an debian's 
2.6.18-3-k7 SMP build (but UP machine). ntp keeps bothering me with this 
message:
frequency error 512 PPM exceeds tolerance 500 PPM
If I remove ntp's drift file and restart, it goes fine for a while and 
then it goes with that behaviour again.
If I remove ntp's drift file, then do a: echo acpi_pm 
 >/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource ; 
and then restart ntp, it goes fine "forever".
Any toughs, something I should look at?
I'll be glad to give more feedback.
I don't know if that happened with 2.6.17, but I'm pretty sure that with 
2.6.16 it was fine.
