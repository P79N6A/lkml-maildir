Yes. So it should be fixed, right? Perhaps in 2.5 then we should
look into:
- moving kernel headers around: linux/include now contains
  o linux
  o asm
  o net
  o scsi
  o video
  To make sure we _can_ use libc headers and kernel headers we must
  eliminate clashes. linux/include/net isn't the same as /usr/include/net,
  same goes for /usr/include/scsi etc. So it's probably best to move
  everything one level to:
  o linux/kernel/*.h (this was most of linux/*.h)
  o linux/public/*.h (contains public interfaces to the kernel)
  o linux/asm/*.h
  o linux/net/*.h
  o linux/scsi/*.h
  o linux/video/*.h
  Hmm, perhaps that is not nessecary. If we're going to have a
  linux/public hierarchy, you wouldn't need the rest of the
  headers anyway, so they don't need to be moved. Cool ;)
- We need a script in /lib/modules/version/kernel-config that prints
  the CFLAGS used to compile that kernel on stdout to compile modules.
Now, I think that all of this has been mentioned before on this
list, those are not completely my ideas. Somebody mentioned marking
structures/defines/etc that need to be exported with a special
comment so that a script could generate a set of headers with the
public interfaces. That is about the same as the public/ idea,
and perhaps a bit easier, since it wouldn't annoy the hell out
of all those device driver writers that see the interface change again..
