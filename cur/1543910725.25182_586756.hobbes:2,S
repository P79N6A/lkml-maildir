It's all completely beside the point, see the other subthread, but...
Yeah, you can't do LL/SC to MMIO space; ARM isn't alone in that.
You could still implement atomic operations on MMIO space by taking
a lock elsewhere, in normal cacheable memory space.  Why you would
do this is a separate question, you probably don't want it :-)
