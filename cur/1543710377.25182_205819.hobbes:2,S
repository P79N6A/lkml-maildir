It doesn't.
I've tried compiling with SMP - no go.
I've tried with gcc-2.95 (instead of 3.3.2).  Still no go.
I thought I might try selectively removing patches, but it isn't clear
what order the borken-out patches were applied it.
If you have an ordered list, I can try a binary search.
Or if you can suggest some patches that I can try backing out....
