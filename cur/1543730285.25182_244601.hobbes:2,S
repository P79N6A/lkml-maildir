I'll admit to being a bit behind (sigh) in keeping
the userspace oprofile builds up-to-date, but Debian
packages (i386 and ia64) and source tarballs are at:
  
http://free.linux.hp.com/~ahs3/oprofile
The latest I have there is 0.7.1.  I hope to post 0.8
(or better) userspace tool builds in the next week or two.
Of course, CVS at SourceForge always has the latest
source (
http://oprofile.sf.net
).
