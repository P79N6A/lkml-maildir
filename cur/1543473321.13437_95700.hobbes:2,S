Subject: cyrix detection still a bit porked in 2.2.0-pre1

I have a Cyrix 6x86MX-PR200 (yeah, yeah, i know... but it was cheap and is
still plenty fast for me.)  Anyways, the only time cpuid ever worked for
me was 2.0.35 with one of Andrew Balsa's "Jumbo" patches.  Every 2.1
series kernel that i've tried, and now 2.2.0-pre1 tells me my cyrix is an
"i486."  I dont know whether this affects the performance or not, but I
would like it to tell me that i have an i686.  Heres the relevant info:
jcald@harman[~]:--uname -a
Linux harman.lake.ml.org 2.2.0-pre1 #1 Mon Dec 28 21:24:40 MST 1998 i486 unknown
jcald@harman[~]:--cat /proc/cpuinfo 
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : CyrixInstead
cpu family      : 4
model           : 82
model name      : 6x86MX 2.5x Core/Bus Clock
stepping        : 1.4
fdiv_bug        : no
hlt_bug         : no
sep_bug         : no
f00f_bug        : no
fpu             : yes
fpu_exception   : yes
cpuid level     : -1
wp              : yes
flags           :
bogomips        : 166.30
notice that cpuid is -1, indicating that cpuid support is disabled... i
dont recall what needs to be done to get the cyrix to correctly show the
cpuid flag, but i'm sure somebody does.  Everything else is listed
correctly, including bogomips... the clock speed is 166mhz.
The latest patch i have seen against a 2.1 series kernel was for 2.1.65,
and of course it doesnt apply at all to 2.2.
