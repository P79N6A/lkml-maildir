DEBUG_WAITQUEUE will be turned off (and the code complication will be
removed) in 2.4. Some of the BUG()s will be / should be removed as well,
but sharing the 'BUG' printk message makes sense otherwise. Wouldnt it be
better to put that single string definition into kernel/printk.c instead
of a completely new file?
