Can m32r accept PCMCIA cards?  If so, this may mean that 8250.c gets
built, which will use this file to determine where it should look for
built-in 8250 ports.
If this file is used to describe non-8250 compatible ports, you could
end up with a nasty mess.  Therefore, I recommend that you do not use
asm-m32r/serial.h to describe your SIO ports.
Instead, since these definitions are private to your own driver, you
may consider moving them into the driver, or a header file closely
associated with your driver in drivers/serial.
