/dev is only a bunch of device nodes that knows nothing about any
devices physically present in the system.
devfs creates a dynamic filesystem that is managed by the kernel that
only shows the devices present in the kernel at that point in time.
udev attempts to manage a /dev partition from userspace by watching all
of the hotplug events coming from the kernel that announce device
removal and additions.
Hope this helps,
