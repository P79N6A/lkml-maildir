I agree with the above, and would further note that I would expect the
SELinux solution to the problem would be done not by stacking with or
calling this device whitelist lsm but instead by introducing the ability
to bind security labels to devices within the kernel (independent of the
particular device node(s) in the filesystem used to access that device)
and applying permission checks on those device labels when processes
attempt to create or access those devices (again independent of the
particular device node used to access them).  That keeps the policy
integrated and analyzable and avoids an external dependency.
