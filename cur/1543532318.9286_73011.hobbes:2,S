Andries,
I am running overtime to fix a known ATA-33 chipset that fails with a
40GB also fails with ATA-66 and its cousin an ATA-66 that fails with a 40GB
drive.  I think have it fixed for auto-tuning and timing correction.
Once I get this finish, I can verify the sample code.  I have been
working on this for two straight days because of the issue.
The super cool point is that I have two BIOS images for the two cards.
Each card has a BIOS that fails and works........
This is the perfect test case.........
Also i386/ia64/MAC/PPC users get a new ATA-66 card
AEC6260 and AEC6260M
Squeezing AEC6210 and AEC6260/M in to the same chipset code is painful but
almost done........
I will figure out how to intruduce the XXXX_MAX_ADDRESS pair into the
kernel with a CONFIG_XXXX_MAX_ADDRESS_PAIR option.
Nice work on your GEOMETRY code ;-)
I am just sleep deprived and grump!!
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
