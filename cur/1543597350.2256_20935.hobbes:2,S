Thomas,  try recompiling your kernel with the  3dnow optimization line 
commented out in arch/i386/config.in  .  
This has solved the crashes for me, but in my case, they are more severe.
I believe Alan has already commented on VIA problems and the problems with 
their chipsets.. ahh, found it 
"We believe its a VIA chipset problem. Don't expect anything to happen on 
this front"
This bums me out.  AS i am using ABIT kt7a-raid with the kt133a chipset, and 
3dnow kernel optimizations and i oops right as i boot (sometimes before i 
complete any init-scripts).
Anyways...  I am confirming a problem with my via chipset and 3dnow 
optimizations.  VIA82CXXX in kernel support not affecting outcome.

Let me know if i don't make sense.
