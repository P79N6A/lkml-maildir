James,
You missed a key point, the kernel people do not give a damn about binary
modules and think they are evil.  They do not care if a binary module
works at all.  If they can break it they will.  You are wasting time and
electrons, or just pee'ng in the wind.
The only solution is to created a GPL pre-loading module with all the
GPL_ONLY needed extentions re-exported or externed as to bypass the horse
sh*t.
What I am shocked to see is how people are being nice to you and not
blasting you with a carpet bomb attack.  I guess they are waiting to line
up on me.
Cheers,
Andre
