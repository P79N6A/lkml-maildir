Well,
let's analyse 'mr R1,R2'. Which is simplified instruction for moving register,
which represent the following instruction 'or R2,0,R1'
when you read 'mr' you obviously know what the source want to do.
However seeing 'or', for my part, I see logicial or operation.
In spite of the fact, there's some case when 'or' could simply move a
register, I guess that's not as obvious as 'mr' instruction.
I guess that's the same for multiple other simplified instruction
bne target = bc 4,2,target
When I see first form, I know exactly what the program do, whereas on
the second form : What the hell is 4,2 ?
So I'ld rather go with simplified instruction, even if that index
doesn't contain them (which I agree with you, is very bad).
There are still in Appendix F of my pdf and you can search with the find
utility include in your reader (xpdf does)
