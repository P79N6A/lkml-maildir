The ck3-aa patch has worked perfectly for me until I try to shut down. At
that point I get to "turning off swap" and the system hangs with the disk
light on. Can't get a dump, and it doesn't happen every time, but enough
that I am very cautious in what I do at shutdown. Total hang ignoring
sysreq.
Athlon 1.4GHz, 1GB RAM, hda:30GB, hdc:40GB, 20x CD-R, multiple NICs, two
local networks, one PPP over high speed serial.
