I wonder what corrected attached source makes good performance of 
getting page slot cluster from page area discripter which is written 
"si" in the source codes.
Because I think head of swap_list_t discripter doesn't suggest index of 
swap area which is same priority that swap_list.next but one which is 
the highest priority in the priority's list.
the si->swap_map which have high priority may be chosen by 
get_swap_page(), so that page slot of low priority's swap area may have 
more blank cluster than one of hich priority's swap area.
Then, I think substitute "swap_list.head" for "next" is privent them 
from finding cluster of page slot when "swap_info[next].prio"'s priority 
is different swap_list.next.
