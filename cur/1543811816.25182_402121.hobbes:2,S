This "cdrecord" package doesn't even support recording DVDs!  DVD 
writers have been around for so long, and the technology is so similar 
you would think that the author would implement the feature.  The users 
sure must be asking for it.
However it still seems to be being updated but not co-operating with the 
community or releasing new important features ... looks like we've got a 
piece of software that's UNdead upstream.
