Actually, there are two patches in the email referred to.  If the
analysis that we're passing NULL to mempool_free is correct, it should
be the second one that fixes the problem (the one that checks
bio->bi_io_vec before freeing it).  Which would mean we have a
nr_vecs==0 bio generated by the tar somehow.
