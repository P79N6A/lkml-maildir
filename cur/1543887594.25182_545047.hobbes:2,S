Hmm, I had not understood you minded that very much; I did stay away
from all the fast paths this time.
The thing is, I wanted to fold all the emergency allocs into a single
slab, not a per cpu thing. And once you loose the per cpu thing, you
need some extra serialization. Currently the top level lock is
slab_lock(page), but that only works because we have interrupts disabled
and work per cpu.
Why is it bad to extend kmem_cache a bit?
