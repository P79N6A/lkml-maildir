If we're taking ideal calendars here, I put my vote in for 13 equal
months of 28 days (exactly four weeks) each.  13 * 28 = 364, so the
extra day is "Christmas Day", which isn't a day of the week.  When we
have leap years, we have "Leap day", which also isn't a day of the
week.[1]
The big win here is that calendar makers go out of business because
the calendar is the same each year, apart from leap years, which
simply have the extra day, and are otherwise the same.  Every date
always falls on the same day of the week every year.  All the events
(like the beginning and end of daylight savings) that fall on (for
instance) "the last sunday in March" could have fixed dates.  Rents
and salaries are the same every month whether you are working on a
weekly or a monthly basis.
Now, can we kill this thread _PLEASE_?

[1]By "not a day of the week" I mean the sequence of days in that week 
would be something like "Saturday", "Sunday", "Christmas Day",
"Monday" etc
