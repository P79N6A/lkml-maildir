The call in nlmsvc_unshare_file() is in order to clear the f_count
from nlmsvc_share_file().
That in nlmsvc_proc_unshare() clears the f_count from
nlmsvc_retrieve_args().

Ugh. In that case, my personal preference would be to make
nlm_release_file() grab the semaphore, then call another routine to do 
f_count-- and possible file cleanup which could also be called by
nlmsvc_traverse_shares(). Call it nlm_put_file() if you like 8-).
However, the test for min_count is wrong. In both cases you are trying
to clear the f_count that was incremented in
nlmsvc_share_file(). Since shares and locks are invisible to one
another, I'm quite free to have an ordinary block on the same file
thus screwing up your f_count test.
Cheers,
