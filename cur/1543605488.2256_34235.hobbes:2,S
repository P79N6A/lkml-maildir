And even if yes, one could just implement the "shim GPL piece" as a server 
with an exported binary access interface (use of a CORBA implementation 
springs to mind for example) and the non-GPL code then functions as a 
client to the server. Nobody can say that that is not legal. Otherwise you 
would have to demand that all network clients accessing Linux servers 
become open source which could never be upheld...
Lets face it. (Wo)Man is intelligent enough to be able design at least one 
circumvention technique for every prevention technique one can think of, 
all one can do is make it awkward to circumvent but trying to prevent 
circumvention at all costs is an exercise in futility IMHO.
Just my 2p. sorry for jumping into the middle of a discussion...
