Today, via the void * function casts in the bad file/inode ops, in
effect yes.
static int return_EIO(void)
{
        return -EIO;
}
#define EIO_ERROR ((void *) (return_EIO))
...
        .listxattr      = EIO_ERROR,
but listxattr is supposed to return a ssize_t, which is 64 bits on some
platforms, and only 32 bits get filled in thanks to the (void *) cast.
So we wind up with something other than the return value we expect...
Andrew's long suggestion breaks things the other way, with 64-bit
returning ops on 32-bit arches which again only pick up the first 32
bits thanks to the (void *) cast.
If we're really happy with casting away the function arguments (which
are not -used- in the bad_foo ops anyway), then I'd maybe suggest going
back to my first try at this thing:
static int return_EIO_int(void)
{
	return -EIO;
}
#define EIO_ERROR_INT ((void *) (return_EIO_int))
static struct inode_operations bad_inode_ops =
{
	.create		= EIO_ERROR_INT,
...etc...
which is most like what we have today, except with specific return types.
