I should add, that it goes from the suspend state to "on" and back to
suspend, when i press power again it goes "on", but the screen stays
black, but network doesn't work and most likely linux isn't running,
because the laptop sucks max_power. (2.6.20-rc4)

I'll try, unfortunatelly the problem is that PCI doesn't work with this
versions.

I just have tried 2.6.22-rc2 and it's a bit different, I still have to resume
2 times and X does only work the "first" resume correctly, but it somewhat
works.

no
