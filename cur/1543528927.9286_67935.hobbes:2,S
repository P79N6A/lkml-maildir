   Around halfway through that you lost me - probably my fault.
   With the patch you suggested, the Config.in file would, looking at just
the de4x5 driver, look like
   bool '  Other EISA cards' CONFIG_NET_EISA
   if [ "$CONFIG_NET_EISA" = "y" ]; then
      tristate '    Generic DECchip & DIGITAL EtherWORKS EISA' CONFIG_DE4X5
      fi
   fi
   if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" = "y" ]; then
      bool '  Other PCI cards' CONFIG_NET_PCI
   fi
   if [ "$CONFIG_NET_PCI" = "y" ]; then
      tristate '    Generic DECchip & DIGITAL EtherWORKS PCI' CONFIG_DE4X5
   fi
   which means that a user who enables both EISA and PCI cards will see two
selections for the same driver. I think something like is better:
   bool '  EISA card support' CONFIG_NET_EISA
   if [ "$CONFIG_PCI" = "y" ]; then
      bool '  PCI card support' CONFIG_NET_PCI
   fi
   if [ "$CONFIG_NET_EISA" = "y" -o "$CONFIG_NET_PCI" = "y" ]; then
      tristate '    Generic DECchip & DIGITAL EtherWORKS PCI/EISA' CONFIG_DE4X5
   fi
   Then the user sees just the drivers that support the selected busses,
and the drivers won't show up multiple times if they happen to support more
than one of the selected busses. This conversion is probably more work than
what you suggested, although perhaps maintenancewise it is better?
