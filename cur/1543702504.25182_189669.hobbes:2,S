Hello Jesper,
I have read you emails about UFS,ADFS,BEFS,BFS,ReiserFS, etc. earlier
and I want to support your efforts.

Ok, I will read also other threads. Nevertheless I don't like warnings
at all, doing this my point was to try to find out if some warnings
point to possible bugs. I have found something already in
fs/smbfs/inode.c -- using SET_UID() with 16 bit values.

ok, what would be nice.
