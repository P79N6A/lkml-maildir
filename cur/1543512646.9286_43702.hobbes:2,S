Hi there,
I won't bore everyone with why I'm needing to do this (unless people want
to know ;) but I'd like to get the kernel to solicit an arp for me, for a
given IP address.
Now the way I thought this could be done was to add another ioctl type for
arps, like another SIOCGARP, to tell the kernel to send out an arp
request.
However, I'm a beginner level kernel hacker, so most of the networking
code is an utter black box to me. I've hacked an additional ioctl type in
which calls arp_send, but the kernel doesn't add the response to the arp
table when the reply is sent back (I know it's been sent, I've used
tcpdump to watch).
So, despite learning a lot about the kernel through this, I'm still unsure
that I have any clue about any of this whatsoever :) Can anyone enlighten
me on this aspect of ARP behaviour?
Thanks
