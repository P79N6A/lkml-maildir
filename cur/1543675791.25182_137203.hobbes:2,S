Can I do this with the 2.4.19 kernel (debian)?  The cards in question are quad 
bt878 frame grabbers. How specifically can I tie a particular bt878 to a 
particular processor on the dual athlon platform?  
One last question, given the slow FSB and the fact that 2 uP's are groping for 
the same memory space and that each bt878 is dma'ing its data to memory, is 
the SMP still a better idea than uni-processor?
Thanks for all of the help!
