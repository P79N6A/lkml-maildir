I have noticed strange things happening here as well.  Note, I am also
running debian's slink and I upgraded my kernel from 2.0.36 to 2.2.2.
On the second reboot after I installed my 2.2.2 kernel my root
filesystem was checked, even though the machine was shutdown properly.
It was not checked because it was dirty either.
I was scared, and I thought I was going to lose my filesystem, but
everything seemed to work out all right.  fsck did repair lots of
stuff.
Now everything seems to be working ok.  Very strange.
