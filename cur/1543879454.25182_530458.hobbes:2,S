Oh, and it also converts powerpc and sparc64 to 64-bit counters, so
they can handle more than 32K tasks waiting (which was apparently a
real problem for SGI, and is probably a good thing).
But that reminds me:

I think I should put wait_lock after wait_list, so as to get a better
packing on most 64-bit architectures.
