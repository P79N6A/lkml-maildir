This is a question I still have unanswered:  Does map_user_kiobuf indeed
map the VM into a _contiguous_ region of physical memory?
Note struct kiobuf includes an array of pages which causes some of my
confusion.  Is it legal/possible to do:
	/* maps in four pages for read/write access */
	err = map_user_kiobuf (WRITE, iobuf, (ulong) vmaddr, PAGE_SIZE * 4);
	/* manipulate data in chunks greater than PAGE_SIZE */
	phys = page_address(iobuf->maplist[0]);
	memcpy (foo, phys, PAGE_SIZE * 4);

Yes, it is in the current 2.3.x series
