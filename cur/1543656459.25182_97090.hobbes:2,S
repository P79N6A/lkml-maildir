I didn't start out hating jitterbug, I tried it for a while.
I ended up not really being able to work with anything that was so
email-hostile. You had to click on things from a browser, write passwords,
and generally just act "gooey", instead of getting things just _done_.
If I can't do my work by email from a standard keyboard interface, it's
just not worth it. Maybe bugzilla works better, but I seriously expect it
to help _others_ track bugs more than it helps me.
Which is fine. We don't all have to agree on the tools or on how to track 
stuff. The worst we can do (I think) is to _force_ people to work some 
way.
[ This is where the angel chorus behind me started singing "Why can't we 
  all live together in peace and harmony" and put up a big banner saying 
  "Larry [heart] Alan". At that point my fever-induced brain just said 
  "plop" ]
