Do you know that your platform support a watchdog timer. Not every thing
 does, thought most do. It's probably worh verifying (cli; hlt;).
Is it possible you have experiennced a triple-fault? Most CPUs reset but some
have been known to freeze and require a manual reset. This can be verified
relatively easily (make int 8 descriptor NP then loop recursively - does the
system hang or reboot?).
