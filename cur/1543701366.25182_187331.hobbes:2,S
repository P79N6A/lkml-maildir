That would not be a good idea. Reordering around a barrier is forbidden,
you may reorder as you please otherwise. Consider yourself the io
scheduler, that is essentially the function you are performing. The io
scheduler will honor the barrier as well.

Right, there are some missing bits still.

Yes, the driver must take whatever precautions necessary...
