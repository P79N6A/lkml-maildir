Hello!

Counting 0. Maximal length of textual name is IFNAMSIZ-1.
I remembered one more thing: if you allocate name in dev_alloc_name,
it opens memory leak. Probably, it is better not to tempt fate, but
mangle names in setup, sort of replacing "eth%d" PAD with
"eth%d" PAD "1" etc. At least it is simple and stupid.
