Hmm.. possibly. When I boot single user, it does not appear to happen.
After "init 2" and X and everything running, the notice appears in
about 5-10 minutes. All I have in X is couple of XTerms and doing
occasional "dmesg". I have Gnome2 with Sawfish, and GKrellM running.
Yes, my X is for older kernel
  XFree86 Version 4.3.0
  Release Date: 27 February 2003
  X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 6.6
  Build Operating System: Linux 2.4.18-24.8.0smp i686 [ELF]
and I had to disable "dri" loading totally. If I enable "dri", and
start X that uses it, the machines crashes totally, no X logs, no
syslog or anything comes out. Total death (I just assumes that
expecting DRI to work was just too much). Maybe I should disable all
acceleration...
