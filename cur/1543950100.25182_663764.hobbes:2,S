Hi all,
I have created today's linux-next tree at
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/sfr/linux-next.git.
You can see which trees have been included by looking in the Next/Trees
file in the source.  There are also quilt-import.log and merge.log files
in the Next directory.  Between each merge, the tree was built with
allmodconfig for both powerpc and x86_64.
There was one quilt import problem, a few merge conflicts (trivial) and a
couple of build breaks.  I have notified the appropriate people.
We are up to 42 trees, more are welcome (even if they are currently
empty).  The influx of new trees has been underwhelming.  Thanks to those
who have contributed, and to those who haven't, please do.
Status of my local build tests is at
http://kisskb.ellerman.id.au/kisskb/branch/9/.
  If maintainers want to
give advice about cross compilers/configs that work, we are always open
to add more builds.
