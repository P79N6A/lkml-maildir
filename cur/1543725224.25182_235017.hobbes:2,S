On sony vaio TR3E/B,  japanese subnotebook based on CELERON-M soundcard
get recognized but sound never goes out.
I tryed kernel 2.6.X (latest 2.6.8-rc1) either with alsa either with OSS,
all hardware get correctly recognized, sound program work fine (like
mpg123, mplayer, etc,etc) but sound doesn't exit.
FreeBSD and NetBSD fixed that problem recently with those patches:
