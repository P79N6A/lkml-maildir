It's worth noting that we don't hold skt_sem in pcmcia_get_first_tuple (and
possibly others), but we probably should be.  This may have been to prevent
recursion bugs.

The situation is rather complicated.  pcmcia_eject_card itself has to hold
skt_sem to ensure the socket state remains correct.  We could always release
the semaphore while sending the event, and then grab it again.  Of course we
would have to check if the socket is still present a second time in the same
function.  How does this look (untested)?
