Yes, it's damn hard at times. I was reading through an article
(Architectural support for translation table management in large address
space machines - Huck and Hayes), it talks about how Object Oriented
Systems encourage more sharing and decrease the locality of resulting
virtual address memory stream. Even multi threading tends to impact
locality of references.
Unfortunately, we have only heuristics to go by and of-course their
mathematical model.
I have always wondered if it would be useful to have a kernel debug
feature that can extract page references per task, it would be good
to see the page references (last 'n') of a workload that is not
doing too well on a particular system.
