 From my current negative experiences with 2.6.xx, I'll pass.
That kernel breaks suspend/resume on my notebooks,
and is a dog for disk performance.  Still, I'd happily
port this new driver to it if there was a hope in hell
that the effort wouldn't be a total waste of my time.

That just happens to be the existing interface used by the existing
PCMCIA layer.  The new delkin_cb driver simply does exactly the
same calls to link in/out of the kernel as ide-cs does today.
I suppose that means we should remove ide-cs as well.
