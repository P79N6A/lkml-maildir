Hi,
Keith Owens reported a swap loop in 2.3.24 when swap is exausted, and
I confirmed this on my box.  In 2.3.28 I tried exausting swap again,
and found that now the memory hog is always killed if it's a normal
memory eater.  However, if I use shmtst posted by Manfred Spraul to
exaust swap, and the box hard locks.  (will try semaphore deadlock
detection in ikd and see if it will oops)
	-Mike
doctor it hurts when I do that? :)
