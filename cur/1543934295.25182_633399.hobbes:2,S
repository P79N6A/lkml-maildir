thanks Ananth, i've updated the patch.
btw., do you have some script that i could use to test kprobes 
functionality? Right now the only time i notice kprobes regressions is 
when randconfig picks up CONFIG_NET_TCPPROBE=y which activates kprobes.
It would be so much nicer if kprobes had some runs-during-bootup kind of 
quick self-test, with all the important functionality unit-tested. Like 
lib/locking-selftest.c, or CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST=y.
