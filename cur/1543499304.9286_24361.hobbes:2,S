Hi-
I'm using the 2.2.5 kernel (RedHat 6.0) and have a Samsung SCR-3232 IDE
CDROM.  With every cd audio player I've tried, when one track finishes
playing, the next one does not start (it just stops).  I'm assuming that
it's supposed to play through.  Since I've seen this in 4 different
programs, it leads me to think it could be a problem in the cdrom
driver.  Has anyone else seen this problem?
Please CC replies to me as I'm not subscribed to the list.
Thanks.
