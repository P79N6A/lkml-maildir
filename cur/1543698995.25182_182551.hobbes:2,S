Although I had long uptimes before.. and therefore might achieve them
again fairly easily.. I'm now on 2 days 10 hours which has included a
lot of compilation and a lot of idle time, and plenty of the hdpar and
grep tests. I have used only the IRQ0 IO-APIC edge patch.
Can someone please note all the patches for 2.6 that people have tried
and what they achieve? Im starting to get a bit lost, given the fact
that I'm running stable here with only 1 patch. (so far - this is where
it crashes after I click Send I suppose ;) )
-apic
-io-apic (IRQO set to XT-PIC incorrectly)
-udma133?
-cpu disconnect patch (missing bios option for ACPI Cx states)
