The radeon 9200SE-pci gets stuck.  The MGA-agp seems to be fine. I have 
compiled
dri support for both, but I can't use it at the moment.  I think that is
caused by having ubuntu's xorg installed on debian.  I needed xorg
in order to run an xserver that doesn't use any tty - this way I can use
two keyboards and have two simultaneous users. Debians xorg wasn't ready
at the moment. The setup is fine with 2.6.13-rc4-mm1 x86-64, no problems 
there.
