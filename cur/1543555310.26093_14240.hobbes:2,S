In the case of kernel, we have to do many things manually, can't rely on
some compiler (sometimes :). So, the code I pointed you at
arch/i386/kernel/head.S (look for "Clear BSS") is in fact what clears the
BSS; without it you will end up with uninitialized garbage in what you
think "ANSI C compiler arranged" for you.
