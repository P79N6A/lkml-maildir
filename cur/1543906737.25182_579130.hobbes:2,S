Ok, the patches certainly look pretty enough, and you fixed the only thing 
I complained about last time (naming), so as far as I'm concerned it's now 
just a matter of whether it *works* or not. I guess being in -mm will help 
somewhat, but it would be good to have people with several disks etc 
actively test this out.
