For example, in loadkeys.y
	      if ((keymap_was_set[i])[j])
		{
		  ke.kb_index = j;
		  ke.kb_table = i;
		  ke.kb_value = (key_map[i])[j];
ke.kb_index overflowed. Likewise dumpkeys has same problem.
And debian using in init.d/console-screen.sh,
       dumpkeys < ${DEVICE_PREFIX}1 |sed -f /etc/console-tools/remap |loadkeys
Important part of my patch is the following. Other part was for
backward compatible.
+struct kbentry {
+	unsigned int kb_table;
+	unsigned int kb_index;
+	unsigned short kb_value;
+};
