I thought I was on the ball when a similar situation happened to me.
What I observed was that the counters and percentage indicators were
NOT advancing for about 30 seconds, and both would then jump up by
about 70 messages and the relevant percent rather than counting
smoothly through. It was only when I noticed those jumps that I went
back to basics and analysed the folder rather than the kernel.
However, I apologise profusely for assuming that my experience in what
to me appear to be similar circumstances to yours could have any sort
of bearing on the problem you are seeing.

In my case, I fixed the problem by splitting the relevant folder up,
as stated in my previous message. However, such a solution apparently
doesn't work for you, so I'm unable to help any further.
Best wishes from Riley.
