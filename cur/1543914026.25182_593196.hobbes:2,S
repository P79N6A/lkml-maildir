Just do not read the status variable now but modify the timer to run later.

No, I don't think it is broken.
Spinlocks can be used, but I don't see them being obviously better in all cases.
If access takes a long time, it is better to sleep during it.
And if you sleep, you might just end up creating a new mutex implementation with a spinlock.

In the scenario I presented, the timer modifies itself to run later.
Therefore, simply calling del_timer_sync is not enough but you have to set an atomic variable to prevent the timer from adding itself again.
Again, you end up creating a new mutex implementation, which is not good.
