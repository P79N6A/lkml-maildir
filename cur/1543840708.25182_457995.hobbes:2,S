The patch adds a call from ide.c to a function inside ide-disk.c - this
won't work when IDE support is built as modules (it will cause a
circular dependency between ide-core and ide-disk modules).
The proper way to do such calls is to add a new method to ide_driver_t
and call it from generic_ide_resume().  Also, if the ide_do_drive_cmd()
call failed, it is probably unsafe to reset HPA, so you need to check
the result and call the resume method only if the low-level resume has
succeeded.
And please and "-p" to diff options.
