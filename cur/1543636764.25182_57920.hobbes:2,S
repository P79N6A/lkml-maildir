On a related note, it would be nice if files had a one-
(or two-)line description near the top saying what the
code in this file is supposed to do.
That should cut down on the time people spend searching the
kernel for code and maybe even reduce code duplication...
Would a series of small documentation patches adding small
descriptions to the top of files be welcome ?
