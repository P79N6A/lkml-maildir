   From your description, I don't know whether IGEL is infringing on the
   GPL unless they're not distributing binaries.  It's M-Systems which
   seems to be playing football with the kernel license (and why? If it's
   important to preserve their precious bodily fluids, why not write a
   little bootstrap loader and use initrds to load up a linux kernel that
   can then insmod the binary module.)
