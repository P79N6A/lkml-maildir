Probably not.

SLOB contains several significant O(1) and also O(n) memory savings that
are so far impossible-by-design for SLUB. They are: slab external
fragmentation is significantly reduced; kmalloc internal fragmentation is
significantly reduced; order of magnitude smaller kmem_cache data type;
order of magnitude less code...
Actually with an unscientific test boot of a semi-stripped down kernel and
mem=16MB, SLOB (the version in -mm) uses 400K less than SLUB (or a full 50%
more RAM free after booting into bash as the init).
Now it's not for me to say that this is significant enough to make SLOB
worth keeping, or what sort of results it yields in the field, so I cc'ed
Denis who is the busybox maintainer, and Erik who is ulibc maintainer in
case they have anything to add.

In light of Denis's recent statement I saw "In busybox project people
can kill for 1.7K", there might be a mass killing of kernel developers
in Cambridge this year if SLOB gets removed ;)
Joking aside, the last time this came up, I thought we concluded that
removal of SLOB would be a severe regression for a significant userbase.

Definitely. And this is exactly what we said last time as well. If the
small memory embedded guys are happy for SLOB to go, then I'm happy too.
So, the relevant question is -- are most/all current SLOB users are now
happy to switch over to SLUB, in light of the recent advances to both
allocators?
