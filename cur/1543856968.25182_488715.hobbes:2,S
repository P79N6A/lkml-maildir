This patch looks good to me, and I'd prefer it over the (twice
corrected) one currently in -mm.
-  It's close to what Daniel Drake proposed recently [1] (main
   difference: corrects the very same problem for ld-option, which might
   otherwise bite us later) and what's already in Gentoo's patchkernel,
-  it abstains from using mktemp, hopefully making Andi happy ;),
-  resolves the current Gentoo sandbox issues without touching more
   kbuild code than necessary.
Kind regards,
 Horst
