Still too complex. Can't this be simplified to:
  * Don't use the kernel text output facility for anything except panics, where 
there is no point in allowing userspace applications to continue
  * Rely on userspace to display oopses and less important messages, because 
doing this from the kernel leads either to the complex procedure outlined above 
(where the policy is in the kernel, e.g., on which of the two keyboards should 
one wait for a keypress?) or to unreliable displaying of messages
  * Have a method in the framebuffer driver for clearing the screen and setting 
a known good mode, for the Linux equivalent of a "blue screen of death"
