Perhaps one of you can analyse my setup and advise how many extra
seeks per boot would be required:
 1. /dev/hda has partitions hda1 through hda17
 2. /dev/hdb has partitions hdb1 through hdb19
 3. /dev/hdc has partitions hdc1 through hdc12
 4. /dev/hdd is my CD-ROM drive.
 5. /dev/sda has partitions sda1 through sda13
 6. /dev/sdb is my parallel port ZIP-250.
In cases 1, 2, 3 and 5, /dev/?d?4 is the extended partition, and ?d?1
is a swap partition.
At a quick count, I make that 61 partitions to check on each mount...
Best wishes from Riley.
