What i got at my last exception (started the client in tty1):
Listened to an mp3 with mpg123. After the exception the mp3 got in the
_he_my_system_is_completely_locked loop. Couldn't kill the process.
System was respondable, console switching was ok. Changed to console to
tty2 where X was running - crtl-c - X went down -> console switching
wasn't possible anymore.
ctrl-alt-sysrq was responding but only with the line:
SysRq : Enmergency sync
SysRq : .... (tried also the other ones)
but nothing happend. No syncing, no unmount and showtasks. Right now i
noticed that showTasks, mem and pc do not give _any_ output, but syncing
works.
I'll do further testing when i'm back from work.
