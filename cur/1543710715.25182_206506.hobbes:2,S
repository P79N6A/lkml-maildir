Hi,
I am trying to use watchdog to reboot my computer when it freezes. I was
wondering if amd7xx_tco is supposed to work in Asus A7M266-D
motherboard. It seems to load fine and GETTIMEOUT return values
decrement in one second intervals. However when the timer reaches 0
nothing happens, it just rolls over to 37 and keeps going. Even a simple
program that opens /dev/watchdog and sleeps forever, does not reboot the
computer.
I am currently running 2.6.4-mm2, but can test suggested
versions/patches.  Any hints ?
                                                Thanks, Petr
