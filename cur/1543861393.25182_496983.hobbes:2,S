Subject: [PATCH 2.6.20] tasks cannot run on cpus onlined after boot
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Commit 5c1e176781f43bc902a51e5832f789756bff911b ("sched: force
/sbin/init off isolated cpus") sets init's cpus_allowed to a subset of
cpu_online_map at boot time, which means that tasks won't be scheduled
on cpus that are added to the system later.
Make init's cpus_allowed a subset of cpu_possible_map instead.  This
should still preserve the behavior that Nick's change intended.
Thanks to Giuliano Pochini for reporting this and testing the fix:

This is a regression from 2.6.18.  Assuming this change is okay, this
should go to -stable for 2.6.19.x.
