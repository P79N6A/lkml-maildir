No, only the specific ->endio needs to know that, which is set by the 
bio owner, so this knowledge lies in exactly the right place.  A small 
handful of generic endios all with the same destructor are used nearly 
everywhere.

Actual endio happens once in the lifetime of the transfer, this read 
will be entirely lost in the noise.

Well, exactly,   My point from the beginning was that the size of struct 
bio is not even close to being a problem and adding a few bytes to it 
in the interest of doing the cleanest fix to a core kernel bug is just 
not a dominant issue.
I suppose that leaving out the word "bloated" and skipping straight to 
the "doesn't matter" proof would have saved some bandwidth.
