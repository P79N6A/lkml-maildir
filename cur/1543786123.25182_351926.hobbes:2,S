Well the terminology changed to "io scheduler" now, however the
residual "elevator" name found in places doesn't cause anyone
any problems and there isn't much reason to change it other than
the desire to break things.

There is no least block number first io scheduler now. And the
deadline scheduler is basically an elevator algorithm with
deadlines.

But that is not a true elevator algorithm either... so what are
you trying to say?

I happen to think that the "elevator code" is quite nice, the
block layer side, the interface itself, and the io schedulers
too. So I wouldn't fix up anything unless someone came to me
with an issue :)
Anyway, let's kill this subthread. I just don't think you proved
much of a point by picking a random kernel subsystem to point to,
whether such criticism was justified or not.
But if you really need to , I instead suggest badmouthing devfs.
That is sure to get you on the good side of the VFS guys! :)
