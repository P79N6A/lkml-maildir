Hey Frank,
Must admit, you really cracked me up buddy.
FYI, I sent this mail around originally to get an idea of what are the open 
fields yet to be explored at kernel level for my post grad studies.
My post grad studies start next year april, and i have to submit a project 
proposal by then.
Unfortunately I don't think I'd be alive until next century either, but i'm 
sure many changes are to happen till then.
Shane
