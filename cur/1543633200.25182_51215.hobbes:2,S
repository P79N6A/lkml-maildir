This bug just keeps on bugging me...
    raid5.c: In function 'raid5_plug_device':
    raid5.c:1247: 'tq_disk' undeclared (first use in this function)
Some patches show up in a search of lkml but I figured such a simple fix
would make it into the Linus tree quickly.
Did I miss something?  What's the issue here?
