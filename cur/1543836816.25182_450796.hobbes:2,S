The gameport speed is used by digital-over-gameport joystick drivers to
keep track of time based on the number of inb()s done to the gameport. 
We can't use anything slower than rdtsc there, and since rdtsc isn't
always available, the count of inb()s is the best approximation.
The speed can't easily be measured in userspace - you need to make sure
IRQs, DMA and other stuff doesn't interfere with the measurement, which
needs to be rather exact. AND, you need it for the kernel to work, so it
doesn't make sense to move it to an userspace tool that the kernel would
have to call.
The analog joystick driver does even more timing magic to get precise
readings from the port, where the value read depends on the time for a
bit on the port to change from 0 to 1.
I agree that gameports are mostly dead today, but people are still using
them.
