The current status for userland kernel headers is "the kernel doesn't
care".  Let the glibc folks and whoever else gather the information
from the kernel headers and create derived, but different, userland
headers.

Stability, stability, stability - are three reasons enough? ;)
Linus wants to have very few patches these days and all of them have
to fix a real bug.  Please don't question him doing so, just remember
the 2.4 days with slashdot stories like "kernel of pain".
