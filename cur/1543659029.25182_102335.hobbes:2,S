Sorry, I'm currently on a business trip.  I finally found a voyager system 
around here to test it on and it seems to work (at least for machine shutdown 
on panel switch).  I can't test the internal battery (of all the Voyagers in 
the junk heap around here---where NCR manufactured them---none has an internal 
battery).
Go ahead and apply it.  I probably need to migrate the voyager machine state 
handling to use kevents anyway, but I'll do that later.
