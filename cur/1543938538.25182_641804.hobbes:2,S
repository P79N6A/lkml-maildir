Would it be possible to run the bootstrap on a cpu that has a 
node with memory associated to it? I believe we had the same situation 
last year when GFP_THISNODE was introduced?
After you reverted the slab memoryless node patch there should be per node 
structures created for node 0 unless the node is marked offline. Is it? If 
so then you are booting a cpu that is associated with an offline node.

Well this means that bootstrap will work by introducing foreign objects 
into the per cpu queue (should only hold per cpu objects). They will 
later be consumed and then the queues will contain the right objects so 
the effect of the patch is minimal.
I thought we fixed the similar situation last year by dropping 
GFP_THISNODE for some allocations?
