Jeez,
I was working under the assumption we already limit /dev/mem et. al to
CAP_SYS_RAWIO. If we don't then this needs applying ASAP.
Well spotted.
Comments: we probably wish to (initially) limit only write access, like
2.0.x. Limiting read access could be fun for various things but I forsee
that as a later development once we've got the basics sorted out.

PS. I've got some more capability fixes/enhancements queued for once we
have chflags() in 2.3 (which enables immutable on block device).
