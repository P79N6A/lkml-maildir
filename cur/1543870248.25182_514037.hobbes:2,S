Here are the results:
idle.png: average % idle over 120s runs from 1 to 32 threads
transactions.png: TPS over 120s runs from 1 to 32 threads
Hope the data is useful. All I can conclude right now is that SMT
appears to help (contradicting what I said earlier), but that MC seems
to have no effect (or no substantial effect).
Thanks,
