So it seems you're writing a governor. See
Documentation/cpu-freq/governors.txt and
drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_conservative.c
drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_ondemand.c
drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_performance.c
drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_powersave.c
drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq_userspace.c
for a first reference.

of course it does, this is just the sysfs -show function and you're
passing it a null pointer as first parameter. If you look at
show_available_freqs code you'll see that cpufreq_cpu_data is
dereferenced and this happening with interrupts disabled..
