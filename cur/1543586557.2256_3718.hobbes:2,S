Has anyone else had this or a similar problem? I tried to upgrade to 2.4.3
from 2.2.18 recently, but I invariably got a kernel panic on boot - I ran
the oops through ksymoops, and it seemed to indicate that the problem
occurred while in the aic7xxx driver [although I may, of course, be
misinterpreting the ouput hideously]
I'm, going to try the old aic7xxx driver tonight, to see if that works any
better.
[I posted the oops a couple of days ago, and I don't want to spam the
 list with it again, but if anyome is interested in the output, I'd be
 happy to send it, pluys any extra details required... ]
