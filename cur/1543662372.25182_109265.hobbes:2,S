There is certainly some old cruft in there, but...
I have been thinking evil thoughts lately about what it would take
to implement on x86-64.
Switching in and out of long mode is evil enough that I don't think it
is worth it.  And encouraging people to write good JIT compiling
emulators sounds much better, especially in the long run.  But it can
be written.
