My theory: gcc is inlining readl into hpet_readl (readl is an inline
function, so it should be doing this no matter what), and inlining
hpet_readl into wait_hpet_tick (otherwise, it can't possibly make any
assumptions about the return values of hpet_readl -- this looks to be a
SUSE-specific over-aggressive optimization), and somewhere along the way
the volatile qualifier is getting lost.
