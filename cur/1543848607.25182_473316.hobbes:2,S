If you introduce a kernel parameter, let it be one that tells the kernel
to stay away from partitions, so that partitions can be added later by
the partx ioctls.
Now setting up an initrd or so is kind of tricky, not something ordinary users
would want to do, so if it moreover is possible to specify the rootpttype
that would allow an ordinary boot and leave all other block devices untouched.

A funny effect might be that hda5 exists, hda6 does not, and hda7 exists again.
Maybe unexpected for some software.
