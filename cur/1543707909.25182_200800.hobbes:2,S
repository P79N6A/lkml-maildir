Sure.

I tested this change to a stock 2.6.3 kernel and saw a marginally
better situation... 650MB in slab instead of 850MB:

I'll test -mm2 with your patch shortly.

Cool. I think renaming this i a good idea.

Why not just check is_highmem(zone) here?

Since shrink_slab() is the only consumer of this why not move the
function to vmscan.c just above shrink_slab()?
