Subject: 2.4.12 kernel doesn't see extended partition

When I try to start my Debian woody system using a recently compiled
(with kernel-package) 2.4.12 kernel it fails to start because it can't find
the root partition, /hda6.  The immediately preceding partition check
for hda does NOT show any individual extended partitions, but it it
does show hda1 - 4.  Here's what things look like with 2.4.10:
Partition check:
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3 hda4 < hda5 hda6 hda7 hda8 hda9 >
 hdb: hdb1 < hdb5 hdb6 hdb7 > hdb2
Under 2.4.12 it looks like
 hda: hda1 hda2 hda3 hda4 < >
 hdb: hdb1 < hdb5 hdb6 hdb7 > hdb2
I noticed you have been working on the partition code, and that there
have been some reports of similar problems.  However, my search did
not show if those problems had been resolved.
I have been having intermittent hardware problems with the disks.  But
the extended partition does not seem to be damaged, judging from the
fact that I can use it from 2.4.10 kernels.
Because of those problems I did fiddle with some of the options before
compiling the kernel, but have since turned most of them back.  Here's
one diff of config-2.4.10 vs 2.4.12:

As for config_pm, my hardware is ACPI and some of my problems seem
related to power management (can't access the disks after they've been
sleeping).  I've tried it on and off.  In fact, I've tried at least 6
different configurations.
(By the way, on the sound I'm using ALSA.  Does anyone know if I
should turn OSS on if I want OSS emulation?).
Gigabyte GA-71XE4 with Athlon 800 Mhz processor.  The chipset is AMD
(I have Viper support selected as an option).  I also have i2c and
lm-sensors.  The drive in question is Western Digital UDMA-33, 13Mg;
the second one is Western Digitial UDMA 66.
Hmm, here's what happened when I tried to run fdisk
wheat:/usr/local/rootlog# fdisk /dev/hda
Unable to read /dev/hda
