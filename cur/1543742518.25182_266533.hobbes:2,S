It's all good, but your semantics and description are very tailored to
your specific arch problem vs. unlock.
What about my suggestion of defining a broader semantic of mmiowb() as
beeing a barrier ordering MMIOs vs. the rest of the world ? The later
includes stores to memory _and_ spinlock/unlock.
I still intend to eventually make good use of that on ppc64 to get rid
of the expensive barriers we had to put in our writeX() implementations,
though I didn't have time to work on that yet.
Ben.
