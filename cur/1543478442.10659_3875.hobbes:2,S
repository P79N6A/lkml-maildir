	They are outright silly and useless, but don't incur any overhead.
Useless - yes, hurt anything except feelings of poor souls forced to read
the code - no.

	Decent compiler (gcc, for example) handles it quite nice. Compile
and look at the code. Oh, and wake up - you slept about 15 years.

	They belong to library. Standard library, but it means *nothing*.
No, I don't count overloaded << and >> as elements of core C++. Elements
of standard environment, yes. But *not* the language per se. BTW, I don't
count STL as part of C++. (Reportedly) ugly library that got (reportedly)
too popular, but that's it. Now, exceptions *are* part of language.
Templates are part of language. And they are *ugly*.
> Is C broken ?
	Everything is broken, but C is not even close to C++ in *that*
kind of breakage.
