Do you mean: make the SMP balancer more aggressive by lowering the
125% threshold?

We have an IA64 2-level node hierarchy machine with 32 CPUs (NEC
TX7). In the "old" node affine scheduler patch the multilevel feature
was in by different cross-node steal delays (longer if node is further
away). In the current approach we could just add another counter, such
that we call the cross-supernode balancer only if the intra-supernode
balancer failed a few times. No idea whether this helps...

Didn't have time to try and probably won't be able to check this
before the beginning of next week :-( .
