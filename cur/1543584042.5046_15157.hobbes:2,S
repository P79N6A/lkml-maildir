Joanne, since a SCSI drive contains a processor (one of the small
computer systems that are interfacing) it requires that the local
personality data be stored in non-volatile storage someplace.
Most drives used a dedicated area of the drive surface, which was
SUPPOSED to be inaccessible to any outside process.  If you were
able to muck with that sector or sectors, then it was REAL EASY
to make the drive terminally unusable.  But as I say, you should
not be able to directly reach that area.
Since ATA drives are generally also small self-contained systems
who differ from SCSI drives mainly in the details of the interface
protocols, they probably suffer from the same problem.
But you ain't supposed to be able to get at that area...
