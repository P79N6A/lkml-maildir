It does not only happen on ISDN lines, but also on plain old SLIP leased lines
using USRobotics modems. It started to happen after upgrading from an older
2.0.36 kernel to the current 2.2.12. In my observations it will not go away by
simply re-establishing the SLIP connection, on has to do a complete network
stop followed by network start (on RedHat 6.0).
