Not quite.
The expression "(mem_map + MAP_NR(x))" has become "virt_to_page(x)". 
There is nothing that is exactly the same as MAP_NR(), because the
concept doesn't really exist any more (there are now architectures out
there that have multiple page maps, so a single number is not sufficient
to describe the page). 
Now, in 99% of all cases, this is how MAP_NR() was used, and most of the
time it's a simple 1:1 translation. In some cases there was one level of
indirection, something like
	int i;
	for (i = MAP_NR(x) ; i < MAP_NR(y); i++) {
		...
		... i + mem_map ...
		...
	}
and in those cases it needs to be slightly rewritten to use "struct
page" pointers instead, ie something like
	struct page *page, *end;
	page = virt_to_page(x);
	end = virt_to_page(y);
	do {
		.. 
	} while (++page < end);
rather than just a simple expression replacement.
