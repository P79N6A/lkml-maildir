Sure, I started the patch to fulfill the 1M _default_ size dream ;-)
The majority users will never enjoy the performance improvement if
ever we stick to 128k default size.  And it won't be possible for the
current readahead logic, since it lacks basic thrashing protection
mechanism.

But to be serious, in the progress I realized that it's much more
beyond the max readahead size. The fancy features are more coming out
of _real_ needs than to fulfill academic goals. I've seen real world
improvements from desktop/file server/backup server/database users
for most of the implemented features.
