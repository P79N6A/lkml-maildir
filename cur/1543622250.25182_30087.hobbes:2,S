Yet another meetoo.
I also experience hard lockups when writing to the floppy drive (fdformat,
dd etc.) , nothing in my logs though.
... Hmm
Do you happen to have the NVidia kernel module loaded when the hangs occur?
More specifically, is the module being used?  From limited (fd is too
sloooowwww) I can dd, fdformat etc just fine under console, with or without
NVidia module loaded.  If I startx during fdformat then machine will lock
hard.  I have to pull the power cord for a few seconds to get the box
working again.
