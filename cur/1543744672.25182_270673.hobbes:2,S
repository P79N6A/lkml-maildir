[PATCH] PCI: add hook for PCI resource deallocation
From: Kenji Kaneshige <kaneshige.kenji@jp.fujitsu.com>
This patch adds a hook 'pcibios_disable_device()' into pci_disable_device()
to call architecture specific PCI resource deallocation code.  It's a
opposite part of pcibios_enable_device().  We need this hook to deallocate
architecture specific PCI resource such as IRQ resource, etc..  This patch
is just for adding the hook, so 'pcibios_disable_device()' is defined as a
null function on all architecture so far.
I tested this patch on i386, x86_64 and ia64.  But it has not been tested
on other architectures because I don't have these machines.
