I added these two calls to the pci API just for the case of partially
decoded hardware. The device driver for the hardware needs to make
these calls.
unsigned char *pci_map_rom_copy(struct pci_dev *dev, size_t *size);
Call this one from the driver when it is safe to read the ROM. It will
copy it and then provide a virtual address so that you can read it. The
copy is stored in the kernel so that the sysfs attribute will work
right.
void pci_remove_rom(struct pci_dev *dev);
Call this one from the driver to simply remove the ROM attribute.
Before the driver is loaded we have to assume that it safe to read the
ROM normally and the sysfs attribute will directly access the ROM.
unsigned char *pci_map_rom(struct pci_dev *dev, size_t *size);
For normal hardware that implements full decoding use this call. It
will automatically sort out the need to use the real ROM or a shadow
copy.
void pci_unmap_rom(struct pci_dev *dev, unsigned char *rom);
When you are done with a mapping use this
Normal ROMs do not make copies. The only time a copy happens is when a
device driver for a partially decoded device calls pci_map_rom_copy().
