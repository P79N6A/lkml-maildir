While i do not disagree with your research and resultant conclusions for 
the PXA255 processor i think it may not be as representative of some of 
the target systems we're interested in, that is, x86 (cringe, cringe). A 
number of i386 systems enter model defined partial suspend states when 
execution of the hlt instruction takes place, resuming from these suspend 
states draws more power for a short period of time thus doing this every 
millisecond is going to be detrimental to total power consumption over 
time. But this isn't only an i386 trait as other desktop/workstation 
processors are similar.
