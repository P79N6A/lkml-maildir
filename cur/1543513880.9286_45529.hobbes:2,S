Does anyone know how to restore a hard drive's partition table. I messed
it up, trying to put FreeBSD on hda, with Linux already on hdb. When I
run /sbin/lilo to install lilo on hda, I get the message.
[root@speedy jkacur]# /sbin/lilo
Added linux
Added linuxmine *
Device 0x0300: Invalid partition table, 1st entry
  3D address:     0/0/0 (-1)
  Linear address: 1/0/0 (0)
[root@speedy jkacur]# 
Anyone know what to do?
Thanks
