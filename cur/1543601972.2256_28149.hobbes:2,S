Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.9-ac13 - parse_options() in reiserfs still broken
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello!
I'm a bit disappointed that the bug with option parsing in reiserfs wasn't
fixed in 2.4.9-ac13.  It's a serious issue that prevents mounting
reiserfs partitions on system startup (except root partition).
Anyway, I'm using this opportunity to send a better patch.  The only
difference is that the faulty code has been actually identified and fixed
(do-while becomes while), not just worked around by a sanity check.
"pos" is initialized with "options", not NULL, because kgetopt()
effectively does it anyway, but the value of "pos" is now used earlier.
I also included fixes for the typos that I encountered while fixing and
testing my patch.
The patch has been tested by multiple mounting and unmounting a reiserfs
partition with specific (notail) and generic (ro) flags in different
combinations.
Simplification of kgetopt() is possible, but I'm intentionally avoiding
code changes other that the most urgent fix.
The patch is also available here:
