	There was the grand total of *ONE* user who was personally
impacted by the userspace API change (the two other, one was hit by a
bug, now fixed, one was hit because of kernel API change + external
driver). And I immediately proposed to postpone the change to a later
time.
	The people who contributed most to this tread were had not
experienced any breakage. I don't know what conclusion to reach from
that, and I don't understand why it took such proportions.
	Guessing the right time to deprecate an old API can be a trial
and error process. So, we just have to wait for the release of FC6...
