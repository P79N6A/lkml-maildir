It isnt about regions. The microcontroller talks a message protocol,
much the same actually as most power microcontroller seem to do. Its
just Sony also added other stuff to the protocol.
Taking the acpi lock looks like its a generic way to deal with this
situation. Its made more important because a few sony laptops actually
require ACPI to do pci/irq setup
