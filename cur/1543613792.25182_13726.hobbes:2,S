Then positive and negative sides should be gathered from their experiences
aswell, it can be good for the outcome to follow something that has

Therfore only trusted maintainers should have access. Normal deadly

Or even make a kernel-patches@vger.kernel.org address that would be
parsed manually of automaticly..
