That's not surprising.  The card is a PCI device, it's not connected to
the ISA bus.

By the way, I looked through your mails an I still don't quite understand
what the above is for.  I understand you are trying serial ISA interrupts
first.  What's the reason for that?  Do you know any device that needs
this?  I would prefer not to add any code unless it's known to be needed.
Any probe is potentially dangerous.  The known problems are with PCI
cards, which have PCI interrupts and don't need anything else.  I believe
laptops are engineered better and don't need any fixes.

Apparently you are enabling INTA.  Shouldn't you disable serial ISA
interrupts if they didn't work?
I also think you are using mfunc_old incorrectly.  Either it should be the
current value of irqmux, in which case you should change it when testing
serial ISA interrupts, or it's the initial value of irqmux, in which case
you shouldn't compare it to mfunc the second time.  You cannot have it
both ways.  Please create one more variable, e.g. mfunc_current.
