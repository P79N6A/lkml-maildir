Yes, that's a legitimate practical concern, IMO.
I guess many of the people who test -rc kernels have sufficient familarity
to know to disable this option, but a lot of the people who test major
releases do not.  So how about we mark PCI_MULTITHREAD_PROBE as broken in
2.6.19-rc6, then revert that change in 2.6.20-rc1, and keep doing that
until the feature is ready?
