If 20 pages of pdf documentation is undocumented, then we've raised the
bar a lot when it comes to documentation :-)
If you pull the blktrace tools, there's a README in there and if you
do a make docs it will generate a users manual for you.
I will update the in-kernel documentation, it does need a little work in
the Kconfig section. And I'll add a pointer to the user tool repo which
has a lot more info.
