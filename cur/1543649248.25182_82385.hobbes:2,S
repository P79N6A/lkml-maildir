This is fantastic.
This is one of the things I think the Linux kernel sorely lacks, both 
image-wise and practically-speaking.  Ted T'so maintained a bug list for 
a while, and it was (a) valuable and (b) way too much work for one human 
to possibly handle.

Again, fantastic.  As was discussed at the original Kernel Summit (and 
perhaps the latest one as well?), everyone knows we need a bug tracking 
system, but without humans to help keep the garbage bug reports to a 
minimum, the system won't be used by developers _or_ users with 
legitimate problems.

I certainly am.  Even though I claim to be net driver maintainer, I 
don't begin to claim that I can track and fix _all_ bugs in _all_ net 
drivers, even though I endeavor to do the best I can.
This Bugzilla system, I believe, should help a great deal.
I'm definitely willing to give it an honest shot with net drivers, and I 
hope that we can persuade others to do so as well.
One suggestion - it might be nice for IBM to register "linuxbugs.org" or 
bugzilla.kernel.org or similar, so to provide an additional impression 
of impartiality.  I don't mind "Hosted by IBM!" plastered all over the 
site, but if Bugzilla ever needs to move, that makes things much easier.
