Hi out there!
This is to let you know that I've just released the 0.2.0 version of the
Linux Encryption HOWTO at its homepage
http://marc.mutz.com/Encryption-HOWTO/.
Changes against 0.1.0 include:
o Added generic section on VPNs; (new)
o Added CIPE section; (major extension)
o Updated Int. Kernel Patch discussion to 2.2.13.3; (minor modification)
o Removed "Release Notes" and a bit of section "I've got..."; (Tim, is
this enough?)
o Added warning on mount misbehaviour on looped remount-ro, fix by
Andries B. for util-linux will probably fail patch; (minor addition).
Please report also the littlest error you find, together with anythig
that needs more explanation (or less, btw.) to me: Marc@Mutz.com.
Also, I'd like to invite people interested in translating the document
to do so. Please let me know about it, so I can add links and tell
people whether someone else has already taken this task.
Thanks to everyone that sent corrections and suggestions to me.
Marc
