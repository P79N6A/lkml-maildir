Hello,
I am trying to compile a module that requires elv_requeue_request.
I include <linux/elevator.h>, but that fails. Now that elevator.h includes 
blkdev.h (to get at the reqeust_queue_t typedef -- see next post), 
blkdev.h wants elv_dequeue_request, but which is defined in elevator.h. 
This circular dependency is really a problem, does anyone have 
an adequate fix? 2.6.17.
