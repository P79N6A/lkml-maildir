Actually, it is not a promise controller.
Setup:
00:1f.1 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 82820 820 (Camino 2) Chipset IDE U100
(rev 02)
Device Model:     IC35L040AVER07-0
Symptoms are the same, though.

Hhmm. I have not changed anything major on that machine except the
Kernel for years. Only after upgrading from 2.4.23 to 2.4.25, I got
these problems. 
If there is no problem with the kernel, I have to assume a hardware
failure of some kind. Badblocks/smartlog reveal no errors.
