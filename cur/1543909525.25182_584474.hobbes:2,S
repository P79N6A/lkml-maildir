The above message indicates that you went off the top of the cpuset
hierarchy w/o finding a non-empty intersection with
node_states[N_HIGH_MEMORY].  The top cpuset should include all nodes
with memory--and there has to be at least one, right?.  See
cpuset_init_smp().  That would indicate that node_states[N_HIGH_MEMORY]
was empty when cpuset_init_smp() was called or when you entered
guarantee_online_mems().  One can't tell because you didn't include the
"at top" message [are you seeing it?] and node_state() always returns
true for node zero on non-NUMA platforms [!(MAX_NUMANODES > 1)].
If you're still investigating, I'd suggest a printk in
cpuset_init_smp().  And use node_isset() directly, instead of
node_state.  Or you can really look beneath the covers of nodemask_t and
print 'node_states[N_HIGH_MEMORY].bits[0]' using a hex format.  
I should note that this works on my ia64 NUMA platform and other folks'
x86_64 platforms.  So, it's looking like an i386 specific issue.

Should just do the structure assignment, right?  That's used pretty
heavily throughout the mem policy and cpuset sources.  
Hmmm, including to initialize the top cpuset's mems_allowed.  If that
assignment failed, as well, it might indicate that the compiler is
having difficulty handling the indexed array of structs?  
Try the patch below to see if the changes the behavior.  I didn't change
all of the struct assignments.  Just the ones involving the indexed
node_state array element.

Uh, no.  you're using it correctly.  But as I mentioned above, for
MAX_NUMANODES <= 1, node_state() just does "return node == 0;"  Better
to use node_isset() directly for this case.

===========================================================
PATCH -- use memcpy() for node_state[] assignment
to see if this fixes the i386 cpusets empty mems_allowed 
problem.
N.B., compile-tested only on ia64.
