Well, if they were sure they could never get any benefit by reiser4
they wouldn't be testing it in the first place...
But certainly the fact they're testing it, doesn't mean they're
actually going to use it forever. You can monitor the 35 users live
with this link and to see if they increase or decrease over time ;)

They're ordered by cumulative uptime and not by the number of
users. For example there are only 10 jfs users but those 10 jfs users
have a much larger average uptime (59 days) so they score much higher
in the cumulative uptime too. Why the average reiser4 uptime is much
lower is unknown, it could be because they shutdown the system by
night, or because they upgrade kernel so frequently, or because the
system crashes.
