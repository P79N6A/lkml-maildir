	There are pains here, though.  On every submit, you have to walk
the entire vector just to know what did or did not complete.  I've seen
this in other APIs (eg, async_result would be -EAGAIN for lack of
resources to start this particular fibril).  Userspace submit ends up
always walking the array of submissions twice - once to prep them, and
once to check if they actually went async.  For longer lists of I/Os,
this is expensive.
