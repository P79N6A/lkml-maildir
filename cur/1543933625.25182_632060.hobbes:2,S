Subject: [RFC][PATCH 1/7] Suspend: Introduce open() and close() callbacks
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/27/69

From: Rafael J. Wysocki <rjw@sisk.pl>
On ACPI systems the target state set by acpi_pm_set_target() is
reset by acpi_pm_finish(), but that need not be called in the
suspend fails.  For this reason, we need an additional global suspend
callback that will reset the target state regardless of whether or
not the suspend is successful.  Also, it is reasonable to rename the
.set_target() global suspend callback, since it will be used for a
different purpose on ACPI 1.0x systems.
Introduce the global suspend callback .close() to be executed at the
end of the suspend sequence and rename the .set_target() global
suspend callback to .open().
