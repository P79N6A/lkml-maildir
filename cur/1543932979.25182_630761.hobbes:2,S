Just for curiosity... yep, I understand now you have everything written
in assembler, but why not consider start writing it in C and stop
doing the compiler work (such as pipelining, out of order reordering,
loop unrolling for specific processor, and so on...)
That's what everyone taught me, nowadays you won't be better than the
compiler in anything longer than three lines...
