Technically, yes; Lilo and the 2.2.x kernels handle serial port
console.  However, AFAIK no distributions actually have their installs set
up to use the serial port.  As you mentioned, though, Solaris supports
this along with all the BSD's and most other major Unices.
Your options will probably be to either make your own custom boot
disks, bug your favorite distro maintainer, or roll your own (or, of
course, through a video card, monitor, and keyboard on the PeeCee).
