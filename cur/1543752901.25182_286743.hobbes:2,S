Okay - sorry about that - will respond inline.

I believe the below illustrates the problem that will be seen without
volatile.
int g;
funct1()
{
	g = 0;
	while (g == 0) ;
	printf("here\n");
}
funct2()
{
	g = 1;
}
If funct1 and funct2 are executed either by different processes on the same
processor (which is the case for relayfs as we have per-processor buffers),
or across processors, and if g is not marked volatile, then if a process
gets into funct1, does the first line, gets interrupted, funct2 executes,
then funct1 continues, funct1 will never get out of the while loop.  If
however g is marked volatile then it will get out of the loop.  Is this not
true?  If we agree that in this case g needs to be marked volatile there
are now two choices.  Either mark it volatile in the declaration or
while(g==0) barrier(); If I understand it correctly barrier() invalidates
all current register values and forces a reload from memory.

Yes we can remove the code and use the standard atomic calls, but based on
the above example, I think we need to mark a couple variables volatile.  Do
you agree, if so, and unless there's dissenting opinion we can make the
change.
Thanks.
