fwiw, I have the same observation moving from 2.6.5-mm4 -> 2.6.6 on a
gentoo machine... On the observations side, i can add that it not
only fails to smoothly follow the track it should, but it seems it's
back to its old bad behavior of randomly jumping to the top-right
corner of the screen... :-(
Oh, and this is on a Dell L400 with synaptics touchpad, but using the
external ps/2 port to a "normal" mouse... No USB involved...
