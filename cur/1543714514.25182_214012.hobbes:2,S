    But then, why it depends on ISA support?
    BTW, in the case of my printer, the log says:
parport0: PC-style at 0x378 (0x778), irq 7 [PCSPP,TRISTATE]
lp0: using parport0 (interrupt-driven).
lp0: console ready
    The question is that my parallel port is configured as EPP, using
DMA 3, not as SPP, and I'm not sure if the problem is on the kernel,
the motherboard or if it is a simple matter of notation and the port
is being properly detected. My /proc/sys/dev/parport says
PCSPP,TRISTATE, not EPP... But DMA channel, IRQ line and IO addresses
are being correctly detected, so this doesn't seem a problem of PnP.

    So if I don't want ISA support in my kernel I must go with PNP OS
set to 'no' and let the BIOS do the work, am I right?

    Cool :)) Thanks for the information.
