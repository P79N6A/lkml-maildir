A small ext3 update.  It fixes a few hard-to-hit but potentially
serious problems.  The patch is against 2.4.18-pre3, and is also
applicable to 2.4.17.

0.9.17  12 Jan 2002
-------------------
- Cleanup from Manfred Spraul which provides better randomisation of inode
  generation numbers.
- A locking fix which prevents possible panics when an application is
  using ioctl(FIBMAP) against a loaded filesystem.
- Buffer locking fix for journal descriptor buffers - fixes the
  "end_request: buffer-list destroyed" crash which can occur under
  heavy VM load.
- Fix a buffer locking problem which could cause corruption if a process
  is reading from the underlying block device while journal recovery is
  in progress.
