No no no.  Just because you are using the firmware interface, does not
mean you need to add this extra round-trip to the whole system.  Just
dump the firmware to the /sys/firmware/whatever... file whenever you
want to, that's all that is needed.  No hotplug stuff, no filename
stuff, just a simple copy.
Also, see the -mm tree for a change in the way the sysfs attributes
work, that will keep you from having to do the .type stuff all over the
place.
thanks,
