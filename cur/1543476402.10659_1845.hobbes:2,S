Subject: Broken aic7xxx SCSI Probe - 2.2.0-pre[56]

Kernels 2.2.0-pre[56] fail to probe my SCSI chain at bootup.  This works
properly on 2.0.36 and 2.2.0-pre[14].  Controller is a narrow 2940 PCI.
Here is what I have on the chain:
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: FUJITSU  Model: M1606S-512       Rev: 6226
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00
  Vendor: MATSHITA Model: CD-R   CW-7502   Rev: 4.10
  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 02 Lun: 00
  Vendor: NEC      Model: CD-ROM DRIVE:465 Rev: 1.03
  Type:   CD-ROM                           ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 05 Lun: 00
  Vendor: WangDAT  Model: Model 3400DX     Rev: 1.5a
  Type:   Sequential-Access                ANSI SCSI revision: 02
I am OK on 2.2.0-pre4, but cannot progress further.  On 2.2.0-pre[56] I
see the Fujitsu drive probed repeatedly on boot, with SCSI bus errors
after each probe.
BTW, This setup has been running fine for two years with no hiccups on
"stable" kernel distributions.  This is not a termination issue.  :-)
Only thing I can think of which would make my system "special" is the
Fujitsu drive is not partitioned.  (I just have a filesystem on top of
the raw device) Does anyone else see something similar?  I did not see
any related bug reports on the LinuxHQ mailing list archives, hence this
post.  Am I out in the weeds or something?
Config files, logs, and whatever else needed on request.
