I think that lack of distinguishing poiwer is more serious for 
directories. The more I think I think about it, the more I wonder whether 
Solaris did things right - having a special operation to "cross the 
boundary".
I suspect Solaris did it that way because it's a hell of a lot easier to 
do it like that, but regardless, it would solve the issue of real 
directories having both real children _and_ the "extra streams".
