Have you observed problems with this, or just suspected trouble?
When I wrote this code, I looked at other code doing the same
and assumed it was ok, because usb_control_msg waits for the
DMA to complete before returning.
Is the problem only on systems that have noncoherent DMA, or
something else?

I was about to say that you should have Cc:'d me, but then I noticed
that I'm not listed in the driver as maintainer, nor in the MAINTAINERS
file, so I can't really complain here ;-)
