Two superblocks, one keeping a reference to another.  Filesystem driver is,
of course, the single piece of code, with common locking.  There's no need
to have the common struct super_block for that and no benefit in doing so -
only extra complications.  You can easily register two filesystem types
in the same driver and have ->get_sb() for your metadata fs parse its
arguments in any way it likes.  E.g. by doing pathname lookup on what would
normally be a device name and seeing if its on a filesystem of the primary
type; if it is - grab a reference to struct super_block of that fs
and work with it.
