This should always be pursued. Unnecessary code does infact still exist
inside the kernel, and if a bug should find it's way in there it would
both be annoying for developers and dangerous for end-users.

Readability should always be an issue, since the amount of documentation
and how easy a newbie can find his/her way through the sources is really
important for Linux. The easier it is to understand the code, the more
people will get involved in kernel developing in the end. It also sends
a message of professionality to have clean code which is consistant and
solid. From personal experience, I have become quite worried and paranoid
about the Linux kernel and software in general since I began reading LKML
and following up bugs, since issues like this do exist. Not that I have
ever had any real problems at all with the kernel, but knowing that a
lot of the code is unmaintained and erroneous takes away some of the
feeling of stability and security that the initial impression of Linux
gave me. Not that this has much to do with actual developing, but since
I am not a developer, I think I speak for most end-users who dig a little
deeper than desktop usage of Linux.

Warnings can infact be the problems with the compiler, and not errors
in the code itself. In some cases the programmers do the right thing,
and the compiler-programmers has to adjust to what infact is the right
thing to do. With this being said, warnings _are_ annoying. Someone
ought to categorize different types of warnings and only remove the
ones that everyone (or someone with authority) agrees is safe to
correct. Removing warnings just for the fun of it might not always
be the way to go.

Most maintainers would benefit from these patches in the end, no
matter how annoying it is to read through them at first. It is a
kernel janitor job, but even the "important" and busy developers
should care about these things. Nobody wants a messy kernel, so
a cleanup process like this would probably be appreciated from most
people.

Indeed, it's not fun to do something that no-one appreciates, so a
rally like this might be necessary to get people to notice that a
project like this is going down. Posting cleanup-patches once a week
to LKML is probably not the way to go, since most of them will be
ignored and/or flamed.
Great initiative, Jesper. Cleanups are needed too. Being a fan of
cleanliness and neat code I suggest you go ahead if people seem
to care about these things.
