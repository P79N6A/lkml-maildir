Not sure if this has anything to do with anything, I was thinking it's
something I've done wrong in setup, but thought I would let you know in this
light.  Other then this, 2.2.2 works like a dream for me, I'm still using
the userspace daemon for nfs.
2.2.2 stock, i386 system.  Trying to load nfsd.o module I get this error:
cafe:bash# insmod -k lockd
cafe:bash# insmod -k sunrpc
cafe:bash# insmod -k nfsd
/lib/modules/2.2.2/fs/nfsd.o: unresolved symbol do_nfsservctl
