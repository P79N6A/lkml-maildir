+ Summary:
Getting repeated badness in local_bh_enable messages in syslog.
+ Description:
Here's a sample output from dmesg:
Badness in local_bh_enable at kernel/softirq.c:121
Call Trace:
 [<c01241f9>] local_bh_enable+0x89/0x90

 [<c012f7c0>] worker_thread+0x0/0x260
 [<c01092a5>] kernel_thread_helper+0x5/0x10
+ Environment
Linux 2.6.3 vanilla from kernel.org
LIRC patch from <
http://flameeyes.web.ctonet.it/downloads.html#lirc>
I searched the archives and got a few lines here and there talking about
PPP problems giving rise to similar messages. However, I'm not using PPP
at all, and was having no such messages till 2.6.2. There were also some
messages talking about IrDA issues, and I am using IrDA (which works fine).
If this indeed is an IrDA problem, where can I find patches to fix it.
If not, what else could be the problem?
Thanks
