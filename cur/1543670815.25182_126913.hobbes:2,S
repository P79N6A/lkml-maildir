Well, today my workstation with 2.4.21-rc1 has two crashes - freezes - only
blank screen. I have tried use sysrq - without successful. :(
Machine is: AMD K7 2000+ XP, 256 RAM, RedHat 9 (gcc 3.2 20020903), only ext2,
only IDE disks. It was happned in non grapihs mode, without any messages in
logs files. With 2.4.21-pre6 all was/is fine, so it is not hardware problem.
