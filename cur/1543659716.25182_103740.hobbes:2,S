It's displayed, just push the back button until you get to the root.
Soon it should be possible to turn such entries (automatically) into
menuconfig entries, so they are displayed in the menu window.
BTW label is maybe the wrong word, it's a user prompt. If there is none,
it can't be displayed of course.
