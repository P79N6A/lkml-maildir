Have a look at podfuk, which is exactly that.  It provides the vfs from
midnight commander as a filesystem, using the CODA kernel hooks.

I have done some work on that.  NFS is yucky -- you can't tell when
someone has finished reading a file, for example.  But it's very
widespread so the problem is interesting.
An older version of podfuk used the user space NFS server but apparently
that caused all sort of problems.  I think an NFS server designed for
the job addresses most of the problems, but I haven't finished writing
one yet...
