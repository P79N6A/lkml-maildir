Revision 1:
  Fix 64/32 bit ioctl problems.
Revision 2:
  Check the uptodate flag in sub-bios to see if there was an error.
  [Mike Christie]
Revision 3:
  Handle interrupts within suspend.
Revision 4:
  dm.c: Use wake_up() rather than wake_up_interruptible() with the
  eventq.
Revision 5:
  Log an error if the target has unknown target type, or zero length.
Revision 6:
  Correctly align the dm_target_spec structures during retrieve_status().
Revision 7:
  Clarify the comment regarding the "next" field in struct dm_target_spec. The
  "next" field has different behavior if you're performing a DM_TABLE_STATUS
  command than it does if you're performing a DM_TABLE_LOAD command.
  See populate_table() and retrieve_status() in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c for more
  details on how this field is used.
Revision 8:
  dm-ioctl.c::retrieve_status(): Prevent overrunning the ioctl buffer by
  making sure we don't call the target status routine with a buffer size limit
  of zero. [Kevin Corry, Alasdair Kergon]
Revision 9:
  Striped: Use an EMIT macro in the status function.
