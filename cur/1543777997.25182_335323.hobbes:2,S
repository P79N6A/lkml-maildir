I first thought about loading with a loop of md5sum /somedir, play a
wav, fetch a couple of webpages etc. But since the talk has been that
the powersave would come from CPU sleep between "ticks" (I know, I know,
it's not ticks) not having to wake up so often, I decided against a
load.

I won't do that unless heavily beaten ;-) The battery charge time is
2h10 minutes...
