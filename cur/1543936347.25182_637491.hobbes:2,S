Subject: [PATCH/RFC] synchronize_rcu(): high latency on idle system
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello folks,
I'd like to put the patch below out for comments to see if folks think the 
approach is a valid fix to reduce the latency of synchronize_rcu().  The 
motivation is that an otherwise idle system takes about 3 ticks per network 
interface in unregister_netdev() due to multiple calls to synchronize_rcu(), 
which adds up to quite a few seconds for tearing down thousands of 
interfaces.  By flushing pending rcu callbacks in the idle loop, the system 
makes progress hundreds of times faster.  If this is indeed a sane thing to, 
it probably needs to be done for other architectures than x86.  And yes, the 
network stack shouldn't call synchronize_rcu() quite so much, but fixing that 
is a little more involved.
