This patch has worked for me and is obvious enough that I haven't bothered 
to rewire my box to put the IBM drive back on the HPT366 - the lid's 
actually screwed on for once.
It adds all the IBM Deskstar 75GXP and 40GV drives to the HPT366's UDMA
mode 4 blacklist, forcing them to drop to mode 3, with which myself and
the one other tester who responded were unable to find problems.
IIRC the drives actually used in the testing were the 30GB and 45GB 75GXP
models - IBM-DTLA-3070{30,45}. I've blacklisted the 40GV models too with
this patch, just to be on the safe side. It's a reasonable assumption that
the IDE interfaces on the slower drives share the same compatibility
problems with the HPT366.
(And I've fixed the Pine bug which was stripping trailing whitespace and 
making my patches fail to apply too :)
