Subject: [DAC960] 2.6.0-test1: device files wrong in devfs

When I mount devfs in 2.6.0-test1 (and -bk2), I have the following 
DAC960-related files in /dev (actually, /mnt/dev) without devfsd:
/dev/part{1,2,5,6,7}
/dev/disc
/dev/discs/disc[0-31] (these 32 files are symlinks to "../")
I don't have a /dev/rd/ directory. All other files in /dev seem to be 
in the right place. The relevant lines from dmesg:
DAC960#0:     /dev/rd/c0d0: RAID-5, Online, 88442880 blocks, Write Back
devfs_mk_dir: invalid argument.<6> rd/c0d0: p1 p2 < p5 p6 p7 >
devfs_mk_dir: invalid argument.<4>devfs_mk_bdev: could not append to 
parent for /disc (this line shows up 31 times in a row)
AFAIK, the last correctly working kernel is 2.5.67. 2.5.68 doesn't 
work, however I don't know if that's because of the same problem.
My hardware:
Mylex ExtremeRAID 1100 (DAC1164P)
ALR Revolution 6x6 (Intel 450GX-based Pentium Pro mainboard)
6x Intel PII Overdrive CPU
4 GB mem
FWIW, the problem also occurs when I _don't_ enable highmem support.
