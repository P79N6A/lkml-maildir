Nope, they #include Linux header files - at least in their Linux version.
Even if one version does #include Unix headers, that does not mean
copyright to the rest of the code automatically belongs to the Unix
copyright holder.
And we're not even talking about source code; we're talking about
_binary modules_. Which do include object code which comes from GPLed
(inline) code; and are thus derived works.
