How did they manage to write a l/s only mutex on an Alpha ?
Or was it UP only ?
The memory consistency of Alpha is very weak and requires (AFAIK)
a memory barrier to implement a mutex)

PS: I do tend to think that a strong sequential consistency (even stronger
    than x86's) is the way to go performancewise.  Memory barriers are
    just too expensive.  Isn't MIPS sequentially consistent ?
