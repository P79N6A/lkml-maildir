Batching messages between processes can be good, but what percentage of the
time is this practical? In most robust applications you tend to need the
result of one step before you are sure what the next step is, due to errors,
etc. There are obvious exceptions. I could initiate a bunch of writes to
different places, and look at all the results in one go.
Message passing can work well if its embedded in the processor. The old
British GEC4000 minis did this. The ONLY way processes could communicate in
those was by message passing, and the microcoded message scheme was as fast
as a call. A message to or from an intelligent I/O card was just like a
message between CPU  processes, too - no need for interrupts.
The real performance issue isn't one of how communication takes place, but of
the total quantity of communication needed. Its just like any human activity.
You have one guy on a project, and add a second. What happens? Well, if each
can work largely in isolation, with limited need for interaction, you might
get nearly twice the output. If they need to communicate a lot you might get
less output than the first guy could produce on his own. The same is true in
the OS world, or with client/server. You need to minimise the chatting
(whether its by message passing, system call, or meetings), and maximise the
real work. If you ask someone to do something, make sure a concise request
produces a substantial reward.
