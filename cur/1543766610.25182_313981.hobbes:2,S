NVidia driver 7167 and 7174 work just fine with 2.6.12-rc2-mm3, at least for
some people. If it's not working for you, that's an NVidia problem, not a lkml
one.  If you need help, yell off-list and I'll see what I can do, or go to the
NVidia page the drivers are on, and follow the 'Forums' link - that's a *very*
good source for assistance and patches..
