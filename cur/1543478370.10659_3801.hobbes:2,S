When switching from pre7 to pre7ac5 my system crashed during boot on the
bttv detection/init thingies. I haven't exactly looked where it happened,
I tested pre7 which worked okay for me. I have a Miro PCTV (normal not
plus orso).
I will try and recompile it (maybe even with ac4 to see if it's in the fix
for the compilation) and catch the exact error (The normal screens full
off debugging 'garbage'.
Maybe you have an idea what causes this bt848 chipset. Maybe some weird
rewritings that happened in ac1.
