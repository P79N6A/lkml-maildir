Thank you. It looks as though the bkbugs stuff expected the list of
interested parties in a different syntax; when I added my findings, it
complained about the real names in that list, such as "user Jochen not
found" or something like that. Looks like it's not RFC-822 "To:" header
syntax but just a set of mail addresses.
