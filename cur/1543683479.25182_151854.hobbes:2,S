   Real-time stuff is a must - something like RTAI.
   Things like Linux Trace Toolkit - soone or later you have to start 
using them to tune performace.
   Patches to remove mandatory (for 2.2/2.0) PCI/IDE support were pretty 
common too.
   Patch to shrink network hashes - norm of life.
   Patch to kill PCI names database.
   And this is only things I was using personally (and I remember about) 
in my short 4 years carrier.
   CONFIG_TINY - 
http://lwn.net/Articles/14186/
 - got something like 
this merged? - so I'm the first guy in the download queue on ftp.kernel.org!
   Kernel heavily tuned for servers and workstations (read - modern PCs).
   At my previous position company was using kernel prepared by Karim 
Yaghmour and right now we using kernels from MontaVista.
   Far from vanillas.
 > embedded people complaining

   For some reasons all "improvements" to kernel had lead to increase of 
kernel size, not decrease. Strange, isn't it?
