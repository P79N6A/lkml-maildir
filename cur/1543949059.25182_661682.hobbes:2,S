Do we know that for sure?

In my initial reply, I pointed out one example where users *may* care:
NPTL uses RLIMIT_STACK to determine the size of per-thread stacks.  It
is conceivable that users might want to set RLIMIT_STACK < 512k, and
that would have the effect of lowering the amount of space for
argv+eviron below what the kernel has historically guaranteed.  That's
an ABI change, though it's unclear whether it would impact anyone in
practice.
