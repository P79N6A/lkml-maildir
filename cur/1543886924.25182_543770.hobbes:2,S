I think you mean "non Amercian". The majority of the human race don't
speak English, and you could probably make a good case that kernel tree
should be in Chinese, Spanish or Gujerati by your logic.

I find your comments racist and insulting. I trust you will be
apologizing. The most clear example of where it would be polite to
include names spelt properly are the Asian countries. They may well (and
most do) choose to include a transliteration.
Western European names you can generally transliterate quite well
(although conventions are not simple and you don't usually simply omit
accent marks), in some cases you also completely break the naming
in the eyes of a native speaker because the pronunciation implied is now
all wrong.
