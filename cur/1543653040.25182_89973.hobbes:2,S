I've noticed some oddities on 2.4.19 with a dual Athlon Tyan S2462 that
look like stalls under heavy load.  If you're really curious, you might
try 2.4.18, as this was not a problem there. (I'm running SuSE kernels
shipped with SuSE 8.0 and 8.1, although I saw similar trouble with a
stock 2.4.19 build and stopped using it.  The stalls are only minor
though, so I haven't investigated.  Maybe they are worse on that
motherboard.)
