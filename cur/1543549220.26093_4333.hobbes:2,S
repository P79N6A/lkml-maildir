No other filesystem driver has a built-in man page. HPFS is already
documented in mount.8, so there is no need to use kernel memory to
store additional documentation.
Of course, cscope still looks like a security hazard. One just needs
to sneak a buffer-overflow exploit patch past Linus. I'll guess that
this can be fixed by building cscope with flex in place of lex, not
that I've actually looked at the source though.
