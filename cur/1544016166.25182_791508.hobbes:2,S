I've managed to get at some values that look suspiciously like the UOC 
register space, and they seem to be OK.
Here is the full description of what I did, so that google can slurp this 
information up for others to use in the future. First things first, the AMD 
Geode CS5536 Companion Device Data Book is a necessary resource, and tells us 
where the the UOC-related MSR lives, how big the UOC register space is, and 
what all the bits mean.
Armed with this data, we first grab the UOC MSR:
[root@hurricane ~]# modprobe msr
[root@hurricane ~]# rdmsr 0x5120000B
aefa06000
We note the UOC base address value, which, according to the data book, is in 
bits 31:8 of the MSR. Using this information and a few more looks into the 
data book, we get the following kernel code:
#define UOC_REGISTERS_ADDR 0xEFA06000
#define UOC_REGISTERS_SIZE 0x0100
struct uoc_registers {
	u32 cap;
	u32 mux;
	u32 reserved;
	u32 ctl;
} __attribute__((packed));
static void observe_uoc_registers(void)
{
	struct uoc_registers __iomem *uoc;
	if (!request_mem_region(UOC_REGISTERS_ADDR,
				UOC_REGISTERS_SIZE,
				"amd5536uoc")) {
		printk(KERN_INFO "amd5536uoc mem region already used\n");
		goto finish;
	}
	uoc = ioremap_nocache(UOC_REGISTERS_ADDR,
			      UOC_REGISTERS_SIZE);
	if (uoc == NULL) {
		printk(KERN_INFO "amd5536uoc io memory cannot be mapped\n");
		goto release;
	}
	printk(KERN_INFO "amd5536uoc cap=0x%08X\n", readl(&uoc->cap));
	printk(KERN_INFO "amd5536uoc mux=0x%08X\n", readl(&uoc->mux));
	printk(KERN_INFO "amd5536uoc ctl=0x%08X\n", readl(&uoc->ctl));
	iounmap(uoc);
release:
	release_mem_region(UOC_REGISTERS_ADDR,
			   UOC_REGISTERS_SIZE);
finish:
	printk(KERN_INFO "amd5536uoc observation finished\n");
}
Put a call to observe_uoc_registers() at the top of udc_pci_probe(), rebuild, 
modprobe the amd5536udc driver, and observe the data. Namely, the values that 
came back, as well as their interpreted meanings according to the data book, 
are:
cap=0x000083EA
	The host power control bits affect USB_PWR_EN1 for ports 1-3.
	The host power control bits affect USB_PWR_EN2 for port 4.
	Port power enabled with output of 1 on USB_PWR_EN1 and USB_PWR_EN2.
	No overcurrent reporting.
	Automatic pull-up (APU) is enabled.
mux=0x00000003
	The muxed port is assigned to the device controller.
ctl=0x00000083
	The muxed port is assigned to the device controller.
	The comparator circuitry for VBUS detection (PADEN) is enabled.
The mystery deepens. :)
