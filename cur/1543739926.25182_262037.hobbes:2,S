you can split up this assertion into
 - drop_count != 0
 - cleanup_ret != 0
and fail on that (or just output those values
before you panic) ... this might give some
deeper insight into the issue ...

yeah, probably not, I think the vserver changes 
just make the oops more likely (or simply the 
increased load does)

maybe until it gets fixed, mounting the ext3
without journal might help here?
