It has been tried; in fact Intel did implement this in their "Linux PXE 
SDK".  The UNDI API is absolutely atrocious, however, being based on 
NDIS2 which is widely considered the worst of all the many network 
stacks for DOS.
Additionally, many UNDI stacks don't work correctly when called from 
protected mode, since the interface doesn't work right.  Additionally, 
UNDI is *ONLY* available after booting from the NIC.
