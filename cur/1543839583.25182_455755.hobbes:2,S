I haven't seen the new definition of "bool", but it can't possibly provide 
a strong distinction between integers and booleans.  That is, if x is 
declared as an integer rather than as a bool, the compiler won't complain 
about "if (x) ...".

How about add_work_to_q() instead of queue_work() and add_work() instead
of schedule_work()?
