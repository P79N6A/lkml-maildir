Would it be OK for you if I add the mount-time check for iocharset=utf8 to 
the fat filesystem and silently replace this with the "utf8" option, instead 
of overly actively warning the users? This way, the sysfs option and the 
nls_base.iocharset module parameter will still work as I want.

Yes. This is because I have some files with non-ASCII names in my home 
directory. Changing the locale would make these filenames look wrong until I 
change it back.
