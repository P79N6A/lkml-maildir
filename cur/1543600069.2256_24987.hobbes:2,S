    I am interested in opinions that people might have on how to quote
    special characters in filenames in files in /proc.
    Is there any convention already used in some other part of the
    kernel?
/proc/mounts does what mount does - it uses octal escapes:
# mount /dev/sr0 "/a b" -r -t iso9660
# mount | tail -1
/dev/sr0 on /a b type iso9660 (ro)
# cat /proc/mounts | tail -1
/dev/sr0 /a\040b iso9660 ro 0 0
