hehe.  Here's a salient point:
native block drivers are typically used in one of two ways:  creating a 
whole subsystem (ide, scsi), or servicing a single host (dac960).
I am doing the first:  creating a whole subsystem.  The infrastructure 
involved in that, over and above what block already provides, is that 
part I dread coding.
If I am to code that, I want to do so ONCE.  And that means a 
bus-agnostic /dev/{disk,cdrom,tape}.  Not /dev/{ad,acd,at,ag}.
