Thanks for this. (Btw you might want to Cc me on such mails, I read
both list and personal mails, but you'll get way better response time.)

Hmm, I did not realize this difference. Doing these hacks with LRU
seems pretty crazy to me...
Would it be possible to stop processes when they try to manipulate
LRU, instead?

It better should be. If it is not true, then kill -STOP -1 does not
work, and that would be a kernel bug, right?
When user thread is stopped, it should better not hold any lock,
because otherwise we have problem anyway.
Kernel threads are different, and each must be handled separately,
maybe even with some ordering. But there's relatively small number of
kernel threads...

I agree it can take longer, but modulo bugs, it should be always possible.

Exactly, you slowed down critical paths of kernel... This makes patch
big, ugly, and is bad idea.

Adding hooks to "fast" stuff like read()/write()/open is no-no. Adding
small number of hooks to slower stuff like exec()/exit() might be
acceptable. Could you get away with that?
