No. SPF neglected existing SMTP practice when it was invented, the
typical sign of something engineered without respect for realities. It
has since been given a crutch named SRS, but it still can't walk. And
rather than fixing the SPF/SRS/... problems, their disciples advocate it
and tell all the world it needs to change.
Quite overstating their own importance I'd say.

Your suspicions are irrelevant, and thanks goodness neither Wong nor

A forwarded email conveys the same message as the originator sent,
it's a long way from being a new message. The time of monks copying
books is long past.

I am controlling the forwarding system, and you aren't going to take it
away from me.

Right, <twisting your words> SPF should be fixed.
