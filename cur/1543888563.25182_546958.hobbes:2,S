Sorry, I'm not convinced by this...
If we want to stick to more understanable, established ways,
why don't we use a global lock (not per cpu but per work or
per workqueue) for insert_work(), which would be really the
simplest construct here. Probably because some compromise is
needed. On the other hand many locks could be replaced with
elaborate constructs with atomic operations like this. But
for some reasons this usually isn't done.
IMHO it's better to get used to barriers, because, as seen
in this thread, even after finding better solution, the
problem of execution ordering didn't disappear. Another
"strange" question is: if these barriers are so tough, why
Oleg managed to do them seemingly right from the very first
time? But even if he would do some error here, I think it
should be easier to check for this one problem only, than to
risk the "stability" of the whole algorithm by changing more.
Of course now, after the time was spent anyway, this new
"old-way" is more attractive.

I prefer simplicity over perfomance too. But there is a
question of price... These modern things like RCU or barriers
are unavoidable, and probably we should get used to think the
ALPHA is right and 'normal' here - not x86 (by limiting
compilers and programmers with making the most of all those
new caches).

Yes, the good thing is Oleg can choose between two good
solutions here! (I don't envy him...)
Thanks for your response, sorry for my delay &
