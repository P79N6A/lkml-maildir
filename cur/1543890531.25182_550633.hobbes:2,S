Well, what I wanted to describe is that CONFIG_RANDOM_INVISIBLE_THING
can be referenced _outside_ the particular subsys, and then it
breaks right on the spot -- some easier to find thanks to compile
failure, or a link failure, others may remain hidden until runtime.
A misplacement of invisible objects, I'd say, but that is another
story, another day, another patch perhaps.
