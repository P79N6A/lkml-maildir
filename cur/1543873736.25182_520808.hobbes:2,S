Subject: [PATCH] EHCI: add delay to bus_resume before accessing ports
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This patch (as870) adds a delay to ehci-hcd's bus_resume routine.
Apparently there are controllers and/or BIOSes out there which need
such a delay to get the ports back into their correct state.  This
fixes Bugzilla #8190.

This is for 2.6.20-stable.  Earlier kernels aren't so eager to suspend 
EHCI buses and so don't need this fix.
