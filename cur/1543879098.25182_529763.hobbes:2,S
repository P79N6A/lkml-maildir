Applied with some common sense - yes.
if --endif blocks has been used in several places to make dependencies consistent.
When cleaning up the net part I recall a few places where the explicit dependency
was missing causing 1) dependencies to be wrong and 2) caused indention in menu-
config to be wrong.
But yet agin do not go and replace all dependencies with if--endif blocks.
They shall be used with some good taste.
