But if so, SuS is _very_ _very_ wrong.
The fact is, if you use something like vm86 mode, you absolutely _need_
to be able to explicitly mmap at address 0. 
So it is correct (and in fact there is no other sane way to do it) to
say
	addr = mmap(NULL, 1024*1024,
		PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE ,
		MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_FIXED,
		-1, 0);
and if SuS says that mmap must not return NULL for this case, then SuS
is so full of sh*t that it's not worth worrying about.
In short, under Linux 0 _is_, and will always be (at least on x86) a
perfectly valid return address from mmap() and friends. It's only going
to be returned when you explicitly ask for it with MAP_FIXED, but it
absolutely is a valid return.
