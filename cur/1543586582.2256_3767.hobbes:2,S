Actually, I had to use a search engine to find a
tangentially related howto that halfway through
mentioned something in passing which gave me a clue of
something else to search for that, it turns out,
didn't work anyway.  (getsockname() in 2.2 returns the
original destination ip, but not the original
destination port.  I had to move to
2.4/netfilter/getsockopt to get that piece of
information.)
And the reason I didn't ask on the netfilter list is I
was originally trying to use 2.2 ipchains, not 2.4
iptables.  Didn't think the old stuff was on-topic
there.

It still requires pretty good forensic investigation
skills to make it work...
