Subject: [PATCH 001 of 4] md: Fix innocuous bug in raid6 stripe_to_pdidx
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

stripe_to_pdidx finds the index of the parity disk for a given
stripe.
It assumes raid5 in that it uses "disks-1" to determine the number
of data disks.
This is incorrect for raid6 but fortunately the two usages cancel each
other out.  The only way that 'data_disks' affects the calculation of
pd_idx in raid5_compute_sector is when it is divided into the
sector number.  But as that sector number is calculated by multiplying
in the wrong value of 'data_disks' the division produces the right
value.
So it is innocuous but needs to be fixed.
