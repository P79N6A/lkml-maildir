Edit your /etc/fstab and remove the line for devfs. You don't
need/want that if you have CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT=y.

I know nothing about grub. Somehow, you need to pass "devfs=dall" to
the kernel when booting. And I need to see the boot messages when this
option is given to the kernel. If it's too verbose, you can try
"devfs=dreg,dunreg,dfree" instead. Copy the messages down by hand if
you need to, but I need to see them. Do yourself a favour and set up a
serial console so you can capture boot messages easily.
Also, make sure you are not using any proprietary drivers (like
NVidia). If you have such drivers, move them to another directory to
prevent their being loaded. Even if you load but don't use such
drivers, they still make debugging information unreliable.
I've had a look at the code, and I see no reason for devfs to fail in
this way, unless some driver is abusing it.
