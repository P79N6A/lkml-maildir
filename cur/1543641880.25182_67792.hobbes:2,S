   Admit it, you never wrote a line of lisp ;-)
Oh contraire:
;;  The most important function in this file. Use it wisely.
(defun grrr (object)
  "Growl at OBJECT"
  (interactive "sWhat are you mad at: ")
  (if (equal object "")
      (message "You growl at %s" (buffer-name))
    (message "You growl at %s" object)))
(defun xyzzy () (interactive) (message "nothing happens"))
;;  Defun needed for rmail growling hack below.

(defun growl-at-from ()
  "Search for from header in mail and growl at that person"
  (save-excursion
    (save-excursion
      (goto-char 0)
      (let ((case-fold-search t))

	(end-of-line)
	(setq end-of-from-string (point))

we growl at whoever the mail is from.  Pretty crufty eh?"
