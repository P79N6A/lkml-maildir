As far as I can read the code
(not too far actually, so correct
me please), we have a per-process
IO bitmap copy, which gets copied
into a per-cpu TSS upon a task switch.
That means that you are right about the
overhead, but at the same time I see
nothing that keeps us from a dynamic
memory allocation for the per-process
copy, as soon as an ioperm() is called.
Is this possible?

Well, at least I think that the VESA
driver of X also uses v86 for the video
bios invocations. It doesn't sucks as badly
as dosemu does probably because even using
vm86(), they still can keep IOPL==3, dosemu
can't. So I think that would still be an
improvement, probably not so noticeable as
it could be for dosemu, but still.

What if we treat dosemu not as a single
program, but as all that progs that can
work under it and require VESA?:)

By any means I am not going to pollute the
memory by a useless per-process IO bitmap
copies. As we have a per-cpu TSS (thanks for
the hint, Denis), we'd have bloat only on a
per-process copies, but I wonder if it is
possible to avoid them except for the processes
that require it?
I wouldn't ask so much and just try the things
out, but for the one thing: what must be done,
besides increasing the IO_BITMAP_SIZE const of a
processor.h, in order to get the larger IO bitmap
right now? As I want to experement a bit, I
need to get it large at first, no matter how much
memory will it eat. But how can I do even that?
