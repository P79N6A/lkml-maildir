2.4.8 is just dandy on most (6xx/7xx/74xx) PPCs.  The default config won't
compile because of one of the IDE options (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_SL82C105), but
aside from that, it's good.

Just Alan picking up what Paul sends to linux-kernel.

2.4.8 vs the PPC tree at the time was very close.  Hopefully 2.4.10 will be
as well.

4xx support hasn't worked in the 'stable' trees for a while.  It's finally
being caught up in the '2_4_devel' tree.  See
