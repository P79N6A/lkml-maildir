   Then the power fails before the SCSI drive
   can flush its embedded cache.

Oops, but only for the drive manufacturer.  Last I checked nearly all
scsi disk manufacturers which used a cache design where this would
matter, have a mechanism which keeps enough charge around such that at
the event of a power loss to the disk the cache will be flushed in
time within some large margin of error.
