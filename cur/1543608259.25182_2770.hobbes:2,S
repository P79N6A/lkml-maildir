I believe the idea of having a more precise nr_pages value can make a 
difference. We are trying to estimate if swapping is needed, which is 
pretty expensive. If we can avoid it by more accurately knowing what  
is really going on (without _too_ much costs) we can only win.        
                                                                      
Regards,                                                              
Stephan
