Why?  The neatest thing about the whole file-as-a-directory mechanism is
that it avoids adding these sorts of dependencies.  From a backup and
administration point of view, I'd actually think it would be an
advantage to maintain stat information for things like ACL control
subfiles separately from the main data file, if we chose to put ACL
stuff into subfiles like that.  (Sun are going down exactly this road
with Solaris, btw.)
By making the interface as simple as possible and avoiding such
dependencies, we probably make the whole API more general-purpose.
