Back from the Scottish Hogmanay celebrations now. :)  I've run my
normal tests on this (based mainly on timing tests which show up
exactly how much is being written to disk for 1000 iterations of
various fsync/fdatasync/O_SYNC and overwrite/append combinations) and
2.4.0-prerelease seems to be doing the Right Thing.
My standard tests for this don't cover msync --- do you want me to
give that a try too?
