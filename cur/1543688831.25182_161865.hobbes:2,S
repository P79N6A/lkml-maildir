That's wrong.  If a platform needs to, it should properly
align the mapping when MAP_SHARED is used on a file.
If you look in arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sparc.c, you'll see
that when we're mmap()'ing a file and MAP_SHARED is specified,
we align things to SHMLBA.
If userspace purposefully violates this alignment attempt,
then it's at it's own peril to keep the mappings coherent,
there is simply nothing the kernel should be doing to help
out that case.
