It seems to only crash reliably when I pull a file off the filesystem
that's on the lv, but I haven't been at all scientific in determining
that.  =)  I'll try to kill it without LVM being in the picture.

Yes.  Still crashes under the same conditions with the 'eth0: Abnormal
interrupt' bit, but the oops might be very different.  I'll try to get 
an oops with a vanilla kernel...
