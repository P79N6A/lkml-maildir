Hang on - reading again, I wonder if the main reason he didn't like
kqueue is because it allowed for multiple event queues
(so libraries don't need to be tightly integrated into
the main program, for instance).  He preferred one queue
and callbacks.
However, I think Linus admitted later on that nobody liked his
callback idea, so maybe he'd be receptive to the multiple
event queue idea now.
Um, I assume Ben's aio stuff allows multiple completion queues, right?
