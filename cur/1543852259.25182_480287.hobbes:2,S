So I tested your latest set of patches on the Vaio.  Still not very good. 
It all _seems_ to work for a while.  But after a suspend-to-disk/resume
cycle (which may not be relevant) and five-odd minutes uptime the machine
shat itself.
See 
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/1.txt
 for the whole log and
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/config-sony.txt
 for the config.
It's presently sitting in an xterm echoing keyboard input and permitting
the mouse cursor to move, but it doesn't do anything else.
I have a bad feeling about the hrtimer+dynticks patches, frankly.  We had a
lot of discussion and review of the original patchset and it almost all
seemed OK apart from this tsc-goes-silly problem.  But then this lot:
highres-timer-core-fix-status-check.patch
highres-timer-core-fix-commandline-setup.patch
clockevents-smp-on-up-features.patch
highres-depend-on-clockevents.patch
i386-apic-cleanup.patch
pm-timer-allow-early-access.patch
i386-lapic-timer-calibration.patch
clockevents-add-broadcast-support.patch
clockevents-add-broadcast-support-fix.patch
acpi-include-apic-h.patch
acpi-include-apic-h-fix.patch
acpi-keep-track-of-timer-broadcast.patch
i386-apic-timer-use-clockevents-broadcast.patch
acpi-verify-lapic-timer.patch
acpi-verify-lapic-timer-exports.patch
acpi-verify-lapic-timer-fix.patch
got merged and I haven't looked at any of that and I don't know that anyone
else has and I don't even know if anyone knows what's in there.
But I do know that it fiddles with APICs, and they are quick to anger.  I
have little confidence in merging all of that material.
I'll retain it all for a while so that we can continue to try to fix this
APIC problem but if/when we get that done I think it's time to drop all of
it and start again, because APIC changes really do need a lot of careful
review and thought.

No, it's no good at all.  This time it just went back to its old ways of
taking a month to get through initscripts.
