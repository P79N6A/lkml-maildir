I know of other filesystems which allow this. but they do express
caution.. (Such as AmigaOS)
Something like this could be nasty if not implimeted right.. for example
rm -rf... and in some cases where inode tables became corrupted 
where things could get just a little interesting :)
But thats not to say it couldnt be done properly... and would be nice for
some applications.. 
Theres just that degree of hesitancy about it..
Maybe something to suggest for ext3 in the future.. (If we ever make it to
ext3)
Regards, Jim.
