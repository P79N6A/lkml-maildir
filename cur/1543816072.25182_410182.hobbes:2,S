I've attached a similar patch that has been tested using the DS1374 on the Freescale MPC8349MDS reference system. It is patterned after a similar change made to the m41t00 driver. The changes work, but I am also unfamiliar with workqueues, so my patch may not be any better.

This patch changes the DS1374 driver to use workqueues (taken from a
similar change to the m41t00.c driver.) This patch has been tested on the
Freescale MPC8349MDS.
