Well, it is already under "kernel hacking". 
I guess you missed it, right ? 
+VM statistics support
+CONFIG_VM_STATS
+  If you say Y here, the kernel will collect detailed information about 
+  the VM subsystem. This information will be available in /proc/stats. 
+  More documentation about this option can be found in 
+  Documentation/vm/statistics.
+  This is only useful for kernel hacking. If unsure, say N.

Obviously we want this disabled by default.
