I already think about renaming kevent aio, since it uses kaio name,
which you frequently reference too, but you definitely did not think
about kevent.
And out of curiosity, how masichistic I would look if I intentinally
want to receive negative reaction from you :)
As far as you can recall, in all syslet related threads I was always for
them, and definitely against micro-threads, but when we come to the land
of IO processing using event driven model - here I can not agree with
you.
So, ok, no micro-thread name.
