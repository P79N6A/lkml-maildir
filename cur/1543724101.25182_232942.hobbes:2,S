No.  I see no reason to disregard your understanding of biological 
control systems.  Millions of years of evolution have fine-tuned some 
very complex and robust control feedback systems.  While I wouldn't 
suggest that they're the only way to do the job, they're something that 
we should definately pay attention to.
Frankly, I think the cross-pollination that you bring from your 
background in medicine can do nothing but help us.
