Maybe... do you mean your CMOS settings are periodically reset ? In this 
case it usually is simply a worn-out battery.

K7S5A Pro are dirt cheap these days, so it might be a good idea to buy a 
new one.
For the record, reallocated sectors are quite common with modern disks, 
I had some (3-4) on a one-year old 120Go Maxtor but the drive worked 
perfectly. You should install the smartmontools and run smartd 
configured to send you an e-mail each time a new defect is found. You 
have then one more opportunity to anticipate a drive going to fail by 
backuping and restoring on another drive.
