Kernel 2.2.7 on standard PC, VGA text mode console, Virge/DX video card.
Yesterday I noticed that the shape of several letters were trashed on the
console.  On investigation I found that the characters affected were
  @ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
- that is, 40 through 4F hex.  Had to reboot to get things back to normal.
I presume that something had trashed the video card's character generator
memory.
Two possible culprits:
1) Crashme was running
2) I had done "kill -9" on the X server, which occasionally leads to a
second or two of screen fireworks
Where is the smart money going ?
