Did you get out of the wrong side of the bed or something? Geez, try and help 
then get flamed by a troll for your efforts...Plus the fact I was not even 
arguing! I was asking questions...
Further, I was postulating to see what the differences (or indeed 
similarities) are between the VM's to cope with desktop use vs server use. 
No-one seems to know right now.
How does one test the VM precisley? Sorry for the ignorance on this subject.
Kind regards,
Matt
PS If you're going to reply with a childish, unproffessional remark do us all 
a favor and be quiet. If I say something stupid and nobody replies I get the 
hint usually.
