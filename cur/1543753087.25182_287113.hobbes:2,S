I guess I'm not seeing what there is to propagate.  If the vfsmount we
are moving is mounted under a vfsmount that's in a p-node, then there'd
be something to propagate, but since the --move doesn't change the
structure of mounts underneath the moved mountpoint, I wouldn't expect
any changes to be propagated from it to other mountpoints.
I must be missing something fundamental....
