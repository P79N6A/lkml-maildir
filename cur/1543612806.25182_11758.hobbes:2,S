Could you try:
- if concurrent flood pings between cbgb an dpern improve the throughput 
with 2.4.16 and HTTP?
 # ping -f pern
or
# ping -f cbdb
- Could you check what happens with 2.4.16 if you revert to the tulip 
driver from 2.4.14?
Copy the entire linux/drivers/net/tulip/ directory from 2.4.16 into 2.4.14.
