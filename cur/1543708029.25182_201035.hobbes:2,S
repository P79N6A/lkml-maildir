Hi
I am working here at a Tablet PC with serial touscreen controller .
For whatever reason this controller now is configured to have COM1 at 
0x220 and not at 3F8 .
Is the aera of the "wellknown legacy " ports over and therefore it is 
becoming more rare that wellknown IO are dissapearing.
Would it be therefore worth investigating the possibility to not 
hardcode this in include/asm-i386/serial.h ?
Or am i just in a lucky situation that some littel taiwanese did make a 
joke of the week and programmed the serial at this IO ?
Since i got it working now with a patch include/asm-i386/serial.h and 
kinda fine with it.
Of course i would love to have the ability to maybe load the serial 
driver ( serial.o ) with a paramter telling where to search ?
Or could it be a easy thing to have a addittional module loaded which 
changes this config at runtime ... so i dont need a "special patched " 
kernel ?
Just curious Robert
