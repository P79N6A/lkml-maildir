Here is a little sample glib application that shows the ease-yet-power
of inotify.
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/inotify/glib/
It integrates inotify watches into the glib mainloop via GIOChannel.
Everything is abstracted behind simple interfaces, so this might prove a
nice start for curious inotify developers.
