Subject: [PATCH] fix CONFIG_MTD_SHARP_SL if CONFIG_MTD=m (try2)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Sharp Zaurus SL-C3200 with CONFIG_MTD=m and CONFIG_MTD_SHARP_SL=y (as it
is bool) lost support for the ROM flash. With CONFIG_MTD=y it has no
problems.
It is caused by losing of compiled code of
drivers/mtd/maps/sharpsl-flash.o.
It was linked to drivers/mtd/maps/built-in.o and drivers/mtd/built-in.o,
but lost and not linked to drivers/built-in.o (because CONFIG_MTD!=y).
Patch below fixes this problem by creating sharpsl-flash.ko (and the
code works correctly as a module).
This is second try (first sent Nov 10 to linux-mtd@lists.infradead.org).

 	  This enables access to the flash chip on the Sharp SL Series of PDAs.
Command to ensure, that CONFIG_MTD_SHARP_SL is the only problematic part
of MTD.
