OK, I was reading the test backwards.  Makes sense now.

Stephen's patch supports arbitrary sets of memory ranges, and works with
any ACPI-compliant motherboard (in theory).  It seems reasonable to my
eyes.
But there are two things from your patch that may be worth saving:
 a) The fixes in vremap need to be put into ioremap.  (Mostly a concept
    transfer.  No code can be saved.)
 b) The detection code for the Triton I82437 chipset may be worth
    transferring, assuming that it doesn't support ACPI.
