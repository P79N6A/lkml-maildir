Assume that most applications are broken then.
I assume that most will just call close() or fclose() and exit() right
away. Does fclose() imply fsync()? 
Some applications will not even check the [f]close() return value...

Or very specific, at least.

IF that application uses a marker to mark completion. If it does not,
data=ordered will be the safe bet, regardless of fsync() or not. The
machine can crash BEFORE the fsync() is called.
