mmu_notifier_register only runs when windows or linux or macosx
boots. Who could ever care of the msec spent in mm_lock compared to
the time it takes to linux to boot?
What you're proposing is to slowdown AIM and certain benchmarks 20% or
more for all users, just so you save at most 1msec to start a VM.

If you want the global lock I'll do it no problem, I just think it's
obviously inferior solution for 99% of users out there (including kvm
users that will also have to take that lock while kvm userland runs).
In my view the most we should do in this area is to reduce further the
max number of locks to take if max_map_count already isn't enough.
