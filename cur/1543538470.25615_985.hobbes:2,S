  Hey! That's the real problem! SIGDANGER is a good ideia, but if you're
going to install a sig handler for every application running, then I don't
know if it will work at all.
  OK, Netscape usually has tons of memory that could freed, but it is
_not_ an application that you can rely on to do that for you. Netscape
is extremely buggy! You will be in luck if it even reacts when it receives
SIGDANGER. Sometimes it even ignores SIGTERM.
  Actually Netscape is one probable reason why your system could be
OOM'ing, since it frequently gets out of control. If it installs a handler
for SIGDANGER, when your system runs out of VM it surely won't kill 
Netscape. From the last discussions I understood that the purpose of 
SIGDANGER was not to kill any process with a handler for it, for they were
important. As for other processes with no handler, some will get killed to
free memory.
