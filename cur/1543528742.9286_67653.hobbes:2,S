Hi Harold,
It looks like you may need a newer version of hdparm to identify the DMA
mode as UDMA2.
I've found the IDE subsystem under linux doesn't perform upto platter speeds
on high-end IDE disks. I have a Seagate Barracuda 20GB, which I get 28.2MB/s
(outer recording zone) under MS Windows 2000, yet 15.3MB/s under linux.
That's almost half!!
I was getting 20.2MB/s with my older Maxtor 5120+ 10GB drive, but I can't
understand why performance is less - although it was a older kernel(!). I
get a nice 128MB/s buffer cache read speed though.
Indeed, I posted a question on these lines, but go no replies. It's a pity,
since that extra speed would be 'free', and satisfy lots of linux (IDE)
speed-merchants.
Dan
