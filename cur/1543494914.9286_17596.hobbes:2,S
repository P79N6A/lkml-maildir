Yes, but that's dangerous, because it means that the oops is send
to a user mode process, the user mode process calls write(), fsync(),
etc.
It means that a crashing kernel continues to write to you harddisk.
You want to minimize this as much as possible.
And: if we deserialize the filesystem, this will often fail,
because the 'kill thread' might cause a lost semaphore, and thus 
a deadlock.
