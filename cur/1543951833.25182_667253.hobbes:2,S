Yes, I was hitting the text_poke() oops with 2.6.25-rc3-mm1 but not with
2.6.25-rc5-mm1.
This _might_ have been due to a snafu in git-x86: it had a [patch 2/2] from
Mathieu but was missing the needed [patch 1/2].  But I don't know if this
was the cause and I don't know whether 2.6.25-rc3-mm1's git-x86 had the
same problem.
