I am not trying to say anything bad about your work - I am trying to
caution Andrew that not everyone cares so much that they lose 200 megs of
pagecache. It doesn't affect everyone equally - I'm just trying to put the
voice of those of us who care more about responsiveness than throughput,
if I may borrow the argument from upthread.
I often fear that a lot of benchmarking is done one-sided, and does not
reflect the usage patterns of a typical Linux user.
Then there's the relative importance of subjective "feel", vs hard
numbers. Maybe some people prefer that their system feels nicer, even if
it doesn't compile kernels so fast. And I think this decision is best left
to at least one of those knobs (hey, all you know, people might even
adjust the knob in a crontab).
