Don't use rsync (or http) access unless you have to.
Try using "git://git.kernel.org/" instead. 
Now, it may be that if we have lots of people using it, the CPU usage of 
the server-side effort will go through the roof, and we'll have to come up 
with something else (most likely meaning having some mirrors also run 
git-daemon, so that the CPU overhead can be pushed out too).
The point being that you shouldn't see the packing as even an issue (it 
should be a per-repository decision). The fact that it shows up is because 
of using non-git-aware protocols.
