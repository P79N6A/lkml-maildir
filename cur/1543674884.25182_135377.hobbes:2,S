Now if we can convince someone to code it :(
I wish I could throw something together myself but I can only suggest the 
ideas.  Hopefully someone with the time/skills/interest can put something 
together to do this. I would have no problems testing the feature if someone 
else who could write it needs some help testing.

Great idea. Not really a button in make menuconfig, but a make allmodconfig 
and it resets everythign to modules. Then you could use the regualr make 
config facility to tune it. There would be no need to hack up make 
menuconfig.

Are you suggesting this as a feature? Lol, i tried make help and it there was 
no rule for it. 2.4.20 kernel.
