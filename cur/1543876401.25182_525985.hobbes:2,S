I think it's a bit too fine grained, and a new system call 
(io_bindfd()?) would be easier to use.  In addition, you would move the 
eventfd_fget() out of the submission path.
For the users that want fine grained control, they can already call 
io_setup() multiple times and submit iocbs to different completion rings.

Do not meddle in the internals of kernels, for they are subtle and quick to panic.
