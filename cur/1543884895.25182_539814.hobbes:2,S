No, this converts the allocation from a robust one which can sleep into a
flakey one which cannot.
If we want to just clean this code up, we should switch to
	GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_HIGH
and add a comment explaining why we're turning on __GFP_HIGH (pointlessly,
I suspect).
However I suspect what the code really meant to do was to use just
GFP_KERNEL.  It's been that way since
