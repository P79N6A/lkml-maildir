I think this is one of the largest problems of the current Linux
development model.
Many people seem to divide people into 'users' (who aren't particularly
useful) and 'developers', who actually do something. People (like me),
who can devote a _little_ time to narrowing down and reporting bugs fall
into the 'user-whiner' class. And get ignored.
What results is that you only get bug reports from active
developers. Which means that rare bugs don't get fixed.

It hasn't. The result is a system that works for you (and other active
developers), but not for everyone. As an example -- try running Linux on
a modern laptop, connecting some USB devices, using ACPI, or
bluetooth. Observe the resulting problems and crashes. You'll hit loads
of obscure bugs that have been reported, but never got looked at in
detail. I certainly have hit them and reported most, and most got
dropped in various places.
Does this mean these are unimportant bugs? No. This does indeed mean
(following your thinking) that these aren't important bugs for me. I
have worked around them in various ways, some involving actually buying
new hardware, or not using certain features at all. And the cycle will
go on -- others will hit the bugs, report them once, see them dropped,
move on.

Interesting you should think you're 'rewarding' people. I thought your
goal was to have fun working on cool software and making it
better. I also thought I had the same goal as a bug-reporter.
When I write software, I care about every bug report and consider people
doing the reporting a very valuable resource.
