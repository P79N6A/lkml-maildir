Greetings all;
I just got a new monitor (stinks up the place) that should respond to 
power saving off, but I've not found where to turn this on.  I just 
searched the kernel configs and kde settings without finding the magic 
twanger that enables that.
So where do I look next?

Cheers, Gene
People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
