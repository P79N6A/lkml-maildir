Ok the reason being is that the lock not only protects the 
smp_call_function_data pointer but also acts as a lock for that critical 
section. Without it you'll constantly be overwriting the pointer halfway 
through IPI acceptance (or even worse whilst a remote CPU is assigning the 
data members).
Although i'm not denying there isn't a way to do this lockless, i believe 
what some architectures did was poll on the pointer then do an assignment 
which i think is a bit too much effort when using a spinlock is much 
saner. Regardless i'd be interested to hear about alternatives.
Cheers,
