Although a US court recently held a "thou shalt not badmouth our product"
clause in a contract illegal, I don't see where the GPL prohibits a contract
that contains a clause "the recipient agrees not to engage in actions
A, B, or C" where C is "distribute the code".
The GPL prohibits such a restriction *IN THE DISTRIBUTION LICENSE*.  It
doesn't say squat about whether I agree to some restriction in some OTHER
agreement.
