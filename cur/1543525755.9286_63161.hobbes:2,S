 I think, it's right (I'll lookup my x42 docs and results of my
experiments I performed a few years ago, to be sure, though).  Note, it's
hard to achieve a buffer overrun for the 8048 unless there are problems
with the transmission to the host or one is a truly fast typist. ;-) 
Pressing too many keys simultanously and achieving the shadow keys effect
is, on the other hand, quite easy on most keyboards.  BTW, most BIOSes
emit a chracteristic short beep on receiving the overrun code.
