How about addining an additional item to the config scripts: a "build
id". This can be any random string. It just gets statically compiled
into the kernel, and is retrieved via `cat /proc/build-id` or whatever.
This will allow users to match up a running kernel with its config data,
without actually cramming the data into the kernel.
