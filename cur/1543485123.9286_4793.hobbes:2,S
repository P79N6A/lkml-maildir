In a way many cards behave like that, ie. you hand a packet to the
card and the card sends it out when it feels like it.

You don't, it is up to the upper layer protocols to deal with
retransmission if necessary.

If it fails to send them out you simply discard the packets. It is
perfectly 'legal' for packets to get lost on the way to their
destination, if you want to make sure data is transmitted correctly
you should use a reliable protocol such as TCP.
