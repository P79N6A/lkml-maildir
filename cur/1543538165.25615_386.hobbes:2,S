For example uni2char() of cp950 will translate 0xFFFF to two '?' and will
return 0, because of unused fields in u2c_FF[] are filled with 0x3F...
or are not they? And char2uni() will silently convert 0xF9,0x01 to 
{ 0x00, 0x3F }.
BTW, these tables do not follow uni1 = low, uni2 = high byte, as nicely
shown in cp950's char2uni():
  *uni1 = charset2uni[cl].uni2;
  *uni2 = charset2uni[cl].uni1;
  
Maybe you should pass these tables through some filter to byteswap
them? Or convert uni1/uni2 to simple unsigned short? As compiled
nls modules are not portable from one architecture to another, byteordering
should not matter...
