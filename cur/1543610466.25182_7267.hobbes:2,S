It'sa worthy follow-up to the 2.2.x "greased weasel" releases, but as
yesterday was Thanksgiving here in the US, and a lot of turkeys offered
their lives in celebration of the new 2.5.0 tree, the 2.4.x series got
christened a "greased turkey" instead of a weasel.
It may not have quite the same connotations of slippery speed as the
weasel, but then some people said the same thing about the penguin too.
