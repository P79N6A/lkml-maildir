  Folks,
     I'm not sure how to access the memory spaces on my PCI card.
     I do 
     From /var/log/messages:
		SSE: Start of card attachment.
		SSE: Found a DeCypher card, interrupting on line 3
		SSE: Bar0 From 0xfeaff000 to 0xfeafffff F=0x200 MEMORY space
		SSE: Bar1 From 0xfeafc000 to 0xfeafdfff F=0x200 MEMORY space
		SSE: Bar2 From 0xfe000000 to 0xfe7fffff F=0x200 MEMORY space
     My driver detects the card, and asks about the memory areas.
     Then I do request_mem_area(0xfeaff000,4095, "SSE");
     Then I do a readl(0xfeaff100); and get this:
        Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address feaff100
     Any hints? Maybe these are byte-addresses, and I need to do:
     readl(0xfeaff100>>2);
     I'm just beginning this adventure, so please excuse the basic 
     questions.
                           -Alan
