Subject: [PATCH 00/17] Uml little fixups for new and existing code [for 2.6.17]
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Lots of little patches for compilation fixups, error path bugs and the like.
New "features" are support for running sparse on userspace files, a Makefile
cleanup, and finally working around the COW format incompatibility between 32
and 64 bit UMLs; the last one has been tested for a while.

Inform me of my mistakes, so I can keep imitating Homer Simpson's "Doh!".
