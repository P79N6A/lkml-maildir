Val!
I'm sorry to see you have to drop this one...C'est la Vie.

Yeah, I am willing and able to maintain tulip as well.
Either way, parisc and some mips64 folks are stuck with tulip since
that's what is "embedded" on the motherboard. So it would make sense
for someone from either camp to maintain it.
Thanks to David Lang for the offer of 4-port Dlink Tulip card.
HP has two types of 4-port tulip cards (64-bit/33Mhz and 32-bit/33Mhz)
that I gave to Val...so whoever picks up the maintainership can
probably (eventually) get those from Val.
thanks,
grant
