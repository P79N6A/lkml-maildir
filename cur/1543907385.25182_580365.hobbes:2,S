2 reasons:
This change will eventually isolate multiple line
printk messages and allow easier insertion of 
printk_block_start
printks
printk_block_end
so that multiple line messages are kept together
in the message logs.
and I've done tree-wide patches for single line
printk(KERN_\(emerg|alert|notice|crit\),
(about 2000) and fixed several dozen lines without \n
or things like "KERN_<level> /n msg"
Here's the perl script I used.
It's imperfect of course.  There are comments with
embedded semicolons where it fails, and #defines
aren't substituted too well.
if ($#ARGV < 2) {
    print "usage: KERN_<level> pr_<level> files...\n";
    exit;
}
for ($i=2; $i <= $#ARGV; $i++) {
    PrintkSearchReplace($ARGV[$i], $ARGV[0], $ARGV[1]);
}
sub PrintkSearchReplace{
    my($file, $search, $replace) = @_;
    my $orig = "";
    local($/);
    open(my $fh, $file) or die "File not found '$file'\n";
    $orig = <$fh>;
    close(my $fh);
    my $parts = $orig;
    my $whole = "";
    @segments = split(/\;/, $parts);
    foreach $line (@segments) {
	if ($whole ne "") {
	    $whole = $whole . "\;";
	}
	my $origline = $line;
	if ($line =~ m/\bprintk\s*\(\s*${search}\s*.*\".*\\n\s*\"/ms) {
	    
	    $line =~ s/\bprintk\s*\(\s*${search}\s*([^\"]*)\"/${replace}\(\1\"/ms;
	    $line =~ s/\\n\s*\"\s*/\"/ms;
	    print "${file}: changed:\n" . $origline . "\;" . "\nto:\n" . $line . "\;" . "\n" ;
	}
	$whole = $whole . $line;
    }
    if ($orig ne $whole) {
	open(my $fh, ">${file}") or die "Could not open '$file'\n";
	print $fh $whole;
	close(my $fh);
    }
}
