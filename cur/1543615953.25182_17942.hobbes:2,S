The bug may be real but the fix would prevent garbage collection working
at all - which I grant would fix the problem. 
You don't need a socket to be dead to want to garbage collect it. If a
socket is getting disposed of while in use then there is a
maybe_unmark_and.. call missing, or a lock on the unix socket table missing
somewhere.
