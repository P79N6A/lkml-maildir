Hello linux-experts,
    I went through the kernel source code file
/fs/pipe.c and I found that the pipe file system
configured as a module. But in lsmod I am unable to
see it. This is my first doubt.
    My second doubt is, in pipe.c we have lot of
symbols like 
  PIPE_WAITING_READERS(*inode)
  PIPE_WAIT(*inode)
  PIPE_MAX_RCHUNK(*inode)
   What are they? funtions or macros? What they do or
where are their implementation in the kernel source
tree?
Thanks,
selva
