Authentication...
At the Connectathon in February, we got as far as setting up a working
test machine for the RPCSEC_GSS kerberos V5 authentication on the NFS
and RPC clients. AFAIK, Andy is currently working on adding support
for SPKM auth. and data encryption.
I'm not sure exactly which ciphers we need for all this (Andy can
perhaps comment?) but we'd definitely want to see part of the crypto
patches go into the standard kernel at some point soon.
Cheers,
  Trond
