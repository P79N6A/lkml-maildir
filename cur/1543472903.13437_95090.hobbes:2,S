Merry Christmas to you too, Frank.
But I thought select(2) already works on regular files in a predictable
manner, i.e. the descriptor sets are "always ready", so it is kind of
uninteresting. More interesting is the Asynchronous I/O issue. I remember
asking about aio_ support in the kernel and somebody pointing me to some
userspace implementation. But I can't understand how can reliable
asynchronous I/O (to both regular files and block devices) be implemented in
userspace (in HP/UX one has /dev/async for that, in Adabas one has
/dev/adabas/async etc etc). So I am still wondering whether asynchronous
I/O implementation in the kernel is a thing on TODO list or not.
