Hi,
I was trying to recompile my 2.4.18-3smp RedHat kernel and received the 
following error after running 'make menuconfig' and selecting 'Networking 
options:
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's
configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error
report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: MCmenu17: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mec@shout.net>.  You may also
send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and
which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
[root@localhost linux-2.4]#
Thanks
Mike
