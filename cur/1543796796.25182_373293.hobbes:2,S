This patch checks to make sure that the number of instructions doesn't surpass
BPF_MAXINSNS in sk_chk_filter().

This is a diff from 2.6.15-rc5. And I am not subscribed, so please CC me on any
replies.
The previous check in sk_chk_filter() doesn't seem very logical to me because it
should either be limited to BPF_MAXINSNS or only limited by the max value of an
`int' (not really limited). sk_attach_filter() and get_filter() in
drivers/net/ppp_generic.c limit it to BPF_MAXINSNS, but get_filter() in
drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_ppp.c and anything else that will use it only get this
seemingly "random" limit.
This way it is checked for in only one place, and has a single constant limit.
Thanks!
