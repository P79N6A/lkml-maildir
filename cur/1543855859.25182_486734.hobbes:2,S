Dear Igmar Palsenberg,
If you are working on arcmsr 1.20.00.13 for official kernel version.
This is the last version.
Could you check your RAID controller event and tell someting to me?
You can check "MBIOS"=>"Physical Drive Information"=>"View Drive 
Information"=>"Select The Drive"=>"Timeout Count"......
It could tell you which disk had bad behavior cause your RAID volume 
offline.
About the message dump from arcmsr, it said that your RAID volume had 
something wrong and kicked out from the system.
How about your RAID config?
Areca had new firmware released (1.42).
If you are working on "sg" device with scsi passthrough ioctl method to feed 
data into Areca's RAID volume.
You need to limit your data under 512 blocks (256K) each transfer.
The new firmware will enlarge it into 4096 blocks (2M) each transfer.
The firmware version 1.42 is on releasing procedure but not yet put it on 
Areca ftp site.
If you need it, please tell me again.
Best Regards
Erich Chen
