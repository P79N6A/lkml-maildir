Hi Linus,
Could you please pull from:
git://git.o-hand.com/linux-rpurdie-backlight for-linus
which:
 * Adds myself as backlight maintainer (I've been involved with it 
   since its creation, just never officially)
 * Resolves the locking nightmare backlight usage was turning into
 * Fixes several bugs
 * Adds a new backlight driver
 * Cleans up code in a number of areas and removes duplication
 * Fixes some Kconfig issues
Its been in the last two -mm releases apart from the last Kconfig fix.
The late merge is due to waiting for ACPI to merge drivers containing
backlight code first. The combined ACPI/misc changes are 
Acked-by: Len Brown <len.brown@intel.com> although its hard to apply
that to a specific commit.
Thanks,
Richard
