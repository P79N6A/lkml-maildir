nope, doesn't seem to be.  i just recompiled the kernel (2.2.12 now) with
unix98 pty support enabled, on the off chance that you were right (even
though xterm seemed to be trying to access /dev/ttyXX), with the same
results:

any further suggestions?
i'm going to try recompiling glibc2 next, just in case... though glibc-2.1
should be ok, shouldn't it?  (that's what i have right now - compiling
2.1.1 with gcc-2.95 as i type)
