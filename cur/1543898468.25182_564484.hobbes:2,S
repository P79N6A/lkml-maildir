What was the criteria for inventing the XAAA#### format?
It doesn't comply with the PNP standard format above, since
it starts with four letters instead of three.
I don't think that "XVID0001" will be more meaningful than "video"
when seen in sysfs...

If the criteria is to stay within an 8 character id length,
I'd rather spell a word with capital letters, and stick
in 0's where we don't need more letters:
POWER000
SYSTEM00
THERMAL0
PWRBTN00
SLEEPBTN
VIDEO000
DRIVEBAY
Or when we discussed this before, we though about not conflicting
with a standard (or vendor standard) name by becoming the Linux vendor --
say using  the "LNX" prefix, and trying to spell something useful
in the remaining 5 characters. eg.
LNXPOWER
LNXSYSTM
LNXTHERM
LNXSLPBN
LNXPWRBN
LNXVIDEO
LNXIOBAY
