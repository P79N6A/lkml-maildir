This is Linux-RAID specific and not material for the linux-kernel
list.
Please, just post your questions to linux-raid, not linux-kernel.
And most importantly, when you ask me these exact same questions in direct
e-mail anyway, it is a little wasteful to also trouble this list with your
question as well.
Thank you,
 (and you got the answer in the reply to the direct mail two minutes ago)
