Hai,
	I am using kernel version 2.4.2. and samba version is 2.2.0. and
having two clients which are mounted using smbfs to same shared directory.
When i read a file xyz (file is in smbfs mounted directory) from one client
and i am didn't closed, from second client i written some data using write
system call and closed xyz file,  i am not seen the updated data from client
one. Then i closed file in client one and tried to read the data, but I am
not able to read the updated data. As I observed that when second client is
written the data and closes the Modified time is changed for the file xyz in
the server and when I closed the fist client the modified time is over
written by fist client. When I reading the file once again from in fist
client, client is checking the modified time in the server, in the veiw of
fist client modified time is not changed, fist client is reading data in
page cache insted of getting the data from the server. The above situation
is occuring due to the following things
	1. The file attributes are changing only at the time of closing the
file not while writing.
 To avoid this problem my suggestion is
	1. While every write the modified time to be notified to sever by
sending SMBsetattr.
	2. While reading client has to get the modified time and copy the
client access time and the recent modified time ( I mean modified time sent
by the server) request the server to set the attributes by sending
SMBsetattr.
Thanks

Kernel version? This sounds a lot like a problem fixed sometime around
2.2.18 where smbfs didn't consider certain files as changed.
Are both clients smbfs?
