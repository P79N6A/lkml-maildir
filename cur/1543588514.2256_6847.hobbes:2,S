Ok, that is what my generic code does.

My generic code doesn't drop the lock.

Basically yes, however for the wakeup I wrote a dedicated routine that
knows how to do the wake-all-next-readers or wake-next-writer (it is not
the same helper function of sched.c).

This is what I implemented originally but then I moved the fast path inline
for the fast-path benchmark reasons. I think in real life it doesn't matter
much if the fast path is inline or not.

yes I agree, infact I added the ->magic check only to catch uninitialized
semaphores (and this one doesn't hurt readability that much).

In my last patch the fast path is inline as said above but it is not in asm yet
because I couldn't get convinced it was right code. I plan to return looking
into the rwsem soon. I also seen David fixed the bug and dropped the buggy
rwsem-spin.h, so I suggest to merge his code for now, after a very short look
it seems certainly better than pre5.
