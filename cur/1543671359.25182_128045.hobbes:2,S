Yeah just a quick question.  Not that I am actually able to code kernel
level drivers (I wish), but when I do code that would be part of one, I would
prefer not to make it a hassle for others to impliment.
To the point, I tend to do C++ classes, then make a C interface.  Makes
it easier for me to program.  Now, you may not want to mess with the C++
and convert it over, plus you may not want C++ code in the kernel.  I am
about to start on the compression code for the fast algorithm that may be
used for kernel swap compression and compressed swap-on-ram, assuming
these swap modules are implimented.  I don't want to cause any... oddities.
The C interfaces are just C functions that take a numerical handle which
identifies a class in a self-sorting linked list, as well as all the other data that
goes to each member function of the classes.  I can still do it in C alone but
it's a little more work.  Just don't wanna mess anyone/anything up.
