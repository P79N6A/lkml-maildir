So I think the pid_ref could is likely still short several helper functions,
but is probably usable.  Using it is slightly more costly but I doubt the
pid hash table has any significant performance penalties.
The important property to preserve from a maintenance standpoint is
that the helper functions take enough information that when I go back
and implement pid spaces I will need to at most tweak the pid_ref
implementation, and the pid_ref helper functions and not need to
go back through and change all of the users (again).

Ouch!  I believe free_pidmap now needs the tasklist_lock so
we can free the pid and kill the pid_ref atomically.  Otherwise
the pid could potentially get reused before we free the pid reference.
I think that means ensuring all of the callers take tasklist_lock.

I need a helper that does this from a task structure but that
is simple enough.

I think calling this put_pid_ref instead of free_pid_ref
is more accurate.  The whole alloc/free _pid_ref instead
of the more traditional get/put kind of throws me.  Since
an allocation/free is possible I can see where this comes from 
but I don't feel right about those names.
