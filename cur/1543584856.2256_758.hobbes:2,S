Debian sid (unstable).  ac18 compiled fine.  ac20, i got this:

Also, sometime between ac7 and ac18 (spring break kept me from testing
stuff inbetween), i assume during the new aic7xxx driver merge, the
order of detection got changed, and now the ide-scsi virtual host is
host0, and my 29160N is host1.  Is this on purpose?  It messed up a
bunch of my stuff as far as /dev and such are concerned.  
Thanks,
Nathan
