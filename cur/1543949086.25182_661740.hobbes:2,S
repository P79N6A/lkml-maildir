Oh boy. The fact that you can have an epoll fd cross the fork boundary, 
does not mean that any indiscriminate use of it leads to sane results:
	efd = epoll_create();
	fork();
					pipe(fds);
					epoll_ctl(efd, ADD, fds[0]);
	epoll_wait(); ????
	...
	pipe(fds);
	epoll_ctl(efd, ADD, fds[0]);
					epoll_wait(); ????
It is *NOT* a matter of semantics.

There sure is :)

I guess that over the time, Al became software WRT junk going there :)
