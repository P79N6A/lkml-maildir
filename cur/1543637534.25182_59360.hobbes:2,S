You don't lose the hex data.  The patch just prints data that the kernel
already has.  For some situations this patch does match the needs of
developers better.
} I would much rather have hex data. It makes all the parsing tools
} connected to the serial port that much easier. If instead of hacking the
} kernel you bang out a little bit of expect you can do it all on the host
} driving the embedded box, and find the file names, and open them in an
} editor at the right function, and do a parallel lookup in bugzilla for
} matching oops logs...
