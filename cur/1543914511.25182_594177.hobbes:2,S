I believe that's correct.  It's basically the equivalent of BSS, but 
used for an emulated OS (the app in question is an emulator).

Interesting idea.  Worth a try.
However, this doesn't address the kernel side of things.  Am I correct 
in thinking that the kernel is making an invalid assumption that it can 
find the load_addr based on the first segment?

Our emulated OS wants to put stuff at fixed addresses in this range, so 
we're trying to keep the loader from allocating stuff there before our 
program gets a chance to start up.
