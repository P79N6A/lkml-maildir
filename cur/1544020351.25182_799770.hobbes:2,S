We should just get rid of cryptd_tfm_in_queue since it's only used
for debugging.

That's fine by me.  I'm not so worried whether the load-balancing
version exists as a template alongside cryptd or on top of cryptd.
However, the default cryptd should definitely not perform balancing.
Also note that not doing balancing does not mean that we only use
one CPU.  cryptd should simply use the CPU on which the request was
received.  So if the requests are received in parallel then the work
would be carried out in parallel.
The load-balancing version would also need to ensure that the
completion handlers are invoked in the exact order in which the
requests were received since this is crucial for IPsec.
Cheers,
