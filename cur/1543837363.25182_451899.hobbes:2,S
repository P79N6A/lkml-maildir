No, skb->input_dev is used when redirecting packets around in the
stack and may change. Even if it would keep its value the reference
to the netdevice is not valid anymore when you free the skb as the
skb was queued and the refcnt acquired in __netifx_rx_schedule()
has been released again thus making it possible for the netdevice
to disappear.
