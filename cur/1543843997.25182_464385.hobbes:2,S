I thought about that too, but it will end up with ata1-6 with dummy 3 
and 4 while the BIOS shows continuous 4 ports.  I wanted avoid this 
discrepancy as it could cause confusion to users.
The other option is adding pp->port_idx to record hw port index.  It 
does make the code a bit simpler.  What do you think about this?
Thanks.
