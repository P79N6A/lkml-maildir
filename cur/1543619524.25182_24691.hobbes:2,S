Are you sure you want that?  If so, that would work today, it's about a
20 line script.  You clone the tree, collapse all the stuff into a new
changeset, and pull.  It will all automerge.  But now you have the detailed
stuff and the non-detailed stuff in the same tree, which I doubt is what
you want.  I thought the point was to remove information, not double it.
