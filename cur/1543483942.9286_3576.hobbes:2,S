mm. I'm trying to do a front-end, and I can see one problem. The current
config scripts are meant to be interpreted rather than compiled. As of now,
all the constructs _can_ be compiled eg to create a web form. However, since the
linus tree is not guaranteed to maintain this behaviour, this might become
false in the future. I _don't_ want to use javascript etc to do the config
because if you can run netscape with java on ur machine, u can probably compile
a kernel anyway. Need a front end that can be accessed with lynx. Alternative
is to use telnet with shell=make config.
