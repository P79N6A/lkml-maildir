Hi Alan,
Went to compile sendmail today on 2.2.10-ac9, which tried to reference
SOCK_*, and barfed finding none.  The SOCK_* were moved to asm/socket.h
from their original linux/socket.h, but now have the added "feature" of
having "#ifdef __KERNEL__" wrapped around them.  As a hack, I put:
#ifndef __KERNEL__
#define SOCK_STREAM     1               /* stream (connection) socket   */
#define SOCK_DGRAM      2               /* datagram (conn.less) socket  */
#define SOCK_RAW        3               /* raw socket                   */
#define SOCK_RDM        4               /* reliably-delivered message   */
#define SOCK_SEQPACKET  5               /* sequential packet socket     */
#define SOCK_PACKET     10              /* linux specific way of        */
#endif
... near the end of linux/socket.h, which has now made compiling
network apps happier.  Maybe this only affects libc5 people? :-)
