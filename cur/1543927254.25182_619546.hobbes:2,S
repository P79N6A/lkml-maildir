I presume you mean "significantly higher."
Realistically speaking, a random UUID is probably the best you're going 
to ever get.  I highly suspect that any time- and MAC-address-based 
solution is going to suffer from mis-set clocks and misprogrammed MAC 
addresses more often than you will have collisions in a 122-bit random 
number.
