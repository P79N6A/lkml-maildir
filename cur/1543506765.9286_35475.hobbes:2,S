   Some time ago it was reported here the SIOCGIFCONF is not working and
   I thing Davem said he'll fix it.  Well, I have 2.3.14 and it still
   does not work.  A few functions, and soon more, in glibc depend on
   this.
Please try 2.3.15-pre3 as it has a networking merge in it, if the bug
persists I'll quickly fix it.
Later,
