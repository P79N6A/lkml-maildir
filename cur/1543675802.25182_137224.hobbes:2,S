Plain ext3 with UTF-8 filenames, no ACLs or Extended Attributes.  It was
created with last week's RH rawhide then I moved to 2.5.70, uptime 5
days now.
Should I be worrying about filesystem corruption now?

Unfortunately no.  I just noticed that message in dmesg after 5 days of
uptime.  Hmm, I just noticed this line within that last post:
 <6>note: updatedb[18515] exited with preempt_count 1
If it happened during updatedb, then it must have been around 22 hours
ago during cron.daily's updatedb.  My laptop was completely idle during
that time.
