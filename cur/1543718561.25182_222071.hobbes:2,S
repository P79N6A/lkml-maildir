OK, with CONFIG_OOM_KILLER=y (2.4.26) I get this:

Better than without OOM killer, although
still not perfect - for some reasons it also
decided to kill mozilla *after* killing the
test program. Strange.

At least I received a couple of messages that
stated that my test program doesn't OOM the
RedHat Fedora 2.4 kernels - mprotect() fails
with ENOMEM. That resembles the correct
behaveour of the fixed 2.6 so I think at least
RedHat got rid of that problem somehow.
Hope that helps.
