Uh, I don't know where you got that idea... I'd be happy if all we
had was non-POSIX thread libraries.  But POSIX is there and there are
good reasons to support it corectly.
The point is that the non-POSIX people seem pretty happy with how
it works now (with every thread with its own PID and own signalling,
etc).  This psuedo-single-pid crock is only (as far as I can see)
useful for POSIX.

You're confusing two completely seperate issues here:
  * N vs N+1 - whether the thread group is symetric (N+1, i.e. slave
    threads with one dedicated master thread) or assymetric (N threads
    with a random one also acting as the master)  This is of no real
    concern to the programmer, so we should choose whatever is the
    clean implementation.
  * N:N, N:M, N:1, etc - this is the ratio of userland threads to kernelland
    threads.  This has important performance ramifications, and the ideal
    solution is the topic of much debate.
Again, these are 100% seperate issues.  Just because my proposal forces
a N+1 model doesn't mean that the library can't be N:M or anything else.

So you're saying that all non-POSIX threads will be forced to use CLONE_PID
and play these signalling games even if that's not what they want, just
for the benefit of ps?  That's silly.  CLONE_PID should be the realm of
pthreads, other threading models already get what they want.
I think we just need to realize that "group of threads for pthread-esque
signal handling" and "group of threads for procps pretty printing" need
to be seperate things.  For the latter we should just use the simple
mm-id solution.

That logic has to go somewhere, no matter what model you use.  In my
model you can just keep the pointers to the signal queue on the kernel
stack of the master thread.  Shouldn't be too gross.

Is this some POSIX requirement?
In some other email you alluded that this a security measure for
"setuid MT apps".  Well, if it's setuid then the user won't be able
to signal it anyway.  Or are you thinking of apps that have different
per-thread credentials (so maybe the user could signal the child
threads but not the master)?  Well in that case I don't think POSIX
gives you any garauntees and it's not clear what the correct response
is anyway.  We certainly don't provide any special protection now.
