I bow down before you.
I thought I had done some rather horrible things with gcc built-ins and 
macros, but I hereby hand over my crown to you.
As my daughter would say: that patch fell out of the ugly tree, and hit 
every branch on the way down. Very impressive.
All hail Rusty, undisputed ruler of Ugly-land.
Side note: can you verify that __builtin_choose_expr() exists in gcc-3? I 
don't think we've relied on it before except on arm, and that one has 
always had its own compiler version dependencies..
