well, i hope u'll take a look at our file system, but keep in mind:
a) the code is in an early beta state.
b) srfs _cheats_ a bit, by enslaving a local file system.
c) the code is not as neat as i'd like it to be.
d) we havnt checked interoperability, since we dont have other platform.
   although, srfs should work on any platform running java.
cheers.
