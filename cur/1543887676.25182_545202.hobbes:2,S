You don't know how much you're going to change, but it could be anything
in the range of 0 to PAGE_CACHE_SIZE. Clearly a (0, PAGE_CACHE_SIZE)
range is the right range to pass in.

Oh god you're doing ClearPageUptodate directly on pagecache pages?
In general (modulo bugs and crazy filesystems), you're not allowed to have
!uptodate pages mapped into user addresses because that implies the user
would be allowed to see garbage.
If you follow that rule, then you can never have a !uptodate page be passed
into page_mkwrite (unless it has just been truncated, in which case you
catch that case anyway).

No, just assumes that nopage brings the page uptodate and people use the
correct invalidation functions to invalidate pagecache, so you never have
!uptodate pages that are mapped.

The one you put there was wrong.

Your filesystem internally moves pages between mappings like tmpfs?

Well I don't really care, so I'll just concentrate on trying to get the
code fixed.
