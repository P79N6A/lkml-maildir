No, look again.
			old hash		new hash
	2.6.6:		10280			10496
	2.6.6-bk:	10685			10862
in both cases, the new hash makes each iteration about ~200us (or whatever 
the metric is) slower.
There's something _else_ going on too, since plain 2.6.6 is so clearly 
better than the others. I don't know why - the only thing -bk does is the 
hash change and some changes to GFP_NOFS behaviour (different return value 
from shrink_dentries or whatever). Which shouldn't even trigger, I'd have 
assumed this is all cached.
NOTE! Just "simple" things like variations in I$ layout of the kernel code 
can make a pretty big difference if you're unlucky. And the new dentry 
code doesn't align the things on a D$ cache line boundary, so there could 
easily be "consistent" differences from that - just from the order of 
dentries allocated etc.
But it's interesting to note that the hash does make a difference. The old 
hash was very much optimized for simplicity (those hash-calculation 
routines are some of the hottest in the kernel). But I don't see that a 
few extra instructions should make that big of a difference.
