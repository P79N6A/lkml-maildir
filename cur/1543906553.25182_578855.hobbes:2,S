Then make autosuspend support for the printer driver a config option.
This is not a reason to change the core usb code. The core code needs
to be involved only for device that are driven through usbfs. The major types
are:
- scanners
- PTP devices
- OBEX
Scanners are covered by SANE's latest CVS
PTP are a class and could be covered by a single udev rule
Obex is comm, so the patch wouldn't help.

Kernel developers are a diverser lot than you think ;-)
We don't enable autosuspend in drivers we can't test, except where
the lack of a kernel driver forces us to use a broad swipe. Printers
were tested, too, and most printers seem to work.
