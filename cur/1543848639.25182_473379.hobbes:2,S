A few years back I developed a network sniffer
on 2.4.20 using PACKET_MMAP supporting very high packet rates.
When testing with high packet rates, invariably if traffic
was present while the buffers were being setup, the buffer data
would be corrupted. I worked around it by ensuring no packets went
into the stack before the userspace process sniffing the packets was started.
