For the purposes of this discussion I was not considering direct use of
rdtsc from userland for timing, I've accepted the arguments that this is
a lost cause with today's hardware (although I maintain it was viable in
practice on previous generations of hardware).  Besides, rdtsc is
useless from userspace if the kernel traps it, because the whole point
of using it over gettimeofday() was that it was dirt cheap.
I'm content to make sure the kernel's internal timekeeping is solid.
