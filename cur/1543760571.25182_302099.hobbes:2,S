Any chance that it will apply to other Radeon based machines? I have an 
ASUS (1681) using the 8700 chipset. At the moment suspecd doesn't work 
at all, but at least somewhere in 2.6.10+ turning off the backlight 
started working with the screen saver.
I guess it's better than my Dell and Toshiba laptops, which suspecnd but 
don't resume :-(
