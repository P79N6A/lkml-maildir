Hi
  I am trying with the 2.5.70 beta kernel. The compiling and installing 
is OK. But
when calling "depmod -ae -b ... -F .. -r ..", the modules dependency 
and  the function
references were not resolved correctly. For example:
   in module fs/vfat/vfat.o, many functions used were exported by 
fs/fat/fat.o. But it
still complaint that the functions reference unresolved.  There is not 
similar problem with
2.4.* kernel.
  If you have met the same problem, could you let me know?
  Thanks
