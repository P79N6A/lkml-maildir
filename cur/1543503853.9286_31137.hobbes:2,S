-ac patches are kind of pre-patches as are official pre-patches from
Linus. You must allow time for maintainers to prepare things as good as
possible for normal patches. 
If you follow the kernel list, you couldn't miss other breakage at boot
under ALpha with 53c8xx controllers that wasn't explainable by driver
changes. This has been investigated and, even if I am not the guy that
makes changes for Alpha, I am sure that appropriate fixes will be
available soon.

If I would supply diffs for ALpha, given that I donnot have anything to
test changes for Alpha and that my knowledge on Alpha are about null, I
just would mess up everything instead of really helping a single bit.

If you want stuff that does not exist yet, you must hack by yourself. If I
had a system as yours that does not want to boot with 2.2.11-pre2, I would
have reversed the changes in core_pyxis.c, checked that they have no
relationships with other stuff, and then would have given a try with my
hacked tree. No guarantee, neither further helping from me here. 
About the latest sym-1.5d patch available at tux site, it probably applies
to 2.3.X kernel, but does not apply to latest 2.2.X due to changes that
went directly to kernel tree and that just broke my patch series.
