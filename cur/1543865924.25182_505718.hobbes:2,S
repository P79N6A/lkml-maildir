Hello,
I am going to buy a intel DG965RYCK motherboard. The board looks ok to me , 
but I found that it contains marvell's 88SE6101 PATA controller , and I need to use PATA.
I also noticed that 2.6.20 adds experimentally support for that chip.
But driver says that it enables it via 'legacy mode'
I will be glad to hear whenever full support is planned or not.
And as last thing I want to ask you whenever current support is usable, 
that is can I use DMA , can I use DVD as at least reader for CD/DVD , 
and even better can I burn disks with it ( although I can live without it)
Your truly,
             Maxim Levitsky
