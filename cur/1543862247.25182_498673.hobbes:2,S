Sorry, I wasn't sufficiently clear. Mmap()+msync() can't be used for
that if data to be written come from some external source, like video
capturing hardware, which DMA'ing data directly into the user space
buffers. Using mmap'ed area for those DMA buffers doesn't look as a good
idea, because, e.g., it will involve unneeded disk reads on the first
page faults.
So, some O_DIRECT-like interface should exist in the system. Also, as
Michael Tokarev noted, operations over mmap'ed areas don't provide good
ways for error handling, which effectively makes them unusable for
something serious.

splice() needs 2 file descriptors, but looking at it I've found
vmsplice() syscall, which, seems, can do the needed actions, although
I'm not sure it can work with files and zero-copy. Thanks for pointing
on those interfaces.
