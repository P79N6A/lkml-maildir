	Right.  They are orthogonal issues.
	However do remember that our current blockdevice level limitation
	is 2G (or 4G ?) worth of 512 byte blocks, that is, 1 TB (maybe 2)
	for any given block device size.
	Your filesystem can't grow over that if you are limited to single
	blockdevice per filesystem.
	All that RAID supplies for a filesystem is single block device,
	however large/redundant/etc. that might be.
	I am inclined to think that what we need out of the future file-
	systems is much more in multi-device spanning style, than any
	RAID/LVM/MD creation.
