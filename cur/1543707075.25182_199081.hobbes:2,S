Additional good news is that following octets in a utf-8 character sequence
always have the highest order bit set, precluding / or \x0 from appearing,
confusing the kernel.
The remaining zit is that all these represent '..':
2E 2E
C0 AE C0 AE
E0 80 AE E0 80 AE 
F0 80 80 AE F0 80 80 AE 
F8 80 80 80 AE F8 80 80 80 AE 
FC 80 80 80 80 AE FC 80 80 80 80 AE
This in itself is not a problem, the kernel will only recognize 2E 2E as the
real .., but it does show that 'document.doc' might be encoded in a myriad
ways.
So some guidance about using only the simplest possible encoding might be
sensible, if we don't want the kernel to know about utf-8.

Indeed.
