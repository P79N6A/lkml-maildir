Urgh. You too?

Well I tried it when slub went first in and it did not go well. The issue 
is that x86 detects the cache line size on bootup. Thus cache_line_size(). 
Most of the other arch have compile time cache line sizes. Thus 
L1_CACHE_BYTES. So L1_CACHE_BYTES is the maximum value that 
cache_line_size() can take.
What I was attempting to do is to make x86 have one compile time cache 
line size L1_CACHE_BYTES. That raised objections because space was wasted.
