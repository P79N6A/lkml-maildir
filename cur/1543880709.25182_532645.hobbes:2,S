Yes, I think that is a practical position, if not an ideal one.
MTD (to pick one example) does need to be decruftified: remove
r->blkcore_priv->exiting, probably ->blkcore_priv->thread_dead, switch
deregister_mtd_blktrans() to use kthread_stop().  But it's a bit much to
expect Eric to make that conversion, and to suitably test it.  All he can
do is to make a best-effort and hope that someone else tests it, which
isn't very reliable.
This partial patch at least gets us some of the way there, and serves as a
gentle reminder to dwmwyouknowwho to finish cleaning this stuff up.
I'd be more concerned about a part-conversion in a subsystem which has no
identifiable maintainer, because in that case the chances are that we'll
just forget about it an the conversion would never be completed.
And of course, these are not simply cleanup patches: we actually need to get
the kernel threads out of the daemonize() and signalling game to complete
the virtualisation work.
