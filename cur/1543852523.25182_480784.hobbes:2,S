Yes, that's maybe part of the problem. Nevertheless I think we should reject 
every patch that adds new functions of global use (everything that might get 
called from outside this module) without proper kerneldoc comments on it. At 
least everything that comes with EXPORT_SYMBOl_*.
I just remember that digging out all this cdev_* stuff from inside the code 
was just pain. If your new feature is _that_ cool that it has to be 
immediately merged than there will be surely someone out there to help you 
with the documentation if your English is a bit poor. Someone has to review 
that code anyway. If you can give him hints even in bad English what is going 
on it will surely help him (or her) to understand what you're doing, review 
your code and write up some nice comments to make life for the next one to 
touch it a _lot_ easier.
