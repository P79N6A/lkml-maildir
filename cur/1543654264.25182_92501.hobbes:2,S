I only see the duplicate entries when I have the "Probe All LUNs on
each  SCI device (SCSI_MULTI_LUN) turned on.
To make things more complicated, my flash drive doesn't seem to be
working (I have never got this cheap little flash drive to work on
Linux and it just barely works on Windows), but cdrom is doing the
same thing.
Here is what I see when I plug in usb flash reader:
scsi logging level set to 0x00000100
drivers/usb/core/hub.c: new USB device 00:1f.4-2.2, assigned address 3
Product: USB to CF + SM Combo (LC1)
Manufacturer: DataFab Systems Inc.

scsi0 : SCSI emulation for USB Mass Storage devices
scsi scan: INQUIRY to host 0 channel 0 id 0 lun 0

scsi scan: INQUIRY to host 0 channel 0 id 3 lun 0
scsi scan: 1st INQUIRY failed with code 0x40000
scsi scan: INQUIRY to host 0 channel 0 id 4 lun 0
scsi scan: 1st INQUIRY failed with code 0x40000
scsi scan: INQUIRY to host 0 channel 0 id 5 lun 0
scsi scan: 1st INQUIRY failed with code 0x40000
scsi scan: INQUIRY to host 0 channel 0 id 6 lun 0
scsi scan: 1st INQUIRY failed with code 0x40000
scsi scan: INQUIRY to host 0 channel 0 id 7 lun 0
scsi scan: 1st INQUIRY failed with code 0x40000
If I turn off the multi lun option the I see the same
output minus the:
scsi scan: Sequential scan of host 0 channel 0 id 0
... and the extra:
  Vendor: Datafab   Model: USB to CF + SM C  Rev: 0017
  Type:   Direct-Access                      ANSI SCSI revision: 02
scsi scan: host 0 channel 0 id 0 lun 1 name/id: ''
scsi scan: INQUIRY to host 0 channel 0 id 0 lun 2
This is one of those Compaq/SmartMedia combo drives so
maybe that is screwing things up, except the cdrom does
the same thing.
Oh well, the cdrom appears to be working, so the duplicate /proc/scsi/scsi might just be cosmetic.
