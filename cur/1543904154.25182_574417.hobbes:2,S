Well, they don't run on Fedora 6 either (which has the same code, it's
part of exec-shield):
$ strace ./cat
execve("./cat", ["./cat"], [/* 55 vars */]) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
...
$ file cat
cat: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
Funny nobody noticed that before...
