Hi
Pentium M / Dothan steppings are: A1, A2, B0, B1, C0, C1. My /proc/cpuinfo shows stepping 6. Does this mean i have stepping C1?
If so, then can i compile cpufreq tables into kernel? I have centrino laptop without those tables in ACPI.

The only issue is that there are four different versions of Dothan CPUs for
A1, A2, B0, B1, C0 steppings. There is only one version for C1 stepping.
So, if i have C1 Dothan then i can compile voltage tables into kernel?
If yes, then can someone send me patch for kernel version 2.6.13 ?
