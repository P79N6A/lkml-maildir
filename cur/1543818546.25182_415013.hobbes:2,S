The up_mutex is needed to ensure that a watch that does not exist when
calling inotify_find_update_watch() still does not exist when calling
inotify_add_watch().  It seemed to me that the find/update and add
functions needed to be separated for the kernel api.
Unfortunately we can't use dev->ev_mutex here as it's taken during the
callback.

Done.
 * Callers must use the established inotify interfaces to access inotify_watch
 * contents.  The content of this structure is private to the inotify

I'll follow up with some stress test results.
