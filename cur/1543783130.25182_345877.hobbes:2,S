True, that´s a great advantage.

Please have a look at the following patch. It takes your idea of 
inlining but moves
the special cases into the macro, speeding things up for the very likely 
case of
s_pitch == 1 and the less likely case of s_pitch of 2. Treating s_pitch 
== 2 special
gives a still significant performance improvement of more than 10 % for 
16x30
fonts.
This way also bit_putcs looks better again ...
Andrew, as this way is better than and still as fast as my first 
approach I think
framebuffer-bit_putcs-optimization-for-8x.patch should be reverted and the
following patch should be applied instead.
Antonino, Roman, Geert, do you agree?
cu,
