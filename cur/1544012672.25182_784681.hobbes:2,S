Hi,

That would be a rather pronounced NAK then? (sorry ;)
(reason: rendering my web surfing box useless due to networking loss,
see thread "[RFC/PATCH] e100 driver didn't support any MII-less PHYs...")
AFAICS e100 is still "non-MII"-challenged (2.6.28 doesn't appear to have
the necessary changes, and this pull doesn't seem to contain updates either),
and a long chain of attempts to get this resolved hasn't worked yet.
Somehow I seem to hit some nice walls getting my stuff into kernel.
- e100 MII
- i810 AGP resume fix
- acx100 (ok, that one is a bit mean to add to this list ;)
- ...
ALSA patches handled by Takashi OTOH were almost always a
"bammm, in it is, there you are, HAND".
I can't seem to wash away my slightly CK'ish feeling ;)
Thanks,
Andreas Mohr
