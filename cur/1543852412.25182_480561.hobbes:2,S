Hi Alan,
Thanks for spending time working on this. Sorry that I never followed up 
after my previous attempt, I've been really busy having starting a 
proper job.

I just noticed that my earlier patch is included as of 2.6.19-rc, so 
actually your patch applies there and results can be compared. (if 
you're in strong objection to it's mainline inclusion, I could ask for 
it to be reverted, but it at does solve a lot of problems for users over 
the previous state with no reported problems...)
I now have access to a VIA system. It's not really an indicative test, 
as with my patch, no devices get quirked (due to some being outside the 
legacy IRQ range and others failing the new_irq != irq test). However I 
could at least confirm that your patch didn't cause any devices to be 
quirked again.
Thanks,
Daniel
