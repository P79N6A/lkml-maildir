I have managed to narrow down the problem. strace did not help at all.
The problem was the Load "freetype" line in xorg.conf.
With it commented out, python wsjt.py runs fine.
That would explain why strace did not help at all.
So, this is not a kernel problem now, it is an Xorg problem.
Section "Module"
#       Load  "glx"
        Load  "record"
        Load  "extmod"
        Load  "dbe"
        Load  "dri"
        Load  "xtrap"
#       Load  "freetype"   ### freetype crashes X in wsjt.py
        Load  "type1"
        Load  "speedo"
EndSection
I will have to ask the Xorg people how to run gdb on the freetype module.
