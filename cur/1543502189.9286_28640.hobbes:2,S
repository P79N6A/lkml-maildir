Time to embarrass myself once more on l-k ;) Intuition tells me that deadlocks
and races need to be thought about, but unfortunately I can't see what they
are.
How is writing to a filesystem on the loopbacked device simultaneously with
the hosting filesystem any different from writing to two files on the hosted
filesystem simultaneously?
Swapping, of course, is a different issue. Do we have any flags at the moment
which prevent people from trying to swap to inappropriate block devices (nbd,
certain raid levels with md, etc.)?
