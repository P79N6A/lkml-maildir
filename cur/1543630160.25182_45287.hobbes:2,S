Why not just put that knowledge in the ARM/MIPS architecture makefile?
ARM already has multiple linker scripts, and it already selects on them
based on CONFIG options, so I'd much rather just do that straightforward
kind of thing than play any clever games.
MIPS runs some sed script on it and that could be expanded to do this, and
all the same arguments apply.
