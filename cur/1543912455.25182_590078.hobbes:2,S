Great, why do not we remove all the things marked obsolete and
start Linux 2.*newversionbeep*. Just rm, no add, and then tag.
If we never start moving to get rid of the old stuff, we will be
ending up where Microsoft is; though we won't get there as fast since
Linux was designed carefully in the first place and did/does not
collect as much compat dust.
