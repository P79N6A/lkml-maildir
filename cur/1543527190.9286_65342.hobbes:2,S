I will try a BIOS update.  This board is advertised as supporting UDMA/66
(and it's certainly using a new enough chipset that it ought to -
VIA82C686A) but it's quite possible things aren't being set correctly.

I know.  For some reason I get a "Speed issues UDMA 3/4 not implemented"
error with the latest DVD/CD+IDE patch, so I dropped back to UDMA 2 for the
sake of testing.
(Also, if the person who sent me personal e-mail yesterday asking about
UDMA timings is reading this, I accidentally lost your message.  If you
could resend it, I'd appreciate it.)
