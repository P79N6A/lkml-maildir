Well it doesn't use a new major, does it?
+#define DEVICE_MAJOR 204
+#define DEVICE_MINOR 40
Which is:
204 char	Low-density serial ports
		  0 = /dev/ttyLU0		LinkUp Systems L72xx UART - port 0
		    ...
		 32 = /dev/ttyDB0		DataBooster serial port 0
		    ...
		 39 = /dev/ttyDB7		DataBooster serial port 7
205 char	Low-density serial ports (alternate device)
which seems reasonable, I suppose, but a patch to devices.txt is needed
please.
