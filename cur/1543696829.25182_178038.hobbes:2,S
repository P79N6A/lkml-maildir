I have a problem with VIA-RHINE driver using two D-LINK DFE-530TX cards. Problem occurs when I'v got compiled in kernel driver with enabled option "use MMIO". Kernel recognizes both cards assigns eth0, eth1 but when I try to set IP on eth1 it errors with message "device or resource busy". 
Problem occurs on 2.4.22 with no modules
With 2.4.19 from SuSe and modules both cards work fine...
anybody can help me ?
