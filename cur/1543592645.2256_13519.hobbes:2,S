Hello!
I tried to load thie aha152x modules:
modprobe aha152x io=0x140 irq=9 (which is correct)
entries in /proc/scsi are generated,
but the modprobe hangs and is unkillable.
aha152x reports scsi discs to the kernel messages,
although there are none connected to it.
I tried to use a scanner, but it it impossible
to work with the controller.
Did I miss any patches/ fixes ?
