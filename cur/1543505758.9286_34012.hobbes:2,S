This is is cc'd to linux-tulip; I assume Don will read it there.
I have an Alpha Miata on which 0.91g does not work.  The module
loads, but no traffic gets across the interface.  I can provide
whatever debugging information you'd like if you'll instruct me what
to do.
0.89H works fine on this machine, at least until I start X, at which
point it stops working.  If I exit X, then "ifdown eth0; rmmod tulip;
ifup eth0", it starts working again.
