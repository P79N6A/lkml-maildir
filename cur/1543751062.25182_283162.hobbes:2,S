If the user was bad, the user directory *will* just vanish ("what was your
login, please"), and any other directory may vanish, too:
$ mkdir /tmp/test;cd /tmp/test
$ ls -la
total 0
drwx------    2 7eggert  users          40 2005-01-05 03:00 .
drwx------    3 7eggert  users          60 2005-01-05 03:00 ..
$ # /tmp/test gets removed here
$ ls -la
total 0
$ echo foo>bar
-bash: bar: No such file or directory
