Having #ifdef CONFIG_NET all over is definitely suboptimal.
Unfortunately it looks kind of hard to untangle your skb use from the
rest of the driver, so putting a dependency on NET might be the best bet.

How are you building on powerpc?  I don't see any way to turn on
CONFIG_PCI_MSI except on i386/x86_64 and ia64.
Anyway building an ia64 cross toolchain is easy with 
http://kegel.com/crosstool
I would just get rid of your atomic_clear_mask() and atomic_set_mask()
calls.  They're bogus because you're not even operating on an
atomic_t, and not many architectures implement them.  Just take a lock
if you need to modify the bitmap atomically.  A spinlock is cheaper
than two atomic operations (although I guess for a slow path, it hurts
in .text size).

It's probably because I use CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__ too.
There are a few other things I don't think we've really closed on:
 - The whole duplicated SMA / ipath_verbs doesn't work without ib_mad loaded.
 - Andrew raised some questions about the special "pick a device for
   me" that I'm not sure we satisfied him on.  I don't find the
   /dev/ptmx argument that convincing, since I don't think /dev/ptmx
   is considered the best example of interface design.
 - It looks like ipath_copy.c is completely unused now that you're not
   including the ipath_ether driver.
 - R.
