Sorry. Even the version in -mm does not restore all 256 bytes, so it
will not change anything. The quirk sits at offset 0xf2 in config space.
So either we really restore the full config space (probably a good idea
by itself) or we add the quirk handling to the suspend-to-ram codepath.
On a related note, what happens if we try to restore the config space of
a device which has vanished? Right now this happens on all mainboards
with asus_hides_smbus==1 during resume-from-ram.
Greg, do you have any comments on the patch starting this thread?
Regards,
Carl-Daniel
