Hello,
(I hope this is not the wrong mailing list to ask this question..)
Does somebody know what the status of the support of nfs
via tcp (instead of udp) of Linux is ? Is there a version
supporting this (client and server) ? Are there some
plans to support this under Linux ?
best regards & many thanks,
Andre
