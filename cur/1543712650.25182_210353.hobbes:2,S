It is at the moment, I'm afraid. I'm hoping to get SCSI support for
suspend2 finished shortly. I did suspend a OSDL machine to SCSI in
January, but the driver lacked the power management that I needed to
reload the second half of the image and thereby be sure all was okay.

That should be doable, provided that the initrd doesn't mount anything.
Decryption is 'interesting'. The key needs to be set up in the resumed
kernel too. (Shouldn't be a problem, if you manage to suspend to it!).
