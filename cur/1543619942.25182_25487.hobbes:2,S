Yes, select()ing on it would be more useful, but I don't know if this
would clash with existing semantics, because currently select() on a set
of readfds that are cdrom drives always returns right away (I am not sure
why this would be, as if you open /dev/cdrom with O_NONBLOCK|O_RDONLY
you are supposed to be doing ioctls and no actual reading, no?).
Maybe such events can be in the exception fds?
