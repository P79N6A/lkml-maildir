one interesting thing that came out of the fedora readahead work is that
most of the bootup isn't actually IO bound. My test machine for example
can load all the data into ram in about 10 seconds, so that the rest of
the boot is basically IO-less. But that still takes 2 minutes....
So I'm not entirely sure how much you can win by just attacking this.
Another interesting approach would be to actually put all the data you
want to use in a non-fragmented, sequential area on disk somehow (there
is an OLS paper submitted about that by Ben) so that at least the disk
side is seekless...
