Here is a snippet from lsmod:
keybdev                 1728   0  (unused)
If I remove that module, the keyboard ceases to function. I have to ssh 
in and re-insert it. I have no idea why it says unused.
The module is loaded explicitly in rc.sysinit (Redhat 7.1)
2.4.9, the kernel where these keys work, uses the same driver.
