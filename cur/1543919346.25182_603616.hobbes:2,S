Well, I've talked to various people, and none of the main kernel people 
end up being at all interested in a kernel that has external dependencies 
on binary blobs for tuners.
So right now it seems like while I would personally want to have more 
vendors supprt their own drivers, if that in this case means that we'd 
have to have user-space and unmaintainable binaries to tune the cards, 
everybody seems to hate that idea. 
As such, the old and decrepit em28xx driver seems more useful to people, 
since at least it supports the limited set of hardware on its own.
