I've been noticing this too with 2.2.x with a Tulip card (Netgear). The
eth0 interface occassionally appears to be completely unresponsive, but if
I run ifdown and ifup on it, it's back to normal. No log messages or any
other symptons, except occassionally ifconfig will show a very large
number of collisions. This machine is new enough that it's never run a
kernel before 2.2. 
The freeze-ups tend to occur when I'm in the middle of something important
so I haven't had a chance to run tcpdump on it yet.
(I'm not completely sure I have the latest ifconfig (net-tools 1.46?), so
this might not actually be collisions I'm seeing.)
