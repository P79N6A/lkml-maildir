Actually, GCC has always required that inlines be specified first
for them to be inlined, even in earlier versions.  For example, from the
gcc 3.3 manual:
Some calls cannot be integrated for various reasons (in particular,
calls that precede the function's definition cannot be integrated, and
neither can recursive calls within the definition).  If there is a
nonintegrated call, then the function is compiled to assembler code as
usual.

I find it enhances readability to place functions in reverse order.
That way I know I can just go to the top of a file, and the first match
on the function's name is its definition.
