I think I aready gave the kernel version and introduced my application
in the first post. What are the further details you want? The reason I
keep asking for the 'lost mem' is that I want to focus on the problem,
not the workarrounds that may lead to further problems if I keep
increasing the concurrent scale.
Anyway, since the problem is already solved (see my last post), I'd
like to thank you for the help.
Xiaoming.
