You could use the arpd user mode solution. In recent kernels ARP is
implemented as a neighboring cache.
You can use dev_add_pack() in a module to receive arp requests (like
__initfunc does in arp.c)

static struct packet_type arp_packet_type =
{
        __constant_htons(ETH_P_ARP),
        NULL,           /* All devices */
        arp_rcv,
        NULL,
        NULL
};
__initfunc(void arp_init (void))
{
        neigh_table_init(&arp_tbl);
        dev_add_pack(&arp_packet_type);
...
