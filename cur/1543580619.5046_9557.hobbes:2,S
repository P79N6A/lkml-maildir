No, the inactive_clean pages are reclaimed before the
other inactive pages, and we want to give all pages
an equal chance to be used when we put them on the
inactive list.
This is especially true for freshly read in swap cache
pages, because we _expect_ that some of them will be
used.

Read mm/swap.c::deactivate_page_nolock(), my decision to
put all clean inactive pages directly on inactive_clean
lead to the fact that dirty pages would stick around
forever and page reclaim could be quite unfair towards
clean pages. This was changed later to put all inactive
pages on the inactive_dirty list first and have them
more fairly reclaimed in page_launder.

Rik
