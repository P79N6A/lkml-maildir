Devil's advocate:
Why should we need to support multiple different block layer APIs
to do the same thing? Surely any hardware that doesn't support barrier
operations can emulate them with cache flushes when they receive a
barrier I/O from the filesystem....
Also, given that disabling the write cache still allows CTQ/NCQ to
operate effectively and that in most cases WCD+CTQ is as fast as
WCE+barriers, the simplest thing to do is turn off volatile write
caches and not require any extra software kludges for safe
operation.
Cheers,
Dave.
