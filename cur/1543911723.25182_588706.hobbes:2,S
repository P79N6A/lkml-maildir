Great.

Yeah, it's a mess, I totally know that feeling. :)

The directory name is the kernel's kobject name used by userspace, we
can't change the name. Most of these names are used to name the device
nodes.
Also the link would just point to the direct child directory with the
same name, which would be kind of strange. We could add them back, if
really needed, but they didn't exist for long, so we think it's fine to
get rid of them when !DEPRECATED is used.
With the hierarchy of class devices in recently changed subsytems, it
would be totally inconsistent to make a difference between a class
device parent/child (no "device" link, no <class>:<devname> link) and a
bus device parent/child (links). For userspace, there is no interesting
difference between class or bus device parents.
These links are really only needed with the !DEPRECATED mode, with the
directories all spread around in different places, and you need to use
these magic links to reconstruct the virtual device tree from it. They
are the counterpart of the "device" link which is also not too useful in
!DEPRECATED mode, because it's always just the next parent device.
With !DEPRECATED we get a big unified device tree with all devices in
_one_ hierarchy. All Child/parent relationships can be read by just
walking the up and down the tree. All the classification directories
(bus/, class/, block/) will only be lists of symlinks pointing to a
specific entry point in the unified tree. From there you can walk upward
or downwards the path, without any magic rules.
Thanks,
Kay
