As someone who spends time debugging reiser3 issues, I've grown
accustomed to the named assertions. They make discussing a particular
assertion much more natural in conversation than file:line. It also
makes difficult to reproduce assertions more trackable over time. The
assertion number never changes, but the line number can with even the
most trivial of patches.
That said, one of my gripes with the named assertions in reiser3 (and
reiser4 now) is that the development staff changes over time. There are
many named assertions in reiser3 that refer to developers no longer
employed by Hans. The quoted one is a perfect example.
Hans, would it be acceptable to you to keep only numbered assertions and
 keep a code responsbility list internal to namesys? It would serve a
dual purpose of keeping the idea of named assertions, but also remove a
huge number of strings that bloat the implementation.
