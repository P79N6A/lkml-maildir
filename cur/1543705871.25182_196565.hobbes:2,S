Prakash, I have the same motherboard but not the latest bios (I think I 
cannot overclock in the same way when I flashed the latest, so I 
reverted one version). Perhaps I must upgrade and try.
About the "option" you're talking about in the bios, are you talking 
about CPU throttle?

Craig, I'm not talking about cpu disconnect because of the stability. I 
have 100% stability here with the two patches mentioned before in this 
thread. I was talking about my cpu showing temperatures between 53 and 
64º, what I think is very high.
