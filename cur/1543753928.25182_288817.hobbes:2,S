Ok. The throttle duration can be exceed.
What is a good value? 5ms, 10ms?

Really? The task prios are (lower value is higher priority):
0
..			For SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR (rt_priority 99..1)
98	MAX_RT_PRIO-2
99	MAX_RT_PRIO-1 	ISO_PRIO (rt_priority 0)	
100	MAX_RT_PRIO
..			For SCHED_NORMAL
139	MAX_PRIO-1
ISO_PRIO is between the SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR and the SCHED_NORMAL range.
