OK, half way through writing it down, I've realised what is happening
- in set 2, the keyboard seems to be emulating another keyboard
layout, (but apparently not a US or UK one).
For example, ; and : are on different keys.  Shift ; gives + and shift
: gives *
The keycodes generated, though, show up as follows:
; - 39
shift ; (+) - 13
: - 42, 39, release 39, release 42
shift : (*) - 9
So, if I press : on it's own, the keyboard actually simulates pressing
shift and ;
Likewise, if I press right-shift and @ to get ` the keyboard actually
sends a release 54 as soon as I press @, even though I'm still holding
down right-shift, then sends 41, release 41, then 54
I suspect set 3 will producde a more direct mapping of a single
keycode for each key, but we shall see...
I'll send along the complete list when I've finished it, (it's taking
ages :-) ).
John.
