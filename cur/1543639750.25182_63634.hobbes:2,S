Don't forget to count the total amount of
swap & block io.  (i.e. vmstat 1 > logfile & sum it up)
Good strategies for page replacement may result in
less io for the same job, which means a lot for
performance whenever you get disk-bound.  Many
a web server serves more than fits in cache, and of
course there are file servers too...
