I know this is one of those things that has more and more cool possibilities
the more you think about it but...
Is the device PHYSICALLY hooked up to the computer? If not, it shouldn't be
in devicefs.
The device tree (for which devicefs is the fs representation) was originally
meant to enable good device power management and configuration. driverfs
wasn't meant to handle iscsi or tcpip (that is, network) connections, nor
should it have to.
