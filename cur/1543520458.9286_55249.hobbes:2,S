	Hello,
	Your previous patch (those locks in scsi_lib.c) fixes the problem
when reading partitions from uninserted disks (SCSI ZIP). It seems that
it has been included in the 2.3.35-pre4 so no more on this.
	But there is (at least) other problem with the new 2.3.35pre
series, the inclusion of the new i2c code has broken bttv. First bttv.o
depends on i2c-algo-bit.o but when you include bttv.o i2c-algo-bit.o
is not included automatically, you need to check it manually; and even
when you include it bttv still doesn't fully work. When loading with
the following options in /etc/modules.conf:
pre-install bttv        modprobe -k tuner
options tuner           type=5
options bttv            radio=1 card=13         # AVerMedia TVPhone 98
post-remove bttv        rmmod tuner
the kernel reports:
Linux video capture interface: v1.00
i2c-core.o: i2c core module
i2c-algo-bit.o: i2c bit algorithm module
i2c-core.o: driver i2c TV tuner driver registered.
bttv0: Brooktree Bt878 (rev 2) bus: 0, devfn: 128, irq: 11, memory: 0xfd9fe000.
bttv: 1 Bt8xx card(s) found.
tuner: chip found @ 0x61
bttv0: i2c attach [Philips PAL]
i2c-core.o: client [Philips PAL] registered to adapter [bt848 #0](pos. 0).
i2c-core.o: adapter bt848 #0 registered as adapter 0.
bttv0: model: BT878(AVerMedia TVCapture 98)
bttv0: i2c read 0x80: error
bttv0: i2c read 0x82: error
bttv0: i2c read 0x84: error
bttv0: i2c read 0xb6: error
and although the bttv module seems to load correctly I'm unable to get 
color, the image is always B&W, sound doesn't work neither (I'm using an 
AverMedia TVPhone98)
	I was using the new i2c module (from the CVS at penn.netroedge.com) 
and the included mkpatch perl script patch the kernel cleanly and everything 
was working, so it seems to me that there was
some kind of 'typo' in the merging.
	Thanks
