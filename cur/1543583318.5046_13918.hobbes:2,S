Thanks, but it didn't bother me, or hurt any of my feelings at all.  I
just wanted to point out that all of the other usb drivers (with 2
exceptions) reside in the drivers/usb directory, and I didn't know if
you knew that.
(the exceptions are the input drivers, which are part of the input core,
and the cpia video driver, which has the parallel port and the usb
driver all together in one file.)

This argument has been discussed in the past (see the linux-usb-devel
and linux-kernel mailing list archives) but from what I remember, Linus
and others wanted them all to stay in the drivers/usb directory for now.
Personally I don't care either way, but it has been easier to do usb
core changes (such as the hotplug interface changes that I suggested for
your driver) with all of the drivers in one place, not that I can't do a
recursive grep :)
thanks,
