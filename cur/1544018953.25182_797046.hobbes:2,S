This is a bona fide deadlock in the _same_ callpath though - lockdep will 
catch it and it is straightforward to avoid.
The problem we had with work_on_cpu() was different: the "drive-by 
shooting" aspect of the keventd workqueue: it creates 'casual' (and hence 
hard to get right) dependencies between various, seemingly detached 
worklets.
Were were lucky that the tester was both willing to go through a dozen 
bisection steps to pin down the bug and also was kind enough to try 
countless rfc patches to figure it all out.
The only other maintainable way would be to remove work_on_cpu() - but 
it's a useful facility IMO.

Yes, but it's much different: the situation you describe is that if we 
think of work_on_cpu() as a 'remote function call' it can deadlock if a 
called function takes the same lock.
That's not news at all and developers should be careful not to take the 
same lock twice. work_on_cpu() does not change or extend that aspect of 
lock programming at all.
But the previous, fragile version of work_on_cpu() had a much more subtle 
dependency not related to the function that was called but related to 
work_on_cpu() _itself_ running in a context (the keventd workqueue 
threads) that have casual dependencies.
That's much harder to debug, much less intuitive, and also, IMO, a bug in 
the facility.

work_on_cpu() clearly cannot be in the kevent workqueue. I can only see 
two other solutions:
 1) turn it into a singlethreaded workqueue. (Probably fine as all users 
    are not performance sensitive.)
 2) remove it altogether and convert all users to atomic call_on_cpu() 
    calls. Probably doable albeit a bit restrictive IMO.
