It would be a lot more consistent if ->writepage always unlocks the page
(or starts the chain of events that eventually unlocks the page) even
when it fails.

Even then it's ok.  Without major surgery, those pages are going to loop
forever somewhere, it might as well be the inactive_dirty list.  This is
going to mess up the mm balancing calculations, but of course only when
somebody is actually using ramfs.  Maybe somebody will come up with a
tidy way of getting those pages entirely off the mm lists so they doing
just keep eating cpu cycles.
By the way, the whole concept of ramfs is really elegant - ramdisks are
just wrong, because all the ramdisk data in cache is in memory twice. 
Solution: throw away the disk, keep the cache.  Nice.
