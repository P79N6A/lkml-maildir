"contextualized" - I guess that means converted to cpuset
relative numbering - yes.
"per-allocation" - Most of the calculation of nodemasks and
zonelists is done when memory policies change.

Not AND'd - Folded, as in bitmap_remap().

Not an issue with Folding.

Not an issue with Folding.

Not issues with Folding.
With folding, an application that layed out an elaborate memory
policy configuration covering say 16 nodes can run in a 4 node
cpuset, where whatever would have been on node N gets folded down
to node N % 4.
With AND'ing, such an application would find 3/4's of its fancy
memory policy configuration replaced with MPOL_DEFAULT and -EINVAL
fallbacks.
