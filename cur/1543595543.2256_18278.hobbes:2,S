if i have a sticky bit on a directory where every user has permission to
write, and i write a file, that i will be the only one able to
modify/delete my file.
If there is no sticky bit on the directory, then every one is able to
manipulate my file.
How is this related to swap?
usually the sticky bit is used for /tmp /var/tmp, where it has to be used
for security reasons.
Maybe you are making confusion because some other Unix use the /tmp
partition with a special FS to use it also as a swap area (Slowlaris for
expample, the old, old, old HP-UX pre 7.X versions and so on), and
of course /tmp has the sticky be setted.
If i am wrong with my supposition, excuse me.
