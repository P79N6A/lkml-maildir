Hi all,
Andrey's suggestion can solve the compiling problem.
I also tested the problem that Vadim had just said. I found that the marco
version of printk indeed will have the problem in this kind of situation:
    printk("foo %d\n", bar());
bar() in marco version of printk won't be called. Because someone may put
meaningful instructions in it, it may cause error.
Is there any better solution of definition of printk that can greatly reduce
size?
BTW, I see many function definitions in kernel using "do {} while(0);". Do
they have this kind of potential problem, too?
Regards,
Colin
