This code will go away soon for both the devfs and non-devfs case..

It doesn't have to be a call.  Unless I completely misread the code
your dvb core references struct dvb_adapter in certain cases.  But
struct dvb_adapter is allocated in the actual drivers so these could be
unloaded and give you scrambled memory even when it's still in use.
So you need to acquire a reference on those backends whenever you
touch any object that logically belongs to them.
