Matt also has the same concern. I am pasting my response from my reply
to his comment:
I will make this an instance parameter if the idea to reduce as many
global variables as possible. But if the objection is because each adapter
may have different value for variable, then it is indeed a global value.
"is_dma64" - which is computed using the size of dma_addr_t - is telling
something about the kernel rather than the controller feature.
Thanks,
