That's true. I wrote that comment shortly after reading
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/4/448
 , but you are right, 7bit ASCII can
be too limiting at times... Hmmm...

I know there are places where floats and doubles can be used safely,
but for those rare occasions wouldn't it make sense to have the script
warn and require the submitter to justify the use?  After all, the
general rule is to not use floating point in the kernel, so such a
patch is suspicious.

Yeah wouldn't it be cool :-)  It might require a bit too much perl
magic to actually implement something sane, but I just threw every
idea that came into my mind into the mail, assuming Andy could sort
out the ones that were a little too crazy ;)
