This is a fairly regular occurrence in ata land: patches from maintainers
don't get merged, so I merge them for testing, then some fairly pointless
cleanup-style patch goes on a great tree-wide rampage thus destabilising or
simply destroying the more important, mysteriously-not-merged patch.
Nobody knows why this happens.
Peer and Kuan: can you please redo that patch against the current ata
development tree?
Thanks.
