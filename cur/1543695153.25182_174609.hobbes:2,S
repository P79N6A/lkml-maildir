This is happening right now and is 100% reproducible on two 
computers.
First computer is a dual Athlon MP 2000+, running the Gentoo 
2.4.20-gentoo-r7 kernel. The second one is a Toshiba 470CDT 
laptop running the 2.4.22 vanilla kernel.
The laptop currently doesn't have a working network card so I'm 
using a PQI TravelFlash card reader to exchange data.
The problem is that every time I remove the card reader and 
insert it again it gets a new device. The old ones remain in 
/proc/partitions and get set to 1GB size if I try to access 
them. Otherwise they remain showing the 64MB of the removed card 
reader.
For example, on the Athlon, /proc/partitions looks like this 
after inserting and removing the card several times:

I have also noticed that in /proc/scsi/ there is a usb-storage-N 
directory created every time I insert the card reader, with the 
file inside having a content like:
   Host scsi2: usb-storage
       Vendor: Generic
      Product: USB Storage Device
Serial Number: 0AEC305000001A006
     Protocol: Transparent SCSI
    Transport: Bulk
         GUID: 0aec5010aec305000001a006
     Attached: No
Only the last one has 'Attached' set to 'Yes':
   Host scsi4: usb-storage
       Vendor: Generic
      Product: USB Storage Device
Serial Number: 0AEC305000001A008
     Protocol: Transparent SCSI
    Transport: Bulk
         GUID: 0aec5010aec305000001a008
     Attached: Yes
I'm guessing the kernel is keeping it there for some reason, but 
I can't figure out why. I guess it might be trying to allow to 
reinsert a device later, but if so, it's definitely not working.
Here are the USB lines from .config for the laptop.
CONFIG_USB=y
CONFIG_USB_DEBUG=y
CONFIG_USB_DEVICEFS=y
CONFIG_USB_OHCI=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DATAFAB=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_FREECOM=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_ISD200=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_DPCM=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_SDDR09=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_SDDR55=y
CONFIG_USB_STORAGE_JUMPSHOT=y
CONFIG_USB_PWC=y
CONFIG_USB_USBNET=y
Perhaps I'm missing something obvious here, but I googled for 
this and didn't find anything. Other people seem to have had 
this problem, but I haven't found any answers.
Thanks in advance
