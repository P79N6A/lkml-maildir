I'm not sure why you think this is IO bound. For 
the throughput phase of the test (from which the 
metric above is taken) there is very little physical 
IO except at the start when the updates occur.  They
finish in a few minutes, after which there is very
little.

Perhaps you were looking at the start or at some other
part of the test?
The power test (single stream phase) does not display 
any performance hit at all compared to the baseline.
The throughput test runs eight streams (processes)
and does display the problem.  Furthermore the problem
is worse on 8 ways than on 4 ways.  It seems reasonable 
to me that this could be due to a task schedule issue.
Am I missing something?
