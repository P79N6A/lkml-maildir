Before somebody will notice this: my fix is not the right one (probably
due lack to sleep ;). Incidentally it worked _fine_ because the race is so
fast that the slab cache had not the time to reuse the mm_struct (the one
where I hold the mm_lock even if it's just deallocated) for another task. 
I am fixing it right this time. The fix is to make atomic the tsk->mm =
&init_mm and the mmput.
A real fix is coming soon...
