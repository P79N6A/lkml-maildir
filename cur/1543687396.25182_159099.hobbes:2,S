I last looked at irda, when my laptop was a 486/745, and thought that
the hardware still looked more or less like a 8250 variant.
I had previously used /dev/ttyS1 (where that was an IR port) to dump
debugging data.
Looking at the documentation for more recent hardware, I find this isn't really
the case any more for all hardware.
