Do you even know what you are talking about?  It is clear you don't.
1) You do NOT need to buy BK to use it on any open-source project,
   as long as you are willing to have the changelogs posted on the
   BK website.  Since most open-source projects host their entire
   CVS repository on a public website, this isn't any additional
   restriction.
2) Nobody is forcing anyone to use BK to contribute to the kernel.  The
   kernel is still available as a tarball and incremental patches.  Linus
   is still accepting patches in email just like he always did (or didn't,
   as the case may be).
Cheers, Andreas
