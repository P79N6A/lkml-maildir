As soon as it is secure it goes in, the VIA DRI developers are working on
it at the moment, and it should be suitable for merging soon...
we also have out of kernel DRM drivers for mach64 and savage that would
pose security issues if shipped, so we can't develop them in-kernel....
(another reason for the CVS tree)...
