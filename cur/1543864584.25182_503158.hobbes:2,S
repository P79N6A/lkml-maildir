The VIA quirks depend upon so many interacting things - the BIOS irq
routing data being correct, the ACPI tables being coded by someone who
had more than ten minutes to ship the product etc.
If you are feeling really really bored Nick you can work each IRQ routing
back using the chip data sheet. It's utterly tedious but may give an
answer.
