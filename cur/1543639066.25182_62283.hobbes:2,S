Hello,
I have a (possibly stupid) question. Is it OK, that dentries created by
binding unix-domain sockets remain in filesystem?
What I do is create a unix socket in /tmp and wait for clients to
connect in. The program removes the socket dentry when it shuts down,
but it sometimes crashes and the socket remains there.
Is there some reason the socket should remain unless explicitely
removed?
