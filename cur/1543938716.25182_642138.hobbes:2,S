--verbose please.  I don't understand that "own page table" trick.  Is
that page table actually used by the processor or is it just used to
maintain some sort of page list?

I *think* it would.  I'm not that deep in the VM details to be sure
though.  One possible problem I see is that the hypercall does also tear
down the mapping, so this isn't just a notify but also changes the page
tables, which could confuse the VM later on when it comes to the actual
pte clearing.
cheers,
