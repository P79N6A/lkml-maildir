Where are you getting 100MB/s?
The PCI bus can move around 130MB/sec, but RAM is lots faster.
A single PC100 DIMM can move 800MB/sec.
This P100 laptop I'm typing on gets better than 100MB/s ram reads.
Anyway, in clarification, Rik mentioned that two reads from different
disk (arrays?) on the same controller at the same time get more or less
the same speed.
