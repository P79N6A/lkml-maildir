NO! Every single waiter of the _file descriptor_ is waked, not of the futex.
One can associate N fds with a single futex address. FUTEX_WAKE with
nproc = 1 will only wake one of the file descriptors. Its up to the user
to decide if he wants a broadcast or not.
Have you seen the email where I told you exactly this?

epoll itself is a problem?! sorry, but i didn't know that. Care to 
elaborate?
I really need some guidance here. I just want to unify the epoll for various
event sources. It seems a lot of people like this, just look at the 
popularity
of libevent and other "unifying" event loops.
I don't think we need another epoll clone.
