  Just to explain a bit: I think that returning EINVAL is quite unexpected
for users in this case (I actually got a bugreport which turned out to be
this problem) and fallback to buffered IO seems to be a reasonable thing to
do. Probably it's not the cleanest solution but for FAT I think it's good
enough ;).
