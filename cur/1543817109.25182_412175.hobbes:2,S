The problem is simply that we don't expose acquire or release
ordering operations to AI kernel code (outside of locking, which
is a great wrapper). The reason is to avoid proliferation of all
these semantics.
If you do this then the powerpc guys will say they want all
their weird crap in there too. If you remove seperate read
and write barriers, then x86 and sparc64 folks will get upset
etc etc.
Changing semantics would probably require some fairly hefty
discussions. Can you first fix ia64, then (perhaps) introduce
lock semantics for the couple of bitops that can use it, then
can we see some performance justification for proposed
changes to the API?
