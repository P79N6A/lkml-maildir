Yanmin, how do you use volanomark; I got it from:
  
http://www.volano.com/benchmarks.html
and am using java-1.6.0-openjdk.x86_64
I installed it /dev/shm/vmark to avoid disk io ruining anying
But I'm getting very fluctuating results, from ~43000 msgs/s to 52000
msgs/s.
This makes it very hard to 'trust' this benchmark, let alone determine a
regression.
