Hi dear Linuxers,
After a week of investigation about XTP (Xpress Transfer Protocol), it
doesn't appear that it will ever be supported by the kernel, altough you
find a trace in net/socket.c (2.2.11, line 608, `#ifdef CONFIG_XTP', but
no such flag during kernel config).
Could someone point me to some additional source of information, if any
?
Thanks in advance
