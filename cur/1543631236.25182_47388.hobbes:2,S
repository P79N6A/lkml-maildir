Basically the goal is that contrary to some silly /proc
stuff which is "en vouge" nowadays you have the ability to
controll port access by using normal user permission control
semantics of unix file access permissions, by giving /dev/port
a proper group and so on. This is legacy crap of course, since
the above goal can be reached by using a apache-suexec alike wrapper
as well... even with more fine grained resolution of access controll.
