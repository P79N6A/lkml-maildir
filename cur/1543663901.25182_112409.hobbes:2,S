Please don't apply this patch -- for the following reasons:
- it only uses the deprecated, overloaded cpufreq proc_intf
- selecting the voltage within the policy (minimum and maximum frequency,
  mode of operation) is not where it should be done: you may want a
  different voltage at min-speed as at max-speed. So the frequency tables,
  or -even better- the amd-k7-specific table may be a better choice for
  this.
- selecting the voltage manually is something which is only valid for some
  very few drivers - so let's only export one sysfs file[*] for these
  drivers.

[*] sysfs is the _only_ recommended way to access cpufreq these days.
