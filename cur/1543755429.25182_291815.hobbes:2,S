Hi,
I was wondering how Windows handles high res timers, if at all.  The
reason I ask is because I have been reverse engineering a Windows ASIO
driver, and I find that if the latency is set below about 5ms, by
examining the kernel timer queue with SoftICE I can see that several
kernel timers with 1ms period are created.  (Presumably the sound card's
interval timer is used for longer periods).
But, I have seen people mention in the "singing capacitor" threads on
this list that Windows uses 100 for HZ.
So, how do they implement 1ms timers with a 10ms tick rate?  Does
Windows dynamically reprogram the PIT as well?
