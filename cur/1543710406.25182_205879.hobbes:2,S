Well I'll take it as being proof that forcing a particular style
doesn't help make bug-free code since it didn't help Microsoft.
I'll bet that Microsoft has more bugs per KLOC than any other
software, ever. It is a formidable challenge to make software
that will beat it in that area. You really need to try. You
need to be cunning enough to get it through the compile-stage.
It's an art.
