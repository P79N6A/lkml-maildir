Sure, that's fine, but as others have pointed out mime isn't the end all
to be all.  And I thought the discussion was about text stuff, not patches.
For patches, you'll be happy to know that BitKeeper supports wrapping and
unwrapping when you use email as your transport.  The following will wrap
the latest changes and apply them someplace else:
    $ bk send -wuu user@somewhere.com
On the other end
    $ cat mailmessage | bk receive ~/kernel	# this autounwraps
The wrapping code is as follows and people are welcome to it:
uuwrap:
	#!/bin/sh
	# uuwrap - the sending side of a uuencode stream
	exec uuencode bkpatch$$
unuuwrap:
	#!/bin/sh
	# unuuwrap - the receiving side of a uuencode stream
	cd /tmp
	TMP=unuu$$
	cat > $TMP
	uudecode $TMP
	set `grep '^begin ' $TMP`
	FILE=$3
	if [ ! -r $FILE ]
	then    chmod 0664 $FILE
	fi
	cat $FILE
	/bin/rm -f $FILE $TMP
	exit 0
