  Manufacturer = DataMyte, a division of Rockwell.
  Machine = DataMyte Industrial Digital Assistant 4000
            (aka DMIDA, www.dmida.com)
  Their co-operation came not from a spirit of enlightment but
because this was a commercial venture to port Linux to the box
to replace WinCE.  You can buy these with Linux now.
