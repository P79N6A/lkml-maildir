A couple of server boxes I use for testing kept hanging. So in the end 
I put a keyboard/mouse on the hanging boxes and bashed alt-scrolllock and
co a lot once it stopped.

Ok. Yes because we must either wait or succeed.

With 2.2.7 I've never seen it, with 2.2.9 and 2.2.9ac1 I see a hang every 24-36
hours. Both my test boxes hung on the same thing.

On the one box I was running a pile of assorted network and disk hogs
- repeatedly tarring the fs to /dev/null, find / etc
On the other it was basically an idle 6.0 box.
I'll rebuild with this changed and run some more tests
