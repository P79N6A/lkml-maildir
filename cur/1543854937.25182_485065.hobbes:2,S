This is not quite sufficient.  What we also need is a parameter which 
specifies which ring buffer the code assumes is currently active.  This 
is just like the EWOULDBLOCK error in the futex.  I.e., the kernel 
doesn't move the thread on the wait list if the index has changed. 
Otherwise asynchronous ring buffer filling is impossible.  Assume this
     thread                             kernel
     get current ring buffer idx
     front and tail pointer the same
                                        add new entry to ring buffer
                                        bump front pointer
     call kevent_wait()
With the interface above this leads to a deadlock.  The kernel delivered 
the event and is done with it.
If the kevent_wait() syscall gets an additional parameter which 
specifies the expected front pointer the kernel wouldn't put the thread 
to sleep since, in this case, the front pointer changed since last checked.
The kernel cannot and should not check the ring buffer is empty. 
Userlevel should maintain the tail pointer all by itself.  And even if 
the tail pointer is available to the kernel, the program might want to 
handle the queued events differently.
The above also comes to bear without asynchronous queuing if a thread 
waits for more than one event and it is possible to handle both events 
concurrently in two threads.
Passing in the expected front pointer value is flexible and efficient.
