Subject: Help, "neighbour table overflow" errors on production box

This is very strange. Mail still routes through the box and it can ping out,
but it can't ping itself either via localhost or by IP address.
This also seems to prevent NFS from working as well as VNC, but telnet and
FTP work wonderfully in both directions.
What the heck is going on here?
P75, 48MB RAM, 640MB disk, 64MB swap, EtherExpress Pro/100 NIC (82557 and
82559 chipsets have been tried)
Kernel 2.2.5-15 (stock RedHat kernel) as well as 2.2.7 both do this.
The odd thing is it happened very recently. I had some screwups with a
custom kernel and rebooted. depmod -a hung so I restarted the box. From then
on the system has given me that error.
Is it possible that disk corruption can lead to something like this? I can't
fathom how, but fsck did report an error which it fixed.
Please CC me any replies, though I do watch the archives as well.
