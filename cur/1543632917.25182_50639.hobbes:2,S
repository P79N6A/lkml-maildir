Note that this part is ok, as long as we make sure that the irq stack gets
initialized with a preempt_count > 0 (we must not preempt an interrupt
handler anyway, it wouldn't work), _and_ we make sure that taking the
interrupt also increments the "process native" preempt_count (so that
anybody looking at that preempt_count to determine whether it could be
preempted will also get a "nope, don't preempt me").
So that part doesn't look like a fundamental problem to me. It's just a 
"need to be careful" thing.
