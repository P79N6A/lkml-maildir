It's not horrible, but it's still broken.  There are people who depend
on UML being able to keep its own time separately from the host.

Yeah, it would be.
My preferred solution would be for libc to ask the kernel where the vsyscall
area is.  That's reasonably clean and virtualizable.  Andrea doesn't like it
because it adds a few instructions to the vsyscall address calculation.
