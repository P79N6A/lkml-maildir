A question that comes to mind every time I go through the settings
for "Preemption Model" and "Preempt The Big Kernel Lock".
Do each of the combinations "make sense", or are some "no-ops"?
For model, we have 1) no forced (server), 2) Voluntary (Desktop)
3) preemptible (low-latency Desktop), and for Big Lock Preemption (BLP),
we have "yes" or "no".
Questions:
1) What is the difference between "no forced" and "voluntary"?  Doesn't
  voluntary normally mean "not forced"?
2) If a process is not preemptible, then it seems this would be "doubly
  so" in the kernel when the big-lock is held.  So does the big-lock
  preemption question have any effect (when preempt-model="no forced").
3) If a process is "fully preemptible" but "BLP=false", is that
  much different than "voluntary preemption" & BLP=false?  I.e. --
  should 'preemptible kernel' also imply "BLP=true"...i.e.
_Should_ (would?) the following change be "somewhat" identical to
current config options:
  O1) "Preempt Model"="no-forced preemption" (would set
  preempt-big-kern-lock to FALSE and doesn't display that question).
  O2) "Voluntary Preemption" (presuming there are voluntary preemption
  points in the kernel in places where the big-K-lock is held), then
  configuration would still ask whether to  "Preempt The Big Kernel Lock".
  O3) "Preemptible model"="allow-kernel-preemption" (would set
  preempt-big-kern-lock to TRUE and doesn't display that question).
