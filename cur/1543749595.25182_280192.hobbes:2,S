Yes, users can be so dumb.  Commonly, the exchange goes like this:
USER: My device used to work in 2.6.7, and now it's busted.
US: Please turn on debugging and send us the logs.
USER: (sends dmesg which shows ub in use)
US: Turn off CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB
USER: It works!  You should make it more clear that UB breaks things...
And that's the optimal case.  Often times they cut the dmesg so we can't
see what's wrong.  And this usually takes 3 days for the entire exchange.

The best idea I have is to hide CONFIG_BLK_DEV_UB behind
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.
The next-best idea I have is to make UB print out some sort of warning
message at startup.
Neither of these ideas is very good, I'll admit.
