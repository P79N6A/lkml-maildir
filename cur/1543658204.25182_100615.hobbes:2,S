Subject: [2.5 patch] ALSA rme9652: remove __exit from hammerfall_free_buffers

Hi Jaroslav,
a mid-november ALSA update from you included a patch that added __exit 
to hammerfall_free_buffers in sound/pci/rme9652/hammerfall_mem.c. This 
patch is wrong since hammerfall_free_buffers is also called from the 
__init function alsa_hammerfall_mem_init resulting in a .exit.text 
linking error when trying to compile this driver statically into the 
kernel.
The following patch removes the __exit:
