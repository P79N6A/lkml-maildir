No, if it were 0, it would overwrite the atomic_set() immediately
above it.  I didn't think a comment was required since this is the
most obvious way to initialize a per-cpu counter to a total value.
I could add:
	/* Set one to the value, the others to zero */
If you missed it, others probably will, too.
Rusty.
