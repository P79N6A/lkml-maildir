Inspired by LWN article "Our [desktop] bloat problem" and a comment
about probability of finding unused prototype in kernel.
This is purely FYI.
   version   |   LOC   |    size   | nr_defines | nr_used | bloat |
             |  *.[ch] |   *.[ch]  |     [1]    |   [2]   |   %   |

Consider the numbers as zero-order approximation because of obvious
flaws in this "research":
* Once one layer of unused defines is removed, another appears
  (real bloat >= bloat).
* Possible ## obfuscation (real bloat <= bloat).
* _Of_course_, my regexp-fu sucks (real nr_defines != nr_defines).
* Counting doesn't understand that
	include/asm-alpha/unistd.h: #define FUBAR 1
	include/asm-sparc/unistd.h: #define FUBAR 1
   means "unused" (real bloat >= bloat).
* Some numbers in *.c files can be these unused defines
  (real bloat <= bloat).
HTH to not put every single piece of hardware spec into kernel next
time.
P. S.: regk_iop_sw_cfg_rw_fifo_out1_extra_owner_default, no less.

[1] As in
	find . -type f -name *.[ch]		| \
		xargs grep "#[\t ]*define[\t ]"	| \
		sed "s/.*#[\t ]*define[\t ]*//"	| \
		sed "s/[\t (].*//"		| \
		sort -u
[2] "used" means
	grep $DEFINE -w -r . | wc -l	>= 2
[3] Quite recent 2.6.13-rc6-git-something. I forgot [to cat down] exact version. 
[4] Not Linus's fault ;-). Remember about __NR_*.
