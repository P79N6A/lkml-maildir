That's the reason, why this whole discussion was considered void by a lot of
people: You need to be root in the first place in order to destroy the
harddisk. (And Andre always pointed to root exploits, when being told this.)
The point about CAPs is that you may rather easily load a module which can't
be unloaded and which would prevent to regain CAP_RAWIO ...
You could still come up with another module to hack this, but you may as
well disable module loading. Such things exist (secumod), but they are
seldomly used, as you also shut down a lot of functionality.

No, the destruction NEVER comes accidently. Or, say, with a probability of a
computer tunneling out of the window without destroying the glass.

Depends on the design of the firmware. Some firmware consist of two parts. A
unerasable part, which is mainly able to accept and checksum uploaded
firmware and the upgradeable firmware used for the normal operation. If you
happen to have such a design, you are lucky; just download the correct
firmware, if you get hold of it.
I'm afraid most firmwares will not be designed that way and also allow you
to erase the part which is needed to get newer firmware in the drive. Or
screw up communication so badly that the download will not work any more.
So, no remedy by software only!
