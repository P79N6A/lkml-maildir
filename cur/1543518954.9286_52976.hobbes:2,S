It may be that previous versions let you get away with muddy code.
There are several problems with the test code.

Here, the length of sa2, passed to accept via sa2_len is undefined.
The length should be initialized to the length of the structure so
accept() knows how much space is available. Accept() is probably
getting a 0, returning a bogus error-code.
