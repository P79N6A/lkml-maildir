The following patch (which reverts part of 2.4.20-pre2) seems to fix my
pl2303 oopsing (and let me use the device properly again) in 2.4.20-pre2
through -pre5. This patch doesn't work with -pre6 or up though (due to
white space differences and, more importantly, the removal of all 6
variables referenced in the if-statement).
Anyway, I'm posting this in case it provides another clue as to what's
not working.
