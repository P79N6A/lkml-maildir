IMO, the non-LKML lists exist so that developers can go off and have long,
boring, highly technical discussions without everyone having to wade through
it. It's not private email, it's just another list. So, subscribe, or look
at the archives. Most people don't care about this stuff, so the ones that
do should opt-in to whatever list.

I am not positive that your initial premise is entirely correct. For
example, it's way too early to say definitively, but right now I don't see
ACPI or power management requiring any changes to the module architecture.
(Driver arch maybe, but not module arch)
So, maybe you should just copy the two lists (hotplug and security) in
question?
