Yes, that fixed it:

Did something has changed between 2.6.16 and 2.6.17 regarding TCP window
scaling ?
I remember a discussion on lklm aroung 2.6.7 or so that finally ended as
a bug in a firewall that wasn't handling TCP window scaling gracefully.
That's certainly my case, I'll will have a look to that.
Thanks for the help,
