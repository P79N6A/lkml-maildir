Note that it's not just this particular hunk, all these kinds of conditional
passing are wrong.

But anyway, creating fake nameidata structures is not really helpful.
If there is a nameidata passed people expect it to be complete, and
if you pass them to an LSM people will e.g. try to look into lookup
intents.  But similar to the per-mountpoint r/o work I suspect you're
simply operating on the wrong level, but then again this might not
be fixable due to the braindead apparmor design.
