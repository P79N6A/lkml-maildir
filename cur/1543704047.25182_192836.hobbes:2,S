Honestly, can a list be considered a contact point at all if you can't
post to it? If they are so afraid of outside posters, they can setup a
specific list for bug reporting only thats open or something. IMHO
allowing closed lists to be listed in the MAINTAINERS file is
to support the stupidity.
Cheers,
