I think it does:
-               mutex_init(&ei->truncate_mutex);
-               inode_init_once(&ei->vfs_inode);
-       }
-}
And fs/ext2/super.c:init_once() from 2.6.21-mm2 says:
                mutex_init(&ei->truncate_mutex);
                inode_init_once(&ei->vfs_inode);
        }
}
Hmm?

Ok. I would appreciate any kind of heads-up when you're ready to eat
these patches again. ;-)
