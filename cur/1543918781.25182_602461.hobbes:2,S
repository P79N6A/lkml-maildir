Hm, well, I could only compile a i686 kernel and Intel chipset with 
"otherwise the same" config with these two compiler options to test... 
Maybe some time. No, I do not have another C7 system.

Well, this very system has been running git and compiling kernels for 
itself the whole day today without a single issue. The gcc-3.3.5 
miscompiled kernel was compiled on another machine. So, I hope my specific 
sample is stable. And I need it to be stable, because I'm going to run my 
mail-server on it... BTW, compiled a tickless kernel on it, so far without 
looking into user-space after 12 min uptime 40290 timer interrupts, i.e., 
17Hz, not bad.
As for sensors - my system seems to have a w83627ehf chip, "sensors" 
output (under 2.6.22) looks pretty funny too:
# sensors

Maybe at least CPU Temp. at least correlates with the real value:-) Yes, 
I'll look in BIOS next time I boot with a connected monitor and a 
keyboard.
Thanks for the info!
