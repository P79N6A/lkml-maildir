This patch is wrong.
We already _have_ the pagevec for page table teardown, and by making it a 
per-CPU static structure instead of allocating it on the stack it can be 
made (and is) quite a lot bigger than a pvec.
If you want batching here, then the right approach is to just remove the
"fast" code entirely, and batch it properly at the TLB struct level (since
we _have_ to batch it there anyway, to fix the the thread unmapping TLB
race condition)
This is what "tlbgather" is all about.
