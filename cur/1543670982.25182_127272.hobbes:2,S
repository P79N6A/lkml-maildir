How do they provide  "experimental" versions of this feature?  I don't
see how this can be done without major fileystem surgery, so it
kindof must be an OSS implementation..

Well, this is not doable ontop of any existing kernel without major
suregery (introducing a credential cache and passing it down to
every place that's doing uid/gid based access control).
So none of the CGL distros can really support that.
