The performance problem, both from application and kernel viewpoints, when
a large number of resources is to be waited for, indeed affect
performances.  Note that you may try to maintains bit/descriptor maps by
only applying differences when it is possible and, for the select() case,
you are not required to scan all bits if you keep track in your
applications of all active resources using some list for example. But this
is indeed a weak and poor optimization.

If the old semantic can be reproduced using some wrapper code, you donnot
break existing applications, but may-be you can affect performances a bit. 
Note that sockets emulation over streams has already broken some
application in a subtle way. I know of applications that have been very
confused with some emulated getsockopt()/setsockopt() that had been
internally interrupted by some signal.

You can select on message queues on AIX, IIRC, but this is not portable. 
MVS accepts additionnal parameters for the select() that allows to also
wait for events on other types of resources (in the case you really want
to use select under this O/S). 
Using select() and une unique message queue for read is possible with
conjunction of SIGIO/SIGALRM with the risk of the application to lose time
if it has very bad luck. 
You can implement something like that: 
If you expect event(s) from fds (basically SIGIO will kick ass you)
1)     set an alarm of a few seconds (<=2 seconds for example)
       also set the alarm from the alarm handler.
2)     get next message in blocking mode
3)     if interrupted go with poll/select the fds
       (can be either SIGIO or SIGALRM)
If you are so unfortunate that the SIGIO occurs between 1 and 2, your 
program will only be stuck for less than 1..2 seconds.
(The period between (1) and (2) that may let msgrcv block can be minimized
by some additionnal code). 
By the way, this works for me since 10 years in some applications, and I
never have been able to get the problem in my testings. Indeed it is not
clean and not optimal at all, but when you haven't the choice such a
band-aid is really helpfull.
