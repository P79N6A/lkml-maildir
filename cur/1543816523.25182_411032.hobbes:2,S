Subject: [2.6 PATCH 0/2]: Cleanup/Update FTDI_SIO

Hi all,
Stirred by the patch from Folkert van Heusden [1], I had a look at the
code and thought it might see a bit of cleanup before adding the patch
from [1]...
So here is a series of two incremental patches:
[2.6 PATCH 1/2]: ftdi_sio.h whitespace cleanup
[2.6 PATCH 2/2]: add support for Papouch TMU (USB thermometer)
they'll be posted as a reply to this one.
I couldn't figure who the maintainer is, so not CC-ing anybody.
