  Because there is still memory on the video board, the display stay
 at whatever refresh the video board is set up, 80 Hz if you want.
 That is updating the video memory from main memory which is at 10 Hz,
 if a dot is displayed in another color for a duration of 0.01 second
 (100 Hz), the human eye will not see it, so there is no need to
 display it.
 I am _not_ a specialist of the eye, but if something is displayed for
 less than 1/10 of a second, I am not sure to see it. So I can probably
 accept to have a 100 ms delay in between a click and the associated
 window appearing.
  Etienne.
