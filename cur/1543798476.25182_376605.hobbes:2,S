Nah, I never did Mac development ;-)
IIRC, this change originally came from maclinux CVS (which predates Linux/m68k
CVS by several years) via email. If you wait a few hours, the original author
probably will start yelling ;-)
Alternatively, I can dig up my email archives from before 2000 to identify
him....

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
