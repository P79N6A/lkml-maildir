Fine, thank you. This makes it really useful.

Of course (although cp will be terminated by the SIGINT anyway, so it
does not matter in this situation).
Do I understand this correctly that sendfile now behaves like write with
SA_RESTART not set for the signal? If so, it might perhaps make sense to
add SA_RESTART semantics too, so that sendfile then just continues if the
process catches the signal and does not abort (scenario: SIGWINCH is sent
to a curses-based file manager).
