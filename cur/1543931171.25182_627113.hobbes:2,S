likely caused by this patch:
  Subject: unify non-paravirt parts of desc.h
_please_ be more careful when unifying. Do check the before/after 
vmlinux - the binary size at least. And watch out for compiler warnings 
as well:
 arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c: In function 'read_32bit_tls':
 arch/x86/kernel/process_64.c:454: warning: passing argument 1 of 'get_desc_base' from incompatible pointer type
i've pulled the patches from the tree for now.
