I have posted about this earlier.
I have a problem with my laptop, a Dell Latitude CPi A
PII 366, and a 3Com 3c589 PCMCIA card. After some time
I can't initiate new network connections because of 
lack of buffers.
when I try telneting to a host I get:
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: No buffer space available
Also in the logs i get many of these:
Dec  8 17:19:13 km-lt kernel: dst cache overflow 
Dec  8 17:19:52 km-lt last message repeated 9 times
Dec  8 17:19:52 km-lt last message repeated 3 times
.config attached. Versions 2.3.28-30 (haven't tried the earlier
2.3.x kernels on this box)
I first though this could be due to me reconfiguring the adapter
between home and work and just deactivating / activating the
adapter, but I don't think I did this the last time it happened
Cheers
