	The Home-PNA cards look like ethernet cards to the kernel.
	Does the specification tell something about the PROTOCOLS
	to be run, that I have not checked.
	For example, the Tulip driver (www.scyld.com) understands
	PHY interface called Home-PNA.
	Comparing to the Ethernet (10/100/1000/more Mbit/sec),
	the Home-PNA runs at 1 Mbit/sec.  (And thus can use
	in-house CAT-3 telephony cabling.)
