My point being that vesafb is used for maximum compatibility, when you
have no other way to drive an unknown framebuffer.  It's the emergency
backup driver.  Shouldn't it be robust when faced with an unknown
framebuffer type, new or old?
Granted if there are only two cards with this problem and we are
confident that no other cards have the problem, a PCI ID would do it.
