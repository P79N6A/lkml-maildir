Did you pre-create the file? I've been doing something quite similar since
about test6, although I use ext2 and aes I don't suspect that matters. But
I did preallocate the file with dd first. I assume you did that, since you
don't give a size in mkfs, but better to mention it.

I've run both dead stock test releases, -mm, and most recently a mix of
Nick and Con scheduler and io patches.
