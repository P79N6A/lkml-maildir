And you have no idea what size screen they have.  Some text users I know 
like to keep their screens at 60 chars so they can fit more terms on 
their desktop.  Others have 100+ columns.  Let the end user flow the 
text according to their own wishes.
Basic concept in good content presentation, you provide the content and 
style, let the reader render it according to their page 
characteristics.  Don't try to force everyone into 640x480, 72 columns, 
or a particular text size.
