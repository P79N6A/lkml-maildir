Hi!
I've rather nice machine (elonex ws-425x), unfortunately it comes with
netware bootrom, which is in system rom (not easy to replace). It is
not equipped with floppy or hdd, and connectors are non-standard.
Therefore I'd like to network boot it... However I've no netware
server to watch. Could someone network boot machine using netware,
capture whole session using 
tcpdump -xi eth0 
and send results to me? It should be rather easy to emulate initial
handshake and use mars (netware emulator) to boot workstation...
