There is definitely something wrong, I tried all sorts of options now,
and a second machine, and I can never get the behavior you see. I even
booted with init=/bin/sh.
But true, looking at the kobject debugging for loop devices, and usb
storage driven by the ub driver, all looks fine without the additional
put.
There must be something going wrong with the block patch in conjunction
with the crazy SCSI release logic. Can you send me your .config? Just
for a check, maybe you have some option, enabled/disabled that changes
the behavior, and possibly brings us closer to find the bug.
Thanks,
Kay
