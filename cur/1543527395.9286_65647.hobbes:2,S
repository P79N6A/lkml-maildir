Hi,
I just installed a slackware 7.0 with the sym538xx driver
and have no trouble (kernel 2.2.13), but when I upgraded 
to the 2.2.15-pre10 the kernel just hang in the second part
of the scsi device detection (where it show the 'geometry') 
for an old drive.
It stop just after
sym53c810a-0-<1,*>: FAST-10 SCSI 10.0 MB/s (100 ns, offset 8)
SCSI device sda: hdwr sector= 512 bytes. Sectors= 4201304 [2051 MB] [2.1
GB]
sym53c810a-0-<2,*>: FAST-5 SCSI 5.0 MB/s (200 ns, offset 8)
and never show the next line for an old SEGEATE 1480 (424 Mo)
I'll try to have more information tomorow.
Thanks in advance.
