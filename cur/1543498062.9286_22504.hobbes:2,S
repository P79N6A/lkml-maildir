   Try working in wrongendian 24bit mode for a while Dave, its _horrible_ trying
   to get the byte shifting and flipping right for 3 bytes/pixel packed. Thats
   hard to do efficiently on ppc
No no no, I realize this Alan, surely it's horrible.
But my commentary (and I thought Jes's) was in the light of having the
hardware transparently handle the endianness for you, be that via
explicit load/store attributes or special MMU mappings.
Do things make sense to you with this in mind?
