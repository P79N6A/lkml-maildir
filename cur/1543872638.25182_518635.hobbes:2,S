Thanks very much for that comprehensive summary and testing!

Well... are you advocating we change sched_yield semantics to a
gentler form? This is a cinch to implement but I know how Ingo feels
about this. It will only encourage more lax coding using sched_yield
instead of proper blocking (see huge arguments with the ldap people on
this one who insist it's impossible not to use yield).

Ok I don't think there's any actual accounting problem here per se
(although I did just recently post a bugfix for rsdl however I think
that's unrelated). What I think is going on in the ccache testcase is
that all the work is being offloaded to kernel threads reading/writing
to/from the filesystem and the make is not getting any actual cpu
time. This is "worked around" in mainline thanks to the testing for
sleeping on uninterruptible sleep in the interactivity estimator. What
I suspect is happening is kernel threads that are running nice -5 are
doing all the work on make's behalf in the setting of ccache since it
is mostly i/o bound. The reason for -nice values on kernel threads is
questionable anyway. Can you try renicing your kernel threads all to
nice 0 and see what effect that has? Obviously this doesn't need a
recompile, but is simple enough to implement in kthread code as a new
default.

Ew. It's probably not a bug but a good example of some of the
starvation scenarios we're hitting on mainline (hence the need for a
rewrite ;))
Thanks!
