As I've suggested earlier in this thread:
=========================================
I suspect that spreading evenly over the current tasks mems_allowed is
just what is needed.
There is nothing special about big Altix systems here; just use
task->mems_allowed.  For all but tasks using MPOL_BIND, this means
spreading the caching over the nodes in the tasks cpuset.
We don't want to spread over a larger area, because cpusets need to
maintain a fairly aggressive containment.  One jobs big data set must
not pollute the cpuset of another job, except in cases involving kernel
distress.
Let the cpusets define what is "the right size" to spread across.
We do not need additional kernel heuristics or options to decide this.
