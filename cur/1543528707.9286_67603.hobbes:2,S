Hi,
	I want to pass file descriptors between two processes.I read 
man cmsg where the code for sending fds is given.But how do I receive
them.I have tried the following one, but not working.Can anybody please
help me.
----- CODE start ---
              struct msghdr msg = {0};
              struct cmsghdr *cmsg;
              int myfds[NUM_FD];/* Contains the file descriptors to rcv.*/
              char buf[CMSG_SPACE(sizeof myfds)];/* ancillary data buffer*/
              int *fdptr;
              msg.msg_control = buf;
              msg.msg_controllen = sizeof buf;
              cmsg = CMSG_FIRSTHDR(&msg);
              cmsg->cmsg_level = SOL_SOCKET;
              cmsg->cmsg_type = SCM_RIGHTS;
              cmsg->cmsg_len = CMSG_LEN(sizeof(int) * NUM_FD);
		
	      if( recvmsg( socket, &msg, 0 ) < 0 )
		    return -1; 	
              fdptr = (int *)CMSG_DATA(cmsg);
              memcpy(myfds, fdptr, NUM_FD * sizeof(int));
----- CODE ends  ----------
TIA.
 -Srinath.
