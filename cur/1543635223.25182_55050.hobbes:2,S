andrea & i discussed this off-list a few days ago... see fs/fcntl.c
                case F_SETFL:
                        lock_kernel();
                        err = setfl(fd, filp, arg);
                        unlock_kernel();
setfl() does:
        if ((arg ^ filp->f_flags) & FASYNC) {
                if (filp->f_op && filp->f_op->fasync) {
                        error = filp->f_op->fasync(fd, filp, (arg & FASYNC) != 0);
and:
        if (arg & O_DIRECT) {
                down(&inode->i_sem);
                if (!filp->f_iobuf)
                        error = alloc_kiovec(1, &filp->f_iobuf);
                up(&inode->i_sem);
and finally:
        filp->f_flags = (arg & SETFL_MASK) | (filp->f_flags & ~SETFL_MASK);
i pointed out that if alloc_kiovec slept, the BKL provides no protection
against someone else doing a setfl at the same time, so we can get the
wrong number of fasync events sent.  Marcus Alanen pointed out that
fasync can also sleep, so we're at risk anyway.  i don't think that
abusing i_sem as andrea did is the Right Thing to do...
