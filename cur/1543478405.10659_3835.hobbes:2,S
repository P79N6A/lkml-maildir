Bingo!
Good debugging, I'm thankful and impressed.

I would suggest the simpler fix of just moving the "add_wait_queue()"
until after the down_interruptible test - that way there is nothing to
remove, and we really only want the read_wait queue to be around the
while-loop that follows. 
Anyway, thanks for noticing and fixing it,
