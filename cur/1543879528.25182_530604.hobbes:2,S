OK, that's fine, thanks for the info...
but trying 'make mrproper' gives me:
make -f scripts/Makefile.clean obj=Documentation/DocBook
make -f scripts/Makefile.clean obj=Documentation/DocBook/man/
make[2]: execvp: /bin/sh: Argument list too long
make[2]: *** [__clean] Error 127
make[1]: *** [Documentation/DocBook/man/] Error 2
make: *** [_mrproper_Documentation/DocBook] Error 2
DocBook/man/ contains about 2000 files.
Is there some way to have scripts/Makefile.clean just do
	rm -rf Documentation/DocBook/man/
?  or some other solution?
