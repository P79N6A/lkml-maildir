Yes that's safe.

Yep.
Yeah that was buggy, see later posting (which had a barrier = 1 hanging
from update, argh). Here's a better version imho. I have one drive here
that does support FLUSH_CACHE, but doesn't flag cfs_enable_2 as such. So
I think our logic should be:
        /*
         * decide if we can sanely support flushes and barriers on
         * this drive. unfortunately not all drives advertise
         * FLUSH_CACHE
         * support even if they support it. So assume FLUSH_CACHE is
         * there
         * if write back caching is enabled. LBA48 drives are newer, so
         * expect it to flag support properly. We can safely support
         * FLUSH_CACHE on lba48, if capacity doesn't exceed lba28
         */
        barrier = drive->wcache;
        if (drive->addressing == 1) {
                barrier = ide_id_has_flush_cache(id);
                if (capacity > (1ULL << 28) && !ide_id_has_flush_cache_ext(id))
                        barrier = 0;
        }
