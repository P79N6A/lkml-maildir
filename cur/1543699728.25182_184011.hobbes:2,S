You are correct, however it would be a miniscule cost advantage,
possibly outweighed by the shared lock, and overhead of more
changing of CPUs (I'm sure there would be some cost).

Shared runqueues could be built from that model

Sorry I didn't follow, gain and complexity of what?
Earlier in the thread Ingo thought my approach is simpler. code size is the
same size, object size for my patch is significantly smaller, and it does
more. Benchmarks have so far shown that my patch is as performant as shared
runqueues.
