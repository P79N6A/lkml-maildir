So basically, you're just turning the per-processor data into a tree?

The shared memory clustering people are basically trying to make 
mmap+semaphores work across a high speed LAN.  Why?  Because it's cheap, and 
the programming model's familiar.
Approaching it all from a different direction, though.  Probably not of help
