In another thread someone made a mention that this problem may have
something to do with the pools of memory being used for sendfile. The
readahead from sendfile is going into a moderately sized pool. When
you get 100 of them going at once the other threads flush the
readahead data out of the pool before it can be used and thus trigger
the thrashing seek storm. Is this true, that sendfile data is read
ahead into a fixed sized pool? If so, the readahead algorithms would
need to reduce the sendfile window sizes to stop the pool from
thrashing.
