Hmm, neither slabinfo nor meminfo show the machine being under any stress.
Were they generated while the problem was happening?
The useful information would be to collect meminfo and slabinfo while
kswapd and updated are spinning. Also, cpuinfo doesn't ever change,
(at least while being run on the same box) so you can leave that out.
BTW, oopses tracing back into the VM doesn't help. It's usually someone
doing something wrong the VM checks for. In this case I'll bet someone
(i.e. LVM) called vmalloc() with interrupts off.
