No special measures are taken to level block allocation. Wandered blocks
are allocated to improve packing i.e., place blocks of the same file
close to each other. Actually, it tries to place tree nodes in the
parent-first order.

It should automatically replay journal on the mount. fsck.reiser4 is
still needed owing to the bugs in the implementation, but, I am afraid,
it cannot do much at the moment.
