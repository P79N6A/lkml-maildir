Now that we are at that, it might be wise to add a higher-than-anything
priority that the kernel code can use (what would be 100 for user space,
but off-limits), so even FIFO 99 code in user space cannot block out
the migration thread, keventd and friends.

I agree with that, but the consequence is kind of ugly; not that a true
real-time embedded process is going to be printing to the console, but 
it might be outputting to a serial line, so now they rely on the keventd.
BTW, I have seen similar problems wrt to the migration thread, where a
FIFO 20 process would get stuck in CPU1, that is taken by a FIFO 40
while CPU0 was running a FIFO 10 -- however, I am not that positive
that it is a migration thread problem; I blame it more on the scheduler
not taking into account priorities for firing the load balancer. It is
a tricky thingie, though. Affinity helps, in this case.
