Ok, I'll look at the x86-64 code

This patch was not meant to be a definitive fix for do_gettimeofday.
I thought having diffrent locks  on the same cacheline was bad. Atleast, 
I don't think there'd be any negative performance impact due to my patch.  
Pls correct me if I am wrong. 
I want to get some nos too .. and probably will...(still waiting for my 
turn to use the 4way here :-) ).  But, I decided to post this patch 
as a follow up to the 2.5 profiler discussion on lse-tech.  
Anywayz, point taken. Next time I submit an optimization patch to you,
I'll post the measuements too.
Thanks,
Kiran
