I don't think the embedded folks are going to be ok with adding a 64-bit
div in the poll() common-path... But otherwise the patch looks pretty
sane, except I think you want s64, not int64_t? I can't ever remember
myself :)
I agree the interface mght be mis-defined. And changing timeout_msecs()
to an integer is consistent with the size of millisecond-unit variables
used elsewhere in the kernel.
Thanks,
Nish
