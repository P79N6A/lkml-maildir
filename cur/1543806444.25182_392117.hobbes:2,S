Btw, Linas - even if you can't fix your broken mail setup, what you _can_ 
do is to always make sure that the patches you send out have
	From: Linas Vepstas <linas@austin.ibm.com>
as the first line of the body - then the tools will figure out to use that 
instead of the broken mail headers. Ok?
(This is true in general - so anybody else who knows that they send out 
emails from a strange address that they'd rather have show up as their 
"real" email address instead in the changelogs can do the same).

PS. It's _damn_ hard to type "Linas". Every time, that "a" just becomes an 
"u" for me. My fingers obviously have certain things hard-coded ;)
