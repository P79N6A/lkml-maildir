Yes but thats not very generic is it? Im not the only one with this

What makes you think writes to the 32K SRAM are any slower than to the
SDRAM? the device is completely memory mapped.

Again its a suboptimal solution, and on an architecture where the CPU
isnt *that* fast in the first place it seems wrong to deliberately
choose the slowest possible route...
