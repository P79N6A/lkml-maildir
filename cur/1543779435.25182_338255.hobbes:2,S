I have had a fair amount of trouble with the limited support
for ecc reporting on higher end dual and quad cpu servers as
the reporting is pretty weak.
On the opterons I can tell which cpu gets errors, but mcelog
does not isolate things down to the dimm level properly, is
there a way to do this sort of thing?   I am talking about most
of the whitebox type motherboards.
On the newer Intels I have not found any useable ECC support
is there any in the kernels?
I can test a variety of hardware if someone needs it, and can
probably even come up with some test memory that will generate ecc
errors.
