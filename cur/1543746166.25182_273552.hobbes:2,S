Just to clarify:
I have no problem with special-casing signals sent to a specific
thread.  Our garbage collector uses pthread_kill, and thus should
also benefit from that change.  And it makes sense to me that this
kind of signal should be cheaper to deliver.
SIGSEGV delivery also matters to me.  But that should presumably
also fall into the same class.
I would prefer to avoid special handling for just SIGPROF.
If that was never proposed, please ignore my comments.
