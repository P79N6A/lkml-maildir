As there is NO CKRM cpu controller in 2.6.13-rc3-mm1 (that I can see) 
the one in 2.6.5 is certainly more sophisticated :-).  So the reason 
that the considerable mangling of sched.c evident in SuSE's 2.6.5 kernel 
source is not present is that the cpu controller is not included in 
these patches.
I imagine that the cpu controller is missing from this version of CKRM 
because the bugs introduced to the cpu controller during upgrading from 
2.6.5 to 2.6.10 version have not yet been resolved.
