While I was the one who initially had the "trouble", I was thankful for
having a "Switch It On by Default" option. I don't exactly know what the
patch did to the IDE subsystem (personally I'm not really into IDE...),
but I'd unhide a problem (either my dumb drive/controller setup or a bug
in Linux' IDE code) and so - one more bug down (at least from my point
of view). That's a good thing, IMHO.
This *is* why I'm using 2.5.x - there's actually a chance to easily find
bugs with everybody's hardware:)
MfG, JBG
