The "Leave space between name and *" is confusing.  Does 'name'
refer to the type or variable.  I hope Michael was not recommending:
	char * p;
How about saying:
	Do not leave a space between a * and the following
	variable name, nor between multiple *, when used
	to declare pointers:
		char *p;
		struct foo **bar;
