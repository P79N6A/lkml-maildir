Out of interest, how does this work? Not obvious to me since an NFSv3
filehandle is too big for an NFSv2 server.

Sounds likely, since basically the whole machine locked up and no
futher fs operations seemed to be happening. I haven't checked whether
2.4 also shows the problem - I just fixed it in my code and then it
obviously did not happen anymore.
I can test patches or also send you my code if you want to test
things yourself. It's also available online, UNFS3 project at
SourceForge, but that's of course a version with working FSSTAT.
