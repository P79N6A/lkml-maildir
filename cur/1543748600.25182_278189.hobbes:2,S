That is ok.  Either we have interrupts off and no softirqs are pending and we 
proceed to the "hlt" (where the interrupt will be taken), or softirqs are 
pending, we turn interrupts on, do the softirq, turn interrupts off and try 
again.  Unless some tasklet (RCU?) never "gives up" or we will exit the while 
with interrupts off and move on to the "hlt".  Or did I miss something?
