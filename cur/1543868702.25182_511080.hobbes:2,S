I guess I kind of hijacked the thread. The second part of my first email was
dropped. Basically I was saying that I'm working on CPU isolation extensions.
Where an isolated CPU is not supposed to do much kernel work. In which case
you'd want to run slab cache reaper on some other CPU on behalf of the isolated
one. Hence the proposal to explicitly pass cpu_id to the reaper. I guess now
that you guys fixed the hotplug case it does not help in that scenario.
