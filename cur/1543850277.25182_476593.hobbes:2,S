I see a problem with that; not sure if that's what Christoph is objecting
to.  What about access to cache tree by root process that has nothing
to do with that daemon?  Should it get free access to that stuff, regardless
of what policy might say about access to cached files?  Or should we at
least try to make sure that we have the instances in cache no more permissive
than originals on NFS?
