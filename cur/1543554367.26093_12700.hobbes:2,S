I guess all customers are idiots then, since about 100+ people who were
using our release downloaded it, and had these problems with sendmail.  This
disconnect of yours is about what I would expect from someone in a University.
Some of us don't have the luxury of being able to pontificate in a Univ
environment -- we have to make a living from Linux -- and provide payroll
for the people on this list who actually do the core work on Linux.  
If there were not a commercialization effort around Linux, it would still
be unknown, like TMOK or a lot of other kernels sitting in universities
somewhere not being deployed.  It's the commercialization effort that made
Linux a household word.  NT and NetWare servers don't stop forwarding 
emails when the load average gets too high -- they just work out of the
box, and hopefully, no so will Linux (our distribution does now since 
this problem in fixed).
Now we know that sendmail has problems on Linux based on the this load
average interpretation, which we would not have known if someone had 
not raised the issue.
