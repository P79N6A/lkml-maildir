Subject: [BUG] Ramdisk is broken with 2.4.19-pre6/8

Hello,
I've build a 2 disk set following the 
http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Bootdisk-HOWTO/
instructions. This works well with < 2.4.19-pre6 kernels but 2.4.19-pre6 just
doesn't read the 2nd floppy disk (the ramdisk).
I noticed that 2.4.19-pre6 try to read from floppy before prompting for the
ramdisk and <2.4.19-pre6 never did that.
Once i press enter with the 2.4.19-pre6, the kernel seems to do nothing. No
kernel panic, no oops. It just does nothing. The floppy leds is switched on
3s or 5s and then is switched off.
Alt+SysRq+T gives me 5 usual tasks in Sleeping mode :
[ksoftirqd_CPU0]
[kswapd]
[kupdated]
[keventd]
[bdflush]
and one active task called swapper (never heard about that one).
This last task is still in R state.
This bug is still present in 2.4.19-pre8 (tested, same behaviour).
Regards
PS : Can you cc me the answers as i not a lkml subscriber. Thx
