In the 32-bit case, I'm pretty sure those are guaranteed not to fail 
because 32-bit is the default. For the 64-bit ones, we don't care if 
they fail, because then we'll just use whatever mask ends up being set 
(we store the actual set DMA mask in adma_dma_mask for use when we need 
to reconfigure the bounce limit). We definitely don't want to fail 
initialization if the 64-bit set doesn't succeed..
