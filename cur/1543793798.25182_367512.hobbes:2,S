It's sad, but I still don't understand the way it should be fixed.
Removal of VM_RESERVED is certainly not a solution, since we don't going
to swap mmaped pages and VM_RESERVED is used in other drivers (for
example, some sound drivers)
So, we need to find the problem itself. After looking at the code I've
found that the x86_64 dependency of that problem lies in the check in
memory.c:get_user_pages
if (vma && in_gate_area (task, start))
x86_64 defines it's own arch-dependant function in_gate_area which fails
in our case. Can someone trace that code and find why do we fail and
fail only on x86_64. It would be nice if someone could point me to
get_user_pages documentation, why it's so differently behaves for 64 bit
arch.
Also it seems that I had traces of video-buf module with debug enabled
on 64 bit, but lost them. Can someone just enable debug option to video-
buf module and collect those traces.
