Hi Rusty,
I've seen a symbol-resolving race on s390. The qeth module uses symbols
from qdio and although the loading order seems correct and the qdio
symbols should be available the following error appears:
qdio: loading QDIO base support version 2
qeth: Unknown symbol qdio_synchronize
qeth: Unknown symbol do_QDIO
qeth: Unknown symbol qdio_initialize
qeth: Unknown symbol qdio_cleanup
qeth: Unknown symbol qdio_activate
qeth: Unknown symbol qdio_synchronize
qeth: Unknown symbol do_QDIO
qeth: Unknown symbol qdio_initialize
qeth: Unknown symbol qdio_cleanup
qeth: Unknown symbol qdio_activate
qeth: loading qeth S/390 OSA-Express driver
qeth: Device 0.0.f5f0/0.0.f5f1/0.0.f5f2 is a OSD Express card (level: 087a) with link type OSD_1000 (portname: OSAPORT)
qeth: Hardware IP fragmentation not supported on eth0
qeth: VLAN enabled 
qeth: Multicast enabled
qeth: IPV6 enabled 
qeth: Broadcast enabled 
qeth: Using SW checksumming on eth0.
qeth: Outbound TSO enabled
After that both drivers work fine but I'm curious why this happens.
Cheers,
Jan
