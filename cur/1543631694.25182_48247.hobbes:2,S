  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        This, I believe is what is causing it. in looking through the 2.5.18 
patch, this is new to the kernel, and is a newly configurable option to the 
kernel. For testing, I could see you adding it in, but you need this? 
especially if you have APM or ACPI? This doesn't rely on those, but if you're 
using APM or ACPI for suspend, this really wouldn't be needed.
                                                        BL.
