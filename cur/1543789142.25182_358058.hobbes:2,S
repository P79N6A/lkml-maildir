I don't think it's shown signs of stabilizing quite yet.  Each revision
has new code that needs to be cleaned up, and new obvious CodingStyle
issues.  Let's see a couple of incrementally cleaner releases go by,
which don't have renewed old issues, and then we can think about asking
to get it merged elsewhere.
