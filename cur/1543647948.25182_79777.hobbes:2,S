we have all this problems on m68k as well (except that our speed
constraints aren't so terribly strict), don't give up too quickly.
A possible solution is to generate multiple object file from the
same source using a different set of defines for each one. The kbuild
system can already handle it using the CFLAGS_$@ rule and asm/io.h
can then select the appropriate macros for inb etc.
Where it starts to be more interesting is when there are module 
interdependecies (like ne.c and e8390.c) or all the object files 
are to be be linked into kernel. Perhaps EXPORT_SYMBOL() and 
INIT_MODULE() could be tweaked to mangle the names according to 
some special define.
