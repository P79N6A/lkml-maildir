rwsems unfortunately help you zilch; an rwsem is just a mutex with a
performance tweak, but from the deadlock perspective it's really a
mutex.
I'm really starting to feel that the hotplug lock would have been better
of being a refcount (with a waitqueue for zero) than a lock. While
"refcount+waitqueue" sort of IS a lock, the semantics make more sense
imo...
