man `badblocks`
Also, if you has a BIOS screen when the machine is booting, that
are tools for SCSI (Adaptec has this), then you can use the
SCSI disk utility to replace any bad blocks. Generally, it
reads everything and relocates anything it can't read. You
man end up with corrupt files, but the disk ends up clean.
