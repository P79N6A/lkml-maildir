In this case I think you may have something.  There is always
the chance that Al will still pipe in with "not doing that can
be exploited as a race condition by doing X, Y, and Z".

You could always just put an "else" in front of the zeroing, so
it looks like:
	if (pde)
                pde->rec_len = cpu_to_le16(to-from);
	else
		dir->inode = 0;
Let us know how it turns out (I think it will be OK).
Cheers, Andreas
