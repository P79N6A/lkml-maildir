Subject: removing all "R/W" content from all semaphore.h files?

(can anyone comment on whether i'm thinking about this clearly?)
  as i read it, there is no need for *any* of the semaphore.h files to
include "<linux/rwsem.h>" anymore, since R/W sems now have their own
header file <linux/rwsem.h>.  so i recently submitted a patch to
delete all those inclusions from all semaphore.h files.  IMHO, that's
a fairly safe and reasonable change -- anyone who specifically wants a
R/W semaphore should be including the appropriate header file for it
and not be picking up that definition thru semaphore.h.
  however, some of those semaphore.h files also include the macro
definition:
  #define RW_LOCK_BIAS             0x01000000
that *also* strikes me as inappropriate content for generic
semaphore.h files.  in fact, there's a fascinating variety of header
files that define that macro identically:
$ grep -rl "#define RW_LOCK_BIAS" *
include/asm-frv/semaphore.h
include/asm-arm26/locks.h
include/asm-m68knommu/semaphore.h
include/asm-i386/rwlock.h
include/asm-sh/spinlock_types.h
include/asm-arm/locks.h
include/asm-m32r/spinlock_types.h
include/asm-m68k/semaphore.h
include/asm-h8300/semaphore.h
include/asm-x86_64/rwlock.h
include/asm-cris/arch-v32/spinlock.h
include/asm-cris/semaphore.h
  so, where is the proper place for that macro definition?
semaphore.h?  locks.h?  rwlock.h?  spinlock.h?  spinlock-types.h?
the fact that that macro is defined in such differing locations
*can't* be a good thing.
