Well it could be something quite simple, in the module loader it is looping
through all modules to look for a device with the correct USB/PCI ID.
Currently, after the first occurence it loads the module and doesn't continue,
it should perhaps be relatively easy that it checks if the driver returned -ENODEV
and continues looping to search for another driver.
