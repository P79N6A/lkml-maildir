  Right, you'd need to remount read-only all the mountpoints of one
filesystem. But if we had read-only bind-mounts, you could do such things
from userspace. It won't be 100% reliable (as it would be racy) but as a
basic protection against stupidity of admin it should work. And it would
be 100% safe against malicious intentions of average user (who has no
right to create new mountpoints).
