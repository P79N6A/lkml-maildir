Well, as far as Suspend can see, all the data has been written. By the
time we reach this point, the end_buffer_io_async routine has been
called for every write submitted, and the last write submitted by
anything else was at least a few seconds ago (all other processes are
frozen and drivers suspended), so all data _should_ be on disk already
and sync should do nothing. Actually, we wouldn't want to call sync
anyway for reasons I won't go into here (unnecessary complication). I'm
sure you'd agree that we would want to delay for an arbitrary length of
time either (no guarantees that that would cut the mustard). We need to
flush caches properly.
Regards,
Nigel
