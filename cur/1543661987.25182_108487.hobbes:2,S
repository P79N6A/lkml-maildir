Most disks seem to have a large cache, but with the cache unit
for most of the cache being one _track_ at a time.
This has the effect of the disk reading one track in at a time,
but only being able to cache a few of these tracks in its cache.
Anticipatory scheduling should reduce any thrashing of this disk
cache.

Rik
