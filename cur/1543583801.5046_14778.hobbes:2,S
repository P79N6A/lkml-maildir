POSIX disagrees with you (accd to the manual page)
$ man isspace
       ....
       isspace()
              checks for white-space characters.  In the "C"  and
              "POSIX"   locales,   these  are:  space,  form-feed
              ('\f'), newline  ('\n'),  carriage  return  ('\r'),
              horizontal tab ('\t'), and vertical tab ('\v').
