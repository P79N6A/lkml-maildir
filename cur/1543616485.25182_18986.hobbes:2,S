The compiler is not free to do only one load there if v is declared
volatile.
The relevant part of the C standard would be the following paragraph:
[6.7.3]
       [#6] An object  that  has  volatile-qualified  type  may  be
       modified in ways unknown to the implementation or have other
       unknown side effects.  Therefore any expression referring to
       such  an object shall be evaluated strictly according to the
       rules of the abstract  machine,  as  described  in  5.1.2.3.
       Furthermore,  at  every sequence point the value last stored
       in the object  shall  agree  with  that  prescribed  by  the
       abstract  machine, except as modified by the unknown factors
       mentioned previously.105)  What constitutes an access to  an
       object  that  has volatile-qualified type is implementation-
       defined.
footnote 105:
       105A volatile declaration may be used to describe an  object
          corresponding  to a memory-mapped input/output port or an
          object  accessed  by   an   asynchronously   interrupting
          function.   Actions  on  objects so declared shall not be
          `optimized  out''  by  an  implementation  or  reordered
          except   as   permitted   by  the  rules  for  evaluating
          expressions.
[Quotes taken from a draft of the final standard, so it is possible,
but unlikely, that this was changed for the final standard.]
