Err, later...
After aborting badblocks on the first disks xfs partition (ctrl-c) and then
running "mkfs.ext2 -v -T largefile4 -O dir_index,sparse_super -m 0" i got a 
"Kernel panic - not syncing: Attempting to free lock on active lock list"
via serial. Still on 2.6.10-rc1-bk23-watermark. I will provide you with a
screenshot monday morning if there is any.
I just updated the debian/unstable i386 installation so it should be debian
version 1.35-8 of the e2fsprogs package.
*sigh*,
