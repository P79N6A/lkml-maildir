My problem with the old mmapped ringbuffer was that it permitted each user
to pin (typically) 48MB of unswappable memory.  Plus this pinned-memory
problem would put upper bounds on the ring size.

What Evgeniy means here is that copy_to_user() is slower than memcpy() (on
his machine, with his kernel config, at least).
Which is kinda weird and unexpected and is something which we should
investigate independently from this project.  (Rather than simply going
and bypassing it!)
