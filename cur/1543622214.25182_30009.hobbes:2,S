Yes. "make oldconfig" will only ask for options not contained in the old
 .config, and options it doesn't ask for don't take any input ;-)

You can extract it. One possibility is to disable compression for
/proc/config and apply your "strings" magic.
The other way works if the config is GZIP compressed. Find the GZIP
magic in the vmlinuz, decompress the compressed part of the image (up
here it is like your "strings" variant), then search for GZIP magic
again and decompress.
Quick&dirty script for the latter (using your "binoffset" tool):
---------- snip ----------
#!/bin/sh
set -e
tmp=/tmp/$$
gziphdr=`binoffset $1 0x1f 0x8b 0x08 2>/dev/null`
dd if=$1 bs=1 skip=$gziphdr 2>/dev/null | gunzip > $tmp
gziphdr=`binoffset $tmp 0x1f 0x8b 0x08 2>/dev/null`
dd if=$tmp bs=1 skip=$gziphdr 2>/dev/null | gunzip
rm -f $tmp
---------- snip ----------
At the moment I'm just writing a tool which does all parts in one turn
(using zlib), to make it faster and more robust (the script above may
fail for example if the kernel image has more than one block of gzip
compressed data embedded). (It's actually working already, but the
code needs some heavy cleanup before it can be released to the public
;-) Come back in a few days for news...
