Right now, Windows XP. I'm pretty sure Linux (well, Debian Etch) works fine. I 
could only get Windows to install with -no-acpi, but I run it with the 
following (if this is at all useful):
kvm -no-acpi -m 256 -hda $IMAGE -net nic -net tap,script=/etc/kvm/kvm-ifup
Basically, the installer seems to work fine, but Windows seemed to have 
problems after installing post-SP2 updates. Maybe that's why not everybody is 
seeing it yet.
