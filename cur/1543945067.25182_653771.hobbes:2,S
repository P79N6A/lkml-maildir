The samples code are supposed to be what the name says 'samples'.
This is not code that are supposed to be part of the built-in kernel.
This is not modules that are supposed to be installes when 
installing modules.
Adding it to core-y as Roland does in the patch below is plain
wrong as it enabled both points above.
The fact that the present code in samples/ does not do this is
in this respect irellevant.
Do we have problems when to build the sampls - then lets
address this issue but not by trying to upgrade the samples
to first class citizen in the kernel - they are not that
and should not be handled like that.
