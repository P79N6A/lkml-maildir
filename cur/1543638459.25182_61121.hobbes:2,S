Yeah. Still not exactly clean. Another suggestion I got was
+     objs="$(sort $(local-objs-y))"; for o in $$objs; do \
from Alex Riesen. This one looks the nicest to me.

I think these should really not be necessary (didn't try, though). I would 
really hope that the body won't get executed when the file is empty, and 
I'd rather have it error out when one of the listed files magically 
disappeared instead of silently skipping some initcalls ;)

Looks good to me...

I guess you meant to remove that part before making the patch ;)
