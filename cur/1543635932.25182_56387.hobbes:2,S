Subject: [PATCH] preemptive kernel for 2.4.19-rc1-ac3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/7/14/153

A preempt-kernel patch for 2.4.19-rc1-ac3 is available at:
	
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/rml/preempt-kernel/v2.4/preempt-kernel-rml-2.4.19-rc1-ac3-1.patch
and mirrors.
The recent scheduler bits introduced plenty of changes to cause the
patch to fail to apply.
This new preempt-kernel patch also includes some of the
scheduler-related preemption optimizations found in 2.5.
