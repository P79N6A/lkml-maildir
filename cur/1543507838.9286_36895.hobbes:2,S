Hi,
 DIPC 2.0-pre10 (
http://wallybox.cei.net/dipc
) is now available for
downloading from orion.cs.uregina.ca/pub/dipc. There are no known bugs
in it, and unless some new problems are detected, this will be the base for
the final DIPC 2.0 release.
 As of 2.0-pre5, DIPC is GPL. Please test 2.0-pre10 and inform me of the
results.
