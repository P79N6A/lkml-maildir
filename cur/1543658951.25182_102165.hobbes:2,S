  [PATCH] 2.5.52-lsm-{dummy,ipc}.patch
  
  This patch adds the remaining System V IPC hooks, including the inline
  documentation for them in security.h.  This includes a restored
  sem_semop hook, as it does seem to be necessary to support fine-grained
  access.
  
  All of these System V IPC hooks are used by SELinux.  The SELinux System
  V IPC access controls were originally described in the technical report
  available from 
http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/slinux-abs.html,
 and the
  LSM-based implementation is described in the technical report available
  from 
http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/module-abs.html.
