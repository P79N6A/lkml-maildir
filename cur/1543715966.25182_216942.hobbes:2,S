It is the physical address of a frame buffer, this code is allowing
user programs to point the video capturing to go directly onto a
frame buffer at a specific location.
Using dma_addr_t here is a poor choice, since that data type is to
be used to PCI DMA API interfaces for doing transfers to/from real
memory, not frame buffers and the like :-)
Unfortunately, there is no portable interface available for what
this code wants to do, which is device<-->device DMA transfers.
We would need to create an interface that took two device structures,
and some base+offset values, in order to provide a portable way to
do this, then a reworked version of this user interface would be needed
as well.
In short, it's long term to fix this up, don't worry about it for
now.
