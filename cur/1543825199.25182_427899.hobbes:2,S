Hi Russell!
Not sure when you'll be back from your trip, but I'll leave this hanging
in your inbox until then. :)
I've been getting several complaints about the issue with sector sizes
and large MMC/SD cards. I seem to recall we discussed this earlier, but
I cannot find those mail and I don't remember our conclusions.
I do, however, have the following in both the SD and MMC card specs I
have (both sandisk though):
WRITE_BL_PARTIAL — defines whether partial block sizes can be used
                   in block write commands.
Table 3-25
  WRITE_BL_PARTIAL                                  Definition
            0       Only the WRITE_BL_LEN block size, and its partial
                    derivatives in
                    resolution of units of 512 blocks, can be used for
                    block oriented data
                    write.
            1       Smaller blocks can be used as well. The minimum
                    block size is one
                    byte.
So perhaps we should remove all the funky logic that's in mmc_block.c
right now and just always select a block size of 512 bytes? People have
been reporting that their Palms, cameras and USB readers will not accept
anything else.
Rgds
