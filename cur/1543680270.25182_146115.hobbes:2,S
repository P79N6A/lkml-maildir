Cool, that means we just need to hash out the framework for optimized
implementations now..

Should also depend on CONFIG_X86 && !CONFIG_X86_64

That's not how kernel makesfile work.  It should be something like
aes-i586-y		:= aes-i586-asm.o aes-i586-glue.o

Please use C-style comments.

Should be
	if (key_length != 16 && key_length != 24 && key_length != 32) {

MODULE_AUTHOR is missing.  Also the description should mention that
this is an optimized assembly version.
