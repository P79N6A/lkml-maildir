As I see it, what we can resonably do with 'noexec' is
- make execve() fail.
- make access(), faccessat() return EACCESS for files stored on
'noexec' filesystems.
- make mmap(...PROT_EXEC...) fail for files stored on 'noexec' filesystems.
For things like /dev/shm we can additionally let 'noexec' mean "don't
allow executable shared memory".
Since we can't really prevent things like perl/php/bash/tcl/whatever
scripts from being executed/interpreted from there with this
mechanism, let's not worry about that.  Leave that for things like
SELinux to deal with.
I don't think we can do much more with 'noexec'.
