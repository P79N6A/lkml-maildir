The alternatives comment was in relation to the readahead based drop
behind patch,for which an alternative would be improving use-once,
possibly in the way I described.
As for swap prefetch, I don't know, I'm not in charge of it being
merged or not merged. I do know some people have reported that their
updatedb problem gets much better with swap prefetch turned on, and
I am trying to work on that too.
For you? You also have the alternative to help improve things yourself,
and you can modify your own kernel.
