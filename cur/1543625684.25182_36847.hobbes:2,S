hi all
When booting up with a Logitech USB keyboard (the one with a with scroll
wheel), the system reboots immediately when probing for an AT keyboard
(after pty: 256 Unix98 ptys configured). When unplugging it, I get this
keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(ed)
keyboard: Timeout - AT keyboard not present?(f4)
any ideas?
it works fine if I re-attach the keyboard after reboot
I'm using kernel 2.4.19-pre3-ac1
PCI controller is an SiS
  Bus  0, device   1, function  2:
    USB Controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 7001 (rev 7).
      IRQ 12.
      Master Capable.  Latency=32.  Max Lat=80.
      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe7800000 [0xe7800fff].
  Bus  0, device   1, function  3:
    USB Controller: Silicon Integrated Systems [SiS] 7001 (#2) (rev 7).

      Non-prefetchable 32 bit memory at 0xe7000000 [0xe7000fff].
thanks
