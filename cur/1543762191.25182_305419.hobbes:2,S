open/free/netbsd survives. I guess OSX does too.
Gentoo (non-hardened), Red Hat, Mandrake, FC2 are vulnerable.
Debian stable survives but they set the default proc limit to 256. Looks
like Suse also is not vulerable. (I wonder if the daemons started from
booscripts are vulnerable though)
Solaris 10 seems to be vulnerable.

I think it would be nice if Linux could be mentioned together with the
*bsd's instead of the commercial *nixes next time :)
