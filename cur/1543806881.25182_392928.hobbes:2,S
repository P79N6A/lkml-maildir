Because it does not get marketting people's attention anymore does not
mean it's dead, the opposite. They've done their work at selling it.
Now it runs at many places. Distro vendors like Red Hat will still
support it for a few years. Mission-critical systems have not moved to
2.6 yet ! Any I'm sure that David could give you amazing examples of
critical systems reliably running on 2.0 with hundreds of days of
uptime !

In fact, I think you have chosen the wrong kernel base to start your
work. If you don't have the skills to follow large updates, you should
choose a stable kernel (stable code-wise). There is nothing ridiculous
in starting a project on 2.0, 2.2 or 2.4 right now. Given the past
experience of 2.4 and the time I can spend on kernel work, I would
not even consider basing anything on 2.6 before something like 2.6.20-25,
when it will hopefully settle down a bit. However, I have some 2.6 kernels
on very specific applications where I know I will not need to upgrade it,
eg: to make a bootloader using kexec, and on my home web server (hppa).

I understand what you feel but again, you did the wrong choice. You've
chosen 2.6 for various reasons, but you cannot expect its developers to
work the way that suits you best. Observe how kernels evolve and choose
another base to get less work. 2.4 can cost less than a few hours a month.
2.0 would need less than a few hours in a several years. Isn't it worth
spending more time porting your application to those kernels than you
currently spend trying to stay up to date with 2.6 ?
