Documentation/fsync.txt would be better.
I mean, suppose I write to some MTA's authors to inform them that
their product is "broken on Linux" and telling them how to fix it.
They might think I am nuts, or that this behavior is an implementation
coincidence.  (Some of them even seem to think Linux is not complying
with the relevant standards.  That there is even an argument here
means that the standards themselves are broken; standards are supposed
to be very clear.)
To where should I refer these authors to convince them that this
really is how Linux behaves, by definition, now and forever?  Should I
point them at the flamewars in various mailing list archives?  Should
I suggest they write to Linus personally?
I would rather refer them to Documentation/fsync.txt.  Do you agree?
Would you accept a patch to add it?
