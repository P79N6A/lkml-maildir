I've tested the latest kernels -bitten by truncate too- and have found
that the ECN configuration does not work as expected.
If you just unset it in .config and echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn,
it just acts as if it was enabled.
If you include it in your .config and then echo 0 >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
it really disables it.
So I guess that there is something wrong when in theory it is disabled.
