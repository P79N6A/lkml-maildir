I concur with Matt Schulkind.  This is usually symptom of and old
Highpoint bios or even KT7A bios version.
If you believe it to be some sort of a driver problem i urge you to query
the atariad mailing list.
Until then... for your mothe board i would point you to the KT7 FAQ.

Though it is a bit windows centric, it describes in great detail many of
the issues with the board.  (it seems like there are many, but at least
they are known and documented, unlike many other MBs out there.)
