Interesting...
I actually use dual Opterons systems, with very large route cache hashes 
and tcp hashes. (rhash_entries=524288 thash_entries=524288), and a 
Hugetlb aware user space programs.
x86info tells me (maybe wrongly)
Family: 15 Model: 5 Stepping: 8
CPU Model : Opteron
Instruction TLB: Fully associative. 32 entries.
Data TLB: Fully associative. 32 entries.
and /proc/cpuinfo tells me :
model name      : AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 248
TLB size        : 1088 4K pages
My questions are :
1) Are the route cache and tcp hashes use big pages (2MB) on 2.6.5/2.6.9 
x86_64 kernels.
2) What are the exact number of data TLB entries (for small pages and 
huge ones) for opterons ?
3) All networks interrupts are handled by CPU0. Should we really use 
NUMA interleaved memory for hashes in this case ?
Thank you
