Subject: [PATCH 03/19] raid5: move check parity operations to a workqueue
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/11/323

From: Dan Williams <dan.j.williams@intel.com>
Enable handle_stripe5 to pass off check parity operations to
raid5_do_soft_block_ops formerly handled by compute_parity5.
Changelog:
* removed handle_check_operations5.  All logic moved into handle_stripe5 so
that we do not need to go through the initiation logic to end the
operation.
* clear the uptodate bit on the parity block
* hold off check operations if a parity dependent operation is in flight
like a write
