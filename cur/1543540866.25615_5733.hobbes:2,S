   You're right.  But no-one actually cares about whether a lock is held -
   they care about whether they're holding it or someone else is holding it
   or no-one's holding it.
while (spin_is_locked(&lock)) {
	/* Wait for others to release their references. */
	barrier();
}
This type of code does happen, what is the correct return value so
that spin_is_locked() handles this kind of case?
