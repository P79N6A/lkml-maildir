Steve Lord, please work with Yura to resolve the bug that mongo triggers in
XFS.  I assume you will be as eager as we usually are for any script that can
reproduce a bug.
Yura's benchmarks don't really show off the strengths of XFS, just as the
spanish benchmark didn't show off the strengths of reiserfs.  I expect that once
mongo works there will be areas where XFS has clear advantages, probably in
large file IO and for reads.  We look forward to measuring reiser4 against XFS
during linux 2.6, though I suspect there will always be (changing) areas where
the two filesystems each offer the users different advantages.
