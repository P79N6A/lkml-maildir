That depends if the printk() changes the timing such that it doesn't occur.
Don't know, I'm only grasping at straws due to the lack of any concrete
information.

The reported dump shows that the kernel tried to access virtual address 0,
and the instruction pointer seems to be the cause of that - it has a value
of zero in that dump.
The call trace indicates that the last function was called from around
"uart_startup+0x63/0xf4" which is probably the indirect function call
to serial8250_startup().  That's unconfirmed - the only way to get it
confirmed is if you could dump the entire uart_startup() function.
$ grep uart_startup System.map
(address) T uart_startup
$ objdump -r -d vmlinux --start-addr=0x<address> --stop-addr=0x<address+256>
The grep should get you the address of uart_startup.  Replace <address>
with that value and <address+256> with the value plus 256 (0x100) and
mail the result.

We're both at the same level of clue about the problem then.
