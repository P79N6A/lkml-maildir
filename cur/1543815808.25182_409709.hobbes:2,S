Subject: [PATCH  0/12] PNP: adjust pnp_register_card_driver() signature
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Remove the assumption that pnp_register_card_driver() returns the
number of devices claimed.  I recently changed the interface along
with pnp_register_driver(), but forgot to update the callers of
pnp_register_card_driver().
Several of these patches also fix unrelated __init/__devinit issues
found by "make buildcheck".  Most of these are for .probe() methods,
so they shouldn't have caused any problems because I doubt there are
any hot-pluggable PNP sound cards.
