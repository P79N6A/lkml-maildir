One reasonably obvious strategy would be along the lines of the
following pseudocode:
 1. Determine integrity of primary superblock. If OK, go to
    step 9.
 2. Set BLKSZ to 1k.
 3. Determine if location of second superblock on filesystem
    with blocksize BLKSZ actually contains a superblock. If
    so, go to step 8.
 4. Set BLKSZ to 2 * BLKSZ.
 5. If BLKSZ is not greater than maximum valid blocksize, go
    to step 3.
 6. No valid second superblock found, so report error and exit.
 7. Determine integrity of current superblock. If OK, go to
    step 9.
 8. Determine location of next superblock for this filesystem
    blocksize. If there is one, go to step 7, else go to step
    6.
 9. Found valid superblock, so use it and exit.
One other point: Presumably if it needs to resort to a superblock
other than the primary one, e2fsck will copy the valid superblock
over the ones that were compromised?
Best wishes from Riley.

    includes separate sublists both for each kernel series, and for
    each year of development.
