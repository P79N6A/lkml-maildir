Sigh...  it's such a cool idea, and yet such a dangerously easy thing to
get wrong, ie dropping the ability for a root process to drop it's root
privs.
If we were to drop posix caps, how would selinux change correspondingly?
Would it just drop the capability class altogether, perhaps beef up the
task or security class?  Just wondering whether anyone had thought about
this.
Alternatively, we could try yet again to get support for fs caps
upstream...
