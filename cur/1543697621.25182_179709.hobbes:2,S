Well, sort of.
You can't have a setuid shell script using #!/bin/bash because
/bin/bash doesn't support it.
You *can* have a setuid Perl script using #!/usr/bin/perl because Perl
knows how to run setuid safely.
It's up to the script interpreter (if it is setuid or has an setuid
wrapper available -- Perl does it the latter way) to decide to honour
the setuid bit on a script.
If you really want to use a setuid script, you can create
a setuid /usr/bin/setuidbash which would do whatever sanitization you
felt was appropriate, and then exec bash with the appropriate
permissions.  Then put #!/usr/bin/setuidbash in your scripts.
