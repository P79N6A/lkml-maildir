Sorry. No we do not need this fix. The patch is fine as is.
In slab_alloc() the slow path is entered if c->lockless is NULL. So it
does not matter for slow path determination that node_match always returns 
1 in the !NUMA case.
c->node only needs to be checked for slow path determination in 
slab_free(). And there the node_match is not called.
