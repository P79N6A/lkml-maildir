	Great!  2.3.x is almost to the point where it
has all the features I need to use it.  :)  One important
question:
	Is the I/O protocol for 0.8final the same as 0.8i?  
If not, is there a 0.8final for 2.2.x?  Basically, I don't
want to install the 0.8final userspace tools and find
that I can't use 2.2.x anymore.
	And on a completely unrelated note, anyone know
if RAID5 is working in 2.3.x yet?  It blows up everytime
I try it.
