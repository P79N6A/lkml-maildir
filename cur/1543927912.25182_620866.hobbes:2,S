Probing intermittent failures in Domain Validation, even with the fixes
applied leads me to the conclusion that there are further problems with
this commit:

    [SCSI] Do not requeue requests if REQ_FAILFAST is set
The essence of the problems is that you're causing REQ_FAILFAST to
terminate commands with error on requeuing conditions, some of which are
relatively common on most SCSI devices.  While this may be the correct
behaviour for multi-path, it's certainly wrong for the previously
understood meaning of REQ_FAILFAST, which was don't retry on error,
which is why domain validation and other applications use it to control
error handling, but don't expect to get failures for a simple requeue
are now spitting errors.
I honestly can't see that, even for the multi-path case, returning an
error when we're over queue depth is the correct thing to do (it may not
matter to something like a symmetrix, but an array that has a non-zero
cost associated with a path change, like a CPQ HSV or the AVT
controllers, will show fairly large slow downs if you do this).  Even if
this is the desired behaviour (and I think that's a policy issue),
DID_NO_CONNECT is almost certainly the wrong error to be sending back.
This patch fixes up domain validation to work again correctly, however,
I really think it's just a bandaid.  Do you want to rethink the above
commit?
