Given the fact that there isn't in general any way for the kernel to know what
was intended, I don't see how any kernel policy other than "NUL and / are
special, but if you use anything other than UTF-8 it will eventually come back
to haunt you" can possibly be made to work.
For that matter, I have seen actual production code that intentionally created
fairly deep directory trees and terminal file names that were basically hashes
written in radix-254 and blatted out in binary.  Lots of them.  The original
problem report I got was along the lines of "We installed XYZ, and the file
system appears corrupted - ls -R weird the screen out, and 'find | wc -l' is
127,000 different than what 'df -i' reports".
I was ready to strangle the guilty party - radix-64 wouldn't have been a big
efficiency hit and at least the uuencode/base-64 charset doesn't weird your
terminal out. :)
So it's not even always possible to make the assumption that the filename is
supposed to make sense in *any* charset. This one requires fixing in some
combination of userspace and meatspace....
