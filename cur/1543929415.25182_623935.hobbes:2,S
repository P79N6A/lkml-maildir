as far as I understand, there are the following place removing inode
from i_sb_list:
- generic_delete_inode (via iput_final)
- generic_forget_inode (via iput_final)
- hugetlbfs_forget_inode
- dispose_list after the check under inode_lock for i_count
So, the patch is sane from disappearing point of view:
- I hold inode under inode_lock
- and iput it after new inode to clean has been found and hold
Nevertheless we'll think a bit about ext3 fix. Though other staff like
gfs2 etc can also be affected.
