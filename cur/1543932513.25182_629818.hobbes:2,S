Done. Also I think it's better not to split the `found' case into
the two cases of 'found & lock-ok' and 'found & wait-lock' for now.
That would reduce some more code:
-/*
- * A successful mmap hit is when we didn't need any IO at all,
- * and got an immediate lock on an up-to-date page. There's not
- * much to do, except decide on whether we want to trigger read-
- * ahead.
- *
- * We currently do the same thing as we did for a locked page
- * that we're waiting for.
