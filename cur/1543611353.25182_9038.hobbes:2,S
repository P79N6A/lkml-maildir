Hello everyone,
I'm searching for something on Rpm based distributions.
I'm usually using debian and whenever I recompile my kernel I use the
make-kpkg buildpackage in the /usr/src/linux directory to have a nice
debian pacakge with creates the lilo image (I'm using grub but whatever
:) ).
Is there such a tool for redhat based distribution or at least only for
the suse (7.2 or 7.3) ?
Thanks for any help.
        Sam
