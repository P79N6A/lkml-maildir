Sounds like an uncommonly bad idea to me, since the range 19-22 is already 
used at least by PPC.
Yeah, 18 itself may be free (although I wonder _why_? Maybe it's some old 
value that is no longer used by the kernel but old binaries may know 
about?) but the fact is that there just isn't room in the low numbers, 
which was why I put it up higher.
