This sort of thing is nice to hear, but, it does show up a problem in
the non-preempt kernel.  That preemption improves compile performance
implies that the kernel is not doing the right thing during a normal
compile and that preemption, to some extent, corrects the problem.  But
preemption adds the overhead of additional context switches.  It would
be nice to know where the time is coming from.  I.e. lets assume that
the actual compile takes about the same amount of execution time with or
without preemption.  Then for the preemptable kernel to do the job
faster something else must go up, idle time perhaps.  If this is the
case, then there is some place in the kernel that is wasting cpu time
and that is preemptable and the preemptable patch is moving this idle
time to the idle process.  
What ever the reason, while I do want to promote preemption, I think we
should look at this issue and, at the very least, explain it.
