	If they are really needed, why aren't they put into the main
	tree (or at least the -ac series). Since I am running mainly
	-ac kernels (for NFS in fact), I have not been able to
	apply any of the HJL patches that come with the knfsd-1.4.x
	packages : some of his patches conflict with -ac patches.
	So, I gave up applying the patches, and am wondering what
	hidden crashes I may encounter because of that.
