I think the +2 is right.
For read/readdir the reply can be slightly larger than the "payload",
(headers, etc) so we need one payload, plus one for the rest of the
reply, plus one to hold the request.
For write, the request can be large than the payload, so again we need
payload + 1 (for request) + 1 (for reply).
Something like the following.
