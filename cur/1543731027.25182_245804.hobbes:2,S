Is there any technical reason that we couldn't set a flag in the struct 
file* and put code in the read/write calls to handle shrinking the page 
cache? This is similar to what was done with O_STREAMING in 2.4. It 
seems like it would conform more to the behavior expected from 
POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE, and I wouldn't have to make a bunch of system calls :-)
