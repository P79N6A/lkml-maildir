thanks, this one builds fine and boots fine on a dual-core X2 box, in 
full PREEMPT_RT mode. I cannot see anything obviously wrong going on, so 
i've released this as -rt4.
could you send the doc fixups against -rt4? Please also add back the 
credits to plist.h (and add your own name for these improvements).  
Thanks,
	Ingo
