I took few shortcuts in the patch compared to original DIO code. 
eg., I create a bio all the time.. original code reuses them.
But I don't think that is causing the performance hit. Anyway,
here is the vmstat and profile=2 output.

My Bad :)
aio_read/aio_write() routines take loff_t not loff_t * (like regular read/writes)
        ssize_t (*read) (struct file *, char *, size_t, loff_t *);
        ssize_t (*aio_read) (struct kiocb *, char *, size_t, loff_t);
I coded for loff_t *. fixed it.  I am testing it now.
Thanks,
Badari
