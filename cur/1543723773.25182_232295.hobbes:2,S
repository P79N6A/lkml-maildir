Hi!
I have had to revert usb-locking-fix.patch and bk-usb.patch from 2.6.7-
mm6 as they are preventing my laptop for either suspending to RAM or
hibernating to disk (via swsusp).
Doing "echo -n mem > /sys/power/state" fails with:
PM: Preparing system for suspend
Stopping tasks: ==============
 stopping tasks failed (1 tasks remaining)
Restarting tasks...<6> Strange, khubd not stopped
 done
The same happens when trying "echo 4 > /proc/acpi/sleep".
Reverting both patches fixes the problem.
Thanks!
