With debug level to 0x3f (decimal 63) and debugging code enabled,
the resulting boot messages are captured here:
  
ftp://ftp.madduck.net/scratch/dmesg-aic7xxx-debug.gz
 [3.5 Kb]
Another peculiarity: if I soft reset the machine from within 2.6.0
and then start 2.6.0 again, it gets stuck again after the
  found reiserfs format "3.6" with standard journal
message, this time logging furiously to the console. I will verify
this again and let it run forever (with maximum kernel buffer size)
in the hope that you can do something with that too. You'll hear
from me.
Thanks for your time.
