i wasn't about to run off and start changing stuff, i was just curious
about the general philosophy.  i *might* see the value of a patch if
it's a cleanup that affects a restricted set of files that are
logically related and can be done with a single patch.  beyond that,
no.
the only reason the above example caught my eye is the insistence in
the comments as to why those includes were there, when there were no
invocations of those routines anywhere in the file.  i always find
that curious.
