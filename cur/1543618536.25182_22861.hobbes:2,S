I found some additional info for you.
Our famous German c't magazin have:
http://www.heise.de/ct/01/18/036/default.shtml
And you should have a look into this AMD doku (sadly _NO_ AMD 750/760 infos):
"AMD Athlon Processor Model 4 Revision Guide"
www.amd.com/products/cpg/athlon/techdocs/pdf/23614.pdf
