I don't think I made significant legal arguments.  My points were
about the spirit of the license.  That's not legal at all.  That's
moral and ethical background.
Your aggressive response directed at the FSF came as quite a surprise
to me, given the way I got into this conversation.

I respectfully disagree, and I know I'm not alone in this assessment.
I know other kernel developers agree with it.  And they're as entitled
to claim failure to comply with the license as you are.

You countered one of the various arguments I have, and you failed at
that.  It was another, quite different argument, that got me to
realize it didn't work legally.  But this says nothing about
compliance with the spirit of the license.

I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one.

No, TiVO could just throw the key away.  Why doesn't it?

I don't think I've ever claimed you were confused about (a).  I said
we disagreed.  That's quite different.
You were confused between the legalese and the spirit.

Aah, now we're getting somewhere!

If you and all other Linux copyright holders agreed about it, sure.
Just like you could all grant it an additional permission, just so
that they feel safe about it.

Yes.  They'd have to give up the ability to update the software, or
pass it on to the user.  If they can't do the latter, they could still
do the former.  How bad would this be for them, do you know?

That's because when you talk about why GPLv2 is better, you always
talked about virtues that are just as present in v3, and that AFAICT
would in fact by increased by v3.

I'm sorry if I come off that way.  But we really look at this issue
from very different perspectives, and it's difficult for me to try to
see it your way.  Please cut me some slack here.  I'm trying hard, but
there is so much noise and so many hard feelings that seeing what the
real issues are is not that easy.
Thanks for your understanding,
