Keeping the stack and task struct together is smarter. You fix the one
problem but not the other horror.
When you are bored one day run apache with 120 servers on a typical real
world load. Keep snapshotting the kernel %esp and look at the cache
colouring.  
We need to perturb esp colour too. It might be the right way to do this
is slab based kernel stacks, it might be that your code is cheaper than
the cost of getting current the really hard way and we should just add
random numbers to the initial esp of a task ?
