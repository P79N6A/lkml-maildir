That's weird, I never had a suspend problem due to a fuse mount,
though I have them all the time.  And I suspect, that even the sync()
thing that suspend does is not the real cause, because sync() actually
does nothing in fuse filesystems.
So there's something else going on, which obviously has to do with
freezing user processes, but it's not clear what.
