Actually, just to be clear - the number isn't completely
meaningless, it's the actual size on disk (from the st_blocks
if they're available, filesize if not) rounded up to the nearest
1mb boundary. Just didn't want you to think we were randomly
returning 1mb. It's a meaningful number, it's just the granularity
that's a bit off :-).
