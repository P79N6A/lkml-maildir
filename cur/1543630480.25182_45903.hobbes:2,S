Well anyway. What we have right now, looking for the channel perspective,
is indeed some nIEN tricks done here and there. However the problem is
that we postpone the disabling of interface interrupts now until the
time a next request gets queued. In addition the driver is doing quite
a lot of polling for the next expected interrutp as well.
Right now the consequences are indeed very simple for me. The time I
started to sanitize the data structures I first had to paint down
diagram of pointers between them. Now it's simple time to write down
a state diagram for the IRQ / request handling code paths :-).
