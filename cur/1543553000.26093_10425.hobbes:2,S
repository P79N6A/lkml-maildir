I think the biggest advantage is that you actually get the list of pages
when you perform the mmap instead of doing virt_to_page on every ->nopage.
That should speed up the operations on the mmap'ed are a bit.
The other strong argument for the kiobuf solution is code-sharing. Instead
of having every (sound) driver playing with the vm, there is one central
place when you use kvmaps.
