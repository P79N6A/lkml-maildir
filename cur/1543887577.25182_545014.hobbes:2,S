Alan,
We have i2o on one of our testnodes: Adaptec Zero channel RAID 2010S integrated
on MSI MS-9136 motherboard and I don't have access to another i2o hardware.
Also I don't have any ideas how to detect buggy i2o node. As far as I understand
Markus is right, and i2o hardware couldn't handle received message that on the
first glance looks correctly.
From my POV it is bug in firmware and only vendor is able to fix it correctly.
My patch is not a fix but workaround only -- it just do not allow to crash the
node by any user in case when node admin due some reasons has loaded i2o_proc
module.
Thank you,
	Vasily Averin
