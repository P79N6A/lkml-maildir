  Perhaps it would be a good idea if kernel boot messages said something
like:
"IDE problems? Enable CONFIG_IDE, etc in configuration."
"SHM problems? mkdir /var/shm; add 'shm var/shm shm' to /etc/fstab"
I had the SHM problem, as did a lot of people, and almost posted here
until I figured it out. Something like this in dmesg would have gotten my
attention right away. Save people time, keep down list volume.
  Just a thought, anyway.
