Hi;
With current Linus's git tree + current kexec-tools-testing [1] (also with 
kexec-tools-1.101) tree "kexec -e" call on reboot failed with following;
kexec failed: invalid argument
kexec document says its users responsibility to close running softwares, 
mounting disks in read only mode etc. and it suggest calling "kexec -e" just 
before the "reboot" call and talks about future merge with sysvinit's reboot 
and kexec, and when i did it, it will not starts new kernel and instead gaves 
that error.
But more supringuisly if i try to execute "kexec -e" directly (in init3 with 
rw disks and lots of running software) it will starts new kernel without a 
problem. 
For reference im using following kexec line for loading the kernel
kexec -l /boot/kernel-2.6.22-rc4-CFS-v16 --append="root=/dev/sda3" --initrd=/boot/initramfs-2.6.22-rc4-CFS-v16
I'm not sure this is a regression or my(maybe me or kexec document misses some 
point) mistake cause this is my first attempt to use kexec, but i want to 
report the situation :)
