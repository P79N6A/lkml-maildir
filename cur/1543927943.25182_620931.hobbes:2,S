Actually, a fully-secured strict-mode SELinux system will have no  
unconfined_t processes; none of my test systems have any.  Generally  
"unconfined_t" is used for situations similar to what AppArmor was  
designed for, where the only "interesting" security is that of the  
daemon (which is properly labelled) and one or more of the users are  
unconfined.
Even then "unconfined_t" is not an implicit part of the policy, it is  
explicitly given the ability to take any action on any object by  
rules in the policy, and it typically still falls under a few MLS  
labeling restrictions even in the targeted policy.
