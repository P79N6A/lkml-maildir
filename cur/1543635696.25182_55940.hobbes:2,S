Erm, that looks like the old "out of inodes, return -ENOSPC and mark the
filesystem read only" bug I found several months ago.  iirc, there have
been 3 recent issues (in the last three months) that I'm aware of:
1. running out of free blocks.
2. running out of free inodes.
3. i_nlink accounting goofup.
I've got patches from akpm for (1) and (3), but not (2).  I'd be nice to
have all three solved for 2.4.19.
