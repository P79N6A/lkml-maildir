Last year I started programming on a utility that requires a unique boot id
to avoid that multiple instances running put multiple entries in a datafile
for one boot/uptime session.
At first I looked at the btime entry from /proc/stat but later discovered
it's unreliable. It's not a static boottime, but currentdate-uptime, which
thus might change after using clock, netdate, date -s, etc.

Does the kernel create any entry that is unique to the current boot session?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
At the moment I use a work-around by creating an ID in rc.S and then using
it when starting the program in rc.local, but I would prefer to use an ID
provided by the kernel.
Regards, Rob
