Please update the patch against the current libata-dev#upstream and
there are several lines where tab follows space and git-applymbox isn't
happy about it.  Those lines are in other patches too.

This function is directly called from SCSI sysfs write, right?  You
can't do this without synchronizing with EH.  The best way is to define
an EH action and ask EH to transit between powersave states.

Is it safe to use ALPM on a device which only claims to support DIPM?

I think this should be ATA_HORKAGE_IPM.

Again, this should be done from EH.

We probably need !0xffff test here.
