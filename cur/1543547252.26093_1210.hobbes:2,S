Yes, I was commenting on Andi's proposal. I think it's very important to
avoid the need for boot loader modifications - there are simply too many
of them nowadays.

Oh, I agree. What may be quite hard is finding the file. Already with
LOADLIN, it may get hairy, and who knows what the future will bring ?
Also, if you overwrite (update) your kernel image and/or edit your
/etc/lilo.conf, you'll get the wrong answer, unless you add some magic
number (MD5 hash or such) that can be queried for the running kernel.
But then you're probably already beyond the point of having a
fully-featured /proc/config.gz, complexity-wise (which, after all,
would be completely architecture-independent).
