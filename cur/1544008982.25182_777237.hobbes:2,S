I also think it should show up as /dev/sda1 but it doesn't. (there is no /dev/sda1 device)
When i use the same setup (udev-135 etc.) and only downgrades the kernel to 2.6.24.5
 then it shows up as an mountable device and works as it should.
This made me guess that it has something to do with the 2.6.27.7 kernel.
But i'm only guessing.
