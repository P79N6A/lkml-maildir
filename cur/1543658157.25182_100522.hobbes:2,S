Sorry, I forgot to include a bit better description of what the
row labels mean.  
sched50 = linux 2.5.50 with the NUMA scheduler
sched52 = linux 2.5.52 with the NUMA scheduler
sched53 = linux 2.5.53 with the NUMA scheduler
stock50 = linux 2.5.50 without the NUMA scheduler
stock53 = linux 2.5.53 without the NUMA scheduler
Thus, this shows that the NUMA scheduler drops systime by ~5.5 secs,
or roughly 8%.  So, my testing is not showing an increase in systime
like you apparently are seeing.
