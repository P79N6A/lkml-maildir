Speaking of the above point, everyone go check their MAKEDEV man-page
before continuing this pointless argument.
Especially the part about 'MAKEDEV update' and how it automatically figures
out what is configured and what has been removed.  Now just make it a tad
smarter (it didn't know about the bttv driver, for example) and you have a
quite reasonable device creator.

(RedHat 6.0 MAKEDEV man page has it, before someone with a different
version flames me for being wrong.)
