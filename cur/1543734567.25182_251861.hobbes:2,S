The disassembly is:
		mov    0xc04fef10,%edx			edx is "mem_map"
		lea    0x40000000(%ecx),%eax		ecx is virtual address of "obj"
		shr    $0xc,%eax			eax is now pfn
		shl    $0x5,%eax			pfn * sizeof(struct page)
		mov    0x1c(%edx,%eax,1),%ebx		page->lru.prev
****		mov    0x4(%ebx),%edx			*****
		mov    (%ebx),%eax
		mov    %edx,0x4(%eax)
		mov    %eax,(%edx)
and your "%ebx" value is obviously crap. In fact, it looks like your %ecx 
is crap to begin with.
Looks like this code (mm/slab.c: 2131):
                slabp = GET_PAGE_SLAB(virt_to_page(objp));
		list_del(&slabp->list);
and in particular, you have "slabp" in %ebx, and the thing that oopses is 
trying to load "entry->prev" in list_del(). 
Looking at the register state:
	eax: 0080cc00   ebx: 013bab03   ecx: 00660044   edx: c1000000
	esi: c178f7e0   edi: 00000000   ebp: eff09f04   esp: eff09ee8
That "ecx" value looks strange. It should be a kernel virtual address, and 
it isn't.
Looks like somebody is trying to free an invalid address. Sadly, your 
traceback doesn't show _who_, because it's hidden in the buffering.
The only changes to slab itself have been by Christoph lately, I don't 
think that matters. Can you enable slab debugging? That should catch it 
much earlier..
