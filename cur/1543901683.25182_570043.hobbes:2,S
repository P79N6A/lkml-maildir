Ahh, ok. Is this old, or was it introduced recently (I'm looking at my 
recent change to that area, it doesn't seem to introduce this)?
IOW, how did you even notice this?
Also, while your one-liner looks correct, it does make me wonder: the 
whole
	if ((current->fsuid != inode->i_uid) && !capable(CAP_FOWNER))
test is a rather common test, and in fact, arguably, every time you see 
one part of it, you should probably see the other. Would it make sense to 
make a helper inline function to do this, and replace all users? Doing a
	git grep 'fsuid.*\<i_uid\>'
seems to show quite a few cases of this pattern..
