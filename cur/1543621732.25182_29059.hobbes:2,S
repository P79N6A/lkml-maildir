1. You need permissions to open a file.
2. Opening may cause undesired side effects (think "/dev/st0").
3. You can't open a symlink.

 Due to the limitations quoted above the ioctl is unsuitable as an
underlying way to retrieve "st_gen" for neither of stat(), stat64(),
lstat() or lstat64().

 Fully agreed.  It might be desireable to keep a few spare bytes at the
end of the new "struct stat64" as well (like it's already done for "struct
stat"), so there is no need to add syscalls each time a new member is
added.
