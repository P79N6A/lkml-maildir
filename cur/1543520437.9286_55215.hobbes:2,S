RFC 1122 says:
            Keep-alive packets MUST only be sent when no data or
            acknowledgement packets have been received for the
            connection within an interval.  This interval MUST be
            configurable and MUST default to no less than two hours.
The default is 3 hours, which is reasonable. It appears that the keepalive
timer is only checked every 75 seconds anyway.
And I just noticed that the comment in tcp.h says "two hours" instead of
"three hours".

I think that's related to user timeout (SO_SNDTIMEO and SO_RCVTIMEO?), not
keepalives. Keepalives are for keeping an idle link alive. Your problem is
making a dead link give up.

If you open a TCP connection and don't send/receive anything for 3 hours
then it should send a keep-alive packet. I'm not sure if it does though.
