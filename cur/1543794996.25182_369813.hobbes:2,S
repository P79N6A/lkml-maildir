Yes, the inode shrinker can discard all pagecache from a file if
it is under a lot of pressure to free inodes. This is what you
are seeing I guess.

I don't think that kswapd-incmin puts much more pressure on the slab
(unless there is a bug), but I'll take a look. It could just be a
"weird" interaction in the reclaim code, or possibly a rounding issue.
Changing the pressure calculation here is probably not the right way
to do this, but rather in vmscan.c. I know Andrea has recently been
looking at a problem with slab shrinking too.
Thanks,
Nick
