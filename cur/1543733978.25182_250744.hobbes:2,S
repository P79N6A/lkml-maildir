Something odd is going on, in part because I get *blistering* IO speeds
running benchmarks like dbench, tiobench, et al on tmpfs with striped
swap. In fact, IO speeds markedly faster than any other filesystem I've
ever tried, by about 30MB/s (i.e. wirespeed, where others fall about
37.5% short of it). Virtual alignment issues do hurt, but the core
allocation algorithm appears to be better than good, it's astounding.

Well, yes, dbench on tmpfs isn't really the load we're shooting for.
