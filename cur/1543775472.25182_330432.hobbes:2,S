I don't see why an idle system would align such request in this way any more 
than a busy one.  In both cases the range would be ~0 to 1ms (which is what the 
standard says it should be) with an average of .5ms.  Any other result is caused 
by syncing, in some way with the tick clock.

Still, it is the "correct" thing to do (standard wise, etc...).
It is rather amazing that this has been in the system this long.  Should have 
been fixed long ago...
