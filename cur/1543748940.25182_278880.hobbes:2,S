You don't manage something that does not need managing. It's like firing a 
bullet at some. You can not tell whether there's still more bullets to come or 
not.

See linux-os's reply. UDP is connectionless.

I let it pass.

That's something VERY different. There is a difference between **knowing** 
that a set of packets _are related_ to each other and the time between two 
**arbitrary** packets.

Depends on the definition of attack. Look it at that way:
localhost:32768 sends an UDP packet to dnsserver:53... but already the next 
packet CAN BE malicious. (Another process can take over the port if the former 
has dropped the socket.)

In your case, the socket is allocated once for the whole program. This socket 
is _reused_.

No, as said, your FW is broken.
