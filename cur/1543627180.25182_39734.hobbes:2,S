I'm not (explicitely) using auto-detection. When I insmod the raid0
module, there are no messages about finding devices. All I get is:
md: raid0 personality registered as nr 2
Only when I run raidstart do I get kernel messages about the devices.
In any case, I should be able to move my devices around (especially
if /etc/raidtab is still correct), whether or not autostart is
running. The behaviour I'm observing is a bug (I assume it's not a
mis-feature, since the raidstart man page tells me that moving devices
around should be safe).
