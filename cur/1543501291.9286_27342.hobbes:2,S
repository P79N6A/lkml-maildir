Ok, looking a little more closer it seems that its the following
assignment:
#define TryLockPage(page) \
({ int _ret = test_and_set_bit(PG_locked, &(page)->flags); \
	if (!_ret) page->owner = (int)current; _ret; })
	           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#define UnlockPage(page)    do { \
                    if (page->owner != (int)current) { ...
                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
"page->owner" is an int while current is a pointer variable. Intellism
again :-( Is there a reason why "page->owner" cannot be a pointer type
variable?
Gruss,
