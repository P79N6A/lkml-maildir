What's the purpose of the patch?
Should it enable itself under load, or is it an emergency switch if a
broken driver (or broken hardware) causes an IRQ storm that makes the
computer unusable?
As an emergency switch it's a good idea.
But it should never enable itself unless the box is nearly dead, and it
can't replace NAPI and interrupt mitigation.

Ok, then I like the patch.
