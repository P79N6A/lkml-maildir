Hi,
I have a Logitech PilotMouse+ USB which still fails to work correctly with
the current development kernel (2.3.9). I thought the different protocols in
the USB stack were standardised to avoid this kind of issue, although it
could be a problem elsewhere (eg the PS/2 mouse protocol emulation).
I use SuSE 6.0 with linux-2.3.9 and egcs-1.1.2. When I move the mouse (eg in
XF86Setup) the interrupts are getting through, but I get odd movement, such
as the mouse pointer always seems to want to move up and right on the screen
(positive in the X and Y axis? unsigned?) - sometimes I can get it to move
left, but in large steps, and movement seems to be toggling the button
states too. The buttons and wheel give some response also.
Attached below is the kernel boot messages I get, giving details of the
mouse.
Any further information as to what information I need to collect in order to
help kernel developers, etc would be great. I'd try hacking around with the
USB mouse driver if I
had some documents. Any pointers? I dearly would love to get into developing
for the linux kernel, so I'm eager to try (cautiously).
By the way, a while ago, I got my mouse working with a small USB mouse-test
program either in Inaky's USB driver, or (less likely, but no offence)
Linus's USB driver.
Please post a private copy of your response to me, as I'm not subscribed -
yet.
PS The help for the USB mouse driver in the kernel menuconfig states it taps
into the /dev/ps2aux device, which would be better reading /dev/psaux IMHO.
Thanks in advance,
    Dan
