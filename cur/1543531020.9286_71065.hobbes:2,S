I guaranteed that the memory allocated could be used. I didn't just add
more memory. Just adding more memory will still allow the system to fail,
it may take longer, it may not happen as often. But it can still happen.
The quotas prevent someone from exceeding what is really alloted to the
job. If the job exceeds that quota then something is wrong, it gives a
control point, AND it prevents the "something wrong" from affecting the
rest of the system.
