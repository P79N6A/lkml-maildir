Subject: [PATCH 2/2] x86_64 vDSO: put vars in .rodata
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/24/70

This adds a const to the definitions vvar.c makes, so that the vdso_*
variables go into .rodata instead of .data.  This is essentially a cosmetic
change, just giving the section headers in the vDSO file more pleasing flags.
These variables are read-only from the perspective of the vDSO itself and
user mode, even though the contents of the DSO image were adjusted at boot.
