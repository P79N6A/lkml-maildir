Speaking of kbuild, is there any reasonable way to do check-only runs?
Simple "set CC et.al. to scripts that will create target and do nothing
else" doesn't work for obvious reasons - we have some stuff that really
has to be compiled (e.g. empty.c + some arch-dependent files).  Same
goes for make -n C=1 | grep sparse | ... variants.
Another thing that would be very nice to have: analog of allmodconfig with
some options pre-set.  Trivial cases can be hanlded by patching Kconfig
(basically, adding depends on BROKEN), but IWBN to have something like
make allmodconfig PRESET=<file that looks like a subset of .config>...
