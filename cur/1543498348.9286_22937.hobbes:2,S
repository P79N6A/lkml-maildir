Someone else brought up the point about censoring work other people
contributed, and I agree with that.  I have absolutely no problem
with a developer calling a spade a spade.
However.  For those with delicate sensibilities, I present a humble
patch made against the 2.2.9 kernel source.  It merely adds a make
rule that calls a fairly lame shell script to replace the naughty
words with something a little more Donna Reed.
Chance that it breaks something important: high
Chance that it catches all the bad words : low
But it should be enough to get you started on leading the project
to wash out the kernel source's mouth with soap.
cp repent.patch /usr/src/linux
cd /usr/src/linux
patch -p1 < repent.patch
make repent
And rest easy knowing that you're one of the elite few who are
running a saintly Linux kernel that will probably throw errors
at you left and right as you try to compile it.
Take it easy,
