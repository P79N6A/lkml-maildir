Is actually worse with HZ=1000 ... so I think we still have another problem,
probably with scheduler patches. (the one marked -mm1+p4947 in blue is the
patched one)

in sched.* or something equally obvious? if not, a list of what to blat 
would help me ... or I'll do a crapshoot, and see what falls out ;-)
