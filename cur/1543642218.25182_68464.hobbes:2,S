It was supposed to wait for events to be ready.  In reality what ended up 
happening is that people don't actually like to use io_queue_run/wait and 
the function callbacks as Linus originally suggested in the event model, 
and instead they prefer to use io_getevents directly.  libaio just hasn't 
been updated to reflect that yet.

It was also required to break source compilation for the timeout update.

That was already the intent for libaio-0.4.0.
