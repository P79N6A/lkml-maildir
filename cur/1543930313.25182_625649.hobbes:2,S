I have tried it in a toy kernel. Oskit style. The code reuse is very
high specially with string ops and driver interfaces. Its also very easy
to do unit testing with. My main problem was the quality of the compiler
optimization. Its just not good enough. I think if the compiler can do
the right kind of optimizations correctly then a low overhead OO
language like objective-c can be used in a kernel.
On the other hand its the automated testing part that really matters for
me. Imagine adding features to linux week after week without ever
getting a serious panic or two. And then getting a big performance boost
whenever the compiler does more and more optimizations correctly.

Its all about optimizations.
