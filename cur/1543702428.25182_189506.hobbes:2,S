I have 3 machines running 2.4.22 (Slackware 9.1) and only one of them, 
which happens to be my firewall, sends out TCP sequence numbers starting 
with "0".  This does not seem right to me.  If this is not a bug, I 
apoligize...if anyone thinks it might be, please tell me if you need 
more in-depth info.
