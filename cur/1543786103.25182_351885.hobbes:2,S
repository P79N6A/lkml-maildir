I think keeping John's patch in is fine, especially if you guys
do have the longer term strategy of making pci_resource_to_bus()
work properly on this platform.  Because somewhere down the line
something else will depend upon it being correct, and you'll
need to address this properly.
Actually, some PCI quirk fixups use pcibios_bus_to_resource(), but the
one's that do this are probably not relevant on ia64.
