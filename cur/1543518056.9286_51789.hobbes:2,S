Note that you don't have to start it from the bottom. In many cases it is
_easier_ to start it from the top: make a simple "device structure" that
in the first incarnation has nothing but (a) major/minor number and (b) a
reference count (we need the latter to make sure that we get the dynamic
behaviour right).
Then, all old code can be used pretty much without any changes, because
they still use MAJOR(kdev)/MINOR(kdev), and that's trivial to implement.
After that, we can migrate things one concept at a time over to just be
included directly in the device structure - things like hardware blocks
sizes, size of the device etc etc. The initial thing doesn't have to be
very large at all.
