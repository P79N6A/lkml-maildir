No Greg.  People keep asking, because you continue to give an answer
that is 'correct' but does not answer the question people 'meant' to
ask.
Andreas Jellinghaus <aj@dungeon.inka.de> gave an excellent answer -
which I shall blatantly quote:
-------------------------
Q: devfs did load drivers when someone tried to open() a non existing
device. will sysfs/hotplug/udev do this?
A: there is no need to. hotplug/sysfs/udev will create devices for all
hardware supported by the kernel and the available modules. it will do
that during boot up, and whenever new hardware is added. so you can
expect all devices be already present, no need for a devfs like
mechanism.
-------------------------
And there you have it  :)
