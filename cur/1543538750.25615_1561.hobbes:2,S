Hi,
I don't know if this has already been explored or not but it is aparent
that all kernels starting with test2 have broken 3d support under
Linux.  I know this is true at least for my 3Dfx Voodoo 3 3500 and
probably for a G400 I'm working with.  When I run Quake 3 it says it
can't find the hardware.  What happened?
Thanks,
