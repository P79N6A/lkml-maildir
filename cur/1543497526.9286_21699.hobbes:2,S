The initrd system is good (conceptually, it makes a helluva lot of
things make sense), although it really could stand some improvements
-- chiefly by using "mount" and be passed a path or a file descriptor
for the root rather than passing a device number, since that doesn't
apply to all filesystems.  With initrd done properly, we should be
able to nuke the in-kernel IP configuration and NFSroot support as
well... mounting NFS as root would then simply be a matter of letting
initrd set up your IP stack, mount the root, and switch.  This is a
*good thing*.
