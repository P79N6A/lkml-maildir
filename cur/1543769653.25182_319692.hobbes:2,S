I don't have the complete race scenario, just a stack that suggests that
files->fd was corrupted.  This problem isn't recreatable at will (yet), so this
is really based on a thought experiment more than anything else.  The conditions
that I was envisioning was a multithreaded application in which two threads
modified  the same file descriptor at the same time.  Its my understanding, from
the way I read the code that the ref count on a file_struct will still be one
for a multithreaded application, and as such it would be possible, using the
fget_light routine for one thread to be be preforming an operation on an
descriptor in the fd array, while another thread preformed another operation on
it (say close).  The result potentially would be (if the two operations were on
the same fd index), that the routine operating in fget_light would retrieve a
corrupted fd value from the files->fd array, since it was being modified at the
same time by another execution context. Given the above, I suppose it might be
more appropriate to increment the reference count on thread creation as well as
process creation,  but I wasn't certain of the potential side effects of doing
so.  Also, every other location in the vfs that calls fcheck_files to retrieve a
value out of file_structs fd array, do so under the protection of the
file_structs file_lock, so this really seemed like a candidate for race badness
to me.
