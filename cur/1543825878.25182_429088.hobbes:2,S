For some reason the lockdep code expected that hardirqs would be enabled.

So it's claiming that we're taking multiple i_mutexes.
I can't immediately see where we took the outermost i_mutex there.  Nor is
it immediately obvious why this is considered to be deadlockable?
(lockdep tells us that a mutex was taken at "mutex_lock+0x8/0xa", which is
fairly useless.  We need to report who the caller of mutex_lock() was).
