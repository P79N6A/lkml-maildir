"Holding" rcu_read_lock() for long time periods is much less of a
concern than holding other types of synchronization mechanisms.
The main concern is the effect on realtime latency in CONFIG_PREEMPT
(but -not- CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT) kernels.  This concern is due to the
fact that rcu_read_lock() suppresses preemption in CONFIG_PREEMPT
kernels.
But I have to ask: roughly how long is "quite long"?
