Subject: [PATCH] 2.4.0-test4 kswapd rebalancing fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Hi,
the attached patch should fix the following things in
2.4.0-test4:
- kswapd keeping too much memory free
- bad performance in some cases because kswapd doesn't
  have the ability to properly balance between zones
(this patch was created in 1 minute in response to a complaint
from some people on #kernelnewbies, I'm working on the new VM
myself and won't take any time to defend or talk about this patch
if it turns out people for some reason don't like it)
regards,
Rik
