   egrep "promiscuous mode" net/core/dev.c | grep printk
I noticed when I performed the grep, the printk shows:
      printk(KERN_INFO "device %s %s promiscuous mode\n"
For the sake of consistency and automatic error log analysis, it might be
nice to standardize on a message closer to:
      printk(KERN_INFO "%s: %s promiscuous mode\n"
It's somewhat common, but not universal to start the error message with the
device name followed by a colon.
