At least for TCP reception, the architecture is in place:
[net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c]
        /* Try to use the device checksum if provided. */
        switch (skb->ip_summed) {
        case CHECKSUM_NONE:
                skb->csum = csum_partial((char *)th, len, 0);
        case CHECKSUM_HW:
                if(tcp_v4_check(th,len,skb->nh.iph->saddr,skb->nh ......
(meaning that it skips the csum_partial on incoming fragments if it knows
the network driver already has filled in a value in skb->csum)
Anyway, if noone seems to be working on the zero-copy framework, I'll just
have to go ahead and try to hack it in :) But I'm very sure that I saw
exactly this in the slides from last years USENIX, in a speech by someone
about future Linux network development.
