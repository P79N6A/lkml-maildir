Subject: [PATCH 2/4] reparent_thread: fix the "is it traced" check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

reparent_thread() uses ptrace_reparented() to check whether this thread
is ptraced, in that case we should not notify the new parent.
But ptrace_reparented() is not exactly correct when the reparented thread
is traced by /sbin/init, because forget_original_parent() has already
changed ->real_parent.
Currently, the only problem is the false notification. But with the next
patch the kernel crash in this (yes, pathological) case.
