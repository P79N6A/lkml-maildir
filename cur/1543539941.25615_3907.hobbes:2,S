On SERVER cmdline. Not on DOS one. You should see ':_' on server console.
Just type 'set display watchdog logouts = on' here. No offtime. It acts
immediately, without any reboot.

If you do not know that your server has 'set' command - then there is
no surprise that that ncpfs does not work for you...

Fix it or leave it...

2.2.0.17 ncpd can kill itself if fork() after message comes in fails.
It should not happen, but if you are not willing to look into your
logs, you should at least update all software to latest versions.
