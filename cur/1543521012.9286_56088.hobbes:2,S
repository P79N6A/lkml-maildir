You could also just have a config file like /etc/auditopen containing the capability list of the binaries.
What is wrong with that?

You could say that the max list of capabilities is the complete list of sys_calls.

What do you mean?

You could think of extending the configfile from a binary specific to a binary and process specific. But as far as I can see binary specific will to enough. Could you give me an example where binary specific configfiles are not enough?
