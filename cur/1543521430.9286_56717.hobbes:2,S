There is something seriously wrong with libc that causes this bloat.  The
following program compiles to 202640 bytes on my system:
	int main() { }
	
Compiled with:
	gcc -static -s -O testy.c -o testy
	
Even if you don't want them, you end up linking in malloc, stdio, and other
large chunks of useless stuff because the init/shutdown code (crt*.o) needs
to initialize these subsystems.  Some clever changes to libc would
dramatically improve this situation, but it would take some work.  Someday,
perhaps I'll have a chance...
For a solution that might be slightly less work, you could look at Cygnus
newlib (sourceware.cygnus.com) but it will need some tweaking to work with a
Linux target, I think.
Have fun,
Avery
