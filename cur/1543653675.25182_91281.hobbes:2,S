Hi,
concerning all intersil-based cards, the linux-wlan-ng driver seems much
more efficient than the in-kernel or pcmcia-cs code. However, linux-wlan-ng
supports only prism cards.
In general, if you have a low-performance machine, go for a real PCI card
(like one of those mini-pci boards on a pci adaptor card, like the Tekram
PC-400 or what it's name is). The pcmcia cards (at least those non-cardbus,
i did not have my hands on a cardbus card yet) impose a great load on the
machine for transferring the data over the "ISA" bus.
(That's another big problem of the in-kernel and pcmcia-cs "orinoco" drivers:
for full-size packets, interrupts are blocked for almost 1ms for every
packet. Not a problem on a GHz machine, but ugly on a 75MHz pentium 8) )
Regards,
Wolfgang
