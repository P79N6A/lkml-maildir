	And what exactly do you think is stored in the shadow file?
	Clue alert:  They are one-way hashes!  It uses either a DES based
hash with the password as the key to encrypt a known value or using MD5!
The only additional security with the shadow file is that it is readable
only by root, and that's actually one thing that Windows NT does BETTER.
On Window NT, the SAM database is actually open and locked by the operating
system and is not directly readable by ANYONE (not even the administrators)
while the OS is booted.  That means crack the OS, physical access to reboot,
or brute force.  With the shadow password, you only have to break root.
Then you have full access.
	BTW...  NTLM hashes (as opposed to LanMan hashes) are just as hard
to crack as the MD5 hashes in the shadow password file and a hell of a lot
harder to crack than the DES based hashes.  Things like L0phtCrack for
cracking NT passwords depends on getting at the LanMan hashes which are
much easier to bust (lame comes to mind there).
	There are "other techniques" which are not in general circulation
for busting certain password attributes off the wire with SMB protocols
but nothing that's inherent with one-way hashes in general.
