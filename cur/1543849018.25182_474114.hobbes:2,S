You are right, I understand this now, I knew the meaning of "vanilla source" 
but didn't come in my mind that 	debian 2.6.8 for example is not vanilla 
source but a tree based on vanilla including patches from debian developers, 
sorry. I will follow Jacob's advice and I will ask in beowulf mailing list 
about what kernel I should use. I am two days in linux kernel lists and I can 
see that you work really hard here, so I won't annoy you again with such 
questions.
keep up the good work, all of you,
Panos
