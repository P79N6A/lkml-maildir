Did not help. Instead, this seems to be working with X.org and opensource driver:
chvt 1
vbetool vbestate save > /tmp/state
echo 3 > /proc/acpi/sleep
vbetool post
vbetool vbestate restore < /tmp/state
chvt 7
(if X server is running then chvt to text console is necessary, but it works
including DRI and XV overlay running) 
Can I get the current console so that chvt 7 can switch to the original console?
Just re-POST seems to initialize first head connected to external CRT. The
second head (connected to LFP) is not initialized. Do not know why :(
This is the videocard: Intel Corp. 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device.
