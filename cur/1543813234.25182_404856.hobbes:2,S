    Not exactly kernel related, but anyway: I wrote almost a month
ago to Menarini Diagnostics. They make glucometers, and the latest
model they sell can be connected to the PC with a special cable. Of
course, Windows.
    Since no Linux support is provided for this useful device, I did
an offer to Menarini: if they provided me with the cable and the
specs, I'll write a Linux driver and/or a Linux application to
support *their* product at no cost. I would do it for free because
I'm very interested in connecting my glucometer to my Linux box.
    I made clear that the driver and/or app would be GPL'd, but on
the other hand I made clear too that I won't release the specs they
would give me if they didn't want to (except of course those bits
exposed by the source code itself).
    I haven't got any answer from them. I can use other glucometer,
of course, but this one is, IMHO, the best one in the market and I
don't think any other vendor would give me specs for their products.
    And please note that I'm not talking about all the specifications
of the glucometer: they can keep secret the way the glucometer makes
the measurements, I don't give a heck about that. I only want the
*communication* specs, so I'm able to retrieve data from the
glucometer through the cable (which is USB, AFAIK, so probably it
won't need a new driver).

    Probably, but if I make something for free, I think I should have
the right to impose distribution conditions, and GPL restrictions
seem to be very reasonable to me: if you use my work, you cannot
avoid others using it, and if you make a modification of my work, you
cannot distribute a binary of that modified work without the source.
    For me, not getting an answer from a vendor is too much to
handle. Having to buy a cable myself and doing reverse engineering to
make something I own work with my operating system is too much to
handle.
    I don't know how much Menarini paid for the Windows version of
the software. Probably more than the entire Linux kernel will cost to
produce in its entire life. The cost of a Linux version for them will
be a cable and a PDF document of the communication specification,
which probably will be a known protocol. They don't want to do it
because: a) they don't understand a word of the open source movement
and how it can be used to save money; or b) they're so stupid,
stubborn and money avid that won't do anything that doesn't involve
money, even if the money goes out of their own pockets!

    I utterly agree. The tone in this list may be "strong", but it is
an open list nonetheless and I think all Linux hackers out there will
be happy to hear from some vendor doing a cooperation offer.
    Up to this point, Menarini doesn't seem to be one of them,
though.
