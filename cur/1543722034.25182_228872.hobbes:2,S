When building modules they use _both_ the source and partly the output.
The output needed is what is required for kbuild to work, and optionally
Module.symvers for symbol versions.

Did you put the output of the kernel compile in a separate output directory,
reusing the same src for several configurations?
If not you do not need the change, and thus do not get any benefit. On the
other hand everything should work as-is for you.
