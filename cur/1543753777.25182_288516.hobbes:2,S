OK, I finally come around to answering this ...

I should have avoided earlier confusing the use of a certain type of
relayfs channel for a given purpose (i.e. LTT should not necessarily
depend on the managed mode.) I believe that there is a need for
more than one mode in relayfs independently of LTT. There are users
who want to be able to manage the data in a buffer (by manage I mean:
receive notification of important buffer events, be able to insert
important data at boundaries, etc.), and there are users who just
want to dump as much information as possible in as fast a way as
possible without having to deal with non-essential codepaths.

looking at this code:
1) get_cpu() and put_cpu() won't do. You need to outright disable
interrupts because you may be called from an interrupt handler.
2) You assume that relayfs creates one buffer per cpu for each
channel. We think this is wrong. Relayfs should not need to care
about the number of CPUs, it's the clients' responsibility to
create as many channels as they see fit, whether it be one channel
per CPU or 10 channels per CPU or 1 channel per interrupt, etc.
3) I'm unclear about the need for local_add_return(), why not
just:
	if (likely(buffer->offset + length <= buffer->size)
In any case, here's what we do in relay_write():
	write_pos = relay_reserve(rchan, count, &reserve_code, &interrupting);
If there's any buffer switching required, that will be done in
relay_reserve. This has the added advantage that clients that
want to write directly to the buffer without using relay_write()
can do so by calling relay_reserve() and not care about required
buffer switching.
4) After securing the area, you simply go ahead and do a memcpy()
and leave. We think that this is insufficient. Here's what we
do:
	if (likely(write_pos != NULL)) {
		relay_write_direct(write_pos, data_ptr, count);
		relay_commit(rchan, write_pos, count, reserve_code, interrupting);
		*wrote_pos = write_pos;
the relay_write_direct() is basically an memcpy(). We also do
a relay_commit(). This actually effects the delivery of the
event. If, for example, there had been a buffer switch at the
previous relay_reserve(), then this call to relay_commit() will
generate a call to the client's deliver() callback function.
In the case of LTT, for example, this is how it knows that it's
got to notify the user-space daemon that there are buffers to
consume (i.e. write to disk.)

Actually no, you don't want ltt_log_event using relay_write(),
for one thing because is can generate variable size events.
Instead, ltt_log_event does (basically):
	data_size = sizeof(event_id) + sizeof(time_delta) + sizeof(data_size);
	relay_lock_channel();
	relay_reserve();
	relay_write_direct(&event_id, sizeof(event_id));
	relay_write_direct(&time_delta, sizeof(event_id));
	if (var_data) {
		relay_write_direct(var_data, var_data_len);
		data_size += var_data_len;
	}
	relay_write_direct(&data_size, sizeof(data_size));
	relay_commit();
	relay_unlock_channel();

I hope the above explanation clarifies things.

Ordering is a non-issue to be honest. Unless you've got some hardware
scope in there, it's almost impossible to pinpoint exactly when an
event occurred. There is no single line of code where an event occurs,
so it's all an educated guess anyway. You want things to resemble what
really happened in as much as possible though.

ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, OK!
You've hit it enough times on its head that I'll actually have to answer.
In terms of low runtime overhead, you are correct, the requirements overlap,
and I will agree to do my best to trim down LTT to make it useable for
kernel tracing without jeopardizing its existing purpose.
I'll start this separately in a "Ripping LTT apart" thread.
In regards to relayfs, I think that LTT should run on both modes
transparently. Unlike what I said before, no single mode should be tied
to LTT. If you want tracing with the ad-hoc mode, then fine, you should
be able to do that. There is merit in keeping both relayfs modes,
irrespective of what modes LTT uses. A review of the managed and adhoc
code should consider all clients, including LTT,  as potential users of
both. Sure, we'll want to optimize the managed mode in as much as
possible, but its functionality stands on its own and is different from
that of the ad-hoc mode. The difference between these modes is akin the
difference between GFP_KERNEL, GFP_ATOMIC, GFP_USER, etc.: same API,
different underlying functionality.
