Subject: Errors in i810 DRM driver, 2.4.21-pre5-ac1

Hello!
When I boot 2.4.21-pre5-ac1 on a system with an i810 card and i810 DRM
supported in the kernel, following lines are printed continuously to the
kernel log:
PCI: Found IRQ 12 for device 00:01.0
[drm:i810_wait_ring] *ERROR* space: 65520 wanted 65528
[drm:i810_wait_ring] *ERROR* lockup
mtrr: base(0xd0000000) is not aligned on a size(0x180000) boundary
The same messages were observed with 2.4.21-pre4-ac7.  I haven't tried
other -ac kernels on that machine.
The system feels significantly slower.  I have X and gdm running, the
messages are printed on the serial console.  The workaround is to stop X
by "init 3" - the messages stop and the system becomes more responsive.
The system is Red Hat 8.0, kernel 2.4.21-pre5-ac1, XFree86-4.2.0-72,
gdm-2.4.0.7-13 (two later are native from Red Hat).  No modules are
loaded.

There is an interesting message when compiling i810_dma.c (most likely
irrelevant, but I'll report it anyway):
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
-Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe
-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=i686   -nostdinc -iwithprefix include

In file included from drmP.h:75,
                 from i810_dma.c:35:

read up on list_entry
This patch fixes the loop, but it's really just a random fix without
understanding anything:

Still, the following messages are printed 4 times on startup:
