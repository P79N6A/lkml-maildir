It's not slower in any of the tests I've run.  The crypto code needs a 
tweak (the next version I send out will have that fix), and I'm still 
working on getting thread_info to be relative to current, which should 
save a bit more code.  The assembly I've looked at tends to be better 
as gcc can access various fields by directly offseting current instead 
of the inline asm load then store that is otherwise needed.
