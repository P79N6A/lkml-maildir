Do you want to write all code?
In most cases, the hardware is only vaguely documented. And the
hardware comes in many variants, regarding manufacturer and series.
But the VGA card bios has all the knowledge you need. It knows even
the exact minor version of the hardware, which XFree should probe for
in a _big_ case statement, if you can probe for it at all.
No, doing it with the BIOS is the best way.
