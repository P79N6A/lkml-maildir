No, it hasn't quite the same effect:

Check if you also built the initrd the same way as the distributed one,
i.e. examine their contents. If it was, try booting an own kernel and
initrd built from FC6's 2.6.18-* sources. If that fails too, build a
kernel with all drivers compiled in which you know you need to access
the root FS. If that kernel still fails to mount the root FS, look for
any earlier error messages in the boot sequence.
