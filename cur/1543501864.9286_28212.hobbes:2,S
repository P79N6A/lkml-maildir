Could you give a listing of the directory where it happens (with the old
kernel, that is)? Does ls -l break on it? ls -f? It would help a lot...

Alan, that could be tested easier: -ac6. What bothers me is that the same
behaviour was reported on 2.3.x (only *now*, damnit!). Besides, getdents()
shouldn't care at all - all recent changes are in lookup() path.
Sigh... Folks, if something breaks - *report* it. If it was broken in
2.3.x and somebody knew it...
