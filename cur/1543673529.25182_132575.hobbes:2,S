Yes, it certainly could.  The other part of the problem, which I failed to
mention, is that the Resume-Detect bit in the USB controller's status
register is set.  wakeup_hc() gets called only if that bit is set, and the
bit is supposed to be set only if some device attached to the USB bus has
requested a wakeup (also known as "resume").  If there's nothing on the
bus, the controller shouldn't indicate that a resume was detected.
