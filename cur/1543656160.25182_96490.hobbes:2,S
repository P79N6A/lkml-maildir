Well, like I thought, this BIOS (it's an ASUS A7V333 mobo) doesn't have
an option for PCI Byte Merging - it has very few PCI options at all.
I'm going to update the BIOS to see if that gains me anything useful.
I took a clean 2.4.20 source tree and overlaid it with the contents of
aic79xx-linux-2.4.20-20021213.tar.gz, and it doesn't seem to have fixed
the problem completely, though it is *much* harder to trigger it now - I
thought it was working, but the same problem reappeared after copying
just over 4.5Gb to a tape.
As I mentioned in my reply to Keith, the NMI watchdog isn't even
triggering after this crash, which seems a little odd to me.
