As a sys-admin, let me add a vote for this. Having (one day) a prom monitor 
program that looks at all the disks, and gives a menu of which one to boot 
from would make life so nice.
I very often had to move disks from one platform to another, and changing ID's 
on the was hard or impossible in some cases, and required in others. Being 
able to find the disk by a label is a thousand times better.
