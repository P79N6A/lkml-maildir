Ok.
Why are all these workarounds preferred, instead of proper suspend
support for swap files?
IOW, what reasons are there to *not* support swap files, other than the
hit-and-miss Linux suspend support?
I brought up the swap file issue to illustrate that writing
hibernation images to files needs to be supported anyway.  Once you
have that, there is no good reason to write the hibernation image to
swap, and several reasons not to.
That my particular problem might be messily worked around isn't really
important in the context of that argument, which no one has responded
to.
(Aside from adding more administrivia to my Macintosh's setup, your
LVM suggestion would prevent the ext3 drivers for Windows and OS X
from working, as they don't do LVM.  This is arguably not Linux's
problem -- but Linux *already supports* a working solution).
