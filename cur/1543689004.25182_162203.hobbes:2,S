Not quite true.  The above is an implicit call to alloca and should
not exist in the kernel.  No need to hack support into sparse.
Petri's code below has constant array bounds, once the preprocessing
is done, that should be fixed in sparse.

Sorry, I've just had a casual glance at sparse so far.  Looks like a
preprocessing problem, that's all I can say.

Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is
frequently going to be big, don't get fancy.
