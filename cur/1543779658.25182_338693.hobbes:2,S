Yeah, bugs in the kernel :-)
I can change the patch to just see who is hogging the CPU for more than
X amount of seconds (10 by default) if that pleases everyone. If that's
what people want, then I'll send another patch tomorrow. If this is the
way to go, then I'll add back the check for RT tasks to limit the output
to just RT hogs.  Or is any hog OK?
I guess this would at least keep it arch independent.  Although I like
my little hack with the additions to thread_info and entry.S ;-)
