I'm not convinced that moving the referenced bit check inside writepage()
is worth it. We will duplicate code which is purely a VM job (ie check the
referenced bit and possibly remove the page from the inactive dirty list
and add it to the active list, _with_ the pagemap_lru_lock held), not a
pager job.
The PageDirty bit handling is different IMHO --- the pager is the one who
knows if it actually wrote the page or not.
