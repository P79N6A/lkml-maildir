They cannot coexist _at the same time in the same agreement_, but a
single work can be licensed out hundreds of times in different ways.
If I hold the copyright on something, I can provide a different license
to each licensee of the product if I so choose.  That is pretty common,
in fact.
The GPL and some-other-license are incompatible in the sense that  you
cannot put another license on _top_ of the GPL in the _same_ licensing
agreement.  But you are free to license something in the GPL _or_ BSD
_or_ some-evil-EULA, and that is what Linus et al are talking about, and
_not_ what the FSF means when they say that some license is incompatible
with the GPL.
