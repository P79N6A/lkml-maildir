Hi all,
I'm trying to read application id, volume id and stuff from cds, but 
don't figure out how to do it. It looks like ioctls CDROMREADMODE1 /
CDROMREADMODE2 may be the way to do it, but the kernel show a read error
when i try to read the data. What is needed in the struct cdrom_read to
make the ioctl works? And if i'm wrong, and that's very likely ;), what's
it the way to obtain these data from the cd?
tia
