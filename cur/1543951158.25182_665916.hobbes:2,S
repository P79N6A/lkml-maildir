Also my objection about breaking backward compatibility for fuse
filesystems is still seemingly unaddressed.
I know it would be more convenient to push this problem into the fuse
filesystems, but they are unfortunately on the other side of the
stable kernel ABI, so this is not an option.
I've already presented a solution (which wasn't greeted with big
enthusiasm), and I'm open to discussion about other ways to solve
this.
