Hi
Out of curiosity, will ALSA also be available on the 24..xx kernels??
Will there be a choice of useing OSS or ALSA??
Will the ALSA drivers be the 0.9 series or the old 0.5 series??? AFAIK they 
are very very different in architecture.
I welcome the use of ALSA, as it appears to be a more flexibile solution and 
can be used with OSS compatibility from an application point of view. My only 
concern is that there is a potential for looseing support for some sound 
cards.
