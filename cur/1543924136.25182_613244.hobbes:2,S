Subject: [PATCH 0/7] struct path related cleanups of d_path() code
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/1/309

Here are some more struct path cleanups. This patch series changes d_path() to
take a struct path argument. The existing users are changed to give struct path
more deeply into the call chain. In some structures I need to replace existing
<dentry,vfsmount> pairs and embed a struct path instead.
Andreas,
since JJ just posted the AppArmor related d_path() patches I don't include
them here too.
Comments?
