It tested fine on a UP/IO-APIC AMD and on an SMP AMD, as well as on an SMP
Xeon P4, all of them running UP kernels. It also tested fine on the SMP 
AMD and Xeon, running SMP kernels. Sorry it took so long to reply, I 
couldn't reboot these machines right away. :-)
I'd say your patch is ready for inclusion in at least the -ac kernels.
Thanks,
Ion
