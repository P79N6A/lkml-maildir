Off course I must load the gre module. But how do I 
set it up?
I found some keywords on this mailing list, like
ip-tunnels.tex,
iproute2,
ip tu ad gre1 mode gre ttl 64 remote 1.2.3.4 local 5.6.7.8
Does this refer to modprobe arguments or some utils I don't know?
Where do I find more information?
I want the gre tunnel on a lan<->lan ipchain'd firewall.
How do I tell ipchains to allow access to the tunnel?
I also need to pass igmp. I assume that I just tell ipchains
to allow protocol 2 (/etc/protocols says it's protocol 2).
All this is because I want to replace a cisco PIX firewall with
an ipchain'd linux box (redhat-6.0). Somebody inside who use
mbone says I should not use mroted, but tunnels.
On the inside there is a cisco 1000 talking pim through a
tunnel to an outside cisco 4513.
The kernel is 2.2.5-15 (redhat-6.0 standard).
