Subject: bug in sys_getpid() comment?

this is sys_getpid() on 2.4.19
asmlinkage long sys_getpid(void)
{
        /* This is SMP safe - current->pid doesn't change */
        return current->tgid;
}
I assume we are returning tgid so that no matter what thread of a
multithreaded program calls getpid we return the same value, and that
the comment with pid is old and should have been updated when it was
changed to return tgid.  A student in my Operating Systems class pointed
this out, so I figured no harm in pointing the possible bug out.
thanks,
shaya
