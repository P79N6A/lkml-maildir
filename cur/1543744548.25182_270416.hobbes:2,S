Han's method is also very likely nugatory within the USA.

 clearly states that to
transfer title of copyrighted work requires a written instrument of
conveyance. That instrument of conveyance has to be signed and should in
many ways look a lot like a deed or title for real estate -- ie. it must
denote the boundaries of the transaction in a specific and explicit
manner. In this instance it would probably be required to state in as
unambiguous manner as possible which files and which versions this
transfer is to cover. In the case of patches to preexisting files; it
should also be specific as to which lines are to be covered unless one
writes it in a style like a "Quit Claim Deed".
