Yes, good point.

Point is, names matter as much as inodes do.  And it's possible to
get improperly labelled data in canonical location for object (i.e.
/etc/shadow).  Certainly requires unconfined help, but real people do
things like that w/out fully understanding the impact.  You can fix the
normal tools, but not all one-off admin tools.

Hehe, why would I do that if I'm trying to get unconfined process to
break the label? ;-)

That's my point.  You can't meaningfully reason about the security of
the system with unconfined processes.
