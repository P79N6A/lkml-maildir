Why?  POSIX have gotten *lots* of things wrong in the past.  
For example, using 512 byte units for df and du (which we ignore, and
for which the POSIX will hopefully eventually catch up with sanity)
and fcntl unlocking semantics (which we adhere to despite the fact
that is broken beyond belief, and very likely will and will continue
to cause application bugs in the feature).  What we do when POSIX does
something idiotic is something that has to be addressed on a
case-by-case basis.
