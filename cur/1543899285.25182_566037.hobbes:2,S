and rt18 was a -rt-only NOHZ fix, that bug got introduced in rt11 when 
CFS was merged.
i _think_ Rui might have seen two separate problems. Perhaps by the time 
we fixed the first problem (which Rui saw since -rt2) we introduced the 
other one via -rt11 - which then got fixed in -rt19.
btw., we'd love to get more feedback regarding CFS. CFS is a completely 
new scheduler for Linux. It has a design centered around keeping 
application latencies down, so it is ultimately real-time friendly, and 
it should also make things work better for desktop-ish and audio-ish 
stuff as well. (even under SCHED_OTHER)
So it would be nice if you could keep an extra eye on any scheduling 
artifacts or regressions, and make sure your favorite workload is still 
handled by the Linux scheduler in the utmost best way. I'd like to hear 
about any sort of "scheduling behavior / interactivity" regression you 
might see, relative to the vanilla kernel. Or if you can see no such 
problems then a line of "it works as well as the previous scheduler" is 
important info to us too. Thanks!
