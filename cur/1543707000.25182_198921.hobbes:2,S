I know. But this requires some very ugly workarounds outside
of module-init-tools. For example, if you want to check
whether a module $module_name has already been loaded, you
cannot use
     grep -q "^${module_name} " /proc/modules
Instead you have to use a workaround like
     x="`echo $module_name | sed -e 's/-/_/g'`"
     cat /proc/modules | sed -e 's/-/_/g' | grep -q "^${x} "
This is inefficient and error-prone.
Maybe somebody has another idea for the workaround,
but I like the first version.
