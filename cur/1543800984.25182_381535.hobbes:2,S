Not to disrespect Miklos's work, but relying on FUSE for such a fundamental 
problem is probably not a good idea. Most people probably do not compile FUSE 
into their kernel.
I do agree with other posters here that OSS compatibility a) needs to be 
improved and b) should not be limited to the features of the soundcard (i.e. 
it must software mix). As Andi has pointed out, wholly removing OSS is not in 
the spirit of Linux and will not happen for many years.
