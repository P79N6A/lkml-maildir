Yeah, yeah, let's first close stderr, and then proceed and 
add some code to handle command line --log=file, and to do
logging to that file.
Why good ol' fprintf(stderr,...) isn't enough? Why do you
want to complicate things?
What's so hard in doing "daemon 2>/dev/null &" if you don't
want to save log?
