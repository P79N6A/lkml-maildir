I'm sure there's a problem in _my_ understanding, but isn't the displacement
- as specified by AT&T syntax - represented in bytes ?. I've wrote a small
assembly function to be sure:
.data
integer:
	.string "%d\n"
.text
test_func:
	push	%ebp
	mov	%esp, %ebp
	push	0x008(%ebp)   ## 8 bytes displacement (the first arg), right ?
	push	$integer
	call 	printf
	mov	%ebp, %esp
	pop	%ebp
	ret
The above method works fine and prints "5" to stdout by the code:
.global	main
main:
	mov	$5, %eax
	push	%eax
	call	test_func
	movl	$1, %eax
	movl	$0, %ebx
	int	$0x80
now back to head.S code:
 	leal    0x007(%edi),%ecx	/* Create PDE entry */
Isn't the above line the same condition (bytes, not bits displacement) ?. 
Thanks for your patience !.
(For other kind replies, don't understand me wrong. I did my homework and
 studied the pte format before asking ;). It's just the bytes/bits issue 
 above that confuses me).
