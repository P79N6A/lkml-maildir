So if an application or glibc _does_ start passing in non-1 values, it
will malfunction on earlier kernels?
So that userspace code would need to have a test for the kernel version, I
assume?
All a bit of a hassle.  Still, I'd propose that this change (if the
thus-far-silent cc'ees agree with it?) go into 2.6.22.x at least.  If it
gets accepted into 2.6.22.x then applications (or glibc) will need to test
for kernels as far back as 2.6.22.  Really they would need to test for the
correct value of x in 2.6.22.x, but I don't know if glibc is set up for
that.
Thoughts?
