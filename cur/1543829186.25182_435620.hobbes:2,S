The structure is used as volatile throughout.
I personally didn't ever like to use structures for registers, but this is actually an old driver written first at the time ARM compilers produced more optimal code when the registers were accessed through structures.

The reason behind that is that the other target which has this bus has absolutely different clock layout so it's hard to combine those. Therefore clock stuff was pus into arch-specific part.

Well, the reason is the same as mentioned above.
