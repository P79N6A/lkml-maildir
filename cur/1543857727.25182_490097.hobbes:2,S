Trivial patches tend not to be a priority for most people, especially
during a period when people are gearing up for the close of the merge
window (unless they happen to fix a serious bug, in which case it's
another matter, and it should also be brought to -stable's attention).
Timing has a lot to do with expected feedback for these sorts of things.
trivial@kernel.org exists to handle the rest of the bits, where Adrian
has a tendency to queue up many trivial and related patches at once, and
sending out pull requests at a time where it will be less disruptive to
the rest of development. You might be better off simply CC'ing trivial@
on these patch submissions and routinely checking the trivial git tree to
see whether they've been queued or not.
However, if you're changing or reordering functionality that isn't an
obvious bugfix, you're still going to have to get an ack from the
maintainer.
