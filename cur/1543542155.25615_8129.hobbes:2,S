    If my benching is right he has rather few instructions to make a
    clone 1000x faster ;)
Nobody has defined faster... what if he is talking about metrics
other than thread/lwp creation? How does an application that makes
heavy use of threads scale under linux compared to SCO?
I know of at least one application that, under Solaris pthreads
scales _much_ better if you have hundreds or thousands of threads
(Solaris has hybrid user/kernel threads).
Sure, this isn't necessarily a kernel issue but as Andi and other
people have pointed out, most programmers don't distinguish.
