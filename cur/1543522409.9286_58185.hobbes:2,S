The thing is, that you can do that as easily in user space by having a
"ext2fastcheck" thing or similar, something that CAN make sense. 
What it really is, is just a "fast fsck". And it should be treated as
such. It should _not_ be some silly mount option.

Agreed. I think the current mke2fs uses 4kB blocks by default if the
filesystem size is larger than some arbitrary number (a few hundred meg, I
think).

Which is not all that stupid, considering that a number of 2.2.x kernels
don't support it, I guess..

At least the blocksize thing is rather hard to fix in place. I suspect the
complexity is equivalent to writing a good de-fragger.
