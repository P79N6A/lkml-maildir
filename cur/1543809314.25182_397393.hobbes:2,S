How do you get top to display which CPU tasks are running on?

I'm still having trouble getting my head around this.  A task shouldn't 
be moved unless there's at least one other task on its current CPU, it 
(the task to be moved) is cache cold and it (the task to be moved) is 
not the currently active task.  In these circumstances, moving the task 
to an idle CPU should be a "good thing" unless the time taken for the 
move is longer than the time that will pass before the task becomes the 
running task on its current CPU.
For a nice==-20 task to be hopping from CPU to CPU there must be higher 
(or equal) priority tasks running on each of the CPUs that it gets 
booted off at the time it gets booted off.

Yes, this is an issue but it's not restricted to HT systems (except for 
the same package part).  The latest patch that I've posted addresses 
(part of) this problem by replacing SCHED_LOAD_SCALE with the average 
load per runnable task in the code at the end of find_busiest_group() 
which handles the case where imbalance is small.  This should enable 
load balancing to occur even if all runnable tasks are low priority.
The issue of the two tasks ending up on the same package isn't (as far 
as I can see) caused by the smpnice load balancing changes.
