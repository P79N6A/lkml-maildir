When I first generated plugsched and posted it to lkml for inclusion in -mm it 
was blocked as having no chance of being included by both Ingo and Linus and 
I doubt they've changed their position since then. As you're well aware this 
is why I gave up working on it and let you maintain it since then. Obviously 
I thought it was a useful feature or I wouldn't have worked on it.
