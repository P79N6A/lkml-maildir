Subject: why no call to add_interrupt_randomness() on PPC?

With all the talk about randomness, I went to see where my current system
(2.2.19 on PPC) was getting random numbers from.  I was kind of surprised to see
that there is no call to add_interrupt_randomness() in arch/ppc/kernel/irq.c.
Does anyone know why this call is not present in ppc_irq_dispatch_handler()? 
Would it be appropriate for me to make a patch for this?  Who would be the
appropriate person to send this to?
Thanks,
Chris
