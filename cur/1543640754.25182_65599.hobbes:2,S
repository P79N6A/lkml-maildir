Subject: [PATCH] An option to make fcntl & flock locks fair
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Shlomi Fish asked about including first-come, first-served style locking
for posix and flock locks.  After some back-and-forth, we came up with
the following patch which seems unintrusive enough to bother including.
Personally, I doubt the utility of this, but someone might have an
application for it, and the code's already written.
