I tried the first patch, got the following error:
Kernel panic - not syncing: copy_context_skas0 : failed to wait for 
SIGUSR1/SIGTRAP, pid = 7182, n = 7182, errno = 0, status = 0xb7f
I got the same error even after applying the second patch.
My run command is the following:
linux stderr=1 ubd0=../../root_fs.rh-7.2-full.pristine.20020312
