You probably misread the code.
if (atomic_read(&svsk->sk_inuse) || test_bit(SK_BUSY, &svsk->sk_flags))
	continue;
This means: any socket where svsk->sk_inuse != 0 or SK_BUSY is set is ignored
by svc_age_temp_sockets: no attempt is made to close the svc.
This seems to be wrong: if svsk->sk_inuse is zero only if svc_delete_socket
has been called for it and will be deleted anyway (probably it is already
closed then).
But the intention of svc_age_temp_sockets is to close open temporary
sockets where no traffic has been received for more than 6 minutes. These
sockets have svsk->sk_inuse >= 1.
My patch does exactly this:
instead of
"skip sockets which are not already deleted or which are busy"
to
"skip sockets which are already deleted or which are busy"

Then svc_tcp_accept would be wrong, too (it closes sockets the same way just
without testing for sk_inuse and SK_BUSY).
I think this works because as long as a socket is in sv_tempsocks or
sv_permsocks svsk->sk_inuse can never reach zero. As svc_age_temp_sockets locks
the list nobody can bring svsk->sk_inuse to zero as long as
svc_age_temp_sockets holds the lock. As svc_age_temp_sockets calls
atomic_inc(&svsk->sk_inuse) when holding the lock there is no
problem. (the same is true for svc_tcp_accept).
This is the reason why I doubt that this check for svsk->sk_inuse in
svc_age_temp_sockets is usefull at all. It should be always false.
