The reasons for this are often not inside the VM itself,
but are due to the constraints imposed on the VM.
For example, with many of the journaled filesystems there
is no way to know in advance how much IO needs to be done
to complete a writeout of one dirty page (and consequently,
how much memory needs to be allocated to complete this one
writeout).
Parts of the VM could be changed to reduce the pressure
somewhat, eg. limiting the number of IOs in flight, but
that will probably have performance consequences that may
not be acceptable to Andrew and Linus and never get merged.
