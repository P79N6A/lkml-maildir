There were serios problems with 3.0. I never tested 3.1.  I  believed
3.2  was OK, but I every now and then problems pop up that seem to be
compiler related. Never found time to investigate, though.

I just heard that gdb 5.2.1 shows some problems when built  with  gcc
3.2  as  sipped with RH-8.0, and the problem goes away when compiling
with 2.95.[34]. The information might be wrong  or  a  misinterpreta-
tion, but I'm still suspicious.
