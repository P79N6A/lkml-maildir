Hi Andrew,
I found one more accounting inconsistency with dio_pages_in_io.
This is a day-one bug and I started hitting it on latest -mm
due to the recent changes to dio_pages_in_io calculations to be
exact.
If the file is badly fragmented (no contiguous blocks at all),
and the user buffer is not page aligned - we need to create
IO for each disk block with 2 pages. (bio with 2 vecs).
dio_bio_add_page() should not decrement dio_pages_in_io for every
add page. It should only decrement, it only if its done with that
page and moving on to next page. (since dio_pages_in_io represent 
how many actual pages we are operating on). 
Here is the patch to fix this accounting. Without this patch, we
will hit BUG() in dio_new_bio() with O_DIRECT on filesystems,.
Thanks,
Badari
