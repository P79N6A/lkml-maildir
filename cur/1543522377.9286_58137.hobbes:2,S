The present telephony framework in 2.2.14 (though clearly in its infancy)
seems to only deal with a narrow class of requirements - simple
telephony cards, acting as little more than channel by channel telephone line
interfaces. It doesn't seem to provide well for more powerful CTI cards, which
keep much of the audio activity on a mezzanine switching fabric bus (MVIP,
SCBUS or S.100). My question is, what are the real intentions of this
framework?
On other Unixen (and the Non-functional Telephony platform) every CTI vendor
has their own interfaces (someone say "TAPI". I need a good laugh). With
nothing to apply suitable pressure they are going to do the same on Linux,
when they finally wake up and get serious about it. Some vendors (e.g. Pika
and NMS) have had beta drivers for months, with little progress. It is unclear
what their real intentions are. Dialogic looks like it is about to enter the
frey, with more beta drivers. Again its intentions are unclear, but I'm damned
certain a core intention is to keep everything as proprietary as possible.
A strong framework being pushed from within Linux development itself might
mitigate this somewhat. Anyone have any thoughts on this?
