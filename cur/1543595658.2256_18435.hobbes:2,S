Looks, ppc64 is really still experimental right?  Which means it is
2.5.x material, and 2.5.x has been quoted as being a week or two away.
So we can solve this problem for real, with system bus domains, and
get ppc64 working all within the framework of 2.5.x which is just
around the corner.
For now, I am rather sure your systems for testing have < 256 physical
PCI busses and you can for 2.4.x use the remapping scheme sparc64 uses.
