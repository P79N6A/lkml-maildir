Hi
I just had to compile kernel for zipslack for 386 because
it's default has some problem with *WP
I chose linux-2.4.27 tree.
Sure i did it on other machine:
processor       : 0
vendor_id       : AuthenticAMD
cpu family      : 5
model           : 6
model name      : AMD-K6tm w/ multimedia extensions
stepping        : 2
flags           : fpu vme de pse tsc msr mce cx8 mmx
I did
make mrproper && make menuconfig && \
make dep && make bzImage
selected 386 and several other options as you
can see in .config which can be obtained from
http://portal.promon.cz/ledvinka/i/tscerr/config
All changes were done entirely via menuconfig.
Result of booting up the kernel is:
CPU: 386
Kernel panic: Kernel compiled for Pentium+, requires TSC feature!
In idle task  - not syncing
So i guess i just have to comment out
CONFIG_X86_TSC
that will be my first try.
Do not  i have switch it for:
CONFIG_X86_TSC_DISABLE
Sounds like it is option for kernel
not to use TSC although it's present?
Please CC me. Words comment out OR switch should be enough ;-)
