Nitpick: 
[kai@chaos linux-2.5.make]$ make bzImage && ls bzImage
[..]
ls: bzImage: No such file or directory
So you that bzImage isn't a real target (arch/i386/boot/bzImage would be).

Well, let's say I agree that the kind of semantics change regarding 
building modules at the same time isn't the nicest. So I propose the 
following:
make bzImage -> compile built-in, build bzImage
make modules -> compile modules
make bzImage modules -> build bzImage + modules (I found a way to do so
                        without having to descend twice)
make,
make all     -> compile vmlinux + modules as a general default,
                on i386 build bzImage + modules.
	        (other archs can change the behavior as they wish)

Let me second this. In particular, there is no way to reliably generate
module versions when the affected files cannot even be preprocessed. So 
it's the right thing to error out. If someone dislikes that, they can
still turn MODVERSIONS of and proceed in their broken world.

I fear there won't be feedback unless it is made default, since nobody 
even notices otherwise.
Anyway, before making it default, I'm planning to call gcc from the 
topdir, so error/warning messages get prefixed with the complete
path to the source, which will allow a smart editor to automatically
jump to the place where the message occured.
(Currently it works due to make's 'Entering directory [...]' messages,
 which are disabled in quiet mode)
