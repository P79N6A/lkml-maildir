Thanks for the pointer, Chris.
I'll see if I can figure out a way to make that useable for musicians.
The ulimit approach is way too cumbersome.
The pam_limits solution is not well-documented on my Debian system,
which doesn't even have a man page for /etc/security/limits.conf,
though the file has comments, now that I know where to look.  PAM is
powerful and flexible, but "easy to use" is not a phrase that comes
readily to mind.  :-)
The PAM approach would probably be workable for special-purpose audio
distributions like Planet CCRMA or DeMuDi.  That still leaves all the
audio developers with a significant challenge trying to explain every
configuration step to all our other users.  AFAICT, PAM configuration
is rather distribution-specific, so that could become a significant
burden.
It appears that a limits.conf line like this might work...
@audio - memlock 10000        # is there any way to say "unlimited"?
I'll experiment tomorrow to see if I can actually make this work.
