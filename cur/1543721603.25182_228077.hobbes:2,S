For example:
Just bop over to the Sandisk website, go the the OEM section, and download
the manual/datasheet for CF devices.  The wearlevel command itself isn't
supported (I'm ignorant of flash on IDE, I assume it is intended to mean
full scrub-style wear levelling) but they note they roll simplified wear 
levelling
into the erased page pool.
Doing that is an easy way to get part of the way there without needing a 
lot of
infrastructure.  And for the fill-read-empty usage model it's perfectly 
fine.
