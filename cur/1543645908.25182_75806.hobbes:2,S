Oh, well, if that one is really fixed, then I have another one. ;)
After some time up, few select & few inserts, Oracle decided to die
(2.5.40 + Hugh's patch, SMP, Oracle 9.0.1.4 - works flawlessly on
2.4.19). I have a full coredump, but I don't know what to do with it
(if somebody wants it, just say). It seems benchmarking will
wait... :(
