The patch-set itself actually looks fine, as far as I'm concerned.
But it does seem to have that "enable everything in one go" problem.
I'd much rather see one time source at a time being converted, and enabled 
then and there, so that when people report problems and do a bisection, if 
it was HPET that broke, you get the commit that changed HPET.
As it is, looking at that set, it *looks* like you'd get the "ok, now 
enable it all" as the commit that breaks, which tells you hardly anything, 
since the commit that _shows_ the behaviour has absolutely nothing to do 
with the code that actually causes it.
But yeah, the patch series per se doesn't look bad. If it wasn't for me 
being burnt by the last big switch-over for timers, I probably wouldn't 
mind it at all, personally.
