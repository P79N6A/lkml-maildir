Subject: 2.4.1-pre10 -> 2.4.1 klogd at 100% CPU ; 2.4.0 OK

I've been trying different 2.4.1-pre kernels trying to find one that 
doesn't end up with klogd pegging the CPU.  2.4.0 is OK, but 
2.4.1-pre10 to 2.4.1 all leave klogd sitting at 100% CPU.
The machine in question is a Gateway E-3200, a basic PIII-500 running RH 
7.0 with all the latest updates as well as the recommended updates 
documented in the Changes file.  The kernel is compiled with kgcc 
(egcs-1.1.2).
Below is the output from various files to hopefully give some hits as to 
what may be the problem:
