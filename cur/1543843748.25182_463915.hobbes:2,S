The problem is, the patch is basically s/bool/tristate/ so you can't
really count on /proc/config.gz anyway.  It's a lot like security
through obscurity.

Not a bad idea, but I think you want to be able to edit your config
before compiling modules.  In particular, you might want to turn
something from off to module.
How about we embed the md5sum of the config in the kernel, make it
available via /proc or /sysfs and then have /proc/config.gz return an
error in the event the md5sum doesn't match?
