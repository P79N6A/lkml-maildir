How about the patch below instead?  It's a bit easier to use, in that it 
doesn't require users to know about a new parameter.  Also it retries at 
1-second intervals for up to 5 seconds, which makes it a little more 
flexible.  If this works for you, I'll submit it for inclusion in the 
official kernel.
