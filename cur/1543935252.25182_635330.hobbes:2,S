I've added pm_sleep_start_end_mtx and the locking dance in
device_pm_destroy_suspended() specifically to prevent this from happening.

It may also be called by one of the CPU hotplug notifiers.

No, it doesn't as of the $subject patch (the list_empty() tests should help).

Yes, we can.

Okay, well, now I'm leaning towards the asynchronous approach.
I'll prepare a new patch and send it later today.
Thanks,
