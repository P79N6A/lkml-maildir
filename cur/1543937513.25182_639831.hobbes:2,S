Err... I managed to do it for thinkpad-acpi's merge tree too, a lot of time
ago.  So it was somehow possible to get it through the anonymous git server,
probably through the tag.  What I do know is that I usually send head's up
email when I notice something like this, and I find it strange that you
didn't get one from me at that time... but I may have forgotten to send it
at that time.
