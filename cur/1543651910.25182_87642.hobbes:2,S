Actually if they are exactly the same, why dont you just copy the
relevant files over? ie. /lib/modules/`uname -r`/*, and as mentioned
your bzImage, System.map, and lilo.conf (and of course remember to run
lilo)?
Any particular reasons why you would want to go through the process of
compiling again on each machine?
