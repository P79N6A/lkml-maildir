Subject: VFS Kernel Panic in 2.4.0-10(11)

This is probably a configuration mismatch of some kind, but I just
finished building my 2.4.0 RPM skeletons and am installting them from
our latest CD burn, and I am seeing the following 
problem when I upgrade our 2.2.17 kernel versions with 2.4.0-test10,
then reboot them under 2.4:
request_module[block-major-3]:  Root fs not mounted
VFS cannot open root device "301" or 03:01
Please append a correct "root=" boot option 
Kernel panic: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on 03:01.
The system was running Ute-Linux under 2.2.17 then was upgraded to
2.4.0-10 (with IPVS and pre-11 patches).
The disk is a 20GB device with 
/dev/hda1        Linux     (/,/boot)                               at
3,1
/dev/hda2        Extended  (contains a swap partition /dev/hda5)   at
3,2
/dev/hda3        Linux     (/usr)                                  at
3,3
/dev/hda4        Linux     (/archive)                              at
3,4
/dev/hda5        Swap       Swap                                   at
3,5
Lilo is configured in linear mode.  The device it's complaining about is
present 
(03:01) and lilo does append a root=/dev/hda1 statement.
Any ideas?
Jeff
