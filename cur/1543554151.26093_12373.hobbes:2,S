let's say the first line happens n ticks before the wrap and the second,
m ticks afterwards.

expire = timeout + 2^32/2^64 - n = timeout - n

timeout = expire - m = timeout - n - m = timeout - (n+m)
(n+m) is the time that actually passed while we were asleep, and timeout
has the correct value (timeout - ticks that happened)>
