From 10,000 feet out I have one comment.  If the VM has safe points. It sounds
like the problem is more that the safepoints don't provide the register
dumps more than anything else.
They are talking about an incremental GC routine so it does not need to stop
all threads simultaneously.  Threads only need to be stopped when the GC is gather
a root set.  This is what the safe points are for right?  And it does
not need to be 100% accurate in finding all of the garbage.  The
collector just needs to not make mistakes in the other direction.
I fail to see why:
/* This is a safe point ... */
if (needs to be suspended) {
        save_all_registers_on_the_stack()
        flag_gc_thread()
        wait_until_gc_thread_has_what_it_needs()
}
Needs kernel support.
