Hi,
Andreas is right. If you're compromized, You should reinstall your
system.
We catched an atacker at work not long ago. They hadn't the time to
remove their cracking tools, so we were able to analyze them.
This led me to the conclusion not to use a standard distro ( amongst
other things ). The script they used analyzed which distro is in use,
and infected the apropriate places for all popular distributions.
Furtheron I wrote a module to bastillize the box, using exactly the
methods crackers are using ( an example is on phrack ). Oh ... yes, and
last but not least we modified some userspace progs and the kernel (
this task took me to this list ), and we have everything read-only ( tmp
and var on a fs mounted noexec,nosuid,nodev ).
Regards
Frank
BTW: Can anyone point me to a site on which I can find some info about
the usage ot the crypto patches?
