I simply wasn't aware of dependencies on the hierarchy re-ordering
done inside menu_finalize() within choices, which is what broke this.
And I'm not convinced this hierarchy re-ordering is even fully
consistent in its current shape (i.e. it just happens to work for the
few cases it really is used in).

But nevertheless there are CONFIG_USB_GADGET_* dependencies in
sources. But in a draft re-write of that Kconfig I found an easy way to
keep these anyway, so the point isn't a concern to me anymore.

So I'll keep it that way.

Why not make the whole thing depend on EMBEDDED then? Or is
development for this perhaps being done in non-embedded
environments?
Thanks for the clarification in any case, now I just needs Roman's
opinion on the re-ordering issue in order to come up with a revised
patch.
