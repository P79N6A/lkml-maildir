IANAL, but I've talked to lawyers about clauses like this with
employment. Most of these clauses are too restrictive and are not
enforcible. But I've never heard of a non-compete clause to USE a
product. Only if you work on something.  I'll have to have another talk
with my lawyer, but I am pretty sure that you can't prevent someone from
employment just because they used a product.  I can understand if you
were employed by bitmover, or signed an NDA to look at the code. But
just the act of using it is ridicules.  Can you see Ford Motors telling
someone that you can't go work for GM if you drive a Ford?
FYI,
 What my lawyer told me about non-compete clauses (in the work place),
was that if they prevent you from getting employment in your skill set,
and your only other choice is basically to flip burgers, then they are
not enforcible (this is in respect to the USA, void where prohibited).
