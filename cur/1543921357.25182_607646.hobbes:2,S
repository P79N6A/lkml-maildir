Agreed.
So, I will add synchronize_irq() to both saa7134, and dmfe, the two drivers that their .suspend/.resume 
routines were written by me.
I already added a synchronize_irq()  plus few more fixes to the driver , but those patches are still in v4l tree.
I now has this:
	saa_writel(SAA7134_IRQ1, 0);
	saa_writel(SAA7134_IRQ2, 0);
	saa_writel(SAA7134_MAIN_CTRL, 0);
	synchronize_irq(pci_dev->irq);
	dev->insuspend = 1;
and I will probably need (with the synchronize_irq patch applied)
	/* Disable interrupts, DMA, and rest of the chip*/
	saa_writel(SAA7134_IRQ1, 0);
	saa_writel(SAA7134_IRQ2, 0);
	saa_writel(SAA7134_MAIN_CTRL, 0);
	
	dev->insuspend = 1;
	synchronize_irq(pci_dev->irq);
	/* ACK pending interrupts just in case*/
	saa_writel(SAA7134_IRQ_REPORT,saa_readl(SAA7134_IRQ_REPORT));
	......
This should be bullet-proof.
