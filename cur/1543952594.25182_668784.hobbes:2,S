Oh.
I doubt if a userspace implementation would even try to alter the ELF
files, really - there seems to be no point in it.   This is just complexity
which was added by trying to do it in the kernel.

It's not complex at all.  Pass a null-terminated pathname to the server and
keep running.  The server will asynchronously read your pages for you.
That's assuming executable+unreadable libraries and binaries actually need
to be handled.  If not: no server needed.

There is no complexity here.
