Of course it is an opportunity for a DoS.
Send to a closed socket; you dont send back a RST; aha! you are trying to
be a smartass .. i flood your logs with spoofed addresses (now that i know
you are logging them). And if you are not logging them your patch is
useless (because queso or nmap can still detect who you are).
Yes there are many ways to flood the logs but you are adding an extra one.
I kinda liked your solution; maybe you shouldnt have advertised it ;-> 
cheers,
