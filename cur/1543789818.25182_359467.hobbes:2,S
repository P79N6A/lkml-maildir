It just represents pages are physically hotpluggable or not.

The range which contains kernel data isn't hot-pluggable.
So such range shouldn't contain the kernel pages.
As you say, it's very helpful to show how section is used.
But I think showing hotpluggable-or-not looks enough.(KERN mem is not hotpluggable)
Once a section turned to be KERN section, it's never be USER section, I think.

yes.
But 'search and find on demand' approach  is not good for the system admin
who makes system resizing plan.
Do you consider some guarantees to keep quantity or location of not-hottpluggable
memory section ?
