About the latest "Massive e2fs corruption with 2.2.9/10":
I have the same probs on uniprocessor but *NOT* on SMP-kernel
SMP PII 266, Asus P2L97-ds, 128MB
---------------------------------
2 (130Mb) swap partitions on different hds 
Adaptec AIC-7880 Ultra SCSI host adapter Ultra Wide Controller onboard
some uw-hds
Linux version 2.2.9 (root@blabla) (gcc version 2.7.2.1) #2 SMP Sun Jun 6
21:54:33 MEST 1999
this box works great with 2.2.9/10, I can cp/cmp/bonnie tons of gigas
without a problem.
P233, Asus tx97, 128Mb
----------------------
2 (130Mb) swap partitions on different hds 
Adaptec AHA-294X Ultra2 SCSI host adapter Ultra-2 LVD/SE Wide Controller
some u2w-hds
Linux version 2.2.10 (root@blablaba) (gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314
(egcs-1.1.2 release)) #2 Mon Jun 21 12:49:19 MEST 1999
added "SCpnt->cmd_len = 0;" to the drivers/scsi/sd.c 
it get sometimes the following kernel messages:
08:12: rw=0, want=1664051300, limit=3076447
attempt to access beyond end of device
08:12: rw=0, want=1664051300, limit=3076447
And it is not directly reproducible
file1=50Mb
when I "cp mountpoint1/file1 /mountpoint2/"; cmp -l mountpoint1/file1
/mountpoint2/file1
it works 
BUT: 
when I run more cp processes:
"cp mountpoint1/file1 /mountpoint2/" &
"cp mountpoint1/file1 /mountpoint3/" &
"cp mountpoint1/file1 /mountpoint4/" &
I often get "08:12: rw=0, want=1664051300, limit=3076447 attempt to
access beyond end of device"
and sometimes it works.
With files smaller than 10Mb there aren't any probs.
Could it be:
- a buffer problem?
- something about the changes with cache handling? page cache instead of
buffer cache since 2.2.7?
- something with "egcs-1.1.2 release"
What should I do?
- downgrading to 2.2.6 or 2.2.5?
- which kernel is more stable?
