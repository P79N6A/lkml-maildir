Now it is...  FWIW, I suspect that absolute majority of asm/irq.h
uses can be removed now.
Next steps in irq.h/interrupt.h cleanups:
	* scouring asm/irq.h like it had been done for sparc32;
the parts that are only used by relevant arch/ code should be
taken there and includes _in_ asm/irq.h trimmed to minimum
	* separating tasklet.h, with interrupt.h still including it.
Using it where needed.
	* asm/softirq.h (with stuff mostly taken there from asm/hardirq.h)
and linux/softirq.h; again interrupt.h still should include it.
	* mechanical adding include of linux/interrupt.h to files that use
request_irq/free_irq/enable_irq/disable_irq/irqreturn_t/IRQF_...
---> in the next merge window:
	* replace include of linux/interrupt.h in netdevice.h with
that of linux/softirq.h.
	* trim uses of linux/interrupt.h that are not needed anymore.
