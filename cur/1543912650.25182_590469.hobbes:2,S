no.  it's not.  end of discussion.  you're wrong.
the concept of "maturity level" reflects where in the life cycle some
feature is.  it will typically start as "bleeding edge" or
"experimental" or something like that, eventually stabilize to be
normal (which would be the obvious default), after which, when its
value starts to run out and it begins showing its age, it becomes
"deprecated" and eventually "obsolete"  it's a natural and obvious
progression.
on the other hand, a feature can be "broken" at *any* point in that
life cycle -- that's why it is absolutely *not* a maturity level.
please don't fight with me on this, jeff.  you're simply wrong.

you have this so backwards, i can't begin to think how to explain it
to you.
