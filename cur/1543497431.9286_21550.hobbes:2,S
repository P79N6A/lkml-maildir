Subject: Kernel patch for terratec radio card

you can get my kernel patch at the following location:
ftp://tux.kawo2.rwth-aachen.de/radio/radio-terratec.diff.bz2
you can also find the datasheets for the chips on the card (the tuner
and the rds decoder) in this directory.
The patch was made against kernel version 2.2.9-ac1.
It compiles fine, although i was not able to get it to work, when
compiled non-modular.
There is a i2c controlled RDS decoder (Philips SAA 6588) onboard.
I would like to get this thing runnig, too. Can someone give me a hint
about where to start?
Thanks for all the answers to my first message!
Bye, Rolf!
