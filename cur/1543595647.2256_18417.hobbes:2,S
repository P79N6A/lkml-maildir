As Chris points out, allocating a signal by the scheme Jamie
describes is neccessary but not sufficient.  The problem Chris
ran into is that he allocated a signal fair and square, only to find
the application picking it up via sigwaitinfo()!
Yes, this is a bug in the application -- but it's interesting that this
bug only shows up when you try to integrate a new, well-behaved, library 
into the app.  It's a fragile part of the Unix API.  sigopen() is
a way for libraries to defend themselves against misuse of sigwaitinfo()
by big applications over which you have no control.
So sigopen() is a technological fix to a social problem, I guess.
