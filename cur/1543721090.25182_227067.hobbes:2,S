	Subject: Handle '/' in filenames in broken ISO9660 images
[Also applicable to 2.2.x]
There has been for some time a problem with certain CD-ROMs whose images were
generated using a particular tool on Acorn RISC OS. The problem is that in
certain catalogue entries, the extension separator character '/' (RISC OS
uses '.' and '/' the other way round) was not replaced with '.'; thus Linux
cannot properly parse this without this patch, thinking that it is a
directory separator.
