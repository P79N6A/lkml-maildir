Sparc64 has a similar PTE bit called "E" for "side-Effect".
And we also do the same thing as powerpc for framebuffers.
Note that on sparc64 in our asm/io.h PIO/MMIO accessor macros
we use physical addresses, so we don't have to map anything
in ioremap(), and use a special address space identifier on
the loads and stores that indicates "E" behavior is desired.
