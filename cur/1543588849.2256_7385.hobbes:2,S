Can you share a link to the "publicised potential problems" for DMA mode?
I'm running VIA686A using DMA mode and haven't had any problems.
However, the disk isn't operating as efficiently as I thought it would
(hdparm -t reports 16.3 MB/sec even though I'm using an 80w cable
with an ATA100 drive).  I believe that this is due in part to
corrective measures taken by RedHat to fix potential problems with
the VIA chipset; I saw it reported somewhere that the same configuration
will work 20+ MB/sec on distros like Debian).
