ARM would strictly need the flush as well.  I seem to vaguely remember,
however, that when this code went in there was some discussion about
this very topic, and it was decided that the flush was not critical.
Indeed, 2.4 seems to have the same logic concerning not flushing the
PTE:
        /* Don't look at this pte if it's been accessed recently. */
        if ((vma->vm_flags & VM_LOCKED) || ptep_test_and_clear_young(page_table)) {
                mark_page_accessed(page);
                return 0;
        }
