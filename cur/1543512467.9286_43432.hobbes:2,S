We could add a reference count to each vma protected by a per-mm spinlock.
Then we could drop the spinlock in swap_out_mm as soon as we incremented
the refcount of the vma. I am talking by memory, I am not sure if it can
be really done and if it's the right thing to do this time. (I'll check
the code ASAP).

All userspace allocations do exactly that.

We modify mmap in the mmap.c and infact we hold the semaphore there too.
The reason they are not separated is that during all the page fault path
you can't have _your_ vmas to change under you if another thread is
running munmap in parallel.

I can check them of course ;).
