Subject: 2.6.8 / 2.6.8.1 flaky for e1000 networking

Hi,
The following kernels seem flaky w.r.t their e1000 network behaviour
linux-2.6.8
linux-2.6.8.1
linux-2.6.8.1-mm1
(linux-2.6.8-gentoo)
No modules loaded.
All these kernels seem to download at 10-15 kBytes/sec and come to a
halt every 100 kBytes or so. Then I have to restart the download manually
or use "wget -c -T 1" to force quick auto-restarts for downloads. The
hardware doesn't die, just seems to give up temporarily and restarting
the process seems to restart the download over the NIC without any issues.
There's no NFS traffic at all in my switched environment, so I dont think
that's a issue with the 2.6.8 kernels.
I am using a Dell GX260, 2.0 GHz P4 with i810fb, e1000. Gentoo Linux 2004.2
linux-2.6.7 and linux-2.6.7-ck5 are very stable i.e. 150 kBytes/sec download
speeds.
I am not subscribed to the mailing list so I dont really know if you guys
have already addressed this issue. A brief googling didn't reveal a solution.
Anyways, let me know if you need additional info.
thanks,
