At least the way some networks are run this is incorrect. You've just
killed AX.25 support for networks that do assume the same callsign on a
different
frequency is a different connection. This should at least have a sysctl
to switch the behaviour. 
The whole notion of an AX.25 routing flap is mildly amusing given that
AX.25 isnt routed but is a link layer point to point protocol with a
broadcast datagram hack attached. I know people do it just like they
"route" netbeui but the default behaviour ought to reflect the AX.25
standard document and do the link layer checks.
