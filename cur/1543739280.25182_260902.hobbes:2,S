While my original post was more of a symbolic "I think you're being a
bit over-dramatic" response, it's still valid once it's in a tarball
too.  A tarball is just source that has the patch applied...
I personally don't see anything wrong with concept of signed modules. 
Make it a config option and call it good.  I'd probably never run with
signed modules with a kernel I built myself, but that's my choice. 
Others can choose differently.
Let's separate the technical details from the opinions about whether
such a feature will end the free world as we know it or not.  (Which it
won't).
