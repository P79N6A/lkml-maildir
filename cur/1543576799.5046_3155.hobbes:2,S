Ok. Since it's a new category, there's no maintainers for it. I'll post the patch here. 
And since it's quite a bit patch (about 120Kb) you can download the plain text patch at
this URL: 
http://www.ifrance.com/nobis/em8300-patch.
This patch is against the linux-2.4.0-test13-pre5 source tree.
Description: this is the integration of the em8300 driver available at
 
http://dxr3.sourceforge.net
The primary driver is only an external source driver. So I decided to try to build it
directly into the kernel source tree (there was incompatibilities with the new
Makefile system) and to add a devfs support for the devices. As it is a new category,
I've added a submenu to the configuration system: MPEG cards into the Multimedia
section. Please note I didn't wrote this driver but simply integrated an existing
driver.
