Ah, Fedora has this horror in its initscripts (which explains why I missed
it in my grep)..
# Initialize ACPI bits
if [ -d /proc/acpi ]; then
    for module in /lib/modules/$unamer/kernel/drivers/acpi/* ; do
        module=${module##*/}
        module=${module%.ko}
        modprobe $module >/dev/null 2>&1
    done
fi
This is there because there's no clean way for userspace to know whether
to load the system specific stuff right now.   Bill Nottingham pointed
out that we could add a /sys/class/dmi/modalias and appropriate MODULE_DMI
tags to the various modules like asus_acpi to make udev autoload them.
