Since I sit next to marcelo in the office I guess I could
answer this question.
The reason not to do this is because maintaining a kernel
is a horrible amount of work already and marcelo is pretty
overloaded with all the patches everybody send him.
OTOH, if _you_ volunteer to keep an -ac like kernel yourself
so small fixes can be sent to marcelo in batches...
cheers,
Rik
