mplayer knows how to play to a framebuffer on the console without X.  So this 
is possible.  I have played a movie on my framebuffer before.  If mplayer can 
do it, splashy should be able to do it as well.  Use a native framebuffer if 
your card supports that or VESA if it doesn't.  This is definitely something 
that belongs in userspace, not in the kernel.
