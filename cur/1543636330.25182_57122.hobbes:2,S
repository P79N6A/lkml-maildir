That is not a problem with rmap per se, it's a result of not properly 
handling streaming IO.  I don't think you want to get bogged down in this 
detail at the moment, it will only distract from the real issues.  My 
recommendation is to just pretend for the time being that this is correct 
behaviour.
On the other hand, if updatedb is pushing you into swap, that's a bug.
