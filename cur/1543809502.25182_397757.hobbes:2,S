Thanks, this patch works fine for me and after disassembling it seems 
you've found exactly the place where the kernel Oops'ed for me in the 
forcedirectio case.
But even with this patch applied, I had a freeze in the 
non-forcedirectio case, although much later than usual.
There seems to be more than one bug.  :-(
I'm currently trying whether there are still any problems in the 
forcedirectio case, and I'll report back as soon as I am able to provide 
any additional information.
