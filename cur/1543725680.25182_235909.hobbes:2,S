You may have hit either the 2.4/2.6 xattr compatibility bug, or some other
xattr bug since fixed in the kernel.  I'd suggest using a 2.4.25 or
greater kernel if you want to access ext2/ext3 xattrs which were created
under 2.6.  2.4 kernels below this do not have 2.6 compatible xattrs for
ext2 and ext3.
