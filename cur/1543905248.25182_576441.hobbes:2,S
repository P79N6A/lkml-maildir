Sending out the code (and early enough, 48 hours /is/ early enough) *is*
the normal (and good) way to do exactly the communication you described
above, IMHO.

IMHO, what you're suggesting is: (1) not the way development normally
happens in Linux, and, (2) not the way it /should/ happen, either. If
there's something (subsystem, any code big or small) I think I can do
better or have an idea for, I /should/ be able to just hack on it a bit
and then send it out so everybody can comment on it. Why should I be
forced to dance/discuss around with some other people, when the faster
and more effective way would be just present the code/patch that I
have in my mind as an RFC?
See, Martin, in the end it's not about developer A vs developer B. It's
about making the kernel the best out there -- that's what the users want,
anyway. Yes, I fully understand (and have said so earlier myself) that
there's a very important "social" aspect to development on such projects,
but it's best if developer B understands that this is the way things do
(and should) happen and adapt to it. [ It's not like I've been around for
long, however, but the above is still my opinion, fwiw. ]
