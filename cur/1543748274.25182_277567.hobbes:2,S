The issue here is that the driver supports devices which can vary in 
features on the same processor.  An example is the gianfar driver for 
the 8540.  The driver supports the two TSEC devices, as well as the 
FEC.  In order to make the driver applicable to different processors 
with different device configurations, the driver needs to be agnostic 
about how many devices there are, and what features they have.  As 
such, defining constants does not solve the problem.
These things could be assigned statically at compile time, in the 
driver, but this means that every new processor will require adding 
#ifdefs to the driver, which will become progressively more difficult 
to maintain.
Anyway, I like the idea of using feature_call.  Are we sure, though, 
that it's not using a hammer for a screw?  I'm not very familiar with 
the function's intent.
