Hi Rajesh,
this will allow compilation with hugetlbfs, please review. thanks.
I just finished adapting the priotree to work on my -aa tree (on top of
anonvma and objrmap-core).
It compiles cleanly, next is to try to boot it, in a few hours I will
know more. If it's sort of stable I'll load it in my main desktop and
I'll release a new 2.6-aa with it.
The quality of the prio-tree code is excellent (so it was easy to adapt
to my anon-vma changes that cleanups the vma merging removing useless
locks etc..), thanks.
As soon as the thing works the three patches
(objrmap-core+anon-vma+prio-tree) are ready for inclusion into mainline.
really one could nitpick that anon-vma may need a prio tree too, but
pratically the beauty of anon-vma is that a prio tree is not needed and
in real life it performs a lot better than a find_vma for every mm
mapping the page.
btw, the truncate of hugetlbfs didn't serialize correctly against the
do_no_page page faults, that's fixed too.
