No you cannot make that claim. That would mean that you have to touch 
32 pages which is inferior.

Nothing can be proven except within a rigorously defined mathematical 
system but even there we are limited by such things as Russel's paradox.
Its obvious that this is right. And there has been significant work 
invested into retaining page table pages on i386, sparc64 and ia64 for 
exactly the specified. This patch does not change that at all for these 3 
arches. There is no doubt about the correctness of the approach here.

Ok great idea but what does this have to do with this patch? This patch 
simply generalizes something that has been there for ages.

Andrew, this is utter crap and unrelated to this work. The main thing here 
is to generalize something that various arches already do and to avoid the 
page struct handling collisions. You use pie-in-the-sky to argue against 
consolidating code and fixing up usage conflicts of the slab with arch 
code?
