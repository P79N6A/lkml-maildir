	I have more information about the problem with the
unexpected SIGIO in 2.2.15pre7 UP x86.
	After adding some debugging in the kernel I found that
send_sig_info() returns EPERM and send_sigio() fallbacks to
SIGIO delivery using "send_sig(SIGIO, p, 1);". I have stopped to
search the exact values used in the EPERM checking because I found
this posting from Alessandro Sala <a.sala@mclink.it> on 06-DEC-1999
with the subject:
"PROBLEM: Asynchronous I/O with realtime signals erroneously sends SIGIO".
http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9912_01/msg01206.html
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=94451812209885&w=2
	The problem is described very well and I think I have
the same one. send_sigio() must pass the perm checking in
send_sig_info(). I didn't checked the corresponding 2.3 code. This
is the reason for the SIGIO. The event is for the listening fd. I
didn't checked if SIGIO is received for the connected socket.
