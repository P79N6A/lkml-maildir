I see in the picture they have that they put the network connector in a
nonstandard place.
What is it shipping with instead?

Indeed, the 845/850/875/7205? are all .8/1.5v only.  It's been that way
for a number of years.  Wouldn't be surprised to find out other chipsets
are like that either, 3.3V is rather old.
Don't use a 3.3V card, this violates the chipset specs, and you're lucky
you didn't burn out the card and/or board.  ASUS puts a red warning led
on the motherboard.  I'm surprised your 3.3V card fit, most are keyed so
you can't put them in the wrong slot.
