'foo jiffies'?
It behaves like all the other time_(after|before) macros.  "Compare a
given time T against some other time X".
T is always the first argument to these macros, it's never the current
time.  This is consistent.
And jiffies, the X here, is a well-known global variable. :)
The banner comment above the macro group should have clarified the
misunderstanding, btw.
