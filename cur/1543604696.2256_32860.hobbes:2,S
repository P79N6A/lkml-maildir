Does not work if all the code that uses crc32 is in a module.  No
references from the main kernel so crc32 is not included by the linker.

???!  __initcall entries are executed in the order that they are linked
into the kernel.  The linkage order is controlled by the order that
Makefiles are processed during kbuild and by line order within each
Makefile.  There is definitely a priority order for __initcall code.
