Hi, now I can use the "mount -o loop /dev/fd0 /mnt" to
mount the loop device after I use mke2fs format the
/dev/fd0. But how can I test it? What are the
/dev/loop0,/dev/loop1.....,/dev/loop7 used for? Are
there any detailed informations about how to use the
loop device? I've read some souce code about the
loop.c file. But not fully understand. Can anyone give
me a hand on this. Thanks in advance.
