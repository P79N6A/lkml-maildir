Ah ok, I tested this with LC_CTYPE=de_DE.UTF-8, in this case wc has
to read the contents of the file. When a single-byte locale is used,
wc just does fstat64() to get the file size(which returns 0 for the file).

The above shows that at least the two-liner task_dumpable diff is applied.

Sorry for the different output, I should have made my tests safer against
system variants. It should have applied clean, maybe some white space issue
or so, I'll check it. shutdown didn't change? What does it on your system?
