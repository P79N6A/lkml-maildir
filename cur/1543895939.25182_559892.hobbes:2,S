I agree. However, the freedom to run modified software on hardware for which
one is not the person who gets to decide what software runs on that hardware
is not one of those freedoms.

Right.

Right.

Exactly. However, that right does not include the right to run the software
on any particular piece of hardware. It includes the right to get the source
code, redistribute it, modify it, and so on. It includes the right to run
the software on *ANY* hardware, so long as one is authorized to choose what
software runs on that hardware.

The right to run GPL'd software on some particular piece of hardware was
never a GPL right. That is an *authorization* decision, similar to who has
'root' access on a Linux box and can modify and install the kernel.
You keep conflating things like access to the source code and the legal
right to modify that source code with the authorization right to install
that modified kernel on some particular piece of hardware. The GPL was never
about how such authorization decisions are made.
If I make you a user of my laptop, do I have to let you install a modified
kernel? What if I even let you access the kernel source, so I have
distributed it to you.
The GPL was never, ever about such authorization decisions. They are
completely alien to both the wording and the spirit of the GPL.
