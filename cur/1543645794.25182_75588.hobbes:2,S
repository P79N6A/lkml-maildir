Hey, if you drive that part, I'll be very happy. 
I don't doubt you can fix up the block device handling quite nicely by 
now, but I worry about all the other crud, including how to make the 
interfaces be backwards-compatible etc, and making sure we convert 
correctly in all the right places.
The explicit dev_t<->kdev_t conversion has fixed only a subset of the
problems, and we still use dev_t as keys into things (ie we have this
notion that two different dev_t never map to the same "bdev *", for
example - which totally breaks aliases etc).
There's also all the user-level interfaces for dev_t, and the disk layout 
interfaces used by various filesystems.
We can easily make kdev_t be 32-bit, but without a 32-bit dev_t that 
doesn't help much.
