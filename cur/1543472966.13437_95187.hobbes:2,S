Which ideology is that, which you utterly reject but appreciate its
results? Is it hypocrisy? An ego trip is when someone calls a righteous
call for acknowledgement of contribution an ego trip, idiocy is when you
make an ideology out of it, and to (even implicitly) call every single
GNU / Linux developer who believes in free software a communist is plain
insane.
So please, don't tell people to shut up. Much less so in the name of
'the people of the world'.
