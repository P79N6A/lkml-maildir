In this case you might have grounds to enforce this restriction of the
network on the network controller itself, I suppose.
Not that you should disable the network controller entirely (this
would render the computer useless for many other purpose unrelated
with blocking connections to your network).
You could instead arrange for the network controller to send some
signal that enables the network to recognize that the device is
running certified software.
