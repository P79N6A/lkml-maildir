This behaviour is deliberate, although I wouldn't claim that a lot of
thought went into it.
If filemap_fdatawrite() returns an error, this might be due to some I/O
problem: dead disk, unplugged cable, etc.  Given the generally crappy
quality of the kernel's handling of such exceptions, there's a good chance
that the filemap_fdatawait() will get stuck in D state forever.
I don't know how useful that really is - probably not very.  Plus, yes, we
should wait on writeout after a -ENOSPC.
So hum, not sure.  My gut feeling is that anything which we can do to help
the kernel limp along after an I/O error is a good thing, hence the
don't-wait-after-EIO feature should remain.
