I think it should be nice if we substitute in the struct tcp_opt all the structs
related to the congestion control algorithms with a more generic one which could 
be initialized when the connection is open by reading just one sysctl which defines
the algorithm to be used. This could allow later even a user-space application to
set the congestion control it desires to use.

I perfectly agree.
