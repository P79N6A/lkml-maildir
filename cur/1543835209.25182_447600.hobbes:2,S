Looks good. :)
There is a NULL pointer problem with empty menus, item_cur is NULL and a 
select or exit will cause a segfault in item_set_selected().

Wasn't it working at some point?
Anyway, it doesn't has to be overly complex either, e.g. if you delay it 
to the next key event, it's fine too. The signal handler would just set a 
flag and when wgetch returns, the display is reinitialized.

I think the easiest would be to just ignore the first ESC, it matches the 
documented behaviour and e.g. mc has the same behaviour. The delay of the 
single ESC makes it a bit annoying/confusing to use, so that sticking to 
the double ESC is IMO safer.
I played with it a little and below is an example, which implements this 
behaviour for the menu window. 
bye, Roman
