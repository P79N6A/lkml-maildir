Looks reasonable from a first look.
Issues:
- Should use CONFIG_COMPAT, not x86-64 specific symbols
- Why can't you set URB_COMPAT transparently in the emulation
layer?  Then existing applications would hopefully work without
changes, right?
You may also want to preserve the __user casts, otherwise
Al Viro and other sparse users will be unhappy.
Thanks for attacking this long standing problem.
