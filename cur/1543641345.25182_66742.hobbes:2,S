Subject: [Patch 7/8] 2.4.20-pre4/ext3: Fix buffer alias problem
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Fix problem in data=journal mode where writeback could be left pending on a
journaled, deleted disk block.  If that block then gets reallocated, we can
end up with an alias in which the old data can be written back to disk over
the new.  Thanks to Neil Brown for spotting this and coming up with the
initial fix.
