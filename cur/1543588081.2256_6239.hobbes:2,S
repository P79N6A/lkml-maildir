And this specific functionality is?
I think this is not a worthwhile project at all.  The X tree, it's
assosciated protocols and APIs, are complicated enough as it is, and
the xfree86 project has some of the most talented and capable people
in this area.  It would be a step backwards to do things outside of
xfree86 development.
If the issue is that "things don't happen fast enough in the xfree86
tree", why not lend them a hand and submitting patches to them instead
of complaining?
