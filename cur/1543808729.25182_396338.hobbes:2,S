that sata_sil driver uses the cache line register to tune some FIFO
registers.

sata_sil is not capable of MWI so it does not call pci_set_mwi()
I looked at the config space on a PC and alpha before the sata_sil driver
is loaded and it is different.
I suspect on the PC the system bios or the card bios set up this register
during post.
The sata_sil driver may not be doing the correct thing, however it seems
reasonable to assume that the device is configured properly (by system
bios or kernel fixup) before the driver init code executes.
This seems the same behavior of ppc and sparc64 pci code as well.
