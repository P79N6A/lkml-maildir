Yes, unfortunately we lost raw scancode mode.
The kernel first tries to translate scancodes to keycodes,
and then, if you ask for scancodes, tries to translate back.
The first translation will fail when the table entry is undefined.
Now you'll see "atkbd.c: Unknown key ..." in the syslog.
The second translation may fail because the correspondence is not 1-1.
You can try to use setkeycodes (say, from kbd-1.12) to solve
the problem of undefined entries.
