Snigger, explorer does get pretty confused doesn't it ? 
It looks like the LFN file selector can't decide if it's LFN or SFN.
Anything that's 16bit is fine though.
It gets even better when one of the is a file and the other a directory
   "The folder was moved or removed"   :-)
I suppose if somebody does that we've got a choice between Windows getting
confused in this way or confusing windows by changing the short name of the
other file/directory.  Well, scandisk doesn't think that the name collision
is a problem so it must be a Windows bug in explorer :-)
