That makes the count 2:2.  I'll continue to follow the simple solution
for some time, but wouldn't like to have it included for now (or ever?)

All right, you are proposing hell.  I've tried to think through all
possibilities and was too scared to continue.  So limitation is that
cowlinks and hardlinks are mutually exclusive, which eliminated all
problems.
If you really want cowlinks and hardlinks to be intermixed freely, I'd
happily agree with you as soon as you can define the behaviour for all
possible cases in a simple document and none of them make me scared
again.  Show me that it is possible and makes sense.
