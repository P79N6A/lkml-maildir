That is NOT TRUE.  If the author's intent is that anyone who is using
a TV with a screen larger than 29" and with two chairs is a theatrical
performance, and so anyone with a large screen TV must ask permission
from the MPAA first and pay $$$ before they crack open a DVD, would
you think that they should be allowed to claim that watching a DVD
isn't fair use unless you obey their rules?
I thought not.

P.S.  For people who live in the US; write your congresscritters; the
MPAA wants to propose new legislation stating exactly this.
