OK, it works with git 99f9f3d49cbc7d944476f6fde53a77ec789ab2aa
(something after -rc4). I can echo something into
/sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm and the machine will wake up from suspend
to RAM.
However, a minor glitch remains:
$ echo 1181672013 > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
- suspend
- wait for wakeup
After wakeup:
$ cat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
2051656909
