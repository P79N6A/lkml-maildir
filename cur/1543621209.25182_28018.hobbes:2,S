Just in case people need a reminder, you would do this:
	bk clone bk://linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.4
	cd linux-2.4
	bk pull bk://ohdarn.net/linux-mjc
This means you use our bandwidth for the main clone and then only take
updates from Michael.
Michael, if you want to stash a mirror here, that's easy, take a look at
	
http://www.bitkeeper.com/Hosted.html
it should be pretty straight forward.
Cheers,
