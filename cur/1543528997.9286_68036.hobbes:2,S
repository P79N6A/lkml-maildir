Hi Werner,
Ok let's look at your example ....

>   bool CONFIG_PCI

>   ...
> "Network drivers"
>   if CONFIG_PCI ...
On the level of theory, this is a bad construct because nothing requires
the user to traverse the "Peripheral Buses" menu in order to enter the
"Network Drivers" menu.
And in practice, users report a lot of "I want to turn on Feature Y but
I can't figure out which Feature X enables it".

Sequential evaluation has more constraints than my weaker "tree based"
scoping constraints (which are a lot like the scope constraints in
a block structured language, by the way, so we already have lots
of experience with them).  So if there is a script that violates
sequential evaluation, then it's really bad, and I would agree with
you to fix all those.

That would help out with internationalization too.
