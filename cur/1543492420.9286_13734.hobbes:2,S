You didn't read my post very carefully.  Every process has 8k (2
consectutive pages on i386) of kernel memory allocated to it.  This is
where the task struct resides, and what is left over is used for the
stack while the processor is in kernel mode.  This has nothing to do
with the user mode stack, as the int $0x80 call (or any other interrupt)
switches %esp to the value that is saved in the TSS (which is part of
the task struct).
