Absolutly there are cases which will break if the alignment of
allocations arn't correct.  The key here is the free algorithm will now
correctly merge buddies at the physical alignement.  This allows the
boundries of the zones to be miss-aligned.  Partial pages simply have no
buddies at the nigher level and do not coalesce.  The warning is
checking for such a miss-alignment and now is no longer required.
