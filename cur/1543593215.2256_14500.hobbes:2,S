There is nothing that would bind USB to PCI architecturally.
OHCI and UHCI are PCI based, but that's just a matter of
implementation. I think that Alan was unwise at this point.
I know that some small Motorola parts (relatives of 860, perhaps)
do have USB controllers, but I have no idea if PCI is involved.

Those, unfortunately, do not exist. I was shopping for one
in vain for a long time. One formiddable difficulty is that
USB bandwidth is larger than ISA, so the only feasible way
to make a HC is to have all TD's in its onboard memory,
as in VGA.
In other follow-up Alan argued in favor of CONFIG_PCI for
a PCI-less machine. It may be a reasonable approach, for
instance JavaStation-1 has no PCI but requires CONFIG_PCI.
It adds a little of useless bloat, that I considered a
necessary evil in the abovementioned case.
