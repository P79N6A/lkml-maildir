Could an ADC card be treated as a ALSA sound card PCM device.
That card seems to have features very similar to a sound card.
Sample rate.
Variable gain.
Multi-channels.
ADC
DMA
I only suggest this, because it could result in a driver that is much 
easier to implement as ALSA supplies a lot of generalised support code 
at the kernel level.
