It's one line per page. No sane app will make vmas proliferate.
So let's talk about the worst case.
pagemap's data set size is determined by VSZ.
4GB VSZ means 1M PFNs, hence 8MB pagemap data.
pmaps's data set size is bounded by RSS hence physical memory.
4GB RSS means up to 1M page ranges, hence ~20M pmaps data.
Not too bad :)

Python can do ioctl() :)
Anyway it's already a special interface.
