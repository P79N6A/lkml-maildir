is it a scsi tape? Is the tape always involved? there are st.c updates
between 2.4.21 to 22pre7. you can try to back them out.
If only the BKCVS would provide the tags in all files and not only in
the file ChangeSets it would be very easy again to extract all the st.c
updates. What happened to the BKCVS, why aren't the tags present in all
the files anymore? Is it a mistake or intentional?
You should also provide a SYSRQ+P/T of the hang or we can't debug it at
all.
