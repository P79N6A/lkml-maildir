Well, for such synchronous signals, it's a fairly stupid idea,
especially since you can't predict who will get it. Signals such as SEGV
are forced-in, which means they are force-unblocked. Thus, you can't
know for sure whome of signalfd or the target thread will get it first,
depending on who catches the siglock first I suppose. In one case,
you'll manage to steal it, in the other, you'll thread will be killed.
