Hmm. I could add that with
#ifdef ATOMIC64_INIT
atomic64
#else
atomic_t
#endif

Hmmm yes this could actually develop to be an issue for us. Columbia has
20 Terabytes of memory (some rumors have it that it get up to 500TB but
maybe that was just a journalist). But Columbia has only 1TB per 512
CPU cluster addressable directly. So even the biggest box in existence
right now will be fine with V19.
But V20 will definitely support atomic64.
