The UI lies grossly, but in this area I think you are right. (I'm still
unclear as to what happens to permissions when you copy something:
do the inherited parts change, or not?)

Yeah, I was being sloppy. You got what I meant. (In similar wise, file
permissions don't stop you from reading a file if you can coerce someone
else into opening it and passing you its fd. Nonetheless, file
permissions almost always *do* work.)

It'd still require changing POSIX and rewriting a large part of the
universe.

I don't think enough of it to do this is in there, at least not if you
aren't using something like NTFS.

Yes. But where? libc? (I can just see Ulrich going for *this*!)

... which means that either you lose per-process locale-dependence
via LANG et all, or you get the possibility of directories containing
several files with the same name from some users' POV.
Neither seems good to me; even though we already have part of this with
NTFS, we should not inflict it on people needlessly.

Well, they'd have to dump it into /proc/mounts, too (I guess that would
happen magically). That would unbreak the few things this cares about.

Indeed. I'm fairly sure this problem is trivially solvable: it's far
easier than the *other* problems lying in wait down the per-user-
namespace path. :)
