It was 2.5.68.
Thanks, that's very helpful.
msync(0) has always had behaviour consistent with the <=2.4.9 and
>=2.5.68 MS_ASYNC behaviour, is that right?
If so, programs may as well "#define MS_ASYNC 0" on Linux, to get well
defined and consistent behaviour.  It would be nice to change the
definition in libc to zero, but I don't think it's possible because
msync(MS_SYNC|MS_ASYNC) needs to fail.
