Thanks for running this test Adrian.

On this system ACPI is required to configure the IOAPIC.
It may be possible to save power in idle with c-states
and at run-time with p-states (cpufreq) on this box,
but I couldn't tell that from the dmesg if CONFIG_ACPI_PROCESSOR
was included or not.
If you don't care about interrupt performance and you don't
mind pressing the power button when you halt the system,
go ahead and run with CONFIG_ACPI=n.
