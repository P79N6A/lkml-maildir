Actually I had assumed that the optimized memcpy would bypass the
byte-swizzler.  If it _doesn't_ bypass the byte swizzler, then Dave
Miller's example actually works if all the data is aligned to boundaries
the same size as the unit copied through the byte swizzler, but then nothing
else does.

True.
