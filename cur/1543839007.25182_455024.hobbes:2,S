Subject: [PATCH] Fix docs for fs.suid_dumpable (#6145)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/17/468

Sergey Vlasov noticed that there is not kernel.suid_dumpable,
but fs.suid_dumpable.
How KERN_SETUID_DUMPABLE ended up in fs_table[]? Hell knows...
