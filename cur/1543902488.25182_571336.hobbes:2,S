there's one point i want to re-iterate.  i'd prefer to see
EXPERIMENTAL stop being a dependency, as in:
  depends on SNAFU && FUBAR && EXPERIMENTAL
"EXPERIMENTAL" is not a dependency in the true sense of the word -- it
is more of an attribute, and i think it would far more sense to see
entries like:
  depends on SNAFU && FUBAR
  maturity EXPERIMENTAL
sure, it's more work, but i think the cost is worth it in terms of
flexibility (particularly if *i'm* not the one doing the work. :-)
