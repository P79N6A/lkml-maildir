Subject: drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/: struct data_desc strangeness

drivers/net/wireless/rt2x00/rt2x00ring.h contains the following:
<--  snip  -->
...
/*
 * data_desc
 * Each data entry also contains a descriptor which is used by the
 * device to determine what should be done with the packet and
 * what the current status is.
 * This structure is greatly simplified, but the descriptors
 * are basically a list of little endian 32 bit values.
 * Make the array by default 1 word big, this will allow us
 * to use sizeof() correctly.
 */
struct data_desc {
        __le32 word[1];
};
...
/*
 * TX/RX Descriptor access functions.
 */
static inline void rt2x00_desc_read(struct data_desc *desc,
                                    const u8 word, u32 *value)
{
        *value = le32_to_cpu(desc->word[word]);
}
static inline void rt2x00_desc_write(struct data_desc *desc,
                                     const u8 word, const u32 value)
{
        desc->word[word] = cpu_to_le32(value);
}
...
<--  snip  -->
I haven't checked whether it might work in all cases, but passing 
non-zero values as second parameter to rt2x00_desc_{read,write}()
(as is done in many cases) is even in the best case bad coding style.
Spotted by the Coverity checker.
