The problem also is that the comparison here is between a SMP config for 
flatmem vs a NUMA config for sparsemem. There is additional overhead in 
the NUMA config. 
The effect may also be due to the system being able to place 
some pages in the same 2MB section as the memmap with flatmem. However, 
that is only feasable immeidately after bootup. In regular operations this 
should vanish.
Could you run your own test to verify?

I hope I have given some above. The number of the page allocator suggests 
that we have far too much fat in the allocation paths. IMHO reasonable 
numbers for an order-0 alloc should be ~100 cycles.
