Hi All,
We are submiting a new serial driver for the 2.6 kernel. This device 
driver is for the Digi Neo serial port adapter.
We made some changes based on great comments from linux community. We 
used the Russell's serial_core interface, handled all initilization of 
module correctly and used fs/seq_file.c interface for /proc entry.
I put the driver on our website:

Thank you very much!
