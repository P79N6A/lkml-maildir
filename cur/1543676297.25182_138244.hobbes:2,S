Subject: [2.5.70][PPC] Small change to config
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Since "control" and "platinum" display support doesn't compile if /dev/nvram suppor is selected as a module, here's this
small patch. The problem is that the suppor for /dev/nvram is asked after the "control" and "platinum" support...
Cheers,
	Daniele
