Hi!
I have an ASUS K7M mobo with via 686a chipset, my bios recognizes my hd
as udma4 capable, I have a dvd drive on the same ide channel as slave,
which is udma2 capable. Even if I give the kernel parameter: ide1=ata66,
(both drives are on the secondary channel) the hd switches back to udma3
mode, and by the dvd, dma is disabled, I have to switch it with hdparm.
Earlier kernels 2.4.4 and so, allowed me to switch to udma4 mode without
file corruption. So, I think, something must be done to correct the
driver problem. Any help appreciated. My current kernel is 2.4.17-rc2,
but the via driver has changed earlier, I think.
