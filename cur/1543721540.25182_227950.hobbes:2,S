my old comments for this are still valid, please add the actual dumping
methods directly to scsi_host_template instead of a pointer to another
method vector, please make it not a module of it's own but part of the
scsi code, please don't use "scsi.h" in new code, and the find gendisk
by dev_t code in sd.c is still no good.
