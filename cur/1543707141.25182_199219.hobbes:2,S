Just for your info, though. You can't even input these characters in a C
locale, since your libc (and/or xlib) is unable to handle them (lots of SO
C functions will barf on this one). C is 7 bit only.

The problem is that the very common C language makes it a pain to use
this in i18n programs. multibyte functions or iconv will no accept
these, so programs wanting to do what you are expecting to do need to
re-implement most if not all of the character handling of your typical
libc.
Yes, it's possible....

The "bit" is enourmous, as you can't use your libc for text processing
anymore.
Yes, it works in non-i18n programms, but right now most programs get
i18n support, which means they will all fail to properly handle
non-locale characters.
