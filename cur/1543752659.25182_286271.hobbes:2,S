I stand corrected then, you have access to much better sources than I do, no

They can still move faster when the vulnerability (and the fixed vendor
kernels) are released. The people who are to install the kernels usually
cannot act immediately, so if the bad guys have somebody on target, they
will root them anyway. I see no difference here to a model of totally open
disclosure list.

Again, it works for vendors, not for end users, IMO.

Theory is fine, practice is that the closed disclosure list changes matters
for a vaste minority of people - those who are to install the fixed kernels
are in perfectly the same situation they would be in if there was a fully
open disclosure list.
all of this is IMHO, of course - cannot stress that more :)
