This is not a bug.  Deleting a file is in effect a modification to the
directory containing the file, not to the file itself.  If the file
has a hard link in another directory, it will still remain there,
unmodified.  If you want only the owner of a file to be able to delete
it, set the sticky bit on the directory containing it, like this:
chmod 1777 /the/dir
This is commonly used on /tmp.  It is also the all Unix systems I've
been using work.
