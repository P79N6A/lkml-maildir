   Assuming your superblock got trashed, would it be possible to get at
   the backup if it were a file in the filesystem?
Yes, because I was assuming that mke2fs would arrange to place the
superblock at a fixed, known location.  The file in the filesystem was
merely simply the way to reserve the blocks necessary for the backup,
and to give a way for the user to reclaim those blocks if for some
reason they were so desparate for space they couldn't give up those
12-20k of backup blocks.
