Hi,
Problem:
My 802.11b "Ad-Hoc" net stopped working when going from 2.4.10-pre10 to -final
later I tested with 2.4.9-ac16, same problem.
The problem was really that the drivers (Prism-II) had been upgraded to handle
the standardized IBSS Ad-Hoc mode. But I had not upgraded my
bridge/router/firewall...
To force the old "demo mode" you can use the command:
> iwpriv ethX set_port3 1
But of cause it is better to upgrade to IBSS compliant mode.
Note:
 With earlier version of wireless tools the get_port3 always reported
 0 back to me... with the latest version 21 it works.
