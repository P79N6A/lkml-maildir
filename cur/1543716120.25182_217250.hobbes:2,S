Done and posted.  
The DBT3-pgsql test will fail on 2.4 at this time due to LVM2
and PostgreSQL interoperability issues with the 2.6 kernel.  We
have been focusing on the 2.6 kernel, so we have not had a chance to
get that test working on 2.4, but if anyone wants to fix it for 2.4,
we'll be more than happy to run it.
