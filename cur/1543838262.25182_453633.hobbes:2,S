This patch:
simplify-update_times-avoid-jiffies-jiffies_64-aliasing-problem.patch
makes my x86_64 SMP box (dual-core Athlon 64 on an ULi-based AsRock mobo) run
_very_ slow (it would take tens of minutes to boot the box if I were as
patient as to wait for that).
Strangely enough, on a non-SMP box I have tested it on it works just fine.
Greetings,
Rafael
