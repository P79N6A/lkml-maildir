Hi Jeff:
In IP100A, phy address is 0. Because IP100A is a single chip, the in
chip phy address is 0. so, we must search phy address for 0.

For IP100A, is the phy built into the chip?
For a standard DP83840[A] phy, phy #0 is a "ghost" which mirrors another
phy.  For this reason, we scan phy #0 last.
Does the above code not work?
