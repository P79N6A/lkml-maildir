The only thing that the PCI layer does for PM is the stuff that the 
driver would normally tell the PCI layer to do as part of a proper 
suspend/resume implementation: enable/disable the device and 
save/restore the PCI configuration space (only the standardized part, I 
believe). This is the bare minimum that's needed on all PCI devices, 
whether or not they even have a driver loaded. I suspect the number of 
PCI devices where this is truly all they need, i.e. no state in any IO 
ports or MMIO registers that need to be reset on resume, is quite low. 
Maybe in some cases it may appear to work by luck, i.e. the registers 
happening to be set to the correct values (especially on 
suspend-to-disk) but this is not a proper implementation.
