okay, I still wasn't able to find the documentation 
at the intel site, but I could extrapolate the issue
from your explanation (thanks by the way)
get_8254_timer_count() reads lo byte first, then the 
high byte, so assuming that the latch doesn't work
as expected on intel 430 NX and LX chipsets, can 
result in the following type of error:
counter >= 2^8 * N, 	LO is read (for example 0)
counter is decremented
counter <  2^8 * N  	HI is read (N - 1)
so the read value will be exactly 2^8 lower than
expected (assumed that the counter doesn't do more
than 256 counts between the two inb_p()s)
second the wrap-around will always happen _after_
the counter reached zero, so we can further assume
that the prev_count, has to be lower than 2^8, when
we observe a wraparound (otherwise we don't care)
let's further assume the counter does not decrement
more than 2^7 between two consecutive gets, then we
can change the wraparound check to something like
this:
        curr_count = get_8254_timer_count();
	do {
        	prev_count = curr_count;
	redo:
        	curr_count = get_8254_timer_count();
		/* workaround for broken Mercury/Neptune */
		if (prev_count - current_count >= 256)
	    		goto redo;
		/* ignore values far off from zero */
    		if (prev_count > 128)
	    		continue;
	} while (prev_count >= curr_count)
basically the check for (prev_count > 128) can be
removed but it feels a little more comfortable ...
would such change be acceptable for mainline?
TIA,
Herbert
