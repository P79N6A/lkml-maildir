Note that if you really want to add a qsort to the kernel you might as
well drop the setxattr sorting requirement too. If the kernel can qsort
for getxattr, then might as well do it for the case of setxattr too.

Precisely. Are there really any existing programs out there that are
using the raw xattr output and making assumptions about entry order?

So, I realize that the on-disk format is already defined, but looking at
routines like posix_acl_permission(), it looks like the only order the
kernel (at least) actually cares about is that of the "e_tag" field.
Unless I missed something, nothing there cares about the order of the
"e_id" fields.
Given that you only have 6 possible values there, it seems a shame in
hindsight that we didn't choose to just use a 6 bucket hashtable (the
value of e_id being the hash value), and leave the order of the e_id
fields undefined. 8-(
