This sounds exactly like the known bug, shared by 2.6.6 and 2.6.5, 
fixed in 2.6.7, described previously as occurring for UDF discs written 
to Linux from Windows:
ls works, but ls -l does not and cd does not.
> other session=x values fails to mount.
The dmesg for session=1 might interest us, but in any case, I vote we 
try reasonably current code e.g. 2.6.7 or a cvs fetch of UDF.

Excellent, now in theory I can try this myself.

In practice I am not yet a BitTorrent client, thanks for this clear 
invitation.

I hear 2.6.7 is by now old enough to have begun collecting known bugs.
