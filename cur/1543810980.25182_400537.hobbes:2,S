This is getting complicated that my little brain hurts.  There has been
so many iterations that the semantic is ambiguous.  If the semantic is
decided to be "overlap", then 
It will break arch/ia64/mm/hugetlbpage.c:hugetlb_free_pgd_range():
        if (is_hugepage_only_range(tlb->mm, floor, HPAGE_SIZE))
                floor = htlbpage_to_page(floor);
        if (is_hugepage_only_range(tlb->mm, ceiling, HPAGE_SIZE))
                ceiling = htlbpage_to_page(ceiling);
And it will break horribly bad because hugetlbpage_to_page does
"magic" address transformation.
