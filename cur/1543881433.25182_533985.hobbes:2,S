It was a simplicity trade off at the time, when AppArmor was mostly
aimed at servers, and there was no HAL or DBUS. Now it is definitely a
limitation that we are addressing. We are working on a mediation system
for what kind of IPC a confined process can do
http://forge.novell.com/pipermail/apparmor-dev/2007-April/000503.html
When our IPC mediation system is code instead of vapor, it will also
appear here for review. Meanwhile, AppArmor does not make IPC security
any worse, confined processes are still subject to the usual Linux IPC
restrictions. AppArmor actually makes the IPC situation somewhat more
secure than stock Linux, e.g. normal DBUS deployment can be controlled
through file access permissions. But we are not claiming AppArmor to be
an IPC security enhancement, yet.
The proposed set of patches is a self-contained access control system
for file system access, and we would like it reviewed as such. Current
AppArmor docs are quite explicit that AppArmor only mediates file access
and POSIX.1e capabilities.
