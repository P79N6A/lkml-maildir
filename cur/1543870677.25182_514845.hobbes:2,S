I knew that; but the task runs for more than 1 tick and it takes until the 
next calc_load run before it moves on even 1 tick.

With HZ=1000, the active count will be 1 up to 20 times in a row before it 
becomes out of sync with when the task is run again. This is ample time for 
the load value itself to get closer to 1:
$ uptime; (yes>/dev/null &); sleep 100; uptime
 20:00:29 up  4:35,  7 users,  load average: 0.33, 0.51, 0.78
 20:02:09 up  4:37,  7 users,  load average: 0.97, 0.67, 0.81
(not very useful results since the load isn't at 0.00 very often)

I still don't know why you think it may change the computation of load (aside 
from at boot or jiffies wrapping), and it's not really complex at all. It is 
possible that someone will change the value of LOAD_FREQ to something other 
than a multiple of HZ and this won't work because it'll get rounded up to a 
whole second. That and the negligible extra processing time of doing 
round_jiffies every 5 seconds is the only problem I can see.
I accidentally left LOAD_FREQ at 5 instead of 5*HZ and had a printk in there, 
it still worked fine aside from the load average going up and down every tick.
