Thanks for the report.  I think I've fixed the problem.  You had
to remove the following three patches:
  pnp-replace-pnp_resource_table-with-dynamically-allocated-resources.patch
  pnp-remove-ratelimit-on-add-resource-failures.patch
  pnp-dont-sort-by-type-in-sys-resources.patch
I'll post a new set of four patches (I added one patch to fix this
problem) to replace those.  They should go at the same point in the
series as the three you removed.
