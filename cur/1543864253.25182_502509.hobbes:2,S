My lock stat stuff shows dcache to a be a problem under -rt as well. It
is keyed off the same mechanism as lockdep. It's pretty heavily hit
under even normal loads relative to other kinds of lock overhead even
for casual file operations on a 2x system. I can't imagine how lousy
it's going to be under real load on a 8x or higher machine.
However, this pathc is -rt only and spinlock times are meaningless under
it because of preemptiblity.
