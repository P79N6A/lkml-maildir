Ok, it seems that ipw2200 is just a trigger for the problem here. AFAICT
the cause of the worse C state usage is that after ipw2200 has woken the
cpu, acpi_processor_idle() chooses C2 (due to dma? bm? I have no
idea...) as the prefered sleep state. Now without NO_HZ or when I hold
down a key, there are interrupts that wake up the CPU and when
acpi_processor_idle() is called again the promotion to C3/C4 happens.
But with NO_HZ, there are no such interrupts, most wakeups are caused by
ipw2200 and so the processor doesn't go any deeper than C2 most of the
time and thus wastes lots of power.
