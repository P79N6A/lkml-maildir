Subject: Problem compiling 2.3.99-pre1

I went to kernel.org, and retrieved 2.3.99-pre1.
I configured it, and went to compile and got the messages below.
When I disabled drm, everything compiled smoothly.  I checked newsflash and
the archives and didn't see anything like this.
I am running debian potato w/ libc 2.1.3 and gcc 2.95.2
Not that I actually need drm, but I was surprised to see it break the
compile.
Is this a known problem?
Thanks,
.Geoff
