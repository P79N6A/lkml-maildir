[describes how "mt tell" causes oops]
Yep, I can reproduce this bug.
Insert a tape, mt rewind, mt tell --> oops. This is bad
since is leaves the ftape driver in a "busy" state and
it even seems to leave the hardware (a Seagate TST3200R
on a CTC-2Mb fast controller in my case) in a useless state;
I have to power-cycle to get it back.
The problem appears to be that the driver isn't properly
initialized at this point: in particular the volume table
doesn't seem to have been read. First mt_tell() called
zft_find_volume() with zft_pos.seg_pos == -1: this -1
is promptly cast to unsigned which caused the first "<"
comparison in zft_find_volume() to fail. Second, "cur_vtbl"
is NULL, which caused the NULL ptr oops.
The proper fix would be ensure that the volume table has been
read at this point, but I don't really know where and how
this should be done. The patch below is a bandaid which cures
the immediate problem for me.
(ftape-4.02 has fixed this bug. I have a big patch which adds
ftape-4.02 to kernel 2.2.5 and fixes some bugs; contact me
if you want it.)
