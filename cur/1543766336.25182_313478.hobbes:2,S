That is exactly what my proposal does, except I'd make the normal tags 
creation always sign.
But since _git_ won't care which is why I want the signature at the _end_, 
not "surrpunding" the thing, you could create a tag that just doesn't have 
the signature, and git will never even notice. The people who see the tag 
may say "hmm, why couldn't he be bothered to sign it", though.
