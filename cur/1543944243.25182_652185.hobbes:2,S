Don't you just need a simple recursion counter for this? 
I cannot think of a reliable simple way to check for this using the instruction
pointer. The only way would be to use explicit annotations for all
possible code similar to what kprobes does (__kprobes), but that would be 
hugely intrusive all over the tree.
With the recursion counter the only problem would be someone 
setting a break point on the early notifier code itself that contains
a recursion check, but that would be only a few lines of code
so the risk of someone setting a break point exactly there would
be low.

I believe you, but I don't believe that your implementation
of this handles all cases.
