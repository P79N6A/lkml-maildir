Because the Xen drivers will run on a couple of architectures, including
IA64 and PPC.
If IA64 or PPC didn't implement at least wrappers for the sync ops
then they would all need special ifdefs to handle this.

It's a huge performance difference.

Ok it could be put into a separate file (although with a neutral name)
But you would still need to add that to IA64, PPC etc. too, so it 
would only avoid adding a single to the other architectures.
