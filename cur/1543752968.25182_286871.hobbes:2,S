Actually, there's no "correct" or good way to do that at all. Currently,
the system call number is used as an index to a pointer table on most
archs (with a bit of added complexity possibly because of supported
different APIs, eg. on MIPS).
However, that's not always true. For the VAX port, we've considered
having structs per syscall, not only a single pointer.
Also, adding syscalls somewhere won't lead to a stable API, so you may
run into problems off the user space...

For testing purposes, you'd add some dummy entry at the end and register
(through an exported function you've got to add to the core kernel) your
function pointer with it.
However, the basic question is: you you *really* need to have new
syscalls? Just right now, we've already got too many of 'em... So what's
the main goal you want to achieve with your software?

Seconded...
