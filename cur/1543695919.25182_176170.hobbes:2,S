I have had this idea, for a while, that with the continued fall in price
per bit of storage, and the fact, that back-up strategies are not
catching up and are perhaps falling behind, that maybe a new paradyne
for storage might be feasible soon.  The idea is that you have a
permanent store, using raid or raid-like redundancy and file versioning
so that nothing is ever deleted, you just keep adding drives and
replacing those that fail.  Of course you'd need some geographic
diversity and a way for storage to migrate to newer "file stores" to
really work, but just think, no more backups to fail...ever!
