As most know, recent gcc versions require -fno-strict-aliasing to be
passed to them in order to get a working kernel. As the 2.95 release
is nearing I'd like to add this to the gcc FAQ.
Now I only ever dealt with the intel side for which the place I'd
choose would be arch/i386/Makefile for up to 2.2.X and CFLAGS in
linux/Makefile beginning with 2.3.X. Is this correct ? And where would
it have to be put for other architectures ?
Getting this info into the gcc FAQ would most certainly cut down on
bug reports or at least provide for an easy place to point to. So any
help from you would be *very* welcome.
So thanks in advance
Philipp
