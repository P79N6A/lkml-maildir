OK, I kept thinking there was more to it ... I am not sure if loadkeys
program is always needed or not (depends on CONFIG), but I remember
seeing a binary loadkeys was used, so that may be an issue.  I am not
sure if newer versions of cygwin come with loadkeys or how easy it is to
build one for cygwin.  The other thing I remember was a missing elf.h
file on cygwin.  I think with
- loadkeys (not a kernel patch)
- missing elf.h (IIRC) (not a kernel patch)
- kconfig shared library patch (from Dan's link)
- and the patches sent earlier
some platforms should see a full build (for >= 2.6.4).  Sometimes there
are problems in arch/<xxx>/Makefile that you will see only if you build
for a particular board/platform, so there will always be a few lurking.

I can't easily do any testing for the next few days since I don't have a
setup right now, but might be able to sometime next week.
