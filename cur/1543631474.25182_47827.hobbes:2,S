Yup.  In fact, some declarations need to be moved out of
buffer_head.h.

This isn't buffer-specific; should be in mm.h or similar.

Should never be called - all callers should call
call a_ops->flushpage() (and rename it to
invalidatepage, for heavens sake)

well hopefully we can do something a little tidier than
all the invalidate_foo2() functions.  But that's in fact
a happens-to-not-matter bug. Should be using PagePrivate()
in invalidate_this_page2()

Sigh.  Needs to be pushed out to generic_file_write()
callers, I suspect.
