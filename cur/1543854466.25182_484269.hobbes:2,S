Could we reduce the migration pain by leaving the work_struct as-is and
defining a new, leaner one and then incrementally migrating stuff over to
it?
struct work_struct_lite {
	unsigned long pending;
	struct list_head entry;
	void (*func)(void *);
	void *data;
	void *wq_data;
};
struct work_struct {
	struct work_struct_lite w;
	struct timer_list timer;
}
or even
struct work_struct {
	union {
		struct work_struct_lite w;
		struct {
			unsigned long pending;
			struct list_head entry;
			void (*func)(void *);
			void *data;
			void *wq_data;
		};
	}
	struct timer_list timer;
};
