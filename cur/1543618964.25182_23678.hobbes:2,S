I'll speak up here as a subsystem maintainer and say that I'm happy with
the current situation.  I integrate a wide variety of USB driver patches
from lots of different people (and usually in lots of different formats
against different kernel trees) and feed them to Linus/Marcelo/Alan in
small chunks that can be easily applied against their latest kernel
version. 
Sure, sometimes my patches get dropped, but you forgot to mention the
most important thing a kernel programmer needs to have, persistence :)
thanks,
