Yes, of this I'm sure.

Total system throughput is fine, and as expected, the only difference is 
the modest overhead of paging heftily or lightly and/or not at all.  The 
realtime throughput difference between kernels is ~10 seconds... very 
definitely concurrency issue imvho.  And I agree 100% that this is not 
_necessarily_ a bad thing.  The time it takes for _any_ pressure to build 
looks decidedly bad though.  With the combo patch it does look better than 
earlier patches... sudden bursts of paging do not occurr, it's..... 
smoother once it starts acting something resembling normal.

The build is running in a small EXt2 partition.
