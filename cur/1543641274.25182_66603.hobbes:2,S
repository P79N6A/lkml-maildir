As we discussed earlier, I converted the PnP BIOS driver to the driver 
model  Please advice on any changes you would like.  I look forward to 
hearing from you.
Thanks,

The following are potential changes for future pnpbios patches listed in
order of priority.  Let me know if you support them.
1.) Add pnpbios specific interfaces to the driver model, this includes
resource management and escd.
2.) add pnpbios dev id list support, similiar to the devlist found in pci
3.) remove dependancy on struct pci_dev and create a pnpbios specific
dev structure
4.) split the pnpbios files into smaller more manageable files as well
as other cleanups
5.) port some drivers to use the pnpbios driver if available.  Should
this include the pci driver?
