I suppose you want ccache then. kbuild-2.5 may save two minutes of your
one hour build. The current kbuild's problem is not that it recompiles too
many files, but rather too few sometimes (in particular with modversions).
(And yes, ccache won't work too well if you move your trees around, since 
*both* build systems use absolute paths. That needs fixing)
