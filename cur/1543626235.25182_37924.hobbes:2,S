Is that to say an ac branch (which uses rmap) can do the 128 but is
non-responsive?   I sent a couple mails of my own preliminary runs and
the feel i got when running the test was absolutely no effect on
responsiveness even as the load hit 110.  Of course this is with riel's
preempt patch for 2.4.19-pre4-ac3.  I guess I'll try with threads = 256
just to see if this frozen feeling occurs in preempt kernels as well. 
You dont seem to test them anywhere on your own site.
