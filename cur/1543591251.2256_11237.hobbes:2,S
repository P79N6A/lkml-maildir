Subject: write() writes too many bytes?

OK, I know this is bizarre and probably some goof on my part, but it
is just too weird for me to guess at further:
My program write()s 2- and 4- byte chunks or data to a file (for a WAV
header). When the data being written contains an 0xff byte, it is
apparently written to disk as 2 bytes: 0x81ff.
