I know, but what I meant was con2fb_map[] is never initialized by fbcon.  So 
if the first valid fbdev is in registered_fb[1], then con2fbmap must be 
initialized to 1's by fbcon.  It doesn't.  Note, fbdev-2.4 does the 
initialization correctly.
So 2 critical flaws in the code:
1. con2fb_map[] is always zero-set
2. fbcon assumes that registered_fb[0] is always valid
Both flaws will manifest by doing this:
modprobe fbdev1 - in registered_fb[0]
modprobe fbdev2 - in registered_fb[1]
rmmod fbdev1      - registered_fb[0] becomes invalid
modprobe fbcon  
	 - con2fb_map[] with zeroes instead of 1's and fbcon_startup looks for 
fb_info in registered_fb[0] instead of registered_fb[1]
