Ah ...
Reading the MII in the driver is done while holding the driver lock, so
there could definitly be some interaction with the xmit. That was
suggested before, but I couldn't see how.
Or it could just be that if someone does mdio things at the wrong time the
chip gets "confused".

I for one would be interested in an isolated testcase of this failure, GPL
or otherwise, and see if I can trigger this on my machines.
