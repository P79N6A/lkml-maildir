   It really depends on what you mean by low cost?  The ony ide raid 
controller that does 8 PATA drives well under linux is the 3ware 
controller.  For SATA drives you have the 3ware, and adaptec controller. 
    In theroy the highpoint 8 port sata card would be a good canidate 
for software raid, but highpoint has yet to cough up an open source 
drive yet.
   It you want to go the software raid route and have 2 spare pci solts. 
  You can go with either the high point rocket raid 454 (PATA), or the 
promise SATA150 TX4.
   I really don't recommend any of promise's cards that use use the i2o 
driver, or any sort of binary only driver.
PS- Why not at least run software raid 5?  It takes far less cpu than 
you'd think, and can save your ass.
