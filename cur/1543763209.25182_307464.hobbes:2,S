Since 2.6.12-rc1-RT something I get this Oops on boot about 50% of the
time.  It's clearly some kind of race because if I just reboot again it
works.  Seems to happen shortly after ksoftirqd startup (maybe the first
time we hit the timer softirq?).
This is (lazily) hand copied and incomplete, but hopefully is enough
info...
