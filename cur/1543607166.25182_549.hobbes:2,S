   Well the thing is that I like todo evil things,
   like connecting sgi flatpanels to creator3d's, using
   non sun blessed ( aka sub 1000$ ) ethernet cards or
   sticking in wierd raid cards.
   Which is why I like linux ;)
   Having source is great because I can break it,
   and maybe learn something in the process.
All of this is irrelevant to going over the 3.5MB mark,
I contend that your machine simply does not need it no matter
what obscure stuff you stick into it :-)
Turn off the PCI device names, that is usually what eats up a
lot of space and lspci provides the same info anyways...
Franks a lot,
