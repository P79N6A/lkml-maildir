I'll think about this.  The "Linux development team" thing seems pretty
popular, so
iiiiit's back! =)

Done.

Absolutely right.  Fixed.

This may be a little confusing, since "its" may refer to "this release,"
which
hasn't been around long enough to have hallmarks. =)  Nonetheless, I'll
put it in
and see what other say.
> Still don't like "series of"! Are they in a sequence?  Who's first?
I was thinking of an unordered series, but I replaced it with "class."
Tell me what
you think.
> Drop "not limited to" (or use the required commas, dashes, whatnots).
Dropped.
> Drop "then". Semantics takes care of that.
Dropped, although it still sounds a bit awkward.

I think they're both correct, but yours sounds better.
> Provide one.
If it comes to that, I'll mirror it on my office computer and pray it
doesn't get
/.'ed.

Yeah, yeah, yeah... "offers" replaces "has."

Used a ;.
To save space, I am not including this in the email.  Please go to

and look at draft #4 for the latest revision.
