Hello,
I've noticed a bug in the fb system during boot.  (I'm running a
stock 2.6.4 kernel, with the newer of the two radeonfb drivers
compiled in statically.)  After the fb driver initializes, there
is _never_ a boot logo featuring star of stage and screen,
Mr. Christopher Walken.
Included below is a patch to fix this issue.  (gzip'd, ~24kb)
Thanks,
--Joey
