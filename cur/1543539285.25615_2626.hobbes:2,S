It happened to me lots of times with 2.4.0-test2, and a couple of
times with test4-pre, but not (yet) with the final test4.
Bloody annoying when it happens. I still don't know what causes
the bug -- where's the race in
	<unpack tarball>; <cp good .config>; make oldconfig;
	make dep; make modules bzImage
on UP and no "make -j"?
