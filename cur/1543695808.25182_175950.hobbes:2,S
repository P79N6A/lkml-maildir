I suppose it will show some improvement but fail to get performance
anywhere near 2.4 -- at least that's what my own tests found. I've been
working on a break-down of where we're losing it.
Bottom line: It's not simply a price we pay for feature X or Y. It's
all over the map, and thus no single patch can possibly fix it.
