It is true, 2.5.73 unconditionally detects and tries to use the Syn. Touchpad 
in 'absolute mode'. I wouldn't blame the authors of the module, however. They 
are already doing a great job :).
I 've read the code to see what's wrong and found that the problem is that the 
Touchpad itself doesn't report any data to the PS/2 port. The code still 
looks conforming to the specs.
However, you shouldn't give up 2.5.73 because of that. You can still use the 
PS/2 compatibility mode
 o Compile the ps mouse as a module "psmouse"
 o Arrange so that the module is loaded with the option "psmouse_noext=1"
 o Have gpm and X (you can even use both of them) read /dev/input/mice as an 
exps2 or imps2 mouse (Intellimouse Explorer PS/2) .
I don't think the "event interface" has any support yet. Nor the synaptics 
driver.
Reading from /dev/input/mice means that the psmouse module doesn't have to be 
loaded before X starts. You can safely rmmod/modprobe the module while X run.
You may find that tapping with the finger may not work (produce 'click' 
effect). I hope next release will have a fix (contact me in personal until 
the official patch is out).
