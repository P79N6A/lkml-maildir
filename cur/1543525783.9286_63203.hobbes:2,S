When I first looked at the filesystem code as a kernel-hacking newbie 
about a year code I was struck by the fact that the headers of every
filesystem are included in fs.h, seemingly just for the purpose of 
finding out the size of the filesystem-specific superblock and inode 
info.
The longer I work with this code the more I feel that the simple need
to calculate two union sizes is keeping the whole vfs from being properly 
factored.  According to my simple-minded way of looking at things, the 
vfs ought be compileable without depending on *any* of the files 
belonging to specific filesystems.
The current inverted arrangement forces all kinds of awkward tricks in the
header files - noteably having to define special symbols to keep headers
from being compiled more than once.  The order of header compilation winds 
up being much less than obvious.  Vfs is forced to know about every 
filesystem in the linux world and can't be compiled without compiling 
the headers of all of them, nor can any of the included filesystems be 
compiled safely without recompiling vfs.  In other words, vfs isn't yet
fully "virtual": it's tied by just two slender threads to filesystem
specifics.
This factoring problem can be fixed quite easily and elegantly I think.
My question is: does anybody besides me see this as something that needs 
fixing?  Is there some reason I don't know about for vfs to see the 
headers of every filesystem, and is there a philosophical reason for
things staying the way they are?
