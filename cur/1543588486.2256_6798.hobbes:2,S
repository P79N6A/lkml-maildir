No, I meant I tested this exact patch you wrote on my system and it
doesn't fix the Oops on boot problem. Maybe I forgot to recompile the
kernel while I tested it, but I doubt.

I'm happy to hear it works on your system, but I don't think we should
relay on link ordering in order to resolve dependency problems. More
generally, it's kinda dirty the way it works now in the kernel, where the
initialization order is determined by the linkage order.
