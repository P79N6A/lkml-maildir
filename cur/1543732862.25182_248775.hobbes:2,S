Ah, I didnt say adding an address to loopback would make everything 
use it. Merely that loopback already exists as an interface to which 
from which you can 'hang' your VIPA - no need for a new interface.
You could try:
 	ip route change default via <gateway> src <vipa>
Presuming the NFS clients are behind a gateway. If also onlink, you 
need to modify the connected routes and change the src there too.

It might even already exist.. who knows. ;)

Right, but Linux can already do it. The configuration might not be 
the same as AIX, but that's not a good reason.. if it were, you 
should also be porting smit to Linux to satisfy your customers ;)
Linux can already do what you want I think. Just a matter of 
configuring it.

Have you tried playing with ip route?
 	ip route <destination> ...... src <source address>
