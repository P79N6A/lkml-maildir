It seems that booting with "noapic" fixes it, or at least now it
is much more difficult to trigger.  Still testing...
Before upgrading to 2.4.21, I've been running 2.4.20 with APIC
enabled for a few months, and there were no such IDE errors.
BTW, "noapic" fixes the "power button not working if ACPI is alone
on its own IRQ" problem (present in both 2.4.20 and 2.4.21) too.
Thanks,
Marek
