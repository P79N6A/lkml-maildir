Heh, I think most of those files only show up if you have
CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG enabled, and it's easier to add them to the original
sysfs entries instead of creating new debugfs ones.

sysfs files have their dentries and inodes pushed out of memory if they
are never accessed, so no huge ammounts of memory are used here.
Otherwise we would never be able to support 20,000 block devices on a
31bit s390 with 128Mb of ram :)
