Well, debian is using an "ar" archive with tar.gz contents.

AFAIK cpio is quite common on SysV Systems. The Problem with cpio and tar is,
that there are many incompatible versions. Even the Posix.1 format is quite
limited (255 char path limit). Some others fail short with symlinks or block
device nodes.
AFAIK SUS is supporting the use of pax.
