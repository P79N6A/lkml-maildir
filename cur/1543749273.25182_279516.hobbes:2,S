It is the visor.[ch] of vmlinuz-2.6.9-1.681_FC3 that does not work.
I recompiled a linux-2.6.9 kernel and the pilot-xfer, dlpsh, and kpilot work
now.  It is the visor.[ch] in vmlinuz-2.6.9-1.681_FC3 that is the culprit.

You asked: What kernel version are you using?
vmlinuz-2.6.9-1.681_FC3,
but the original Fedora Core 3 did not work either.
It was suggested to remove the visor diffs from the ac10 patch and that would work.
I may try building linux-2.6.9 and see how that works.
