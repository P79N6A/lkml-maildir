So for $100 dollars you get a CPU, a network interface, and enough memory to 
run Linux?  Ok, that seems possible.
But I don't see why you would want to build that into a disk drive.  What do 
you do if a drive goes bad?  It would make more sense to have a little cage 
running all this stuff that you could hot plug regular drives into.  You could 
spend a little more money and build such a cage that holds a couple drives, 
then I think it would make perfect sense to run linux on the cage to give you 
cheap "mini" network servers.  I would imagine such devices could sell for 
around $150-200 for 2-4 drive capacities.  They could have a boot prom to 
netboot a kernel, and wouldn't really need much else.
