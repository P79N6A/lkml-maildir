try booting with "acpi_irq_isa=12"
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKB] (IRQs 3 4 5 6 7 12) *0, disabled.
ACPI: PCI Interrupt Link [LNKB] enabled at IRQ 12
There are 3 BIOS bugs here:
1. LNKB is marked disabled, yet referenced
Linux handes this
2. Current Setting for LNKB is not in possible setting list
Linux handles -- though apparently this fixes some systems
and breaks others.
3. IRQ12 marked as a viable IRQ for sharing sound and mouse
Linux falls for this hook, line, and sinker.
I'd be interested to see your dmesg and /proc/interrupts from 2.6.1
thanks,
