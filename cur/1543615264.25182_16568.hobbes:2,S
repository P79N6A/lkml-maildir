The double sync is tradition.  SysV init scripts should sync things,
but "sync;sync;reboot" or "sync;sync;halt" are not so nice in how
they go down; so it's a case of being extra careful.  I don't use
linux all the time, and some of the other unices are less tolerant.
(For example, on a sun box, I would prefer a double sync before I
"<stop>-a".)
