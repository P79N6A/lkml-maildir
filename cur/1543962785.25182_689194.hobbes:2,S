Are you familiar with the kernel command-line option slub_debug=FZPU ?
If this was not yet enabled, recompiling your kernel with
CONFIG_SLUB=y and CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG=y enabled and specifying
slub_debug=FZPU on the kernel command line will probably provide more
detailed information about the cause of the memory corruption.
