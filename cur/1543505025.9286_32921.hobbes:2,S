Hi Richard.

Most of these were obtained from socket.h specifically, in which I
have used the identifier provided. I chose to label these 'possible
identifier' because I have seen conflicting identifiers for some of
them in the past.
The ones I listed under the 'identifier' column are those defined on
the system I am currently using, plus ax25 which I use regularly at
home, and that is all that separates the two columns.

I deliberately omitted that one as it appears to have at least three
different names in the kernel sources, and I didn't plan on guessing
which was the correct one.

Quite possibly...
