No - but a structure which has other objects in it before the object
being written out may well be 2 byte aligned on M68K and some of the
other externally 16bit platforms - ditto local dynamic objects.
Why can't we just make the list one item longer than the entry count and
stick a NULL on the end of it like normal people ? Then you need one bit
which ought to be safe for everyone (and if the bit is a macro any CPU
warped enough to have byte alignment is surely going to have top bits
spare...)
