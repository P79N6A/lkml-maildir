Hi!
Two weeks ago, I tried two patches against 2.4.21 regarding LBA48
support. One limits the size of a drive to 137GB if LBA48 is not
available. Without this patch, severe data corruption is possible.

The other one is making LBA48 support work with pdc 20265 controllers.

I think they should be candidates for inclusion in 2.4.23, as well as
a fix for hdparm -I (and other commands going directly to the drive) on
(some?) promise controllers:
