It's as ugly as ssh-agent.
But I have to say, that I really like attachable namespaces bettern than
descriptor mount bind. It's a hell lot simpler to work with.

Well, yes and no. We should probably just have a syscall
int join_namespace(pid_t pid)
which would join the namespace process pid uses. And then have a PAM
session module, that would attach the namespace of the first user's
session (creating new namespace if this is the first session).

I'd have them garbage-collected. When last process using them goes away,
so does the namespace. If that's not what you want, start a persistent
process for the user.
