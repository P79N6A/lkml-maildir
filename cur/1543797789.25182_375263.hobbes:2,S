Oops, I somehow managed to remove the rest of this paragraph :(
The state field is not removed because I'm not a big fan of those
overloaded fields and I prefer to pay the 4 byte penalty for the
seperation.
Of course if there is the absolute requirement to reduce the size, I'm
not insisting on keeping it.
