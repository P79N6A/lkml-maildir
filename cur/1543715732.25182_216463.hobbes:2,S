True enough, I guess I was just following the "don't build it till you
need it" philosophy.

Sorry, should have done that earlier.  Looks reasonable with two small
exceptions: 1) put_page() can still theoretically call
__page_cache_release() which is wrong (and makes the code misleading)
- patch below replaces this with a BUG() if there is no destructor. 2)
what about wli's concern that mapping may be accessed without first
checking for a PageCompound?
