based on my experiance looking at the software released for tivos, I think 
you are over-estimating these numbers. if there are more then a dozen 
people producing things that are good enough to be useful and releasing 
their results as opensource software I would be surprised.
and for all that the FSF is claiming that tivos can't being modified it's 
really not that hard to change.
