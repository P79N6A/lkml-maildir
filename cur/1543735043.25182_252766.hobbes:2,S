I believe Broadcom 5704 (570x) chip/nic card come with 2 MIPS CPUs (133 MHz)
one each for both Tx and Rx data path.   The GIGE nic card cost < $50
couple years ago.
Too bad, the software SDK for them is closed (quoted at $96K couple years ago) .
Otherwise, there can be some interesting applications with that extremely
inexpensive chip/nic card.
RDMA over TCP/UDP with that chip/nic card over gige can be very interesting.
so is SSL proxy, SSH tunnel, etc.
With the right distributing processing design, it might even possible
to offload SMB,
NFS to the "right" nic card.
