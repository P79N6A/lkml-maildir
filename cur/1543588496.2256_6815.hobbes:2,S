Actually, I have seen this symptom [albeit intermittently: may be a
different cause] w. kernel 2.2.18/Xfree86-3 2.4.3/Xfree86-4 - gdm doesn't
say much, except to log one message long the lines of 'client auth
rejected' or 'connection rejected' or something like that. Haven't been
able to pin it down, except that when it happens once, it seems to happen
slightly more often for a while, and then the problem unpredictably goes
away after/for a while, sometimes for an extended period of time. [weeks
at a time, sometimes]. So it may not be possible to rule out gdm. [I'm
using the same version, but the problem occurred w. the previous version
too]
