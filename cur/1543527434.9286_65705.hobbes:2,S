Its called fbdev :) Their was discussion on the list about using the
console layer to actually set different mode versus the current method of
using the fbdev layer to alter the console mode. Personally I agree with
you. I think the console layer should handle this.

Kernel support for this would be insane. I would leave this up to a
userland app to perform.

I have noticed the delay as well when I change modes. Actally when I run
graphics programs ontop of fbdev I have alot of my consoles at different
resolutions.

I see you want a console layer to handle this :)

You just discribed the framebuffer console to a tee.
