When your driver does request_firmware() I believe udev is triggering
the /sbin/firmware_helper app.
rules.d/05-udev-early.rules:ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="firmware",
ENV{FIRMWARE}=="*", RUN="/sbin/firmware_helper", OPTIONS="last_rule"
This app could be made smarter and set a version/checksum into two
more sysfs attributes.
I also though that the firmware loader was going to be modified to
load the firmware via a firmware attribute located in the device node
instead of a global firmware attribute. But it doesn't look like that
change has been made. If the loading were done inside the device node
adding the version/checksum attributes would be more obvious.
/sbin/firmware_helper could set these attributes while loading the
file.
