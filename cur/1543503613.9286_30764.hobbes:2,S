I have today released the next revision to the HOWTO-Framebuffer. It now
includes a section on multi-headed displays, kindly donated by Frederick
A. Niles. I have taken over responsibility for distribution and
maintenance for his mini HOWTO-Multihead document, but he will retain all
copyrights to his document.

Alan ... why the deafening silence on the sysctl() thing? Is it because
I'm nuts? *8-)
Cheers, 
Alex
