I had this problem at some time, too. This was when I started to redo
the uClibc port to vax-linux, which I started with a hand-crafted
assembly file. It also crashed upon execution, though I was sure the
program was technically okay.
However, I haven't looked up any paper or standard to verify either
position. So I don't know for *sure* if it's legal to omit these
(empty) sections.
