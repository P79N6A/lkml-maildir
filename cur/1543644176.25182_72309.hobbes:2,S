I see the same problem. I am using a Belkin OmniView 4-port KVM switch and
a regular IBM 3-button ps2 mouse. My KVM switch is
hooked between two linux boxes. One box is running linux 2.4.19
kernel and the other linux 2.5.34. Whenever I swap over, the 2.5
machine  will not work with the mouse. I see the same behaviour
as reported and must reboot. Restarting gpm doesn't help...
However, I have no problems with the 2.4 machine
whenever I swap over. I only see this with 2.5. I also had 2.5.31
installed and saw the same wacky behaviour.
Prior to installing 2.5, both boxes had versions of 2.4 running
and I didn't have any problems swapping over with the KVM switch on either. 
I also am running gnome desktop on both machines.
