IMO, this is needed for broken keyboards, but in this exact form will
cause problems for those without them.
Pressing alt-sysrq accidentally is rare, but happens, typically when 
I'm going for vt-12 in a hurry, or cleaning out crumbs.
Normally this is fairly harmless, as most of the dangerous keys are
on a different quadrant.
Making it sticky makes accidents much more likely.
I'd suggest either making this behaviour optional, or making it so that
hitting alt-sysrq twice, without any other keys being pressed makes the
next key stick.
