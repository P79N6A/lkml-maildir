This was solved some weeks ago and the patch is pending somewhere (marcelo?).
Unfortunately the complete cure is inside this pending patch, because there are
other small tweaks for i830M. The NULL-check is sufficient for non-oops, but
i830-register size is smaller than the further ongoings inside agpgart_be.c.
