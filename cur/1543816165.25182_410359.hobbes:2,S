Subject: [PATCH 000 of 3] md: Introduction - 3 assorted md fixes
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Three little fixes.
The last is possibly most interesting as it highlight how wrong I managed
to get the BIO_BARRIER stuff in raid1, which I really thought I had tested.
I'm happy of this and the previous collection of raid5-growth patches
to be merged into 2.6.17-rc1.  I had hoped the raid5-growth could sit
in -mm a bit longer, but I didn't get them there in time, and I'd
rather not wait until after 2.6.17.  They have received a reasonable
amount of testing both by me and others and appear to be safe.
Thanks,
NeilBrown
