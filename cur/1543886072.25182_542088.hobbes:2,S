Oliver:
While running kernel-2.6.21.1-sd-0.48 + this and the other patch I mentioned,
Unforch, this patch doesn't seem to have effected my usb-serial problems, for 
upsd anyway, it's running at 47% of the cpu right now, while running sd-0.48.
Occasionally a stop and restart will fix it...  Nope.  On the restart, its 
about 3% _until_ something starts reading its output data file, which could 
be gkrellmBUPS, or its own gui, either one bounces it back up to 45+% of the 
cpu.  On a kernel where it works sorta right, as in a recent fedora kernel, 
its about 1.5%, and on even older 2.6.18ish stuff, this utility ran at .1% of 
the cpu regardless of who read its output data.  But that was with a pl2303 
adapter, which no longer works at all so I bought some ftdi based ones.
So the next boot will be to cfs-v10 + these.
