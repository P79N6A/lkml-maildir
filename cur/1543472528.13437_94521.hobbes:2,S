Patents were a scheme by which individual non rich inventors traded information
about their product for 17 years (which at the time was short term) protection
and monopoly rights.
That is no longer true, the whole justification is gone. Capitalism exists
to foster progress and competition in the interest of the people. Patents
are now part of a positively stalinist US corporate agenda and little
else.

Patent them all, wait 10 years for someone to release one of them and file
a multimillion dollar lawsuit with a law firm on a percentage winnings no
cost lose basis - its the American way.
