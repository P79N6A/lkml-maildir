Current cryptd works well for AES-NI implementation. But how about
somebody want cryptd(cbc(aes)), and don't care about the driver.

Yes, not an issue for AES-NI case until now. But, for example there is
no aes-ni, if someone request cryptd(cbc(aes-asm)), other user will get
cryptd(cbc(aes-asm)) instead of cbc(aes-asm) when request cbc(aes), is
this a good behavior?
