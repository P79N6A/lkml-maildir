Real life example. I had to compile latest kopete (im KDE application). It 
takes 4h and some on my 600 Mhz crusoe (128MB of RAM). On 600 mhz p3 it takes 
1.5h. And this is thing i just get used to, this processor is fast only for 
non complex operations, since it got to "emulate" x86.
I know for some tablets You can download BIOS dedicated for Windows and 
sepearate one for Linux. I guess it was AQUA or simmilar. Well you can even 
buy this one with preinstalled linux on it (i belive it is midori linux, 
transmeta's embded linux distro).
