Yes, it does make things much much harder to debug - but:
* If you get a problem on a preemtive UP kernel, it is likely to be a problem
  on a SMP too - and those are hard to debug aswell. But the positive aspect
  is that you get more people that can do the debugging... :-)
  (One CPU gets delayed with handling a IRQ the other runs into the critical
   section)
* It is optional at compile time.
   And could even be made run time optional / CPU ! Just set a too big value
   on the counter and it will never reschedule...
