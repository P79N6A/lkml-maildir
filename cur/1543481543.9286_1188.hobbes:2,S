Wow, my second posting in two days.  As I have not yet subscribed to the
list can I as that you CC me (yup to that horrifyingly ugly from
address) on any responses.
I am wondering why the vesafb (VESA Frame Buffer device) is not a
module?  I like building stripped down kernels (even to the point of
putting my load time devices into an initrd ramdisk) that I can run on a
variety of machines.  I have some machines that use the Matro frame
buffer framebuffer device but others that use the standard VESA frame
buffer.
I would like to decide at run time which frame buffer to run, depending
on of course the hardware in the box.  Compiling one kernel with the
vesa frame buffer in (for video cards without a specific frame buffer
driver) and then one without (to run a specific frame buffer) to satisfy
this kinda sucks.  :-)
As a side note, anyone know of a source for the frame buffer version of
the Xserver?
Thanx,
b.
