 It might indeed be scary to suddenly change the command bits on some
old "Host bridges" and maybe other classes of bridges. I was too
optimistic about the triviality of the fix.
Still an obvious improvement to the pci_read_bases() code would be to
not try sizing non-existings BARs (that way if a device has no memory
bars, we never need to touch the mem-enable bit). In addition, if you
exclude Host bridges and other bridges from temporary mem-disabling
while sizing their BARs, then doing temp disabling for the remaining
devices looks less scary than the alternative (messing live with the
bars decoding range especially for regular devices integrated to the
main chipset).
It seems to me worth making that init code safer independantly of the
mmconfig issues.

Here is a trace where COMMAND/STATUS and 0x10 and 0x14 registers
accesses were captured. Comments in brackets are my interpretation of
what's happening. That was with windows 2003 64bit.
