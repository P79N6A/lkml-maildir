<checking dictionary> Ah yes, I did mean temporary. I will correct it with 
my next patch. When I have a patch that is, for now I will enjoy my short 
happy life of being among the gods. (-;
Anyway, thanks for pointing it out. I would probably never have noticed it 
otherwise. (English being my third language and all...)
Alan and Trever:
Thanks a lot for the supporting words!!! They are very much appreciated!
And I quite agree with what both of you have said. - I find it sometimes 
quite difficult to "get the point" of some jokes based on language. - 
Fortunately I understood this one. (-:
This is getting rather off topic now so we should probably drop this 
subject (at least from LKML)...
Best regards,
         Anton
