OK, I gave 2.6.3-rc3-mm1 a try and could reproduce it.
I still compile with CONFIG_DEVFS_FS=y and
CONFIG_DEVFS_MOUNT=y, but to use udev boot with devfs=nomount.
I then booted with devfs=mount acpi=off noapic. Guess what ? I
was able to unmount all offending modules.
What next ? Boot with devfs=mount to see if ACPI was to blame.
No, it wasn't.
My /etc/rc.d/rc.S is very simple:
[ -e /dev/.devfsd -a -x /sbin/devfsd ] && devfsd /dev
(only run devfsd if devfs is mounted)
mount -vn -t proc proc /proc # Needed for LABEL= in /etc/fstab
mount -vn -t sysfs sysfs /sys
[ ! -e /dev/.devfsd -a -d /sys/block ] && /etc/rc.d/start_udev
(only run start_udev if devfs isn't mounted and sysfs is
mounted)
Since 2.6.4 works fine for me using devfs=nomount, something is
broken. I'm using the latest udev and hotplug.
I'm attaching a strace of a rmmod that failed.
