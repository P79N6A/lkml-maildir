The users do not distingush between kernel thread and thread. They just
want a thread and assume it is lightweight. Linux effectively gives them
only heavy threads currently, which they usually do not need.
(like the "posix programmer
knows the availability of everything, but the cost of nothing", to adapt
a maybe not fitting saying)

I argue that actually sometimes, but usually fail. At least I think
if they really want to use threads it should not hurt the rest of the system.
