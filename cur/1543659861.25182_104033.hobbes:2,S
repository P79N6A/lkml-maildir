Well, that depends on whether A defines S or not.  If A does
define S, then I don't care.  I'd say "no", A does not depend
on B.  If A does not define S, then most definitely "yes", as
with any other definition.

I just told you.  Quoted again above.  Perhaps the following
dummy module will make things even clearer.
---
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/init.h>
extern int not_defined __attribute__((weak));
static int init(void)
{
  return &not_defined ? -EINVAL : 0;
}
static void fini(void)
{
}
module_init(init);
module_exit(fini);

You should be able to load this module.
