Hello,
First of all - thanks to these people, who responded
to my question.
I have some news...
I've tried kernels:
2.4.19 - the same result
2.5.44 - the same result
2.5.45 - the same result
If I take 1 Gb of memory away, then computer works
much better, faster (something like without enabled
HIGHMEM at all).
The same effect takes place if I say mem=1024M while
physically box has 2Gb of RAM - everything is fine!
But if I start HIGHMEM enabled kernel on this box (2Gb
RAM), then it works too slowly...
The questions are:
1. is there anyone on the list, who has the same or
near configuration ? (main is that the box has >=2Gb
of RAM)
2. do you experience the same problems ?
3. maybe it's not a problem at all?!? I mean maybe
linux kernel works this way with such amount of memory
and there is no problem with that?
4. the case I've described =
http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2001-02/0292.html
?
and finally, if this could be solved - please tell,
how should I set up the kernel/kernel settings to get
appropriate results in performance ?
Thank you.
