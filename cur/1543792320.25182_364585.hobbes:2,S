This patch is a combination of function renaming, variable
initialization/assignment and return path/etc. oddities, plus some
functional changes (did I catch them all?) which apparently took a bit
of effort to get to after sifting through the rest of that.
Dump the parallel cleanups or split them into pure cleanup and pure
functional patches. I don't mind the cleanups, I mind the mixing.
