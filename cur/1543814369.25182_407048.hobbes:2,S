I started subdividing the _TMP method, and found that
hangs: -AC0 (as reported in the last email)
okay:  -AC0-TMP (also in last email)
but
okay: -AC0-one line of TMP, by which I mean getting rid of the 
EC0.UPDT() line below:
            Method (_TMP, 0, NotSerialized)
            {
                \_SB.PCI0.ISA0.EC0.UPDT ()
                Store (\_SB.PCI0.ISA0.EC0.TMP0, Local0)
                If (LGreater (Local0, 0x0AAC))
                {
                    Return (Local0)
                }
                Else
                {
                    Return (0x0BB8)
                }
            }
So that's a small change in which having a line means the hang
happens, and not having the line means it goes away.
By the way, I just checked -AC0-TMP and it was okay (no hang).  That
data point is consistent with TMP & (PSV | AC0).

I will try that right now (leaving TMP as in the vanilla DSDT).
