I could not resist to reply: yep, get some real hardware. If you have money to
buy half a terrabyte RAID for swap and 16GB memory, the $1000 for a fast
board with some 64bit CPU will be nothing against other expenses.
And the performance will be many times better.
If you'd still want to experiment with IA32, maybe you'd better write an
emulator of some 64bit CPU (UltraSPARC, Alpha, Merced) for IA32 and run the
kernel in it. The performance difference between your solution and this one
would not be that big. Get real.
Cheers,
