just ask the "system management guy" exactly *what* seems to be the
problem with nfs-utils 1.0.5. i have 1.0.6 running with no problems.

well, that's a pretty good error message, don't you think? a quick grep
with this error on your local kernel-sources will show that the message
is from: arch/ia64/scripts/toolchain-flags.
upgrading binutils (and other tools too) to the recommended versions as
shown in Documentation/Changes would be a first step. maybe system
management guy can help with that ;-)
Christian.
