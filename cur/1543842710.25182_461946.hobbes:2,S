I've been using acpi on that motherboard since early 2.5, and it works
fine. But I still need that quirk to get it working. 
The acpi guys are well aware of my problem since early 2004, but hasn't
been able to fix it yet, at least.

So if you disable the quirk for me, my computer will be without usb and
acpi...
Still, noone would be happier than me if this is solved "the right way".
Thanks.
Best regards,
Stian
