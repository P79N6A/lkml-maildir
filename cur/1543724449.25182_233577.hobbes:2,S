Subject: [PATCH] hugetlbfs private mappings.

Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
Hugetlbfs silently coerce private mappings of hugetlb files
into shared ones. So private writable mapping has MAP_SHARED
semantics. I think, such mappings should be disallowed.
First, such behavior allows open hugetlbfs file O_RDONLY, and
overwrite it via mmap(PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE), so
it is security bug.
Second, private writable mmap() should fail just because kernel
does not support this.
I beleive, it is ok to allow private readonly hugetlb mappings,
sys_mprotect() does not work with hugetlb vmas.
There is another problem. Hugetlb mapping is always prefaulted,
pages allocated at mmap() time. So even readonly mapping allows
to enlarge the size of the hugetlbfs file, and steal huge pages
without appropriative permissions.
Patch on top of vm_pgoff fixes, see
