I realize this question has been partially answered before but the
answer is no longer useful as it has a broken URL.  I tried to
contact the original author.
I would like to use the ASUS P5A motherboard which is Alladin based
for some production machines.
 - Where is the patch to allow the IDE drivers to work with the
   alladin chipset?  If anyone has a copy they could send me.
 - Is this patch no longer necessary for some recent 2.2.x 
   kernel versions?  Starting with which version?
 - Will the driver work at all without the patch (i.e. in PIO mode
   instead of DMA)?  What is the performance hit?  More importantly,
   can one install a RedHat distribution before recompiling the
   kernel?  If we are just talking about 12MB/s vs 6MB/s transfer
   rates, I am not concerned.
 - Is the patched version stable?
