No. You set out to create a product you care about and create an
environment where good taste and talent (with or without particular tools)
is valued and shared. Outside of the debugger maintenance issue, that's
more or less what I see here today.

I think I do. I also understand that half of the fun of producing any
program is to make something of utility, not a pure work of art. 'Show me
the code' means create something that works and don't spend the next 10  
years doing it, no?

The primary mechanism for "selecting for" and encouraging those traits is
code review, not barriers to entry. Add an IKD build option and
maintainers will suddenly start accepting "this seems to fix it but I have
no idea why" patches? I don't think this follows.
More likely is that slightly more programmers, and therefore slightly more
potentially good programmers will get their feet wet in the kernel source
by attempting to debug their own problems.
