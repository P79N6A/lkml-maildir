	While this is an interesting defect in my analogy, it's not relevant to
copyright because here we're talking solely about property wholly created.
So the alternative to my owning all the land you could travel to would be
that land not existing.

	As I made clear, your right to profit to the idea is the same type of right
as your right to do what you want with your bat. It doesn't include taking
it onto my property to break my windows.

	Since we're talking copyright here and not patent, two independent
developers would both have equal right to authorize the use or distribution
of the idea.

	You have the right to walk the streets at night with hundred dollar bills
danglnig out of your pockets and nobody has the right to steal the money
from you. That doing so is stupid and will likely make you the victim of a
crime doesn't change your right one iota. Heer we see a difference between
rights that are both legal and moral and what you can practically achieve.
	Yes, it's a defect in our legal system that wealthy powerful people can
manipulate it with extreme effectiveness. Yes, it's a defect in our
legislative system that companies like Disney can exert enormous control
over what laws are passed. But these aren't really copyright issues in
principle.

	This is just equivocation on the "it". Legally, the "it" you own is not any
particular word or 'diff' output, it's the original creative effort that you
added. If I translate Hamlet into Polish, there is no physical way to
isolate my contribution from Shakespeare's, but that doesn't mean we don't
understand that there is creative effort that you added and that the total
work contains your creative effort and Shakespeare's.
	This may be confusing for people not familiar with intellectual property
law. But trust me (or do some research or talk to an intellectual property
lawyer), it creates no legal problems or problems of principle whatsoever.
Your copyright rights to what you produce in no way affects what anyone can
do with, or what you can do to, anything that came before you.
