Hi list,
Today I switched from 2.6.2 to 2.6.3 mostly for the new radeonfb driver.
Everything looked fine until I tried to burn a DVD with my external
DVD-writer (Plextor PX708UF), which worked without a problem in 2.6.2.
While trying to burn some files to it with growisofs I got the following
error message
and the program froze.

Trying the same with USB 2.0 worked without a problem.
Looking through the changelog I saw that both the scsi and ieee1394
subsystem got several updates.
Can someone help me debug this further? Since the USB side seems to work
ok ( I tried it only once), I think that the problem lies between ieee1394 and scsi. 
Please CC: since I am not subscribed to the list.
Thanks in advance,
Michael
