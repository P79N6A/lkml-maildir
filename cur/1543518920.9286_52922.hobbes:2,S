Using 2.3.29 setup for uniprocessor, I can get the kernel to recognize that the
drive has 70720 cyls, but gets upset that the partition table is bad.  The
partition table was built with a stock Redhat 6.1 install.  The boot parameters
that I used were "ide0=0xfce8,0xfcf6 hda=65535,16,63".  Pretty nasty, but it
worked.  Also, with these parameters, the system has a problem talking to the
partition table.  Fdisk and Cfdisk both crash, but the kernel recognizes the
partition table just fine.
Any suggestions on how to see all of the drive?
Thanks,
