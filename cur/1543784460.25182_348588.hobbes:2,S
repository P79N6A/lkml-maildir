Ah, right.  I'm using kdb with it.  (And my recollection of when
show_stack did have a framepointer version, is that it was hopelessly
broken on interrupt frames, and we're much better off without it.)

Don't need them, but find them as useful on x86_64 as on i386?
Certainly, I can go on patching in FRAME_POINTERs for x86_64
as I have done, no problem with that.  But it seems both bogus
and unhelpful to have that "&& !X86_64" in lib/Kconfig.debug -
framepointers are as helpful/useless on x86_64 as the rest.
