Hi,
I've just tested it on 2.4.23 as well -- no problems found, although the
XFS option patch needs updating -- probably as much as the 2.6 XFS code
(though the latter seems to suspend... I'll get to it later today).
Attached is the patch to bring the XFS code for 2.4 up to date (note: this
is not the whole xfs-option, it should be applied on top of the latter; I
can prepare a complete xfs-option if you care).
Oh, BTW: the slowdown I mentioned for 2.6 seems to hit this version also,
but in a different manner: I/O is fine, but the resuming kernel spends some
time on displaying "Freezing processes" -- what was unnoticeable under rc2
is somewhat awkward with rc3.
Best regards,
