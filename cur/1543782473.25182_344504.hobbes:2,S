 Hello all,
    I am a newbee tryinging for serial port
multiplexing. Currently my driver supports for one
port
(/dev/ttyS0). However i want to use the same physical
port for 2 virtual ports.I am NOT sending two type of
data simultaneously. I want to first reigister my
driver for /dev/ttyS0. When the kernel  has booted ,i
want to disable it. Then i want to enable the driver
to register for say /dev/ttyS1.
  in short i don't want the console to have controle
over the serial port.
  The point of doing such is that i want my serial
port to be free. I can telnet to this potr from other
machine and test few stuff. i hope i have properly
mentioned my problem.
 plz let me know how should i proceed.
 thanks in advance.
 regards,
  rahul
