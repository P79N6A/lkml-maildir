[ There's no point in continuing the idle-cpus-wont-get-rescheduled
  thread. What made me respond anyway is another issue Andrea now
  mentioned; see below for details. I'll just say that the
  write-one-function-at-a-time approach doesn't work. You do the whole
  module and worry about external interfaces. Expecting to be able to
  hack an internal function and not have to check, and if necessary
  fix everything that depends on the old behaviour is silly. ]

the above does not make much sense (i think you meant RT tasks), but
i do see an issue with the stock reschedule_idle ("issue" because
i'm not yet convinced it makes much difference. Will think about this
more though.) [This is different from the previously mentioned
scenarios (no idle cpus involved).]
The scenario is: All cpus are busy and at least one of them is
running a "normal" thread; now a RT thread wakes up whose last cpu is
already running another RT thread -- the cpu executing the "normal"
thread is not guaranteed to be immediately rescheduled.
No, this does not appear to be a big issue. I'm not even convinced it
actually would make a noticable difference it RL. It's certainly
something to keep in mind when updating the scheduler related SMP
code. [i started doing this a while ago, but as it involved changes
across many architectures i've dropped that patch. I'll probably
do it in a few months, if nobody else beats me to it... ;)]
