Well, what can I say?
I haven't been a big fan of doing hibernation this way since the very beginning
and I still have the same reservations.  Namely, my opinion is that the
hibernation-related problems we have are not just solvable this way.  For one
example, in order to stop using the freezer for suspend/hibernation we first
need to revamp the suspending/resuming of devices (uder way) and the
kexec-based approach doesn't help us here.  I wouldn't like to start another
discussion about it though.
That said, I can imagine some applications of the $subject functionality
not directly related to hibernation.  For example, one can use it for kernel
debgging (jump to a new kernel, change something in the old kernel's
data, jump back and see what happens etc.).  Also, in principle it may be used
for such things as live migration of VMs.
Thanks,
