Can you see if it is looping in userspace or kernel? Can you kill -9
the process?
Are you able to test with the latest 2.6.23-rc kernel? If not (or if it
still has the same problem), then can you get the output of sysrq+T
and three sysrq+P calls, please? (this might help work out where in
kernel it is spinning).
