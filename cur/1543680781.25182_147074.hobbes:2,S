Okay, that makes sense.  Particularly the debugging and testing part.  And 
for an excellent example of _documented_ paranoia, see the source to 
schedule_timeout().
But if you look very far through the kernel sources you will see many 
occurrences of code similar to this:
	static void release(struct xxx *ptr)
	{
		if (!ptr)
			return;
	...
I can't see any reason for keeping something like that.
