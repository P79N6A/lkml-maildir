If you're referring to code running on the hardware DSP, that is indeed
my plan.  An ioctl() to download code to the DSP, the code provided by
the user-space package.
In general, the driver will do signal processing in software.  It's not
obvious where to put the programming, mainly because it doesn't matter.
It seems very likely a user space daemon will do _something_.
Possibly kernel space will be used to enforce certain homologation
rules, like "can't stay off hook for > X seconds without a signal, or <
Y seconds".  User-space will be involved in _setting_ those parameters,
then the kernel is responsible for enforcing them should the user-space
part die for some reason.  I'm not sure how necessary that is.
There's another complication: I don't think it's possible to accurately
simulate a serial terminal over a pty.
