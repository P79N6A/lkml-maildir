That was a sparc64 patch, and sparc 64bit userland programs are not
supported until some 2.3.40 or so (and even then it's me and at most 2-3
other people who run it so far).
The kernel translates it into int _fd; int _band; anyway during copy to
userland for 32bit apps (but it is imperfect and unless my siginfo patch
makes it in or some other similar solution is added, it will be always).
Cheers,
