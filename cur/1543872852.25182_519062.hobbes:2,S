I've found a place to put theses patches to:

http://linux-dev.qc.ec.gc.ca/kernel/rsdl/2.6.18.8-rsdl-0.29-0.30.patch
There is also a Debian Etch x86_64 2.6.18-rsdl-0.30 kernel available at:

.18.8-rsdl-0.30-amd64-envcan_2.6.18.8-rsdl-0.30-003_amd64.deb
http://linux-dev.qc.ec.gc.ca/kernel/debian/etch/x86_64/linux-image-2.6.1
8.8-rsdl-0.30-amd64-envcan_2.6.18.8-rsdl-0.30-003_amd64.deb
