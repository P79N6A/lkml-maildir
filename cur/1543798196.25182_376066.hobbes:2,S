Well a version for 2.6.15-rc2 is still at sf.net/projects/linuxjail.  I
haven't resubmitted to lkml in a long time because I haven't found or
implemented a better solution for the network virtualization, which
Christoph wasn't happy with.  The vserver ngnet or openvz networking may
be a good solution.  Additionally, the pid virtualization we've been
discussing (and which should be submitted soon) would remove the need
for the tasklookup patch, so bsdjail would reduce even further, to
network and simple access controls.
Note that I would prefer to see the full vserver in the kernel...
