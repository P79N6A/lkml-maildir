I totally agree. That's why I specifically said a _survey_ and  not an actual
HOWTO. I think that a survey of currently used strategies would speed up our
individual assessments of what is right for us. I suspect there are packages out
there using interesting strategies that I have no time to study, or am not even
aware of. Its exteremely time consuming looking through them. I would very much
appreciate a survey that expresses as little opnion as possible. This could
probably be said of many other areas of software design, too.
