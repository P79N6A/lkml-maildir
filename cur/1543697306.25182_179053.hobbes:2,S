Yes.. if you run the mentioned two loops on an SMP box, you will find that
dcache_readdir is looping with dcache_lock held up in less than a minute. 
The problem comes when sysfs_remove_dir has done list_del_init on the cursor 
dentry which is being used in dcache_readdir. Please enable pr_debug() also 
in sysfs_remove_dir to see the this happening.
