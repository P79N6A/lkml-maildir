Subject: [PATCH 4/4] lumpy take the other active inactive pages in the area
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

lumpy: take the other active/inactive pages in the area
When we scan an order N aligned area around our tag page take any
other pages with a matching active state to that of the tag page.
This will tend to demote areas of the order we are interested from
the active list to the inactive list and from the end of the inactive
list, increasing the chances of such areas coming free together.
