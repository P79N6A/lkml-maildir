Andrew, pcounter is a temporary abstraction.
It is temporaty because it will vanish as soon as Christoph Clameter (or 
somebody else) provides real cheap per cpu counter implementation.
At time I introduced it in network tree (locally, not meant to invade kernel 
land and makes you unhappy :) ), the goals were :
Some counters (total sockets count) were a single integer, that were doing 
ping-pong between cpus (SMP/NUMA). As they are basically lazy values (as we 
dont really need to read their value), using plain atomic_t was overkill.
Using a plain percpu_counters was expensive (NR_CPUS*(32+sizeof(void *)) 
instead of num_possible_cpus()*4).
Using 'online' instead of 'possible' stuff is not really needed for a 
temporary thing.
- We dont care of read sides. We want really fast write side. Real fast.
Read side is when you do a "cat /proc/net/sockstat".
That is ... once in a while...
Now when we allocate a new socket, code to increment the "socket count" is :
c03a74a8 <tcp_pcounter_add>:
c03a74a8:   b8 90 26 5f c0          mov    $0xc05f2690,%eax
c03a74ad:   64 8b 0d 10 f1 5e c0    mov    %fs:0xc05ef110,%ecx
c03a74b4:   01 14 01                add    %edx,(%ecx,%eax,1)
c03a74b7:   c3                      ret
That is 4 instructions. I could be two in the future, thanks to current work 
on fs/gs based percpu variables.
Current percpu_counters implementation is more expensive :

Once it is better, just make pcounter vanish.
It is even clearly stated at the top of include/linux/pcounter.h
/*
  * Using a dynamic percpu 'int' variable has a cost :
  * 1) Extra dereference
  * Current per_cpu_ptr() implementation uses an array per 'percpu variable'.
  * 2) memory cost of NR_CPUS*(32+sizeof(void *)) instead of num_possible_cpus()*4
  *
  * This pcounter implementation is an abstraction to be able to use
  * either a static or a dynamic per cpu variable.
  * One dynamic per cpu variable gets a fast & cheap implementation, we can
  * change pcounter implementation too.
  */
We all agree.
Thank you
