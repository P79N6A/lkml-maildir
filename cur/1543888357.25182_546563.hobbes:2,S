Richard's patchset added it to the crypto library and wired it into
the JFFS2 file system.  We recently started using LZO in a userland UDP
proxy to do stateless per-packet payload compression over a WAN link.
With ~1000 octet packets, our particular data stream sees 60% compression
with zlib, and 50% compression with (mini-)LZO, but LZO runs at ~5.6x
the speed of zlib.  IIRC, that translates into > 700Mbps on the input
side on a 2GHZ Opteron, without any further tuning.
Once LZO is in the kernel, I'd like to see it wired into IPComp.
Unfortunately, last I checked only the "deflate" algorithm had an
assigned compression parameter index (CPI), so one will have to use a
private index until an official one is assigned.
