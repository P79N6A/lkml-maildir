ooh, that's always risky - we just don't know what people are doing out
there.  They do the damnedest things.
Is it possible to implement the new behaviour while retaining the old
behaviour as well?  And to detect when an app is using the old behaviour
and to drop a printk("stop doing this")?  So we can kill the old behaviour
in a year or so?

Depends what you're trying to do.  Different threads in the same process
can share the same file*'s.
