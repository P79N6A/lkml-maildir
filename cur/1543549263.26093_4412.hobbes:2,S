Linus,
You forgot to mention that some folks also code with C++ in these user
libs -- result, new and constructor/destructor operations will create
all kinds of hidden memory allocations all over the place that the C++
compiler hides from the coder and that impact performance.  
NetWare uses a model close to yours with a pico-kernel-lib for the
kernel proper and all the other lib crap goes up in the user environment
-- the kernel does not link to any commercial libs either for the
reasons you stated, and the problems with C++ code in kernel.  C++ let's
programmers get sloppy and lets them create convoluted code that is so
unreadable and unmaintainable it assures job security.  I sometimes
believe this is why C++ was created to begin with.  
Alot of the W2K kernel is C++, which explains why it's such a pig. 
Structured exception handling is nice, but the hidden memory allocations
can really bite on performance.
:-)
