Yes. I realized how broken it was when I did the conversion, but I didn't 
have anybody that I knew of that actually _used_ it, so I didn't bother 
trying to fix it.
It's been broken for a long time, even before the IRQ_NONE/IRQ_HANDLED
fixes (the disable/enable counting was out of whack).
Your fix looks fine. You must be one of a _very_ small group of people 
using this. Thanks,
