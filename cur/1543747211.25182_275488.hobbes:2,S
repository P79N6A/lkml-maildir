Even timer interrupts are incredibly unpredictable.  Instructions can 
take
variable times to complete, and all instructions plus some indeterminate
cache operations and queue flushing must occur before the CPU can
even begin to service an interrupt.  Also of note, there are small 
critical
sections with interrupts disabled scattered all over the kernel and 
scheduler,
in addition to varying memory latencies, etc. (NOTE: I am not an arch 
expert
so this is all just a very general overview of the way most kinds of 
CPUs
handle interrupts).  In general these unpredictable instabilities have a
randomization effect on the low bits of the TSC at each timer interrupt,
(or arch equivalent).  The same thing goes for most other such events.  
I
suspect that the computational power necessary to provide a useful model
of such a system would be so tremendous you would have an easier job
just trying all the possible cryptographic keys. :-D
