I guess your argument is the old "Linux is user friendly, it's just
picky about its users". Today, I don't buy it.  Linux is becoming much
more user friendly, more so with non developers.  I'm starting to see
that if I want to keep being paid for kernel development, more and more
non-developer users are needed to exist.
Yes, there are several non-developers that are great and bend over
backwards to help us solve problems (Mark Knetch, a guitar player,
constantly does this to help us on -rt).  But they are few and far
between.  Some are just too intimidated by what goes on in their
computer, and might give up and say: "this Linux stuff is just too hard,
and is not worth it" before they realize it would be.
Basically, anything that makes it easier for users to help us solve bugs
in hardware is important.  If I know there's a bug on something that I
don't own, I would want it fixed with the help of the first user that
discovers it, than saying "oh well, he gave up, I'll just wait for the
next one".  That would drive me crazy.

I know people who call themselves programmers that still don't "get it".
So, really, the answer is "No", people can't always learn, and a lot
don't want to.  Programming and debugging is a talent.  No matter how
hard I try to sing, I still wont be good enough to survive living in a
subway.
