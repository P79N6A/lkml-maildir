It doesn't matter.  The type number space is per-name.  It doesn't make sense
to look at the type without first looking at the name, so it doesn't matter if
different names reuse the same type numbers.

The common approach is to include the size of the structure within the
structure itself.  If you add new fields, add them to the end.  If you want a
field, make sure it exists in the structure.  You only need to worry about
major version changes if you change the meaning of a field within the
structure.
