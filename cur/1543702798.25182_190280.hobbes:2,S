Sometimes there's a reason to use the old kernel headers...I still run 
several apps that can't grok the 2.6 headers, and will only compile with 
2.4 ones (and they work fine).  I have a couple of small scripts that 
switch the directories around when I need them, for convenience.  :)
Of course, the real solution would be to hack them to work with new 
headers, but I don't have the time for that at the moment.  *Sigh*
