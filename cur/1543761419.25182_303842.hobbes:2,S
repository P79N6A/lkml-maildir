Add it to the changelog and maintain it, please.  It never hurts.
But that only describes why we want the feature, which is nice.  It's also
useful to explain how the feature works.  Although my preference there is
that this be done within code comments if at all appropriate.
<looks>
OK, so we're splitting each zone's buddy structure into two: one for zeroed
pages and one for not-zeroed pages, yes?
It's not obvious what the page->private of freed pages are being used for. 
Please comment that.
What's all this (zero << 10) stuff?
+	page->private = order + (zero << 10);
+           (page_zorder(page) == order + (zero << 10)) &&
Doesn't this explode if we already have order-1024 pages in there?  I guess
that's a reasonable restriction, but where did the "10" come from? 
Non-obvious, needs commenting.
And given that we have separate buddy structures for zeroed and not-zeroed
pages, why is this tagging needed at all?
These are all design decisions which have been made, but they're not
communicated either in the patch description or in code comments.  It's to
everyone's advantage to fix that, no?
