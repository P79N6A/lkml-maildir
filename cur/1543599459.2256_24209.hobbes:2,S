under 'normal loads' (ie one tcp d/l at max, few other traffic) the
situation didn' get better, it hangs as often as with the original
via-rhine, at least it feels so. No hard figures here. But even
writing this mail (via ssh) here parallel to a download over the lan
(from the same server) triggers resets.
under heavy loads (ie with multiple flood pings) it resets often but I
couldn't push it over the edge anymore. I have it running now for
several minutes under multiple pingfloods and it always recovered
(from quite a amount of resets).
At least it recovers now. Thank you for your time and work!
