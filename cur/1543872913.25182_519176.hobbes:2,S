And broken stuff too :-)
The nanoseconds patch is broken on x86_64 - makes mtimes from the future:
e.g. year 2431. I suspect an endianness issue.
x86 works fine according to my sources.
The files themselves have correct mtimes, as booting previous kernel
or one w/o the nanoseconds patch works fine.
