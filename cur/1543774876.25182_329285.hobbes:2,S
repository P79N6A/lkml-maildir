That should be fine. Net result is the page has been looked up.
What kind of atomicity did you imagine the locked find_get_page
provides that I haven't?

Ditto. Net result is that the page has been looked up. The
speculative get page will recheck that it is in the radix
tree after taking a reference, and if so then it assumes that
reference to be valid.
What is the hangup with the page allocator?

I can imagine. I don't think I've seen one yet.

You said "this RFC seems to have too far to go to use it to
conclude anything about the subject", after failing to find
any holes in the actual implementation.
And (parahprasing) "this needs memory barriers but I won't say
where or why, somebody else deal with it" doesn't count as a
specific thing.
