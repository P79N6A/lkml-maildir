Hello all,
	Recently, I was trying to install RHL5.1 (kernel 2.0.x) on my
friend's PC ( P233, 32MB DRAM,Seagate 2.1GB HDD, Intel Chipset, etc, etc).
I created the installation floppy and booted thru it. I got the normal
messages (printed out by the drivers, etc). Then the machine rebooted
without warning. I did not get any login prompt. This sequence continued(s).
	There are no apparent hardware defects. Win95 is installed on
one of the partitions, and it *runs* (cough). 
	I then created a couple of heuristic installation disks with lots
of debug messages in the 'start_kernel' routine. After trying out the
same, I was able to successfully determine that the machine rebooted 
when/after it entered the 'cpu_idle(NULL)' routine.
	My apologies if I am reporting something that has already been
reported. In any case, I need to know what the problem is.
					thanks, action!
