Sorry, for not having done this in the first mail already: I've found
another occurence of the problem in a logfile, which I had forgotten
about:

This was 2.4.7-ac3 compiled w/ an earlier version of gcc
(2.96-85). And in deed, my problem was sometimes accompanied by a
'kernel: hdc: lost interrupt'. But this seems to have gone, because I
removed one disk from the system and moved hdc -> hda.
That there's such a long period between these two occurences, doesn't
mean, that my machine did not hang in the meantime, but I did not find
anything in the logs. Perhaps the messages didn't make it through?
