But the problem seems not like you said.
if enable crtscts by default, your thoughts makes sense.
But if disable crtscts by default, the fact is not as your thoughts.
The following is the test result on my side.
===================================
root:~> cflag = 0x80001cb1, old = 0x1cb1
cflag = 0x1cb1, old = 0x80001cb1
cflag = 0x1cb1, old = 0x1cb1
===================================
When run "stty -F /dev/ttyS0 crtscts",
I got
------------
root:~> cflag = 0x80001cb1, old = 0x1cb1
------------
That means crtscts in the old terminal setting is disabled. Now it's enabled.
But When I type "ENTER" key,
I got
------------
cflag = 0x1cb1, old = 0x80001cb1
cflag = 0x1cb1, old = 0x1cb1
------------
That means terminal setting is back to crtscts disabled. But here I
didn't do anything to disable it, I just type "ENTER", crtscts setting
should keep enabled. What makes it back to disabled? Now I guess there
must be something wrong with serial core.
