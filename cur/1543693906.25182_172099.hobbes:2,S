*Please* read the linux-kernel FAQ before posting again.  There *is* a
jobs list.
21. Can I post job offers/requests to the list?
    (REG) Of course not!  This is a technical development list, not a job
    exchange.  If you want to join a job exchange list, send
        subscribe linuxjobs
    in the body of the message to <majordomo@eax.com> by executing
    the following command:
        echo "subscribe linuxjobs" | mail majordomo@eax.com
    To send messages, email to <linuxjobs@eax.com>.
Thank you,
-- Jamie
