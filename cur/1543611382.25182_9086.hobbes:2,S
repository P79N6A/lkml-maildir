	Could the person who switched from BKL to spin_lock_irqsave() in
pc_keyb.c please share whatever the hell he had been smoking?  Free clue:

	Linus, could we please revert that crap and feed the authors to
Larry?  If they are religious about Scalability At Any Cost, Common Sense
Be Damned(tm) - let's give them a chance to become martyrs...
