It doesn't matter which machine is chosen (the machine type only sets the
default alignments).  I believe the original problem is for System V.4 targets
(Linux ELF is a SVR4 target) in 2.7.2.3 did not set MAX_OFILE_ALIGNMENT, which
meant that the compiler assumed that the maximum alignment was 4 or 8 bytes.
Under 2.95 and beyond, the compiler knows you can specify higher alignments.
