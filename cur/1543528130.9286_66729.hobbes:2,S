At the moment, I have MPS set to 1.4 in the (latest QQ) BIOS. Linux claims to
find MPS 1.1, though. 
I had the same symptoms with MPS1.1 - I only set it to 1.4 to see if it would
help.
I'll update to 2.3.latest and try all combinations, including hard-coding USB 
to IRQ19 even when the kernel think it's on IRQ10, to see if that works.
