Jesse, have icplus agreed to sign the latest ip1000 gigabit driver?
I think that driver is more useful that this one (which in
fact seems to be duplicated from sundance from what i've read and
doesn't add anything new).
If i understand correctly, you (or any other person in icplus)
can confirm this by agreeing to the ip1000 inclusion in this list
and the current mantainers of the drivers (i think it was Francois
Romieu) can add the signed-off line and submit the driver.
Thanks,
