i wrote a simple simulator for eevdf. im not sure if i got it right though.
how does eevdf track the runtime usage of a process?
is it supposed to be like this?
int
tick()
{
    v_time += 1.0/sum_weights;
    current->runtime += 1.0/current->weight;
    //sched();
    time++;
    return 0;
}
i can forward the source to anyone who is willing to take a look.
Thanks.
