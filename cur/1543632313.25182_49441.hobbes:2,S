hi list,
what about the do_mmap/do_mmap_pgoff implementation?
reurn-type: _unsigned_ long	(which should be ok cause we've to return
				 an adress if len == 0)
on error: -ERR_*
and the checks in various places are really strange. - well some
places check for:
	o != NULL
	o > -1024UL
	o ...
guess this nedds some cleanup.
is it possible to have 0 as a valid address? - if not, this should
be the return on errors.
any comments?
