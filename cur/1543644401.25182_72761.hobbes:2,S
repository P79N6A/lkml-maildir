Only addressing spec bugs for now.
More comments tomorrow when I'm more awake.
section
3.1.1.1	"Table 2 takes a closer look at the fields...."
	No, it doesn't.
3.2.3	"The CONFIG_DRIVER_STATISTICS flag...."
	but section 5.1 calls it CONFIG_DRIVER_STATS.
3.3.2	"The CONFIG_DRIVER_STATISTICS build configuration option"
	should be CONFIG_DRIVER_DIAGNOSTICS
	and change "statistics support" to "diagnostics support"
3.4.2.7.3, example 2:  missing final '|' after "%s"
3.4.3.8.1, Comments on #defines:
	aren't several of these backwards?
3.4.3.8.3, last #define:  bad font change.
