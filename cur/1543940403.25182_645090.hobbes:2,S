Understood, and that makes tons of sense.

Well, I make no claim to understand the large batch systems you work on either ;)  Everything you said made a ton of sense other than the RT/load-balance thing, but I think we are on the same page now.

np (though I was wondering why you had no comment before ;)

Doh!  Thanks for the heads up.

I think we only need a plain-vanilla partition, so no flags should be necessary.
