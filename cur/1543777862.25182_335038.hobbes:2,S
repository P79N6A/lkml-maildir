Subject: [PATCH 2.6] I2C: Separate non-i2c hwmon drivers from i2c-core (4/9)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/19/124

All ISA hardware monitoring drivers (including hybrid drivers) now have
a hard dependency on i2c-isa, so they must select I2C_ISA. As a result,
CONFIG_I2C_ISA doesn't need to be left visible to the user. The good
thing here is that users will stop complaining that some driver doesn't
work just because they forgot to compile or load i2c-isa.
At this point, all drivers are working again and the cleanup phase can
begin.
