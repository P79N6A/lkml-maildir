There might be incompatibilites with the rest of the system. I'd advise
against it.
Why, in any case?

No way.

Just go slowly, read up on each configuration option (there is on-line help
in the configurators, e.g. "make menuconfig"), try it out and tweak from
there. A more knowledgeable person by your side the first time is very
useful...

against trying it if you don't know your way around (yet).
Good luck!
