Hi Bart
thanks for replying.
I was thinking functions calling the alloc_skb will not
consider the size of new variable which I will add, thats
why I thought of adding the size my self while allocating
space.
I am using kernel 2.6.3 and here are few line from skbuff.h

skBufId is the variable i added and I want to assign unique value
to this id whenever alloc_skb is called.
Do you think it will be fine to modify alloc_skb(..)
and just assigning a unique value to this new variable which I added
or will there be some side effects of this.
Thanks
