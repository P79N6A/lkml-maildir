Call it a bug in POSIX, if anything ;)
Remember that '..' is a directory entry in the filesystem, not a construct of 
your shell.  Specifically, it is a pointer to the parent directory of the 
directory in which it is found.
Usually /a/b/../c is the same as a/c, but not if /a/b is a symlink to /d as in 
this case.
