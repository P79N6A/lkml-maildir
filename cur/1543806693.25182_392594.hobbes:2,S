Also, the new PCI-ID policy is to put the defines in the driver  
itself, near where it is used, instead of collecting them in a single  
file.  The goal is to minimize the number of unused PCI IDs in the  
tree by keeping the definition near the usage.

had the best answer:
"Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems? They do  
it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they didn't.  
That's why I draw cartoons. It's my life."
