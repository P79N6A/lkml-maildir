It should be. I tried once more and noticed that
ata_acpi_handle_hotplug(...) is called when the cdrom is about to be
removed via the bay driver (just removing the device, not the whole dock
station). Actually there is a connection between the bay and the dock
driver, and one of them should notice that the cdrom/bay device is
dependent on the dock, but I don't know what's going wrong here. Kristen
(CC) should definitely know more about this interaction...
On a related note, shouldn't ata_acpi_handle_hotplug delete the device
like what is done when doing
  echo 1 > /sys/devices/.../block/sr0/device/delete
?
