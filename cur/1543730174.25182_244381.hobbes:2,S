Sorry I missed that one.  I'm surprised I did not get a reject
when I rebuilt that one against mm2.  It appears I was in a bit
of a rush.
Or why it would be nice for this code to be merged :)

Please just remove the previous patch and it's fix from your patchset,
as together they are a noop.
The following patch simply adds a shutdown method to the x86_64
i8259 code. That is what I care about in the context of kexec.
While testing this I found a minor ide bug. I will have a patch for
that in a second.
