Some synaptics touchpads can do palm detection in firmware, but the
software driver has to decide if the corresponding events shall be
ignored or not.
Anyway, this is unrelated to the patch. Without this patch, the packet
from the touchpad will be parsed incorrectly as a very big stick
motion, so a higher level driver (such as the X driver) can't really
see that there might be a palm touching the pad.
