unplug_io_fn was zero filled...RIP was 0, so I knew I was following a
bad function pointer, but the rest of the trace was just handle_mm_fault
and a few others leading to block_sync_page.  
Swap never showed in there, and I was a overly fixated on tracking down
someone calling lock_page without the inode pinned.  The good news is
that I'm now pretty sure we don't call lock_page without the inode
pinned ;-)
