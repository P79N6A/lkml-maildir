I think the problem is the fact that sed is trying to mmap
the file.  
This is from the strace before sed bombs out....
fstat(0, {st_mode=0, st_size=0, ...})   = 0
mmap(0, 0, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 0, 0) = 0
I am assuming that this is the expected behavior for such files.  
If you want to run sed on proc files just do 
cat /proc/modules | sed 
This will cause your shell to create a pipe using the pipe() system call
and dup2() this pipe to standard in where sed can then do it mmap() stuff.
BTW I'm not sure if sed is using mmap() directly or if it is coming from
the C library. I'd have to look at the source first.  (Which is hard to
get on the subway ;) )
