great! I'll put this into my patchkit!

yeah I'll take a look at this; some of the annotations are still a bit iffy in their placement

I've not seen this; I'll take another peak at the code.

I've considered having an option inside the code itself that would print a
backtrace for, say, an unknown latency larger than 100msec
but the code got ugly (the accounting gets done in the scheduler path,
where you can't printk).
I'll try again ;-)
