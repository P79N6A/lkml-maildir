Yes. On x86 (and x86-64) you'll never see this, because writes are always 
seen in order regardless, and in addition, the spin_lock is actually 
totally serializing anyway. On most other architectures, the spin_lock 
will serialize all the writes too, but it's not guaranteed, so in theory 
you're right. I suspect no actual architecture will do this, but hey, 
when talking memory ordering, safe is a lot better than sorry.
That said, since "task->state" in only tested _inside_ the runqueue lock, 
there is no race that I can see. Since we've gotten the runqueue lock in 
order to even check task-state, the processor that _sets_ task state must 
not only have done the "spin_lock()", it must also have done the 
"spin_unlock()", and _that_ will not allow either the timeout or the task 
state to haev leaked out from under it (because that would imply that the 
critical region leaked out too).
So I don't think the race exists anyway - the schedule() will return 
immediately (because it will see TASK_RUNNING), and we'll just retry.
