Looks like a merge error, causing that "internal.h" file to be included
twice. 
Alternatively, you're applying patches without "--fuzz=0", which allowed
Andrew's "git-nfs-build-fixes" patch to be applied wice.
In either case, it came from your tree, and had apparently never even
been compile-tested. 
Tssk, tssk..
