The system might be overrunning the number of requests the disk elevator 
has, which would result in the sort of disk seek storm you're seeing.  
Also, what filesystem is being used?  XFS would likely do substantially 
better than ext3 because of its use of extents vs indirect blocks.

No.  Readahead should be doing the right thing.  Rik van Riel did some 
work on drop behind for exactly this sort of case.

sendfile() uses the page cache directly, so it's like an mmap(), but it 
does not carry the overhead associated with tlb manipulation.

The kernel performs readahead using the system memory pool, which means 
the VM gets involved and performs page reclaim to free up previously 
cached pages.

Yes, this would be called a bug. =-)
