I've emailed them myself as this is the 2nd board I have with the HPT370
controller on it. HighPoint has not returned any of the 4 messages I've
sent to them in the last 3 months. I don't know what their plans are but I
do know I get the feeling they don't care to support Linux in any way
shape or form. Feels like a pawn off job.
