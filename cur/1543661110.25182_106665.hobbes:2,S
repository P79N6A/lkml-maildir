Make sure you get hid and mousedev loaded with the -pre4,
because 2.4.18-19 has autoload code which Vojtech rejected.
If the thing refuses to work with all modules loaded,
you can help by doing a patch bisection from the 2.4.18-19
SRPM and post results to the list. Actually, just try
taking out everything that has *usb* or *input* in the patch name.
