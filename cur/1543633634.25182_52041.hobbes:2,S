Actually, that doesn't matter, because it's a quickly convergent
operation.
Basically, once you've been invoked on a particular CPU once, you are
pretty much guaranteed to get invoked on that same CPU again, so the
fact that you may end up using a different buffer post-allocation is
not an issue.
Have an array and a semaphore called here allocation_semaphore:
/* PSEUDO-CODE */
while ( 1 ) {
      disable_preemption();
      cpu = current_cpu();
      if ( decompression_buffers[cpu] ) {
	 do_decompression(decompression_buffers[cpu]);
	 enable_preemption();
	 break;		/* DONE, EXIT LOOP */
      } else {
	 enable_preemption();
	 down_sem(allocation_semaphore);
	 /* Avoid race condition here */
	 if ( !decompression_buffers[cpu] )
	    decompression_buffers[cpu] = vmalloc(BUFFER_SIZE);
	 up_sem(allocation_semaphore);
      }
}
Note that there is no requirement that we're still on cpu "cpu" when
we allocate the buffer.  Furthermore, if we fail, we just loop right
back to the top.
