The kernel API should be stable enough, at least within stable trees.
Outside stable trees we should still maintain backward compatibility,
except when it comes to things which wouldn't work anyway (non-libc API
such as ipfw/ipchains/iptables etc).

They should not stop :-)
Adding things is another story.

I don't think so.
Applying a kernel patch usually doesn't change the API. Changing kernel
config should never change the API.

Things which are IMHO not options:
- removing kernel headers (i.e. headers which are required by kernel
  files to compile) from the kernel tree,
- duplicating kernel header definitions in external packages (a straight
  copy for distro users is ok, things which need maintenance aren't).
  Existing duplicates should be dealt with.
