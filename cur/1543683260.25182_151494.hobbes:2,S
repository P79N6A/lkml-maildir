I get this
kernel/built-in.o(.text+0x414e): In function `migration_call':
: undefined reference to `cpumask_of_cpu'
make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
diego@estel:~/kernel/unsta$ 
cpumask_of_cpu is not declared/used anywhere in the kernel (apart
of kernel/sched.c:2498, after applying bk2 + your patch)
