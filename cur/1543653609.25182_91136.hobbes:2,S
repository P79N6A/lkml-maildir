Well, this was put in to avoid all kind of garbage in the traces, so it 
shouldn't just go without replacement. Probably one could even get it

the core kernel as well).

I'll actually have to look into this. The script is probably fine.

Shouldn't be too hard.
Well, I know talk is cheap. I'll try to find some time to actually look
into some of these issues and come up with patches.
