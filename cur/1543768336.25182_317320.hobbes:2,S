Sorry for the late response. I was busy with some other projects.
AFAIK, there are basically two task properties that can affect its
long term CPU allocation: the nice value and the interactiveness. The
nice value affects the time slice value. The interactiveness affects
the time_slice recharge frequency (an interactive task doesn't expire
unless there's an ``expire_starving'').
Well, swap-sched doesn't affect a task's time_slice value, but it does
has impact on interactivity detection. Currently, Linux detects task
interactivity based on ``sleep_average''. With swap-sched, a task with
dependency will sleep less than it does in vanilla kernel. I am not
sure if ``different'' necessary means bad. But I am sure
swap-sched can be modified so that the dependency detection part will
work exactly the same way as vanilla kernel.
Best regards,
Haoqiang
