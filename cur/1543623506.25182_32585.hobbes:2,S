Sorry, I meant FUA, not WCE.  For this error I offer the apology that there
is a whole new set of TLA's to learn here, and I started yesterday.

That's my point all right.  And what I tried to say is, it's useless to
have it otherwise, so we should now start beating up drive makers to do it
this way (I don't think they'll need a lot of convincing actually) and we
should write a test procedure to determine which drives do it correctly,
according to our definition of correctness.  If we agree on what is
correct of course.
