ability to login != availability of free ptys.

Nope.
slogin someuser@someserver "/bin/bash -i"
will let you in even if you do not have a single pty free. Try it.
If course job control won't work and other minor things are there,
but still this is enough to e.g kill apache and all of its children in your case.
