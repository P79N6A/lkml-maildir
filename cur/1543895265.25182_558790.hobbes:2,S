Ok. Well, the lockup is all to real here :p
I suspect a memory corruption going on, as under certain circumstances
there is printed more after the "agpgart: Detected an Intel 965G
Chipset." -- that is, the kernel *sometimes* doesn't hang silently,
but either reboots by itself (hard reset) or prints something
that looks like a total crash to me. Often, this is prefixed by
the name of running process. I am sorry, I never wrote any of that
down. Only the last time, it then went like:
agpgart: Detected an Intel 965G Chipset.
modprobe: Corrupt page table at address 20
PGD 178c6c067 PUD 201000c0049c04f BAD
This very same kernel (I boot it several times to see how
reproducable things were) always prints "agpgart: Detected an Intel 965G
Chipset." but then either hangs (two times), prints the above
and hangs (one time) or hard resets (one time).
Then I also booted the other kernels several times, and kernels
that booted fine ALWAYS boot fine - while kernels that locked
up (that I tested by booting them three times) only printed
the agpgart line and locked up three times.

I hope you saw my later post too? I sent it to you too - but also to the
list, so I don't know if you'll notice it.
The Subject of that post is: 2.6.22-rc5 regression
I concluded too soon that 2.6.22-rc5 was working :(.
I just really tested it and it doesn't! Same error.
Please have a look at that other post of me and lets continue this
thread there.

I'll add that to that other thread.
