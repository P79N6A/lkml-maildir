Well, I've used up all available space so it depends on whether we want to
change the size of struct acct.

Sounds good, but before forming an opinion about a variable struct acct
size, I'd like to look into the userspace tools to learn more about the
implications of it.
For one thing, it makes seeking in the accounting file impossible.
A solution to this might be to extend the struct to multiples of 64 bytes
and have special markers at the positions where ac_version might be looked 
for.
