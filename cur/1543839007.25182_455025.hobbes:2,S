Jens, I'm hoping you can clear something up for me.
ll_rw_blk.c:
void blk_rq_bio_prep(request_queue_t *q, struct request *rq, struct
bio *bio)
{
        /* first three bits are identical in rq->flags and bio->bi_rw
	*/
        rq->flags |= (bio->bi_rw & 7);
That was recently changed to be the first 2 bits not 3.  But it made
me look.
/*
 * bio bi_rw flags
 *
 * bit 0 -- read (not set) or write (set)
 * bit 1 -- rw-ahead when set
 * bit 2 -- barrier
 * bit 3 -- fail fast, don't want low level driver retries
 * bit 4 -- synchronous I/O hint: the block layer will unplug immediately
 */
#define BIO_RW          0
#define BIO_RW_AHEAD    1
#define BIO_RW_BARRIER  2
#define BIO_RW_FAILFAST 3
#define BIO_RW_SYNC     4
/*
 * first three bits match BIO_RW* bits, important
 */
enum rq_flag_bits {
        __REQ_RW,               /* not set, read. set, write */
        __REQ_FAILFAST,         /* no low level driver retries */
        __REQ_SORTED,           /* elevator knows about this request
	*/
The first bit matches.  The second doesn't (BIO_RW_AHEAD vs
__REQ_FAILFAST).  And obviously you just fixed the third bit.
Should BIO_RW_FAILFAST == __REQ_FAILFAST instead?
Thanks,
Matt
