Sure, IS_ROOT() only tells you whether a dentry is connected to its parent
and to tell if its connected to the fs root you need to traverse all the
parents.  But nfsd_acceptable() already does this to do permission checks
in the (default) subtree_check case.
So it seems that what the flag gives you is that when its absent and
nosubtree_check is in effect, you know you can short-circuit the connection
walk.  Fair enough.
