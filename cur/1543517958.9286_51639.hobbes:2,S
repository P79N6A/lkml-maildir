[here it goes, with a possible foot in the mouth ;-)]
Uh, how ?
The header files needs to include for module compilation is identical
for both open source and binary only modules.
Seems like a strawman argument.
Plus code changes that affect modules seems pretty minimal across kernel
revisions. I'm not an authority about this.

Well, they're alot slower only in different circumstances for reason not
relevant to binary-only module support.
Sounds like another strawman argument here.
