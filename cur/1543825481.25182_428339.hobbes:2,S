We are in set_page_dirty and this would be part of set_page_dirty 
processing.

Its bad but the out of space situation is an exceptional situation. We do 
similar contortions when we run out of memory space. As I said: One can 
track down the processes that have dirtied the pte to the page in question 
and just terminate those and remove the page.

Adds yet another method with functionality that for the most part 
is the same as set_page_dirty().
The advantage of such a method seems to be that it reserves filesystem 
space for pages that could potentially be written to. This allows the 
filesystem to accurately deal with out of space situations (a very rare 
condition. Is this really justifiable?). Maybe having already reserved 
space could speed up the real dirtying of pages?
