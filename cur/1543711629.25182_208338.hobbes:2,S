I do think that we should introduce a "map_dma_coherent()" thing, which 
basically takes a list of pages that have been allocated by 
dma_alloc_coherent(), and remaps them into user space. How hard can that 
be?
In fact, on a lot of architectures (well, at least x86, and likely
anything else that doesn't use any IOTLB and just allocates a chunk of
physical memory), I think the "map_dma_coherent()" thing should basically
just become a "remap_page_range()". Ie something like
	#define map_dma_coherent(vma, vaddr, len) \
		remap_page_range(vma, vma->vm_start, __pa(vaddr), len, vma->vm_page_prot)
for the simple case.
Ehh?
