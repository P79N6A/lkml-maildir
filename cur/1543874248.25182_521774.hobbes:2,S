I agree with David and Jessie.
All the kernel needs to know for oopses is frame buffer depth, start,
stride, and how to get the GPU to "stop" (or it may very well overwrite
the screen).  Trying to get back to a default mode setting first in the
middle of oopsing is very unlikely to succeed.
The time you want mode switching (or lack othereof) is at suspend/resume
time, not at oopses.
This presumes the frame buffer is accessible in the address space of the
kernel.  There have been display devices where this is not true; but not
many.
