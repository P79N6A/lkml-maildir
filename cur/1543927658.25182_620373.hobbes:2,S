You mean runtime (AKA dynamic) suspend -- autosuspend is merely one
type of runtime suspend.

The nomenclature du jour is just plain "suspend" for suspend-to-RAM and
"hibernation" for suspend-to-disk.

Correct.

Usually, not but always!  Some Macs have been known to keep USB suspend 
current available during hibernation.

There are no rules set in stone.  :-)
Systems are _supposed_ to keep the ports powered during suspend, but
some may fail to do so.  It depends on the firmware (i.e., BIOS for
PCs) and the motherboard design.

This is explained in Documentation/usb/power-management.txt.  If the
USB Persist facility has been enabled for a device then reset_resume
will be called, to indicate that the device had to be reset as part of
the resume procedure.  If USB Persist isn't enabled then the disconnect
method will be called and the device will be re-enumerated, exactly as
though it had been unplugged and then plugged back in.
