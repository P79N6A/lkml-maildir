Today I do a measurable about it. 
First I using 2.6.12 without dynamic enable and unplug the AC power,
I check the /proc/pmu/battery_0, like this.
--
 flags      : 00000011
 charge     : 907
 max_charge : 2863
 current    : -987
 voltage    : 10950
 time rem.  : 3600

I only intresting with current, that show the system power load. 
When I enable dynamic, The current can low at -900.
So, It works. :>
2.6.12 + suspend2 + ck3 + dynamic
