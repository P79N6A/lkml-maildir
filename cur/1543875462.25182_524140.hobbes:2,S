I incorrectly described the locking, I think.
A cpusets reference count increases if either another task is attached
to it, or if a task already attached forks.
If we decrement to zero the count, we -know- that no more tasks are
attached to it.
If we hold the cpuset manage_mutex, then we -know- that attach_task can't
attach tasks to it.
But now that you mention it, that additional atomic_read of the count in
check_for_release() seems suspicious to me.  I'm afraid that the following
could happen:
    1) given cpusets A and A/B, with a single task attached to A (none to B)
    2) some other tasks issues a "rmdir A/B"
    3) near the end of the cpuset_rmdir() code, after we have removed A/B, we
	invoke check_for_release()
    4) just at that instant, the single task in A exits, decrementing the
	count on A to zero
    5) both the exiting task and the task doing the rmdir execute the
	cpuset_release_agent() and check_for_release() code.
Aha - yes, maybe that could happen, but it is OK !!
Multiple tasks all pounding on the same cpuset with this release logic
is not a problem. That just ends up being multiple tasks doing a 'rmdir'
on that cpuset from user space.  At most one of them succeeds in
removing the directory, and if it is removed, then the remaining get an
error that there is no such directory.
The race I worried about in last nights post is NOT a problem:

This is one of the advantages of not actually unlinking cpusets at this point,
when it seems they are no longer used.  We just fire off a user mode helper
thread to attempt a subsequent removal.  That separate thread will get the locking
correct, from the top down, and if the cpuset is still really and truly unused,
then and only then actually remove it.
Simultaneous spurious check_for_release() calls are not a problem!
