I noticed that the MMX libraries seem tied to CYRIX and AMD builds 
in the config scripts.  I am wondering if MMX support for Intel 
is not supported in 2.4.X kernels except for these processor types.
The code appears to be usable on Intel.
Can someone clarify the MMX support for kernel code in the 
current 2.4.X trees and how extensive it is for Intel?
Thanks
Jeff
