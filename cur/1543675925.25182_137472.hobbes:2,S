Sigma designs are known to not cooperate very well with open source
projects.  Actually, it's quite the contrary.  Some time ago they
released the XVID mpeg4 codec as their own, without source code.
I have heard of people trying to get documentation from them, but I
don't think anyone ever succeeded.
