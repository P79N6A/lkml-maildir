Seems that the codes for the numbers are the same which is probvlematic
for me.  I mapped those keys as the keys in the "numlock-area" of the
keyboard.  I did it because I have a azerty-keyboard layout (be-latin1),
if I press the numbers it gives now &,é,",',(,§,... I also mapped the
numlock-button on the 'rename'-button right under the '7'-button (cfr.
ASCII-thingie in source).  This way I could them use as numbers and as
Home,PgUp,PgDn,Arrows... though I mapped those on ther keys too.
I think it will need 2 different tables thus :|  Maybe some other codes
are used twice now ... for other keys, I don't know as I didn't test it
alot and didn't look up in the source.
friendly greeting,
Karel "scapor" Demeyer
