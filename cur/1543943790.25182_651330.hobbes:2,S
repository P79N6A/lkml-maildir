I really don't care whether they get merges as one or separately, but I 
think it should be merged _now_ (-rc1 is already delayed), and I'd like to 
see the final versions of both. Does anybody have them in a final 
agreed-upon format (preferably with that oddness in quirk_intel_irqbalance 
also fixed?)
