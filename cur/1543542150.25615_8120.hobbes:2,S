I've been trying to figure out how to move execs away from the default loading location and while I'm OK with the .text, I have come to the conclusion that ld.so cannot be dislodged from 0x40000000 as this must be the TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE thrown up by demand-paging/mmap. 
Can anyone confirm or refute this conclusion?
The reason it is of interest to me is that I want to grab as much contiguous vm as I can, and 0x400000000 rather iritatingly bisects the available vm space. 
By the way is there a better forum for kernel related programming questions? I often see references to linux-kernel-programming but I gather that it is defunct. 
Thanks ...
