Odd? It works, has to: It's part of ANSI C. It is implemented by giving the
function a (hidden) pointer to a struct to be filled in, so this is much
slower than just stuffing a value into a register and returning.  Plus it
won't work for syscalls with their arguments in registers, for obvious
reasons. Check this out (i686, RH 6.9.5 using kgcc and gcc give right
results):
#include <stdio.h>
struct s {
   int error, result;
};
struct s f();
main()
{
   struct s x = {0, 0};
   
   x = f();
   printf("error: %d, result: %d\n", x.error, x.result);
}
struct s f()
{
   struct s xx;
   
   xx.error = 1;
   xx.result = 117;
   return xx;
}
