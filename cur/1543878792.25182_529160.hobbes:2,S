    I'm seeing this while booting:
ima (ima_init): No TPM chip found(rc = -19), activating TPM-bypass!

[ BUG: held lock freed! ]
-------------------------
swapper/1 is freeing memory c04c7660-c04c76a3, with a lock still held there!

1 lock held by swapper/1:
 #0:  (ima_queue_lock){--..}, at: [<c0202710>] ima_create_htable+0x10/0x90

 =======================
    I saw this in -rc5-mm4 also.
    I couldn't find a contact address in MAINTAINERS, so I've CC'd the
two authors listed on top of ima_create_htable.c , as well as the
first submitter of the IMA stuff I found in my LKML archive.
    As an aside, this computer does have (some sort of) TPM chip, but
the driver is built as a module, and not loaded at this point (not a
worry for me, I don't intend to use it).
