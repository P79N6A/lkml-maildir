Well, per my other email, i found a case where the bios DID matter.  Yes, the AC21600H supports DMA.  Even my dinosaur 850 meg in that same box, works in dma mode, and does get a little bit faster.  They're so slow in the first place
that it doesn't make much transfer rate difference, but the cpu load goes way down.
