I'm not responsible for microarchitecture designer stupidity.
If a simple STORE assembler instruction will eat up 4000 clock cycles,
as you say here, well, I think all we Computer Scientists can go home and
give it up now.

Please, return to the fact.
Modifying the page contents is done by that part of benchmark application we
are not misuring.
That is, the code ***BEFORE*** the zc_send() (write() on pipe or whatever
you choose)
and ***AFTER*** a zc_receive() (or read() from pipe ot whatever else).
This is nice, thanks, but out of our interests.
We are only reading the relocation tables or inserting new entries in it.
Not modifying page contents.

Ok. Simply, this is not the case in my experiment.
This does not apply.
We have no threads. But only detached process address spaces.
Threads are a bit different from processes.
> why would you need a global lock for copying memory ?
System call sys_write() calls
locks_verify_area() which calls
locks_mandatory_area() which calls
lock_kernel()
oops...
global spin_lock locking...
SMP is crying...
But not so much, if the lock is not lasting much, is it right?
THIS IS NOT WHAT WE CALL A SHORT LOCK SECTION:
732 repeat:
733         /* Search the lock list for this inode for locks that conflict
with
734          * the proposed read/write.
735          */
736         for (fl = inode->i_flock; fl != NULL; fl = fl->fl_next) {
737                 if (!(fl->fl_flags & FL_POSIX))
738                         continue;
739                 if (fl->fl_start > new_fl->fl_end)
740                         break;
741                 if (posix_locks_conflict(new_fl, fl)) {
742                         error = -EAGAIN;
743                         if (filp && (filp->f_flags & O_NONBLOCK))
744                                 break;
745                         error = -EDEADLK;
746                         if (posix_locks_deadlock(new_fl, fl))
747                                 break;
748
749                         error = locks_block_on(fl, new_fl);
750                         if (error != 0)

S_ISGID)
758                                 break;
