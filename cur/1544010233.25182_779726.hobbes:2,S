Looks good.
But.... If we never actually need fast access to the approximate
total, (which seems to apply to this and the previous patch) we
could use something much simpler which does not have the spinlock
or all this batching stuff that percpu counters have. I'd prefer
that because it will be faster in a straight line...
(BTW. percpu counters can't be used in interrupt context? That's
nice.)
