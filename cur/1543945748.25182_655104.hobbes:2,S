Hi,
Has anyone managed to build this as a module against the full 2.6.24 
release ?
I am seeing the following error:
   CC [M]  lib/zlib_inflate/infutil.o
   CC [M]  lib/zlib_inflate/inftrees.o
   CC [M]  lib/zlib_inflate/inflate_syms.o
   LD [M]  lib/zlib_inflate/zlib_inflate.o
   Building modules, stage 2.
   MODPOST 251 modules
ERROR: "geode_mfgpt_toggle_event" [drivers/watchdog/geodewdt.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "geode_mfgpt_alloc_timer" [drivers/watchdog/geodewdt.ko] undefined!
make[1]: *** [__modpost] Error 1
make: *** [modules] Error 2
arch/x86/kernel/mfgpt_32.c where these are defined seems to have been 
built ok and they appear in System.map.
The only other thing I've done is to add "[PATCH] pata_cs5536 Fix 
secondary port configuration" recently posted by Martin K. Petersen but 
I don't believe that would cause this.
.config is available at
