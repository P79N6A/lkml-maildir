Well... I was wondering that myself, whether this race should even
happen.  But the bottom of do_unlinkat looks like:
        mutex_unlock(&nd.dentry->d_inode->i_mutex);
        if (inode)
                iput(inode);    /* truncate the inode here */
exit1:
        path_release(&nd);
exit:
        putname(name);
        return error;
so I think it's possible that link can sneak in there & find it after
the mutex is dropped...?  Is this ok? :)  It's certainly -happening-
anyway....
