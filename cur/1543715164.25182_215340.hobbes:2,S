My Compaq presario 700EA locks up dead during boot with
ACPI enabled. With bootoption acpi=off (or not compiled into the kernel)
the machine works just fine.
I put on acpi debug and typed over by hand (laptop's dont have serial
ports these days anymore) :
ACPI: Subsystem revision 20040326
tbxface-0017[03] acpi_load_tables: ACPI tables succesfully acquired
Parsing all Control Methods: [......]
Table [DSDT] (id F005) - 433 Objects with 44 Devices 109 Methods 15
Regions
Parsing all Control Methods: 
Table [SSDT] (id f003) - 3 objects with 0 Devices 0 Methods 0 Regions
ACPI: IRQ10 SCI: Edge set to level trigger
After this the machine is dead in the water.
No magic sysrq or anything.
Any ideas how to solve this issue ?
I googled around a bit but found nothing usefull.
I upgraded bios to latest available from compaq, with no different
results.
Help/suggestions appreciated.
Danny
