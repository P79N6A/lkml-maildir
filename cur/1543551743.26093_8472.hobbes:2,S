After sending my last email to the list, I switched to tty1, and
could not type, I got the following in my syslog, and dumped to
the screen.

Switching consoles, and hitting random keys for a few seconds got
me back.  Definitely not a hardware problem.  Must be a bug in
the keyboard driver, or tty code.  This is a stock unpatched
kernel.

[Favorite quotes of Linus Torvalds - Sept 6, 2000]
I'm a bastard. I have absolutely no clue why people can ever think
otherwise. Yet they do. People think I'm a nice guy, and the fact is that
I'm a scheming, conniving bastard who doesn't care for any hurt feelings
or lost hours of work if it just results in what I consider to be a better
system.  And I'm not just saying that. I'm really not a very nice person. 
I can say "I don't care" with a straight face, and really mean it.
