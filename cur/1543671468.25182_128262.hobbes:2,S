Wouldn't you still want to import "old" data into the new BetterApp?
Changes of the format or interface are painful, we've seen this with the
network filtering in Linux several times, 2.0 had ipfwadm, 2.2 had
ipchains, 2.4 has compatibility interfaces for either and its native
netfilter... There must have been a better reason to add compatibility
than just "because we could do it."
