Presumably some access that the CPU is doing to the controller has timed 
out and caused the MCE. It might be useful if we could get a stack trace 
from where the MCE was triggered - does anyone know if it's possible to 
do this?
It's possible that only NVidia really could tell why this error would 
result from a disk problem, though.
