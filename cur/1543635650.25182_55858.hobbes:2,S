In the load path there are more races. Read access to the module list is
only protected by the BKL. This makes it possible to create multiple
modules with the same name in sys_create_module (module_map() can sleep).

normal cases or simple cases? The filesystem interface is a very simple
one, now e.g. add a proc interface to it. The current module interface
requires that any first reference to a module must be protected against
module load/unload and unregister, what requires two locks. It could be
reduced to a single lock, if the module was allowed to let the unload
fail, because there are still users. The module actually knows best,
whether there are still references to the module, but it can't tell that
the kernel.
