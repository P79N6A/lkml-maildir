Replying to myself... and definitely not the best way for 2.5
(would be ok for 2.4 but do we care at this point ?)
Instead, we'd rather add the EDID as an attribute of the fb
to sysfs.
Actually, I suggest that each fbdev driver defines ones or more
nodes in sysfs below the actual driver node, representing the
various heads. Each head would then have attributes representing
the various display properties, one beeing the EDID block.
