SO? That's actually the case. So it's confusing. So you're confusing
people even more by telling nothing. Great. 
#define LARGE_NUMBER 100000
out->total_inodes = fs->oids_in_use + LARGE_NUMBER; 
if (out->total_inodes < fs->oids_in_use) 
   out -> total_inods = MAXINT;
out -> free_inodes = LARGE_NUMBER; 
Three lines of code fixes that.

Fine, introduce a new interface. But report as much as you can on the
old interface. Remember you can read/write/seek files using the 32bit
interface even though the new (seek-, and stat-) interface uses 64
bits.
