Aha! I just remembered what would happen...
The problem stopped when I got a 10/100mbit fdx switch ... Prior, when i
had only a 10mbs hub it appeared as though the increase in net activity
would cause the nic to want to go into 100mbit mode (even though the hub
could not support it) .. This would give *something wicked*. When i
would unplug the cable from the nic/wait a sec/ and put it back in - it
would work again...
