When the machine hangs in graphical mode its quite hard to get the data
out - one of the long term todo items is to fix that.
Boot the machine and leave it in text mode (or if it boots to graphical
mode then switch to a text console/text mode) and wait.. with "luck" it
will show the same problem in text mode and give you a meaningful screen
dump you can then write down (or grab with a digital camera)
