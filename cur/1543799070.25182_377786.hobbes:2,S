Actually, no.  My test is to do a make install over NFS of a kernel that
has already been built.
The times I'm getting for the SLAB is ~26 seconds, the time for the SLOB
is 1 minute 32 seconds.  So your looking at >300% slowness here.  The test
bed is a UP.  (I do that first before looking into SMP).
I'm still trying to keep the SLOB simple.  It's the lack of sleep that is
making it hard ;)
