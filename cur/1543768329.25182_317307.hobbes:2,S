I wonder if this problem might benifit from the "breakpoint on write" capability 
in kgdb.  If you are using the kgdb in the mm patch, look in 
Documentation/i386/kgdb/gdbinit.hw at the hwwbrk macro.  You will, of course, 
have to source this file from gdb to load the macro.  Then you can use the gdb 
command: help hwwbrk to get info on how to use it.
If the location is not written to too often this should help find the offender.
