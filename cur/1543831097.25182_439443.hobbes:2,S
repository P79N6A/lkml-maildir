I just tested both approaches separately. If I leave the STAT_THRESHOLD at 
32 and just add the STAT_THRESHOLD / 2 trick we can scale cleanly up to 
160p in the synthetic test.
I have a bad feeling though for 512p 1024p and 4096p with the static 
approach with STAT_THRESHOLD /2 but it will take some time to get tests 
done on those.
I think the best right now is to just take the dynamic threshold patch. I 
expect that to do just fine at the higher numbers. If we have more trouble 
at 1024p then maybe try STAT_THRESHOLD/2 before going to 
aggregate counter consolidation.
