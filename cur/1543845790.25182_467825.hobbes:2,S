Tridge: *you* also chose deliberately to use the GPL which explicitely
allows other people to do so. You could have written "the latest
version of the GPL as released by the FSF" or used a licence similar
to the GPLv2 with the permission to restrain the licence removed.
Moreover, anyone can add a patch released under the GPLv2 only (this
is their right, morally and technically) to a copy of your software;
after that, they have no choice but to redistribute the whole as GPLv2
only (I insist on "the whole", of course they might keep the "or later"
on your individual files).
