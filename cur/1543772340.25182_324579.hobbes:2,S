Howdy,
I cannot find the ATA passthru or SMART option in the 2.6.11.10 kernel anywhere near
the SCSI or ATA .  Is it somewhere obscure, has it been renamed, or am I looking in
totally the wrong place? (e.g. is this an option when building hdparm or something?)
Rob.

You need "ATA passthru" (SMART support) in order for hdparm to work.
