No. Our kernels are configurable, so you can select what components
you want to have in your kernel. It is something that predates
modules. [So yes, even if ext2 is normally compiled into kernel, I can
select in config that I want it out, or I can select that I want it as
module. Please retain same options for xfs.]
And you definitely _do_ want XFS compiled into kernel, because fs for
your / partition has to be compiled in. It would be very bad if I had
to have small ext2 partition there just for insmoding xfs, what do you
think?
