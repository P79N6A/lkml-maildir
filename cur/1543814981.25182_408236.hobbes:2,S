Even a desktop running with these settings is so interactive that I
could play a game of Maelstrom (asteroids like thing) while doing a make
-j30 in slow nfs mount and barely feel it.  In a local filesystem, I
could't feel it at all, so I added a thud 3, irman2 and a bonnie -s 2047
for good measure.  Try that with stock :)
