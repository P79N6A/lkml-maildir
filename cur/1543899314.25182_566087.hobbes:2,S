There may be people whose jobs entail continually suspecting
performance problems.  Or one may run instrumentation code on a
long-term basis specifically to locate performance spikes.

There is a big difference in favour of the former.  The additional
instrumentation code may be small enough to inspect carefully.  The
rest of the kernel would be unaffected.

Agreed.
