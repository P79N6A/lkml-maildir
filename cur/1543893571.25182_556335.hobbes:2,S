thanks! Here's another thing that would be worth testing:
could you pin the CPU's frequency to the highest setting (via whatever 
method of your choice, by selecting the 'performance' cpufreq governor 
for example). Plus could you do a test with the following additional 
kernel boot parameter: idle=poll. [both changes would exclude TSC 
related artifacts.] (This would be for testing only, to narrow down the 
regression.)
