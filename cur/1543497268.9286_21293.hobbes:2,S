Actually, the Amiga's downfall was due to the dunderheads at Commodore,
more that anything that Microsoft might have done.  They squandered the
money and then shafted the people who wanted to take the
product/technology and do something worth while. 
The Amiga still exists today (Amiga International) as well as a few
companies who have bought parts of the technology and will most likely
use it for TV-set top boxes or imbedded video controller devices.
Today's Amiga, however, is PowerPC based and almost nothing like the
original Amigas (which is sad). 
The Amiga's OS was very compact and extremely modular.  It's ashame the
code was never made Open Source as many people could benefit from its
elegent design and implementation.

Actually, NT's *design* was very much based on a microkernel design (with
components of VMS injected into it for good measure).  Sadly, due to
practical constraints, the *implementation* deviated from the design.
