I'd like to find a way to prevent that instead.  There's got to be a way.
It's easy to prevent irman type things from starving others permanently (i 
call this active starvation, or wakeup starvation), and this does something 
fairly similar to what you're talking about.  Just crawl down the queue 
heads looking for the oldest task periodically instead of always taking the 
highest queue.  You can do that very fast, and it does prevent active 
starvation.
