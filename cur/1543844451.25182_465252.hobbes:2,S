Do you mean using the asm to make sure gcc puts a reference to a 
variable into the DWARF info, or some other way of encoding the value 
locations?
Hm, another problem.  If the mark is in a loop, and gcc decides to 
unroll the loop, then you'll probably only get a mark in one iteration 
of the loop (or 1/Nth of the iterations).  Or worse, assembler errors.  
The only way I can see to deal with this is to not use symbols, but put 
records in a special section.  That way, if the asm() inserting them 
gets duplicated, you'll get duplicate records in the marker section.
I guess you'd get a similar problem with markers inserted in inlined 
functions.
(How does gdb deal with breakpoints in unrolled loops?)
