this is the relevent (as far as i know) section of my .config i'm using now.
CONFIG_HPET_TIMER=y
CONFIG_X86_PM_TIMER=y
# CONFIG_HPET_EMULATE_RTC is not set
CONFIG_RTC=y
# CONFIG_HPET is not set
Now, there is no option in menuconfig for choosing pm timer, so i take 
it that the config option here compiles it in. Note, ACPI is also 
compiled in, without any apm code so acpi is enabled, as is apic.
This is my dmesg output.
Feb  3 16:22:49 psuedomode kernel: ACPI: PM-Timer IO Port: 0x4008
Feb  3 16:22:49 psuedomode kernel: time.c: Using 1.193182 MHz PIT timer.
Feb  3 16:22:49 psuedomode kernel: time.c: Using PIT/TSC based timekeeping.
So what happened to the pm timer.  I used to use the pm timer when i was 
using older kernels, 2.6.14.3'ish.
