What makes you say no needed purpose?  I agree it's screwed in 2.5,
but its purpose is to make more memory available to the OOMkilled task,
so it's not held up on its way out to freeing memory: seems reasonable.
I'm no great lover of PF_MEMDIE and PF_ flag manipulation, but let it
live until we have an alternative?  I think the better patch is not
to lose PF_MEMDIE (and conceivably others) once it has been set.
(Shall we agree to turn a blind eye to the risk of oom_kill_task
manipulating p->flags while it may be another CPU's current->flags?)
