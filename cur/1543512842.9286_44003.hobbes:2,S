        I hate to jump on the bandwagon and say that 'it works for me', but It 
does indeed work for me. I'm using xterm, pl108, and rxvt. Dist is Slackware 
4.0. just opened up 16 xterms, 4 rxvt windows, logged out, or forcibly killed 
them all, started a new xterm (these are all compiled with PTY support), and 
got pts/0.
