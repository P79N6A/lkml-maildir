Specweb96 is about as relevant to real world web performance as the colour
of car you own. And in this case massively so. Run your test with thttpd.
Your run queue length will be _one_. Always one, never more and under load
never less. Its an architectural issue in your web server.
Specweb99 which does at least pretend to be a credible benchmark you would
see more running because of your cgis, although in most real world cases your
cgi will be short lived, and if performance critical be a module in your
web server so not more threads.
