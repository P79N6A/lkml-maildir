That's not good.
If the program says '100ms' because it knows it will need to do a GUI update
then, and you block it for 5 seconds because that's when the next value
update happens, the user is stuck looking at their gkrellm or whatever not
doing anything at all for 4.9 seconds....
This almost forces the use of multiple threads if the program wants to do
its own timer management.
