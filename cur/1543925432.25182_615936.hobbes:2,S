They _are_ different in the real world...  that's why
	make ARCH=i386
is so often used.

Or the short and straightforward
	make ARCH=x86_64
to do the same thing (and incidentally what we've been doing up until 
this point).
Don't get so hung up on "architecture" and actually look at what people 
do _today_.
All other solutions proposed are simply _longer_ ways to do exact the 
same thing.  "more work for same outcome" isn't optimal.
