Most groups use -rc release candidate releases, so using that instead of
-pre-final would lead to the least confusion.
A 2.4.17 release might look like this:
Release 2.4.17-preX until all the new stuff you want is in.
Release 2.4.17-rcX until no-one complains about the new stuff.
Release the last 2.4.17-rcX as 2.4.17 and hope no one finds anything
embarassing (which will probably happen anyway.
Seems to me though, that you can simply put a note in your Changelog which
-pre releases are bound to be to the next final revision, this will save us
from yet another numbering scheme.
