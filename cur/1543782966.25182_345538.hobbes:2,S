I have the same problem since linux-2.6.x  Linux-2.4.20 and on
had no problem with Hyper-Threading. My startup says:
CPU: Hyper-Threading is disabled.  There is no enable/disable
in the BIOS so I don't know what to do. It's an Intel D865PERL
Motherboard so certainly Intel should know how to enable their CPUs.
