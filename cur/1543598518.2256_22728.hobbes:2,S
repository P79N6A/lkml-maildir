Hi Justin,
The Linux SCSI device quirks table can be found in scsi_scan.c. :-)
It does not allow to limit tagged command queue depth, but only to disable
this feature using the BLIST_NOTQ flag. Adding an upper limit seems
feasible without too large a change. Low level drivers (SIMs) could then
access this information when called for select_queue_depth(), or the SCSI
layer could just lowered the value to this upper limit for each device.
And for the filling of such a new quirks table, you might just get the
data for the FreeBSD cam_xpt.c file you know very well. :-)
Historically, the tagged command queueing feature has been kind of
nightmare under Linux and low-level drivers that supported this feature
used to default to a safe value for the command queue depth.
The ncr53c8xx and sym53c8xx drivers defaulted and still default to 8
commands per LUN. This has been proven to work reasonnably even with well
known broken firmware. Some other drivers just defaulted to no tag.
Without some handling of appropriate quirks per device regarding tagged
command queue depth, it is not reasonnable, in my opinion, to default to
something larger that 8 commands per lun under current Linux.
My feeling, and somehow experience, is that not reusing tag numbers too
quickly prevents from triggerring races in broken firmwares. This has been
the reason I implemented a circular tag number allocation sheme in the
ncr53c8xx and sym53c8xx drivers and this seemed to have had the expected
effects.
Regards,
  Gérard.
PS1: By the way, I do agree with your analysis of the problem.
PS2: Thanks a lot for all your efforts for SCSI in free O/Ses.
