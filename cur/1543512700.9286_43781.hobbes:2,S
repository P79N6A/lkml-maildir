The problem has already been fixed in binutils 2.9.5.0.16, which I
downloaded a couple of hours ago. Using this fixes all but of the
assembler errors in arch/i386/boot/bootsect.S. (The one error it does
not fix is the one at line 404 where an "outw" should be an "outb" as
mentioned before in this list)
