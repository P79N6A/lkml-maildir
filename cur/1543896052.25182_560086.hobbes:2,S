They may never reach critical mass, as GNU/Linux already crossed that border.  
Their only hope may possibly be a drop-in kernel replacement to leverage the 
vast availability of GNU/Linux distributions.
So what's this got to do with the GPLv2/v3 debate?  It's the seemingly fair 
GPLv2 that was possibly instrumental in growing this large GNU/Linux 
community, and changing this fairness by hampering parties to enter this 
community may well be counterproductive.
Thanks!
