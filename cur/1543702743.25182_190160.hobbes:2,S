What is 3c575_cs ?  I think you actually mean 3c574_cs.  Or maybe you
mean you have a 3com 3ccfe575 Cardbus card?  The above is rather too
ambiguous.

This indicates that the card you inserted is a Cardbus card.  In which
case, the PCMCIA driver "3c574_cs" is definitely not what you want.
You want to use the 3c59x driver, though the hotplug subsystem should
automatically pick that up from the PCI ids.
Could you insert the card, and then provide the output of lspci -vx ?
