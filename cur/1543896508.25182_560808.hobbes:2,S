damn, i first wrote up an explanation about why that ugly __delay(1) is 
there (it almost hurts my eyes when i look at it!) but then deleted it 
as superfluous :-/
really, it's not because i'm stupid (although i might still be stupid 
for other resons ;-), it wasnt there in earlier spin-debug versions. We 
even had an inner spin_is_locked() loop at a stage (and should add it 
again).
the reason for the __delay(1) was really mundane: to be able to figure 
out when to print a 'we locked up' message to the user. If it's 1 
second, it causes false positive on some systems. If it's 10 minutes, 
people press reset before we print out any useful data. It used to be 
just a loop of rep_nop()s, but that was hard to calibrate: on certain 
newer hardware it was triggering as fast as in 2 seconds, causing many 
false positives. We cannot use jiffies nor any other clocksource in this 
debug code.
so i settled for the butt-ugly but working __delay(1) thing, to be able 
to time the debug messages.
