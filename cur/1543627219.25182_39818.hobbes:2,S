you are supposing that I load md modules and raid module together, mostly
during boot with initrd. In the reality I have some servers with more that
200 days of uptime, and I have to change external disks sometime. I do
usually have two external boxes, and something like 8/20 disks (two scsi
controllers),  and different raid on different disks. You see, it is not
that easy.
