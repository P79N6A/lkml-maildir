Subject: [PATCH] timer: Add an initial 0.5s delay to calc_load
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This adds an initial 0.5s delay to calc_load so that it avoids updating 
load at the same time as tasks scheduled using round_jiffies, otherwise 
the load average is badly affected by tasks that run every time calc_load 
does (currently every 5s).
I'm assuming this change doesn't affect the intention of round_jiffies, 
to avoid tasks waking the cpu at different times, because calc_load is 
already run very often by a call from update_times(ticks) on every timer 
interrupt.

Without this change or an appropriate equivalent, my change to cxacru 
causes the load to stay around 1.00 even when mostly idle since it now 
runs every second using round_jiffies:
> [  332.416288] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=5000 [start]
> [  332.417312] calc_load(1), count=-1, jiffies=5001 [start]
> [  332.417322] calc_load(1), count=4999, jiffies=5001 [finish]
> [  332.423382] cxacru_poll_status(..), jiffies=5007, next=993 [finish]
