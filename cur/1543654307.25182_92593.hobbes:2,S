Hi Andrew,

The testing status is: None, but it compiles.
The sg-driver maintainer has already said he does some testing
and the author of the previous code in st.c was positive about
using these features. That's why I've choosen these as my "victims".
I also found a locking bug in walk_user_pages() in case of OOM or
SIGBUS. Fixed by the attached patch.
The attached patch also exports some functions to enable modular
builds for testing.
And it also deletes the redundant check of the pfn_valid(), which
is done in follow_page() already.
Regards
Ingo Oeser
