That is not 100% true.... I don't know what apple had in mind. It also
depends in what slot you are.
Do you have ways to measure the difference ?
Try doing __ioremap(mgp->iomem_base, mgp->board_span, _PAGE_NO_CACHE);
instead of using the normal ioremap for #ifdef powerpc and tell us if it
makes a difference.
