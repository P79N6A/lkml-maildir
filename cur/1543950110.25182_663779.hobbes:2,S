I am not very clear about what you are asking for here, so let me try to
rephrase it, and if I have understood it correctly, we can move further
ahead from there.
So there are two different points, /mem and /cpu. /mem has A and C and
/cpu has A, B and C. A and B of /cpu correspond to A of /mem and the C's
are the same. With this is mind, if I say a task should move to B in
/cpu, it should also move to A in /mem?

Yes, that is a todo. We should get around to it as the functionality
gets implemented in kernel.

libcg is at a lower level than this. The dynamic migration of processes
can be based on top of libcg, and exploit it (and be more powerful than
the daemon I posted last year) It would be able to utilize the
configuration and other capabilities of libcg.
