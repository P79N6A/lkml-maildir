Neither 2.5.35 nor 2.5.36 has any critical bio fixes, so I would look
into this a bit more if I were you. Only if you were using
bio_kmap_irq() would there be something to look for, but DAC960 is not.
That was 2.5.35. 2.5.36 just starts sizing bio_vec pools based on free
memory, no bug fixes. Likewise in the block layer, I'm not seeing
anything.
