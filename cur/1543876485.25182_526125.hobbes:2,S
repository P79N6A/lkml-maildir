I think it would be much cleaner if you didn't implement your own sched_clock,
but you adjust ns_base/last_tsc to account for your lost cycles.
This could be done cleanly by adding a new function to sched-clock.c
Possibly such a function could be used by other parts of the kernel
in the future too.
