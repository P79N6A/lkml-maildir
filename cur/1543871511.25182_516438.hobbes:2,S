I'm not in Linus' head, but I think that he wanted the recurrent scheduler
problems to be addressed first for most users before going further. Too
much choice is often dangerous for quality. For instance, look at all the
netfilter modules. Many of them were completely bogus in their early stages,
and some of them even do mostly the same jobs, and many of them have never
left the "extra" stage. Choice is good to detect users' needs, it's good
for global evolution, but it's not as good when you want to have something
good enough for most people.

By "good", I mean a scheduler that is not trivially DoSable, and which
does not cause unexpected long pauses to some processes without any reason
(processes which cannot get any time slice for tens of seconds, or ssh
daemons which freeze under system load, to the point of totally preventing
remote administration past 50% CPU usage on some systems).

There's a difference between CPU and I/O scheduler though. With the CPU
scheduler, you've always had the choice to assign per-process priorities 
with "nice". Don't get me wrong, I'm all for pluggable schedulers, as I'm
an ever unsatisfied optimizer. It's just that I think it has been good to
encourage people to focus on real issues before dispersing efforts on
different needs. I hope that Con's work will eventually get merged and
that the door will be opened towards pluggable schedulers.
Best regards,
Willy
