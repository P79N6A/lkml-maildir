It would help if all the policy documents got grouped into a single 
Documentation/development directory so we could separate "policy documents in 
each language would be nice" from "that document about the amiga zorro bus 
really needs to be kept up-to-date in Navajo and that should be in the kernel 
tarball please".
Lemme see, which ones are we talking about?  The candidates are:
  applying-patches.txt
  BUG-HUNTING
  Changes
  CodingStyle
  debugging-modules.txt
  feature-removal-schedule.txt
  HOWTO
  kernel-docs.txt
  language-maintainers.txt
  ManagementStyle
  oops-tracing.txt
  SecurityBugs
  sparse.txt
  stable_api_nonsense.txt
  stable_kernel_rules.txt
  SubmitChecklist
  SubmittingDrivers
  SubmittingPatches
  volatile-considered-harmful.txt
That's everything I noticed in the top level directory that's a good candidate 
to be grouped into a "development" subdirectory.  Did I miss anything?
I note that Changes is a bit stale in places (16 bit assembly?), 
feature-removal-schedule.txt changes often but is good to know, 
kernel-docs.txt might be useless to translate considering it's mostly links 
to english documentation, language-maintainers.txt is assuming my patch from 
earlier today gets accepted...
I can submit a patch grouping all that stuff together into a subdirectory if 
it would help...

Does the above look like a good list?  There are more that need to be written, 
but that's what I saw in Documentation...

P.S.  Dear kmail/postfix developers: having a transient DNS lookup failure on 
one address in a long cc: list is _NOT_ a reason to have the message stay in 
the kmail outbox.  It should go into the postfix send queue and be retried 
from there.  Right now, if I tell it to resend, how do I know who it has and 
hasn't been successfully distributed to on the first attempt?  I've gotten 
dinged for trimming the cc: list before, but now I'm about to send out 
duplicates.  Wheee...
