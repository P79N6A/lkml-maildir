Hi,
With 2.6.16 x86_64 on a 4 core machine, I noticed
that the filp usage (according to /proc/slabinfo)
shoots up and keeps on increasing sharply when one
of the CPUs is (1) locked up, or (2) very busy
doing a lot of printk()'s with KERN_EMERG.
In the case of (1), it's permanent until it runs
out of memory eventually. For (2), it's temporary;
filp count comes back down when the printk()'s are
done.
I can't think of any relationship between a busy/
locked-up CPU and filp count. The system is still
functional. New short-lived processes kept being
created, but the overall number of processes is
stable.
Does anyone know why filp count would go up like
that?
Thanks,
bc
