Subject: Strange display artefacts on boot with modular IDE + VESA fb

Running with VESA fb (the only driver selected, vga=788) and modular IDE
loaded out of initrd (piix driver) after outputting message
"RAMDISK driver initialized: 16 RAM disks of 32000K size 1024 blocksize"
cursor jumps to the first screen line ans stays there; all other kernel
messages appear on the single first line. This continues until
/sbin/setsysfont is called out of rc.sysinit then display reverts to
normal.
booting with vga=normal does not show this problem; nor compiling kernel
with built in IDE. Observed on 2.6.2-rc2-mm2, 2.6.2-rc3-mm1, 2.6.2
kernel is SMP, preemption on single CPU system, GF2MX video, i815
shipset.
