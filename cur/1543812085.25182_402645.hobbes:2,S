This is because the BIOS has three "Processor" objects in the DSDT.
As I've mentioned before, /proc/acpi/*/* should not exist.
Internal ACPI BIOS names "CPU1, CPU1, CPU3" in this case
are actually arbitray 4-character strings, and should
never be exposed to the user in the file-system.
sysfs with cpu0, cpu1 -- predictable strings for objects --
gets it right, and is the direction we are going.
I'm afraid that even after we get this stuff out of /proc
and into sysfs where it belongs, we'll have to leave /proc/acpi around
for a while b/c unfortunately people are under the impression
that the path names there actually mean something and
they can actually count on them -- which they can't.
