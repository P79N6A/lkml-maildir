Having carefully reviewed your code I have come to the firm conclusion that
it is written in C.  The next step is to put it all in -mm and see if
anyone shouts at me.
I'll need help on the upstream-merge decision.
A convincing statement of interest (or, better, intent) from vendors (ie:
the people who will deliver and support this into the target users) would
help a lot.  Where do we stand with that?
Thanks.
