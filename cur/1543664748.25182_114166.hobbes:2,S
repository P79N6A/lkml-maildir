   DaveM, as the author of the original PCI DMA API, any comments on this
   (probably ill-thoughtout) idea?
Maybe a better idea is to kill map_single() altogether, and use
scatterlists everywhere.
Long term this is the kind of consolidation that ought to
happen anyways.
And then the implementation can stick whatever it wants in there.
