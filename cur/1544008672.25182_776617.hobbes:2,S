No they don't matter.
All arguments should be saved on ftrace_graph_caller to not loose them
on call entry hooking.
On return (return_to_handler), I thought that I only needed to save
%rax (return value), the other scratch registers shouldn't matter at
the return state and the others will be saved by the return hooker.
But when I only save %rax, my system crashes. I don't know why so I
kept saving all scratch registers.

Thanks. That and the generic move have actually been implemented by
Steven very recently:
