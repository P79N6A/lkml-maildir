If you source this file into your Bash shell, and maybe other post-Korn
shells, it should make a VGA font file named RAWBIT.VGAfont, using no
programs external to Bash. RAWBIT.VGAfont is a degenerate font that's 9
lines high and each glyph is vertical bitbars in the pattern of the ASCII
value being displayed, plus a couple 7's and a blank line for visual
indexing. It allows you to turn your unix workstation into a big UPC
scandcode. RAWBIT.VGAfont is particularly good for studying things like
Linus Torvalds' coding guidelines.
The data and routines used are from osimplay, my x86 assembler written in
Bash, with which one can produce other binary oddities like OS kernels and
VESA VBE 3.0 interfaces. Actually compembling a font line-by-line ala X
bitmaps takes several minutes on a Pentium 1 in osimplay, but this
degenerate little doohicky doesn't take long.
