Con, 
Thanks for the work, and nice web page!
To help with the testing, i have taken the liberty of adding your 2.4.19-ck3 
patch to the OSDL's Patch
LifeCycle Manager. It's patch # 768. I've queued up a couple of the basic 
tests against it, (dbench, dbt1 )
If you want to add future versions and get some testing run, see 
http://osdl.org/cgi-bin/plm
 - it's really easy,
and you can use OSDL to make up for your lack of hardware.  We do focus more 
on multi-cpu systems, but
we're always interested in scheduler tests.
