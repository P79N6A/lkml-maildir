I do not understand my problems either.  As far as I can tell I have
brought all of cipe up to 2.3.x (in the higher patch levels) standards
and APIs.  I still have it stall out... say early on in a telnet session
(as in I can't log in all the way).

Yes, I dug in deeper and found this.  It seems to be working
wonderfully.

becoming very frustrated with this.  I have spent a lot of my free time
the last few months working on this and can't seem to find where things
are wrong.

Thank you for your help, if you are interested in seeing the patch, just
let me know.  I think it is a tad long for this list (about 674 lines
via wc -l), hence the lack of it earlier.
