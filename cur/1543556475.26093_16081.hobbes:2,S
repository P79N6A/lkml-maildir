Second attempt, the first one failed due to stupid setup of ISP and the
usage of mail-abuse.org which blocks anything that has no reverse DNS
lookup. So some of my messages (about 20%) get lost and I have to resend
them when I feel it's been too quiet :)

Hi Christopher,
It is true that your patch fixes the problem as reported but let us look
one step deeper into the problem. Linux supports multiply mounted
instances of a filesystem and the check in sys_link() comparing the
mountpoints would refuse (with cross-device link error) linking between
them. This is correct. However, one level down, inside vfs_link() we also
check for ->i_dev match and that seems unnecessary, now that (with your
patch) link(2) would work correctly anyway.
Therefore, I propose a slightly modified (tested under
2.4.0-test12-pre4) version of the patch. What do you think? My philosophy
is -- since you made this feature work properly you should make it work
efficiently too and that means removing redundant code. 
Regards,
Tigran
