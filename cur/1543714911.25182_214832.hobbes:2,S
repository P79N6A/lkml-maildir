Can you be a little more verbose for me?  The ARM MMU doesn't keep
track of page references, AFAICT.  How does a context switch change
this?  
I have looked into the case where the TLB for an old page isn't being
flushed (by design), but I've been unable to fix the problem by
forcing a TLB flush whenever a PTE is zeroed.
