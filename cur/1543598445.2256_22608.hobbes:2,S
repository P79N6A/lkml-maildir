Hi Daniel,
I've been having some troubles which also seem to be use_once related.
(bonnie rewrite test induces large inactive shortage, and some nasty
IO seizures during write intelligently test. [grab window/wave it and
watch it not move for couple seconds])
I'll give your patch a shot.  In the meantime, below is what I did
to it here.  I might have busted use_once all to pieces ;-) but it
cured my problem, so I'll show it anyway.
