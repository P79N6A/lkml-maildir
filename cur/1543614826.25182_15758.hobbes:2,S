The point is to have N patches queued against rev x that apply cleanly by
themselves before even considering merging. The idea is to cut out as much
bogosity beforehand as possible. Turning them locally into 'changesets' or
whatever to perform the actual merge after deciding which ones you're
going to try applying is orthogonal.
