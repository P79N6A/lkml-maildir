Actually, wouldn't it be more of an IDE bug than a filesystem one
(considering that the problem doesn't happen in a SCSI-based system)??
Who should I contact in this case??

I don't think I use more than 7kB stack ... actually, I don't think I use
even 1kB ... :)

IRQ sharing is definitely _NOT_ the case (no boards / devices are sharing
IRQ's in the system). Timing is definitely an option (actually, it's my
best bet up to now).

There are no bottom half handlers in my driver, and the only bottom half
that is called from within it is NET_BH (which is called by a zillion
other drivers BTW ... ;). And NET_BH has to be running _after_ the
interrupt handler, because:
1. It's scheduled from within the interrupt handler;
2. The problem happens at an UP system;

Ok, I'll check that as well.
Thanks for all your help so far!!
