Not really my choice... and from what you say I'd better
not *touch* their stock kernel if I a project for which I 
specced that box happens.
Also, fresh feedback from the Consensys is that:
	"Just to be precise - As of today the kernel 
	 is 2.4.18-i59smp #1"
So that is a little better but still a little out
of date. I'm not terribly worried about the local
exploit because you don't tend to want to allow external
login accounts on things on your SAN's...
