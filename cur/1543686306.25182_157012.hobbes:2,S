Well, I was hoping to complete another low-level driver (Silicon Image) 
out there, but I would rather get bug fixes out first :)
libata driver architecture version 0.70 (helper library)
Intel ICH5 SATA driver version 0.93
Patch for 2.4.21:

.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.4/2.4.21-libata5.patch.bz2
Patch for 2.6.0-test3:
ftp://ftp
.??.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jgarzik/patchkits/2.6/2.6.0-test3-bk1-libata1.patch.bz2
Stressed on both 2.4 and 2.6, SMP and UP, lba2[48] and lba48.
Changes:
* lba48 fix
* SMP fixes
* locking sanitization
* locking documentation ("make pdfdocs")
* more infrastructure for command queueing and async taskfiles
Notes:
* Parallel ATA limited to UDMA/33 (SATA is full speed)
* ATAPI not ready for prime time
Still no data-corrupting bugs, knock on wood.
