But not initializing the fbdev will be much more effective at hiding the
bug than just displaying a warning, which could just be done inside
sysfs_create_file.
Besides, in most cases, there is no bug. That is, there is no bug that
will cause the file creation to fail and it will not fail.

Considering that in 99% of the case, the creation cannot fail unless
some cosmic ray hit your machine or you are running oom... that is,
plenty of cases where there is _no_ bug now gets a useless code bloat
for checking a result code where there is nothing sane you can do about
it anyway.
