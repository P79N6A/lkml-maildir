Thanks. Main problem with hardlinks is that unlink through NFS namespace
kills server (at least up to 5.0, I did not checked it during last few
months), and unlink through DOS (or OS2) namespace removes all instances 
of hardlinked file :-( A bit unfortunate behavior.

Not for now.

ncpfs 2.2.0.18 implements this (lib/ds/bindctx.c:NWDSGetBinderyContext),
but does not use it itself...

Novell documentation is a bit - hmm - unclear on this one...

Userspace ncpfs (specifically ncopy) uses 
(lib/filemgmt.c:ncp_ns_open_create_entry) NCP 87,30 or 87,33 for this
(and NW3.x is out of luck, AFAIK). Kernel code does not support MAC
forks (and ACL and extended attributes), as up to now there is no 
vfs API for this... You have to use ncopy,nwdir/nwrights,
nwtrustee,...,nwdir/eaops,nwdir for accessing MAC(&FTAM)/ACL/EAs for now.
(for EAs you must have post-August 27 ncpfs, betas are on
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/private/ncpfs
)
                                        Thanks,
