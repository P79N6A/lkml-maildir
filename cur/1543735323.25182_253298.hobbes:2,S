no - the inode lock is necessary.
don't let my second mail with the deadlock example confuse you : the 
original problem (i.e the problem my patch fixes) is a race between a 
cpuset mkdir() and another operation in the newly created directory, for 
instance just `ls'.
the race is:
mkdir a/b			|	ls a/b/cpus
 				|
cpuset_add_file(b, "cpus")	|	vfs_stat()
  cpuset_get_dentry(b, "cpus")	|	 user_path_walk()
   lookup_hash(b, "cpus")	|	  path_lookup()
    cached_lookup(b, "cpus")	|	   link_path_walk()
    d_alloc(b, "cpus")		|	    do_lookup()
 				|	     real_lookup()
 				|	      down(b->i_sem);
 				|	      d_lookup(b, "cpus");
 				|	      d_alloc(b, "cpus");
The result is that `ls' and `mkdir' both create a dentry for a/b/cpus, and 
the dentry created by `ls' is bogus since it does not point to the cpuset 
data.
The proper way to prevent this is to lock the i_sem of directory b.
This can be done in cpuset_populate_dir(), in cpuset_add_file(), or 
cpuset_get_dentry().
The similar piece of code in sysfs does it in add_file().
If your are not convinced try the following script.
Without my patch it triggers the bug in a few seconds.
 	Simon.
#! /bin/bash
a()
{
 	name=$1
 	echo dir is  /dev/cpuset/$name
 	while :; do
 		mkdir /dev/cpuset/$name
 		if ! test -r /dev/cpuset/$name/cpus; then
 			echo missing /dev/cpuset/$name/cpus
 			exit 1
 		fi
 		rmdir /dev/cpuset/$name
 	done
}
b()
{
 	name=$1
 	while :; do
 		test -r /dev/cpuset/$name/cpus
 	done
}
