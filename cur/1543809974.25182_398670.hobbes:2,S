There are 0, 1 or 2 tables associated with a device.  dm 
restricts which of them you can address through the ioctl
interface according to the state of the device.
Things are simpler if you can use this ioctl regardless of the state
of the tables, so a device-level one is more appropriate.

Much better: I'll do a complete review now, fix up remaining minor things 
and get it submitted.

*32 isn't but the other *32 ones are?
[In the userspace patch where you add the ioctl to the list you need to 
use the version number which first included it i.e. 4, 6, 0 and you also
have to add it to the libdm-compat file for v1.]
