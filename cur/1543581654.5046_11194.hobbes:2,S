Indeed. What a bad idea that would be.

On the other hand, that's also not a very good scheme. There *is* a good  
way to do this, and it would be really nice if vger could be taught to do  
it: add a List-Id: header (draft-chandhok-listid-04.txt RFC-to-be,  
implemented in lots of mailing list managers already).
Examples from that doc:
    List-Id: List Header Mailing List <list-header.nisto.com>
    List-Id: <commonspace-users.list-id.within.com>
    List-Id: "Lena's Personal Joke List"
             <lenas-jokes.da39efc25c530ad145d41b86f7420c3b.021999.localhost>
    List-Id: "An internal CMU List" <0Jks9449.list-id.cmu.edu>
    List-Id: <da39efc25c530ad145d41b86f7420c3b.052000.localhost>

Mailman, incidentally, _has_ List-Id: support.
