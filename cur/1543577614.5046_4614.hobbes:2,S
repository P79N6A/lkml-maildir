Duh. 
I figured out the problem. In 2.4.0-test13-pre3 is the introduction of
the shmall sysctl. I had installed a package called powertweak a while
back. It looks like powertweak sets any sysctl it doesn't know to 0. 
So, the problem was that there was no shared memory for X. ;( 
I set that up to a reasonable level and all is well. 
sorry for the wild goose chase. :(
