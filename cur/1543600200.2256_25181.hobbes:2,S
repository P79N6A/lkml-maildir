Solaris 8 update 7/01 documents a new system call, sendfilev,
which is like a cross between sendfile and writev.  A copy of
the man page is at 
http://www.kegel.com/sendfilev.txt
The question immediately comes up - is there an aio version?
I haven't seen one.
Come to think of it, has anyone thought what an aio version of 
plain old writev would look like?  lio_listio() is *unordered*,
but writev is ordered.  I wonder if something like
lio_ordered_listio() would be useful, or if that's just so complicated
it should be done in userland anyway.
