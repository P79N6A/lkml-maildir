As can turning tracing on at runtime.
And you can always define requirements in a way that your solution is 
the only one...
Let's go to a different point:
Your paper says "When not running, must have zero effective impact."
How big is the measured impact of your markers when not used without any 
immediate voodoo?
You have sent many numbers about micro-benchmarks and theoretical 
numbers, but if you have sent the interesting numbers comparing
1. MARKERS=n
2. MARKERS=y, IMMEDIATE=n
3. MARKERS=y, IMMEDIATE=y
in actual benchmark testing I must have missed it.
Does 3. have a measurable and effective advantage over 2. or are you 
optimizing for some 0.01% or 1% performance difference without any
effective impact and therefore not requred for the goals outlined in 
your paper?
