Hi all,
I'm trying to port some code from 2.4.x to 2.6.x.
I got a very strange error, that I would like to submit here (it might
help, we never know).
I am working with a clean 2.6.0-test7 (the test8 is scaring me a little
bit with all these reports I saw on the list :).
 irq.h
=======
/lib/modules/2.6.0-stable/build/include/asm/irq.h:16:25: irq_vectors.h:
No such file or directory
So basically, the "irq_vectors.h" file has disappeared...
But, we still can find it in:
./include/asm-um/irq_vectors.h
./include/asm-i386/mach-default/irq_vectors.h
./include/asm-i386/mach-visws/irq_vectors.h
./include/asm-i386/mach-pc9800/irq_vectors.h
./include/asm-i386/mach-voyager/irq_vectors.h
Any ideas ????
Regards

There are two major products that come out of Berkeley: LSD and UNIX.
We don't believe this to be a coincidence.
