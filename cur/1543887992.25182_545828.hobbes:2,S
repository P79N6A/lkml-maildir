No, writing trip-points is neither a fix, nor it is reasonable.
It is a workaround at best, and it is a dangerous and mis-leading hack.
The OS has no capability to actually change the ACPI trip points
that are used by the BIOS.  Changing the OS copy of them
to make the user think that trip events will actually
happen when the temperature crosses the OS copy is crazy.
If there are systems with broken thermals and the
ACPI thermal control needs and over-ride to turn
on the fan, then that is fine -- but using
fake trip-points and giving the user the impression
that they are real is not viable.
