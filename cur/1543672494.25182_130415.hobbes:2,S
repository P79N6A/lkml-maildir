Because the OP violated the lkml FAQ section 1.18:
All problems discovered whilst such a module is loaded must be reported
to the vendor of that module, /not/ the Linux kernel hackers and the
linux-kernel mailing list. [...] "oops" reports marked as tainted are of
no use to the kernel developers and will be ignored.
Davem just restated this fact with the same admittedly strong wording.
Felix von Leitner accused him of unprofessionalism and zealotry. That is
what I would call an offence.

It's even more shocking if a user insults a kernel developer and expects
this developer (or one of his peers) to actually take care of the
problem. wli chose to investigate the report anyway, something not to be
taken for granted.
Hey, if I insulted Al Viro I'd never expect him to help me (respond,
point out mistakes etc.) anymore. Besides that, Al saved me from diving
into floppy.c, for which I'm still thankful.
Chris: Just a heads up - you may get private hate mail from Peter
"Firefly" Lund like I did because you pointed out a mistake of the OP.
So be warned about it.
