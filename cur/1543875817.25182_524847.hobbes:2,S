Hi,
Why is arch/s390/crypto/Kconfig sourced when building for another arch ?
I'm trying to package a stripped down version of the kernelsource with 
only arch-specific code (/arch/$arch & /include/asm-$arch), the rest of 
/include, the whole KBuild setup & contents of /scripts to build 
3rdparty drivers against...
With the above files I can do a:
mv .config config.temp
make mrproper
mv config.temp .config
make oldconfig prepare scripts
and the tree stays intact ...
with 2.6.20.4 it works great, but when switching to 2.6.21-rcX it breaks 
with this:
drivers/crypto/Kconfig:55: can't open file "arch/s390/crypto/Kconfig"
I tried to fix drivers/crypto/Kconfig by changing the code to:
if S390
source "arch/s390/crypto/Kconfig"
endif
but it still gets sourced...
Now, since this is the only arch messing up (atleast on ix86 & x86_64),
shouldn't this be fixed somehow ?
