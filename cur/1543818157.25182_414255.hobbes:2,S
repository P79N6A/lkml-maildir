-ENOPARSE. CPU binding brings with itself obvious disadvantages that 
some applications are not ready to pay. CPU binding restricts the 
scheduler from achieving best resource utilization. That may be fine for 
some applications, but is not good enough for a good number of 
applications. So in no way can any 'CPU binding mechanism' (which 
already exists in multiple forms) replace the need and desire for a 
globally scheduled class of RT tasks.

-ENOPARSE. CPU binding is CPU binding. Could you outline an example of a 
"non-robust" CPU binding solution?
