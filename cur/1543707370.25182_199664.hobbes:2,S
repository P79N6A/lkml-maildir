That's what happens when the sender wraps the lines at column 80 and your 
client wraps at 72 (or similar situation), just another reason not to wrap 
when sending and let the users  client do whatever the user think is fine.
In order not to wrap and destroy information I have the autowrap feature off 
when composing mail, becase wrapped and cut stack traces, cuts from log files 
etc are a pain. 
BTW The 80 character rule is only mention wrt to signatures.
