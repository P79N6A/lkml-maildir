Oh dear, here's that misconception again.
static int a;
isn't a bug.  It is not "uninitialised data".  It is defined to be
zero.  Setting the BSS of any C program to contain non-zero data will
break it.  Fact.  The only bug you'll find is the fact that you're
breaking the C standard.
There is only two places where you come across uninitialised data:
1. memory obtained from outside text, data, bss limit of the program
   (ie, malloced memory)
2. if you use auto variables which may be allocated on the stack
All variables declared at top-level are initialised.  No questions
asked.  And its not a bug to rely on such a fact.
