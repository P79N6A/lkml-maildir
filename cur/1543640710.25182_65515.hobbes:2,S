It doesn't happen often, or under good circumstances.  In certain 
cases, the driver detects that something timed out and it assumes 
something on the card to be dead.  Instead of delaying the 
reinitialization of the dead card with a timer, they just do it during 
the interrupt where the problem was detected.
