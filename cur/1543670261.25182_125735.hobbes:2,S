Since we are on this subject...
I tried this kernel about 2 days ago, and had unexpected results at times.
1. the kernel would lock up, and so dead that not even the sysrq key did
anything (I usually turn that debugging stuff on)
2. it would work, but more than 1 application accessing the sound would cause
the kernel or give it up and once again, lock up.
3. it would just lock up the second app trying to gain access to the sound.
I do not have any output from the kernel, it crashed that hard (why..?)
first thing I did was apply the 2.4.21 pre patch, then the -ac patch to a
2.4.20 tree, this right?
anyone has any ideas on getting this to work right, and have at least more
than 1 application access the card, let me know.
im trying to get quake + teamspeak to co-exist.
