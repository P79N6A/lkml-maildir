I don't seem to have the original message, so by all means, send it along
and I'll give it a shot.  What does it apply against?  The current kernel
on the box in question is:
Linux rei 2.4.19-pre2-ac2 #2 Sun Mar 3 22:07:50 PST 2002 i686 unknown
although I can put anything else on it, if it's necessary.  I've built
2.4.19-pre3-ac6 but haven't gotten around to rebooting to it yet. :)
