I seem to remember Linus saying that "breaking things is  
unacceptable", not that the project was guaranteed to break things  
(we would just need to be much more careful about it than most kernel  
patches).  What that seems to indicate to me is that an in-kernel  
version would need to do the following for userspace-accessible  
header files for a large number of kernel releases:
#ifndef _LINUX_HEADER_H
#define _LINUX_HEADER_H
#include <kabi/header.h>
   /* Define or typedef a bunch of __kabi_ prefixes to the old  
prefixes they used to have in the kernel header */
#ifndef __KERNEL__
# warning "The header file <linux/header.h> is deprecated for"
# warning "userspace, please use <kabi/header.h> instead."
#else
   /* Kernel-only declarations/definitions */
#endif
If this were done carefully, all programs that compile against kernel  
headers could be _fixed_ in the short term (they'd go from throwing  
errors to giving a couple deprecation warnings).  In the long term,  
the extra ifdeffery could be removed and the <linux/*.h> headers for  
which a <kabi/*.h> replacement had existed for a couple versions  
could be removed.  New ABIs (including IOCTLs, new syscalls, etc)  
could be required to use <kabi/*.h> in the first place.

I think that requiring any kind of duplication of effort on that  
large a scale is virtually guaranteed not to work.  It will break  
down and be really painful for a long time.

1: Ewww, bad glibc!
2: The symbols in kabi/*.h should probably all start with __kabi_
The kernel _internally_ would "#include <kabi/foo.h>" and then  
promptly redefine or typedef all of those objects.  If the kernel or  
GLIBC want a struct renamed, they should #define  
__kabi_name_of_struct name_of_struct just before including the header  
file. We should also kind of frown upon non-libc userspace including  
many <kabi/*.h> files, since if they get included before libc can  
redefine the names to what it wants.

Perhaps we should use klibc as our test-case for functional headers,  
then, instead of glibc.

The solution to that is to make sure that the new exported kernel  
ABIs always have the __kabi_ prefix, so that we don't smash the  
namespace of various programs.
