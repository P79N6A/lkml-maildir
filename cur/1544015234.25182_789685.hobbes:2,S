We _definitely_ have too many inline functions in headers. They usually 
start out small, and then they grow. And even after they've grown big, 
it's usually not at all clear exactly where else they should go, so even 
when you realize that "that shouldn't be inlined", moving them and making 
them uninlined is not obvious.
And quite often, some of them go away - or at least shrink a lot - when 
some config option or other isn't set. So sometimes it's an inline because 
a certain class of people really want it inlined, simply because for 
_them_ it makes sense, but when you enable debugging or something, it 
absolutely explodes.
