Considering that several arch maintainers have vetoed my patch to revert 
the -ffreestanding removal Andi sneaked in with his usual trick to hide 
generic patches as "x86_64 patch", such a usage of a libc function name 
with a signature different from the one defined in ISO/IEC 9899:1999 is 
a namespace violation that mustn't happen.
