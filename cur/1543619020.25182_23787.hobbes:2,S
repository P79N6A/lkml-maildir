Subject: installing an APIC interrupt handler w/o patching the kernel?

Hi,
I'm developing tools to support the use of the Pentium 4 performance
counters and event-based sampling.  I currently have the tools working
for event-based sampling via the APIC performance counter interrupt.
To setup the handler for the APIC interrupt, I have patched the kernel
in a fashion similar to the approach Mikael Pettersson uses for his
perfctr driver.  However, I would like to avoid patching the kernel
in order to install the handler for the APIC interrupt.  I've attempted
to use request_irq(), free_irq(), prove_irq_on(), and probe_irq_off(),
but these just do not appear to be the appropriate interface for
installing APIC interrupt handlers (is this correct?).
Is there a recommended way to install an APIC interrupt handler without
patching the kernel?
Thanks,
Brink
