Yes, Good catch!

I thought about this approach, but did not implement the code this way
because a system could have thousands of containers and expecting a
statistics application to open a file descriptor each time for each
container will turn out to be an expensive operation
overhead =  2 syscalls (open + close) * number of containers * frequency
            of stats collections
I guess for now this is a good choice

The reason why I did not do so (augmenting container stats) is that
we send out an event on every exit and that might be heavy for the
container. The current implementation does not support the push
model (where data is pushed from the kernel), but that should be
easy to support for container events (as and when we find a useful
event to support).
