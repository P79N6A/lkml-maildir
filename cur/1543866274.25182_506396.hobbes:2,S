by this argument, why does mkuboot.sh exist at all then ?  let's
simply delete mkuboot.sh and change all arch Makefile's like so:
-    $(CONFIG_SHELL) $(MKIMAGE) ...
+    -mkimage ...
i of course prefer the existing solution: call the mkuboot.sh script
which checks for a few variations of the `mkimage` binary and if it
does not exist, output a friendly message
