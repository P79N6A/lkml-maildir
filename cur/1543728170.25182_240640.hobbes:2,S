If you have an early C3  (ie, pre Nehemiah model), then you will lack
the cmov instruction that gcc assumes is in 686's.  If the ALSA scripts
aren't aware of this, they will generate code which your CPU cannot run.

It's 686, just lacking various extensions. The current models have
all the same optional features you could find on a Pentium Pro,
plus a bunch of extra exclusive bits.
