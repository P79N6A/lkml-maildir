Hi,
I plan to build a variant of NFS on Linux. First, I made a client
by changing name symbols of NFS client and convert it as a loadable
module. Actually it is a NFS client with a different name, but I
could not mount it to a NFS server. It seems that the "mount" routine
could not tell it is a NFS like device and get the file handle from
the network, I read through the "strace" trace and drew the above
conclusion.
Can someone tell me how a "mount" for NFS works, how the system tell the
device is a network address and invoke RPC routine. What's the path of 
related source code? How it is done to convert a NFS client from a loadable
module to compiled in kernel? Besides convenience, is there any other 
consideration to move the NFS components inside kernel permanently?
regards,
Xiangping

Note the use of the word "interesting". I think it is quite doable. I don't
think it is at all trivial
