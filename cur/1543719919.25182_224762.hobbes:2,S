No.  The AT keyboard is still ONE device (cat /proc/bus/input/devices)
after loading 'evbug'.  It is  just connected to two handlers: kbd and
evbug.  No new  device is created just because  the AT keyboard device
is joined to the evbug handler.

Suppose there  are 2  "competing" drivers for  one device.  I  want to
switch the device to driver 2 at 23:00, and switch it back to driver 1
at 08:00.  How to do that?

Of course.  What can't be represented as bit-strings?

Then, go ahead an implement it.  I have no interest in sysfs.
