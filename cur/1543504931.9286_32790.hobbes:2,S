This is being cc'ed into the isdn developers mailing list, so they're
following this (I hope :-).  I've been able to convince them of a
couple of things in the past, so I think that acting as a two-way
gateway shouldn't be a problem. In cases anyone needs to contact any
or all of the developers for any reason, the
i4ldeveloper@listserv.isdn4linux.de list will work.

True. Point taken.
I'll wait until tomorrow or perhaps this weekend (Karsten Keil, the hisax
man, is on vacation and due back this weekend I understand, and I think
that as least he should be in on this).  At that point I'll contact you
offlist to work out details.
