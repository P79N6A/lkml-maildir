You're doing the wrong comparison. How many drivers are missing or
lacking in ability? And if you add to your handful of binary drivers
those thousands that exist for xp...
well, numbers do change. Also, most open source drivers aren't made by
the vendors themselves.
We're doing subjective math here. It doesn't change the fact that Linux
would be better off with improved hardware support, right?
