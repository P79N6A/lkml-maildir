I'm having probs with both of these..
incidentally, 2.2.1 works -beautifully- :)
Those wonderful PCI 56K modems that I don't know how to get setup.
They claim to be PNP which is prolly a bad sign..
Creative 56K and others.
They -don't- claim to be Winmodems...
Alright - any suggestions on a good brand/model?
On other notes I've got an AD-Chips soundcard here.  More or less standard
ISA pnp.  Almost compatible with Opl3sa2 driver... except it only uses 1
dma channel.  How do I set up a windows-sound-system compatible card like
this?  Only the opl3sa2 driver fails to init - it -does- successfully
detect the card though.  And no debug info *sigh*
G'day, eh? :)

PS: Sorry to bother you here but this seemed like the right place to ask
after I didn't find any answers by RTFS...
