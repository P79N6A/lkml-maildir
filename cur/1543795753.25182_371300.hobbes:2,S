Not quite. I spoke without looking at the code of the whole
notifier_call_chain() function.

Looking at the full code, it seems to me that we dereference
the first notifier block only inside the while(nb) loop.
That means the smp_read_barrier_depends() in the while(nb)
loop should be sufficient - IOW, the previous version of
the patch with one smp_read_barrier_depends() was good. 
Sorry about the confusion.
Thanks
