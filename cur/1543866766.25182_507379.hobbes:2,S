Doing as I am told, here we go:
This is 100% reproducible, ie: just doing a big rsync between 2 disks 
and burning a DVD at the same time. Note: the system isn't very 
responsive when this happens, most notably: audio seems to jump every 
~1second.
Hardware is an ASUS K8N-DL with a pair of Opteron 270s, 4GB PC3200, SATA 
  disks, software raid.

You can find a much longer version of the kernel output here:

http://194.145.196.85/ticks2
If you need anything else just let me know.
