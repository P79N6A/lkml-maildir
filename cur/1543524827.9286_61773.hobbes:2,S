I think part of the boobytrap patch is missing. I've been running
pre5+boobytrap2 without any warnings but the first time I tried a fetchmail
run I got all these.

Every address seems to be bogus, too. They're way out of range for the kernel.
Kernel symbols run from c0106000 to c01e964c and the modules start at
c3045000.
I built with gcc 2.7.2.3 so it's possible it has a problem with
__builtin_return_address but I doubt it.
