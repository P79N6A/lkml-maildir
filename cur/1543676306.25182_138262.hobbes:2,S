Subject: [PATCH] arch/alpha/kernel/time.c - override bogus clock freq gues ses
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2003/6/5/207

This is targeted at 2.4.20, but should apply cleanly to any of the 2.5
kernels too.
The clock frequency found in the Alpha HWRPB may be significantly off from
the actual frequency. The existing test is not stringent enough to weed out
errors that will swamp ntp; this patch reduces the allowable error from 1%
(10,000 PPM) to 250 PPM.
Kudos to Hal Murray <hmurray@suespammers.org> for insightful guidance;
tested on
my 3-way Alphaserver 4100 5/466 with very happy results. :-)
