Hi all,
Would it be feasable to modify the current keyboard
driver in such a way that it would log the last 1000
keystrokes pushed (possibly log it somewhere in /proc
or something)? When I say keystrokes, I mean
everything...even the ctrl and alt and shift bit keys
Something like this would greatly simplify the program
I am attempting to make.
Thanks
Alan
