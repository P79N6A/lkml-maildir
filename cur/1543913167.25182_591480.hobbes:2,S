Hi Jens,
Thank you for the comments.

It makes perfect sense but I have a reason I couldn't do it.
The goal of our patch set is to change the role of rq->end_io()
so that the request submitter can set its own procedure of
request completion (please see the patch 7/7).
So if the caller must hold the lock, we have to hold the lock
during the whole rq->end_io(), that includes end_that_request_first().
It would cause performance regression by making the lock held longer.
OTOH, the 'needlock' argument allows the completion handler to hold
the lock during the minimum piece of the code.
If you have any idea to fix the situation, I would appreciate it.
Below is the detailed explanation of the above.
I took your comment as below.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
static void __blk_end_request(rq, uptodate) {
	blk_queue_end_tag();
	blkdev_dequeue_request();
	end_that_request_last(rq, uptodate);
}
int blk_end_request_locked(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes) {
	if (end_that_request_first(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes))
		return 1;
	add_disk_randomness();
	__blk_end_request(rq, uptodate);
	return 0;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(blk_end_request_locked);
int blk_end_request(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes) {
	if (end_that_request_first(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes))
		return 1;
	add_disk_randomness();
	spin_lock_irqsave();
	__blk_end_request(rq, uptodate);
	spin_unlock_irqrestore();
	return 0;
}
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(blk_end_request);
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It's quite reasonable on the patch 1/7.
But the goal of this patch-set is to allow to hook the whole request
completion procedures by a single rq->end_io() hook.
(Please see the patch 7/7 for details)
So the callee (funciton_to_be_set_in_rq_end_io() below) needs to know
whether it has the lock or not.
To prepare for the change of the patch 7/7 and avoid code duplication,
I chose passing the lock information as an argument.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
static int function_to_be_set_in_rq_end_io(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes, needlock) {
	if (end_that_request_first(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes))
		return 1;
	add_disk_randomness();
	if (needlock)
		spin_lock_irqsave();
	__blk_end_request(rq, uptodate);
	if (needlock)
		spin_unlock_irqrestore();
	return 0;
}
int blk_end_request_locked(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes) {
	if (rq->end_io)
		return rq->end_io(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes, 0);
	if (end_that_request_first(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes))
	....
}
int blk_end_request(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes) {
	if (rq->end_io)
		return rq->end_io(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes, 1);
	if (end_that_request_first(rq, uptodate, nr_bytes))
	....
}
