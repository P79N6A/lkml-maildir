That's true, but irrelevent. Either the test can identify a problem that
applies generally, or it's doing nothing but measuring how good the system
is at doing the test. If the former, it should be possible to create a
simple test case once you know from the complex test where the problem is.
If the latter, who cares about a supposed regression?
It should be possible to identify exactly what portion of the test shows the
regression the most and exactly what the system is doing during that moment.
The test may be great at finding regressions, but once it finds them, they
should be forever *found*.
Did you follow the recent incident when iperf fout what seemed to be a
significnat CFS networking regression? The only way to identify that it was
a quirk in what iperf was doing was by looking at exactly what iperf was
doing. The only efficient way was to look at iperf's source and see that
iperf's weird yielding meant it didn't replicate typical use cases like it
was supposed to.
