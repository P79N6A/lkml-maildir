Keep in mind that Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie did not decide on a 
non-preemptive strategy for UNIX because they were unaware of such 
methods or because they were stupid. And when Rob Pike redesigned a new
"unix" Plan9  note there is no-preemptive kernel, and the core Linux
designers have rejected preemptive kernels too. Now it is certainly possible
that things have change and/or all these folks are just plain wrong. But
I wouldn't bet too much on it.
