You mean you just have to kill _all_ the children, and their
children _in order_.  This seems like a big security hazard to
me.... Vfork bombs could become quite difficult to stop.... e.g.
while(vfork());
you'd have to start killing at the high end (pid-wise), but the
processes are _created_ at the high end, so you would fail.
