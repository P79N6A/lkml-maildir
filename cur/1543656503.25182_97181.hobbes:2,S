Who from 3ware told you it isn't compatible?  That's totally bogus.  
It's completely compatible.
3ware supports 6, 7, and 8000 series cards with a single driver in 
2.2, 2.4, and 2.5 trees.
If it isn't working for you, let me know.

Any idea at which point the 2.5 driver stopped working ?
It may not be that much work to bring that version up to date as
a 3ware-old.c driver in a worse-case scenario.
This would be huge code duplication however, and would be much
better fixed by having the driver detect which card its running
on, and 'do the right thing' wrt which firmware it needs.
