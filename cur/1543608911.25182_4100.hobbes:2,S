I'm sorry, but this is the Compaq Armada notebook and in its BIOS
I can't disable even ACPI or this device :-((( Maybe it is
possible in special "BIOS setup program" which can be load from
Compaq rescue partition: however I remove this partition :-(
I can only remove this device physically from notebook...
But I have good news (maybe): when I switch off ACPI in the
kernel config, I can work with PCMCIA w/o David's patch...
(New kernel fetched from sgi CVS, because I have xfs on the root
filesystem, version is 2.4.14-xfs) ;-))))
Thank you for advice...
Sincerely
Jan Marek
