I finally get the SX6000 working but I'm not using the I2O. The promise 
driver
seem to work better. But I do get I2O to mount the driver only the fact 
that it
keep giving me
i2o/iop0: No handler for event (0x00000020)
i2o/iop0: Hardware Failure: Unknown Error
 From here Alan talk about some solution that may make it work... But I 
don't
really understand it.

Anyway, I try 2.4.18 ( it hang on boot ), 2.4.19 ( it hang on boot),
2.4.20 ( it work with lot of message ) i2o and still not working. So I 
use the
promise driver right now. If anyone know what should I do to get I2O work
with SX6000, please let me know. I would like to compare the drivers.
Thanks
Alex
