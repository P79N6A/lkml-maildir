The patch did great. It fixed the CurCHS value to the correct BIOS setting.
Thanks for the time to look into it. 
I also tried adding a
append = "hda=847,128,63"
to lilo.conf (without applying the patch) - and that did the job as well. 
I really don't know why the DISK is reporting wrong track # values.
It coould be that the  BIOS is messing things up - but I'm really not an
expert here - and I didn't have much time to find out all the info.
The motherboard is a Tyan Tomcat IV 1.01 with 2 Pentiums (166MMX), 
with Award Modular BIOS 4.51PG  (or P6 - I can't read my own handwriting :))
[ROM PCI/ISA BIOS (2A59FT59)]
I know it supports LBA - as you can see from the hdparm, but I can't find
the manual right now to read up on the details.
