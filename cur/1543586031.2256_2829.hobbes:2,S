So you recommend to connect the mouse to USB (instead of psaux) because
psaux+Xfree86 are losing bytes under circumstances (e.g. some load pattern).
This is a fine solution for users with dual protocol mice, but doesn't
resolve the problem for other poor ps/2 mouse owners !

Even with PS/2 mouse support in the "new input" driver I wouldn't expect the 
psaux-byte-lost bug to disappear magically.
