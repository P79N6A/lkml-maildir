Serial ATA merely changes the bus, a.k.a. the interface between drive 
and system.
This doesn't mean that the drive itself will be any faster...  most 
first-gen SATA drives are just PATA drives with a new circuit board and 
new firmware.  Just like some SCSI and IDE drives are exactly the same 
platters, but have differing circuit boards and connectors...
