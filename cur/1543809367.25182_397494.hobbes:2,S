If you believe this patch is the root cause of the regression you have
been seeing. Then, I would say the thing is a little bit different with
ec_intr=0 and ec_intr=1. Basically, ec_intr=0 will disable EC related
ACPI interrupt before finishing _Qxx method execution , but ec_intr=1
always enable EC interrupt.  This could cause some hardware/BIOS
events get lost under ec_intr=0, which shouldn't lost.
We need to figure out what's going on here rather than falling back to
ec_intr=0 behavior.
