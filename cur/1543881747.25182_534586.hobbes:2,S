Shared IRQ is okay because ahci has pending IRQ register which is masked
by ->freeze().  Controllers which don't have such feature check qc
status to determine whether it's expecting IRQ, so it's okay for them
too.  So, AFAIK, libata is okay with shared IRQs.

Yes, we are.  :-)

I'm pretty sure Berck's problem is caused by ->freeze() not clearing
pending IRQ bit.  We haven't been too strict about ->freeze().
Considering the above 0xffffffff case, I agree it's better to fix it in
the core instead of fixing each LLD.  Will brew up another patch.
Thanks.
