Dunno here, seems that having one tool that gave the kernel a key named
"foo" and then telling dm-crypt to use key "foo" is probably not a bad
way to go. Then we don't have stuff like "echo <key> | dmsetup create"
and the like and the key-handling smarts can all be put in one
separate place.
Getting from here to there might be interesting though. Perhaps we can
teach dm-crypt to understand keys of the form "keyname:<foo>"? in
addition to raw keys to keep compatibility. Might even be possible to
push this down into crypt_decode_key() (or a smarter variant of same).
Meanwhile, I'd still like to hide the raw key in crypt_status().
