Some followup -- it was setting/testing 1 integer.  So it
seems it can safely be done w/o lock.
Talking with an internal engineer here -- NUMA uses MESI
cache control similarly to the i386 cache coherency model,
so a write of one CPU to a an area of memory will be seen
on other processors as soon as they ask for that memory.
Cache lines on the MIPS-NUMA use a 128-byte (not bit) cache line,
so for optimal performance, you'd want you weren't sharing
that cache line w/any other frequently used/modified data.
Now how to guarantee proper cache alignment on a given
platform....hmmm
