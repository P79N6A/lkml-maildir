Yes, good point.

I don't know your code and I don't really have the time to look at it
in depth, but I'm a bit surprised. Presumably your driver is
implementing a number of interfaces (e.g. hwmon) and you create a class
device for each one. You can have as many class devices hanging of a
(physical) device, so I fail to see why you would need to register
several (physical) devices.
