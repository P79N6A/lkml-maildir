Subject: [PATCH 0/6] VMI paravirt-ops patches
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These are the patches for the VMI backend to paravirt-ops.  Base
kernel where I tested them was 2.6.19-git20.
Basically, there are only a couple of hooks needed that were left
out of the initial paravirt-ops merge, and then the backend code
is a very straightforward implementation of the paravirt-ops
functions.
Andrew or Linus, please apply or shoot me nasty feedback that I
will promptly turn into marvelous looking code.  I've Cc'd Andi,
who originally was going to take up the patches, but seems to
have been snowed in.
