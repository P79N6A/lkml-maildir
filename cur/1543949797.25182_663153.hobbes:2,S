Subject: [PATCH] Fix DMA access of block device in 64-bit kernel on some non-x86 systems with 4GB or upper 4GB memory
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/3/4/111

For some non-x86 systems with 4GB or upper 4GB memory,
we need increase the range of addresses that can be
used for direct DMA in 64-bit kernel.
