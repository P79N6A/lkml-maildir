I just realised that such a name would contain '/' and I'm quite sure
that makes filesystems unhappy.
Neil suggested using device numbers which would work, however I think
those might not be human friendly. While its easy to find the device
number of a given path (eg.: stat -c %d /), its rather hard to find the
path belonging to a given device number.
