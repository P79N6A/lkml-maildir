*sigh*  I don't think I will go over this again since you don't
seem to read your email anyway...

"You're not using your soundcard right now. No reason to keep
ISA DMA memory free now."
Now imagine what happens when Juan wants to play some music
and the sound driver wants to allocate a DMA buffer...
(also, the "classzone doesn't try to free DMA memory" contradicts
an earlier email by you)

That _you_ can't see any other way doesn't mean there is
no better way to do these things. The solution is to have
a scavenge and inactive list.
Basically this means that:
1) we don't throw away the data of pages we want to free,
   meaning that we can "free" any page we want ... because
   the data is remembered there's no harm in doing that
2) we can see which zone has the biggest percentage of old
   pages, so we can do allocations from that zone
3) we don't mess up page aging because we skip writing out
   dirty pages, etc...

Don't think so. Stephen Tweedie, Juan Quintela, Alan Cox and
me have been thinking long and hard about a new VM design that
will work better than any modification to the current system.
We'll talk about it next week at OLS.
(the basic ideas are like the VM design I posted to linux-mm
about 5 weeks ago, we have just changed some of the details)
regards,
Rik
