Did you measure the cost of that amortizing too?
My guess is that especially with TLBs getting larger and larger the
cost of full CR3 flushes are rising.

I think it would be an interesting experiment to switch flush_tlb_range()
over to INVLPG if the length is below some threshold and see if there 
are visible effects in macro benchmarks. The main problem
would be to determine the right threshold -- would likely be CPU dependent.
