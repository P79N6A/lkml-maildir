Subject: xawtv segfaults with 2.2.3-ac1 (not 2.2.3)

and since fbtv works as a charme i guess it's not a kernel-issue.
Mar 11 02:33:40 lisse wmaker[23293]: This is xawtv-2.37, running on Linux/i686 (2.2.3-ac1)
Mar 11 02:33:40 lisse wmaker[23293]: x11: 1280x1024, 16 bit/pixel, 0 byte/scanline
Mar 11 02:33:41 lisse wmaker[23293]: v4l: device is BT878(Hauppauge new)
Mar 11 02:33:41 lisse wmaker[23293]: mmap: Invalid argument
Mar 11 02:33:41 lisse wmaker[23293]: v4l: 1280x1024, 16 bit/pixel, 2560 byte/scanline
i never got the mmap: invalid argument part before either.
(and since the 2.2.3-ac1 patch doesn't touch any bttv-code, it must be the
framebuffers ?)
