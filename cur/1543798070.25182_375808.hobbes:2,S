Sounds like I am not the only one that it is new to...
There are over four hundred instances of wmb() still in the drivers tree
in 2.6.14.  I suspect that most of them are for MMIO fencing -- the ones
I looked at quickly certainly seem to be.
But, given mmiowb(), what is the point of having wmb()?  Why are
write memory barriers needed in UP kernels if not for MMIO and other
hardware-specific accesses?  Is your thought that use of wmb() should
be phased out in favor of mmiowb()?  (Might be a good idea, but doesn't
look like we are there yet.)
							Thanx, Paul
