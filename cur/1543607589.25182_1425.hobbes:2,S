I went over your original patch good; I am surprised I missed this. :/
Nonetheless, only with the new cleanups could anyone spot this.

I think I prefer your sizeof() method, if for nothing else but that we
can keep it consistent -- we can always take the sizeof a variable and
not everything has its size in a define.
Furthermore, sizeof(tmp) certainly means "size of the variable temp"
while TMP_BUF_SIZE could be the size of anything related to tmp -- the
buffer it points to (if it were a pointer), a buffer in it (if it were a
struct), etc.  Since it all compiles to the same, it is not a huge
issue.  Just my two bits...
