I happened to do some sums about a week ago.
My first drive was ST225R, which was 60M,3600RPM and the whole drive could be
read in 2 or 3 mins.
My new 160G drive is 7200RPM, and reads in around 50 mins.
It's not a complete coincidence that sqrt(160/.06) is about 50, and the number
of revs to read the drive is pretty much dead on 50 times.
The areal density of disk drives tends to go up both by adding more tracks, and
by squeezing the data into each track more densely.
While you can speed up the disk maybe 5 times if you are willing to pay the price,
the increasing number of tracks means that you'r still going to need lots more
revs to read the drive.
