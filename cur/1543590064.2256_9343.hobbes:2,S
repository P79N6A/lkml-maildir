Quick note.  I *AM* seeing this problem on a Tyan S2390B which has the
Via KT133A chipset on it.
AMD Athlon 1.33ghz
2x256m DIMMs
Linux 2.4.4-ac5
I haven't done the ksymoops conversions yet, but please let me know if you'd
like anything else.  But basically, it looks exactly like what all the IWILL
owners are seeing.
Any other tyan S2390B users?
thx, -j
