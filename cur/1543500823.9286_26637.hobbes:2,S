IMHO Linux simply don't not need this
kind of utility, because:
1) The system simply works as is. I.e, do
you need a defrag for ext2?
2) A Unix-like system is highly configurable
and programmable per-se. Do you need
a special tool to schedule an operation at
a certain time?
Of course, if you intend that Linux could
profit from a nice graphical tool which
launches a disk check or a cron
configuration utility with a picture of
doctor with a stethoscope, you could
do it with Gnome and/or KDE libs.
