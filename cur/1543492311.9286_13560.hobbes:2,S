Hi everybody,
  The first NFSv3 client patches against linux-2.2.5 are now available
for testing on my WWW-site. Please check out
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/linux-2.2.5-nfsv3-0.3.1.dif.bz2
(against stock linux-2.2.5)
or
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/linux-2.2.5-ac4-nfsv3-0.3.1.dif.bz2
You will need to get a special patched version of the 'mount' utility
in order to use the NFSv3: I've made it available as a patch against
stock mount-2.8a, or you can pick up the RPMs from the directory
  
http://www.fys.uio.no/~trondmy/src/nfsv3-mount/
Please be aware that you need to use the 'nfsvers=3' option when
mounting an NFSv3 partition, as default behaviour of this mount is
still to use NFSv2. At some point, when this project gets more
serious, I'll probably add in support for automatic selection of
NFSv2/v3.
Note
----
   -   This version of NFS will not give you access to files > 2GB
       unless you are running on a 64-bit Linux system. Its main
       interest for ix86-based systems, in my opinion, will be against
       servers with slow disks...
   -   I haven't touched the nfsroot code. It may, or may not compile, but
       it certainly won't allow mounting of NFSv3 partitions.
   -   Most of the credit for the work in these patches should go to
       Olaf Kirch. I've just been doing some cleaning up and finishing
       off his excellent work.
Cheers,
  Trond
