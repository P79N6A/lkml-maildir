Trailing commas in enums were NOT allowed before C99. C99 allows them,
and gcc and some other compilers allowed this syntax before C99. 
Since the kernel is going to use the .field= (C99) syntax for structure
initialisers anyway, I don't see any point in removing trailing commas.
(Especially not in code I once wrote :-))
As an aside, the fact that gcc warns about them is probably a compiler
bug: (
http://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html
)
'In some places, -pedantic warnings don't take proper account of the
standard version selected.'
