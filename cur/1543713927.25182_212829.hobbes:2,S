No routing cache? Doesn't sound like a good idea.

And even more vast overkill for most linux users than the existing
routing code already is.  Linux has at least the beginnings of a pluggable
FIB interface (fib_table), which has slightly bit rotted, but probably
not too bad. I would suggest you clean that up, make the existing
hash table really optional and then you can just plug in anything you want.

What do you consider dirty in the current stack?
