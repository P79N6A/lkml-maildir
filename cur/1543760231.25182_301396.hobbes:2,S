Tony,
Can you try the patch below? (inspired by a patch from Tom Zanussi -
gotta give credit where credit is due... :-)
This solves the problem for me but I'd like independent confirmation.
BTW, this also fixes a problem with the return value for printk,
which is supposed to be the actual amount printed.  This was incorrect
in the printk-times=y case, but also in the '=n' case where a log-level
tag is inserted by printk automatically.  This looks like a longstanding
bug.  (Although I doubt a very important one, since no one appears
to ever look at the printk return value.)
Thanks,
 -- Tim
