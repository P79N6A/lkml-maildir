I am just of the opposite opinion. It is a project maintainers' job to fix
bugs. A distributions' job is to _distribute_ packages in its pure sense.
Obviously people creating a distribution run across bugs while checking out the
projects to pack into their distro. So I very well agree they should do
_something_ about it, BUT this "something" is _not_ creating more or less
useful patches for their (and their customers) use, but get in contact with the
project maintainer and hand them the patches, look for their approval and
_then_ move the project into their distro. There is no sense in creating a
debian patched pppd, a SuSE patched pppd and a RH-patched pppd, altogether
different from the projects basic pppd. (This is not a real example, but only a
clarification of what I'd say is _the wrong way_ (tm))

Just contrary I'd state that this would be the "perfect world", because this
would mean all projects are in perfect shape and all patches have gone to the
respective maintainers.

So you say midnight commanders' maintainer is an a**hole, or what?
If you think some project needs patches, then please talk to its maintainer (if
any), or get involved and become its maintainer...
I do think though, that there should be something in between, namely a place
where projects are hosted that (currently) have no maintainer, but where one
can send patches that are needed for some reason. This is a bit of a political
question, maybe OSDL can be such a place. Whatever the place is, it should be
independent to a degree.

diffsize small is wanted.
diffsize zero is unwanted.
What kind of a logic is that?
Forgive me Pavel, that does not sound thoughtful to me.
