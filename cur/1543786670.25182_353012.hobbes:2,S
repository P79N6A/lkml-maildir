The slowdown is HZ dependent:
* HZ=1000 - game is playable. If I would not know slowdown is there I
  wouldn't notice it.
* HZ=100 - messages at the top are printed r e a l l y  s l o w.
* HZ=250 - somewhere in the middle.

Typical pattern is:
rt_sigaction(SIGTSTP, {SIG_IGN}, {0xb7f1e578, [], SA_RESTART}, 8) = 0
poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0) = 0
poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0) = 0
write(1, "\33[11;18H\33[37m\33[40m[g] Gnome\r\33[12"..., 58) = 58
rt_sigaction(SIGTSTP, {0xb7f1e578, [], SA_RESTART}, NULL, 8) = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGTSTP, {SIG_IGN}, {0xb7f1e578, [], SA_RESTART}, 8) = 0
poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0) = 0
poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0) = 0
write(1, "\33[12;18H\33[37m\33[40m[h] Hurthling\r"..., 62) = 62
rt_sigaction(SIGTSTP, {0xb7f1e578, [], SA_RESTART}, NULL, 8) = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGTSTP, {SIG_IGN}, {0xb7f1e578, [], SA_RESTART}, 8) = 0
poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0) = 0
poll([{fd=0, events=POLLIN}], 1, 0) = 0
write(1, "\33[13;18H\33[37m\33[40m[i] Orc\r\33[14d\33"..., 56) = 56
rt_sigaction(SIGTSTP, {0xb7f1e578, [], SA_RESTART}, NULL, 8) = 0
rt_sigaction(SIGTSTP, {SIG_IGN}, {0xb7f1e578, [], SA_RESTART}, 8) = 0
I can send full strace log if needed.
