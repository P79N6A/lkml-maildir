If you look at include/linux/compiler-gcc3.h, you see that in the 
kernel, we #define "inline" to "inline __attribute__((always_inline))"
for gcc >= 3.1 .
In November 2002, we didn't do this in 2.4 kernels.
Can you test whether my patch makes any difference in the size of a 2.6 
kernel with gcc 3.2?
