Subject: [PATCH] bonding: Fix use after free in unregister path
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/6/19/279

	The following patch (based on a patch from Stephen Hemminger
<shemminger@linux-foundation.org>) removes use after free conditions in
the unregister path for the bonding master.  Without this patch, an
operation of the form "echo -bond0 > /sys/class/net/bonding_masters"
would trigger a NULL pointer dereference in sysfs.  I was not able to
induce the failure with the non-sysfs code path, but for consistency I
updated that code as well.
	I also did some testing of the bonding /proc file being open
while the bond is being deleted, and didn't see any problems there.
