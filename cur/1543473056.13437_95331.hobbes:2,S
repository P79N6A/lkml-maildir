Not really my point.  I just wondered if anyone has ever tried to
secure permission or get them to free up that patent so that mods
to gcc can be made without worrying about the patent being used to
stop development.
Is this the only register related patent?

OK... so again, has anyone asked ever asked the patent owners about
this?  Just curious.  I mean, if I knew how to make the changes to
gcc, I'd just ask them to release the patent or grant an exemption
for all GPL software, or whatever would be the best way to handle it.
I am still confused about section 7 of the GPL which doesn't
explicitely say you can't use patented code and seems to say it's
OK if the patent owner agrees to free distribution.
I know there is an earlier section of the GPL saying patents should
be freed but that seems more like discussion while the numbered
sections are the guts.

Yeah, well now it's 20 years, and the patent grants don't seem
to be slowing down.
