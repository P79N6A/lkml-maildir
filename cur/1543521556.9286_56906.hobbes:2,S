Hi Brendan,
It's possible that your socket is a bit unsoldered
from
your motherboard. To test this, you should try to
tickle your keyboard plug while using it.
It's also possible that your keyboard controller is a
bit broken. For example, most 486 motherboards equiped
with an UMC8498 chipset have a poor I/O controller
which also replaces the 8042 and which behaves badly
with many standard keyboards. There are a few
keyboards
which work correctly with it.
I don't know if all the keyboards you tried were the
sames or of different makes, but if there are the
sames
this could definetely be a keyboard <-> controller
incompatibility.
Willy
