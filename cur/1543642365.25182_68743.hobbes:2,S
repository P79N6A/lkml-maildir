Hmm, I like that idea.  But I was talking about current implementation. 
If we want to do this then we'd need to fix up every ptrace
implementation in every architecture to call the appropriate function;
it's a separate problem.

Well, it seems to me that when a traced task has an event, it should be
reported first to the debugger - for signals this happens in do_signal
- and then possibly to the normal parent.  But I'm not sure if this
actually happens right now or not.  Worth investigating some more.
