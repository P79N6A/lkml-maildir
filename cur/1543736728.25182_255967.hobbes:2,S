Well i meant can't you define them in a header file as follows;
static void inline acpi_unregister_gsi (unsigned int irq)
{
}
An advantage is that it saves memory since you don't also have to create 
the extra data objects for the exported symbol. But really you don't have 
to export something which does nothing.
