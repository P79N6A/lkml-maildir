Oops. I only understand "trainstation". I guess you will put the fixed 
patch on the list. Do you? :-)
In drivers/ide/pci/ some other drivers have a *.h file. Maybe you mean that?
Then I discover on 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2004/8/1/121
 a double linebreak, 
wich causes an error. It is not there in the newsgroup. Strange.
#define DECLARE_ITE_DEV(name_str)			\
	{						\
		.name		= name_str,		\
		.init_chipset	= init_chipset_it8212,	\
		.init_hwif	= init_hwif_it8212,	\
		.channels	= 2,			\
		.autodma	= AUTODMA,		\
		.bootable	= ON_BOARD,		\
	}
