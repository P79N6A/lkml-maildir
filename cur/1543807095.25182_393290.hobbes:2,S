I have had no problem with a USR2210 PC Card for my Dell laptop,
 running the soon-to-be-in-mainline ACX drivers by Andi Mohr and
 more recently Denis Vlasenko. This driver is at the moment in -mm.
The newer laptop runs an Intel 2200BG with in-kernel drivers fine, apart
 from not dealing well with being put in monitor mode (firmware restarts
 every few seconds gobbling 70% CPU even with very low traffic). As a
 matter of fact, current drivers won't even allow you to put the card in
 monitor mode - you have to explicitly enable the code by editing the
 source files; that's intentional as the developers know about the issue.
