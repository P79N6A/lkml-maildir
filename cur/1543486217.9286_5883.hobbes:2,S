I.e. "post-install aha152x /sbin/insmod sym53c416"
and  "post-remove aha152x /sbin/rmmod sym53c416"
I agree that this is not the most beautiful solution, but unfortunately it
is the only one available at the moment. Something better has to be invented.
I'll take a look at modutils, but I guess that the _real_ solution will be
not be around until it is time for 2.3...
