You go back to the old behaviour by commenting out the
invalidate_buffers call in
	if (atomic_dec_and_test(&bdev->bd_openers))
		invalidate_buffers(rdev);
in blkdev_put().
A rather silly but effective measure is to start
the command openflop:
	#include <fcntl.h>
	main(){
	        int fd = open("/dev/fd0", O_RDONLY);
	        pause();
	}
each time after inserting a floppy, and to kill it
before taking the floppy out again.
(For me reading a floppy takes 72.5 seconds each time
without this command, and 0.1 sec the second time
with this command.)
Why was it changed? I think it was a very bad move.
The main reason was that Alexander Viro didnt see
how to retain guaranteed correctness without it.
Alan pseudo-defended it by saying that some devices
have a broken detection of media change.
So, presently we leave detection of media change
to the user who has to run openflop.
You may find the discussion in the archives.
