Look at linux/net/ipv4/tcp_timer.c in the kernel source, the function
tcp_delack_timer should read exactly as:
void tcp_delack_timer(unsigned long data)
{
	struct sock *sk = (struct sock*)data;
	if(!sk->zapped &&
	   sk->tp_pinfo.af_tcp.delayed_acks &&
	   sk->state != TCP_CLOSE) {
		/* If socket is currently locked, defer the ACK. */
		if (!atomic_read(&sk->sock_readers))
			tcp_send_ack(sk);
		else
			tcp_send_delayed_ack(&(sk->tp_pinfo.af_tcp), HZ/10);
	}
}
The important part is the check of sk->sock_readers, if you do not
have this check, upgrade.  pre7 has several tcp bugs, you might as
well squash them all at once by using 2.2.1 if you can.
