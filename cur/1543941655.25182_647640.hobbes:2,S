I know this, because I've never needed to even read the document to understand 
why the API may have to change. But there are people that are very brain 
dead - I mean *EXTREMELY* brain dead who will start drooling and not 
understand the whole point of the document without a simple statement like 
the above.
It is those people - and I've had a hell of a lot of contact with them 
(including people manning the phones in tech support departments!) - that 
wouldn't understand that the reason for the lack of a "fixed, stable API" is 
because of the various API changes that add capacity.
(Instead they'd say "But MS does it with Windows" - ignoring the fact that the 
Windows API changed when NT3.51 was released, changed again when Win95 was 
released and has changed with *EVERY* release of Windows since - to the point 
that there are programs written for Win95 that can't/won't run on an XP 
machine.)

No, I don't. Never have. But the fact is that there *ARE* people who do think 
that way. I've had a hell of a lot of contact with them. When I talk to 
people about using Linux (locally - I get "pinged" by someone every time I 
walk into a store to buy something, anymore) there is at least one person who 
complains that they can't run Linux because required hardware X isn't 
supported, and the manufacturer says its because there isn't a stable API to 
write the driver against. (though it's usually a lot coarser and less 
technical - I'm sure you understand)

Yes, it does, but you are making the mistake I used to make all the time and 
assuming that most people are going to actually have the ability to take the 
information in the document and comprehend that any *ONE* of the reasons that 
a stable API is bad is enough to not have one.
Having such a paragraph to point to - or just having it there when those 
dead-brained people actually find and read the document - will definitely be 
a good thing.
...
And now that I've re-iterated and explained the rather poor opinion I have of 
most people in the world and how it applies to this situation, I'm going to 
shut up and not say another word about this.
