Ok, I'm not finding any documented quirks that would be memory regions, 
and in fact it doesn't look like there is even any remotely likely 32-bit 
valies that might be pointers in your PCI config space that look remotely 
like they might be conflicting in the area of MMIO space that we allocate 
PCI resources from (ie 0x88000000-0x92000000).
Of course, any odd MMIO regions might be descibed by some insane model 
that doesn't look like an aligned 32-bit value, but that's unlikely.
So I'm still not seeing anything wrong in there.

Sure. It will be interesting to see if it makes any difference.
