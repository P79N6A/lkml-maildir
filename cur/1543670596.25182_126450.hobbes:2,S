Well the definition of EXTABLE is wrong on the v850, for the same reason
the definition of RODATA is wrong; see the previous discusion on lkml
for details.
[The v850 has hairier linker script(s) than most args, and making it
conform to the model you've chosen will probably require all its linker
scripting to be rewritten.  I haven't gotten around to figuring out how
that can be done yet.]
