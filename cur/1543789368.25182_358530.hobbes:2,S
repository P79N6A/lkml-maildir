I'm sorry to hear that, but it's not a kernel development priority.
And since I'm nearing completion of a task which we expect to satisfy
what SGI's been asking for almost a year, which I had been obstructing,
I'm disinclined to drop it now in order to help meet their latest fancy.

I'm definitely not in charge here, and cannot answer that.  But I
think it's unlikely, unless Linus and Andrew are pretty sure that
what you have now is really the way they want to go in the long term.
You will, as ever, be entitled to apply your patch on top of 2.6.15
(but it may not apply without some changes).
Repeating a technical question (sorry, that now seems off-topic!):
what do you expect to happen with PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE?
