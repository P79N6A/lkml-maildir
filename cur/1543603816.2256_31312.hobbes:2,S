 And from our discussion about packet-reordering we get even more motivation
 for the "extra-polls" not only to save IRQ's 
 We may expand this to others too...
 As polling-lists are per CPU and consecutive polls stays within the same
 CPU the device becomes bound to one CPU. We are protected against packet 
 reordering as long there are consecutive polls.
 I've consulted some CS people who has worked with this issues and I have
 understood packet reordering is non-trivial problem at least with a general 
 approach.
 So to me it seems we do very well with a very simple scheme and as I 
 understand all SMP networking will benefit from this.
 Our "field-test" indicates that the packet load is still well distributed 
 among the CPU's.
 So maybe the showstopper comes out as a showwinner. :-)
 Cheers.
