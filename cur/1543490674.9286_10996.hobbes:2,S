If you have read my other posts you have found me agreeing violently. I
think we should not only have a per-scheduling entity, that entity should
also have a small set of "local" requests associated with it. 
Btw, the scheduling entity also needs a spinlock associated with it (so
that we can get rid of the current IO spinlock that is used around all
IO). So it's actually more than just the request queue: it's a "request
data structure" with a local queue and some local data structures. 
Finally, to get rid of the dirty block deadlock problem, you may want to
make the dirty blocks the same kind of per-entity list. This has another
advantage: the controller can choose to _pull_ dirty blocks from the dirty
queue instead of just getting them pushed onto its request queue. That
would allow devices to do some limited "Oh, I'm idle now, let me just
start to clean some buffers rather than wait for them being force-fed to
me".
So the thing should look something like this:
 - IO spinlock to synchronize that entity
 - separate read and write queues
 - some local request data structures (with a global overflow in order to
   allow better resource use).
(and it should probably ahve a nice descriptive name field too, along with
statistics, so that /proc can finally show nice per-disk IO stats).
Anything else? The kitchen sink, and we want to paint it a nice bright
yellow.
