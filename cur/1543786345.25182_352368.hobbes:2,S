Other pages in the VMA may be unmapped, yes, but not freed. In fact, they're 
kept in by the pagecache reference; try_to_unmap() (or better its caller, 
shrink_list) will only actually free the page it asked for.
The only real "problem" is that we do ptep_clear_flush_young without 
activating the page. And yes, *this* may penalize who holds a nonlinear VMA. 
But this is probably fair, given that we're going to have trouble in freeing 
those pages.

Yes.
