Maybe I'm getting over-confident here, but it seems like this could also be
explained by probe_cmos_for_drives().  The setup.S code reads the BIOS FDP
table data for the first two drives only, so it will have older-style (loads
of heads, fewer cylinders) numbers for hda and hdb.  On the other hand,
subsequent drives can only be found via the more modern methods in
do_identify().
A couple of tests you could do:
- if hdc has been formatted by a non-Linux program, see if fdisk complains
about its partitioning (BIOS format not matching drive format)
- swap hda and hdc.  My guess is that the two 16GB drives will appear
identical, and that the 10GB drive will appear to have about 19630
cylinders.
