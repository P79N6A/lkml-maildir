Jeff,
Good, this was the exact response that I was hoping for, as I've been told to
convince Adaptec to drop the binary RAID drivers in favor of helping out dmraid
development instead.  That process will probably be difficult, but at least I
now have incontrovertible proof that nobody will bend over backwards to support
them and that dmraid is the way to go.  Not that I'm terribly surprised by this.
I would, however, like to apologize for all this churlishness.  Hopefully some
day I won't have to deal with these binary modules altogether, and I won't have
to resort to such methods to get vendors to Do the Right Thing(tm).
--D
(A pity that dmraid doesn't do hostraid right now, otherwise none of this would
be necessary.)
