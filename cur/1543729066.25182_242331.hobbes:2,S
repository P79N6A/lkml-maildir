It for sure is possible.
However the DRM codebase proves that it's incapable of even doing BSD
support properly (eg without the right abstractions but instead fouling up
the entire codebase to the point of unreadability). That gives me no
confidence the "keep 2.4 support" will not turn out to be at least as
ugly/broken/wrong.
