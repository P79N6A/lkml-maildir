Thanks. Please put this into the commit description for future

So perhaps a simple lock serializing creation of new pdflush threads
would avoid the problem?

That makes some sense, but perhaps it would be better to base the default
size on the number of underlying block devices then?
Ok one issue there is that there are lots of different types of 
block devices, e.g. a big raid array may look like a single disk.
Still I suspect defaults based on the block devices would do reasonably
well.

The kernel should know the current machine config and most 
admins don't really want to do very fine grained configuration;
they expect the system to perform well out of the box. That is
why it is adventageous to try to come up with good auto tuning.

No problem, but I think you're confusing me with someone else :). I don't
remember ever hacking on this. Perhaps you thought of Andrew Morton
who did pdflush originally.
