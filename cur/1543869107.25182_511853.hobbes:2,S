???
So you are told me that if my PPS source is connected with a single
CPU GPIO I have to add a new driver to the kernel? I have to choose a
proper major/minor numbers for just one PIN? =:-o

But not PPS one. In several embedded systems the GPS antenna is
connected with the serial port and the PPS source, which cames from
the __same__ GPS antenna, is connected with a GPIO.
How I should manage such case? Which fildes I should use? Also
consider that NTPD currently manage only one filedes which should
support both GPS antenna's data and PPS source. My patch can solve
this problem.
Ciao,
