  For what it's worth, here is my experience. Hope it helps you, and 
anyone else searching for solutions to the problems I have encountered...
  Our New Server
  ==============
(+ Lessons learnt along the way)
   ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Motherboard: Asus P4S8X-X
CPU:         Intel Pentium 4 2400MHz
Memory:     2 x 512Mb PC2700
  +was supposed to be 3x512Mb but the motherboard can't handle 3xPC2700
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Network:     3Com  3c905C-TX/TX-M [Tornado]
             Do NOT use the onboard LAN - performance is diabolical!
            ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Additional controller cards:
	   2xPromise Ultra133 Tx2 PCI-IDE cards
	   1xPromise Ultra66      PCI-IDE card
   Do note use 3 identical Promise IDE cards, either system will not
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  boot or there will be i/o errors!
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Disks
=====
  (In addition to system disk)
  10 x Maxtor 6Y060L0 60Gb
           attached to onboard ide and Promise Ultra133 cards
  4  x Maxtor 4A250J0 240Gb disk
           attached to Promise Ultra66 cards
Software:
  RedHat 9
  kernel  2.4.20
  Boot parameters modified as follows:
Edit  /boot/grub/menu.lst
and append
  ide2=noautotune ide3=noautotune ide4=noutotune ide5=noautotune
ide6=noautotune ide7=noautotune
to the line
  kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.4.20-8 ro root=LABEL=/
  this avoids errors of the type:
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  hdh: dma_intr: bad DMA status (dma_stat=75)
  when accessing the disks on the Promise cards
					
					
  Thereafter formatted disks/created raid arrays/started raid/made 
filesystem no problem.   Four 240Gb disks formatted as one big disk via 
raid0!
  (/dev/md8 Size=989GB)			
					
Tape drive: Spectra Logic 2000 (a.k.a. TreeFrog) attached via
              Adaptec AIC-7892A SCSI card
             Use mtx version 1.2.17rel to drive the robot, more recent
            versions cause problems (author informed).
