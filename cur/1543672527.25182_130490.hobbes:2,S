   You just broke the userland ABI which must not happen.  at all.  That's
   why userland having older headers is fine.
   
Wrong, the ABI in the 2.5.x IPSEC stuff is not cast in
stone yet.
What about if I extend stuff without breaking the ABI?
How do apps get at the new features?
   That's why we want the glibc-kernheader package.  Or even better
   a package of headers that can be used by the kernel and userland,
   but this would require people to properly sort out kernel header
   functionality like internal structures and prototypes/inlines from
   the actual ABI-relevant contents.  The networking headers currently
   are very bad on this.
   
Yes, this is one way to deal with it.
Actually, if you look, things like include/linux/xfrm.h are excellent
examples of userland compatible kernel headers :-)
