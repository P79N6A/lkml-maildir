Yeah, major 8 should actually allow 16 devices (256 minor numbers, each disk uses
16 [1st for the whole
disk and the rest for the partitions] which allows 16 devices).
Documentation/devices.txt should show the
major numbers that are now used for the rest of the SCSI disks (devices.tex was
removed a couple
version ago, IIRC).  Really you should be fine once you add the device nodes
(whole disk minors being:
0,16,32,48,64,80, 96, etc.)  and it should be good.  The other major numbers
start at 65.
You can always cat /proc/scsi/scsi to make sure that linux did, in fact, find all
the disks which are there.
