gcc tends to place data such as strings or jump tables generated from
switches not into a place were it would be easily discardable.  The
latter is the reason that on MIPS we can't discard __exit functions
at all - a switch table in .rodata might be referencing discarded code
in .exit.text which makes ld fail.  When I discussed this with some gcc
people a while ago nobody really had a good suggestion to solve this.
