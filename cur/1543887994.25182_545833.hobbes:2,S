Subject: [PATCH] revert "cancel_delayed_work: use del_timer() instead of del_timer_sync()"
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As pointed out by Jarek Poplawski, the patch
	[WORKQUEUE]: cancel_delayed_work: use del_timer() instead of del_timer_sync()
	commit: 071b638689464c6b39407025eedd810d5b5e6f5d
was wrong, it was merged by mistake after that.
From the changelog:
	after this patch:
		...
		delayed_work_timer_fn->__queue_work() in progress.
		The latter doesn't differ from the caller's POV,
it does make a difference if the caller calls flush_workqueue() after
cancel_delayed_work(), in that case flush_workqueue() can miss this
work_struct.
