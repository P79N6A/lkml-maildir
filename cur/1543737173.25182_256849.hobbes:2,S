The mozilla behaviour is RFC compliant[1]. Use text/plain attachments
and mark them "to view" and it should do happier things. (Except with
Linus cos Mr Dinosaur[2] doesn't believe in MIME yet)
I've not been able to coax Evolution into not chewing on non attached
text either (again RFC compliant but not useful). If anyone knows a
magic incantation for it I'd love to know.
(and it might be a good addition to the lkml faq)
