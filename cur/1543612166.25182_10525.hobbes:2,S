There's more than enough memory on the system, as far as I can see
[root@linuxserver ext2]# free
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:        381500     378136       3364          0       3552     333348

Anyway - I beleive I should have seen some change by trying virtually any
value from 31 to 4095.
If the readahead is what I beleive it is, It'll read further out in the
file when a request comes. It looks like either this never happens, or the
next request doesn't 'know' how much is cached.
