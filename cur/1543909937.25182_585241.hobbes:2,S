Subject: [PATCH 000 of 6] A few block-layer tidy-up patches.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/16/124

Following are 5 patches which - I think - clean up various bits and pieces
in the block layer.
The only part that might be seen as a function change rather than
simply rearranging code is in ps3disk where bvec_kmap_irq is used
instead of bio_kmap_atomic (so interrupts are disabled).
The only other user of bvec_kmap_irq is ide-floppy.c.  If that does
need to disable interrupts, and ps3disk doesn't, make the disabling of
interrupts should be separated from the kmapping??
Thanks,
NeilBrown
