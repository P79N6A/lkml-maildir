Yes.  Although the problem can't be due to a race if it involves code 
that's protected by a semaphore.
Did this Badness message come from within check_perm()?  I don't see how
that could happen with this patch.  You're guaranteed that the refcount is
positive until after sysfs_remove_dir() returns.  It's _supposed_ to be
positive, anyway; maybe it isn't.  You could try checking for that, at the
end of sysf_remove_dir().

You're quite correct.  d_fsdata must remain set so that previous
references can be dropped.  Some other part of the dentry or the inode has
to be used instead.  I don't know what would be appropriate, perhaps one 
of the flags bits.
