I don't think so; SIGPWR sent to init means it should shut down the
system as soon as possible.  If init dies, the system gets uncleanly
shut down, but less uncleanly than a power interruption (at least the
disks are idled.)  Therefore this is eminently sensible.

I would still like to suggest these two getting recycled as SIGTHREAD1
and SIGTHREAD2, for LinuxThreads to use.

This is just wrong: Linux stops if the handler is default on TSTP,
TTIN, and TTOU which is perfectly correct behaviour.  If what you had
up there was true, ^Z would kill your process.
