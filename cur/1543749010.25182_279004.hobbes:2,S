You do it the wrong way, though. This is not safe:
	if (__kernel_text_address(regs->eip) && *(char *)regs->eip == 0xf4)
does _entirely_ the wrong thing if CS is not the kernel CS. 
It can trigger with a regular use CS if you were to run the 4G:4G patches, 
but more realistically, I think you can make ii trigger even with a 
standard kernel by creating a local code segment in your LDT, and then 
trying to confuse the kernel that way.
Now, as long as the _only_ thing it does is increment the eip, the worst 
that can happen is that it screws over the user program that must have 
worked at this a bit, but the basic point is that you shouldn't do this. 
In _theory_ you could confuse a real program that wasn't doing anything 
bad.
Checking for kernel CS also requires checking that it's not vm86 mode, 
btw. So that's not just a "regs->xcs & 0xffff == __KERNEL_CS" either.
But something like
	static inline int kernel_mode(struct pt_regs *regs)
	{
		return !((regs->eflags & VM_MASK) | (regs->xcs & 3));
	}
should DTRT.
Can you pls double-check my thinking, and test?
