This reminds me of a problem I had, which I'd forgotten about, maybe
it's related:
I was using a 7N1, (that's not a typo, it really was 7N1), 9600 bps
serial terminal, and from the shell prompt I connected to a remote
machine using 8N1.  I logged in successfully, but the shell didn't
work, yet setting the local serial terminal to 8N1 made it work (!).
After logging out from the remote machine, I had to set the serial
terminal back to 7N1 to use the local machine.
Can anybody else reproduce this?  My serial terminal is currently out
of service, (needs some wires soldered on a DB9 connector :-) ).
John.
