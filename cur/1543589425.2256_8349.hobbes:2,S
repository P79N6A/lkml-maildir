Ouch.  I just re-read the man page and it doesn't caution (*) against
using it on mounted filesystems.  That probably means that there are
thousands of other losers like me using it on production machines. 
Volunteers to (a) change the man page, (b) talk to the distros about
dumping "dump"?

Yup, sounds good.
Neil
(*) The KNOWNBUGS file mentions "possible" problems while dumping active
mounted filesystems, but I've (elsewhere) seen these characterised as no
real problem; also, this falls a long way short of discouraging use in
this fashion.
