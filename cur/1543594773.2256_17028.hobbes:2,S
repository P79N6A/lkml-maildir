Care to elaborate? It's an application programming language, not a
kernel hacker language, you know.
I won't call Java the perfect solution for everything, but it's an
useful tool for a certain type of applications.

Thanks buddy. I've seen too many "#ifdef _SOLARIS_ || _LINUX &&
!_X86_" definition deserts to not wanting to do this again. Portability 
without os-specific tweaks for more than two or three platforms is a dream.
And most if not all commercial platforms don't come with perl, python,
tcl/tk or anything else installed. Many even without a (C-)compiler. 
Most without a C++-compiler.
