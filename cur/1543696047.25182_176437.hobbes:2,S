Hello!
   [ I beleive this is real FAQ - so responding with private e-mails 
more appropriate.
     ptr("RTFM") != 0 are welcome. ]
   jiffies declared in kernel/timer.c.
   Name suggests that it is incremented 100 times per second.
   LDD2 suggests that it is incremented every 1000/HZ per second.
   Is it just name misleading - or I really miss the point?
   So to translate this to seconds i need (jiffies*1000/HZ)
   and milliseconds are just (jiffies/HZ) then.
   Am I right?
   I need this for {add,mod}_timer() calls.
