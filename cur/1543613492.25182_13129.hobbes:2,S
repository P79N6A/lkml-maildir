Hi. Thanks for the reply!
I'm sorry tht I can not do many other benchmarks - since the server is
in production ...

This might make a difference? Maybe the open() call but read/write on
a open fd ??

Did you tryed ReiserFS on a software raid device?

There is a Raid5 on top of 3 discs running ReiserFS (the performance is
bad ...)
But here are the results of a dd if=/bla bla/disc
A single disk:
server1:~ # time dd if=/dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 of=/dev/zero bs=1000000 count=200
200+0 records in
200+0 records out
real    0m7.106s
user    0m0.030s
sys     0m3.640s
=>28.1 MB/s
And parallel read from two mastess:
server1:~ # time dd if=/dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 of=/dev/zero bs=1000000 count=200
200+0 records in
200+0 records out
real    0m12.797s
user    0m0.010s
sys     0m4.210s
=>15.6 MB/s
And parallel read from master/slave:
server1:~ # time dd if=/dev/ide/host2/bus0/target0/lun0/part1 of=/dev/zero bs=1000000 count=200
200+0 records in
200+0 records out
real    0m18.427s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m2.690s
=>10.85 MB/s

I do not understand? No concurrency? The two reads are fighting for the
same IDE channel the whole time ... ?

OK. Above are some raw-read numbers. Currently the disc are in a RAID5
setup with ReiserFS on top - running in production ...
The ReiserFS is realy realy realy slow (reported in another thread).
We might add a 4th disc an reconfigure it leaving some Gigs on each
disc for tests - but not in this year ...
