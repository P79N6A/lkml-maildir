Why don't we change /dev/mem to use io_remap_page_range unconditionally
for ranges above high_memory? Clearly io_remap_page_range can map device
space, and I guess that's what io_remap_page_range is there for. sparc
and sparc64 are the only two ones implementing io_remap_page_range, so
maybe Dave or Wli can tell us if there's any penalty in using
io_remap_page_range in mmap(/dev/mmap) for phys ranges above
high_memory. I don't know the sparc architectural details of mk_pte_io
invoked by io_remap_page_range of the sparc arch.
There's also an issue with io_remap_page_range where sparc has 6 args
while everyone else has 5 args. It's perfectly fine that sparc will be
the only one parsing the last value, but we should pass that last value
to all archs, so that people can avoid writing code like the below
(drivers/char/drm):
#ifdef __sparc__
		if (io_remap_page_range(DRM_RPR_ARG(vma) vma->vm_start,
					VM_OFFSET(vma) + offset,
					vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start,
					vma->vm_page_prot, 0))
#else
		if (remap_pfn_range(DRM_RPR_ARG(vma) vma->vm_start,
				     (VM_OFFSET(vma) + offset) >> PAGE_SHIFT,
				     vma->vm_end - vma->vm_start,
				     vma->vm_page_prot))
#endif
Thanks.
