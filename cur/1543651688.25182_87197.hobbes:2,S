Note the difference between LVM (the tools, the on-disk format, etc) and
device-mapper (simply a generic interface in the kernel).  I suspect the
disasterous LVM experiences you've had were either with LVM1 (which did
not use device-mapper), or with some aspect of LVM2's userspace stuff
(which, I have yet to hear of any major problems with, other than
important features like pvmove not yet being implemented).  There's no
reason why EVMS would need to emulate similar behavior.
