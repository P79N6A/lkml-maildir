I slept on it, and I still think 'nosubmnt' might be the best
compromise.  Obviously the superuser has privileges, that override
what is normally allowed, and we don't find it strange when a
read-only file is happily being written by root.
It may feel wrong in the context of mounts, because we are so used to
mounts being privileged-only.
Objections?  Once this goes in, it will stay the same forever, so now
is the time to express any doubts...
Thanks,
