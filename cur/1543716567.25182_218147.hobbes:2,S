You should never recommend anything from me to anyone if you want to
keep some friends :-)

It was intentionnal, I don't like to change the default kernel behaviour.
So by default it's 0 and behaves as if the patch was not applied. However,
I think that a very small value (a few seconds) may be acceptable by default.
Of course, if Bill doesn't use the patch anywhere else, he should be fine
with a higher value.
Another (dirty) hack would be to export this variable, keep it to 0 by
default, and have usb_hub_thread() set it to a reasonable value when
starting khubd.
Regards,
Willy
