Hi All,
We have a custom driver which runs on Red Hat Advanced Server 2.1(kernel
version 2.4.9-e.3).
On loading  the driver (using insmod) and running our configuration program,
we got folowing warning message "do_IRQ: stack overflow: 1786" and along
with the stack trace.
The configuration program, however, ran successfully.
On going through the do_IRQ code in arch/i386/kernel/irq.c we found that is
is used for debugging check for stack overflow i.e if the stack size is less
than 2KB free.
There is no similar debugging check in other kernels like 2.4.7-10,2.4.18-3
and 2.4.18-14.
What is the significance of this debugging information and why other kernels
dont have the same check? Also, if the stack overflow can cause future
problems, then
how can we increase the stack size? Thanks in advance for any information on
this.
Thanks and Regards
Chandrasekhar
