Only if you have that version of gcc still installed on your PC. You'll
likely need the appropriate -b or even -B command line option, though.

my 'gcc' binary defaults to 2.7.2.3, but if i want to invoke, say,
pgcc-2.91.60, i'd have to use 'gcc -Vpgcc-2.91.60 -bi686-pc-linux-gnu'.

Configure checks enviroment though. You can do any of these:
(bash/sh, possibly other sh-alikes)

or

or

		-bi486-rms-lignux -O42 -fno-inline" [*]

You can also set the 'CFLAGS' env variable for the options, i can imagine
that is considered slightly 'cleaner'.

[*]: Yes, your system would have to be really sick to have such a setup...
but it would be amusing trying to find out which utilities are able to
cope with it and which aren't. :)
