Rik,
Just installed ac7 and after some 30 minutes of unpacking
kernel-sources and diffing patches, I left my computer unattended
for about 1 hour. When I came back the system was unusable (like it 
was frozen), and /var/log/messages just displayed messages of the
type:
Feb  8 22:54:40 fry kernel: Out of Memory: Killed process 455 (xmms).
...
The OOM killer killed most of my apps, and finally X. I had to reboot
in order to get the system back. I've been running ac1-ac6 since they
came out with no problems, so I guess its the VM hack that is buggy.
This is on an AMD K7 1200Mhz, 512MB Ram, ATA100. Nothing big was
running at the time (xchat, xmms, mozilla, gnome, x, a few xterms).
I'll do some more testing tomorrow and provide any further information
you might need.
