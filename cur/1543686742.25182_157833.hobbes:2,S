I don't want to upgrade SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN to SLAB_MUST_HWCACHE_ALIGN 
depending on GFP_DMA: IIRC one arch (ppc64?) marks everything as 
GFP_DMA, because all memory is DMA capable.
Which arch do you use? Perhaps alignment could be added for broken archs.
Actually I think you should fix your arch, perhaps by double buffering 
in pci_map_ if the input pointers are not aligned. What if someone uses 
O_DIRECT with an unaligned pointer?
