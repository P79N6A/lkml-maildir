This needs to be done some other way. The dirty bit should not be
significant for pseudofs's with no backing store. The consequences
of making it so are becoming apparent in the IO path, and it
caused performance regressions elsewhere as well. ramfs, for instance,
doesn't require anything of this sort to cope with drop_caches.
