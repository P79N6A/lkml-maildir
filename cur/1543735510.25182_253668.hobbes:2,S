Ok, here is what I found:
The patch for hid-input to convert tilt events to HWHEEL:
http://www.t12.jp/~ryuta/misclab/debian/release/hidinput-tiltwheel-quirk-for-linux-2.6.7.patch
I am not sure who the author is as I do not know Japanese.
The patches for XFree86/XOrg allowing to get data from /dev/input/eventX
can be extracted from the floowing:
http://cudlug.cudenver.edu/gentoo/distfiles/xorg-x11-6.8.0-patches-0.2.tar.bz2
Look for patches 9000, 9001 and 9002. As far as I can see it will allow using
wheel to do horizontal scrolling as well.
