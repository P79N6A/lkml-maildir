Craig,
You have pointed out, very delicately, a major limitation of Ethernet as
it is implemented today. I find myself constantly arguing against
implementation of gig Ethernet due to the high CPU cost on the host
system. Trying to fill a gig pipe with 1,514 byte packets is, IMHO,
maddening to the CPU. As I recall, the host must be able to process
around 82,000 packets (read "CPU interrupts") per second to fill the
pipe unidirectionally. Try this in a full duplex setting with a 2 gig
pipe to fill and you (at least) double the amount of work the CPU needs
to accomplish every second. 
Since no one seems to want to jump on the 8K jumbo frames bandwagon
Alteon has embraced, current technology and CPU speeds seem to indicate
more "bang for the buck" with a couple of trunked Fast Ethernet links.
The last thing one wants to do, no matter what NOS you choose, is
overrun the host CPU. Depending on the environment, it may even be less
expensive when all things are considered to implement a Token Ring
solution!
Personally, I recommend one of the following to my clients. 
1. If Token Ring / Fast Token Ring is implemented anywhere in the
enterprise, keep it. If the client absolutely wants client segments as
Ethernet, move the Token Ring hardware to the data center and implement
switched 10 (or 100 iff Fast TR in the DC) Ethernet to the clients. 
2. If there are no implementations of Token Ring, go gig with Jumbo
Frames in the DC and spend the $$$ on the edge devices to convert the
packets back to 1514 bytes. Client segments still use "Classic" Ethernet
packets and don't need the high end ACEnic's.
Either of these scenarios provides an adequate solution to getting the
data out of the DC as quickly as possible.
