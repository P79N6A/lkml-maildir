As long as we are considering indirecting system calls, how about
reviving your proposal to run a system call in a different address
space:

UML could make good use of the ability to remotely manipulate address
spaces.  I never liked any of the proposed interfaces very much,
including mm_indirect.  However, if my tastebuds are defective, and
indirecting system calls is the way to solve a family of problems,
then we should look at fitting in mm_indirect.

mm_indirect would need a file descriptor to the other address space,
which we would presumably get from a new get_mm() system call.
