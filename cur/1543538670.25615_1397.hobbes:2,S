Problem is that you have to age all pages, at some point the newly read
pages will be older than the almost never reused ones.
Note: You can not avoid ageing all pages. If not an easy attack would be
to reread some pages over and over... (they would never go away...)
Someone mentioned the 2Q algorithm earlier - pages had to prove
themselves
to get added in the first place. Interesting approach.
