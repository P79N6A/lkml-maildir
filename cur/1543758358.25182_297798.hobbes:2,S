You can't use kernel headers in user-mode functions. For one thing,
they bring in undefined stuff.
Your user mode code can, of course get the definition of errno
by #include <errno.h>. That's the errno that exists in every user-
mode 'C' program-developed process space. However, if get_rmt_paging
is not one of your functions, you are in trouble by mixing up
user-mode and kernel-mode headers.
Normally, the return value of a kernel function is checked and
if it's negative, the positive equivalent is put into the global
variable errno and then the return value is changed to -1. This
is where the user-mode reference to errno occurs.
