Now rebooted, with this command line to the kernel:
Kernel command line: ro root=/dev/VolGroup00/LogVol00 rhgb 
dm-mod.major=238 dm.major=238 selinux=0
Unknown boot option `dm-mod.major=238': ignoring
Unknown boot option `dm.major=238': ignoring
So its still at FE00h/65024d.
And I fixed the underscore to a dash in my modprobe.conf, now I'll do 
another mkinitrd & reboot again.
