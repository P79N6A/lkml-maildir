Yeah, I'd like my servers to play different theme tunes for incoming
ISDN and modem connections (beats modem warbles :-) ) and have them
multicast TV and radio around the local net (so that people could
watch the business programs, of course...). Clients and servers
are not *physically* separated, they are *logically* separated.
This is why a workstation typically runs an NFS *client* but
an X *server*. Ignore Microsoft's ramblings :-).
