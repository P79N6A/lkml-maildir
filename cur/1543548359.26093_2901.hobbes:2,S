Taking his base analogy, it's no different that setting up a shop
that uses iron planes, or wood planes, or adzes, or maybe reverting
all the way back to simple stone tools.  You draw the line
somewhere to attact a certain type of person interesting in
producing a certain result.
Besides, I assume anyone working on the kernel can get a debugger
patch and be running in a few minutes.  Or maybe not?  I've never
downloaded a kernel debugger.
