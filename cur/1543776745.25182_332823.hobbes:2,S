Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/7/10/201

Why per node? Why not go the whole way and make it per CPU?
I would also not define it statically, but allocate it at boot time
in node local memory.
