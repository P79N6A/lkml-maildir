Yup, the AIO threads run the same code as for regular IO, i.e in the rare
situations where they actually end up submitting IO, so there should
be no problem. And you have already added plug/unplug at the appropriate
places in those path, so things should just work.

I think aio-stress would be a good way to test/benchmark this sort of
stuff, at least for a start. 
Samba (if I understand this correctly based on my discussions with Tridge)
is less likely to generate the kind of io patterns that could benefit from
explicit plugging (because the file server has no way to tell what the next
request is going to be, it ends up submitting each independently instead of
batching iocbs).
In future there may be optimization possibilities to consider when
submitting batches of iocbs, i.e. on the io submission path. Maybe
AIO - O_DIRECT would be interesting to play with first in this regardi ?
