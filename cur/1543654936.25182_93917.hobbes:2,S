Subject: [Bug? - HRT] clock_settime w/tp out of bounds
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Here's another bug report for the high-res-timers project from my running
the POSIX Test Suite Timers tests against the high-res-timers
implementation.
Description:  clock_settime() is not failing as expected when tp has a
nanosecond value < 0 or >= 1000 million.
Details:
The POSIX spec (2001 - lines 6659-6660; 1993 - lines 127-128) states that if
a struct timespec *tp is passed that has a nanosecond value < 0 or >= 1000
million, the clock_settime() function will fail with errno EINVAL and return
-1.
In the high-res-timers implementation, if tp.tv_nsec is < 0 or >= 1000
million, the function returns 0 and sets the time as if tv_nsec were a valid
value.
Additional information is below:
kernel used = 2.5.50
HRT patches applied =
  hrtimers-posix-2.5.50-1.0.patch
  hrtimers-core-2.5.50-1.0.patch
  hrtimers-i386-2.5.50-1.0.patch
  hrtimers-hrposix-2.5.50-1.0.patch
relevant lines of .config =
  CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y
  # CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMER_ACPI_PM is not set
  CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMER_TSC=y
  # CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMER_PIT is not set
I have created one large test case which reproduces the issue on various
nsec values < 0 and >= 1000 (19-1.c).  Note:  Because it actually sets the
time, if it is run, you'll need to sync your time back to the correct time
at the end.
Compiled with:
gcc -g -O2 -Wall -Werror 19-1.c -L/lib/libposixtime.so -lposixtime
**These views are not necessarily those of my employer.**
Test 19-1.c - also on-line at (sorry about the breaks):

 * Test that clock_settime() sets errno=EINVAL if tp has a nsec value < 0 or
 * >= 1000 million.
 *
 * Test calling clock_settime() with the following tp.tv_nsec values:
 *   MIN INT = INT32_MIN
 *   MAX INT = INT32_MAX
 *   MIN INT - 1 = 2147483647  (this is what gcc will set to)
 *   MAX INT + 1 = -2147483647 (this is what gcc will set to)
 *   unassigned value = -1073743192 (ex. of what gcc will set to)
 *   unassigned value = 1073743192 (ex. of what gcc will set to)
 *   -1
 *   1000000000
 *   1000000001
 *
 * The clock_id CLOCK_REALTIME is used.
