Hi.
I've made upgrade 2.0.36 up to 2.2.1 on all my machines. All of them are fine, excluding one.
That machine boots and works normally, but on rebooting fully hangs. It's hardware configuration: motherboard - ASUSTEK-PCI/E-P54NP4, 2 IntelPentium-120 processors, AHA-2940, old Trident videocard, 3c509, ZNYX, etc.
Then I tried to downgrade machine to detect bad hardware. Downgraded configuration was: 1 Intel Pentium-120 processor, no SCSI, no IDE, no ethernet. Just motherboard, FDC and video. Booting this system with 2.2.1 floppy has the same error on rebooting... Previous stable kernels worked just fine on this machine.
Thanks.
