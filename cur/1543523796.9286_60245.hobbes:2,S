Well then I suggest fixing it instead ;-)

I don't think understand this one, sorry.

The problem of putting them in front is that you may set a register
and you have no idea when the operation will take place, thus the card
may run with stale information in it's registers for a while. With
regard to filling the cursor then that particular example is not very
good since opdating the cursor data is rarely a performance critical
item ;-) However even for the performance critical cases (like
printing data on the screen), you'd rather use the
__raw_{read,write}l() macros and explicitly add the [wm]mb() macros.

Why is it not fixed then? Or is there a reason for this, ie. does it
need a "sync" on rmb for the SMP case of writing pointers to real
memory. In that case we may need tp add pci_[rw]mb() instead.

I never got far enough in the PPC User's Manual to comment on how the
specific instructions work. However if {read,write}l() is done as
inline macros you still let the compiler optimize away. Though, even
if they are not, then the calculations you perform to get to the
proper address are quickly lost in the noise of the time it actually
takes to access the PCI shared memory.
