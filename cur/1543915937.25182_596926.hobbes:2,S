Each of them on top of 2.6.23-rc6 gives the same symptoms as rc6-hrt2 (ie. the
box doesn't boot).
I'm going to check if -rc5 with patch-2.6.23-rc4-hrt1 on top of it works and
if not (I suspect so), I'll bisect the Linus' tree between -rc4 and -rc5 in
order to identify the responsible patch.
Greetings,
Rafael
