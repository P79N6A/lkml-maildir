Subject: 2.4.10 much better than previous 2.4.x :-)

This is mainly a thank you for 2.4.10. It performs much better than
2.4.7 (RedHat version), from which I upgraded. Interactive performance
for applications (Gnome, Evolution, Mozilla) is much improved, and my
swap load is at zero, which is probably where it should be (2.4.7 would
regularly be using 256MB of swap with the same applications running).
Thanks!
