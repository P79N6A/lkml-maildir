Con simply isn't available right now, but you're right. RSDL isn't ready yet, 
imho, there seem to be some regressions (and I'm bitten by them, too). But if 
con's past behaviour says anything about how he's going to behave in the 
future (and according to my psych prof it's the most reliable predictor ;-)), 
I'm pretty sure he'll jump on this when he's healthy again. He's gone through 
great lengths to fix problems with staircase, no matter how obscure, so I see 
no reason why he wouldn't do the same for RSDL... Though scheduler problems 
can be extremely hard to reproduce on other hardware.
