Maybe some of the confusion arises, because the are actually two 
timezones: Userland, to convert UTC to localtime, and kernelland to 
convert UTC to RTC ;-) Both are "a bit related". I don't see why a 
user program should have to mess with the RTC stuff, but we exchanged 
arguments already.

But many systems set the RTC while running Win*ooze. That will affect 
Linux time then.

That was what I had in mind roughly.

Hmm.. signed offset of RTC from UTC, wouldn't that be enough?

The offset is a plain number every instant of time. Occasionally it 
changes, but this is not the kernels task to do that (the change). 
The kernel just does what is has been told to do (update the RTC or 
not, but do that correctly).
