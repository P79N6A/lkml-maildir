No.... The simplest thing is for the server to actually abide by the
RFCs and not generate filehandles that change on reboot.
NFSv4 is the ONLY version of the protocol that actually supports the
concept of filehandles that have a finite lifetime.

It won't if the root filehandle is broken too. That is the standard way
of telling the NFS client that the administrator has revoked our access
to the filesystem.
The solution is simple here: fix the broken server...
