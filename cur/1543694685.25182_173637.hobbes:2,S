Not sure about other vendors, but a fatal write on a maxtor means we
couldn't do your write after exhausting all attempts at reallocation,
recertification, etc.  If you ever get this on a drive, either:
1) the drive is unable to reallocate any more blocks because it has run out
of spares
or
2) the drive was attempting those writes under environmental conditions that
it was unable to handle. (extreme shock&vibe, <5C, >55C, etc)

From my understanding, most returns are due to damaged heads (some small
percent burn up over time) or operational shock "head/media events" where
someone bumped a running drive and the head dug a crater in the media.  Any
particulate contamination can be struck by the heads causing high-fly write
events.  (head bounces up off the media in the middle of a write).  I
haven't heard of bearing wear being a common issue... all drives these days
use fluid bearings.  Early fluid bearings had outgassing issues at high
temperature, but I think those problems were solved by manufacturers long
before the first drives using them hit store shelves.
All in all, they're rather delicate.  I'm amazed they work at all too.
