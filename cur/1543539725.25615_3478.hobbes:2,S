What for ? On 99% systems (if not 99.999% system - all system with CAP_SYS_RAW
in system OR with boot device accessible for write for root) out there
malicious root CAN change RUNNING kernel as much as he(she) want or can
insert dmage code in bootsector to destroy your drive on next boot.

You missed small yet imortant fact shown above.
