You shouldn't have to try to scan the set of all tasks in any bounded
period of time or rely on differential updates. Scanning some part of
the list of a bounded size, updating the state based on what was
scanned, and reporting the rest as if it hadn't changed is the strategy
I'm describing.

Some updates can be captured, merely not all. Updating the state given
what was captured during the partial scan and then displaying the state
derived from what could be captured in the refresh interval is more
useful than being nonfunctional at the lower refresh intervals or
needlessly beating the kernel in some futile attempt to exhaustively
search an impossibly huge dataset in some time bound that can't be
satisfied.

One shouldn't really need to care; periodically rechecking the fields
of an active pid should suffice. You don't really care whether it's the
same task or not, just that the fields are up-to-date and whether any
task with that pid exists.

Actually, the problem size is so small it shouldn't be problematic.
There are only 13 /proc/ files associated with a process, so exhaustive
search over 2**13 - 1 == 8191 nonempty subsets, e.g. queueing by size
and checking for the satisfiability of the reporting, will suffice.
