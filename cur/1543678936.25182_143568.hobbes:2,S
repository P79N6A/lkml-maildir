Hello,
	I wonder if some kind soul could take a couple of minutes to
look at the thread at:
http://mail.nl.linux.org/kernelnewbies/2003-06/msg00385.html
(the subject is "How to determine linkage of a function at run-time?").
My post was replied to, but I think the person answering it knew about
as much about it as I do!  I have done a lot of googling and reading of
faqs, but still cannot find the answer to my question.
Thanks very much for your time.
Best wishes,
		Bill.
