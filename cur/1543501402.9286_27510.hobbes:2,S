Yes. You are correct. I tried it with several 'non-gcc, non-unix'
compilers and they seem to require that a switch include at least
one statement within it. A ';' will suffice. I don't know if this
is really ANSI, someone else will probably comment.
FYI lint finds nothing wrong with it. Further {} seems to be okay
as well as {;}, so I can't guess what rule is being violated.
Cheers,
