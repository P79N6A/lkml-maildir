It is weird tho. Could you try adding a printk or something to figure
out how much this is called during a typical swich ? It will seriously
spam your console though ... I would expect only 5 or 6 calls during a
normal switch (since the PLL value shouldn't change for a flat panel),
that is no more than maybe 50ms, while it seems you are having a much
bigger delay.
