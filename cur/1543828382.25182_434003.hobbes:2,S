OK.  That sucks.  A sufficiently large machine with the right mix of
latencies will get hit by the NMI watchdog in write_lock_irq().
But presumably the situation is much worse with CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK
because of that __delay().
So how about we remove the __delay() (which is wrong anyway, because
loops_per_jiffy isn't calculated with a write_trylock() in the loop (which
means we're getting scarily close to the NMI watchdog at present)).
Instead, calculate a custom loops_per_jiffy for this purpose in
lib/spinlock_debug.c?
