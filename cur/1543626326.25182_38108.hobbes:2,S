Subject: Raid5 resync slow with one linear array

Hi,
I just setup a 4 (5 really) drive raid5 array.
It is syncing up right now and nothing else is running on the system.
I have three 18GB SCA scsi drives and 2x9GB linear array in a four "drive"
raid5 array.
Unfortunately, it is syncing up quite slowly.  Only about 2MB/sec on a
40MB/sec array.  The system is idle.
2.4.19-pre4-ac3
Is there something about this config that says "Don't do that!"?  I've
heard about RAID10, but not Linear+RAID5...
This way, I get more space, and one filesystem (except a 50mb raid1 for
booting).
Thanks
Mike
