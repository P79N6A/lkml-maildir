I guess you will have to explain to me why that is supposed to be a
good thing to force people to go though their ISP.  I've had personal
experience where I returned to my University which forces everyone to
go though their mail spool and it took me a week or two before I
realized that any e-mail I sent off campus wasn't getting there and I
was using their mail services.  Turns out the university changed the
host names for our ip's and my hostname wasn't changed to reflect that
(stupid name I might add and not for human readability, the previous
ones were understandable.)
To this day I don't know what happened to those e-mails, I do know I
didn't get them and the desired people didn't get them.
There is a lot of comfort looking at /var/log/mail.log and seeing mail
accepted by the computer servicing the other person's account.  Now
all I have is, accepted by university, hope it gets there...
