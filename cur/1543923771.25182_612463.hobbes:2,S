I'm not so sure ifdef'ing things up all over the place is the way to
solve this.  It makes the code ultra ugly.
I think we should retain the check, but modify it so that GCC knows we
understand that it's OK if it is always false.  Perhaps a simple (u32)
cast on the left branch of the comparison is sufficient?
