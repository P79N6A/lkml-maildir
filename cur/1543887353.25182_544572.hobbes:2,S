set_tsk_need_resched which is the trigger for a cond_resched occurring won't 
be set just by a cpu bound task constantly running in the background as far 
as I can see. It's only if some wakeup has triggered a set_tsk_need_resched. 
ie prefetching still happens here with setiathome or equivalent running in my 
testing. It might be overkill but from what I can see here it is no 
impediment to prefetching occurring. I'll think about it some more and do 
more testing but it seems ok to me.
