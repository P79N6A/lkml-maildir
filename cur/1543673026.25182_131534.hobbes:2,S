Subject: [2.5 patch] remove all #include <blk.h>'s
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The attached patch (gzipped due to 100 kB linux-kernel limit) removes 
all #include <blk.h>'s for 2.5 and blk.h does now #error. If people 
want their drivers to run unmodified under 2.4 it might be necessary to 
do a
  #if LINUX_VERSION_CODE < KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,70)
  #include <linux/blk.h>
  #endif
I've tested the compilation in 2.5.69-bk4 with a .config that tries to
compile as much drivers as possible.
