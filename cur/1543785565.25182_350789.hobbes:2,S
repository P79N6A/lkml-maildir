Linux fret 2.6.14-rc1-git1 #1 Thu Sep 15 06:40:15 CDT 2005 i686 unknown unknown
GNU/Linux
        i have noticed that on tty1 only, once the initial boot-up
messages are cleared from the buffer no new output is looped to the
bottom of the screen; but a few tests with a couple of the other five
configured tty's has showed new buffer content continually copies to the
last few lines (plus a pixel or three).
        i commented the vga=290 boot option and the problem remains,
just fewer surprious lines appear.
