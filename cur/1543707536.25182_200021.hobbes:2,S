Well, the request queue of the kernel is max'ed out too, otherwise
get_request_wait() wouldn't be called. It's just an unfortunate timing issue.

Well, you would indeed expect the 3ware hardware to be smarter than that,
but in its defence, the driver doesn't set sdev->simple_tags or sdev->ordered_tags
at all. It just has a large queue on the host, in hardware.
Perhaps this info should be exported into the request queue of the device,
so that ll_rw_blk knows about this and can do something similar to the
hack I posted ?
Note that AFAICS nothing in drivers/scsi uses the tagging stuff in ll_rw_blk.c.
blk_queue_init_tags() is only called by scsi_activate_tcq(), and nothing
ever calls that (except the 53c700.c driver). So you can't just check for
QUEUE_FLAG_QUEUED. Hmm, nothing in drivers/block calls it either. It's
not being used at all yet ? Or am I being dense ?
Mike.
