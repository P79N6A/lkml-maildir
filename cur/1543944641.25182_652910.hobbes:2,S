I was taught formally that all procedures must be declared
before they are encountered in a file. This constitutes what
is generally known as "good standards of engineering practice."
It also guarantees a compiler diagnostic if the declaration and
the function doesn't match.
You should not remove things just because you don't think they
are necessary. They do no harm and removing them can cause
code checking tools to issue diagnostic messages.
Cheers,
