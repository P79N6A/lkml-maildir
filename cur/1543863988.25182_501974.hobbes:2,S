+2.14 /proc/<pid>/core_flags - Core dump control flags
+---------------------------------------------------------------------
+When a process is dumped, all anonymous memory is written to a core file as
+long as the size of the core file isn't limited. But sometimes we don't want
+to dump some memory segments, for example, huge shared memory.
+
+The /proc/<pid>/core_flags file enables you to omit some anonymous memory from
+a core file when it is generated. The content of the proc file is bitmask of
+memory segment types you don't want to dump. When the <pid> process is dumped,
+the core dump routine decides whether a given memory segment should be dumped
+into a core file or not, based on the type of the memory segment and bitmask.
+
+Currently, only valid bit is bit 0. If bit 0 is set, anonymous `shared' memory
+segments are not dumped. There are three types of anonymous shared memory:
+
+  - IPC shared memory
+  - the memory segments created by mmap(2) with MAP_ANONYMOUS and MAP_SHARED
+    flags
+  - the memory segments created by mmap(2) with MAP_SHARED flag, and the
+    mapped file has already been unlinked
+
+Because current core dump routine doesn't distinguish these segments, you can
+only choose either dumping all anonymous shared memory segments or not.
+
+If you don't want to dump all shared memory segments attached to pid 1234, set
+the bit 0 of the process's core_flags to 1:
+
+  $ echo 1 > /proc/1234/core_flags
+
+Additionally, you can check its hexadecimal value by reading the file:
+
+  $ cat /proc/1234/core_flags
+  00000001
+
+When a new process is created, the process inherits the core_flags setting
+from its parent. It is useful to set the core_flags before the program runs.
+For example:
+
+  $ echo 1 > /proc/self/core_flags
+  $ ./some_program
+
