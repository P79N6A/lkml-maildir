Yes, I am still thinking about how this would work. This would mean that 
the first cpu on a system would move busy processes to itself from all 
1023 other processes? That does not sound appealing.
Processes in the allnodes domain would move to processor #0. The next 
lower layer are the nodes groups. Not all of the groups at that layer 
contain processor #0. So we would never move processes into those sched 
domains?
