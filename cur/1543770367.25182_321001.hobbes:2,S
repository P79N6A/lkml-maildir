You looked at 'man diff', right?
and linux/Documentation/SubmittingPatches, which says:
Use "diff -up" or "diff -uprN" to create patches.
So you use the options that are appropriate for your patches.
If you are patching only one file (or a few files in the same
directory), -up is usually fine.
If you have patches in multiple directories and you want diff
to search in subdirectories for patches, you need to use -r
(recursive).
If you are adding new files, you need to use -N.
Is there a specific problem that you are trying to solve?
