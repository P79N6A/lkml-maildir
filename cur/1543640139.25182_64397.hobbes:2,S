after the mem_map is gone, there's still the option of CONFIG_2G or even
CONFIG_1G if kernel metadata is the problem. Of course it wouldn't be
a generic kernel, but I guess a 4G/4G would probably be even less
generic.  In short we can do little at runtime to be generic. I guess a
16G with large softpagesize should be not too bad now that the
pagetables are in highmem, most problematic is >16G. Not that the
softpagesize is easy at all to implement (4G/4G is certainly simpler
because self contained in the include/arch) but at least it can payoff
for the lower mem setups too.
