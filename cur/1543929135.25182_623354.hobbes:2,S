Seems like post_transform_command() call can be removed (patch below).

Would be great if somebody convert cdrom_newpc_intr() to use scatterlists
also for PIO transfers (ide_pio_sector() in ide-taskfile.c should serve
as a good starting base to see how to do PIO transfers using scatterlists)
so we could get rid of partial request completions in cdrom_newpc_intr()
and just fully complete request when the transfer is done.  Shouldn't be
difficult but I guess that we can live with blk_end_request_callback() for
the time being...

[PATCH] ide-cd: remove dead post_transform_command()
post_transform_command() call in cdrom_newpc_intr() has no effect because
it is done after the request has already been fully completed (rq->bio and
rq->data are always NULL).  It was verified to be true regardless whether
INQUIRY command is using DMA or PIO to transfer data (by using modified
Tejun Heo's test-shortsg.c utility and adding a few printk()-s to ide-cd).
This was uncovered thanks to the "blk_end_request: full I/O completion
handler (take 3)" patch series from Kiyoshi Ueda.

Kiyoshi: please rebase your patch on top of this one (I'll send
it to Linus in the next IDE update), should make your patch a bit
simpler.
Tejun: you had really good timing with posting test-shortsg.c
(it saved me some time coding user-space SG_IO tester), thanks!
