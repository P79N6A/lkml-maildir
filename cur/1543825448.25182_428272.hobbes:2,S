Subject: [PATCH 2.6.17-rc5 0/7] Kernel memory leak detector 0.3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a new version (0.3) of the kernel memory leak detector. See
the Documentation/kmemleak.txt file for a more detailed
description. The patches are also available from
http://homepage.ntlworld.com/cmarinas/kmemleak/
 (to be uploaded
shortly).
What's new in this version:
- more clean-up
- initial kernel modules support. It scans the data sections in a
  module while ignoring the text areas
- minor optimisation to avoid radix-tree lookup when updating
  the pointer information
- DEBUG_FS selected automatically (until/if a different method of
  triggering the memory scanning is implemented)
To do:
- better testing
- support for pointer aliases in kernel modules (i.e. container_of
  usage in modules)
- test Ingo's suggestion on task stacks scanning
- NUMA support
