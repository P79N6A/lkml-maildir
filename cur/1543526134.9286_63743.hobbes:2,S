Hi,
I ran tcpdump to get  an ftp trace.  The problem is that for acks sent
out from the client to the server informing that packets have been
received, the time difference comes out to   be negative. i.e. times of
packet2 - packet1 is negative.
e.g.
13:44:32.334333       server  >   client1
13.44.33.343833       server  >   client1
13.44.31.890097        client1  >  server
as u can see, 13.44.31.89007 is far less than 13.44.33.343833.  Any idea why it would work this way.
Sincerely,
Aamir
