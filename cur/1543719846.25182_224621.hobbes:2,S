Again not guaranteed to be true - they can be (and often are) passed further.
Moreover, they are also stored untyped in structures.  Common pattern
is
	foo.callback = f;
	foo.argument = p;
	iterate_over_blah(blah, &foo);
Note that here f is the only thing that will see the value of p _and_ the
only thing that cares about type of p.  iterator itself doesn't care and
can be used for different types.
