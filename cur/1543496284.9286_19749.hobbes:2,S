It seems there is a bug in your buffer code.
if I start:
	#hdparm -t /dev/hda1
then the kernel printk's:
	"invalidate_buffers(): b_count 1!"
at the end of the hdparm.
(around 10 messages)
Is that a know bug, can you reproduce it?
If not, then I can supply more details.

Then you have NT: They prove that if you decide everywhere 'scale'
instead of 'effective', the result becomes bloated & not much faster.
