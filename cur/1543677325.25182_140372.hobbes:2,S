Just as a idea for API. How about ABS_AREA or REL_AREA instead of 
ABS_MISC. The idea is the pressure value returned should be about 
the same if one presses hard with one finger or softly with a whole 
hand. So to tell the difference between the two we can report the 
pressure and the area over which it acted. Say in virtual reality 
environment simulation poking a object hard with your finger would
have a very different effect than placing your hand lightly on the 
object even tho they might register about the same pressure.
