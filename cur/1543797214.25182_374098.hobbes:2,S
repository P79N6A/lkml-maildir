There's no such function.  You're referring to isolate_lru_page().
btw, lru_add_drain() appears to be identical to lru_drain_cache().

Why not just extend the irq protection into lru_cache_add[_active]() and
lru_add_drain()?
Answer: because
preserve-irq-status-in-release_pages-__pagevec_lru_add.patch sucks, and
extending it in this manner sucks more.
Being able to push everything up to process context as you're proposing
puts all the suckiness into this slowpath, so fine.

Normally it's poor form for a library function to assume it can use
GFP_KERNEL.  But in this case, the allocation has such a huge upper-bound
that there's no reasonable alternative, so OK.
kmalloc() can return NULL, y'know.
