	Hey folks, in 2.4.19-pre2, and any kernel I've tried
previously, when I attempt to mount an EFS filesystem off of my
IDE-SCSI controlled CD-ROM drive mount will segfault.  I have also had
reports of the same happening with actual SCSI hardware CD-ROMS. I'm
assuming that this is either an efs bug, or a SCSI/CDROM bug, because
mounting the same CD on the computer's straight IDE CD Drive works just
fine.
