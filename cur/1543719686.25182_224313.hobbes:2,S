That is only an interim solution that will be used until we have proper
sysfs support and are able to re-bind a specific driver to a specific
port. And it seems that only i8042 needs to be changed. As I said before
serial ports still accessible via /dev/ttySx, and other architectures that
provide access to SERIO_8042 type ports have much less diverse set of
peripherials... The changes can be made on as-needed basis.
So the cons of my proposal:
- Drivers need to be modified but changes are very limited.
Pros of my proposal:
- Completely non-intrusive as far as serio subsystem goes.
- The rawdev serio driver can still be used later when we have sysfs.

Using mv would be implementation trouble, i would rahter do:
echo "rawdev" > /sys/bus/serio/devices/serio0/driver
or something alont these lines. At least that's my grand plan ;)
