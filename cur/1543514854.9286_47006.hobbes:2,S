I think it would help a lot of people started talking about three different
addresses:
1. The Bus physical address, i.e. what is in the PCI configuration
registers.
2. The System physical address, i.e. what ioremap() uses and is found in the
struct pci_dev base_address[] array. It is the physical address used by the
CPU. On systems like SPARC, this address would then go through the IOMMU to
generate the correct bus physical address.
3. The System virtual address, i.e. what the programmer uses to reference
the address space. It goes through the normal kernel virtual address
translation.

Where in the heck did you find that?
I was under the impression that the readb/w/l and writeb/w/l were only for
spaces marked as I/O space in PCI. I thought that if it was in PCI memory
space you could directly reference the address after you used ioremap().
If this is true, you can't just directly access the virtual address, then
somebody should really add this information to the Documentation/pci.txt
file.

Actually, my understanding is that the base_address[] is assigned in the PCI
configuration. The configuration registers are programmed with the PCI
physical address, and the base_address[] is set to the system physical
address (which may be different.)
If people really want to get the device drivers all working correctly, you
should probably start by agreeing on AND DOCUMENTING exactly what 'correct'
is. Without such information available, people are going to keep on having
problems writing device drivers.
