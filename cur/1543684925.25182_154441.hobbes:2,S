It was a side effect that it helped this particular issue. The idle detection 
was based around helping real world scenarios and it just happened to help.

Good call; I was quite aware this is the most effective way to create a fork 
bomb with my patch, but it's effect while being noticably worse than the 
original thud is still not disastrous. Yes I do appreciate variations on the 
theme can be made worse again; I'm doing some testing and experimenting there 
to see how best to tackle it.
