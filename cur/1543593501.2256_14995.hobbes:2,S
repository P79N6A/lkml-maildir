Given the slow speed of disks to use them efficiently when you are using
swap some additional rules apply.
In the worse case when swapping is being used you get:
Virtual Memory = RAM + (swap - RAM).
That cannot be improved.  You can increase your likely hood that that case won't
come up, but that is a different matter entirely.  
I suspect in practice that we are suffering more from lazy reclamation
of swap pages than from a more aggressive swap cache.
