It's not _all_ of USB, just:
166 char        ACM USB modems
                  0 = /dev/ttyACM0      First ACM modem
                  1 = /dev/ttyACM1      Second ACM modem
                    ...
167 char        ACM USB modems - alternate devices
                  0 = /dev/cuacm0       Callout device for ttyACM0
                  1 = /dev/cuacm1       Callout device for ttyACM1
                    ...
188 char        USB serial converters
                  0 = /dev/ttyUSB0      First USB serial converter
                  1 = /dev/ttyUSB1      Second USB serial converter
                    ...
189 char        USB serial converters - alternate devices
                  0 = /dev/cuusb0       Callout device for ttyUSB0
                  1 = /dev/cuusb1       Callout device for ttyUSB1
                    ...
216 char        USB BlueTooth devices
                  0 = /dev/ttyUB0               First USB BlueTooth device
                  1 = /dev/ttyUB1               Second USB BlueTooth device
                    ...
217 char        USB BlueTooth devices (alternate devices)
                  0 = /dev/cuub0                Callout device for ttyUB0
                  1 = /dev/cuub1                Callout device for ttyUB1
                    ...
I think you were confused with char major 180 which has
printers/mice/scanners/etc on it.
