Subject: Cardbus problem in pre2.3.40-(4->6)

Cardbus support in pre2.3.40-4 through 6 is no longer functional on my 
thinkpad. It seems as though the problem is with the changes to the 
yenta_irq_probe function in yenta.c.  If I compile 2.3.40-6 with these 
changes removed, I have no problems.  I have noticed others having 
similar problems.  This may be the cause.  At any rate, replacing the 
yenta.c with a previous (2.3.40-2 or earlier) version will work for now.
