Nice.
But it still leaves me confused.  Before I had this code:
	struct regs {
		uint32_t status;
		...
	}
	...
	struct regs *regs = ioremap(...);
	uint32_t status = regs->status;
	...
So now I should do it like this:
	#define REG_STATUS 0
	...
	void __iomem *regs = ioremap(...);
	uint32_t status = readl(regs + REG_STATUS);
	...
But wait, that only works when long is 32bit wide.  Plus I could be
stupid enough and "#define REG_STATUS 64" while the register space is
just 64 bytes long.  It solves the confusion about address spaces,
agreed, but overall I'm more confused now.  Hope it's just temporary.
