Hi,
5 days ago I pulled the git tree (HEAD was
25f666300625d894ebe04bac2b4b3aadb907c861), added two minor patches
(the vmsplice fix and the GFS1 exports), compiled and booted the
kernel.  Things are working OK, but I noticed that inode usage has
been steadily rising since then (see attached graph, unless lost in
transit).  The real filesystems used by the machine are XFS.  I wonder
if it may be some kind of bug and if yes, whether it has been fixed
already.  Feel free to ask for any missing information.
