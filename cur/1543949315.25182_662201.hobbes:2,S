This is a great feature for those of us who value their money more
than a few hours of time as well.  :-)
I would very much like to see this patch in mainline -- I've used it
to allow use of a marginally bad RAM stick in my home
workstation/fileserver, with great results (i.e. my FS never went
belly-up).
There have been times when I was reluctant to report bugs in a BadMEM
patched kernel, due to the patching, as well as times when I would
have liked to have stuck with my distro's kernel, but couldn't, 'cause
I needed to patch BadRAM in.
I haven't used BadRAM in a minute, nor read the patch.  ISTR that one
argument that has been historically made against this sort of thing is
that it would make bug reports unreliable.  But we have the taint
mechanism now, so that shouldn't be a showstopper -- if that's the
only argument, then set a new taint flag, please.
I've added a akpm to the CC list.
