Sorry. The following commit is the reason for this patch.
It removes CAPACITY_LEVEL from every other code, leaving the array with
sysfs attributes with one more entry than the number of enums in
power_supply.h. This leads to some attributes containing the value of
the attribute right after it. For example, temp_ambient would have the
value of time_to_empty_now. In my case, I had time_to_full_avg have the
value which should be in model_name, when the former was usually empty.

    power: remove POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CAPACITY_LEVEL
    The CAPACITY_LEVEL stuff defines various levels of charge; however, what
    is the difference between them?  What differentiates between HIGH and NORMAL
    LOW and CRITICAL, etc?
    As it appears that these are fairly arbitrary, we end up making such policy
    decisions in the kernel (or in hardware).  This is the sort of decision that
    should be made in userspace, not in the kernel.
    If the hardware does not support _CAPACITY and it cannot be easily calculate
    then perhaps the driver should register a custom CAPACITY_LEVEL attribute;
    however, userspace should not become accustomed to looking for such a thing,
    and we should certainly not encourage drivers to provide CAPACITY_LEVEL
    stubs.
    The following removes support for POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_CAPACITY_LEVEL.  The
    OLPC battery driver is the only driver making use of this, so it's
    removed from there as well.
