The argument is 'abuse', right?
Abuse is defined as using the LSM hooks for non-security applications,
right?
It seems to me that the community is doing a good job of discouraging
such abuse - by redirecting the "wrong-doers" to implement proper
upstream solutions, i.e. taskstats, the audit subsystem, etc.
Such encouragement seems a far better response than taking away freedoms
and flexibility from everyone.
