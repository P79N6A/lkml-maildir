Where can I get the queue?  I'd like to backport the patches (as merged by
you) to my various thinkpad-acpi backport trees, so that I can push the
thinkpad-acpi LED code to those trees for early testing...
I'd *really* recommend explicitly stating in the header file whether the
callbacks can or cannot be called from an interrupt context (i.e. "can they
sleep?").  And I sure hope it is "they can sleep", because otherwise, it
will be *hell* to implement them on any ACPI driver :-)
