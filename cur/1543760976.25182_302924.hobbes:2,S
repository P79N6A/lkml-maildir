Easy.
1) Unpack a vanilla kernel and build and install it as you usually do for a
system that doesn't need initramfs.
make menuconfig
make
make modules_install
cp arch/i386/boot/bzimage /boot/linux-2.6
2) Make a temporary directory (say, "initramfs") and put all files that you
want to go to your initramfs there. Don't forget the "/init" file, it is
used as a starting point for initramfs.
3) Make the initramfs image:
cd initramfs
find . | cpio -o -H newc | gzip -9 >/boot/initramfs-2.6.cpio.gz
4) Add /boot/linux-2.6 and /boot/initramfs-2.6.cpio.gz to your LILO or GRUB
as you would normally do with a kernel image and the initrd:
image=/boot/linux-2.6
        label="Linux"
        initrd=/boot/initramfs-2.6.cpio.gz
        root=/dev/hda1  # if your initramfs "/init" script understands this
        read-only       # if your initramfs "/init" script understands this
5) Upon reboot, the kernel will automatically determine that the image is
really an initramfs, not an initrd.
