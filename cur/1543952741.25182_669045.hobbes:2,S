Usually you already give the type implicitly in the commit:
dfd347f... HID: fix comment in hid_input_report()
fa331ff... [S390] sclp_vt220: speed up console output for interactive work
d9452e9... [NETPOLL]: Revert two bogus cleanups that broke netconsole.
8727e28... m68k{,nommu}: Wire up new timerfd syscalls
b863ceb... [NET]: Add macvlan driver
So all is well.
