It seems the only problem in my patches is that the file address space
operations have had the sync_pages op removed in a patch in the
disable-block-layer patchset as it's no longer necessary.
However, as I suspect you're applying the block patches *before* the FS-Cache
patches, I can't give you an incremental patch that you can apply after the
other fs-cache-make-kafs-* patches, since you need to modify the first patch
(fs-cache-make-kafs-use-fs-cache.patch) to get it to apply at all now.
So, I could issue a revised AFS+FS-Cache patch, would that do?  Or would you
rather have a patch that you can apply to the one you already have directly
and modify it in place?
