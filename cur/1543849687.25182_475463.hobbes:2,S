I don't use StGIT for collaborative development.  My StGIT branches
are really just patch queues (as the names for-2.6.19 and for-2.6.20
imply).  Usually development is just about done before things wind up
in a maintainer tree, so being able to apply updates to patches
already in my tree is more important than fully automated merged (as
native git gives you).
