However, can you guarantee that two threads won't enter startup() at
the same time?  (that's what ASYNC_INITIALIZED is protecting the
function against, and the corresponding shutdown() as well.)
It's probably better to port ESP to the serial_core structure where
this type of thing is already taken care of.
