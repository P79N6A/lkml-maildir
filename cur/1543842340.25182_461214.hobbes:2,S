Sounds simple enough.  Just two small worries though.
* It has an apparent side effect of setting PCI_COMMAND_INVALIDATE, 
which should be okay in sil3124's case.
* The controller might have some restrictions on configurable cache line 
size.  This is the same for MWI, so I guess this problem is just imaginary.
For the time being, I'll go with pci_set_mwi() but IMHO it would be 
better to have a pci helper for this purpose - 
pci_config_cacheline_size() or something.
Thanks.
