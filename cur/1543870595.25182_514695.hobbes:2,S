I don't think it's 2.6.x related, it's been under the sheets from start.
Related to your problem in the 7372 bug:
Pages are kept in memory for re-use, which is fast and fine except for:
1) data without re-use value or even single use
2) applications _do not_ advise the kernel how to cache pages related
   to there self generated i/o. POSIX does provide mechanisms to
   properly do so. But the kernel should help these poor apps.
To minimize your MySQL backup cp(1) problem, try this workaround:
cat ./cp_direct.sh 
#!/bin/sh
dd if=$1 of=$2 bs=1M iflag=direct oflag=direct
Combine this with [/etc/sysctl.conf]:
vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 1
vm.dirty_ratio = 2
vm.dirty_background_ratio = 1
This should reduce both the stress on the vm and response latency during
interactive work.
