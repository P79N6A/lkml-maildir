Fingers crossed, this is the final 3c59x patch for Linux 2.4.  But I
have heard very little from users of the Cardbus NICs.
Patch against 2.4.0-test3-pre2 is at
	
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/3c59x.patch
Changes since June 6:
- Added support for 3c556, updated pci.ids for this.
- More docco in Documentation/networking/vortex.txt
- The driver wasn't being a good citizen when sharing PCI interrupts.
  Potentially crashy as well.  Put an explicit test for this at the
  start of the ISR.
- Reset the transmitter when a txReclaim error occurs, as per the
  datasheet.
- The driver would crash the machine if ALL 32 dev_alloc_skb()'s
  failed at initialisation.  Now, we return -ENOMEM and fail the open()
  if we can't allocate all the skbs.
- The driver would stop receiving and would require ifdown/ifup if it
  completely ran out of Rx skbs during operation.  (This is caused by
  low memory).
  To fix this we now kick off a one-second timer which polls until
  the OOM condition recovers.
  Some other drivers solve this problem by hanging onto the last
  remaining skb.  That approach has lower OOM-recovery latency than the
  timer, but I prefer the timer because it has zero impact on the
  complexity of the normal-case code paths.  It worked out very nicely.
  Net driver developers: patches against 2.2 and 2.4 for testing this
  situation are at 
http://www.uow.edu.au/~andrewm/linux/#dev_alloc_fail
  Thanks to Mark Hemment for help with this one.
- The spinlocks around the mdio access functions were blocking
  interrupts for 300uSecs on a 400MHz machine.  So these were made more
  granular and were replaced with spin_lock_bh().
- Make the writes to TxFreeThreshold boomerang-only.  This register
  is reserved on other NICs.
- Added support for 802.3x MAC-layer flow control.  See
  Documentation/networking/vortex.txt.
  There is a testing tool which generates 802.3x PAUSE frames at

Things to do in 2.5:
- The Wake-on-LAN functions are still disabled.
- The driver does not support MTU changing.  This is needed by
  VLAN implementations.
- Utilise the 3c905C's DPD polling to reduce PCI accesses.
- Use MMIO.
