I believe the locks_verify_locked() call from mm/mmap.c prevents
mmap'ing shared-write a file with mandatory locks in force;
and the mapping_writably_mapped() calls from fs/locks.c prevent
mandatory locking on a file while it's mmap'ed shared-write.
Though I think there's no lock to prevent those checks racing,
so it's not quite watertight.
