Hi Folks.
I'm trying ( occasionally :) to try out the 2.6 series on my home setup.
Everything appears to work fine, except my ISDN card. It's a HiSax based
type 35, using the 2BDS0 driver. When the kernel tries to initialise it,
it complains bitterly, with many "PUT 0->1" and "PUT 1->0 " errors,
followed by link failures etc from ippd.
Is this supposed to work yet, as I asked a while back and it was still a
work in progress.
Any information gratefully received ( and I can supply more detailed
failure reports if required or helpful :)
Cheers,
Eamonn
