This too was fixed.  You could access the individual files in that
directory, but not list the directory :-/  Last I heard, Rik had his head
down cleaning up some other administrative things on the new box.
The relevant URL's are:
   
http://nl.linux.org/~phillips/htree/READ-ME
   
http://nl.linux.org/~phillips/htree/dx.pcache-2.4.4-7
   
ftp://ftp.math.psu.edu/pub/viro/ext2-dir-patch-S4.gz
Right now, the directory index patch is a patch on top of Al's patch,
sorry, we are in a state of transition. ;-)
