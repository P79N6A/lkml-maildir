I agree, except there are surprisingly many drivers like that.
You're right, we should be doing all of it in a different way, but this means
a lot of changes and we can't do them overnight.
As I wrote in the reply to Pavel, I think we can introduce .freeze(), .thaw()
(and .prethaw() for that matter) callbacks for hibernation and make drivers
use them, but that will be a long series of patches.  Still, I think it's
doable.
