Yeah. Somebody changed the prototype of dequeue_signal() and even though 
there are few users evidently didn't bother to fix them accordingly.
Current JFFS2 code depends on some fairly trivial rbtree updates which Linus
keeps ignoring without comment. Once those are in, I can update the JFFS2
code in 2.5 too, and will take a look if whoever broke it hasn't got around
to testing (or even compiling) their changes by then.
