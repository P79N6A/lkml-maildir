Dear programmers,
I don't subscribe to this mailing list, but I have a minor question
about kswapd of kernel-2.2.0-pre6/pre7. I found that the kill command
like
	kill -9 3
	killall5 -9
will cause the process kswapd to become zombie. But in kernel-2.0.X,
kswapd seems to ignore the SIGKILL signal. It might cause some problems,
since sometimes we would like to switch to single user mode to maintain
system, but /etc/init.d/ scripts will use killall5 to send the SIGKILL
message before going to the single user mode, and the kswapd dies.
Now we quick hack the source of killall5 such that it doesn't send the
SIGKILL signal to process 3 (kswapd). But I don't think this is a good
idea. Is there any other suggestions?
