OK, but waking up kswapd doesn't indicate a low memory condition.
It's standard procedure .... we'll have to wake it up whenever we dip
below the high watermarks. Perhaps before dropping into direct reclaim
would be more appropriate?

Sounds fair.

Mmmm. how much are you talking about in terms of throughput, and on what
platforms? all previous attempts to measure page colouring seemed to 
indicate it did nothing at all - maybe some specific types of h/w are
more susceptible?
