Subject: [BK PATCH] USB changes for 2.5.67
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are some USB changes.  Most notable here is a usbnet driver update
that should remove the need for the separate cdc-ether.c driver, a
DocBook documentation update for the usbfs interface, and a usb-storage
update that fixes some bugs noted in the bug database.  There are some
other good bugfixes in here too.
I've also included my patches in here that add hotplug support for the
kobject core, and convert the driver core to use this functionality.
These patches were posted to lkml in the past, and Pat has said they
look good to him.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/linus-2.5
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
