That would be 2.

	Think for a minute - we allocate a refcounted object.  That means
getting (the only) reference to it.  That means refcount equal to 1.  It's
a fairly common idiom - not just pages are handled that way.
	What happens is:
* We created a page.  We have a reference to it.
* We put it into cache.  Now there are two ways to reach it - our reference
and global search structure.
* We do ->readpage() - we know that we have a reference, so it's not going
away
* We drop our reference.  That does not affect the presence in cache - it's
not our responsibility anymore.  We are done with this page; if somebody
decides to kick it out of cache, it will be their resposibility to drop the
reference created when putting into cache.
