and a hidden memory allocation.
Which GFP flag would you use for the allocation?
(And how would you actually _pass_ it)
GFP_KERNEL? Good luck, if you see a
a = b + c;
in atomic context.
GFP_ATOMIC? Well, we both don't want that.
Checking is_atomic() and deciding upon that?
I call that overhead... .
