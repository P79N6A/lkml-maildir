Subject: [PATCH 0/11] make link target handling more robust
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

These patches fix potential bugs associated with link target handling,
primarily by NULL-terminating names read from disk.
The ext2 and generic page_getlink changes have been tested by listing
corrupted links and creating and listing valid ones. Other patches have
been compile-tested only.
Cheers,
Duane.
