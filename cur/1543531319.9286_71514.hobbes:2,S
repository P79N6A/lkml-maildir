I missed the beginning of this thread.  I have the same board you
have.  I upgraded the BIOS to 1012 (maybe 1011 - I forget
exactly).  Any time I enable the full set  of options (AUTODMA,
PIIX tuning, etc, ie: what Andre says should be used), I eventually
get DMA timeouts.  If I'm careful, ie: booted into single user
mode, root mounted r/o, DMA is turned off automatically when the
failure occurs and the system recovers.  If I'm running say, X,
when the DMA failure occurs, sometimes the system can hang.  I
don't know exactly the result since I don't try testing DMA on a
r/w drive any more.  If I use something like dd if=/dev/hda
of=/dev/null, I'll get DMA timeouts within a couple of seconds.
Kernels: lots: 2.2.15pre14, 2.3.99pre2, to name a few.
Drives: Seagate.  I can't get to my home system right now, so I
can't be more specific.
Does this match your experiences?
