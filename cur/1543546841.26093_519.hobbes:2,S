What is "broken" about Pthreads is the clumsy interaction between UNIX
semantics and threads and it seems to me that this is all due to overdesign
and some false assumptions in the threaded programming model that was
current 15 years ago. While we do have the benefit of hindsight, the
same overdesign continues in POSIX drafts. To note a pet-peeve of mine,
the POSIX specification of priority-inheritance embeds a stupid mechanism
in what should be a policy specification.

I think that POSIX threads is a great specification struggling to dig
its way out of the garbage piled on top of it.
To take one example, why not simply define signals
by: UNIX signals are per-process, thread signals are per-thread? E.g.  an
implementation will act as if the original exec'd program is the process
and does all signal handling. This process may use pthread_kill
to pass signals on to threads, but there is no interaction between
process masks and thread masks and no interaction between process and
thread signals.

One of the reasons I like Linux is that nobody has too much reverence
for past design decisions. In fact, a famous Australian Linux developer
recently described his own code as "20,000 lines of untested crap", but I
think that was rather unkind as there are somewhat less than 20,000 lines.
