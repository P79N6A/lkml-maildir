 AFAIR, HGC has 32 kB of primary RAM the screen window may be located
within -- much like CGA, only mapped to ISA at different addresses.  It
has also 32 kB of secondary RAM decoding of which has to be enabled
explicitly and which is used in HGC's graphics mode, usually. 
 In fact, almost all standard IBM PC video adapters have the ability to hw
scroll in the text mode.  The only exception is the original MDA.  I do
not know of any implementation bugs but all cards I tested were able to hw
scroll. 
 Linux does not make use of hw scrolling on HGC, though, and I am not
sure, why.
