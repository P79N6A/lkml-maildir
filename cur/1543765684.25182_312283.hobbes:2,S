Takashi-san's description was not very clear, but it sounds like it's a
patching mechanism for userspace applications - not for kernel space.
So kprobes would not be a good fit.
If I'm right, I'm not sure why some of the bits of it were done
separately instead of via the existing ptrace mechanism.  And GDB
would appreciate a mechanism for mmap/munmap/mprotect in a debugged
process, also.
