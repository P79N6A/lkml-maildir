This is a problem that is bigger than simplely issueing a simple
setfeatures non-data-pio command.  All of the PIO data-phases are broken.
Nothing works but DMA, and there is no reason it should fail.
Something has gone totally wrong between the 2.5.1 patch submitted to it
being applied for the creation of 2.5.3-pre1.
If the driver falls out of DMA, DEADBOX!!!!
There is a conflict of BIO and ACB and it is very fatal.
Therefore I will have to withdraw the patch and resubmit with the legacy
data-path added back so the kernel development can continue.
The only kernel in the development series known to work is 2.5.1.
However it appears that several people can not successfully use this
CodeBase either.
Until I can submit a new patch witch is a replacement, do not attempt
2.5.3-pre1 at all.
