How do you "copy those files" when you don't have extent support at that
point?  Remember - the whole problem here is that if you don't have
extent support, you can't read the file, it's backward-incompatible.
(If you *are* able to read the file even without extents, then this whole
thread is total BS).
You can certainly at least try to copy them to another file system
while the source *is* mounted with -o extents, and then mount without it
and copy the files back, but (a) that isn't what you said and (b) it doesn't
work for files over 2T or so..
