There are a lot of reasons why we would wake kswapd apart from starting
swapout.  Such as to reclaim clean pagecache or some dcache+icache.

Way too specialised, I suspect.  Is it not possible to have a little
userspace daemon which monitors the long-running applications's rss and
whacks it if the rss gets too large?
The patch you have simply kills the process when all the eligible zones
reach their upper watermark.  Again, we can probably determine that state
from userspace right now.  If not, it would be simple enough to add the
required info to /proc somewhere.
