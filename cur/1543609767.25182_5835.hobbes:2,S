I'm replying to my own post because I've received serveral off list
replies.  None of them quite correct.  It seems there are two files that
need to be patched.
I'm attaching the patch that finally allowed my kernel to compile.  It is
mostly the one that Horst von Brand sent me (which he said Linus
prescribed), but with a correction to the first hunk.
