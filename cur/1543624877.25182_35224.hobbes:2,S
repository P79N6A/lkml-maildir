It matters to a software engineering wonk like me :)   I know it 
-really- doesn't matter, but from a theoretical perspective, if we are 
trying to achieve the "everything is hotpluggable" model, poweroff via 
device tree will naturally fall out from that.
If it makes it easier for some, I consider poweroff not as an act unto 
itself, but as a transition to state D3cold. :)  And since we will 
eventually be able to handle transition to similar low-power states, we 
might as well follow similar/the same code paths.
