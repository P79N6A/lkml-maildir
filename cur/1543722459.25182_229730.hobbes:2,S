sure but it helps to find out if it is a limitation of the raid controller,
the disk, pci or linux. first do a cache read, then a raid0 read and then
start to wonder about redundancy.

This clearly shows you, that the raid controller or disk is the problem.
(However of course this can also mean the driver is not using the best

Perhaps using 2 x PercDC is better here.
