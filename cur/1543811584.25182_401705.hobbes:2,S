That is why you have magic delimiters, like the colons and newlines in
/etc/passwd.  You also specify the delimiters in your inheritance
syntax.  You don't want it to really all be one file, because you want
separation of modification times and acls that let users change their
own gecos field and etc., but there are times when you want to act on
/etc/passwd as one file.
