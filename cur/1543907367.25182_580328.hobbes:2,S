I quickly went through the problem description and the
patch. I think currently problem is not fully understood
and we are trying to put a patch. I think we need to
do little more study of the problem and then think of
a solution.

Point 1 and Point 2 seems to be same.

I doubut that it would be the issue. Looking at intel IOAPIC (82093AA)
documentation, it says that IRR bit of IOAPIC will be set only if
destination CPU has accepted the interrupt. So if we have disabled
the LAPIC, it will not accept the interrupt and IRR bit of IOAPIC
should not be set.

We do issue EOI for all the pending interrupts in second
kernel. Look at setup_local_APIC(). Once the second is booting, it
checks if there are any pending interrupts (ISR bit is set). If yes,
it goes ahead and issues an extra EOI. This should also clear the
IRR register of IOAPIC.

disable_IO_APIC() code does not clear the vector information
in routing table. It just masks the interrupt. So even if
an EOI is issued later in second kernel, it should clear the
IRR bit at IOAPIC.

I doubt this. There are situations when there is no device
driver for the device and device pushes the interrupt (frequently
observed in the case of kdump). Kernel still keeps on receiving
the interrupt without driver telling device to lower the interrupt
line.

I can imagine one possibility. There might be pending interrupts
on a non-crashing cpu. When second kernel boots, we initialize only
one cpu and issue EOI for pending interrupts only on that CPU. So
if an interrupt is pending on other CPU, then IRR bit for that interrupt
on IOAPIC will remain set and one would not get further interrupts from
that device.
- Can you please see if you can reproduce same problem with a
  single processor (maxcpus=1)
- Can you please print local apic (print_local_APIC) and
  ioapic registers (print_IO_APIC) and verify above theory?
Thanks
