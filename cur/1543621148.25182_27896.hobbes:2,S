Feel free to join a standards committee. In the mean time, I agree we have
a duty to fix it, since the current implementation can hang forever
without improving the securty of the data one bit, therefore sync(2)
should return after all data generated before the sync has been written
and not wait for all data written by all processes in the system to
complete.
BTW: I think users would expect the system call to work as the standard
specifies, not some better way which would break on non-Linux systems. Of
course now working programs which conform to the standard DO break on
Linux.

We agree on that, and it doesn't violate the standard. What we do now
doesn't.

It doesn't matter, if you write the existing dirty buffers the filesystem
type is irrelevant. And if you have cache in your controller and/or drives
the data might be there and not on the disk. If you have those IBM drives
discussed a few months ago and a bad sector, the drive may drop the data.
The point I'm making is that doing it really right is harder than it
seems.
Also, there are applications which don't like journals because they create
and delete lots of little files, or update the file information
frequently, resulting in a write to the journal. Sendmail, web servers,
and usenet news do this in many cases. That's why the noatime option was
added.

The problem is that the system call should work in a way which doesn't
violate the standard. I think waiting for all existing dirty buffers is
conforming, waiting until hell freezes over isn't, nor does it have any
benefit to the user, since the sync is either an end of the execution
safety net or a checkpoint. In either case the user doesn't expect to have
the program hang after *his/her* data is safe.

I have an idea, I'll put it in another message, since only two of us are
likely to be reading at this point.
