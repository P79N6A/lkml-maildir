 To be conservative, I do it in every vcpu run, and have any kind of
cpu frequency scaling disabled. And it does not work.
In a trace in the host, I see that vcpu runs happens very often in
vcpu 0 (probably because exits happen often there, so we have to go
back),
and comparatively, very few times in vcpu 1.
So what's probably happening is : vcpu 1 does system_time + tsc_delta,
 but vcpu 0 has already updated it so many times, the tsc does not
keep up,
and it end going backwards.
I'm running (in the host), the following test, upon module loading
(and Ingo can please tell me if I'm doing something idiotic in it,
compromising my conclusions)
void test (int foo)
{
       u64 start, stop;
       start = native_read_tsc();
       udelay(foo);
       stop = native_read_tsc();
       printk("%d Result: %lld\n", foo, foo * 1000 - cycles_2_ns(stop
- start));
}
Output is:
30 Result: -126
90 Result: 576
300 Result: 2627
1000 Result: 9381
3000 Result: 28238
5000 Result: 48086
So the delta is expecting to get bigger. If a vcpu passes a long time
without having the time updated.
Xen manages to keep the guest tsc stable and steady by doing
synchronization from time to time.
We can either: (If I'm right at this, of course):
* put a periodic timer in the host to update the system time from time to time;
* use some sort of global timestamp, instead of the per-cpu one.
* do something akin to what xen does, and still rely on the tsc.
Any thoughts?
