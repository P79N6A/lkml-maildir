So under the OLD behaviour, your app collapses in a heap (excuse pun).

This is precisely what the NEW behaviour does - kill the newly started
memory hog. Your simulation then gets the 5 bytes it asked for, albeit
after a slight delay.

The swap may not even exist previously - it could be a shared "emergency"
swap space over NFS, or it could be free space on a local disk. You
wouldn't want to use this as swap normally, but can temporarily bring it
online.

Just one, then a second if the problem remains.

You may well have perfectly valid reasons for not using it initially. It
could, for example, be a shared scratch area on a server. If all the
machines had (idle) swap files on that partition, it would waste all the
space - and the one machine needing it would get very little.
Equally, you don't want all your free disk space committed to a swap file
on the offchance it might come in handy!

As well as *destroying* performance (you'd effectively eliminate COW
capability on fork - if your 500Mb simulation wants to fork a 100k mailer
process to send you an update, the kernel has to allocate and copy 500Mb
of RAM/swap first, then discard it all again.)

I agree. No doubt the selection algorithm for the "hit list" could be
fine-tuned, but it's a very big improvement as it stands.
