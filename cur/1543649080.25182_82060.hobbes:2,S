oh... nice to learn about your plans (so late) at all ;-)
well, it would be cool if you'd cooperate (or at least share
information) with us (the official cryptoapi project ;-), as we're open
for the design requirements of the next generation cryptoapi...
...otherwise this may render the kerneli.org/cryptoapi effort completely
useless :-/ ...of course, if it's your long term goal to take the
cryptoapi development away from kerneli.org, I'd like to know too ;-)
