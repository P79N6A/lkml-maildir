Hi,
some nitpicks about the ioctl interfaces while it still can be done ;)

as a general rule, it's a lot better to sort structures big-to-small, to
make sure alignments inside the struct are minimized and don't suck too
much. This is especially important to get right for 32/64 bit
compatibility. This comment is true for most structures in this header
file; please consider this at least

it's probably nicer to use explicit enum values for the interface, just
as documentation if nothing else
