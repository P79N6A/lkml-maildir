It is very difficult for it to not be a fixed size. If you kept queues
per device you could probably allocate them when the device is loaded at
best.
The reason for this is that you cannot do a memory allocation during a
block I/O - since the block I/O itself may need to complete in order
to free any memory. That means request queue entries cannot be dynamically
allocated as they are needed.

The SCSI layer tries to be too clever. Much too clever. It is true some of
that is to get around the block layer being less than perfect for its need,
but most of it is because the scsi layer is optimised for 6 year old
technology, and it shows, It is a superb interface for dumb PIO scsi
controllers.
Fundamentally the scsi devices should be talking directly to the block
layer.  That is the biggest problem with the scsi mid layer - you have
to go through it, you can't just call bits of it as needed by your
driver.
It really should be
	block 
          |
    dumbscsiadapter
          |
     scsi_queue
          |
      dumb_docmd
so that a smart controller can skip some of the scsi midlayer features
that are useless to it
