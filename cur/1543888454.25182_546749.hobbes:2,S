Well, whether it is readable / maintainable is subjective and hence
debatable. I was only answering your *completely misplaced and
incorrect* original comment against the patch where you claimed
that the patch was "totally wrong" because of the way it removed
the "select" ... etc ...
And remember, like I said already, the whole _idea_ is such arch-
specific helper code be not mentioned from arch-agnostic Kconfig
files. You may not like it, but this is the standard / most common way
such cases are handled for tons of other cases in arch/.... Which
is why Adrian's way of solving this (shifting all such arch-specific
helper symbols also to drivers/... and then using depends on select
on it) is not viable.
