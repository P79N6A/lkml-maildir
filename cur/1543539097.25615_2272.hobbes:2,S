Hello,
I've put an updated version of user beancounter patch intended to provide
advanced resource control and protection against local denial-of-service
attacks.
This patch introduces the initial version of memory consumption control in
term of guarantees.  The list of differences from the previous version is:
 - accounting for unswappable memory used by socket buffers;
 - resident size guarantees;
 - limits for IPC and anonymous shared memory,
   small mainstream kernel bug in mm/mmap.c (MAP_SHARED case) is fixed;
 - allocation guarantees (mmap/brk success);
 - guarantees against kills because of out-of-memory.
