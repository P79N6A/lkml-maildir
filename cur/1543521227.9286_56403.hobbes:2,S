Yes. For lm_sensors, 'directories' within /proc/sys/dev/sensors are
created automatically whenever a new sensors device is found. The
only way right now to find the sysctl numbers of these directories
is to read another file (/proc/sys/dev/sensors/devices), which lists
them. It works well, but it is not very beautiful. 
I suspect there will be more drivers in the future which will have
these problems. Some way of getting a list of the sysctl 'files'
present within a sysctl 'directory' is essential.
(for those wondering: lm_sensors is a collection of drivers for
 mainboard SMBus adapters and hardware sensors devices. You can
 find more information at 
http://www.lm-sensors.nu/.
 Due to
 the current kernel feature freeze, we will not submit it until
 the 2.5 tree has started. Meanwhile, they work great for 2.2 or
 2.3 kernels).
