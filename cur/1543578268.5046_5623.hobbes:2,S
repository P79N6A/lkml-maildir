Great! I've been waiting for something like this. In particular the
knfsd TCP server code can get very buffer-intensive without it since
you need to pre-allocate 1 set of buffers per TCP connection (else you
get DOS due to buffer saturation when doing wait+retry for blocked
sockets).
If it all gets in to the kernel, I'll do the work of adapting the NFS
+ sunrpc stuff.
Cheers,
