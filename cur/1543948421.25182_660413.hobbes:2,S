Not if you want video to come back on most hardware - the kernel has no 
idea how to reinitialise your graphics card. s2ram and similar tools 
attempt to deal with this by reprogramming it from userspace. On the 
other hand, if it did work on the same hardware with earlier kernels, 
then that's a bug.
