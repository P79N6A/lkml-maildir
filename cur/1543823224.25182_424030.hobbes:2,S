I can also recommend firescope + firewire cards. It's not early
yet, but I hope eventually. But it can work without the target still
being alive and also does on most laptops.

In my experience the biggest problem in the field is that most 
of it scrolls away. That is why I tweaked the x86-64 format to be as space
efficient as possible. That's also why the "executive summary" was added.
But Ingo has a point that it usually doesn't help anyways because backtraces
tend to be so overlong now after the code got through 20 callbacks before
it can do something actually useful.

I use vga=0x0f07
It's a butt ugly font, but it's the smallest I could find without using
the slow fbcon.
If you can't remember the hex number use vga=ask
