Subject: [PATCH 0/3] make threads traversal ->siglock safe
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/22/315

With this patch series we don't need tasklist_lock to iterate over thread
group anymore. The actual change (PATCH 3/3) is a one-liner, patches 1-2
are needed to make an illusion of hard and nontrivial work.
Oleg.
