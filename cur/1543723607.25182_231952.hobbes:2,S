You think it should be in user-space?  I don't think talking to the
BIOS should ever be in user-space.

Didn't the old 2.4 behaviour include BIOS queries?
In any case, I don't have any evidence that anything is wrong.  On my
computer, I can tell the BIOS to use CHS geometry, (as opposed to
"Auto", "LBA" or "Large") modify the partition table to set the CHS
start/end of the Windows partition to 0, 1024, or anything I like, and
Windows STILL works.  I can't get anything to break!
So, can anyone break Windows?
Cheers,
Andrew
