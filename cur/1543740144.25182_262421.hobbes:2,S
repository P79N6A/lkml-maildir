I was imagining not in this case, where the i_data follows immediately
after the struct address_space *i_mapping.  But let's not rely on that.

I would care: not so much the penalty, as the danger of surprise.
Would __attribute__((aligned((sizeof(long))))) seem better to you?
Do you think it would be better on the declaration of struct
address_space itself, than on the struct address_space i_data?
Thanks for the feedback,
