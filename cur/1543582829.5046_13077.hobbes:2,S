Well, here's the whole situtation...
Compiled 2.4.2 and reboot forcing fsck. No errors.
Tried mounting a cd image via loopback to see if loopback was working
again. Mount hangs. Reboot command stalled waiting for filesystems to
unmount. Force with alt-sysreq-<s,u,b>. Booted w/o any errors. Restart
forcing fsck and this time fsck needs to clear some inodes.
Once I am rebooted again, I went to reinstall some rpms for files I saw
fsck complain about and I get these errors.
