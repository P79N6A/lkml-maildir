Hold over from old procfs use of pci resources.  And now a requirement
that X uses this, after it was pointed out to me.

I never have liked that, it belongs somewhere else.  Please move it.

That is merely a dev_t, a single value.
Come on, there are way worse violators[1] of the "one value per file"
rule in sysfs that you could have found if you wanted to try to declare
how much it is not being followed in places.  But if you look, the ratio
of good vs. bad usage is still very high, and keeping it high is my
goal.

Feedback from whom?  I know I sure liked the fact that you did your own
filesystem, despite the bugs that were found in it at times :)
