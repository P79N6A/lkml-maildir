modutils-2.3.4.tar.gz	- Replace /etc/conf.modules with /etc/modules.conf.
patch-modutils-2.3.4.gz	- Patch from 2.3.3 to 2.3.4.
Although this replaces conf.modules with modules.conf, 2.3.4 will fall
back to reading conf.modules if modules.conf does not exist, as for
modutils 2.1.  This version will warn if you have a depreciated name.
Eventually it will give an error but that will not occur until kernel
2.5 is released, users have plenty of time to change their filenames.
