If you have access to an oscilliscope or better yet a digital oscilliscope,
you can try probing the SMIACT# signal when the system is running normally.
You should see this signal high all of the time. If it ever pulses low,
then you're getting SMIs.
If you have access to a DMM (Digital Multi Meter), then the next time it
locks, try probing the SMIACT# pin. It's not that hard to do and a DMM can
be had for less than $50 bucks. If want to try this and you need any help,
e-mail me privately and I can help you set it up.
Thanks,
