FWIW, lkcd (crash dump) treats hugetlb pages as normal kernel pages and
dumps them, which is pointless and wastes a lot of time.  To avoid
dumping these pages in lkcd, I had to add a PG_hugetlb flag.  lkcd runs
at the page level, not mm or vma, so VM_hugetlb was not available.  In
set_hugetlb_mem_size()
	for (j = 0; j < (HPAGE_SIZE / PAGE_SIZE); j++) {
		SetPageReserved(map);
		SetPageHugetlb(map);
		map++;
	}
In dump_base.c, I changed kernel_page(), referenced_page() and
unreferenced_page() to test for PageHugetlb() before PageReserved().
Since you are looking at identifying hugetlb pages, could any other
code benefit from a PG_hugetlb flag?
