However, it helps if you have a grasp of technologies like ACPI,
IO-APICs, APICs, PCI IRQ routing for x86 problems.  Since I don't
work in the x86 field, I have _zero_ knowledge of such things
because they just don't apply when working on ARM.
That makes debugging x86 problems a nightmare.  Remember I gave
up with trying to sort out peoples PCMCIA problems?
