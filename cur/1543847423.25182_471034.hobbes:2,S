This is why I want this to go into -mm .. To flush out the corner cases
that it's impossible for me to find on my own.

I think you know what your talking about, and I respect your opinion.. I
think you have some points, that I will follow up on. However most of
what your saying comes off to me like, "Reverse _all_ your changes!" ,
"Makes this patch set go away for 2 months", and I don't understand
where that is coming from.
