Yes, I was worried about disabling preemption for an unbounded amount of
time.

I had not even considered that. To be honest, I had not even heard of it
till now. So I spent another morning at LWN grokking preemptible RCU;)
I think it can work. I'm a little worried about the OOM risk. It could take
a really long time to iterate over the task list. A lot of pending kfree()s
could build up in that time.
I'm still unclear as to whether khungtaskd would get priority boosted
or not. Are only tasks that explicitly block (by sleeping on a lock)
boostable or would a task which got pre-empted inside the critical section
also be boostable? My worry here is khungtaskd would run at high priority for
an indefinite amount of time making it more overhead. Is there an OOMing-soon
booster?
But I think this can all be mitigated by adding back the max_count sysctl.
But preemptible RCU would allow increasing the default to a much higher
value or we may even be able to make the default "check all tasks".
Running out of time today but I'll send out a patch tomorrow.
Thanks Peter!

Mandeep
