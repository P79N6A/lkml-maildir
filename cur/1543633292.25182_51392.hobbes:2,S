Hi,
My kernel ooops at boot time when using pci=biosirq.
Loading modules: 3c59x Unable to handle kernel paging request at
virtual address 00009a28
 printing eip:
c00f7241
*pde = 00000000
Oops: 0000
[...]
Process modprobe (pid: 34, stackpage=c1ddb000)
I tried pci=biosirq because I had a :
kernel: PCI: No IRQ known for interrupt pin A of device 00:09.0. Please try
using pci=biosirq.
When trying to get a Ricoh RL5c475 CardBus bridge working.
Is this a known bug ? What is the workaround ?
I'm not a kernel guru, so I don't exactly know how to give you useful
infos.
If you want the full ooops output, just let me know, i'd copy it by
hand.
Cheers,
