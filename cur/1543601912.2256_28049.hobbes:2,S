BTW ...
When I switched to Duron with a new (well, it was my friend's) motherboard
(according to lspci: 00:00.0 Host bridge: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8363/8365 [KT133/KM133] (rev 02)),
I can't boot Linux anymore since it stucked around partiotion checking (sorry
I don't remember, but I can check on the next week). It was kernel 2.2.19.
2.4.x works without any problem, the last kernel I've checked (and using now)
is 2.4.9. Is it the same problem?
