Please CC this back, as I'm not yet on the kernel-mailing-list
I'm currently running the following:
kernel 2.4.3
gcc 2.95.3
modutils 2.4.2
dhcpcd v.1.3.19-pl8
The problem is, after compiling the 2.4.4 kernel with the exact
configuration as I had used on the 2.4.3 kernel, my system hangs at:
8139too Fast Ethernet driver 0.9.16 loaded [the version number is
greater than 0.9.15c (which is used in 2.4.3) though I'm not exactly
sure if it's 0.9.16]
PCI: Found IRQ 9 for device 00:0b.0
eth0: RealTek RTL8139 Fast Ethernet at 0xd0814000, 00:50:ba:d2:45:21,
IRQ 9
eth0:  Identified 8139 chip type 'RTL-8139B'
eth0: Setting half-duplex based on auto-negotiated partner ability 0000.
[this is where it hangs, it requires me to reboot and load up a backup
kernel (2.4.3)]
If there is any other information you require to solve this problem, I'd
be happy to help.
