Well here is the rub.  Your high side give an error of 686 PPM while the low 
side has an error of only 152 PPM.  This assumes, of course, that you are trying 
to hit exactly 1,000,000 nano seconds per tick.
On the other hand, since we do correct for this error, I suspect one could use 
the high side number.
Still, if an application depends on the count rather than just reading the 
clock, I suspect that some would consider it broken.  Timer signals can be 
delayed and may, in fact overrun with out notice (unlike POSIX timers which tell 
you when they overrun).
What you really need is a higher resolution timer.  Funny, there seems to be a 
reference to such a thing in my signature :)
