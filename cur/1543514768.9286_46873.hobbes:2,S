This is what I'm actually doing.

Ok, it *is* a sanity check. But it finds all those common problems like
"memory hole accidently turned on", "memory is slightly smaller than
the expected xxxxMB" or "a (too big) stale mem= sneaked in".

Certainly. After all it's a sanity check and not an automatic memory
detection or memory test.
