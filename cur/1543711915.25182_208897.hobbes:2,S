Sorry, I should have been more explicit. I had 0 time (writing before
going to work, like now). So, what I really wanted to ask is the
following:
1) does gcc (compile) always cause an MCE?
2) If yes, can you try to narrow it down by
	a) running separately different gcc stages on a trivial C-program,
	like the one above (preprocessor with gcc -E, produce assembly
	output with gcc -S, compile without linking with gcc -c, link with
	ld)
	b) once you've figured out which stage causes it, try to further
	narrow it down by running this stage under gdb. Since you
	re-compiled gcc yourself, you should have the sources at hand, and
	should be able set up a couple of break-points to narrow it down
	gradually, eventually coming to a single assembly instruction - if
	my suspicion is right.

I know. You can compile with the Java compiler, but not with gcc. Can you
explain, why? I cannot.
Thanks
