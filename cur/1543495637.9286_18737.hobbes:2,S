Hello,
The only problem with your patch that I see is:
a) the information is already available in /proc/stat
b) with your patch now it is more complex to discover which irqs are
registered at the moment.
So, a) means it does not add anything new and b) means it removes
something which is already there (the ease of detecting what is currently
active).
Many regards,
