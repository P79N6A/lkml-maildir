Really?  I'm looking at -rc3 now as -rc1 is rather old and it's definitly
not the case there.  I also can't remember ever doing this - when I
started the generic read/write path untangling I had exactly the same
situation that's now in -rc3:
  - generic_file_aio_write_nolock calls sync_page_range_nolock
  - generic_file_aio_write calls sync_page_range
  - __generic_file_aio_write_nolock doesn't call any sync_page_range variant
