Uh ? I want some of those disks....
How are you measuring that ?
Some more real numbers.
A SATA raid5:
nada:~# lsscsi
[1:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      Maxtor 7Y250M0   YAR5  -       
[2:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      Maxtor 7Y250M0   YAR5  -       
[3:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      Maxtor 7Y250M0   YAR5  -       
[4:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      Maxtor 7Y250M0   YAR5  -       
[5:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      Maxtor 7Y250M0   YAR5  -       
[6:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      Maxtor 7Y250M0   YAR5  -       
[7:0:0:0]    disk    ATA      Maxtor 7Y250M0   YAR5  -
nada:~# hdparm -t /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
/dev/sdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  156 MB in  3.02 seconds =  51.70 MB/sec
/dev/sdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  154 MB in  3.02 seconds =  50.96 MB/sec
nada:~# hdparm -t /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  148 MB in  3.01 seconds =  49.20 MB/sec
An SCSI raid0 one (160 and 320 mixed...)
annwn:~# hdparm -t /dev/sdc /dev/sdb
/dev/sdc:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  226 MB in  3.02 seconds =  74.72 MB/sec
/dev/sdb:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  122 MB in  3.00 seconds =  40.64 MB/sec
annwn:~# hdparm -t /dev/md0
/dev/md0:
 Timing buffered disk reads:  242 MB in  3.00 seconds =  80.62 MB/sec
