Hi all
Perhaps I'm doing something wrong, but it seems to me the 2.2.0pre6 kernel
is leaking inodes like crazy..
I keep increasing the number in /proc/sys/fs/inode-max (and file-max as
well to keep the ratio the same as suggested in the documentation) but
everytime I do, within hours it reaches that limit again..
I'm now up to 65536 for inode-max and inode-nr is at:
live:/proc/sys/fs# cat inode-nr 
93390   7009
while file-nr is currently at only:
live:/proc/sys/fs# cat file-nr 
1225    244     24676
Is there anything I can do to find out where these inodes are going?
btw if it helps, inode-state says:
live:/proc/sys/fs# cat inode-state 
93390   7012    1       0       0       0       0
I'm not doing anything different on this machine that could cause it to go
through so many inodes all of a sudden - I haven't seen this problem
before. (last kernel tried was 2.1.132)
If you need any more info, please just ask. :)
