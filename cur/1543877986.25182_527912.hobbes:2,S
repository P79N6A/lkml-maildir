Subject: [PATCH RFC] x86: clear X86_FEATURE_MWAIT for AMD Fam10 CPU
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/5/341

Hi,
I send this as RFC because I won't manage it to test it
before end of Easter but want to have a consensus about
how the final patch should look like.
Andi,
what do you finally prefer?
(1) Something like the attached patch or
(2) a version which keeps to the MWAIT flag for Fam10 but
    introduces an X86_FEATURE_MWAIT_DOESNT_SAVE_POWER as you
    suggested.
An idle=mwait kernel parameter could (and should) be introduced
with both alternatives.
Meanwhile I think it would suffice to do (1) and issue another
cpuid if idle=mwait was used to select mwait_idle.
Regards,
Andreas
