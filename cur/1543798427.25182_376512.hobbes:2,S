Reading through the specs I have here, block sizes seem to be all over
the place.  The MMC card specs seem to imply that any block size can
be set, from 0 bytes to 2^32-1 bytes.
The PXA MMC interface specification allows the block size to be anything
from 1 to 1023 bytes, excluding CRC.  It is unclear whether a value of 0
means 1024.
The MMCI specification allows the block size to be specified as a power
of two, from 1 to 2048 bytes, excluding CRC.
Pierre - can you comment on wbsd's capabilities please?
