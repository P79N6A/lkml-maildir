vzx = VirtualiZation Xen
vzx = Vmware virtualiZation linuX
vzx = VirtualiZation eXternal
So 'vzx' can represent Xen, VMware, or any generic 'eXternal' VM.  And
for the openvz/vserver folks:
vzi = VirtualiZation Internal (or In-kernel)
Grepping 2.6.16 for case-insensitive 'vzi' finds 0 matches.
Grepping 2.6.16 for case-insensitive 'vzx' finds 12 matches to 'movzx'
