The MSI subsystem should at most reserve and the driver make a request.
There may be a limit per PCI device as specified by the MSI subsystem for
some reason or other. Isn't this what we're all saying?

This sounds like a case of bad driver bug generally the kernel would oops
when the ISR text gets unloaded. What kind of behaviour do you expect
here?

I agree here, the request/free of vectors must be controllable in the
driver, this is one place where we may have to allow people to hang
themselves.

Could you elaborate further here? Won't a matched pci_disable_msix() free
the necessary resources on failure?

If the driver is doing this, then we won't have to bother about
pci_disable_msix() doing the vector free surely?
