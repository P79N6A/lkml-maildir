I think you misunderstand..  netif_rx frees the skb.  In this example:
	netif_rx(skb); /* free skb of size PKT_BUF_SZ */
	skb = dev_alloc_skb(PKT_BUF_SZ)
an alloc of a PKT_BUF_SZ'd skb immediately follows a free of a
same-sized skb.  100% of the time.
It seems an obvious shortcut to me, to have __netif_rx or similar
-clear- the skb head not free it.  No changes to memory management or
additional low memory situations created by this, AFAICS.

This requires scatter-gather hardware support, right?  If so, would this
support only exist for checksumming hardware -- like the current
zerocopy -- or would non-checksumming SG hardware like tulip be
supported too?
