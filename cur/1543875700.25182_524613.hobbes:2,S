The reason for that original patch was that it is actually possible for the
uevent functions to return -ENOMEM, the uevent buffer being statically
allocated to BUFFER_SIZE (2048). It used to be 1024 but that was not
always enough and it was doubled a while ago [1]. Using add_uevent_var()
makes this less of a problem as such an overflow should be catched
cleanly [2].

That makes sense, I guess. I will try that.
Thanks.
