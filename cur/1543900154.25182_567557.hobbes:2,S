This implementation looks interesting. No need of debug compiled
vmlinux for dump filtering purposes. No run time vmlinux binary modifications
as suggested by your previous mails. People can export kernel CONFIG info
like PAGESIZE etc with the help of this ELF note and any tool which is
processing kernel core file can benifit from this. No guesses required for
determining the page size of crashed kernel.
All the info required by dump filtering tool, put it into an ELF note, 
pass it to second kernel which appends it to final vmcore. The only concern
here again is that type of ELF note is not standard. The contents of 
ELF notes will keep on changing over a period of time. For example if a 
new memory model evolves. Now everytime this note data changes one shall
have to update mkdumpfile and user shall have to newer version. If there
are any issues, user will not come to know about the issue during kdump
service enablement time, instead it will be detected during dump 
capture time. It is too late till then.
I think we can make OSRELEASE info into a separate ELF note. Something
like a note type "UTS_RELEASE". This ELF note type then can also be 
reused for appending an ELF note to vmlinux to determine the kernel
version.

We don't have to save this info in ELF note format after the crash. This
info gets fixed once kernel is booted. I think we should save it in some
init routine and not in crash_kexec().

mkdfinfo does not seem to be very appropriate name. We probably need to have a
better name. This all seems to be debug data (symbol info, structure size,
offsets of struct members) so how about "debuginfo"?
Thanks
