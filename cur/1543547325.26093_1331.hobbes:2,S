Subject: [PressRel] v0.1.1 - the "errata" release
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

All,
Fixed up a few suggested "buglets" in the release, notably inconsistencies
in the grammar, etc. I won't bother you with big posts, so it's at
http://dustpuppy.ods.org/press-release
 - just grab it from there.
Still to do is to rewrite half the stuff, and to merge the longer details
into WWoL2.4 or similar, so the press release is designed for brevity.
