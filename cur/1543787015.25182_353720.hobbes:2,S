The problem to creating a wrapper in the manner sugegsted is that
any filesystems mounted or other stuff which uses the original device
must be stopped
and changed to start using the new pseudo device. I want something
which can be as
non intrusive as possible. Am looking @ Jens btrace :) ..
Thanks &Regards
