Hmm...downloaded 2.6.9, patched to 2.6.10-rc2, patched to 2.6.10-rc2-mm4.  Tried 
building and got the following error:
[cfriesen@hsdbsk204-83-218-112 linux-2.6.10-rc2-mm4]$ make
   CHK     include/linux/version.h
make[1]: `arch/ppc/kernel/asm-offsets.s' is up to date.
   CHK     include/linux/compile.h
   CHK     usr/initramfs_list
   GEN     .version
   CHK     include/linux/compile.h
   UPD     include/linux/compile.h
   CC      init/version.o
   LD      init/built-in.o
   LD      .tmp_vmlinux1
arch/ppc/mm/built-in.o(.init.text+0x5f4): In function `paging_init':

make: *** [.tmp_vmlinux1] Error 1
Any ideas?
