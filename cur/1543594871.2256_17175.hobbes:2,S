However, the very concept of Java encourages not caring about
"performance, system-design or any elegance whatsoever". If you cared
about any of those things you would compile to native code (it exists
for a reason). Need run-anywhere support? Distribute sources instead.
Once they are compiled they won't need to be reinterpreted on every
run.
