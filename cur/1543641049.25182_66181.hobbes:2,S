   ./include/net/ip.h
False positive, ip_finish_output is merely declared extern here with
the __inline__ attribute so that the functions args+attributes match
with what the real function definition has in net/ipv4/ip_output.c
We don't intend it to get inlined when called from other files :-)
   ./net/core/sock.c
ROFL, maybe your script is matching sk->urginline :-)
I can't find anything else in this file.
Franks a lot,
