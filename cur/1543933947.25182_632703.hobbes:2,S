yeah - and that's typical of most _p() use: most of them are totally 
bogus, but the global existence of the delay was used as a "it _might_ 
break system" boogey-man against replacing it.
so _IF_ we do any delay in x86 platform drivers, we at most do a delay 
on the order of the round-trip latency to the same piece of hardware we 
are handling. That isolates the quirk to the same hardware category, 
instead of creating these cross-dependencies and assumed dependencies on 
fixed, absolute timings. (and most hardware timing bugs are not absolute 
but depend on some bus speed/frequency, thus round-trip latency of that 
hardware is a good approximation of that. The round-trip to the same 
hardware also correctly adds any assumed PCI posting dependencies.)
So the current plan is to go with an io_delay=udelay default in v2.6.25, 
to give this a migration window, and io_delay=none in v2.6.26 [and a 
complete removal of arch/x86/kernel/io_delay.c], once the _p() uses are 
fixed up. This is gradual enough to notice any regressions we care about 
and also makes it nicely bisectable and gradual.
