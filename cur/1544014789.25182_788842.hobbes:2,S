I send :

[PATCH -tip 2/2] x86: rename all fields of mpf_intel mpf_X to X
Is this OK ?

struct mpc_ioapic and struct mpc_intsrc is based on MultiProcessor
Specification Version 1.4
But I am not able to find the specification Manual of:
struct mp_config_ioapic and struct mp_config_intsrc.
(arch/x86/include/asm/io_apic.h)
Can you please point me out why the fields of struct mp_config_ioapic
and struct mp_config_intsrc are different from MultiProcessor
Specification Version 1.4
Thanks
