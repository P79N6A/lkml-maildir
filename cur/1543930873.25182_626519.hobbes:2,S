Each platform provides its own versions of the various _p functions which
work as required for that platform.
As to megaraid, I don't have the docs so I couldn't specifically tell you
but the use in that driver looks dubious as its not an ISA/LPC device.

Most of those platforms have hardware that was designed not to need those
delays and they know that their CMOS clock etc are not clocked at half
the LPC bus clock. Thus they don't need _p.

Its an ISA bus delay on systems that need it (or an LPC bus delay on
newer ones).

measured in what, against what, for which bus.
inb_p/outb_p are really only meaningful for ISA/LPC bus devices. In those
cases it is precisely defined. Its use for PCI devices is a bit suspect
and as a general rule probably wrong.
