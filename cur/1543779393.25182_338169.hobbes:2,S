Hugh's posting said:
 "it's trying to avoid an endless loop of finding the pte not writable 
  when ptrace is modifying a page which the user is currently protected 
  against writing to (setting a breakpoint in readonly text, perhaps?)"
i'm wondering, why should that case generate an infinite fault? The 
first write access should copy the shared-library page into a private 
page and map it into the task's MM, writable. If this make-writable 
operation races with a read access then we return a minor fault and the 
page is still readonly, but retrying the write should then break up the 
COW protection and generate a writable page, and a subsequent 
follow_page() success. If the page cannot be made writable, shouldnt the 
vma flags reflect this fact by not having the VM_MAYWRITE flag, and 
hence get_user_pages() should have returned with -EFAULT earlier?
in other words, can a named MAP_PRIVATE vma with VM_MAYWRITE set ever be 
non-COW-break-able and thus have the potential to induce an infinite 
loop?
