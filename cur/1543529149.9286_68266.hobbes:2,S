   You really should call pci_enable_device(), because it not only toggles
command register bits, but also assigns resources and does other important
stuff. Just save contents of the command register before you enable the
device and then check it to see whether the device was primary or secondary
and possibly disable the I/O decoders again.
				Have a nice fortnight
