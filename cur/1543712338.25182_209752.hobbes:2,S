Larger transfers work fine in PATA, too.
WRT bridges, it is generally the best idea to limit to UDMA/100 (udma), 
but larger transfers are OK.

Yes and no, in that order :)  SATA doesn't mandate lba48, but it is 
highly unlikely that you will see SATA disk without lba48.
Regardless, libata supports what the drive supports.  Older disks still 
work just fine.
