kernelnotes.org is down for quite some time. We've noted that a few weeks
ago, as netfilter.kernelnotes.org was suddenly no longer reachable. We've
now removed the references to netfilter.kernelnotes.org and created another
mirror (netfilter.gnumonks.org) for the netfilter-related stuff.
We haven't heared anything from kernelnotes.org since
