Hi,
It seems to me the ramdisk of the new kernels(e.g. 2.3.33) doesn't hold
data at all. After I made a file system on a ramdisk with
	mke2fs -i 8192 /dev/ram0 1024
I can do :
	root[17:49:54]~#mount /dev/ram0 /mnt
	root[17:50:03]~#echo Hello!  > /mnt/t
	root[17:50:14]~#cat /mnt/t
	Hello!
which is fine. But if i unmount it and remount if right away, i get
	root[17:50:19]~#umount /mnt
	root[17:50:27]~#mount /dev/ram0 /mnt
	root[17:50:31]~#cat /mnt/t
	root[17:50:34]~#
The file is still there, just the contents are all zerod.
Am i missing something here?
