There's another reason for not doing it that way: allowing readers to keep 
interrupts on even in the presense of interrupt uses of readers.
If you do the "pending writes stop readers" approach, you get
		cpu1			cpu2
		read_lock() - get
					write_lock_irq() - pending
		irq happens
		 - read_lock() - deadlock
and that means that you need to make readers protect against interrupts 
even if the interrupts only read themselves.
NOTE! I'm not saying the existing practice is necessarily a good tradeoff,
and maybe we should just make sure to find all such cases and turn the
read_lock() calls into read_lock_irqsave() and then make the rw-locks
block readers on pending writers. But it's certainly more work and cause
for subtler problems than just naively changing the rw implementation.
