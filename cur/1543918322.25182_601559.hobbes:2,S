I'm sorry, but I don't think I understand what you mean... :-(
Could you explain more? 
Which slabs should be shrinked? kmem_cache_node and kmem_cache_cpu?
I think kmem_cache_cpu should be disabled by cpu hotplug,
not memory/node hotplug. Basically, cpu should be offlined before
memory offline on the node.
Sorry, I'm confusing now...
