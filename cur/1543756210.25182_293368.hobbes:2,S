hi all,
 	I would like point to work done by Li-Ta Lo.
 	It allows you to completely initalize the VGA BIOS w/out using
 	PC BIOS at all.
 	
http://www.clustermatic.org/pipermail/linuxbios/2005-January/010236.html
 	unforunatelly the information the web is somewhat sparse, but
 	you can get more info by following the archive of the
 	thread (which head I listed above) and perhaps by posting to
 	linuxbios mailing list (Ollie, is somewhat buy those days with his
 	new baby).
 	Either way quite amazing feat that should bring LinuxBIOS closer
 	to desktop.
