You really misread that code. It frees the buffer and returns -EFAULT if 
the copy_from_user _failed_. This is standard procedure and that code 
doesn't need to be changed to kzalloc.
Please only do kmalloc to k[zc]alloc changes that are really trivial. 
There is no point in risking inserting new bugs (or performance 
regressions) for some micro-space-optimization such as this.
