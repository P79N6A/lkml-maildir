   1 process.  1 cpu machine.  1 gige card.  As much ram as you want.  No 
   syscalls.  Must exhibit a load curve similar to:
   	y
   	|  ...............
   	| .
   	|.
   	+----------------x
   
   Where x == requests per second sent to the machine and y is the number 
   of resposes per second sent out of the machine.  Hint: read the phttpd 
   and /dev/poll papers for an idea of the breakdown that happens for larger 
   values of x (make the cpu slower to cause the interesting points to move 
   lower).  For a third dimension to the graph, make the number of total 
   connections the z axis.
Ok, TUX can do it.  Now list for me some server that really matters
other than web and ftp?  If you say databases, then I agree with you
but I will also reiterate how the people who need that level of
database performance is "nook and cranny".
I think there is nothing wrong with doing a TUX module for situations
where 1) the server is important for enough people and 2) scaling to
the levels you are talking about is a real issue for that service.
