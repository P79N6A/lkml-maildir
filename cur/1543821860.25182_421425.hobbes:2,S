Please inline your patches, so one can actually comment on them...
- You should handle sync_file() failure. If we don't have !f_op (will
  that ever hit, btw?) or ->fsync(), then fail the barrier with
  -EOPNOTSUPP. For fsync failure, well... You probably want to just
  error the bio with -EIO then.
- bio_sync() doesn't have the semantics you define it to, it is a hint
  to the block layer to start request processing instead of plugging. So
  don't treat it as a barrier, ignore it.
- Does this work for all loop_device types?
