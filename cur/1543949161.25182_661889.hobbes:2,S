Depends on how the device completes commands and what the driver does to check 
for completion.  It would probably work fine in many cases.

Sounds about right.  I've got to poke the PCIe 3.0 folks again about some of 
the potential ordering changes there; hopefully we can cover that stuff too 
with Arthur's approach.
