This bug known as the swap-reclaim bug has been there for a while since 
around 2.4.4.  Rick van Riel said that it is in the TO-DO list.
Because of this, I went back to 2.2.20pre2aa1 on UP2000 SMP.
IMHO, the current 2.4.* kernels should still be 2.3.*.  When this bug
is removed, I will come back to 2.4.*.

Hugh
