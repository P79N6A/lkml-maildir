I've rerun my tests with the rtl8180 driver and found the network to be 
reliable with the mac82011 module's ieee80211_default_rc_algo parameter set 
to either 'simple' or 'pid'.

Sorry, but that's not the case. I find the same results as without the 
patches. With the parameter set to 'pid', the network connection fails very 
quickly, but with it set to 'simple' I can ping and ftp files to and from my 
laptop as much as I like and the connection stays up. In fact, if anything 
the patches seem to have made the network even more fragile, in that it fails 
almost instantly once I start some network activity ( < 10 pings).
I'm sure this is not the hardware - it works perfectly with Windows XP, with 
2.6.23.14 plus the out-of-tree rt61 driver from serialmonkey, with the 
in-tree driver from 2.6.24.x and with 2.6.25-rc3 with the mac82011's 
ieee80211_default_rc_algo parameter set to 'simple'.
Like I say above, sorry!
Chris
