Nope, there is no process which has the camera. What has happened is that
camera is opened and the process crashes. So now the camera has to be closed

I tried all the things you suggested. Did not work.

|What does ps aux show?  Is there still a process that has the camera?  Can
|you kill -9 <pid> to get rid of that process, and does the camera then
|unlock?
