It's not supposed to work that way.

No, the mechanism would be that we only free pages from the scavenge
or cache lists.  The mapped list contains only pages which _can't_ be
freed.  The dynamic memory pressure is used to maintain a goal for the
number of pages in the cache list, and to achieve that goal, we
perform aging on the mapped list.  Pages which reach age zero can be
unmapped and added to the cache list, from where they can be
reclaimed.
In other words, the queues naturally assist us in breaking apart the
jobs of freeing pages and aging mappings.

We _must_ have separate dirty behaviour for dirty VM pages and for
writeback pages.  Think about a large simulation filling most of main
memory with dirty anon pages --- we don't want write throttling to
kick in and swap out all of that memory!  But for writeback data ---
data dirtied by the filesystem directly, not just by the VM --- we
definitely want to keep control of the amount of dirty memory.
Cheers,
 Stephen
