They can't be seperate though, I don't want:
	fill_in_stat_bits();
	zero_out_padding_parts();
because that disturbs the ascending store stream which
I'm trying to retain.
What I really want to do on Sparc64 is a special inline
assembly that looks a lot like put_user() but uses one
exception table entry for all the stores into the stat{,64}
structure in userspace.
How would you wrapper look?  Perhaps I'm confused and it
allows what I want to do.
