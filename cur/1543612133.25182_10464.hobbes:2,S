If you test with lower values, I find that the problem happens so often that
bidirectional TCP bulk throughput tests on 100Mbits/sec ethernet are 
significantly
lower.  As Tim pointed out, the RX ring size is chosen based on being large 
enough
to receive steadily and only require the ISR to come by and empty it once 
every jiffy.
In order to provide good performance and survivability on maximum packet 
rate loads,
it needs to be 1024, although it's moderately good on 512, on my 300MHz K6 
system.

The printk significantly reduces TCP throughput on my tests, it doesn't tell me
about an interesting condition, so I removed it.  This state happens any 
time the chip receives
more than a ring buffer full before the ISR can empty it, which is 
something which
is always possible.
And any way, why would you care to know?  Is there something you'ld imagine
doing because you saw the message?
