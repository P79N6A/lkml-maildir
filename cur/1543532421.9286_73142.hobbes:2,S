  Hi, all. Version 162 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
This is against 2.3.99-pre6-2. Highlights of this release:
- Set inode->i_size to correct size for symlinks
  Thanks to Jeremy Fitzhardinge <jeremy@goop.org>
- Only give lookup() method to directories to comply with new VFS
  assumptions
- Remove unnecessary tests in symlink methods
- Don't kill existing block ops in <devfs_read_inode>
- Restore auto-ownership for /dev/pty/m*
                                Regards,
                                        Richard....
