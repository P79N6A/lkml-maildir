I think this is a bad idea -- when doing a new port, it's easier to fill
in the bits with the current scheme rather than with your proposed scheme.
There is one part which I like:
-/* for old implementation of bsd flock () */
-#define F_EXLCK		4	/* or 3 */
-#define F_SHLCK		8	/* or 4 */
All of these can go, nobody's been using them since kernel 2.0.  I took
out the last vestiges of them from locks.c earlier in 2.5.  None of the
BSDs have them either.
