That's unlikely, since again this will be unused by the all but iscsi
users. But you can be tricky and replace skb destructor with your own
pointer and call 'old' destructor yourself. Its main goal is to adjust
socket memory statistics and since all iscsi sockets are under your full
control, you can play with it. Although this sounds like a hack, with
proper implementation it is not that bad idea. As additional pointer you
can use sk_user_data which is used by rpc socket calls only iirc.
