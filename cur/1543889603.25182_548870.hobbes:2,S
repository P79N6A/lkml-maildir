Actually I saw this "lost interrupts" spew on the host (ie the
non-virtualized kernel) running just plain qemu (no kvm or anything
scary like that).  It seemed to be some long irqs-off latency in the
tun/tap or bridging code (it went away when I stopped using "-net tap"
on the qemu command line), but I never succeeded in getting Ingo's
latency tracer to be able to track it down.
