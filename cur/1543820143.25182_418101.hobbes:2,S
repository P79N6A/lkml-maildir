before he detained and has been sentenced to jail for not paying taxes and 
financing political parties (the union of right forces, led by Mr. Boris Ne
mtsov and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yavlinsk
y) opposed to the government of Mr. Vladmir Putin, the president thereby le
ading to the freezing his finances and assets.
After searching through the books of your countrys chambers of commerce 
and industries here in Russia I am contacting you to assist me to re-profil
e this fund and equally invest this fund in your country.
The total amount of these funds to be re-profiled is forty six million doll
ars (USD 46,000,000.00) and you will be getting 20% for your assistance.
I shall furnish you with necessary informations and my identifications a
s soon I receive your acceptance which should be sent to my private email b
ox malekseev@myway.com

Ms. Maria Alekseev
