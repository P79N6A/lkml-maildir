What about PCI write posting ? How can we enforce the 400ns delay here ?
I suspect we can't read back from the taskfile registers after writing
the command. Especially when using DMA, I think I remember Andre telling
me even tapping alt status might not be safe... So we need to issue
a read from the same bus path, but not on any taskfile register from
this channel... hrm... any idea ?

Yup, that's an old problem indeed.
