That could lead to a possible problem. We're just lucky that no file in
the Coda code has __ASSEMBLY__ defined.

Actually all coda_XXX.h files don't even have to be in include/linux/,
only coda.h contains structs/defines that should be 'visible' outside of
the Coda kernel code, anything else should just go to fs/coda and get a
good dust off to remove a bunch of cruft.

Gee, oh well. I didn't consider it 'critical bug-fixes only' or
important enough to push a patch for a maintainers entry into a stable
series, and obviously wasn't paying attention during 2.3 development.
Besides I've been sending you updates whenever something critical
changes in coda.o (considering you are using it for podfuk). I would
figure that of all people at least you would know.
