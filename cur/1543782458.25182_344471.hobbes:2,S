This introduces a subtle ordering requirement, where setup_thread_info 
magically finds in the new task_struct the pointer to the old thread_info 
to setup the new thread_info.
What is your problem with what I have in CVS? There it completes the basic
task_struct setup and _after_ that it can setup the thread_info.
Al, I would really prefer to merge this one myself, I'm only waiting for 
the 2.6.13 release and since this is not a regression, I don't really 
understand why this must be in 2.6.13.
bye, Roman
