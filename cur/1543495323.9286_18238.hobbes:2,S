Hi,
here is a kernel oops I seem to get very regularly.  the system is an
Asus P2bDS? dual PII with 512meg ram kernel is 2.2.7 .  There are no NFS
file systems on this box.
I think this could be linked to a problem I'm having with phantom loads
and sleeping find process running in state D
 2:54pm  up 6 days,  1:03,  6 users,  load average: 1.03, 1.01, 1.00
86 processes: 85 sleeping, 1 running, 0 zombie, 0 stopped
CPU states:  1.1% user,  2.7% system,  0.0% nice, 96.2% idle     
3554  ?  D    0:01 find / ( -fstype nfs -o -fstype NFS -o -type d -regex
\(^/tm
the problem is occuring in both smp mode and non-smp mode.  I'm guessing
(becuase I don't know much of how kernels work...) that there is no time
out for NFS file systems... in the interim, I'm going to kill updatedb
from the cron as I believe this is the parent process.  I can't kill the
find process.
any patches/ideas would be very helpfull... at the moment, I'm
struggling to get more than two weeks of uptime out of what should be an
enterprise server.
Cheers
Craig
