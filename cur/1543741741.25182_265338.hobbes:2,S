- - Convince the security people

I've tried that.  They don't want to.  I don't blame them.
What I *am* aiming for is getting a few security enhancements included
in mainline for several Linux distributions, starting with Debian and
Ubuntu.  This will predictibly create a blockage at 2.6.7 (where
PaX/GRSec are, since those are a major part of the scheme); they won't
be able to upgrade past there without losing a major protection, and the
authors will likely continue to simply sit around and wait for 2.6 to
stop changing so damn much.
| (c) Some combination of the two.
|
| Either would probably be more likely to fulfill your needs than just
| whining about it.
