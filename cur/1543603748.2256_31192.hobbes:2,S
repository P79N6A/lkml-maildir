Pretty much.  The second one also reorganises various areas of the
kernel which can traverse very long lists when under spinlocks.

I haven't seen any rigorous latency measurements on Rob's stuff, and
I haven't seriously measured the reschedule-based patch for months.  But
I would expect the preempt patch to perform significantly worse because
it doesn't attempt to break up the abovementioned long-held locks.  (It can
do so, though - a straightforward adaptation of the reschedule patch's
changes will fix it).

Controversial.  My vague feeling is that they shouldn't.  Here's
why:
The great majority of users and applications really only need
a mostly-better-than-ten-millisecond latency.  This gives good
responsiveness for user interfaces and media streaming.  This
can trivially be achieved with the current kernel via a thirty line
patch (which _should_ be applied to 2.4.x.  I need to get off my
butt).
But the next rank of applications - instrumentation, control systems,
media production sytems, etc require 500-1000 usec latencies, and
the group of people who require this is considerably smaller.  And their
requirements are quite aggressive.  And maintaining that performance
with either approach is a fair bit of work and impacts (by definition)
the while kernel.  That's all an argument for keeping it offstream.

The rescheduling patch should work fine on any architecture - just copy
the arch/i386/config.in changes.
