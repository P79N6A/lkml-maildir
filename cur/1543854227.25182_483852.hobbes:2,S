Subject: uml fails to compile due to missing offsetof

I fail to see how arch/um/sys-i386/user-offsets.c can compile since
offsetof() was declared __KERNEL__ only in include/linux/stddef.h.
Does it work for anyone else? If so, is linux/stddef.h or
/usr/include/linux/stddef.h used during compilation?
The x86_64 variant looks weird as well, linux/stddef.h is appearently
included via some other headers.
