And you always will be. The amount of pain involved in implementing
this, just so that people can call their serial port 'ttyS0', is _far_
more than it's worth. It could be done, but it's a completely pointless
waste of time and effort. 
Separate device names work just fine. It's simpler, and for many people
it's preferable because it gives more repeatability to device names.
With the current patch I _know_ that ttyPZ0 is the built-in z8530
controller and ttyS0 is the PCMCIA modem, for example.
The argument that people shouldn't need to know what type of port they
have is a red herring. They're going to have to work out what _number_
it is anyway, and sharing the major numbers just makes that _harder_.
Graphical tools are also a red herring -- if the graphical tools are
broken and don't show non-8250 ports, then they can be fixed.
