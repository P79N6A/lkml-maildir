While you're at it, could you patch it up so we can have more than one
serial device again?  I tracked down a bug a month ago having to do
with the pmac_zilog driver freaking out because it tried to 
  uart_register(major=TTY_MAJOR, minor=64, nr=foo)
and someone else had gotten there first.  It boils down to a call
to register_chrdev_region(), which fails if the requested space is
taken, instead of looking past the claimed device numbers for some
more empty ones...
