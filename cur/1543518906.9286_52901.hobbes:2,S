hmm, i can't see this taking more that a few hundred bytes. it's not
like every syscall would need a special entry point, and every one
of them would be in a dozen versions.
What was proposed so far wouldn't involve more than having a pair of
very simple ("lea 4(%esp),%ebp;sysenter"-type) sequences, possibly in
two or three versions, plus a small routine for really special cases
(gettimeofday).
