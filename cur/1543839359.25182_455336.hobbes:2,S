Hi,
I noticed that mplayer's video playback starts to skip
if I do some serious copying or grepping on the disk
with movie being played from.
nice helps, but does not eliminate the problem.
I guessed that this is a problem with mplayer
failing to read next portion of input data in time,
so I used Jens's ionice.c from
Documentation/block/ioprio.txt
I am using it this:
ionice -c1 -n0 -p<mplayer pid>
but so far I don't see any effect from using it.
mplayer still skips.
Does anybody have an experience in this?
