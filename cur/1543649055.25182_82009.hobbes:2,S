Subject: sundance driver hangup - extra
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Note:
I tried compiling and installing the newest driver from D-Link, and I get:
"dlh5x device does not seem to be present, delaying eth0 initialization"
which is odd, because an immediate modprobe sundance works fine.
Thanks again,
Austin
