    I am not so sure it is a good idea to merge them.  A lot of the
common/similar code got removed from both sd.c and sr.c when I did the
rewrite of the queueing code.

    Is this what that ghost stuff is really for?  There is a much easier way
of doing this, you know.  There is no technical reason why the same
Scsi_Device cannot be driven by both drivers - the only thing you would need
to do is to teach sd.c that it should also attach to DVD RAM drives.
    If I had to guess, all you would need to do is to fix it so that
scsi_scan() first marked the Scsi_Device as writable, and then a couple of
minor edits to sd.c so that it treats the combination of TYPE_ROM with the
writable flag set as equivalent to TYPE_MOD.
