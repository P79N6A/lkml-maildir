Hi:
If I replace the 2.4.9-ac9 hamachi.c file with the one from the stock RH
7.1 kernel distribution it works fine on the P-III and the alpha.  I
even get better performance with 2.4.9-ac9 than with the stock kernel
(340 Mb/s vs. 325 Mb/s).  There were a lot of changes in hamachi.c
between the two versions. Insmoding the driver with debug=10 showed
these 4 error numbers:
0f32e812 (CRC) 0f32c812 (CRC) 0bc25012 00d30812 (CRC).  From reading the
source, three of those point to CRC, the other isn't mentioned.  I don't
have the hamachi data sheets to look up any other possible errors.  I'm
quite willing to test any fixes if anyone has any ideas.
