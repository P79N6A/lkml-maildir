I'm quite aware of that, but I still think Sun has more resources to get 
their particular viewpoint through the committee -- it's just a matter 
of resources at hand.  I myself had to largely drop out due to other 
pressures, for example.
Now, I'm much happier with Solaris being rubber-stamped than some other 
possibilities.  However, it's very easy to sweep concerns under the rug 
by saying "legacy, out of scope."
