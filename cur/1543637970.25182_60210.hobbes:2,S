Hey Ben, That sounds great. Have been looking forward to it 
to find out how much has changed and if you've left anything 
for us to do :) (other than docs and driver fixes :( ) 
I did have an updated version of the bio traversal patch 
(for 2.5.29) that avoids modifications to the bv_offset/bv_len
fields by the block layer, though I don't know if you 
still need it. Besides, you probably wouldn't run into
those cases often, as the partial request completions 
are probably rare. But just as a fyi ... 
Regards
Suparna
