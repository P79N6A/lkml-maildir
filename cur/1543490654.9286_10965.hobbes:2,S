This is an area where I am interested.  I have written the IRIX compatible
API (almost done with COMPLETE rewrite. Real Soon Now.) and am making
wrappers for the sys-V API, and others, too.
One thing I am looking at as a pretty major thing would be run-queues on a
per-processor basis.
For example (without a whole lot of thought put into this) what do people
think of this:
* there is a 'general' queue, which is for tasks which can run on any
processor(s)
* each CPU has a run-queue.  Tasks bound to this queue have a higher goodness
than tasks in the 'general' queue.
