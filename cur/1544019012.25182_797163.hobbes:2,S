It's worked OK for the great majority of callers.

Blocking leads to deadlocks.

per CPU.  Plus there's the `ps aux | wth?' effect.
We've busted a gut over far, far less.
Plus the bugfixed, undeadlockable version will be more expensive still.

spose so, if the CPU can do mwait?  If the CPU was idle, etc.  If a CPU
was busy then the call could take a long time.

Can't see it.
In fact all work_on_cpu() handlers in
arch/x86/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c appear to be atomic. 
Couldn't the whole thing be converted to use smp_call_function_many()?
