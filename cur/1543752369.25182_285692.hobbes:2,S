That's an easy task.

Why do you want to use syslog with syscall3? syslogd and klogs will
prepare /var/log/messages for you, so you just need to read() it and
write() it to a different file.

No need for that. You shouldn't fiddle directly with your operating
system's syscall interface. You should use libc's wrappers instead,
which will also correctly set errno and all the like.

Actually, you don't need to know anything about Linux' internals, Linux'
syscall interface etc. You only need to know about the
POSIX/SuSv3/whatever interface the libc presents to userspace. If you
directly use system calls, you'll loose portability and need to fight
against stupid problems like this one.

The bottom line is that this isn't a kernel-related question, so you'd
probably ask on a C beginner's mailing list...
See:
man 2 open
man 2 close
man 2 read
man 2 write
