2.1.x up through x=132 has been working well.  Thamks guys.  Today I get
the chance to go through the Changes file to update my RedHat 5.2 system
for all the 2.2 requirements; everything goes well except for
util-linux, which Changes lists v 2.9 as being required for 2.2.
Therein lies the problem.
Updating util-linux to 2.9 requires an updated libslang.  Updating
libslang would break numerous other packages, including gecko, lynx,
slrn, etc.  In particular I can't lose lynx and slrn.  Updating those
packages requires further updates.  Now I'm stuck in a twisty maze of
circular dependencis, all alike.
So now I have several choices.  I can choose to not update util-linux, I
can chase down all dependencies and upgrade, or go whole hog (!?) and do
a full rawhide upgrade.  The least objectionable of these choices is
sticking with util-linux 2.8.  What will break if I do that?
Changes says the updated package takes care of > 128M swap partition and
has an updated mount utility.  Since my single swap partition is 72M,
and I'm not using NFS, automount, pcmcia, or other esoterica will I be
safe?
