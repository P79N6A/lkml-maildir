Back to the start. 
get_free_page now handles two different types of memory. DMA-able and
non-DMA. Currently that suffices. The time will come pretty soon when 
however this is no longer sufficient. For example we'll be confronted
with a 32-bit PCI card which can DMA into the lower 4G of memory pretty
quickly. 
We're in the process of getting "> 2G mem" support. This adds another
class: bigmem. 
I think we should take a step back, abstract the GFP mechansism to the
point where it can satisfy a "gimmy any page" request, which
technically turns into "preferably a page from non-DMA memory, but if
you're out of those, give me a DMA-able page".
A driver wanting to do DMA will request "a DMA-ABLE page" (with either
the 16M ISA limit, the 1M XT limit, or the 4G PCI limit!), with "if
you're out of those, give up". 
I think that GFP may need to be redesigned one time or another.
However, once that is done, taking along things as "uncached" pages,
should become a breeze. Yes, the current implementation makes it a
quick hack to vmalloc.
I think that generalizing gfp is a good idea in the end.
