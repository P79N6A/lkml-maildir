Everyone
I am talking about attempting to invoke unknown vender specific commands
They do comply with the SPEC but are not part of the SPEC.
Since I do not have the priviledge of knowing these facts, but know they
exist.  You can not allow a rouge driver attempt to invoke these commands.
This is how disks are/can be damaged.
Controllers are limited to what the driver tells it to do.
This is why it is a kernel level issue, I am taking responsiblity for not
fixing this earlier but I just figured it out have being wacked in the
head with it three months ago.
Cheers,
Andre Hedrick
