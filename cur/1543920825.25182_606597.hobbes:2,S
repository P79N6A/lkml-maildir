a lot of experiecne has gone into that...
When preparing patches, always think "how will this appear to someone who
is reading it in the git tree a year from now".
Obviously stuff like "[patch 2/4]" won't be there, because it is
meaningless once the patch hits the git tree.  Also text such as "the previous
patch" and "my patch from yesterday" and "John Doe's comments" and lots of
other stuff which is appropriate to an email conversation is _not_
appropriate to a permanent git commit.

Thanks.  That's much better than having me invent the subject, because when
you choose the title, everyone agrees on what the patch is _called_ (as
long as the title isn't so poorly chosen that I have to fix it).
If the patch title is well-chosen then it becomes a nice google search key,
so if someone wants to find out what we were thinking when we did a
particular patch two years ago, they can just google for the title and go
and read all the email discussion.

Actual code?  That sounds hard ;)
