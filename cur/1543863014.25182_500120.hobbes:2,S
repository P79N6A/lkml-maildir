  oh, *that* part i knew.  what i don't understand is the difference
between "inline", "__inline" and "__inline__".  you can see in
include/linux/compiler-gcc4.h:
#ifdef CONFIG_FORCED_INLINING
# undef inline
# undef __inline__
# undef __inline
# define inline                 inline          __attribute__((always_inline))
# define __inline__             __inline__      __attribute__((always_inline))
# define __inline               __inline        __attribute__((always_inline))
#endif
  so that header file certainly suggests that there's some sort of
difference.  after which it gets even more confusing as various macros
seem to mix and match:
  drivers/cdrom/sbpcd.c:#define INLINE inline
  arch/arm/nwfpe/ARM-gcc.h:#define INLINE extern __inline__
  arch/cris/arch-v10/kernel/fasttimer.c:#define __INLINE__ inline
  arch/alpha/mm/fault.c:#define __EXTERN_INLINE inline
  ... etc etc ...
  i mean, how many different kinds of inline *are* there?

p.s.  apparently, some of the alpha people are less than thrilled with
the situation:
include/asm-alpha/compiler.h:
-----------------------------
#ifdef __KERNEL__
/* Some idiots over in <linux/compiler.h> thought inline should imply
   always_inline.  This breaks stuff.  We'll include this file whenever
   we run into such problems.  */
#include <linux/compiler.h>
#undef inline
#undef __inline__
#undef __inline
#undef __always_inline
#define __always_inline         inline __attribute__((always_inline))
#endif /* __KERNEL__ */
