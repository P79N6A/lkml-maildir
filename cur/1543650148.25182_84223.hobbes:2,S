   I like your patch, but what has changed?  Are those platforms which
   were using flush_page_to_ram() now committed to its elimination?
   Or have they already replaced it (not seen in your patch)?
   
No they have to fix their port to use the supported interface,
simply.  That's why I added the "#error " lines telling the person
compiling on such a platform what needs to happen.
