I don't see a problem here requiring root. Once the filter is turned off 
for the device, say in rc.local, and the ownership and permissions are 
set, there's no issue. It can be owned by root, group cdwriters, have 
permissions 0660, and cdrecord or other trusted programs can be setgid 
once the kernel stop blocking such access.

No need to do any daily tasks in a dangerous mode, access would be 
limited to users and programs regarded as trusted.

If this could be added it would presumably not change.

No, as I noted, programs other than cdrecord are clever enough to avoid 
requiring disallowed commands.

I put lkml back on the recipients, I'm suggesting a new ioctl as a way 
around the decision to no longer have setuid/setgid actually fully 
functional.
