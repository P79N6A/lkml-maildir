Ben is talking about the long-planned "irq_action->handler() returns a
code that indicates progress" approach Linus talked about. *that* needs
the changing of every driver, since every IRQ handler prototype that is
'void' now needs to be changed to return 'int'. (the change is trivial,
but intrusive.)
