Heh, yeah right, might as well just add the following also if we are in
the CYA mode:
What:	Broken function parameters and entire functions
When:	As soon as noticed
Files:	All
Why:	See Documentation/stable_api_nonesense.txt for why this is
	necessary.
Who:	Greg Kroah-Hartman <greg@kroah.com> and others.
But I think this file is for specific things, the above, and your entry,
shouldn't be needed.  Well, I would hope so, but odds are it might be
necessary just to keep from answering the same questions all the time...
thanks,
