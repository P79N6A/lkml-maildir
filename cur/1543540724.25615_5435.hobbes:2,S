Well, you could try switching to a 2.2.xx kernel and compiling
"glibc".  It wouldn't be conclusive, but it would certainly greatly
reduce or increase the probability that it's a kernel bug.

Could this be the difference between the "glibc" and other compiles?
Perhaps "glibc", by default, does a parallel make?  Does the kernel
compilation still work if you pass "-j3" to "make" (or change the line
in the top-level Makefile to "MAKE=make -j3")?
