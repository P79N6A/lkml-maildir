If there is an already merged driver that is marked as broken for a long 
time, there are usually two possible cases:
- it is really unused
- patches to fix it are pending or floating around
A patch to remove a driver is usually the best way for getting the 
information which case a driver belongs into (a good example might be 
the zr36120 driver that seems to have found a new maintainer due to my 
removal patch).
And if there's no reaction, the usefullness of very outdated and 
usually non-compiling code is quite questionable.
