Hi Patrick
Thanks a lot, it really works.  I applied this patch to my 2.2.16 kernel.
But the only issue is that if I do a sigwait on my main thread, to catch all
signals (  my server works this way.  Main thread is supposed to get all
signals.) , the  same thing happens.  ie.  manager thread becomes defunc.
Any idea?
