How we got here:
	- we made changes to PCI core that says,
	  "/sys/bus/pci/slots/ is for _physical_ slots"
	- that series of changes broke an existing interface
	  (fakephp) that had real users
	- the existing interface was interesting because it was
	  the only way that allowed for function level hotplug
So, if we can get function level hotplug via a different
interface (by adding a "remove" attribute to pci-sysfs), then I
don't really see a strong reason to keep fakephp.
We also don't want to break existing software (more than we
already have :-/ ) so we need a transition period to get users
over to the new "remove" interface.
A deprecation period is usually pretty long, several years, iirc.

Ok, well I haven't seen dummyphp.
I don't think we should really care that much about dummyphp vs.
new fakephp as long as we complete the end goal, which in my
opinion is:
	/sys/bus/pci/slots/ represents physical slots and device hotplug
	/sys/devices/<bus>/<function>/remove used for function hotplug
If we can use dummyphp to get us through the transition period,
meaning it can:
	- provide an interface compatible with fakephp
	- allow recursive hotplug (remove a bridge and all
	  functions behind it)
	- recognize if a function has been hotplugged via a
	  different interface
	- relatively simple implementation
Then I'm sure that Trent won't mind whether we use your dummyphp
or his new fakephp.
I'm wondering though, if dummyphp uses the PCI hotplug API, it
will probably suffer from the same limitation that the current
fakephp does, which is that the PCI hotplug core will only allow
drivers to claim on a _device_ level, not _function_ level.
Care to post dummyphp for us to see?
Thanks.
