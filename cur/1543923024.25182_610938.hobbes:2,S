Not quite. Now I get
OEM info:                0
while before I got empty string. If I read acpi_extract_package correctly, it 
actually interpreted integer as string without any conversion. Which in this 
case obviously gave us empty string (integer being 0). I'd prefer to remain 
compatible.
also
{pts/1}% cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/manufacturer
0
which is rather weird manufacturer name :)
