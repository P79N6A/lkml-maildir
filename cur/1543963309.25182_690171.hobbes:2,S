Subject: [PATCH] Mark res_counter_charge(_locked) with __must_check
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/5/8/109

Ignoring theirs return value may result in counter underflow
in the future - when the value charged will be uncharged (or in
"leaks" - when the value is not uncharged).
This also prevents from using charging routines to decrement the
counter value (i.e. uncharge it) ;)
(Current code works OK with res_counter, however :) )
