I'm not going to get up in arms about this unless there's a serious
performance issue that's going to get smacked down that I want to have
a say in how it gets smacked down. aa is happy with the filebacked
stuff, so I'm not pressing it (much) further.
And yes, page clustering is certainly on its way and fast. I'm getting
very close to the point where a general announcement will be in order.
There's basically "one last big bug" and two bits of gross suboptimality
I want to clean up before bringing the world to bear on it.
