Im a bit puzzled by this one.
I had my machine working perfectly, rebooted into windows 98, then
turned the machine off. Since I have done this my machine locks
hard if I insert the smc-ultra module, but not immediately.
I am using redhat 6.0 and it does all the init.d scripts then
switches to the login prompt which is where it locks up. Not
even Sysreq works.
The kernel version is 2.2.13 and the card is SMC 8912. I have
got a feeling it is the card at fault and not the kernel
and I was wondering does anyone have any ideas.
