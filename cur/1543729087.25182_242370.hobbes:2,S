We're running Dual Opterons (Tyan S2875 boards) with 2GB ram.
These boards only have 32bit pci slots so we're already not using the full 
potential of the 3Ware.
Basically write performance is a major bottleneck (hardware raid-5 with 250GB 
sata drives) and writing anything over a few meg usually causes the machine 
to stall while the write occurs.
