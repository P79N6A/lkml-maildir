It is also the model we used until OLS this year - there was a 2.6
release about once a month prior to OLS.  Post OLS, it's now once
every three months or there abouts, which, IMO is far too long.
I really liked the way pre-OLS 2.6 was working... it means I don't
have to twiddle my fingers getting completely bored waiting for the
next 2.6 release to happen.  Can we return to that methodology please?
