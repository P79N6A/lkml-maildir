Those are forward port of what we had there already. I make IDE child
of PCI device with the controller (in cases its on PCI). That seems
logical place for it and we had it like that in 2.5.30 or
so. ide-disk.c is there to make disk sleep before we go
suspend. Without that, data corruption happens.
