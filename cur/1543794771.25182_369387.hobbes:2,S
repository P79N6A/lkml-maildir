There's a problem in the general conception that user/developer is a
mutex.  The whole idea is that anyone may become a developer at will.  A
division of Documentation/ to make an artificial distinction that the
community doesn't necessarily believe in doesn't seem too useful.
Now, I don't mean to suggest that you're wrong; I'm sure you have a valid
point.  If I may rephrase, it sounds more like you're looking for
"fingertip reference" versus "in-depth documentation".  The documents
that exist may not conform themselves well to that sort of division,
necessarily.  However, I'm sure that there exist fingertip references
outside of Documentation/ and the kernel tree; many of them are for
'newbies'.
Is this a useful interpretation?  Would an incorporation of this sort of
functional division meet your request?  Does anyone have the time to
devote to it?  Am I just reading out of the bit bucket?
