It's one of the four numa policies: DEFAULT, PREFERED, INTERLEAVE, BIND
It just means allocate on the local node if possible, otherwise fall back.
You said you wanted INTERLEAVE by default, which i think is a bad idea.
It should be only optional like in all other allocations.

The problem is that get_user_pages needs to handle the case of a large
page not yet being faulted in properly. The SLES9 implementation did
some changes for this.
You don't change it at all, so I'm suspect it doesn't work yet.
It's a common case - think people doing raw IO on huge pages shared memory.
