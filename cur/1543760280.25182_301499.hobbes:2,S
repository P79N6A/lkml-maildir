Do you have them on HTTP somewhere ? Apparently, a few of the 15 patches
didn't make it to me.
There are some other bugs introduced by set_pte_at() caused by latent
bugs in the PTE walkers that 'drop' part of the address along the way,
notably the vmalloc.c ones are bogus, thus breaking ppc/ppc64 in subtle
ways. Before I send patches, I'd rather check if it's not all fixed by
your patches first :)
Ben.
