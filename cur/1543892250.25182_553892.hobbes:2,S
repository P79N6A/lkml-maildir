This is what a community disjoint to mainline development has hacked
cramfs in their trees into.  Not a good rationale.  This whole
"but we've always done it" attitute is a little annoying, really.
FYI: Cartsten had an xip fs for s390 aswell, and that evolved into
the filemap.c bits after a lot of rework an quite a few round of
review.

I can't find a reference to AXFS anywhere in this thread.

Yes.  This is the highlevel way to go, just please don't hack it into
cramfs.
