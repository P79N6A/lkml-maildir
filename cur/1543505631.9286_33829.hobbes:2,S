Be careful about signal versus exception. Signal has a specific meaning in
Unix that is different.

I'm not suprised 8). You can do this. The best example of it is the
copy_*_user functions (include/asm-i386/uaccess.h)
You want the asm code to look like
	1:	wrmsr blah
	2:
	.section .fixup, "ax"
	3:	code to handle fault
		jmp 2b		# Back to the original code path
	.previous
	.section __ex_table, "a"
		.align 4
		.long 1b,3b
	.previous
What happens when you get a fault is the kernel walks the exception table
looking for the fault address (thats the piece in the __ex_table. If it
finds the address it jumps to the fault handler address. If not it
follows the normal path.
