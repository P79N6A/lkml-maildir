I was just browsing its sources:
+       if (tz->policy.temperature >=
+               tz->policy.critical.threshold->temperature) {
+               DEBUG_PRINT(ACPI_WARN, ("Critical threshold reached - shutting down system.\n"));
+               /* TODO: 'halt' */
+       }
Are you sure that kill(init, SIGTERM) is not right answer here?

PS: This seems very strange. What if machine is so crashed so that it
can no longer shutdown properly. Will that mean that its CPU will
damage itself?
