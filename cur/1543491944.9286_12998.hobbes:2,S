GNU false ALWAYS "exit with value other then zero" when called without options
and operands. I can not see how text above imply that false should IGNORE
arguments. If such thing as additional arguments not specified by POSIX are
bugs then [almost] all GNU utilities are buggy: most of them will allow
additional arguments.
When GNU true and false used according to POSIX (i.e. without arguments) then
work like POSIX specify.
