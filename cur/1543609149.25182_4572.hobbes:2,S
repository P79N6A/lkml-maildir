We also need a way to satisfy very large allocations for the hashes (eg
the pagecache hash). On a 32G machine we get awful performance on the
pagecache hash because we can only get an order 9 allocation out of
get_free_pages:

When switching to vmalloc the hash is large enough to be useful:

As pointed out by Davem and Ingo we should try and avoid vmalloc here
due to tlb trashing.
