Well, in practice it was already possible to disable all I2C options at
once. The real difference is that it's now done directly from the main
Device Drivers menu. And we no longer have to express the dependency on
I2C in each Kconfig entry, which is nice.
The patch looks OK to me, except that it needs to be adjusted for the
current state of the i2c subsystem. This kind of patch should be built
on top on Andrew Morton's latest tree, not Linus Torvalds'.
What is the merge plan?
