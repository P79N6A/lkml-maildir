If that is really _the_ defining difference, then we are _seriously_ 
screwed.
Here are a few items I would consider in choosing a timer:
- reading time: to program a timer you have to read the time first, 
reading jiffies is practically free, whereas reading the precise time can 
be very expensive. With the right hardware it can be optimized to be quite 
cheap, but if portability is important you may want to avoid the extra 
cost.
- calculations: jiffies is a long integer whereas ktime_t is 64bit, so if 
you need a lot of complex time calculation, you should take the cost for 
32bit archs into account.
- resolution: how precise must the timer be? jiffies can't represent time 
values less than 1ms, but if time is e.g. measured in 10th of a second,
jiffies may be enough.
- timer life time: if only a short interval is needed (e.g. a fraction of 
a second) timer_list is often a lot cheaper.

Let's ignore the name for a moment, let's instead prioritize the above 
list.
If your item of whether a timer does expire or not is really the most 
important criteria for choosing a timer, I will accept any name you want.
