There are three things I'd like to do in that area
1.	Make a release function mandatory (and I'm happy to paste it into the
old scsi drivers)
2.	Call eh_abort/eh_reset_* without taking the lock as we do now
3.	Make all the midlayer callers use scatter gather lists for all
	requests.
#1 and #3 are I think doable for 2.6, #2 is a bit more questionable.
(#3 is easy because drivers supporting the old non sg case still work
just fine)
