Ok, there are two separate problems here:
1. The sysfs intf entry is not created, and this causes the oops later
when trying to remove the entry, etc.
   I've tracked this problem back to this patch: 
	[PATCH] driver core: fix error handling in bus_add_device
http://www.kernel.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=ca2b94ba12f3c36fd3d6ed9d38b3798d4dad0d8b
   Once the patch above is reverted, I have no more oops, my driver can
be loaded/unloaded just fine, and the /sys/devices/.../ is present.
   However, I'm not really sure if the problem comes from the above
patch or from my driver which should manually call
usb_create_sysfs_intf_files() or something equivalent.
2. There is still a problem with the early loading of the driver. If
loaded at boot, it won't work. If I rmmod/insmod it later it does.
Stelian.
