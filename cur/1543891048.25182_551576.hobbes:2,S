Why would you use futex_unlock_pi64?
In fact, the whole 64-bit futex patch should be reviewed and cut down
to the bare minimum. I know, I was asking for it loudly but it became
to Jakub and me after adding the private futexes that all these
orthogonal extensions don't make sense.  So far we need 64-bit futexes
only for some rwlocks and here only a few operations (wait, wake).  We
don't need 64-bit extended to PI, we don't need requeue.
Yes, if we had started out with 64-bit futexes on 64-bit platforms,
that would be fine.  But as it is today making 64-bit a new dimension
is not needed.
