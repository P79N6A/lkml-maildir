Not everyone will end up using it ... if people want to log bugs from
lkml into bugzilla, I think that'd help gather a critical mass.
Are you getting a lot of bug-reports for serial code on lkml? I use it
heavily, and it seems to work just fine to me .... so I pick (1). Yay! ;-)
Some of the bugs in there lie fallow, but I've seen quite a few get fixed.
The fact that some people (Dave Jones springs to mind) trawl through there
being extremely helpful fixing things is very useful ;-) Lots of things got
fixed, though I can't *prove* it was solely due to it being in Bugzilla.
As the list of bugs increases, it'll become an increasingly powerful 
search engine for information as well .... I'll draw up a list of things
that don't seem to being worked on, and mail it out to kernel-janitors
and/or lkml and see if people are interested in fixing some of the fallow
stuff.
