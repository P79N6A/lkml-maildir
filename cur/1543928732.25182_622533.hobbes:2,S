Ahh... okay.. but since nobody is actually actively trying
to "find the root cause", there's a problem with that approach.
Rather than have systems continue to crash (reboot required to regain
use of USB after the Oops), here is an improved version of the patch
that addresses Greg's concern.
This version still prevents the Oops, but also flags the BUG so that
it will not go unnoticed.
This should make everyone happier.

While doing insert/remove (quickly) tests on USB, I managed to trigger
an Oops on 2.6.23.1 on the call to strlen() in make_class_name().
This patch prevents the oops, but still keeps the bug visible.
There is still the larger problem of the overall race
that caused this in the first place, but much of the rest
of the code in class.c appears to also do NULL checks to
avoid Oops'ing, so this continues the tradition.
