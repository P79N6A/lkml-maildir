Subject: make NFS work with 64KB page-size

NFS currently bugs out on kernels with a page size of 64KB.  The
reason is a mismatch between RPCSVC_MAXPAGES and a calculation in
svc_init_buffer().  I'm not entirely certain which calculation is the
right one, but if I understand the code correctly, RPCSVC_MAXPAGES is
right and svc_init_buffer() is wrong.  The patch below fixes the
latter.
If the patch looks right, could you make sure it finds its way into
Linus' tree?
Thanks,
