Subject: [PATCH for testing] 1/2 central workspace for zlib, for 2.5.70
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This is a very stupid port from the 2.4 code.  Quite enough for 99.9%
of all users, but the final one should register callbacks for cpus
being added and removed.
Patch 2/2 applies to both 2.4.20 and 2.5.70, so I won't resend.
