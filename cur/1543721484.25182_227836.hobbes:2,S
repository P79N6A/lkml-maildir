Hi Andi,
	you asked:
| On what CPUs does the failure occur? Linux uses different paths
| depending on if the CPU supports SSE or not.
Travis responded:
| We run on both AMDs (Durons and Athlons) as well as PII, PIII, and 
| PIV's. Our kernels are all compiled as generic 586+. Though when we were 
| testing for this, we did try the more generic 486+ option, as well as 
| exact processor matches for the AMD at least. I don't remember it making 
| a difference.

| This sounds like a serious kernel bug that should be fixed if
| true. Can you perhaps create a simple demo program that shows the
| problem and post it?

| Does your program receive signals? Could it be related to them?
