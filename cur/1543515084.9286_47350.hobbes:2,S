I am writing a SCSI driver for a custom device.
I am allocating memory on using scsi_malloc in  queuecommand 
and using  Scsi_Cmnd.host_scribble to remember it.  
Is it OK to free this using scsi_free in the interrupt handler?

Is there a seperate linux scsi driver mailing list?

please post a copy to sara@procsys.com as i am not in the mailing list?
