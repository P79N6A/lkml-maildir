Yep, most of the currently practiced optimizations.  Given that CPU clock
frequencies are not rising as quickly as they once did, I would expect
that there will be added effort on implementing the known more-aggressive
optimization techniques, and on coming up with new ones as well.
Some of these new optimizations will likely be inappropriate for kernel
code, but I expect that some will be things that we want.

And I am not arguing against use of asms to implement the volatility
in atomic_read() and atomic_set(), and in fact it appears that one
of the architectures will be taking this approach.
Sounds like we might be in violent agreement.  ;-)
						Thanx, Paul
