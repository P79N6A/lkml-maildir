www.spamassassin.org
~/bin/Mail-SpamAssassin-2.60/sa-learn --mbox --spam ~/mail/spam
~/bin/Mail-SpamAssassin-2.60/sa-learn --mbox --spam ~/mail/spam-bad
spam-bad is differentiated because it gets >15 marks, so it gets deleted
immediatly after learning. (see the docs in the package)
but make sure to teach the baesyan about your regular email first, the
number of "ham" must be >= "spam" or your risk losing legitmate email. I
use my inbox as "ham" (that's around 10000 messages).
this is the status of my db
0.000          0        688          0  non-token data: nspam
0.000          0       9722          0  non-token data: nham
see now what it returns for these >100k viruses (Bayesian spam
probability is 99 to 100%)

or confirm that your address can receive spam.  If you wish to view
