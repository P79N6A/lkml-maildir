Please don't, there is at least one major and one minor problem to be
resolved.

First of all, EXT3_OLD_QFMT_BLOCKS is wrong.  If you "chown" a file to a
new user, you'll potentially allocate new space for a new quota file
entry.  That requires a ton of preallocation.  At the minimum, you have
the inode update; the superblock update for the free block counts; the
group descriptor update, likewise; the bitmap update; possibly one or
more indirect block updates; and (finally) the quota block itself.
You _will_ get buffer-credit assert failures with this value.
Secondly, you're now effectively calling generic_file_write with a
transaction already open.  That's _another_ lock ranking violation. 
generic_file_write() takes i_sem, and then opens a transaction.  With
this new quota code, you can now open a transaction and then take
i_sem.  Boom.  
However, most users don't ever take i_sem on the quota inode in any
other way.  Directly writing to, or truncating, the quota file is a
highly non-recommended activity. :-)
btw, I'm away all next week, so further responses will be slow...
Cheers,
 Stephen
