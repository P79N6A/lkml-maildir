It appears that you are wanting to blame all of these problems on Linux 
and refuse to accept the possibility that cdrecord/libscg is doing 
things incorrectly from a Linux perspective. If you want to "talk about 
real problems" you must accept this possibility.
Why should I have to give privileges to send SCSI commands to any device 
  in the system just to write CDs? The answer, it would appear, is that 
cdrecord is messing with things (i.e. /dev/sg interface) it has no 
business messing with in current Linux systems, since that interface 
should not be necessary for the purpose of cdrecord.
