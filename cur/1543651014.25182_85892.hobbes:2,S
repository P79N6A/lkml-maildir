  Hello,
  when tried to build UML with 2.5.45, I got into problems relatively quickly:
  # make mrproper ARCH=um
..went ok..
  # make oldconfig ARCH=um
..went ok..
  # make dep ARCH=um

  include/asm/arch doesn't exist at all (I guess that it should be symlink to
include/asm-i386/ ..?), when setting it up manually and then copying around
some missing files ("just in case it would help"), I still got burnt from
archparam.h, which wasn't found anywhere.
  Kind regards,
