Hello,
You don't show your .config, but I'll make a wild guess you're compiling for
SMP+3DNow (probably by selecting Athlon processor). If so pick one of:
	a) Deselect SMP, make clean make dep, etc.
	b) Downgrade processor selection to i686 or k6
	c) See the patch I posted here Tuesday.
Petr Vandrovec also posted a patch which takes a quite different approach.
Cheers,
Tom
