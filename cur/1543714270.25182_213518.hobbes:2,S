I see no slowdown.
But this morning (something like 8 hours ago) I could not pull from
linux.bkbits.net - it just silently exited.
When trying to access www.bkbits.net I got a full list of projects,
but when I tried to access one of the projects (when it starts using port
8080) I after a while got a message that "I had not purchased BKWeb" or
something similar. I took this as overload but now you ask I report it.
