In fact, you can do that only with fwmark.
The interface gives a 32bit counter total length, 32bit fwmark count,
the name of the interface it's coming from, the ip header, and the
data in the packet itself.
If you mark 'interesting rules' with a firewall mark, you can estimate
which rules were passed. But that's only a workaround, not a solution.
