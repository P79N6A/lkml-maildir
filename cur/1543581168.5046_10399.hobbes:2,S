Are you refering to Windows or Red Hat Linux?  I can assure you
that Red Hat Linux's XFree package doesn't have any secret code
in it with 110% certainty.  Nor will it have in the future.
Binary only modules are not acceptable in Red Hat Linux and I
will not include them in XFree86 unless forced at gunpoint.
