Subject: Vague maybe ppp-related panic report for 2.6.23-rc9

I'm running 2.6.23-rc9 on my laptop, and when in a coffee shop I use
a Verizon EVDO card to get network access.  This is a kyocera device
that looks like a serial adapter behind an ohci usb controller, and
uses the airprime driver (for usb device 0c88:17da).  The actual IP
networking is ppp over that serial adapter.
The connection is slightly flaky (I blame this on the Verizon
coverage), so I end up restarting things every so often.  The point of
this email (at last) is that I've just seen my second panic (only
info: blinking caps lock led, since I've been in X) that seems
correlated to stopping/restarting pppd.
Sorry for the lack of detail -- I've just switched to running in the
console so if I can provoke the crash again I'll get a little more
info.  I just wanted to mention this in case someone has seen
something similar or has any good ideas about how to capture debugging
output on a laptop (when I'm not home and have no other boxes handy).
