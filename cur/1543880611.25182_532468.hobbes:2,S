    I've done that and the problem is not fixed. I have to use fsck.vfat
instead.

    True, I've tested it, too. I'm going to report the problem to the
device manufacturer (it's a Cowon iAUDIO), but probably doing it in the
device will be very slow :(

    Probably, and it may be a good fix, but I seldom plug the device on
Windows.
    Thanks for the answer :)
