It does not work, that's all. Reproduce the bug and look at it for yourself.
It's still a bug, regardless of all the childish stuff you wrap around it.

It's not obscure, it's obviously broken. And it currently sucks.
I have no idea why are you repeatedly, with completely wrong arguments
trying, to explain "hotplug" stuff to me. I maintain it by the way,
and I didn't see you involved here in the last years, so I guess you
miss the background to understand the problem.
