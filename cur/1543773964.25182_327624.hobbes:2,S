I think that's a rather severe statement.   I don't see allowing user
mounts damaging standard UNIX system semantics as long as certain
rules are followed.   After all, user-mounts and private name spaces
are what the original authors of UNIX went on to develop.

I think requiring user-mounts to be in private name spaces solves many
of these issues -- you don't have to worry about system daemons and/or
other users wandering into synthetic file systems.
