On one not very scientific test: unpacking and deleting a cache hot 40MB/230MB
gzipped/unzipped tar on ext2 and xfs on a IDE drive on a lowend SMP box.
XFS (very recent 2.4.4 CVS, filesystem created with mkxfs defaults)
> time tar xzf ~ak/src.tgz 
real    1m58.125s
user    0m16.410s

real    0m50.344s
user    0m0.190s
sys     0m13.950s
ext2 (on same kernel as above)

ext2 seems to be faster and the difference on deletion is dramatic, so
at least here it looks like Alan's statement is true.
The test did not involve very large files, the biggest files in the 
tar are a few hundred K with most of them being much smaller.
The values stay similar over multiple runs.  I did not do any comparisons
recently with reiserfs, but at least in the past reiserfs usually came out
ahead of ext2 for similar tests (especially being much faster for deletion)
