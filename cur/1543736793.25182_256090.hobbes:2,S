hi,
for various reasons i am going to have to start on an fsproxy module.
if i use d_path() to get the full pathname of an inode in the fsproxy
filesystem, and then i prepend that path with the proxy prefix which
specifies the _real_ location:
how do i then turn that full pathname _back_ into a vfsmount and a
dentry?
how about.... user_path_walk() used in fs/open.c?  is that it?
*glurk*.  7 types of chaos...

around you, funnily and coincidentally enough, life gets a lot better.
