Hi,
Although I'm on vacation, I happened to download a recent copy of 
x86.git and found that it crashes early.  Here's a couple of patches to 
apply; I don't know if they apply to current git, but I hope it helps.

Subject: x86/early_ioremap: don't assume we're using swapper_pg_dir
At the early stages of boot, before the kernel pagetable has been
fully initialized, a Xen kernel will still be running off the
Xen-provided pagetables rather than swapper_pg_dir[].  Therefore,
readback cr3 to determine the base of the pagetable rather than
assuming swapper_pg_dir[].

 Subject: xen: unpin initial Xen pagetable once we're finished with it
Unpin the Xen-provided pagetable once we've finished with it, so it
doesn't cause stray references which cause later swapper_pg_dir
pagetable updates to fail.
