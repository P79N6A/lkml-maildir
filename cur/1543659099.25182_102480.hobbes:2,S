Really???
2.95 still gives me several valid warnings like e.g.:
<--  snip  -->
...
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.4/linux-2.4.20-ac/include -Wall -Ws
trict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common 
-pipe -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -march=k6   -nostdinc -iwithprefix include 
-DKBUILD_BASENAME=ircomm_tty_attach  -c -o ircomm_tty_attach.o ircomm_tty_attach.c
ircomm_tty_attach.c: In function `ircomm_tty_disconnect_indication':
ircomm_tty_attach.c:360: warning: too few arguments for format
...
<--  snip  -->
In this case the bug in your patch is pretty obvious:
-       IRDA_DEBUG(2, __FUNCTION__ "()\n");
+       IRDA_DEBUG(2, "%s()\n");
