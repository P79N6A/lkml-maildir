The Daylight-savings time changeover does not set your CMOS clock.
Sometime, before you reboot, something should do `clock -w`. I use
cron to set my system times every night to NIST.
	rdate time-a.timefreq.bldrdoc.gov
	clock -w
I do this after 4:00 AM so that if savings-time changed, I still
get the CMOS clock set right.
