Have you considered making a root cramfs?  I could almost guarantee that 
it would be smaller, not only that, but you get a gzip like compression 
for free.  Now that I have a little better picture of what you are 
trying to do, I would suggest using a read-only cramfs for your root 
file system.  You can selectively mount writeable file systems over it.
In fact, at the end of your "boot strapping process", you could 
pivot_root/chroot into a live file system on disk then drop the cramfs.  
I use this procedure on the flash of my Zaurus.  It boots a cramfs image 
from the on-board flash which then loads the SD card driver, checks some 
things out, and finally mounts and chroots into a 512MB flash card with 
a nearly stock debian image on ext2.
Actually, even debian uses this type of procedure to fsck the disks and 
look for new devices before turning control over to the disk based system.

I don't think you need to do all that I suggested earlier.  I cam in on 
the middle of this discussion and it sounded like a small embedded 
environment you were trying to enhance.  The cramfs image thing I 
described above is probably a much better fit for your needs.
