Many people have suggested/requested this and after getting 20-30 people
describing/debating how best to use procmail to filter it the issue fades
out for a month or two  until someone else requests this.
for what it's worth I always opt to use the subject tag, in part becouse I
choose not to use procmail. I am one of those strange people who dislike
having to look in many places to get current mail.
