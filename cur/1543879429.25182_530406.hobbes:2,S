The feedback was helpful in verifying whether there are any arguments against my approach. The real proof is in the pudding.
I'm running a kernel with these changes, as we speak. Overall system throughput is about up 20%. With 'system throughput' I mean measured performance of a rather large (experimental) system. The patch isn't even 24h old... Also the application latency has improved.
Additional settings: my patch is running *also* with a kernel modified to have only 8 default time slices at 250Hz setting. And no, the overall number of context switches per second hasn't blown up. The kernel was compiled with low latency and in-kernel preemption enabled, BKL preemption enabled. I haven't checked the patch stand alone yet.

So first signs are positive; note that it requires much more run time and a slew of other tests/scrutiny before we can be really sure.
W.r.t. the remarks; I am most interested in possibilities of DOS attacks that could exploit this change in sched_yield. Therefore the comments of Andi were interesting, but I haven't heard back from him yet. I'm still not sure how a task could juggle more slices from the system because of these changes.
Last remark on the O(1)'ness being violated. I think it's a mooth point. The sched_yield is executed on the CPU time of the yielder. Being O(1) is most important for the scheduler proper at each timer tick (interrupt). That being O(1) is crucial.
