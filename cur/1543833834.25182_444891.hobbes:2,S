Looking at this a bit deeper, I think the reference counting is
correct and the problem is that we are not breaking the link between
the linux inode and the xfs inode atomically w.r.t xfs_iunpin()
usage....

I don't think it fixes the problem because igrab() fails to handle
the case we are hitting where I_CLEAR is set on the inode when we
mark it dirty. There's nothing in this patch preventing us from
sleeping after the !(I_NEW|I_FREEING|I_CLEAR) check is done and then
racing with generic_drop_inode() before the igrab() can take a
reference on the inode.
ATM, I think the real problem is the use of the XFS_IRECLAIMABLE
flag and the locking involved. Nathan, the inode hash lock
is used to sync that flag between xfs_iget_core() and
xfs_finish_reclaim(), but no lock is used when setting it or
(now) checking in xfs_iunpin().....
Worse, the i_flags field does not use atomic bitops and
there is no consistent locking protecting i_flags so updates
and reads of this filed can race or even get lost....
Also, I think that xfs_iunpin() must execute atomically w.r.t
xfs_reclaim(), otherwise we cannot ever safely do the checks
we are doing in xfs_iunpin().

I think a fix is going to be much more invasive than just adding
reference as my fixes appear to have only narrowed the race window
and not solved it. The addition of the lock in the original patch
solves the atomic xfs_iunpin()/xfs_reclaim() execution problem,
but it does not solve the problems with the i_flags field. Adding
a new lock may be our only option here.
This will have to wait until after OLS before I get a chance to
look at this further...
Cheers,
Dave.
