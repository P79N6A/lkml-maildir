Hm, your report of failure on the BP6 is the first I have heard of
that.  I did (re)fix a race in a later release that may solve your
problem.
I would be very interested to see if you can replicate the problem on
2.4.12-ac5 with the corresponding preempt-kernel patch from
http://tech9.net/rml/linux
 ... I hope not.

You will need to recompile pcmcia, but then it should work.  Dave Hinds
merged specific support for detecting preempt on compile into 3.1.30 ...
but as long as the pcmcia-cs build can find your .config, with
CONFIG_PREEMPT set, you should be OK.
