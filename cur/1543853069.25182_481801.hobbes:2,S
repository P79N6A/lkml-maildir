HaHa .. sometimes it's people saying "get id of that you don't need it"
and other times it's the opposite.
Setting sbi->catatonic = 1 upon entry to autofs[4]_fill_super ensures
that autofs[4]_catatonic_mode is not called until after sbi->pipe is non
NULL. So I decided, in this case, to remove the test.
