I get the same problems: cardbus works only if I boot with the card
inserted. If I insert the card later I get two PCI device entries
for the device, and can't get any interrupts from the card (sometimes
the driver complains about the chip not responding (8139too)).
Tested with the following versions (exactly the same behaviour):
   2.5.69-bk10
   2.5.70
   2.5.70-bk2
   2.5.70-bk5
   2.5.70-bk18
   2.5.71
2.5.69-bk9 was OK.
