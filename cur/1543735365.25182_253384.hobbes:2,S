I don't think it has a chance to fix any bug, if something it will
trigger some deadlock or race condition, but OTOH I agree it should work
fine (all code I can recall by memory takes the BKL before any inner
spinlock too, and I don't think we left anything that depends on
smp_processor_id()), but again this is the kind of change that requires
some testing and cannot be shipped by default in a stable tree, it
requires config option at the very least.
