Ignoring speed issues and the fundamentally horrible interface of SysV
semaphores, there are two main issues:
1) There's a limit on the number of SysV semaphores you can have.
2) Instead of one object to deal with (ie. a memory region), you now
   have two, with different lifetimes.
Hope that clarifies,
Rusty.
