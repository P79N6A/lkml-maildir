Totally agree.  However, I wasn't restricting it to powers of two.  You
just happened to have mentioned 512 (wrt. RedHat).

512 ~= 500.  150 !~= 100.  Would someone want to use 150?  Maybe...
Anyway, it's no big deal if you prefer to leave your patch as-is. 
However, if you do, then you need to at least add a comment to the code
and modify the Configure.help to make it clear that only integer
multiples work properly.  In fact, you could just make the HZ Config
value be a "speed-up ratio" which would make various bits of the patch
cleaner.
