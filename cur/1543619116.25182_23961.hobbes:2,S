I think you can safely assume that if Al doesn't curse you to hell, he can
be considered happy.

Basically, you should always consider email to me to be a unreliable
medium, with no explicit congestion control. So think of an email like a
TCP packet, with exponential backoff - except the times are different (in
TCP, the initial timeout is three seconds, and the max timeout is 2
minutes. In "Linus-lossy-network" it makes sense to use different
default and maximum values ;)
