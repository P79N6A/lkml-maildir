Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: updating the explanation of "profile=" param
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/26/100

From: Mulyadi Santosa
Fixing "profile" kernel parameter:
- adding "kvm" parameter description
- a bit more verbose explanation of "schedule"/"sleep" param
- explicitly tells that CPU profiling is the default mode
  if none is mentioned.
Done against vanilla 2.6.23.13
