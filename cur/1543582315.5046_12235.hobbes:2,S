I remember being at a computer show in Minneapolis where a small company
was showing off this mouse that worked on a variety of surfaces without a
ball. I'm trying to remember if the mouse was optical or used yet another
method of functioning -- I think it was optical, though I could be
mistaken. This was in 1992/1993.
The point is, I really do not believe Microsoft made the "leap" to provide
opitcal mice without the need of the mousepad grid. Their "innovation" was
in marketing it on a wide scale though.
I could be mistaken - if so then let's give them their credit - but I have
a hard time believing it was their idea without some serious proof.
