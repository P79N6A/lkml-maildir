You were just lucky that the user pages were still in memory. The
problem with such code is that it seems to work throughout rigorous
testing which seems to "prove" that it's okay. It is, in fact, the
rigorous testing that keeps your pages in memory so everything seems
okay.
You need to use copy/from/to_user() so page faulting will work.
