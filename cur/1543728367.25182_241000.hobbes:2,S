Since init() is executed by a kernel_thread that does a do_fork(),
it already expects the top_cpuset to be initialized. Since this can
be achieved by initializing the task structure (INIT_TASK), I had
to move the structure definitions to the header file.
A related Q, I was wondering why the nodemask_t needed to be part 
of the task_struct, since cpuset would anyway have a reference to it. 
Sorry if this is something very obvious, I didn't really look to see 
why it was there

Yes that would be fine too.

The qualifier would still be valid I think, no ?
