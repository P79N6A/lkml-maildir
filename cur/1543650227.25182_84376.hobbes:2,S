We extended the usage of RCU to IPC_RMID, to prevent ipc_lock()
returning an invalid IPC ID which has been removed by ioc_rmid.

That's my bad, thanks for pointing this out. It's easy to fix if we
decide to go with mempool way.

Rusty's patch looks good to me. I would like to replace the mempool in
IPC with this typical RCU model. Rusty, if you like, I will make a patch
against mm6.  There need some cleanups. One thing is that ipc_alloc()
are called by other places(besides grow_ary()), and they don't need to
the RCU header structure.
