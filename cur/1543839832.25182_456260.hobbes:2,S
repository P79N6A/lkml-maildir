I agree with the above points.  Just want to add that assignment of a
task to a container may not be transparent to the application.  For
example it may hit some limits and some reclaim may happen...

I think as the tasks move around, it becomes very heavy to move all the
pages belonging to previous container to a new container.

IMO it is okay to add  the fields whenever necessary as Kirill
suggested.  I think once the container subject gets baked a little more,
the controllers will also get tightly coupled.

I'm also debating about whether printing task information is really any
useful.  If a sysadm wants to get information about any particular task
then that can come from /proc/<pid>/container  Though container list
will be one place where one can easily get the list of all the contained
tasks (and other resources like files).

Yes please.  Thanks.
