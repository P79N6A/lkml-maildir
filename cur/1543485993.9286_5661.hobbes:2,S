This sounds correct. However, the `make install` does just this on
a per-library basis, never overwriting the original. However, since
during the process, you continually create new tasks, soon new tasks
will be using binaries from an incomplete install (you can't change
ld-linux.so.x and glibc-x.so at the exact same time).
If you have different version numbers, you don't have this problem.
So. I think that `install` and `mv` has to be linked static before
such an install, perhaps even /bin/bash. There are other ways. I
could modify the make file to install everything in /new/local/lib and
/new/bin  (/new instead of /usr), then merge everything by hand.
This is a pain. I still think the solution lies with ld.so.cache. If
ld.so did not reload its cache except after an explicit command, i.e.,
`ldconfig`, and the cache pointed to already-mapped libraries, there
would not be such a problem at all. 
Cheers,
