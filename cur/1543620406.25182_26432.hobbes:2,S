static void truncate_complete_page(struct page *page)
{
        /* Leave it on the LRU if it gets converted into anonymous buffers */
        if (!page->buffers || do_flushpage(page, 0))
                lru_cache_del(page);
If the page has buffers, and do_flushpage() fails, what happens?

truncate_complete_page() can, in rare circumstances, take a page
which was in both the pagecache and on LRU, and leave it purely
on LRU.  And because that page *used* to be in pagecache, it
could be undergoing sendfile.
Or I'm missing something.  Did something change?
