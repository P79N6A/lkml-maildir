Do you mean on how similar it sounds to the famous four letter 
word that everybody seems to be afraid to say in public? :) 
Well, I had initially (and intentionally) fucvar for a conditional 
variable...however, in order to be more in order with how POSIX names
them, I changed it to fucond. 
Good thing they were not worth to implement (and actually swearing 
by them was a good thing, they were a real PITA).
Now seriously, forgive my naivete as English is my second language,
what might be not so amusing to others? the 'fuck' thingie?
Thx,
