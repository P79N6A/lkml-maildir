Yes, this is true for general use.  However, suppose I want to do an IP takeover
and send out arp packets to force an update of the arp caches of everyone on the
subnet.  The network is tightly controlled and we know everything that's on it. 
How do I guarantee that my packets get out of the local system and onto the
wire?
Currently I send three packets in a row on failover, and another three packets
every 10 seconds.  It would still be nice to be assured that the packets
actually made it onto the wire.
This is linux, we like having absolute control over our system.  Does it make
sense to have no possible way of guaranteeing that a specific packet has made it
onto the wire?
