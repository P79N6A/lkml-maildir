Subject: [PATCH] make floppy.c readable
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

run scripts/Lindent on drivers/block/floppy.c, but keep some
nicely-formatted structs (tables) and labels as they were.
Same code generated before and after, except for some __LINE__
numbers which changed as expected.
Applies to 2.6.5-mm2.
