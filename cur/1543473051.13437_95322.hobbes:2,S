Please don't continue to perpetrate this urban myth. The BSD FFS is more likely
to be corrupt than the ext2fs (note that their new journalling softupdate stuff
deals with most of the BSD ffs problems)
Standard BSD writes metadata synchronously. This means it writes the size
and block lists before the data. On a crash and fsck you get files that are
correct to fsck (the block info is right) but whose data was never written.
On Linux you may also not get the file itself if it was just created. fsck has
to be a little smarter but there is no difference on a data integrity issue.
