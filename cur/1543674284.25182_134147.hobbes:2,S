It wasn't Ingo's idea.  I suggested it.  Overloading parameter types is
evil.  This isn't an issue anymore if the extension is implemented as a
new syscall which certainly is better.

I would always use sizeof() in this situation.  alignof is a property
the compiler can potentially relax.  On x86 it could easily be defined
to 1 in case someone wants to save memory.  OK, not really useful for
x86, but some embedded archs might be in such a situation.  Using
sizeof() makes sure that the variable is always 4-byte aligned.  For
atomic operations this certainly is a good minimal requirement.
If you want to really correct you might have to introduce something like
atomic_alignof().
