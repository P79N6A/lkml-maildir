Of course not, but you cannot claim I've been harmed crossing the street
when the lights were red when I haven't.
There are dangers when mlockall() or similar and RT scheduling don't
succeed, but that doesn't mean something MUST happen. The warning IMO is
right but let's just ditch this part of the discussion.  cdrecord user
interface discussion is off-topic here.
