If you really want to do this Press release keep it simple.
And if you really wanna do it, you can put together a press
package with quotes etc. for journalists to use.
Ofcourse, IMHO, linux-kernel doesn't need to do a press release ;
a simple announcement from Linus in the usual places
will do nicely. The press will jump on it fast enough.
Instead we could focus on documenting the features of 2.2.0
and changes compared with 2.0.x 
Focus on proper technical docs, and let the press boys add
the hype words themselves.
