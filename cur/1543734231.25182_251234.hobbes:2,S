It seems to work - on UP where it is a NOP. On SMP it will deadlock.
That we have some broken code doesn't mean we want more of it :)

The "fix" is quite easy, replace all occurences of
spin_lock(&files->file_lock) in the kernel by spin_lock_bh.
But that's not going to be accepted. IIRC the SELinux guys
want to label packets with the name of the sending process,
maybe we can use this for the owner match once it's done.
