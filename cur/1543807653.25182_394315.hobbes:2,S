process groups are a completely different kind of beast.
A closer analogy are hierarchical name spaces and mounts.
If we didn't need things like waitpid outside one pid namespace
to wait for a nested namespace they would be complete disjoint
and the implementation would be trivial.

That is what checkpointing.  And that is simply the persistent form of
migration.
