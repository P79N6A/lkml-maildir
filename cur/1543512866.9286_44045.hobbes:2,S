	Hi!
	How can I translate a physical address to a virtual address?
	I have allready look to io.h phys_to_virt, but I'm not sure that is
doing the right thing - a guess it's just for io address (bellow 1Mb I
believe).
	For example, having the value of cr3 (wich gives a physical address)
how do I access the Page Directory?
	Or how can I access the local apic? (it's registers are mapped into the
memory 0xFEE00000... er... i think it's this address :).
