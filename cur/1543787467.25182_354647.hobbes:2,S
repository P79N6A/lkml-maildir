Appreciate your advice and help. I finally tracked it down to the
function called in init_module() in kernel/module.c.
/* Allow arches to frob section contents and sizes.  */
err = module_frob_arch_sections(hdr, sechdrs, secstrings, mod);
which takes most of time (more then 99%) during module loading just
as the reply from Semuel earlier.
