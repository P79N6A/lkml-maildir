I'm sorry but I cannot reproduce the phenomenon anymore. After setting
CONFIG_CPU_IDLE with "make menuconfig", when I ran "make xconfig" again
it showed the option too. Moving .config.old back to .config doesn't
make it disappear again. So it seems "make menuconfig" has elliminated
whatever caused this.
If you still want to have a look, both .config and .config.old are
available at 
http://gollum.phnxsoft.com/~ts/2.6.23-rc3-mm1/
