Hi Jörn,
sorry, I wasn't very clear.
With "loop", you're doing an ioctl() to /dev/loop<x> so that
/dev/loop<x> become a block device associated with a given file.
Applying that strictly to block2mtd wouldn't make sense.
At the moment, when you create a new block2mtd, the only thing
you see is an entry in /proc/mtd.
You don't access that mtd device directly (there's no
/dev/mtd<x>). Instead, you may access it via a /dev/mtdblock<x>
if you have "block2mtd" for instance.
Here, what you need, is an API that gets a block device (with fd
or path) and an erase size and that returns a mtd identifier.
Best regards,
Stephane
