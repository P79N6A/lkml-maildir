I opted to keep the entry but make an explicit note that ksymoops should not
be used for 2.6 kernels to make it clear. There are still people who use 
ksymoops on 2.6 Oops messages, so I thought it would make sense to keep the
entry but make it clear that you should /not/ do that.
But, I'm fine with removing it as well.

Here's a patch to remove the Ksymoops entry instead.
I'll leave it up to the powers that be to sprinkle holy penguin pee on the
preferred version.
Ksymoops should not be used on 2.6 Oops messages, so remove the ksymoops entry
