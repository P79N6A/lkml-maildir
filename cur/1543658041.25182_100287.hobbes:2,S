Seams to me like a perfectly good idea, infact I want to use that for a
game i'm developing in my free time(wheter or not i finish this, is out
of the scope of the discussion :)), once i'm done i'm going to see how
much time i spent working on this. Then i'm going figure out a time
period and ammount of money that would be *fair* conpensation. then i
plan to release under a free licence (such as the GPL, haven't put a lot
of though into that part quite yet), depending if I make the set ammount
of money first or the set time passes buy (since chance are then i won't
make my set goal :|). If people (not even me) can make money to put on a
table this way, have a decent place to live, and have health insurance
then this model can't be bad.
