Maybe you are right.
But as I said, my goal is to give us a 32-bit dev_t.
It is not necessary to eliminate register_blkdev now,
or before 2.6, in order to reach that goal.
I agree completely that it should go away, and I moved it
in front of the function it is going to be merged with.
In fact I started on the patch to remove it, but the patch
got too large. Many places do register_blkdev early and
blk_register_region later. If the region is taken already
then allocated memory must be freed etc. Trivial work,
but a largish patch. Better to divide the work in steps.
