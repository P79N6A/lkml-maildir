I'm having trouble with the getrusage syscall. It returns 0 for the memory
usage fields. Looking through the mailing list archives, there's a patch
that's supposed to solve the problem.
http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/9603.1/0217.html
Is there a technical reason why the patch wasn't incorporated in the
kernel, or did it just fall through the cracks?
