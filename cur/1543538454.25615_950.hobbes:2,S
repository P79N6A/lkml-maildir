Subject: Compiler options when building for an Avanti alpha computer

I've been trying to build the test 2.4.0 kernels for an AS400 4/233, but
it always fails when trying to mount the root file system. 
One of the oddities trying to build them has been the compiler options,
the look like this:
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/usr/src/linux/include -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2
-fomit-frame-pointer -Werror -fno-strict-aliasing -pipe -mno-fp-regs
-ffixed-8 -mcpu=ev4 -Wa,-mev6   -DEXPORT_SYMTAB -c ...
my question is about the  option, should that be -Wa,-mev64?
I'm using gcc version 2.95.2 on SuSE 6.4 beta.
