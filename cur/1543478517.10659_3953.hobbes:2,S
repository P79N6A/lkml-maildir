Great. :-)
There was a discussion about a performance-fix in fs/buffer.c:get_hash_table()
(as far as I remember) for 2.2.0pre making the locking less restrictive and
improving response time on heavy buffer chache I/O. 
I haven't followed the whole discussion. But if it really works for 2.2 it
should also do for 2.0, correct? Is there a chance of getting this into 2.0.37?
If it does make sense, and if there's a good chance _not_ to destroy the
file system, tell me, I'm gonna test it on my servers which run stable 
for ages now. :)
