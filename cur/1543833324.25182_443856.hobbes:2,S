You aren't even listening.

This has NOTHING to do with the API.
You're just in denial, and don't even listen to what people say. It also 
has nothing to do with cpufreq, which again is a case of _some_ uses may 
be patented, but not "_the_ use"
I just stated that if other interfaces don't have the problem that their 
only use is patent-protected, then other interfaces are clearly better 
alternatives. IF they have users at all.
