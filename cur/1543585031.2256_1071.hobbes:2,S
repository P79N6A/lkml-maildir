 There is a dropping point in netif_rx. The problem is that knowledge
 of congestion has to be pushed back to the devices that is causing this.
 Alexey added netdev_dropping for drivers to check. And via netdev_wakeup()
 the drivers xon_metod can be called when the backlog below a certain 
 threshold. 
 So from here the driver has do the work. Not investing any resources and
 interrupts in packets we still have to drop. This what happens at very
 high load a kind of livelock. For routers routing protocols will time
 out and we loose conetivity. But I would say its important for all apps.
 In 2.4.0-test10 Jamal added sampling of the backlog queue so device
 drivers get the current congestion level. This opens new possiblities.

 And we have done experiments with controlling interrupts and running
 the RX at "lower" priority. The idea is take RX-interrupt and immediately
 postponing the RX process to tasklet. The tasklet opens for new RX-ints.
 when its done.  This way dropping now occurs outside the box since and
 dropping becomes very undramatically.
 As little example of this. I monitored a DoS attack on Linux router
 equipped with this RX-tasklet driver.

 A bit of explanation. Above is output from tulip driver. We are forwarding
 44079 and we are dropping  49913 packets per second!  This box has 
 full BGP. The DoS attack was going on for about 30 minutes BGP survived 
 and the box was manageable. Under a heavy attack it still performs well.
 Cheers.
