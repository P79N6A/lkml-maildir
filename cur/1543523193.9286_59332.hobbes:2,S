Subject: Odd syslog entry.  Possible breakin attempt?

I'd like to know if the following is a kernel bug, possible
breakin attempt, syslog bug, or otherwise.  I'm using a stock
unmodified 2.2.13 kernel with no patches, or external binary
modules, etc...  The parts that appear suspicious to me are the
ones from "kernel: ME-enca", etc... and the hex bytes as well as
the HTML looking code.  "ME-enca" looks like part of
"MIME-encapsulated" for example, and the alt="" and </TR> below
that look odd for the kernel to be reporting.  What exactly is
this?  Someone trying to exploit my apache?
Here is the example:

Also, I've never seen the following - which are new:
Dec 28 01:17:21 asdf modprobe: can't locate module binfmt-00b0
