And what about simply having a struct io_bus containing function pointers
to read/write and ioremap routines ? This way, we could hide all the i/o
range offset issues when using several busses (we do have such problems
with the ppc, especially with IDE, see recent discussion of linuxppc-dev
mailing list). Each driver would have an bus structure associated with
the device, eventually provided by the resource tree, and the only
overhead of i/os could be the indirect function call.
For the endian issue (which I think is a non-issue) , most of the time,
the endian is known at compile time and could get be resolved by macros.
If it's not the case, then just add two sets of i/o function pointers in
the bus structure.
Also, each bus stucture (let's call this a bus driver) can have it's own
alloc/dealloc range functions associated, and eventually generic
notifiers for hotswap.
I beleive we can build some kind of "device-tree" which would be made of
a virtual root, containing busses, containing resources trees. Looks a
bit like Open Firmware ;-)
