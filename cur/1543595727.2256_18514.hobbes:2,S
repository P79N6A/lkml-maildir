Ifconfig doesn't create the new device, when the driver module is loaded
it looks for all devices on the bus and creates the table with those
entries. To locat them, an "ifconfig -a" will do

The only one I've seen are SCSI ( I believe it was done with
"echo 1 >/proc/.... ". If a new device is present (turned on) the new
entry is appended.
Another one (similar) is the parport. Loading parport_probe rescans, and
defines the new devices.
Another is a module version of IDE. unload/loading ide-probe rescans
the IDE devices.
These ARE clumsy because you have to unload them to do a rescan, also
I think the tables are contained inside the probe module. I don't think
you can unload the probe module if one of the devices is busy (though the
SCSI version might be closer to what you want, it is also the most complex).
