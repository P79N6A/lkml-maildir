Note that a lot of the software raid controllers actually have full
hardware RAID acceleration in the chipset (single block command is automatically
remapped across several drives of a RAID 0/1/10 configuration, reducing bus
transactions and bandwidth requirements.
But they still require a driver do perform the RAID management,
and are thus not true "hardware" RAID.  But they are higher on the
food chain than total "pretend" RAID devices.
