In the next few days I'll be submitting some further tty locking changes
to the kernel. Line discipline ->write and ->read methods will no longer
be covered by lock_kernel. For the moment tty->driver write methods won't
change (that is they will be either lock_kernel or in an IRQ but never
both). That is next on the hit list once the lock is driven out of the
tty ldisc layer.
If you have any out of tree ldiscs please be ready. If you maintain any
serial drivers still relying on lock_kernel for internal locking on the
read/write paths, now would be a good time to fix them before they break
