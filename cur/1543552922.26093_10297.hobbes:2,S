Yes.  I just went home, so I am emailing from my house.  I'll post late 
tonight or in the morning.  Performance on 100Mbit with NFS going 
Linux->Linux is getting better throughput than IPX NetWare Client -> 
NetWare 5.x on the same network by @ 3%.  When you start loading up a 
Linux server, it drops off sharply and NetWare keeps scaling, however, 
this does indicate that the LAN code paths are equivalent relative to 
latency vs. MSM/TSM/HSM in NetWare.  NetWare does better caching 
(but we'll fix this in Linux next).  I think the ring transitions to 
user space daemons are what are causing the scaling problems 
Linux vs. NetWare.
