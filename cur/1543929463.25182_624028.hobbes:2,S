The board manufacturer originally thought that the voltage under-
and overshot might be responsible for the system lock-ups we were
experiencing. They sent us the first plot to document the problem.
(In the end, the lock-up was linked to a bug in their DMA engine.)
I asked the system manufacturer whether they could reproduce the
voltage issue, and they sent me the second plot.

The first plot was obtained on my system. The second plot was obtained
on a different system, presumably identical to mine, but I don't know
for sure.

Errr... I need to think about it :-)

OK. I suppose I should not worry then :-)

Very much! Thanks.
