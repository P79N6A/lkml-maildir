No, they aren't.  But ifconfig and route simply can't deal with the immense
amount of network capabilities we have now.

It won't hurt much, it actually gets easier IMO :)
Instead of: ifconfig eth0 1.2.3.4 netmask 5.6.7.8 broadcast a.b.c.d ...
it becomes: ip a a 1.2.3.4/nn brd + dev eth0
The CIDR usage is great, complemented with the calculated broadcast.

I used to have reasons not to add routes and then I learned how to do it
better.  The routing really does belong there.

And a good bit of the current NET4 code is modelled after a lot of IOS.
