   Dave, "official" patch will follow later. I must think about
   some marginal effect in TCP_CLOSE_WAIT and TCP_CLOSING, which can break
   out of switch too. Duh, do specs say something about segments with seqs
   above fin? I do not remember.
A socket in a synchronized state is required to enforce legal sequence
numbers, is it not?
