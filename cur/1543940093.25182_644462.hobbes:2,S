I haven't looked, but I doubt this ended up in Andrew's tree.
Note that the Subject above says "RFC", not "PATCH".
Cliff -- could you see what of this, or the other two patches
that I sent in review of your work, made it into Andrew's tree:
  [PATCH 1/3] hotplug cpu move tasks in empty cpusets to parent node_online_map fix
  [PATCH 2/3] hotplug cpu move tasks in empty cpusets to parent various other fixes
