That did it - the CPU utilization is back down to what I
am used to seeing on 2.4. - Now, the question is - what
was more accurate?  Was 2.4 producing abnormally low
numbers?  Or 2.6 abnormally high?  One interesting thing,
just below the define statements in the file mentioned
above is a conditional define that sets HZ to 100 anyway,
if not already defined - it almost seems that the 1000
value is bogus to begin with.
Thanks again for the help - this has been quite a mystery....
Thanks,
Rett Walters
