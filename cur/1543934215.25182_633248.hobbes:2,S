That's a very good point.  So for the PIT it should be possible to have
two clocksources, one with the _p and one without, that one can switch
between with a kernel command line option.  So there shouldn't be any
slowdown at all due to that.
The i8259 init code is not time critical, so should be able to use a
"reasonable" delay.  
Besides the above there are only a handful of _p uses outside of real
ISA device drivers, and those should not be relevant for a modern PC
unless somebody wants to use an 8390 based PCMCIA card, but we could
tell them "don't do that then".
But I'd better shut up and let Alan continue on his review of the _p
use in the drivers.
