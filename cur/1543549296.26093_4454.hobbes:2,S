Current plans are to replace the current Makefile kludges with clean
code that does the same thing, gets it right where current Makefiles
are broken, is easier to maintain and (hopefully) is faster.  The
kbuild mantra is "Correctness, Maintainability, Speed", in that order.
Part of the correctness and maintainability problem is the lack of
documentation on required link orders in the existing Makefiles.
People are scared to change the order of object entries because that
defines link order and we do not know if existing orders are required
or they are just coincidence.
Once the orders are fully defined as LINK_FIRST, LINK_LAST and the
rest, then we can think about allowing make xxx_config to change the
orders.  However that would be after the Makefile rewrite had been
accepted.  It would probably require the use of CML, I don't think the
current make xxx_config language can cope with this sort of input.
