No, the regular NAPI networking core calls ->poll() as usual; no timers 
are involved. This scheme simply delays the napi_complete() from the 
driver so the device stays in the poll list longer. It means that its 
->poll() will be called when there is no work to do for 1-2 jiffies, 
hence the optimization at the top of ->poll() to efficiently handle that 
case. The device's ->poll() is called by the NAPI core until it has 
continuously done no work for 1-2 jiffies, at which point it finally 
does the netif_rx_complete() and re-enables its interrupts.
If people feel that holding the device in the poll list for 1-2 jiffies 
is too long (because there are too many wasted polls), a counter could 
be used to to delay the netif_rx_complete() by N polls instead. N would 
be a value depending on CPU speed. I use the jiffy sampling method 
because it results in some natural randomization of the actual delay 
depending on when the jiffy value was sampled in relation to the jiffy tick.
Here is the tg3 patch again that illustrates the idea. The patch changes 
only the ->poll() routine; note how the netif_rx_complete() call is delayed.
