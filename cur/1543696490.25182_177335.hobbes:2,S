Hi!
    [ I'm trying to cc: netdev - but they are not that welcome - and 
require subscription. I'm way too lazy (and my mail box is not that 
fast) to subscribe to send simple typo - if this is a case at all. ]
    [ kernel v2.6.0-test7 as found on lxr.linux.no, 2.4.{18,22} has the 
same - but line numbers are different. ]
    On line 1057 we have: "msg->msg_flags|=MSG_TRUNC;" to indicate that 
message was truncated.
    But on line 1073, where we make return status to user, we check 
against user suplied flags, but NOT msg->msg_flags.
    It looks like obvious typo.
