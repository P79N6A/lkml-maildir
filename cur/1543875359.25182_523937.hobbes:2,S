OK thanks, then it's something else.
I see only one more thing that might make any difference:
Perhaps we are not seeing the problematic operation due to the different 
loglevel?
Please change in the third printk() the patch adds the KERN_INFO to 
KERN_WARNING.
If you get a "...trying to change BAR..." before it hangs, remove the 
pci_write_config_dword() line - this should then fix it.
