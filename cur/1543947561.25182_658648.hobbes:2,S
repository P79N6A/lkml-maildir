While we're talking about checkpatch.pl, I'd definitely like to teach 
checkpatch about "list_for_each" and friends.
list_for_each is flow control, not a function call.  I find it much 
easier to see that something is a loop when there is a space between the 
name and the parenthesis rather than when they are smashed together.
old patch follows
   /Christer
checkpatch complains about the following:
WARNING: no space between function name and open parenthesis '('
#520: FILE: drivers/spi/spi_s3c24xx_dma.c:478:
+       list_for_each_entry (transfer, &message->transfers, transfer_list) {
which I think is a bit bogus since it actually is a for statement in
disguise.  The following patch adds list_for_each to the list of things
that look like functions that it shouldn't complain about.
