I am working on a project which will require a lot of CPU power.  I will
be running TCP, a managable number of busy threads, and gigabit ether.
I was curious how good the alpha processor support is in Linux as
compared to, say, i386.  Also How well do alpha processors scale up on
Linux 2.4 in a veriety of different n-way alpha boxes.
TIA,
Bart.
