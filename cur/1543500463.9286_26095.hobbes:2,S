First thing to do is restructure your hardware layout.
Second is get the latest back code patch for 2.3.x to 2.2.x.
Move thae drives to this location only after to stub out you append of all
the ide-scsi calls.  Remove the one for your tape and cd also; however,
the cd-r may still require this parameter.
Recompile kernel and enable offboard option.
Make a bzdisk for general precautions, also.
Promise Ultra33 
ide0/hda == hda: Maxtor 8.4 GB UltraATA/DMA drive (purchased August 1998)
ide1/hdc == hde: MAxtor 8.4 GB UltraATA/DMA drive (purchased January 1999)
PIIX4
ide2/hde == hdd: Sony CDU-928E CD-R
ide2/hdf == ??? ide-floppy??
ide3/hdg == hdb: Panasonic 24x CD-ROM (same purchase time
ide3/hdh == hdc: Seagate Travan tape drive (STT-8000A, I believe)
You will need to call "pci=reverse" to invert the pci-device scan order.
Promise card needs to be in the highest PCI slot.
Disable the PIIX4 in the beginning to allow the mainboard to boot off the
Ultra33.  Once you get a boot with Promise hard-disk with hda/hdc, call
the pci=reverse via lilo+append line. Reboot and the IDE scan order will
list in reverse like this ::
PDC20246: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev a0
PDC20246: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20246: ROM enabled at 0xfebe0000

hdf: The drive reports both 100663296 and 0 bytes as its capacity
Will answer more questions if you consider this option.
