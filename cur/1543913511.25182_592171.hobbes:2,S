I know that it's difficult to get people to read docs & help text,
and maybe it is needed in more places, but CONFIG_ATA (SATA/PATA)
help text says:
  NOTE: ATA enables basic SCSI support; *however*,
  'SCSI disk support', 'SCSI tape support', or
  'SCSI CDROM support' may also be needed,
  depending on your hardware configuration.
A popup makes some sense, but I don't know if menuconfig knows how to
do popup warnings... and it needs to be done for all *configs,
not just menuconfig.
