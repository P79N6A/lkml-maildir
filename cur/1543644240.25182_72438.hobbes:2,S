One solution would be to replace the idtag hash with an idtag tree.
Then get_pid_list() could return an array of sorted pids, and finding 
the next pid after unlocking the task_lock would be just a tree lookup 
(find first pid larger than x).
And a sorted tree would make it possible find the next safe range for 
get_pid() with O(N) instead of O(N^2).
