I second that emotion.  Let's not lose track, though, of how the 
BitKeeper issue affects kernel development.  Giving the BitKeeper 
discussions their own home
achieves 2 things: keeps the kernel development list focused on kernel 
development and gets the BitKeeper issues hashed out better by making 
those its own separate forum.
