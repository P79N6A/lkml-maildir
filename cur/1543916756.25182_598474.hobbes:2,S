ccwgroup is a bit special. The ccwgroup drivers (say, qeth) will
unregister their ccwgroup_driver in their exit function. ccwgroup will
then unregister all devices bound to this driver (a ccwgroup device
without a driver does not make sense, since they are artifically
created by writing to a 'group' attribute provided by the driver). This
makes sure that ccwgroup cannot be unloaded while there are still
devices on the bus, so your example won't hit.

There are already problems like this with ->release().
