I had Communicator 4.5 (US) crashing instantly on a number of pages that I
really wanted to see.  I had Java and Javascript on.  I also have the JDK
1.5 installed and CLASSPATH was set. I finally stabilized Communicator by
wrapping it with a script containing a carefully-constructed custom
CLASSPATH:
	export CLASSPATH=$(echo $MOZILLA_HOME/java/classes/*.jar | tr " "
":"):$CLASSPATH:$JAVA_HOME/lib
Any deviation from this "unfixes" the problem.  ???

Innovation is only valuable if it improves one's life; otherwise it's
just one more silly change to cope with.
