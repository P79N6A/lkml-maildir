Ah, ok, it was mentioned to me there was a maintainer for tmpfs, but I
found no mention of you in the tmpfs source, or MAINTAINERS. Maybe
submit a patch ;-).

Yes, I'd agree that replacing CURRENT_TIME in filesystems with
current_fs_time should be worthwhile for all filesystems - That,
combined with your patch below to ensure they all use s_time_gran,
should ensure safety.
A total removal of CURRENT_TIME wouldn't work, there are a few other
users besides setting [acm]times - however as above, we should be able
to kill it for all filesystems.
However CURRENT_TIME_SEC looks safe to convert, all of it's users are
filesystems.

I checked at well, and this does cover every filesystem I see in the
mainline.

I'd appreciate it tmpfs either of the fixes actually making it to
2.6.17, there are a reasonable number of Gentoo users that use tmpfs as
temporary storage to compile stuff, and there's a long-standing argument
that tmpfs wasn't safe for that, due to this bug ;-).
