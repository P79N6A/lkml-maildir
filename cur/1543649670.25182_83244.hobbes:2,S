   Mh. Since bridging firewall is cool, but not something everybody will
   use by default [and it adds code as well as enlarges the skb], I think it 
   should be a compiletime kernel config option.
This was my initial reaction, but both of us misunderstand what
is going on I think.
If you use bridging, using netfilter on the bridged traffic "is not
possible" without these bridge-netfilter changes.
So he's saying, if we have bridging enable and netfilter, should
bridge-netfilter be on, and right now I say yes.
Bart, correct me if I'm wrong.
