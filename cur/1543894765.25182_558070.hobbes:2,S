I will try to compile X in debug mode, so I will have more info while debug.
(how I read in 
http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/ServerDebugging
)
I have this problem only with a pc in others pc i haven't this problem,
but windows don't crash, so I guess that isn't a bad hardware problem.

I tried only 1 hardware configuration, trying several software configuration
others people have my problem with different hardware configuration
I have read many forums related to the problem
(such as 
http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-198023-postdays-0-postorder-asc-highlight-lockups-start-0.html
)
I have this problem since years such as many others people in the world 
(reading in internet)
