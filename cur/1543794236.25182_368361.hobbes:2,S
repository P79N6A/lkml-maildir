Now, a requirement came up which needs all those messages thrown to STDOUT also to be logged in a LOGFILE (in addition to STDOUT). Yes, this can be done through tee...but the usage model of the compiler doesn't leave that possibility open for me.

Replace all printf's with a MACRO that expands to two different printf's
one to stdout and one to a log.  Not pretty though I suppose.
Or you make your own function to replace all printf's with that does the
output and any logging you want done.
