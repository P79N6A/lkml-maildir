First, thanks for your help!
Surely it is better not to have a capital letter. My idea to have that 'bz2'
in the name was that you could also have some more kernel compression
algorithms some day. For all of these you would need new names. To make it
at least a little bit easier there should be that 'bz2' in the name. So
'bz2linux' would be a goal. But if we do this we also could change 'bzImage'
to 'gzlinux'.
On the other hand I also had the idea to let the name 'bzImage' be for both,
gzip and bzip2. The problem is that I can neither overload the name nor
choose the kernel compression at configuration time [I do not know how to
make it at least].
Have fun.
