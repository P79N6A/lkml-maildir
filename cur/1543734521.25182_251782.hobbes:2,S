We could do, or the DRM driver could provide DMA methods for the
framebuffer driver to use. I mean it might be that we should always be
using DMA methods in all the drivers for radeon all the time anyway  ?
The fb driver gets told when DRI comes and goes which means the two can
choose to co-operate if they wish.
