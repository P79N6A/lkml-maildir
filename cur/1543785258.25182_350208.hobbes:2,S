Not really. The load of the machine doesn't get that high as normal.
On machines that feed usenet to us (usenet ==push system) i see that we
grow "backlog" (we're not accepting usenet as fast as we should).

Now that you mention it, i saw this in the log file when running the SMP
kernel:
newsgate kernel: mv[7024]: segfault at 00002aaaaabc3648 rip 00002aaaaaaac80e 
 rsp 00007fffffdc17c0 error 4
It was only a oneliner, no further details.

What i  did try is the following (prior on other SMP kernels)
I tried binding certain processes to a certain cpu.
Did the same for the irq's.
Just to see if it mattered.
It didn't...

I know, that's why a plee for help is _my_ only resort ;-)
I do understand that at this level most people send in patches.
Thanks for your reply!
Will try the "echo 0" next time i boot a smp kernel.
