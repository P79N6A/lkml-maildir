Well, I'm rethinking my opinion of not wanting two accounting methods in 
the kernel. Make them share as much code as possible, with the only
remaining difference being the format of the record and wether it is 
written per process or per job. Then we just have to make sure that both
mechanisms get exercised regulary, to prevent bit-rot.

Yes, it would probably be easier if the kernel knows about the job and 
could stuff a job ID into the acct record. If that means going from 64 
byte records to 128 bytes, this would again double the already larger 
overhead of BSD accounting, however. This lightweightness of CSA is why I 
am not opposed to its inclusion.
On the other hand, there are a few uses (and users) of per-process
accounting records, i.e. for security auditing, so we should not back
it out of the kernel.

BSD accounting doesn't have the concept of a job at all. When we discussed 
the v3 format, we considered adding a job ID field from PAGG, but a) 
nobody answered and b) there wasn't any space left in the record anyways.
So a decision was postponed for a future 128 byte acct v4 structure.

My proposed solution for a userspace method would also be inescapable:
To start a new job, just write out it's pid to a file that is only ever 
appended to, and consider all children of it as belonging to the same job.
Inescapeable, but probably some overhead in userspace.
Oh, wait - I think there is a problem in current BSD accounting, if the 
parent process dies before the child, and the child gets reparented to 
init. I should investigate that...

Yes, it's probably a lot easier if you don't have to search accounting
files to do that.
So from my view, we might turn the discussion from whether we want CSA to 
how we integrate it, i.e. do some code review.
