No. Alpha (and apparently sparc) simply do not save the registers that the
signal handling wants on the stack _at_all_. There are too many registers 
to save at each system call entry point, and 99% of all system calls never 
need it.
The system call return that checks for signals anyway will end up saving a
special stack frame when needed. As will the special signal-related system
calls (sigsuspend() and friends). All of this is not only architecture-
dependent, it is literally coded in assembly language for the
architectures.  See "do_switch_stack()" for alpha.
Anyway, if you wondered why Linux beats every other Unix out there on 
system call overhead, now you know.  And yes, this is important.
