Subject: [PATCH] Fix x86_64 boot/memory.c compilation (a misprint)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/5/21/92

There is a misprint in arch/i386/boot/memory.c file that leads
to error in x86_64 compilation:
...
  CC      arch/x86_64/boot/memory.o
arch/i386/boot/memory.c: In function `detect_memory':
arch/i386/boot/memory.c:32: error: can't find a register in class `DREG' while reloading `asm'
The err variable is specified in asm output list like "=dm", not "=m".
This is for 2.6.22-rc1-mm1 tree. Maybe this exists in i386 as well 
and the patch is sent, but...
