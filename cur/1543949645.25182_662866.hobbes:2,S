Well the guarantee can only be exploited if you would check the cacheline 
sizes and the object size from the code that creates the slab cache. 
Basically you would have to guestimate what the slab allocator is doing.
So the guarantee is basically meaningless. If the object is larger than a 
cacheline then this will never work.
