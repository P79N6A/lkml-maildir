I suppose what I'm *really* asking is what the basis is for assuming that this *isn't* a kernel
bug and can therefore be safely ignored, seeing as the oops is real, the hardware is fine and the
kernel is untainted? That seems to cover the bases from where I'm sitting.
Cheers,

P.S. No micro-heatwaves have occurred here, either. Do we all need to install muon detectors in
our homes before reporting bugs now, so that we can exclude cosmic ray events too?
