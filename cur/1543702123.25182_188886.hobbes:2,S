| "unmount: / device is busy".

| An IDE CD-ROM works fine so it should be related to the SCSI driver.

Yes, this has been reported several times.
Ah, patch that should fix it was merged on Dec. 20.  See
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=bk-commits-head&m=107283358922205&w=2
or
http://linus.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.1474.36.5?nav=index.html
|ChangeSet@-3w
so it should be fixed in 2.6.1-rc1.
