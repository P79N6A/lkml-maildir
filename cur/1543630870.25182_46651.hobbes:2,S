Funny you should mention that, since Bitkeeper has embarrassed itself pretty
badly with respect to patches, so far.
  - Somebody decided to add another level on top of the linux root directory
    in their source directory.  I can't import patches into that.
  - I can apply patches to bitkeeper repository using the normal 'patch',
    but Bitkeeper gets its revenge later, as each bk edit command starts
    off by throwing away the patch.
Given the hype, I expected more.  I want a tool to save work for me, not
create new work.  I don't think I'll be using Bitkeeper as a substitute for
patch any time soon.
