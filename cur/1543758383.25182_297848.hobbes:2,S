The 2.4 fix was for fb_find_mode to always return 640x480 if modular.
There's no fix yet for 2.6 except for the patch which is already in the mm
tree, which is for fb_find_mode() to always fail if driver is compiled as a
module. (patch below).
Both fixes will still crash if fb_find_mode() is called again, so this
function is really designed to be called only once.
As for the other patch that removes the __init from modedb, some of the
developers might disagree. 
Olaf,
Can you send me your EDID block?  You can use read-edid.  Your monitor
may have a fixable EDID and can be a candidate for the broken display
database.
