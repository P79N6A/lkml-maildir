The original plan behind that option was to find hardware faults early,
but it seems to trigger a lot of false positives for various reasons.
Part of this problem is that MCEs can also be generated on some hardware
by doing something silly like reading from a reserved part of your
motherboard chipset..
There are also CPU errata that can cause them to falsely trigger in
some unusual cases, but I've not had time to go through the various
errata datasheets to blacklist affected CPUs unfortunatly.
I'm toying with the idea of marking it CONFIG_BROKEN for 2.6,
and fixing it up later.
