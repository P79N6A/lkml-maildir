For 2.5 I have something like this in mind: 
(this is a first draft of what I think we need)
Every "driver" specifies the following information:
* the CONFIG_variable
* the Question
* the long description 
* the menu location
* the type (bool tristate Hex String etc)
Optional:
* Which architectures
* Safe/Sane answer (ie default answer)
* URL to the project homepage
* "Requires": dependencies on other questions/options
* Suggests: related, suggested questions/options
* Conflicts: conflicting options
* AskWhen CONFIG_XXX: Only ask when CONFIG_XXX is set (for example, only ask
       the IRQ when the card itself is selected)
* "Makefile": lines to add to the Makefile when this driver is selected
* Minversion/Maxversion: minimum/maximum version of the kernel the driver
            works with
This is a lot of information, and perhaps it should be stored in XML or a
similar format. This information allows for:  [aka the requirements] 
1) full dependency checking
2) display not-yet valid questions (for forward-dependencies etc) while
    hiding irrelevant questions (IRQ values etc)
3) a simple untar of a driver into drivers/3rdparty is enough to compile the
   driver as a module or into the kernel
This is perhaps overkill (I fear so), but I doubt the current Config.in
system is flexible enough to allow the 3rd requirement to just untar and
work.
