I think there a large number of embedded systems developers who would
disagree with you about the seriousness of their needs. Both memory
conservation and realtime guarantees are extremely important; the memory
requirements will define a fixed cost of their device (if it's be
targetted for mass production), and lowering that is a serious goal.
Remember, we still have /dev/kmem, which serves the need for access to
all the same information, and does so in a much lighter-weight manner,
much more suitable for low-memory and embedded systems.

This has so many problems, I don't even know where to begin.
Enforcing that /proc be mounted in a particular position at boot time has
a number of side effects:
- policy: the kernel is enforcing policy on userspace, in a manner it
  currently doesn't do (and doesn't need to). Why force this naming
  convention and placement on people?
- security: /proc reveals an incredible amount of information about a
  system. Not everyone is as comfortable as you providing that data to
  all users, and as there is no pressing need in most cases to mount that
  in a publically-accessable location, why force it on people?
I could keep going, but I'm short on time, and I'm sure someone else will
expound on this too.
