x86info with no arguments will tell you what it thinks the CPU is
(it does MP/XP discrimination), and what the CPU reports itself as
(The processor name string)
x86info -f will tell you the CPU capability flags lines,
which should show an 'mp' bit on MP CPUs.
Note btw, grab v1.9. 1.8 had a stupid bug which broke AMD recognition.
I only just uploaded it so you may have to wait 30 mins for the
mirror script to kick in.
