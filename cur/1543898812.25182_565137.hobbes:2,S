And these problems will generally be difficult to reproduce reliably and debug.

That's correct.

I think the only thing that can deadlock in that context is the sync.  At
least, I don't see anything else.

Not that I know of.  It may affect user space drivers, but there's no data on
that.

The problem is that when the freezer was designed (I didn't do that, BTW),
there was no FUSE and similar things, so it's not prepared to cope with
such interdependencies between user space tasks.
We had an analogous problem with vfork() and it was solved by using the
PF_FREEZER_SKIP flag.  Perhaps we can do similar thing with FUSE.
