One problem is that I've never heard of it and don't know where to get

I did, back in the archives.  I don't have easy access to archives etc,

Well, reboots are the problem over possible oopses (or data corruption,
even more fun.)  But on your recommendation I'll give Martin's mod a
try, given a URL.  Does Martin's patch play well with -aa?  How about
Martin+10_vm in -pre2? ;-)
At any rate, right now there are three or four people with different VM
patch sets, probably more.  There is a certain amount of work this group
can do in judging which concepts are cleaner or most suitable to 2.4.x.
It would be cool to give rmap a try, but I don't want to maintain a
2.4.x kernel with speculative features that aren't intented for 2.4.x.
I can see using patches back-ported from 2.5, but I'm a firm believer
that 2.4 should stay stable and that the benefit of 2.4 to admins is the
control by the maintainer and stability -- not the VM of the month.
I can test, but it's slow going with so many patches.  And many of the
patches haven't been properly merged with any kernel (e.g., -aa 10_vm
reverting previously applied 2.4 changes, etc.)
While I've reproduced the issues and explained them here in the past,
it's difficult for me to iterate fast enough in an environment that
easily reproduces tha problem.  I'm iterating as fast as I can, but when
I do iterate I'd prefer some support from the maintainers or other parts
of the community that "Yes, this patch has a good chance of fixing the
specific problems we've been seeing, give it a try."  Right now that
doesn't exist (with the exception of your recommendation of this Martin
patch), and that's one reason I'm hesitant to iterate too much and
effect a lot of people.
Thanks,
