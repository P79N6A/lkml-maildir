After thinking about this, I have the opinion that if an RSS limit is 
working it would be a hard limit. The alternative is a process which 
gets large and then when memory pressure increases the oversize process 
either causes a lot of swapping or worse yet ties up a lot of memory if 
swap rate is limited.
There are many ways to tune Linux badly, adding one more will not add 
much to the pain if the default is off. The values available to a normal 
users might be limited to prevent the most obvious bad choices. Or a 
corresponding option could be provided to take corrective action for a 
process with RSS set (to any value) and swap rate high.
