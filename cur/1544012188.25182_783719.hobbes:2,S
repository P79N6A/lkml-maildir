Yeah, I suppose I just edited the patch to
delete segments that *did* get merged.  It
looks like that change to <linux/gpio.h> got
included, and "patch" didn't complain ...
leaving the puzzle of just why the *rest* of
that pre-2.6.27 build fix still hasn't merged.
A double inclusion is a minor-but-harmless
annoyance.  Those <asm/arch/...> ==> <mach/...>
header changes were mostly merged by 2.6.27-rc2,
but ones for this particular file got stripped
out.  More than a small bit puzzling; I can
understand patches getting dropped or lost,
but not getting mangled like that.
When I verify that I have a kernel booting
on the DM6446 EVM in mainline, I'll resend
both of the patches.  They are IMO overdue
to merge.
