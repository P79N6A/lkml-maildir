I like it when I get the same IP back and can continue an ssh session.
My line drops regularly in mid session.
Unfortunately getting the same IP is rare now, so I've been toying with
running a PPP tunnel through a fixed host out on the net.  The tunnel
would be dropped and recreated with each new connection.  My local link
IP would change, but the tunnel IP would not so connections to other
places, ssh etc. would all be from the tunnel IP.
The important thing is that the tunnel is destroyed and recreated (it
has to be, it is over different underlying link addresses).  I do not
want that to destroy the connections from the tunnelled address.
