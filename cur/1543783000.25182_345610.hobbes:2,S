These days Slackware has /etc/rc.d/rc.sysvinit to run SystemV style
init scripts in addition to its own BSD init scripts. So as long as
the script is well written (takes start/stop arguments) and is placed
in /etc/rc.d/rc${runlevel}.d/ as both K* and S*, then all a slackware
user needs to do to run it at boot is to  chmod +x
/etc/rc.d/rc.sysvinit  if they haven't already.
