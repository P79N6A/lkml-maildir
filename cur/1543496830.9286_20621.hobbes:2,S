Odd.
I would expect != to generate better code than ^: != uses `cmp'
instruction, ^ uses `xor' unless the compiler gets clever.
Since `cmp' does not clobber a useful value but `xor' does, and the
`cond1 && cond2 && cond3' sequence has to be a sequence of test, branch,
test, branch etc., I'd expect != to use fewer instructions overall than ^.
Are you thinking of the sequence `if ((a ^ b) | (c ^ d))' etc. instead?
That might be marginally smaller and faster with xor because branches
are optimised away.  But I wouldn't expect such speed from `if ((a ^ b)
&& (c ^ d))'.
-- Jamie
 because the latter
clobbers a value which must be clobbered
I would imagine `if ((a ^ b) && (c ^ d))' to generate code like this:
    xorl %eax,%ebx   # must copy %ebx if required later
    jz   0f
    xorl %ecx,%edx
    jz   0f
    # body of if
0:
And `if ((a != b) && (c != d))' to generate code like this:
    cmpl %eax,%ebx
