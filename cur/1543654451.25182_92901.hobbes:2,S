Two questions:
- I am trying to use gcc's __builtin_prefetch, and it is able to
  spit different prefetch instructions depending on 'temporal
  locality' of the data:
	prefetchnta, prefetcht2, prefetcht1, prefetcht0
temp-loc:    0           1         2           3
  0 means you can just discard after r or w, and 3 means you
  are really interested in data lasting in cache.
  Do not know if the use of prefetch in kernel is extensive,
  but perhaps this is something to investigate...
- PII also supports the prefetches. Is it worth to add it ?
TIA
