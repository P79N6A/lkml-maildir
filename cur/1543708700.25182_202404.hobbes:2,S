yitch.  I realise this is called rarely, for realtively small numbers of N
(which gets squared), but.
This allocate-me-the-lowest-available-number is a common idiom in the
kernel and we really should do it better.  Seems we need to convert the
dynamic pty allocation to do it as well - it has yet another open-coded
ad-hoc allocator.
The lib/idr.c code is a bit clumsy but it does do the job relatively
efficiently.  If it needs some helper wrappers or API simplification then
let's add those.
