| Hi Randy,
|
| Yes, the code fragment in a) above is how the timer code shares the
| APIC timer interrupt.  There is an in-kernel "Posix style" timer
| which is used to generate the profile tick.  This still needs
| a bit of work to allow the profile tick rate to be set.  It defaults
| to HZ.  In the long run, it might make sense to call the profiling
| code from the "case TICK" in check_expiry() perhaps generalizing the interface
| so that it would call through a function pointer.  There are a few
| bits of code that would benifit from having in-kernel repeating timers.
| An example would be the code which syncs the hardware clock every 18 minutes.
|
| Yes, the id allocator uses a recursive approach.  This has been discussed
| before. It is well bounded, has a tiny stack frame and will never
| require more than 6 levels of nesting.  I have been following the changes
| George has made to his version.  This "simple problem" is a real time sink.
Ah, I think I recall akpm commenting on that.
Yes, I noticed it is a small stack requirement, and being so bounded
doesn't seem like a problem to me.
Thanks,
