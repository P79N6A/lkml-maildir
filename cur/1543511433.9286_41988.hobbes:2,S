In case anyone  has the same long experience that I did, always remember
to: Check all the motherboard jumper settings carefully yourself.
I bought an FIC VA503+ with an AMD-K6/2-300, and had problems getting the
machine to boot.  Sometimes it would hang, and sometimes it would give a
kernel panic.  After sending it back and having the reseller fix it, I
finally got around to re-trying it.  Same problems, and I swapped memory,
cards, drives and power supplies. Since the machine booted up with the
nameless Gates product, I figured I had a bad set of drivers, an tried a
few different kernels until I got one with a VIA 82586 in it, but still
had the same problems.  After 5 months of mailing, compiling kernels,
swapping parts, cutting my fingers on the case a few times, and cursing
the distributions I was using, I checked the core voltage for the chip.  
It was set to 2.8 volts instead of 2.2.  Now it works beautifully.  
Looking back, it was crashing partway through the parallel fsck-ing of the
hard drives, probably during a lot more IO than the Windows applied.
I'm glad it works now, but could kick myself for how much time this silly
problem cost me.  
If at first you don't succeed, RTFM.
Dave.
