Interestingly, bisection firmly blames this patch and QEMU boots with the two
patches reverted but fails with them applied so that patch does cause problems.
The failure on the laptop must be depending on some follow-on patch. I tried
a hatchet-job revert of the IDE patches between IDE-START and IDE-END in
the series file and it similarly fails to probe the IDE devices. So either
I made a mess of the reverts (strong possibility) or there is more than one
problem patch.
