This looks interesting.

Probably the best long term solution is to make the protocol choice
be a property of the destination cache.

The protocol choices are mutually exclusive, if you walk through the code
(or do experiments), you find that that only one gets used.  As part of the
longer term plan, I would like to:
	- have one sysctl
	- choice by route and destination
	- union for fields in control block
Is there interest in setting up a semi official "-tcp" tree to hold these?
because it might not be of wide interest or stability to be ready for mainline
kernel.
