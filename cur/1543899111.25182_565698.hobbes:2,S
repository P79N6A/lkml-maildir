This is why I think the whole concept of filesystems in userspace is broken. 
Trying to shift things that need special privilege and special handling to 
userspace is just asking for trouble. You can say it's the kernel code's 
fault, but then you have to explain why it's only fuse (yeah ok, and XFS) 
that have problems.
