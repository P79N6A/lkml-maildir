Stupid question, I have forgotten the details of ioctl: Wouldn't the
following work?
struct ff_effect {
        __u16 type;
        __s16 id;
        __u16 direction;
        struct ff_trigger trigger;
        struct ff_replay replay;
        union {
                struct ff_constant_effect constant;
                struct ff_ramp_effect ramp;
                struct ff_periodic_effect periodic;
                struct ff_condition_effect condition[2]; /* One for each axis */
                struct ff_rumble_effect rumble;
        } u;
        /* New member: Specify a plane in the 3d space. */
        struct ff_plane plane;
};
Would that pose compatibility issues? If the input layer knows the
size of the struct the user-space application is sending, it knows if
it's safe to look into the "plane" member. If it is, and the device
driver is capable of handling 3d effects, then fine. If it is but the
device driver can't handle it, return an error code. If it isn't, just
do whatever it's currently doing.
Alternatively, one could leave ff_effect effect untouched and find
another way to specify the plane, e.g. another ioctl.
