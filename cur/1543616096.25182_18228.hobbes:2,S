I sent a patch to unusual_devs.h but didn't get any response yet.
I need to set "CONFIG_SCSI_MULTI_LUN=y" and use the second device for 
CompactFlash.
No other needed change here:
UNUSUAL_DEV(  0x04ce, 0x0002, 0x0074, 0x0074,
                "ScanLogic",
                "SL11R-IDE",
                US_SC_SCSI, US_PR_BULK, NULL,
                US_FL_FIX_INQUIRY),
