this is something i haven't mentioned. when running in RT mode, jackd
also runs a higher prio RT thread called the watchdog. it wakes every
5 seconds to check that the "main" thread is not stalled (i.e. a
client that is stuck in a loop) and kills everything if it
is. however, this thread's loop is incredibly simple (it checks and
resets a single int variable and goes back to sleep) that causing a
700usec delay would itself seem to me to be indicative of a
problem. do you agree?
