Wow! Unexpected, to say the least. First time I see such a behavior.
Could it be that your CPU fan isn't a simple passive device but one of
these high-tech models with an embedded thermal sensor and automatic
speed adjustment? This would possibly interact with the motherboard PWM
capability and could explain the strange speed curve your obtained.
I would also like you to try a similar test with your case fan. Enable
"smart guardian" mode for this one (by writing 0x73 to register 0x13),
then scan the 0x7f-0x00 range (register 0x16) like you did for your CPU
fan. I wonder if you will obtain the same kind of result or a standard
linear curve.
(Note that PWM2 might not be wired at all on your motherboard, so don't
be surprised if the case fan speed doesn't change at all.)
Thanks,
