Those are the ones I was thinking of, yes.  I need to make time to
look at those (even try them out!) but I don't have it just now.
Though I did notice you were using microframe "7" as an error code;
best to have some #defined constant, and one that would later allow
for use of FSTN nodes in the periodic schedule.
If other folk sent testing reports in, that'd help.  It'd affect
full speed devices down-stream of high speed hubs, when they use
isochronous transfers (audio, video) or interrupt ones (mostly
hubs and input devices like keyboards, mice, tablets).  And the
test cases of most interest would include several of those being
used at the same time ...

I'll likely OK that for merge into 2.6.16 without the Kconfig option.
Just replace the old scheduling with the newer stuff; no point in
trying to sort out two different sets of hard-to-track lowlevel bugs.
