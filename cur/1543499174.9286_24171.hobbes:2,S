Perhaps (don't have /proc/mtrr on any of my systems, so I don't know it
that well). In general, I don't think it's a good idea to try to pull
many things over from /proc into /dev, because a) people (and their
programs) expect to find them in /proc, and b) many items in /proc are
more like a text file than a device file in actual usage and in usage
policy. The distinction isn't perfect right now, but shuffling things
around won't make it better.

Perhaps even /dev/ide/bus0/master (but, as I said, that may be too much
purism - even Solaris doesn't quite go that far)

Yes.

If you wish ... I've used the order in which you'd issue chowns/chmods.

Well, as far as I can tell, you happen to have some persistence hacks ;-)
What I'm suggesting is to get rid of them plus the underlying problem
(i.e. direct chmod/chown in /dev).

I mean "user" as in "user-space", which includes root.

Sure, but I think most of the critics have a problem with the core
functionality, not the potential for doing other neat things, so in
a way, this isn't relevant. Once the core bits are in you can quietly
exploit the rest ;-)
