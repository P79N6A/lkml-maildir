Erm, you haven't told me yet why it's a bad idea. You just said "don't do 
it", but I haven't seen the reason for it. There doesn't seem to be any 
documentation on how to properly use cdev besides the Kernel Device Drivers 
book, which (if memory serves) doesn't mention anything on this topic.
I really don't mind implementing refcounting in the v4l framework, I just 
want to understand why it should be done like that!
It seems to me that I will just be shadowing the refcounting of cdev if I 
implement refcounting in v4l: init to 1 on creation, increase on open, 
decrease on close, decrease on deletion. It's all terribly familiar...

Sure, here it is:

This solves this particular problem. But this will certainly break v4l as it 
is right now, since the spin_lock means that the kref's release cannot do 
any sleeps, which is possible in v4l. If we want to allow that in cdev, 
then the spinlock has to be replaced by a mutex. But I have the strong 
feeling that that's not going to happen :-)
