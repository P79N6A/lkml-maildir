I've disabled IDE support in the config and recompiled the kernel.
It seems you are right, problem go away, new kernel was booted without any
problems and works well.

I'm very happy that we have found the cause of this issue, however it seems for
me you do not understand fully its severity for linux end-users.
At the present moment this issue is present in all vendor kernels, and they
cannot be installed on the huge number of end-user nodes. Moreover, end-user
nodes can have installed old Linux distribution where initscripts do not loads
all the detected modules at the boot-time. Linux may be installed  and the
following situation is possible: kernel was booted and works well until some
user will going to access the CDROM.
From end-users point of view this issue looks mystic and very dump: is the linux
stable? is it ready for desktop? $%^&#! It crashes when I accessing the CDROM! :(
As a linux support engeneer I've seen this issue several times on the user-nodes
and it was very hard to understand what's happened and how to prevent this issue
in the future. First question is resolved now but from support point of view it
is very important to find some workaround against this issue on existing
distributions. Right now I see only one way: if this issue is detected on the
user node, we can add something like "ide=disable" into kernel commandline.
Probably the better solution exists?
thank you,
