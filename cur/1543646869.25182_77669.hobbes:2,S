Regarding this, has anyone been thinking of splitting printk into a
bunch of macros such as:
#ifndef CONFIG_TINY
#define printk_debug(xxx...) printk(KERN_DEBUG, xxx...)
#define printk_info(xxx...) printk(KERN_INFO, xx...)
#else
#define printk_debug(xxx...) do { } while (0)
#define printk_info(xxx...) do { } while (0)
#endif
and so on?  This way debug messages could very simply be compiled to
oblivion when CONFIG_TINY is enabled.
