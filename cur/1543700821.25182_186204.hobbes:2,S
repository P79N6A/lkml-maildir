Count me in.
IBM ThinkPad T40p (PIIX IDE HDD access)
slackware-current
linux-2.6.0
reiserfs-3.6
I can reproduce the problem anytime simply by terminating an XDM session.
	- complete freeze
	- blank screen
	- can't see an oops
	- nothing in the logs
	- kernel won't panic (tried w/ the morsecode panics patch)
	- typically corrupted files (random garbage in the middle):
		/lib/modules/2.6.0/modules.dep
		/var/adm/messages
I'm hesitant in blaming hdd write cache since there's no power outage
involved (also I've never seen this before w/ 2.4).
