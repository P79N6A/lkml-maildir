What prompted my patch was observing situations where the icache (and dcache 
too) got so big that they were applying artifical pressure to the page and 
buffer caches. I say artifical since checking the stats these caches showed 
over 95% of the entries unused.  At this point there is usually another 10% 
or so of objects allocated by the slab caches but not accounted for in the 
stats (not a problem they are accounted if the cache starts using them).
Suspect your change to the prune logic is not going to help the above situation 
much - if the shrink functions are not called often enough we end up with over 
size caches.
