> Does hardware interrupt mitigation really interact well with NAPI?
It interacts quite excellently.
There was a long saga about this with tg3 and huge SGI numa
systems with large costs for interrupt processing, and the
fix was to do a minimal amount of interrupt mitigation and
this basically cleared up all the problems.
Someone should reference that thread _now_ before this discussion goes
too far and we repeat a lot of information and people like myself have
to stay up all night correcting the misinformation and
misunderstandings that are basically guarenteed for this topic :)
