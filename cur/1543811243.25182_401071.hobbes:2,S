Hi,
I've been trying to implement fbsplash on my computer; as you might be
concerned, this allows the user to specify background and *silent*
images to be shown at boot-time.
The nowadays oficially unmaintained Bootsplash, used to work on my
laptop back when I used 2.4.18. Now that I've switched to 2.6.10, can
notice how things has changed dramatically within the keyboard, n_tty or
related kernel layers.
The kernel says this is about my keyboard:
input: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard on isa0060/serio0
But even when I've got event interface compiled into my kernel (together
with event debugging), I'm not able to catch any key-press event till
the keyboard's been recognized by the input driver in this case.
I'm wondering whether is it possible at all to revert the situation so I
can catch again key-press events at boot-time, and still comply with the
actual kernel architecture as of 2.6.10.
I would really appreciate if someone could point me on where to start
from, or what to do about this.
Kind Regards,
