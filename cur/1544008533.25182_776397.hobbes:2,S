Those are all great explanations.  But, some of that needs to get in the
patch somehow.  This is a subtle thing and someone looking at this a
year for now is going to have difficulty understanding why it was done.

There is no practical problem if you have false-positives on this check
and do extra invalidations.  But, I think both Christoph and I are
nervous that this check is racy and there may be false-negatives and
thus may miss some invalidations (which would be harmful).
The check is racy which is cause for concern by itself.  But, with
careful consideration, it may not be a dangerous or harmful race.  Could
you please consider it carefully and share some of your thoughts in a
comment in the next version?
You need to check very, very carefully that there are no possible ways
for i_writecount to be elevated without a corresponding elevation of
d_count.  I'm especially concerned as I look at some of the mmap() code.
It appears that there are some temporary i_writecount elevations as
VM_DENYWRITE is figured out.  That needs some careful auditing to ensure
it doesn't violate what is being assumed in the integrity code.
