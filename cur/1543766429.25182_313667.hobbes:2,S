Only few patch modules are not so critical, however sometimes large
number of patches are applied at one time. In that case, time is very
critical with normal ptrace. As you know, normal ptrace need to target
process STOP whenever change the memory/registers.
Our approach is "do not stop the target process's execution as possible
as", because the target process can provide service during patch on SMP
machine (do not want to stop service due to patch).
If we load hundreds of patch modules at one time, I think it will goes
quite time critical..

Thank you, we'll fix this soon.

Well, this can change as you said, but I think, this makes target
process stopping time increase.
Because, to control target process's (patch module's) initialization,
the command process should know the target process's status and then
stop with ptrace.
Currently rt_handlereturn works on target process's context like signal
handler return, so, I think there is minimum time loss on target process.
If command process controls the target process's initialization, this
seems target process's stopping time increasing.
Well, may be our idea is wrong, please tell us.
Thank you your advice!
