I partially agree. Taken together with the policy of the calling process, 
things suddenly start to make more sense though (even if gzip/gunzip don't 
make good examples): if only allowed to execute /usr/bin/gzip, the calling 
process can still get the gunzip behavior, but it will be bound by 
the /usr/bin/gzip policy.
Controlling the policy is what we really care about; this limits the allowed 
behavior. We cannot really control the behavior of an application anyway 
(think of bugs alone), but we can set the bounds for that behavior.

Yes, allowing confined processes to change what they are allowed to execute 
under a more permissive policy is not such a good idea.
Thanks,
