I have mentioned this before when it was KERN_CRIT, why is this
KERN_WARNING? It seems reasonable to have loglevel at KERN_WARNING, then
it'd go to all consoles. Just because a fork bomb would trigger this
doesn't mean you can assume it is one and raise its severity.
If the limit is working correctly then there is no need to print anything...
Also, users can arbitrarily lower their limit at any time and trigger
this printk:
$ ulimit -Su 0
$ uptime
bash: fork: Resource temporarily unavailable
If you really think this is needed then the message needs changing,
because they haven't actually gone over the limit. I'm not sure how best
to word it. What about the other limits? Max memory size and cpu time
sound just as important as max user processes to me.
