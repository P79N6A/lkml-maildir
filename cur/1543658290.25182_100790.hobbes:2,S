OK, that's good.
Rusty, have you maintained the ia64 support of your in-kernel loader?
To be honest, I have less than zero interest in maintaining such code.
I'd rather prefer the old (user-level loader) or the new shared-object
loader.  (Of course, if someone else wants to volunteer, that would be
fine, too... ;-)
