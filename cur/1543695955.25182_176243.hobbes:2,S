virt_to_page() can handle any page in the standard kernel region
including pages that are physically in 64-bit space if the
architecture requires it. It doesn't handle vmalloc pages etc. but
one shouldn't try and dynamically map vmalloc pages at
random. pci_map_page() can handle all memory in the system though as
every page that can be mapped has a struct page * entry.
pci_map_page() is the correct API to use, pci_map_single() is
deprecated.
Cheers,
Jes
