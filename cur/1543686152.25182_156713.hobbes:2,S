 How about, launching the private workqueue threads on demand?
 a) Create thread/s then the first work gets scheduled.
 b) When the last pending work is done arm a timer or schedule a delayed
    special work that kills the thread/s after a while of idleness.
 c) When a new work gets added to an otherwise idle workqueue either:
 	- If we have thread/s we cancel the kill and go on.
	- Else we are back at a) we create it/them.
 And if instead of creating all threads at once, we create them one by
 one as work comes in and also kill them one by one as they stay idle,
 it could be quite smooth.
 How does this sound? Am I over-designing the issue?
 IMHO this would remove the threads of unused private workqueues without
 affecting busy workqueues. 
 About using a single thread instead of NN, wouldn't that impact
 workqueue users expecting speedy handling of their queues?
 Have a nice day
