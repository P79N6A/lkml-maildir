Yes, but some drivers did it anyway, though I can't remember under which
circumstances (IDE probe possibly ? It's a usual culprit for that sort
of thing). This is why most implementations use GFP_ATOMIC (including
sparc64 :-)

Oh well, I have no problem with leaving sparc32 do GFP_KERNEL indeed, I
can't remember for sure the reason why we have most architectures do
GFP_ATOMIC, but it probably never hit sparc32.
