Isn't there something similar to the multi-ethernet thingie to deal
with this? I haven't used SCSI myself, but I have configured several
machines with multiple different ethernet cards (typically NE2k and
Tulip, but there have been other combinations) where I have needed to
guarantee the order they are detected.
The fix in that case was to use lilo's "append=" facility to specify
which driver should grab which card, and if it doesn't already exist,
a similar facility is probably a good idea for SCSI...
Best wishes from Riley.
