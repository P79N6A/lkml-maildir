Right.  They're also the people who maintain the Linux AFS client,
last I used it (two years back, so it might have changed).  The big
reason I got from the post was that they needed these binaries so that
people could use AFS.  The people with these machines don't have a
problem recompiling their kernel, so they shouldn't have a problem
recompiling the kernel for any drivers they have source for.
If Monty would care to give an explanation of what sorts of other
modules they have to support, I'd be interested in hearing (because
I'm probably going to start a much smaller, but similar, system soon),
but I'm pretty sure the biggy is AFS.
