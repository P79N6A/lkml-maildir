Tekram 690 AFAIK. NOT TRM290 for sure.

dmesg states that TRM290 driver is there. And this is true -- this is kernel
with ALL ide quirk chips enabled (KSI-Linux generic kernel). It's not used
(I hope). Anyway: system works just fine with 2.2.5 and with any current version
of kernel it also works. Just speed is miserable (understandable: each IDE
operation ends with timeout, not by interrupt from IDE): 1-2KiB/sec...

Even if wrong driver for that tekram was chosen it does not affect
functionality: all works just fine with 2.2.2 & 2.2.5. With 2.2.10 and/or
2.3.36 all works but REALLY slow: in new kernels wrong IRQ is chosen and this
DOES affect functionality :-(( I tried to look on IRQ detection code in IDE
but it looks like total mess for innocent soul :-/

P.S. I can supply you any needed info, just not very fast: it's our main server
so I can not experiment with it freely :-/
