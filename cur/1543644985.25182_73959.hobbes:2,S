Overloading page->lru in this way is tricky.   If we can guarantee
that the page is anonymous (anonymise it if it's file-backed, pull
it out of swapcache) then fine, ->mapping, ->list.next, ->list.prev,
->index and ->private are available.
Can we do that?

Going from a pte back up to the owning MM is possible, yes.  See
mm/rmap.c:try_to_unmap_one().  The caller would have to hold the
page's rmap_lock.
