Subject: Very long startup time for a new thread

(This is on a 200 MIPS embedded architecture).
On a heavily loaded system (loadavg ~4) I create a new pthread. In this
situation it takes ~4 seconds (!) before the thread is first scheduled in
(yes, I have debug outputs in the scheduler to check that). In a 2.4 based
system I don't see the same thing. I don't have any RT or FIFO tasks. Any
ideas why it takes so long time and what I can do about it?
Appreciate any help
