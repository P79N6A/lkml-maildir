You mean it just toggles a bit periodically?

So, it locks not always?

Since you could backup to Jazz, looks like your filesystem is ok, NFS also
works in principle...

You could also attach a serial console and direct the output there (then
you also can scroll).

Why I am interested in your experiences is that I also have a problem
transferring large (several M) files over NFS when the server is 2.6 and
both ends have 100 FD. (You can see my posts this week about 2.6 NFS.) And
in my case it TCP fixed it. But I never had hard-locks, just cp hanged in
D, and tcpdump showed timed out reassembly on the receiving side. But I
was reading from the server.
