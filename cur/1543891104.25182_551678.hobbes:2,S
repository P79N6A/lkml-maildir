[PATCH 5/5] serial: assert DTR for serial console devices
Some RS-232 devices require DTR to be asserted before they can be
used.  DTR is normally asserted in uart_startup() when the port is
opened.  But we don't actually open serial console ports, so assert
DTR when the port is added.
BTW:
earlyprintk and early_uart are hard coded to set DTR/RTS.
