Matt aka Doofus festures mentioned the following:
| struct instruction_t local;
| __s16 *temp;
| 
| copy_from_user( &local, ( struct instruction_t * ) arg, sizeof( struct instruction_t ) );
| temp = kmalloc( sizeof( __s16 ) * local.rxlen, GFP_KERNEL );
| copy_from_user( temp, arg, sizeof( __s16 ) * local.rxlen );
I meant that last line to be:
copy_from_user( temp, local.rxbuf, sizeof( __s16 ) * local.rxlen );
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^
Which'd clear up any confusion as to why I'd want two copies of the same
argument.
That's the main crux of my query, can I retrieve the value of a pointer
in some struct passed via ioctl? In this case, the struct/chunk of memory
referenced by local.rxbuf, (which is rxlen x 2 bytes big).
Apologies, I'm a muppet.
Matt
PS. Thanks for the help so far, I'd meant to add error checking and what
not, I just kept it out to keep the e-mail smaller.
