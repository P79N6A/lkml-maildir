I'm suspecting these two patches won't be merged, but this fragment has
two bugs.  One is the whitespace bug already mentioned.  The other is that
the original test must still be used if that bus primitve doesn't exist.
And in a different vein, I'm a bit surprised that the update to the
feature-removal-schedule.txt file is a separate patch, but:
