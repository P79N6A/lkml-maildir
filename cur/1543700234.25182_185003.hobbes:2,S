Have you looked at the stability of the typical experimental feature?  
If we used that as a guide, we'd have sent it in 3 months ago.....;-)
We will have something we think is appropriate for inclusion as an 
experimental feature very soon now.  Because our test scripts have 
become much more sophisticated, it means more when we say we cannot 
crash it, and it will go from experimental to stable faster than V3 
did.  I won't predict how fast.
