yup, that's a leak.

So that sounds like a reiserfs bug.

And so does that.

Large amounts of memory got lost on the LRU lists.
There are some debugging patches in -mm which will help us to identify the
leaker.  Unfortunately they don't apply well to mainline kernels so it's
probably easiest to run the whole -mm lineup.  2.6.22-rc6-mm1 was
reasonably stable.
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/akpm/patches/2.6/2.6.22-rc6/2.6.22-rc6-mm1/broken-out/page-owner-tracking-leak-detector.patch
contains instructions on how to use the page leak detector.
Unfortunately I suspect that this will just show that the pages were
allocated from the core pagecache allocation functions so the result won't
be interesting.
Quite a few people are using reiserfs and yours is the only report of this
which I can recall.  Can you think of any reason why your setup differs
from most other people's?
