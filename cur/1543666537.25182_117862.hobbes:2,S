You have this completely backwards. /usr/include/{asm,linux} are
the headers from the kernel that the glibc was compiled against.
They should NOT never ever be symlinks to anywhere, but glibc's
own copies of the headers.
This is not 'RedHat braindamage', it's the way things should be.
Making them symlinks is the only braindamage here.
