Jens,
If a driver does not allocate requests through blk_get_request, will the 
rl->count[] tests need to be changed or do those drivers need to be 
changed? For example, if SCSI insterts a special request into the queue, 
then someone swaps the io scheduler with no outstanding normal requests 
(so the rl->counts will be zero), could the special request still be in 
the queue since it allocated its request using kmalloc (the request is 
allocated as part of the scsi command).
