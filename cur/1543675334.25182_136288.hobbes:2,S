Subject: problem with beep in 2.5.70

I have my console blength set to 80 and the frequency to 1800.
In 2.4.20 all is nice, but in 2.5.70 when ever a program beeps the
beep just keeps going, the only way to stop this is to issue a beep
command which seems to turn it off somehow.
Any assistance would be appreciated.
