I've got a set of EPIA boxes running these kernels - reliably. I would
suggest checking the RAM you used is up to spec first - I had a real
pain of a time with EPIA stuff until I used decent RAM. The stuff that
gave me problems worked fine on some other boards but only at 100Mhz bus
speed on the EPIA.
