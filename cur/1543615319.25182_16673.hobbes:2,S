I'll argue that it should never decrement. The host that was just
unregisrtered already has its host_id reserved and if we decrement,
this number will be reasigned to the next new scsi host.
Unless if the code for reservation that causes the conflicts
is removed (but I guess it has a reason).

That would not solve it. The problem is that one piece of code
tries to allocate unique numbers (and get them back to the pool
when they are not in use), another piece of code remembers the
old number that a scsi host had and whan it re-registers gives
it back its old host_no regardless if this number was re-assigned
to a new host.
Is there a function that given a string returns a unique number
for this string? That would do the job.
