Quotes from Marcin Dalecki (out of order)
Speaking first hand from a past life as an admin, scripts are the bread and
butter of a good admin.  And now as a writer of a lot of user code
(C/C++/Java) I see many extremely useful benefits that aren't available
elsewhere.

hits the nail on the head.  Perl (I love/hate it too...), AWK, SED, bash,
etc are the tools of trade.  Their flexibility and rapid devel time are
perfect for the toolkit of most sys admins.  I would have killed to have
/proc on the other UNIX machines I was in charge of.

You would be surprised.  Not just sys admins, but some user code, that does
what some people need, use the strangest info.  And with drivers there are
the strangest knobs sometimes, and believe it or not people turn them.  And
most often they are turned using those evil scripts.

It's more than cute.  /proc has info not available elsewhere without having
to go into /dev/kmem.  And the nice thing about a file system is that (with
guidelines) people can put all their uncoordinated extensions in the proper
place.  The hierarchy allows some order in the chaos.

Actually the bloat/mess has to be somewhere.  Either in userspace trying to
make sense/stay in sync with the kernel structures, or in the kernel where
it has the structures.  Obviously everything shouldn't go in /proc, but
there things that are simplier either in the kernel or in user space.
In some of the embedded projects we do space is a big issue, and /proc
actually allows us to save space by not putting a lot of tools (like ps) in
the precious flash.
