Hm, from looking at the code (mm/bootmem.c), I would say, that:
static void __init reserve_bootmem_core(bootmem_data_t *bdata, unsigned long
addr, unsigned long size)
{
        unsigned long i;
        /*
         * round up, partially reserved pages are considered
         * fully reserved.
         */
        unsigned long sidx = (addr - bdata->node_boot_start)/PAGE_SIZE;
        unsigned long eidx = (addr + size - bdata->node_boot_start + 
                                                        PAGE_SIZE-1)/PAGE_SIZE;
        unsigned long end = (addr + size + PAGE_SIZE-1)/PAGE_SIZE;
        if (!size) BUG();
        if (sidx < 0)    
                BUG();   
Can sidx < 0 happen? sidx is unsigned long... Shouldn't "(addr <
bdata->node_boot_start)" be checked instead which would implicitely check eidx,
too. Or not?
        if (eidx < 0)    
                BUG();   
s.a. ...
        if (sidx >= eidx)
                BUG();
        if ((addr >> PAGE_SHIFT) >= bdata->node_low_pfn)
                BUG();
        if (end > bdata->node_low_pfn)
                BUG();
        for (i = sidx; i < eidx; i++)
                if (test_and_set_bit(i, bdata->node_bootmem_map))
                        printk("hm, page %08lx reserved twice.\n",
i*PAGE_SIZE);
}
Just as a note ... not really important, though.

Stephan
