Sure you can do that, you would probably have to provide quite a bit of
the mapping infrastructure (or make it generic, probably Ben's work in
this area would be the best way forward). But bio is a generic container
for block I/O, and you are allowed to use it directly.

allocate a private bio, and you 'own' the bi_private and bi_end_io. So
you could do something ala
	DECLARE_COMPLETION(wait);
	bio = bio_alloc(GFP_XXX, 1);
	/* fill in bvec, target, etc */
	bio->bi_private = &wait;
	bio->bi_end_io = my_end_io;
	...
	wait_for_completion(&wait);
int my_end_io(struct bio *bio, int nr_sectors)
{
	struct completion *wait = bio->bi_private;
	/* do end i/o stuff */
	...
	/* wake up waiters */
	complete(wait);
	return 0;
}
