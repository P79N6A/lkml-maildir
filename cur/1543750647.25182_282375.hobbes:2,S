Subject: [PATCH] disallow modular capabilities

There's been a bugtraq report about a root exploit with modular
capabilities LSM support out for more than a week.
This patch fixes it the hard way by disallowing to build the code
modular.  In fact I think allowing modular security policies is a 
really, really bad idea because loading it after boot loses far
too much state.  Would you take a patch killing the exports in
security/ ?
