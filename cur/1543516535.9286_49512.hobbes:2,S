A number that changes irregularly depending on your latitude/longitude and
the time.
Definitly this logic can't go into the kernel.
OTOH, if you want the timezone value in the kernel you'd need a userspace
demon to keep it updated all the time, in which case you would have no win
over the current situation.
(Please note that the trickery the kernel does to "detect" the timezone
is far from being correct. It's only a hack for those poor people using
windows).

Now the question would be "how to inform the kernel about the timezone"?
(And keep the info updated).
