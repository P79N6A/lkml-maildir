Because it is charged to another device. No matter how many of them are
chained, limit is applied to the last device being used.
So, if you have unlimited number of threads, each one allocates a
request, forward it down to low-level devices, each one will eventually
sleep, but yes, each one _can_ allocate _one_ request before it goes
sleeping. It is done to allow fain-grained limits, since some devices
(like locally attached disks) do not require throttling.
Here is an example with threads you mentioned:
