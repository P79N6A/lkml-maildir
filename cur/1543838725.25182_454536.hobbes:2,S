Kirill,
Thanks for posting the patches to ckrm-tech. I 'll look into it and post
my comments tomorrow.
Some documentation (or pointer to the documentation) on how to use this
feature and high level design would really help.
How does the hierarchy work ? (May be reading the code would clear it
up :).
few comments below..

Since the core functionality is arch independent, why not have the
Kconfig stuff in some generic place like init/Kconfig ?

wondering why we need three of these ?

I agree with Rohit that configfs based interface would be more easy to
use (you will not get into the system call number issue that Greg has
pointed too).

again, configfs would be easier.
