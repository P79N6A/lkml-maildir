And/or reduce RAM at kernel boot, etc. Anyway, I also asked for 'sync'
yesterday and Grant included some but not after every each tests.
I run the results through some scripts to make it more readable.
It indeed has some interesting things ...

BTW, zsh has a built-in 'time' so measuring a full operation can be
easily done as 'sync; time ( my_test; sync )'
