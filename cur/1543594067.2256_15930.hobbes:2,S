hi everybody,
   when i tried to read the inode of proc file/directory
using a  pointer to dirent which is returned by the readdir().,
i am getting a different inode number(32449)instead of which
 is shown as inode 2 when ls -ia is done.
 hope it is clear.. 
  thanks for all who tried to clarify my doubt..
