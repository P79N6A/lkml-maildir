That was in the first version of the patch, but Christoph Hellwig asked 
to drop the EMBEDDED.
The version I sent to you contained a dependency on EXPERIMENTAL, to 
indicate that -Os is less tested, and the help text says
  If unsure, say N.
IMHO this should be enough, so that only people who know what they are 
doing use this option.
