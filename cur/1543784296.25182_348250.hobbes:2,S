This was done because I didn't like to assume:

Although if we're happy with that assumption (which I am), the
simplification can be made. 
Alternatively, would you accept a patch to add an optional delay option
to mmc_detect_change()? Something like the patch below but with all the
callers updated and the pxa platform data amended to pass the optional
delay. As a case for this, the same debounce timer is needed for corgi,
poodle, hx2750, spitz and tosa.
This also highlights that schedule_delayed_work() with delay=0 isn't
special cased which perhaps it should be?
