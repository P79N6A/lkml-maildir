Hi,
I´m trying to get nvnet (NVidia´s closed source ethernet driver) to work with 2.5.70 kernel. I got it to compile, but when I try to load it I get an error message "module format invalid". By comparing the output of readelf -r of it with other modules, I noticed that it´s missing the following:
Relocation section '.rel.gnu.linkonce.this_module' at offset 0x9ac contains 2 entries:
 Offset     Info    Type            Sym.Value  Sym. Name
00000068  00002501 R_386_32          00000090   init_module
0000010c  00002101 R_386_32          00000000   cleanup_module
I think that it may be the problem, but I really don´t have a clue on how to include these two.
Any help would be great.
Thank you,
Marcelo Penna Guerra
