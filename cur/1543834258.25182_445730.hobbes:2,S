Weird, I had even checked if they weren't already done:
http://kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/axboe/linux-2.6-block.git;a=blob;h=102ebc2c5c34c73f8e7f76c589559ddfde0d9885;hb=82d6897fefca6206bca7153805b4c5359ce97fc4;f=block/cfq-iosched.c
Am I looking at the wrong repos, or is it just not in sync
with your daily work?
With friendly regards,
Takis
