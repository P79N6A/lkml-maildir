Hi Willy.
Thanks a lot for the initiative , This is the brief list of
vulnerabilities i am concerned/aware about right now.Will keep looking
for patches in the days to come.
 Please feel free to ask for more help , I am ready to volunteer for
the cause of
making the open source kernel secure .
PS : Let me know the approach to get subsequent updates from you ?

 A] CAN-2004-1235
  Linux 2.4.29-ow1 is out. Linux 2.4.29, and thus 2.4.29-ow1, adds a
number of security fixes,   including to the x86/SMP page fault
handler (CAN-2005-0001) and the uselib(2)  (CAN-2004-1235) race
conditions, both discovered by Paul Starzetz. The potential of these 
bugs is a local root compromise. The uselib(2) bug does not affect
default builds of Linux kernels with the Openwall patch applied since
the vulnerable code is only compiled in if one explicitly enables
CONFIG_BINFMT_ELF_AOUT, an option introduced by the patch.
2] Same as above [CAN-2004-12345 but just fixes the uselib
vulnerabilty , I dont know again which one to pick
http://kerneltrap.org/node/4503
Marcelo Tosatti [interview] released the 2.4.29-rc1 Linux kernel with
"a SATA update [and a] bunch of network driver updates". He went on to
note, "more importantly it fixes a sys_uselib() vulnerability
discovered by Paul Starzetz". He adds, "[upgrading] is recommended for
users of v2.4.x mainline, distros should be releasing their updates
real soon now." The vulnerability allows local users to gain root
privileges:
