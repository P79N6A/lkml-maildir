 From looking at irq.c (2.4.31) I guess that calling free_irq()
on SMP after cli() is not safe because of the race you describe.

shutdown() seems a little backwards:
it calls free_irq(), then it disables device interrupts.
One way of handling this may be to move the code
block (the if statement after 'Free the IRQ' comment)
that calls free_irq() to after the restore_flags().
At that point, the device is no longer generating
interrupts and has been removed from the IRQ_ports
list so the ISR will not touch the device instance
and free_irq() can finish safely.
