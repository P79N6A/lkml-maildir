Sure, just port it to C.
Seriously, you can do it in C++, but you'll hate yourself
afterwards, and nobody in the Linux community will support
you when you have problems.  C++ just does not mix well
with the Linux kernel.  This is not a shortcoming of the
Linux kernel; this is a fairly well-founded design decision,
discussed to death once every six months.
If you do decide to pursue it, do it in a way that does
not require any patches to the kernel source, and please
do NOT submit any patches related to this to the linux kernel mailing list.
