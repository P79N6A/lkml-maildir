Alan,
I think highly of women and even employ one in a programming position -
there is no bias on my part. In fact, she is even ON the linuxchix
mailinglist, and I suspect that she would've appreciated my joke.
If people feel put of by me making a joke, well, I apologise for that.
In my not so humble opinion however, I didn't insult anybody above, but then
again, I've been known to be wrong.
Regards,
bert
