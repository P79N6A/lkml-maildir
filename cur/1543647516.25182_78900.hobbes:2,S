# [PATCH] Compaq PCI Hotplug bug fix 2
# 
# Your patch may fix the issue, but I think there is an
# easier way.  I found another bug that was preventing the
# existing scheme from working.  It looks like the function
# "pcibios_set_irq_routing" is returning 1 for success, but
# the hot plug driver was interpreting it as failure.
# 
# The attached 2 line patch fixes it for me.  I am able to
# add an Intel NIC on an ML370 G2 and receive interrupts from
# it.
