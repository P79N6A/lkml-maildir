I agree, but this is just an opinion.  (I see where Greg KH wants to merge it 
into the kernel.)

I agree that programming talent can exist without the ability to speak 
English.  But will the resulting patches get merged if the developer can't 
communicate with the Linux development community?
I dealt with a programmer on the BusyBox project who only speaks Russian, and 
uses a babelfish variant to translate everything.  This was incredibly 
frustrating: he regularly misunderstood what we were saying, we regularly had 
no idea what he was saying, his attempts at commenting the code were often 
worse than not commeting it at all, and after three years his ability to 
communicate hadn't improved in the slightest.
Possibly we'd need some volunteer translators just for the purpose of merging 
code in languages we'd translated the documentation into?  A "chinese patch 
maintainer" or some such?
