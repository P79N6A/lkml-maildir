Hmm good question, I'll do further tests, but from my past experiences I 
got the feeling that it's rather the sound that is needed to trigger the 
freeze, not the network load.
A few lines from dmesg puzzle me too, like:
spurious 8259A interrupt: IRQ7. -> What is that, and why?
mtrr: your CPUs had inconsistent fixed MTRR settings
mtrr: probably your BIOS does not setup all CPUs.
mtrr: corrected configuration. -> Maybe not corrected correctly?
BIOS failed to enable PCI standards compliance, fixing this error. -> 
Maybe not really fixed?
Thanks for your effort,
Gilles May
