It looks real.  It was executing this line of clear_inode in fs/inode.c:
380         if (inode->i_sb && inode->i_sb->s_op && inode->i_sb->s_op->clear_inode)
                                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                           and it blew up here ----->
Seemingly, the page the inode's sb->super_block_operations lives on was freed 
between the test of i_sb->s_op and ->s_op->clear_inode.  This gets out of my 
territory.  Other than SMP, I don't see how this can happen.  I reformatted 
your oops (gack, too many timestamps) and provided a disassembly....
