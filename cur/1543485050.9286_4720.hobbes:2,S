It just stabilized. The 2.2.1+ kernels with knfsd-981204 run very nicely on
my machines. Nice performance and finally stable.
NFS over TCP: Never tried. I believe Alan gas patches in his ac releasese to
   make it usable.
NFSv3: Not yet supported (though implementation already started, IIRC) and
   most probably won't be within 2.2.
