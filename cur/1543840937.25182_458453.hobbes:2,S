Hi,
I think this is a time to step down from my SUPERH architecture
maintainerships.  The major development issues for this port
seem to shift on the hardwares I can't access and I have no
recent activity on kernel.  I shouldn't qualify as a maintainer
of SUPERH port now and there is no problem because Paul is
actively maintaining it.  The attached patch drops my name,
address and web URL from MAINTAINERS file.
Regards,
	kaz
