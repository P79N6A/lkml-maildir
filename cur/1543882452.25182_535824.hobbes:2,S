Sorry! Should be:
"If this runs while a work function is fired in run_workqueue,
it sets _PENDING bit, but if the work skips rearming, I have probably
endless loop, again."

I think, theoretically, probably, maybe, there is possible some strange
case, this function gets spin_lock only when: list_empty(&work->entry) == 1
&& _PENDING == 1 && del_timer(&dwork->timer) == 0.

OK. Here is the review:
It looks great!!! I cannot believe, it could be so "easy"!
