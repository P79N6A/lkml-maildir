Hi all,
I have several problems, can somebody help me, please.
I have problem with ipfwadm from red hat 5.2 distribution in kernel 2.2.1
ipfwadm is not supported in kernel 2.2.1?
If i try ipfwadm -I -l, the reply is cannot open /proc/net/ip_input
If i try ipfwadm -F -a accept the reply is
ipfwadm:setsockopt failed: No such file or directory
	When making menuconfig, all firewall options (incl. experimental) are Yes, but probably something missing. Somebody help me, please.
When I run ipfwadm in kernel from distribution, everything is OK.
My second problem is in Traffic Shaper. 
Thanks all for previous replies to my question.
Yes, it must be a module, can't be on eth0 (master IF), and must be attached to device with real IP. 
If i make a 2.2.1 kernel with Traffic Shaper option set to M, Traffic shaper running good, and I can cut down speed. 
It's very simply, and nice. Thanks, Alan.
But if I do Ctrl+C for example in FTP is transfering file, computer where shaper is running (a router) will hang. I must do cold restart.
Alan or somebody, please, help me. I reach end of my knowledge and my power.
Than You all very much for Your replies.
Have a nice weekend.
