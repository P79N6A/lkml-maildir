Since it gives Rules.make the wrong file names in $(obj-[ym]), and relies 
on implementation details inside of Rules.make in combination with the 
vpath statement to make things work despite those wrong names.

So did you decide to move things from drivers/oprofile/$(ARCH) to 
arch/$(ARCH)/oprofile? It's possible to make it work, but not pretty. As I 
said before, kbuild actually expects to have all parts of a single module 
to be in a single dir. This can be lifted a little bit as done for xfs, 
but spreading parts all over the tree is not very desirable IMO.
