Yes, but that wasn't his patch. He split off the
constant text in the bugline to a separate string and
made sure /that/ string was used only once.
The old way contained the 'kernel BUG at' string a
zillion times, now it only contains 'bla.c: 412'
and variants thereof a lot of times. (And most of
them are NO duplicates, or you would have had 2 BUGs
at the same line...
