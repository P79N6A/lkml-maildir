Ah... that's weird.  It would be much better if -rc3-mm1 is broken too.  :-P

Hmm... SGT not on qword boundary?  Please add the following to the end
of sil24_port_start() and report successful and failed kernel boot log.
	printk("XXX sil24 cb=%p cb_dma=%llx\n",
		cb, (unsigned long long)cb_dma);
Also, does 'dmesg -s 10000000' give full dmesg?

I can't tell but there is a pretty large userbase of sil24/32 and you
seem to be the only one to report this problem yet.  I think it might be
coming somewhere else than libata or sata_sil24 itself.  Hmmm... It
would be really great if you can break -rc3-mm1 too.  Correct behavior
for something like that for just one -mm version sounds very weird.
Thanks.
