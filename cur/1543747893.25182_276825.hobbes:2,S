Subject: Re: [PATCH] Document kfree and vfree NULL usage (resend)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The attached patch changes the vfree() documentation to correct "May not be 
called in interrupt context" to "Must not be called in interrupt context". 
Latter is compliant to  RFC2119 and matches the absolute requirement for  
vfree.
Is not the same requirement true for vmalloc() - or is it ok to call vmalloc() 
in interrupt?
