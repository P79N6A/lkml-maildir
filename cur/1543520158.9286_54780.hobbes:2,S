Hi Rik.

The algorithms I know about seem to be along the lines of the
following:
 1. Read a dozen or so pages of source code looking for
    whatever bug one is after. Drink several large mugs
    of coffee whilst doing so.
 2. Toss a coin. If heads, go to step 3; if tails, go to
    step 4; if it lands on its edge, go to step 5.
 3. Note a bug one wasn't looking for, and fix it. Go to
    step 1.
 4. Overlook the bug one was looking for. Go to step 1.
 5. Have a brainwave, and go directly to the bug and fix
    it, even though it was nowhere near the code one was
    looking at. Go to step 1.
Put any timescale you care to against that lot.

The "GSA" is basically the above with step 3 omitted in my
experience.
Best wishes from Riley.
