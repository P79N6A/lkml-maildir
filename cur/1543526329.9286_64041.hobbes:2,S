Hi hackers,
Could we please make sure a working ac97_codec gets put in the patches for
2.3.47?  It seems to me his patch to 2.3.45 didn't make it into 2.3.46, thus
causing all sorts of problems wrt mixers.
Also, Mr. Lho, other hackers, I did note some problems with sound after
that, though I don't know if they were related to X11/Gnome/XMMS or not.  I
was playing MP3's with XMMS in IceWM/Gnome and sound events were turned on.
When I would go to open something or try to restore a minimized app, nothing
would happen until I killed/shut XMMS.  Is this a driver problem?
One other thing I'd like to note is that with my card (es1371), at least
under that Microsoft OS for normal consumers, you can fool with the Registry
and add tone (bass/treble) controls.  (SB PCI64D (latest driver calls it a
128D)).  I Am Not A Coder, but I did see some stuff for tone in the
appropriate drivers.  Is there support for tone controls, and if so, where
is it/what mixer applet handles it/etc?  I'll be happy to test if someone
can help me out by telling me what I need to do.
Thanks a lot,
JT
