It's alpha sx164. But I don't think the firmware does anything wrong here,
it just put e100 in "sleep" or "soft off" state.
I think a general rule is that you cannot access device MEM or IO registers
without pci_enable_device first (or making sure that the device is actually
enabled in other ways).
