I don't believe there was one.  Jan simply didn't push much, so noone
was forced to resist him.  And noone else needed union mount enough to
push Jan.

Welcome to Jan's work. :)
If you want to make this vision happen, one of the missing pieces is a
method for copyup, an in-kernel copying routine.  Unionfs needs is
just the same as Jan's patches do and in the past Linus didn't like my
approach of using sendfile for it.  You could take a stab at the
splice code and see how that can be used for copyup.
