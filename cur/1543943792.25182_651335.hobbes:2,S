Subject: [patch 2.6.24-git] rtc: avoid legacy drivers with generic framework
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/10/247

Kconfig tweaks to help reduce RTC configuration bugs, by avoiding
legacy RTC drivers when the generic RTC framework is enabled:
 - If rtc-cmos is selected, disable the legacy rtc driver;
 - When using generic RTC on x86, enable rtc-cmos by default;
 - In the old "chardev RTC" section of Kconfig, add a comment
   warning people off these (seven) legacy RTC drivers when
   the generic framework is in use.
People can still use the legacy drivers if they want (or need) to.

This doesn't fix the broken dependencies for the legacy "CMOS" RTC
driver.  Ideally it would be a full list of platforms where it works,
not a partial list of ones where it won't.  Or better yet, it would
depend on a "HAVE_CMOS_RTC" flag defined by various platforms ...
surely there's a Kconfig style guideline lurking there.
