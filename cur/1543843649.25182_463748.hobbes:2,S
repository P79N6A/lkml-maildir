Well, last time I have checked, SystemTAP did not have a reentrant serialisation
mechanism to write the information to the buffers. Also, the goals of the
projects differ : SystemTAP finds acceptable to suffer from the kprobe
performance hit while it is unacceptable for LTTng.

I think that each projet focus on their own different goals but that there is
much to gain in reusing the strenghts of each.
SystemTAP is good at dynamic instrumentation.
LTTng is good at data serialisation under a fully reentrant kernel.
LTTng provides logging primitives for any data type, including SystemTAP text
output.
Is someone willing to try to create a small facility that will dump SystemTAP's
output in LTTng ? It is nearly trivial : if I wasn't completing my debugfs port,
I would probably be doing it right now.

A standard event header has to have only crucial information, nothing more, or
it becomes bloated and quickly grow trace size. We decided not to put tid and
CPU id in the event header because tid is already available with the schedchange
events at post-processing time and CPU id is already available too, as we have
per CPU buffers.
The event size is completely unnecessary, but in reality very, very useful to
authenticate the correspondance between the size of the data recorded by the
kernel and the size of data the viewer thinks it is reading. Think of it as a
consistency check between kernel and viewer algorithms.
