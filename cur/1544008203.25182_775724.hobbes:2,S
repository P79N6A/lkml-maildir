A few items:
          res 40/00:00:48:19:67/00:00:1e:00:00/40 Emask 0x50 (ATA bus error)
          ata3: SError: { UnrecovData HostInt 10B8B BadCRC }
These are usually realted to a bad cable or connector.
ata3: SATA link up 1.5 Gbps (SStatus 113 SControl 310)
Did you remove the 1.5 Gbps jumper so it can run at 3.0 Gbps?
