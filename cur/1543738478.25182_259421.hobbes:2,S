Ahh.. Yes. I was confused, because there is only one "insert_region()" 
ain arch/i386/pci/i386.c, so I just automatically assumed CaT changed that 
one without looking at the details.
So if CaT changed the "request_resource()" in to an "insert_resource()"
in pcibios_allocate_bus_resources(), then that explains the impossible
dmesg.
Cat: change that one back, and the function to look at is
"pcibios_allocate_resources()" (almost the same name, but no "bus" in it),
which has a "insert_resource()" in it. That "insert_resource()" should be
a "request_resource()" (and for you it won't matter, but other people will
likely want to additionally apply Shaohua's patch to put in ACPI resources
last).
Hope this clears it all up. Knock wood.
