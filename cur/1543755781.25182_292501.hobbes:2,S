I didn't say it was unreasonable, I said it could be better.

Indeed, for now the differences are rather small. But with more and
more BK trees and more merges between them the proportion will raise.
If Andrew were to start using BK today we could immediately lose
(on the CVS side) a big part of the history.

I may be stupid, but I did write several months ago a bitkeeper to
prcs conversion tool, and this followed BK branches. It's a 269 lines 
python script including documentation. I can send you that if you like.
The script does basically:
	for each bk changeset {
		get cset parent, merge parent, tags, comment, date
		prcs checkout -r bktoprcsbranch(cset) parent
		for each bk changeset rename {
			prcs rename 
		}
		bk export changeset
		if merge parent {
			prcs merge with merge parent
		}
		if cset ends in .1 {
			prcs create branch
		}
		prcs checkin bktoprcsbranch(cset)
		if bk has tag {
			prcs tag
		}
	}
	with bktoprcsbranch(cset) returning the bk 'branch', 
	1 for the 'trunk' and x.y.z for a x.y.z.t revision.
It is a bit difficult to get it right wrt renames, deletes etc, and
it can take quite a while to execute, but 3 man month work is a bit
extreme.

I thought the competition was between the tools not the data inside...
Why is that every time someone wants the full history of the kernel
you think it wants to compete with you ? That history is not even a
secret, everybody can get it from BK/web or by running the free
edition of BK (if allowed).
