You don't get rid of that complexity by offloading it to a µcontroller. 
The only thing you achieve that way is making sure it's quite likely to
be done badly, and making it impossible to debug.

Do it the naïve way with a single byte push/pull and waggling the
control lines separately, and what you say is true -- but you can have
flash controllers which assist with data transfer but still give you
essentially 'raw' access to the chip.
With the CAFÉ controller designed for the OLPC machine, we can spew data
across the PCI bus just as fast as we can suck it off the flash chip.

Yes, it's certainly possible that we _could_ write a file system which
is specifically targeted at FTL -- I was just wondering why anyone would
_bother_ :)
I've seen an interesting file system which does have a kind of FTL
internally as its lowest layer, and which build on that using 'virtual'
sectors for file extents. Now that _does_ have its advantages -- but it
doesn't go as far as pretending to be a 'normal' block device; it's its
own special thing for internal use within that file system.

There really is no reason why FTL has to be done badly; just as there's
no _reason_ why hardware vendors have to give us crappy bsVendorCode.
Nevertheless, that's the way the world tends to be. So good luck
shipping with that :)
