What is that ? like randomly boosting without tracking which thread is
inside an RCU critical section ?

Lock holder as in mutex held below and RCU critical section ?

This needs a notion of RCU read side ownership to boost those preempted
threads.

The scary thing about what you're doing is that all of the techniques
you've named (assuming that I understand you correctly) requires a
notion of an owner and ownership tracking. That's just going to kill
RCU read side performance if you do that whether it be a list per reader
or something else like that. It's a tough problem.
Don't know what to think about it other than some kind of tracking or
boosting logic in the per CPU run queue or the task struct itself during
the boost operation. But you're still stuck with the problem of what
to boost and how to find that out during an RCU sync side. It's still
an ownership problem unless Esben can think of another way of getting
around that problem.
That's why I suggested a priority ceiling or per CPU priority threshold
tracking (+ CPU binding) the priority of the irq-threads and stuff. It's
a simple hack to restore the cheesy preempt count stuff without having
to revert to invasive ownership tracking for each reader.
It's just an idea. Maybe it'll be useful to you.
