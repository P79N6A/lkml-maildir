OK, well you could call set_buffer_write_io_error/set_buffer_read_io_error()
in the end_io handlers, and pick that up later on.
To avoid adding a couple of new clear_bits in submit_bh,
you could do:
	if (test_set_buffer_req(bh)) {
		clear_buffer_write_io_error(bh);
		clear_buffer_read_io_error(bh);
	}
