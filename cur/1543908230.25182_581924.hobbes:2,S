No, it won't. cpu_is_something() is intended for runtime decisions.
Remember that the purpose of this patch was to solve a compile time
issue (see subject). AT91_SDRAMC_SRR isn't defined properly for
non-9200 processors because they don't have that register. So we need
something like #ifdef to include this line only on 9200.
