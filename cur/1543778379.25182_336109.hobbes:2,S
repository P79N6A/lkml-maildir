yes, this approach is valid.
I've done the exact same measurements for 100HZ vs 1000HZ.
For currently shipping laptops, I didn't see a significant
difference.,
Note that the quality of the instrumentation on
the battery can vary widely, and so if you really
want the best numbers you need to start from a fully
charged battery and run it until the battery dies.
Also, for the most controlled experiment, you can
run in single user mode with no network, no USB plugged
in, and either "performance" or "powersave" governors.
If you don't get into C3 on this box nearly all the time
then something is wrong.
cheers,
