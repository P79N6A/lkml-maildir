Dont post networking related patches on other lists. I havent seen said
patch, but it seems someone is complaining about some behavior changing?
In regards to link down and packets being queued.
Agreed this is a little problematic for some apps/transports. TCP is
definetely not one of them. TCP in Linux actually is told if the drop is
local. This way it can make better judgement (and not unnecesarily
adjust windows for example).
SCTP AFAIK is the only transport that provides its apps opportunity to
obsolete messages already sent. I am not sure how well implemented or
whtether it is implemented at all. Someone working on SCTP could
comment.
In the case the netdevice is administratively downed both the qdisc and
DMA ring packets are flushed. Newer packets will never be queued and
you should quickly be able to find from your app that the device is
down.
In the case of netdevice being operationally down - I am hoping this is
what the discussion is, having jumped on it - both queues stay intact.
What you can do is certainly from user space admin down/up the device
when you receive a netlink carrier off notification.
I am struggling to see whether dropping the packet inside the tx path
once it is operationaly down is so blasphemous ... need to get caffeine
first.
