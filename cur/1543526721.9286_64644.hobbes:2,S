I agree, if the fd created by accept() inherits the ownership & flags 
from the listening fd, that gets rid of the race condition when an event 
comes in between accept() and F_SETFAST.
But it has a race condition in the case where a single thread listens
and passes connections to a bunch of nonlistening threads;
then you'd need to do a F_SETOWN immediately after accept(),
else an event might go to the wrong place.
If we want that case to be race-free, we might need a system call
that atomically did accept(), F_SETOWN, FASYNC and F_SETSIG together.  
(Can anyone channel W. Richard Stevens?  He was pretty good at seeing race conditions...)

If you empty the queue with a tight loop, and defer processing
the events, that would let you properly ignore stale fd events
But if there are multiple threads both listening for new connections
and handling old ones, that might give all the pending events to the 
thread about to do an accept().  Is that good?
Also, what if there's more than one queue (e.g. a listening
socket with one owner/signum, and connected sockets with a
different owner/signum)?  Which queue do you empty?  Better
to use an atomic accept()+F_SETFAST combo that generates an
'fd created' signal, then there's no need to empty any queue.

The accept (well, fd creation) events are there so you
don't have to make sure the queue is empty before you call accept().
Not only that - they make it so the user variable that tracks
the poll state of the fd can be fed solely by events, without ever
bypassing the signal queue.  This seems like a Good Thing for
eliminating race conditions.

e.g. sockets created by open() on special files?  I suppose they
would need an atomic open()/F_SETFAST+signal generating combo call,
too.  But I think we can leave that for later, since nobody I know is 
doing that kind of I/O at the moment.

Yes, those are two current workarounds.  Zach, which do you use
(or do you use both, or something different)?

Perhaps you misunderstand - I wasn't talking about poll() fallback.
I was pointing out that adding the "fd created" signal means
that the signals become a complete specification of the
poll state of the fd; there's no gap between creation and turning
on events where the fd's poll state can change unseen.

It's a good idea, but I think I pointed out a race condition 
above for server programs that want a single listener socket 
plus a bunch of worker sockets with a different owner/signum.
The only solution for that one is an atomic 
accept()+F_SETFAST+"fd created" signal queueing call (right?).

I don't like the swapping between two signal numbers idea,
simply because it could be easy to get confused which one was
which...
Thanks for your ideas.
