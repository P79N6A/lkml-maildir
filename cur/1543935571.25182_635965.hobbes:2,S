It seems that the kernel janitors project needs to explicitly describe the
prerequisites a person should meet before tackling the enterprise's toughest
technical challenges such as operating system kernel development.
On the face of it, it seems quite ridiculous to me that a team of extremely
qualified kernel engineers spend their valuable time teaching the basics of
the C language using this mailing list. Time is precious, and even more so
when we are having that many unresolved problems, e.g. when the Kernel Bug
Tracker lists more than 1300 open bugs:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/buglist.cgi?order=relevance&bug_status=__open__
Paolo, I have nothing against you personally as you seem to have adequately
reacted to what is going on and went on strengthening your C skills; my point
is that an operating system kernel development facility such as LKML is most
probably not the right place to set up a correspondence course in programming
basics.
