I tried it on an OSDL machine and could suspend (suspend 2), but only
resume as far as copying back the original kernel. The problem then
looked to me like it was request ids not matching what the drive was
expecting (but I'm ignorant of scsi, so might be completely wrong
there).

With my 'device tree' code, I'm getting the struct dev of the device
we're using via the struct block_device in the swap_info struct.
