The skb structure has other fields and if you fiddle with them by hand
you break those and you end up breaking if the skb internals change.
Eg if you set skb->len you must set skb->tail. Functions like
skb_addd_data, skb_put, skb_trim, etc do the right thing in all cases.

Yes. It might take a clock or two longer but it sets skb->tail right and
is rather more future proof.
