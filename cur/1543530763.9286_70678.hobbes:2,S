It was never a system problem to begin with. The question is, which
process does the system kill? It has to kill one process - killing the
one which requested the memory is a case of "shooting the messenger".

In practice, they usually just die.

Most systems don't have/suffer from that degree of micromanagement.

I never suggested it should - if it ever crashes, this is a bug. This
is NOT what we are discussing here. The system doesn't crash - it just
kills one or more processes. The issue is, WHICH process?

Which is the aim of Rik's patch, largely. Until we actually have
per-user resource quotas, though, there is not a lot you can do about
it.

No - inetd just gets an OOM error, and dies. Same as before.

No. If a child dies, it spawns a replacement (just like inetd, init
etc. do). If the parent dies (as it would, for OOM situations) the WWW
site is down.

They shouldn't be able to anyway - Rik's patch should ensure that init
will always survive, even if every other process on the box is hosed.
(Of course, if init was the malfunctioning process to begin with...)
>All else is a matter of implementation.
The core problem remains. You, the user, have a finite amount of
memory available to you, however that limit is defined. Once you run
out, your processes will start dying.
We need per-user resource limits, ideally - until then, everything is
done with process granularity instead. This is a shortcoming we all
know about already, but not one that is likely to be fixed any time
soon.
