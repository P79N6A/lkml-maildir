Subject: [PATCH] Documentation for proc_file_read
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/2/2/112

Here is a patch that improves (I hope) the documentation
of how user proc-file-read functions should interface with
proc_file_read().  At this stage I just ask that any
interested parties review what I have written.  // Thomas

+			 * How to be a proc read function
+			 * ------------------------------
+			 *
+			 * Prototype:
+			 *    int f(char *buffer, char **start, off_t offset,
+			 *          int count, int *peof, void *dat)
+			 *
+			 * You may assume that the buffer provided is at least
+			 * 3 KiB in size.
+			 *
+			 * If you know you have supplied all the data there is,
+			 * set the *peof bit.
+			 *
+			 * Three ways to return data:
+			 * A) Set *start = NULL
+			 *    Put the data of the requested offset at that
+			 *    offset within the buffer.  Return the number (n)
+			 *    of bytes there are from the beginning of the
+			 *    buffer up to the last byte of data.  If the
+			 *    number of supplied bytes (= n - offset) is less
+			 *    than the requested count, you will be called
+			 *    again with the requested offset advanced by n.
+			 *    This interface is useful for files no larger
+			 *    than the buffer.
+			 * B) Set *start = a small value (less than buffer!)
+			 *    Put the data of the requested offset at the
+			 *    beginning of the buffer.  Return the number of
+			 *    bytes of data placed there.  If this number is
+			 *    less than the requested count, you will be
+			 *    called again with the requested offset advanced
+			 *    by *start.  This interface is useful when you
+			 *    have a large file consisting of a series of
+			 *    data blocks which you want to count and return
+			 *    as wholes.
+			 *    (hack by Paul.Russell@rustcorp.com.au)
+			 * C) Set *start = a location within the buffer
+			 *    Put the data of the requested offset at *start.
+			 *    Return the number (n) of bytes of data placed
+			 *    there.  If this number is less than the
+			 *    requested count, you will be called again with
+			 *    the requested offset advanced by n.
