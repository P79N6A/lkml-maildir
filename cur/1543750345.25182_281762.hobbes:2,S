Vladimir,
Thank you much for your response.  This is a production email server so 
I had to wait for an appropriate time to shut the system down.
Just a quick summary of what happened.  After rebooting the sever and 
booting from a CD, I ran reiserfsck, which found no corruption in the 
file system.  I then manually checked the directory structure and 
everything looked fine.  I'm not what was wrong, but a reboot apparently 
corrected whatever it was.
I've noticed a couple of patches for reiserfs in the past month or so on 
the LKML.  I'll check after I send this message to see if I can find the 
answer for myself, but, are there any major reiserfs bug fixes related 
to the Linux kernel, which have been corrected since 2.6.9 that I should 
know about?  Also, I'm using a 3ware 8000 series SATA controller, if 
that's at all relevant.
Thanks again for your help,
-- 
Sean
