2.6.16-rc includes patches for proper netfilter IPsec handling. Packets
will now go through the chains once in plain text and once encrypted,
so I guess you're masquerading the packets that should go through the
tunnel to an address that doesn't match the policy anymore and they
are therefore not handled by IPsec (this is also the case my patches
fixed). So you need to make sure you don't have any SNAT rules that
change the unencrypted packets to an address not included in the policy.
