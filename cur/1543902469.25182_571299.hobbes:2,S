Disallowing shared IRQs means disallowing PCI devices in general, so now
you are back to ISA only devices, which it sounds like were the only
things already allowed by vm86 or whatever it was for passing through.
MSI would be good, but how long until all devices support that?
Certainly does appear to have potential though for allowing more
interesting virtual machines.
