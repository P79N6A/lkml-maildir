Because it is correct. Debating that it's now incorrect because it

Agree. Do you test all your conversions? Whole-sale conversions like
this tend to break at least some of the drivers. And that's totally
unacceptable, breaking a working solution because of something that's
not really a bug.

Not if you don't test it.
