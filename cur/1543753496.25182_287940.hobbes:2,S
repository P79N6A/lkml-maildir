I don't know if this is the same thing, or the same issue, but I've
noticed on my Windows machines that the longer my laptop sleeps the
longer it takes for it to wake back up- my guess is that it's doing
exactly this (replaying ticks).  It *really* sucks though because it can
take quite a while for it to come back if it's been asleep for a while.
