At the time, I was more concerned by the very long semaphore hold times I 
was seeing than anything else.  That it helped quite a lot.  It didn't hurt 
throughput in any way I could see, and it improved irman's latency 
numbers.  (process load was routinely hitting ~1.5 seconds max latency at 
the time, that tree cut it to roughly 400-500ms iirc)  Just like anything 
else that increases fairness though, it hurt X feel somewhat in the 
presence of load.
