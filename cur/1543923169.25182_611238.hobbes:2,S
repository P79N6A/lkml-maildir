Of course you're right, just typed faster than thought.
Actually I had to add these two on Fedora, too.

Ok so it seems rev 80 is VT6307 and (at least) rev 46 is VT6306.
I think my googling for lspci reports confirms that.

Interesting, really. Perhaps they aimed at I2C too with 9306 but
screwed up the silicon? Would have to look at the pinout but for
now I'm sick and high fever makes it hard.
It's all consistent, amazingly.

Obviously some values are different than these for my 3 vt6307
(not counting GUID + PCI sub IDs). Though data at 0x20+ is equal.
The last 4 bytes are almost certainly rubbish, that asks the question
if the contents hasn't been changed through some tests, works on
the drivers etc, or if the manufacturer did it right (for example
I somehow managed to clear the GUID on I^2C version before I had the
code to write to it, quite a mystery (writing correct I^2C sequence
for it isn't trivial due to the need of non-all-zeros DEVSEL byte
preceded by the start sequence).
I wonder if the EEPROM has more non-FF data? IIRC the chips addresses
0x80 bytes, or maybe 0x100? I limited it to 0x40 in the code because
the rest is never read by the chip, except if requested by the user.
(For 93c46 the program could read any location directly but I didn't
implement that).

Only one different byte (vs my 6307s) at 0x1B if I see correctly.

Same as mine.

Hmm... They say 6306 only supports 93c46, perhaps I should force
it based on revision.
Or the datasheet doesn't know.

It seems a difference at 0x1e only, that A0 00 at the end - who
knows (would require an analyzer).

I guess chances for the last card are lower.
