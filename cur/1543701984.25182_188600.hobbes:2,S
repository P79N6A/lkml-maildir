The original problem was actually that grub was passing a bogus mem=
parameter to the kernel that was 4K too small, I guess because it was
intending to indicate the amount of "available" memory (the top 4K is
reserved for ACPI).  If highmem had not been enabled, the above code
would have corrected the problem; but with highmem, the computed
low_mem_size was incorrect.  I would say that grub is just broken and
is misusing the mem= parameter, but this has been a problem for years
and they don't seem interested in fixing it.
