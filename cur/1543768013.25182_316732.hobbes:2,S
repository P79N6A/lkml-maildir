You guys REALLY do not see the changed semantics here? You are
changing:
  while (deflate(&stream, 0) == Z_OK)
      stream.next_in = buf;
into
  while (deflate(&stream, 0) == Z_OK)
    ;
  /* Then the data itself.. */
  stream.next_in = buf;
I suspect the results of that tiny bit of code would be slightly
different, especially if "stream.next_in" is volatile, "buf"
is volatile, or if the assignment to next_in has an effect on
the "deflate" operation.
