as far as I remember there is a tiny fix needed to get this working
even for 2.0 kernels; something about the Vesion of the module-interface
that needed to be enclosed within an ifdef for "lower" kernel-versions.
(Sorry, I'm just repeating the problem from memory) - If nobody has done
a working patch for this yet, I coul'd look into this again
With this enhancement, there would even be a minor reason to bump the
version number
