Hello,
I'm back with new code.
This one doesn't work on my sis735 either :-( but after having 
triple-checked my code I don't see why :-((. Time to show the code to 
others...
If someone familiar with pci-ide code could just take a quick look...
The goal is only working ata-100 inits. There's code in sis5513.c that 
could use a little cleanup but I'll wait working ata-100 inits to work 
on that.
You have an edited (commented) diff from original sis5513.c and the real 
patch attached.
A complete new sis5513.c is available for more conveniance at :
