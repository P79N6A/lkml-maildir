Hi,
when genksyms is used on drivers/char/joystick/pcigame.c during "make
dep" it segfaults. There isn't any joystick configuration in the kernel
(it's a plain "make oldconfig" from a fresh kernel copy).
/tmp/linux-2.4.20/drivers/char/joystick$ gcc -Wall -O2 -I/tmp/linux-2.4.20/include  -E -D__GENKSYMS__ pcigame.c| genksyms -p smp_ -k 2.4.20
Segmentation fault
$ genksyms -V       
genksyms version 2.4.25
...
It looks like the segfault is caused by the following line from the gcc
output above:
struct pcigame *((void *)0)
{
        struct pcigame *pcigame;
        int i;
which evaluates from
struct pcigame *pcigame_attach(struct pci_dev *dev, int type)
{
        struct pcigame *pcigame;
        int i;
pcigame_attach(a,b) is defined to NULL in include/linux/pci_gameport.h if
CONFIG_INPUT_PCIGAME{,_MODULE} isn't set (which is the case here).
Fixing this line makes genksyms work. Don't know who's at fault here but
segfaulting doesn't look good...
Adam
