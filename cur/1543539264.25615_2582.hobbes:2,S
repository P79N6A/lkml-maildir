This should be on the Tulip mailing list.  Please follow-up there.

Ahhh, that's the answer.

Note: This will all "just work" with autonegotiation enabled.
I strongly recommend that autonegotiation always be enabled.  If the switch
is doesn't have autonegotiation, or it's broken (Cisco), forgo full duplex
to avoid many future configuration problems.

Leaving autonegotiation set was intentional, but flawed.  It was an effort to
get the transceiver to attempt autonegotiation -- and inform the link
partner of the full duplex setting, before switching to forced-100Mbps.
If you force just force 100Mbps, the link is broken for long enough to clear
the autonegotiation state.

The correction is around line 863.
Note that it fixes two problems.  The code must *clear* the bits first!

You should check your configuration.
A P100 should be able to drive 2-3 100Mbps channels with 'ttcp'.
(Although that was last tested with 2.0.*.)
