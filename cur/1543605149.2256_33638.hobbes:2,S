The following diff was made in 2.4.4.

But it would not prevent the code path 2.4.3-xfs hit.
pdentry is !=NULL and tdentry->d_inode is always NULL after d_alloc():611
Does xfs' child->d_inode->i_op->lookup(child->d_inode, tdentry);
change the contents of tdentry if the lookup("..") succeeds?
Then I suggest:
!       if (!pdentry || tdentry->d_inode == NULL) {
What do you think?
BTW, when does a lookup("..") fail? Even in "/", lookup("..") returns "."
