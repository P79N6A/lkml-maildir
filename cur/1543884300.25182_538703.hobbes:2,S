One possible way to remedy this situation is with __needed and 
__maybe_unneeded.
__needed would be defined to __attribute__ ((used)), which would apply to 
functions only and specify that its code needs to be emitted anyway even 
though it appears to be unreferenced.  This is needed for gcc >=3.4.  In 
gcc <3.4, this gets defined to be __attribute__ ((unused)) to simply 
suppress the warning.  So now all functions that are unreferenced except 
in inline assembly get __needed appended.
__maybe_unneeded would be defined to __attribute__ ((unused)).  It can 
apply to either functions or variables to suppress the warning if they are 
unused.
