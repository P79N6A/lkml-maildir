For anyone interested, I've just put a unified diff patch with
CBMFS v0.4e on my homepage. This one should work, as opposed to my
previous v0.4's... It compiles without warnings (thus it's good), the
computer boots with it compiled into the kernel (thus it's better) and the
filesystem mounts and doesn't oops on cp/ls etc. (thus it's perfect)
Autodetection works (at least for the disk-images I've tried), and the
birds are singing outside my window (ok, that's a lie.)
