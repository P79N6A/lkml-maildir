Maybe one day they might see that having an open source driver, or
even just releasing the hardware interface specifications so that
drivers can be written, will give them an advantage over those who
only have closed source drivers. After all, these companies are in the
business of designing and selling hardware and knowing the interface
specifications (ie the registers and the commands which have to be
sent to them etc) should not give away the layout of the silicon (ie
does not give competitors information about how the commands are
translated to actual operations on the screen). So publishing the
interface should not violate the IP of the silicon design owners.
