It is probably fairly easy to increase the LILO command line to 512 
bytes (including terminator).  Beyond 512 there are complicating factors:
1.  "lilo -R ..." -- the space reserved for the stored command line 
is 1 sector.
2.  configuration option "fallback" -- again 1 sector is the amount reserved.
There are 2 buffers used for the command line.  Since these are 
allocated on sector boundaries, 512 should present no serious problems.
