The notifier patchset that we are discussing here was mostly inspired by 
their work. 
There is no need to restart transfers that you have never started in the 
first place. The remote side would never start a transfer if the page 
reference has been torn down. In order to start the transfer a fault 
handler on the remote side would have to setup the association between the 
memory on both ends again.
