Indeed.  I still intend to clean up those entry points and haven't gotten
to it, so I hadn't bothered with this yet either (though I think I sent it
to you for the backport).  It certainly does bite in practice, e.g. SIGPIPE.
There is a similar failure to take the lock before using zap_other_threads.
I thought I sent this patch before, but it's not in 2.5 yet.

This is outside the part of the code that I've touched lately.
