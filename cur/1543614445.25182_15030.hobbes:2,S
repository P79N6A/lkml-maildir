Hello,
the problem is this:
bios only supports disks up to 32 Gb.
hard disk is 60 Gb.
kernel is 2.4.17
hard disk reports its correct size when reading parameters from the
disk, not from the bios
verd:/proc/ide/hdc# cat geometry
physical     65530/16/63
logical      119150/16/63
when booting (dmesg):
hdc: IC35L060AVER07-0, ATA DISK drive
hdc: 66055247 sectors (33820 MB) w/1916KiB Cache, CHS=119150/16/63,
UDMA(33)
Linux adopts the 'false' geometry (65530/16/63) ) to bypass the bios
boot.
I know that there are patches for 2.2 kernels and 2.3 kernels, so as
linux adopts the logical geometry (a kiddy trick with lba size). They
are very simple (a line), but 2.4 ide implementation is (a little more)
complicated. Any patch?
Bon Nadal - Merry Christmas
