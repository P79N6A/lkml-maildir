For what it's worth, I hit the exact same problem with 2.6.10-rc1-mm1
(failure to get the LVM together at boot, causing a wedge because
my / filesystem is on an LVM), and backing out those two patches has
me up and running.

(Basically, a 24M /boot, a swap, and *two* LVM partitions - I wonder if that
has anything to do with it - it found one and didn't find the other, and gave
up with much complaining). That OS/2 partition is a remnant of what the docs 2
years ago said was needed for suspend-to-disk...
Am also able to test patches if needed...
