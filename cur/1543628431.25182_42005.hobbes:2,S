And Cristoph's point is that Promise has already complied with this exact
section.  The disk they distribute is a driver disk for Caldera Open
Linux.  That disk format happens to require that they put the regular
kernel drivers from the standard install disk into an image and then
simply add their new driver to that image as well.  That means you already
have all the GPL required source on the image you are installing because 
all those kernel modules are bit for bit duplicates of the ones that came 
with your open linux CD.  End of problem.
