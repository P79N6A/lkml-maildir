It's not related to the bug, but prune_icache can jump in at any
time during generic_shutdown_super, except during the invalidate_inodes
runs.  Something like this:
proc1				proc2
generic_shutdown_super
s->s_flags &= ~MS_ACTIVE
invalidate_inodes
put_super
				shrink_icache_memory
				prune_icache
				invalidate_inode_pages
				try_to_release_page
I doubt any FS triggers this.  They would need to generate inodes
with pages during the put_super call, and get them onto the unused list.
But, I think prune_icache should just skip any inodes where the super
doesn't have MS_ACTIVE set.
At any rate, this wasn't the race I was looking for.  Aside from the
bugs fixed by Andrea's patch, we were seeing inodes go negative thanks
to a bad interaction between a latency fix and a backport of something
else from mainline.   Our latency code has a goto again, and mainline
has a big fat comment explaining why goto again isn't needed.  
If the super->s_inodes list was long enough to reschedule in invalidate_list,
we would process the same inodes in multiple times without removing them.
The short version is that no additional patches should be needed for
mainline.
