The perception of many out-of-tree projects is "if I try to get in-tree
I'll be submitted to vicious review, and I'll have to fix the code my
myself, and that's assuming someone bothers to review it at all". What
you've just wrote is no different:

In other words, getting an out-of-tree driver in is a major unrewarding
work commitment for its author (especially considering that if he was
familiar with good kernel coding, chances are he'd have worked in-tree
from the start, with an experimental driver)
Contrast it with "give us a partial NDAed spec and we'll write a driver
from scratch for you".
You're asking way more of people that have a lot less resources than
hardware manufacturers. Many of those projects did try to get in-tree at
least once before giving up.

And when resources were scarce respecting this kind of decision was the
right thing. But if there are enough resources for your offer, I
question letting whole classes of drivers we have documentation for (in
the form of code) out-of-tree (even if that means some less-than-amiable
forking).
Both the OLPC and the N800 have toy (webcam) video capabilities. The
logical next spec (next hardware generation) is stronger video with
remoting (someone will probably sell remote add-ons before).
Are they going to lack in-tree support just because the reference
framework is out-of-tree, and we respect its authors' wishes so much
nothing can happen till they change their mind ?
(And that's assuming they're dead-set on being out-of-tree. Like I wrote
before they're not getting the same deal you're offering to hardware
manufacturers)
Meanwhile you're asking for specs of hardware no Linux user has, because
no form of Linux support ever existed. This is a strange use of
resources.
