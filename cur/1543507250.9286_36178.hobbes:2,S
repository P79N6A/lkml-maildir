Subject: [2.2.11 nitpick patch] USB Mouse naming vague
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This has been irritating me for a while so I ended up making a patch
for it just for consistency sake. :)
The USB mouse section of the USB code links as "mouse.o" which is pretty vague,
especially when you're building a totally modular kernel.
This patch simply renames that section to 'usb-mouse.c' and I'm providing
a modded Makefile for the change. Simply apply the patch and rename mouse.c
in the usb directory to usb-mouse.c and you'll be golden.
Other minor nit: All the USB files use '-' as a seperator but the USB SCSI code
uses '_' as a seperator.
Strange thing I noticed: gpm segfaults unless you insert:
"post-install usb-uhci modprobe -k usb-mouse"
when using modular USB code.
