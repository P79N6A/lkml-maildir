I pass along this exchange for the readers of this list since it appears
to be relevant:
According to Dan Srebnick:
> Thank you again for pointing me towards the newest sysvinit release the

> My results were absolutely terrible.  While the program compiled just
> fine, after installation, my machine became terribly unstable.  It would
> spontaneously reboot at intervals from 10 minutes to several hours.  I

This is the response from miquels@cistron.nl:
This sounds like a kernel problem. A user level program should not
be able to crash the machine. Even if sysvinit _was_ the culprit
(which I doubt) then a reboot is still a kernel bug.
Try backing off to 2.0.36
Mike.
