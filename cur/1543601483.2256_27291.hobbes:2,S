That's just a GREAT log: those are GFP_ATOMIC allocations, all is _more_
than _perfect_ in the above log.

What do you want to do with GFP_ATOMIC? we cannot do anything at the
moment unless you want to make an atomic list that we can free from
atomic context, I thought about something like that but I guess we can
do it after 2.4.11 (possibly in 2.4.x, it doesn't sound a showstopper).

we obviously cannot block with GFP_ATOMIC.
