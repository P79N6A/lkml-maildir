Speaking of dead code: I think you should be able to mostly get rid of
the KERNEL_CALL hack in include/asm-um/unistd.h, since all kernel syscalls
except execve are now gone.
It should be enough to have an out of line version of execve and do
#undef __KERNEL_SYSCALLS
#include "asm/arch/unistd.h"
extern int execve(const char *filename, char *const argv[],
			char *const envp[]);
