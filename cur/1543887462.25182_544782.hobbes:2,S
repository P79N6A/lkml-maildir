No doubt about the goodnes of the SD scheduler, Con did an amazing
work dnd even if we don't know whether SD will be merged in mailine
(CFS seems to be the best candidate) he demonstrated that there is
plenty of room for improvment in that area.
Brad, is it possible for you to do some more test with the latest
version of both SD and CFS  and post some more detailed feedbacks?
That would help a lot.
