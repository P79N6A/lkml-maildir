I'd like to note that I asked people who were actually affected, and had 
examples of their real-world use to step forward and explain their use, 
and that I explicitly mentioned that this is something we can easily 
re-visit.
But I also note that you did no such thing, neither has anybody else.
The fact is, security people *are* insane. You just argue all the time, 
instead fo doing anything productive. So please don't include me in the Cc 
on your insane arguments - instead do something productive and I'm 
interested.
Ok? That was the whole point of LSM in the first place. I'm *not* 
interested in getting roped into your insane arguments. I'm interested in 
moving forward and having real examples of real use and code. Until then, 
this issue is closed. I thought I had made that clear already, but 
apparently not clear enough.
So I repeat: we can undo that commit, but I will damn well not care one 
whit about yet another pointless security model flamewar.
