That would work, but is really a bandaid because we don't know what the
real problem is...  this still smells vaguely like yenta and pci bus
core should be more than just the kissing cousins they are now.  OTOH I
still don't like how much we trust firmware PCI bus setup on x86..
I am pretty lucky on Alpha, we already trust the kernel PCI code
implicitly by unconditionally defining pcibios_assign_all_busses to one.
