Subject: [patch 20/39] [PATCH] hwmon it87: Probe i2c 0x2d only
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/2/27/327

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
Only scan I2C address 0x2d. This is the default address and no IT87xxF
chip was ever seen on I2C at a different address. These chips are
better accessed through their ISA interface anyway.
This fixes bug #5889, although it doesn't address the whole class
of problems. We'd need the ability to blacklist arbitrary I2C addresses
on systems known to contain I2C devices which behave badly when probed.
