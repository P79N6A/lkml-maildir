Well, when you mentioned this I remember a couple of things that I probably
shouldn't have done, that's why it took me so long to answer, I went back 
and
systematically tested different kernels on a test partition and taking 
note of
the hdparm's I used. I've still got a couple of kernels I want to test, so 
I
will post more complete results tomorrow. Still the answer seems to be that
2.4.5 is stable while 2.4.17 is not.
But to answer your question, I downloaded a utility from WD that switches 
the
drive from udma 33 to udma 66, and I then boot linux and type
hdparm -c 1 -d 1 -m 8
Last time before I wrote I also used -X66, but I'm not sure that's a good
idea ...

There is something in vanilla 2.4.17. Using the exact same .config and
filesystem as the one for 2.4.5 it crashes while 2.4.5 remains stable.
OTOH, I've finally managed to have an stable system for a week (I'm
actually using it right now) with 2.4.17. The difference is that
it's got the sis5513.c patch from Lionel Bouton that I found in
the lkml. I'm not using dma yet, though! The driver, as the previous
driver for this chipset, disables everything by default (but even
that didn't help for plain 2.4.17) That's what I'm going to test next,
using the above mentioned hdparm line.
