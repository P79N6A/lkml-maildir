Yes, I will.

Well, it's somewhat of a cop out as well :*).  The cpus within 0 <= cpu < nr_cpu_ids
are printed with a cpulist_scnprintf.  This is printed for all architectures
and shows primarily cpus that either have been offlined via CPU HOTPLUG or
made possible by extending the number of "possible" cpus via a kernel start
parameter.
Those cpus that may actually be present in the system but their index exceeds
NR_CPUS/maxcpus are printed following the above and are appended to the list. 
If the list is non-empty, a comma is inserted first.  This keeps it all within
the syntax needed by cpulist_parse().  This is only done for x86 right now.
I'll put this info in the doc file.

Almost, but not quite.  You can mine the syslog file to find if there's a
warning message but otherwise, "extra" cpus are silently ignored.

Thanks!
