I applied Oliver & Alan Cox's patches to the 2.4.24 kernel, and am still
seeing hangs when copying large amounts of data over USB on IBM systems
containing two EHCI controllers (Intel 82801EB).
 
I see similar errors to the ones Lucas Postupa had in the kernel logs :
 
Buffer I/O error on device sda1, logical block 134522 lost page write due to
I/O error on sda1
 
Unloading the EHCI driver, and reverting to 1.1 speeds, does not solve the issue.
