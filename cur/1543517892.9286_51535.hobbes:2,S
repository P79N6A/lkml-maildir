Please see my latest patch, I now no longer mess with keyboard.c,
which is common for all kbd architectures - just with pc_keyb.c.  I
tried to put a printk, but it will be generated in some other places,
other than real glitches, like: press shift, press A, allow it to
repeat, then release the shift, now a will continue to repeat.  The
result is smth like:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
well, between the first A and the second the delay is enforced, but
also between the first a and the second one...  Which is not
disturbing, IMHO, but is not a loggable event either...  Forget about
the printk for the time being and plese use my latest patch - it is
really better, guards arrow keys and others, etc.  That I really think 
that might find its way into the kernel main tree, but this one, in
keyboard.c - would not...
