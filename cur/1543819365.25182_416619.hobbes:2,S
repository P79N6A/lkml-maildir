I thought one of the requirements for accepting a patch into -stable
was that it was already in mainline.  Was this a change in policy that
I missed, or just an oversight when we vetted these patches?
Not that I have anything against these patches, just curious in the
future if we should NACK patches proposed for -stable if we notice
that they aren't yet in mainline.
