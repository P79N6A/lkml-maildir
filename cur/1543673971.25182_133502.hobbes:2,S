           Summary: Battery info/status query called twice through /proc
                    interface
    Kernel Version: 2.4.21-rc/acpi 2002-04-24
            Status: NEW
          Severity: normal
             Owner: andrew.grover@intel.com
         Submitter: markus@gaugusch.at
Problem Description:
The acpi code is executed twice when doing 'cat /proc/acpi/BAT1/info' (same with
'state'). I added debug printk's to the appropriate functions to find this out.
