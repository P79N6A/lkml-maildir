Hi, Roland!

Good. I was also curious and just checked again. The watchdog subsystem
is by default _disabled_ in the kernel configuration. If you use some
distro's kernel, where they turned it on, complain to them!
If you turned it on yourself, you are really on your own...
the Kconfig help there is IMO sufficient and very clear and,
"If unsure, say N". Hmm... sorry?!

I guess I understand your position. But I don't see no way to improve
the kernel in that point.
Complain to the guys who enabled the watchdog / setup this trap for
any reason.

That's one possible way of "learning by doing suicide (tm);"

Read some details about watchdogs to get more background and why the
watchdog is triggered so easily and why it's good this way.
