Well... VAXen use physical PTEs for 512 byte pages, Linux uses 8
consecutive pages to simulate 4K pages.
On top of that, some of today's machines have configurable page sizes.
Besides that, 512 byte sectors are quite a clever thing: Drives
probably can write a number of consecutive sectors, so if you want to
send a page, just send eight sectors.

Uh? This should be transparent to the host computer, so logical sector
numbers won't change.
