This discussion was kicked off by an unconditional spin (512 tries)
against mutex_trylock in the btrfs tree locking code.
Btrfs is using mutexes to protect the btree blocks, and btree searching
often hits hot nodes that are always in cache.  For these nodes, the
spinning is much faster, but btrfs also needs to be able to sleep with
the locks held so it can read from the disk and do other complex
operations.
For btrfs, dbench 50 performance doubles with the unconditional spin,
mostly because that workload is almost all in ram.
For 50 procs creating 4k files in parallel, the spin is 30-50% faster.
This workload is a mixture of disk bound and CPU bound.
Yes, there is definitely some low hanging fruit to tune the btrfs btree
searches and locking.  But, I think the adaptive model is a good fit for
on disk btrees in general.
