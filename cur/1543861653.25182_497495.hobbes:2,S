- Please Cc: netdev@vger.kernel.org, jeff@garzik.org and the maintainer
  of the driver (Gary Zambrano <zambrano@broadcom.com> as per MAINTAINERS
  file and the log of the driveri).
- the dev_err() message fits completely on a 80 columns line.
- request-irq is not checked a few lines below either.
It would be nice to avoid the free_irq/pci_disable_device dance altogether.
