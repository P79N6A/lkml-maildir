That is _so_ not my call.
Right now, the version in linux-kernel is the master.  I'm not saying that 
should be the case, I'm just saying it is.  That's why I'm pushing patches 
that way rather than recommending anyone else use the version I cleaned up in 
toybox (which is currently fairly standalone).
If somebody wants to break it out and maintain it as a separate project, fine 
with me, just tell me where I should look and where to send patches.  But if 
the linux kernel doesn't actually start _using_ said external version, and 
instead maintains its own, the external version will go the way of libsysfs 
when udev went "a shared library means we include it in our source tree and 
build our own copy".
