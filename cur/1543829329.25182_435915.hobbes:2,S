vmstat gives the same #s as top, and it doesn't
break down the interrupts, so its not the answer
to the question "is there something similar to
systat". Plus its clear that the guy who gave the
answer doesn't know what he's talking about,
since he's actually trying to explain away the
problem as being normal. 
Here's a sensible bug report. Bridging 75K pps.
vmstat output:
 0  0      0 425424   9984  40496    0    0     0
    0 16238    12  0  0 100  0
 0  0      0 425424   9984  40496    0    0     0
    0 16227    16  0  0 100  0
 0  0      0 425424   9984  40496    0    0     0

Over 16,000 interrupts per second and 100% idle. 
netstat:
eth2   1500   0       5      0      0      468886
     0      0      0 BMRU
eth3   1500   473201      0   5680      0       5
     0      0      0 BMRU
the system is perpetually 100% idle but its
dropping packets due to excessive backlog.
