Some userspace software uses "short" for PIDs. Bash did this.

Oh, the horror!
Consider, do you like to type "kill 1234567890" more than
a simple "kill 1234"?
What do you think of "ps -efj" on a standard 80x24 screen?
The limit should be 9999 by default, because this keeps the
numbers conveniently small. If you really need more processes
than that, going to 65000 or 99999 might be reasonable.

Gee, another reason to keep the limit low.

There should not be any significant security advantages.
One can easily wrap/predict in a 31-bit space.
