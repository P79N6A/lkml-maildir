It should be probably a kmem_cache_alloc() instead of a kmalloc
in the first place anyways. This would reduce fragmentation.

Looks mostly good to me.

You didn't describe that change, but unless it's clear the separate cache lines
are a win I would not do it and save memory again. Was this split based on
actual measurements or more theoretical considerations?
