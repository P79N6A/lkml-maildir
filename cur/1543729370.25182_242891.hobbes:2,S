I have a 2.4.19 Kernel from SuSE running the bonding driver. I can see that
the bonding driver is switching over to the standby bonded interface for no
"apparent" reason. I have a couple of questions.
Namely,
Are there any patches to the bonding driver?
What would cause a bonded interface to be switched over?
I am also seeing duplex packets being caused by this. Is this known
behavior?
Please CC me directly on any response.
Regards,
Jack
