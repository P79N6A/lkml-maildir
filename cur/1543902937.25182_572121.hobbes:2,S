Hrm, I still think it's kind of interesting to see what happens there.
So the sane way to make sure it's fixed would be to turn the macros
free_page_and_swap_cache() and free_pages_and_swap_cache() into an
inline function (just to make sure the compiler complains), but that
would require to include linux/pagemap.h from linux/swap.h. But let's
just see what happens on sparc if we include linux/pagemap.h from
swap.h.
I just tested compiling on sparc, here is the result:

PageHighMem is declared in linux/page-flags.h, which is included in
linux/mm.h with the following comment:
/*
 * FIXME: take this include out, include page-flags.h in
 * files which need it (119 of them)
 */
#include <linux/page-flags.h>
(linux/mm.h is included from linux/highmem.h)
Actually, we get a circular inclusion there:

                 from /home/compudj/git/linux-2.6-lttng/include/linux/pagemap.h:10,

                 from /home/compudj/git/linux-2.6-lttng/init/main.c:49:
mm.h includes asm-sparc/pgtable.h includes linux/swap.h includes
linux/pagemap.h (which I have added myself) includes linux/highmem.h
includes mm.h.....
Is it me or it all looks like a fubarish mess ? :(
Why is asm-sparc/pgtable.h including linux/swap.h ? Perharps the sparc
devs will be able to enlighten us...
