I don't see why read/write are special, "normal" filesystems don't
need the file descriptor in that case either.
And other in BSD's, OS X, the read/write fs ops don't get the open
file, and their fuse implementations have to hack around this.
The exact same thing is true for the other operations on file
descriptors, just in those cases Linux does the same as the other
OS's.

No, it's special, because it does not do permission checking, while
truncate() does.

What about sshfs.  Basically it uses the sftp protocol, which more or
less implements the UNIX API in a remote protocol.
So it has OPEN, READ, WRITE, CLOSE, STAT, FSTAT, etc. operation.  Now
why is FSTAT different than READ or WRITE?
