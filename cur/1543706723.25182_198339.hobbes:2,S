I'm thinking about many scripts in the wild, and my own scripts (usually) handle spaces
well, but it's awkward sometimes although quoting usually resolves the issue (never mind what
happens with filenames with quotes, newlines and other garabage, but even those work sometimes. 
Fortunately these are rare, very rare and usually the result of a programming mistake elsewhere :-)
On the command line there is no problem. 
With other script languages I use this is rarely an issue.
