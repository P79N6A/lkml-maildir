I don't think that's going to happen.  If we did this for your obscure system,
then we'd have to do it for every obscure system, and before you know it, the
kernel is 200KB larger.
Besides, why is your client afraid of patched kernels?  It sounds like a very
odd request from someone with a linuxcare.com email address.  I would think that
you'd WANT to provide patched kernels so that the customer can keep paying you
(until they learn how to use a text editor, at which point they can patch the
kernel themselves!!!)
