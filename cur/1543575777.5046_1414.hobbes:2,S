   I've been having weird problems with 2.4 kernels ip networking. I
   can't connect to several sites ( hotmail.com,intel.com... ). After
   some investigation with tcpdump I figured that the IDentification
   field of every outgoing ip packet is set to zero and then it
   doesn't get through some few firewalls. I'm surprised I haven't
   found anything about it in the list archives, so I'm trying to get
   help here. Did I forget to configure something?
No, the sites have firewalls erroneously blocking ECN, try:
echo "0" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn
