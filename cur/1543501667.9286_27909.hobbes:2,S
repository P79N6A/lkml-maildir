Alan,
The following patch allows the Panasonic DVD-RAM
to function in read-write mode.   It doesn't work with
ext2fs since the hardware sector size is 2048 bytes, but
it does work with mkisofs blah blah >/dev/sdb and whatever
other filesystems may work with 2048 byte hardware sectors.
I have successfully copied three DVDs with this drive to the
ram media, mounted the copy and played back the movies from the
mounted copies (yes, they were all unencrypted).
I've also used mkisofs and created a 2GB filesystem on the
DVD-RAM which mounted properly and had no problems.  I was able
to overwrite the isofs with yet another dvd copy (unencrypted).
The proper patch is probably to change the architecture of the
whole sd/sr/st layer.   It seems sorely in need of rewrite.
