Thanks Christoph. I incorporated this into my latest patchset. It does
seem to fix the issue (tested by bouncing NFS up and down for 30 mins
or so). Let me know if you want me to add a signed-off-by line for
you...

Yep -- It's ugly. I took a look a while back at what it would take to
change that. The problem is that it's very difficult to tell exactly
what the BKL is intended to protect in. I assume it does it for the same
reason that fs/locks.c uses it, but there may be other things that need
protection if it's removed.
It might be best to try to change this incrementally -- gradually audit
and move pieces of lockd() outside of the BKL, until it's clear that
it's no longer needed.
