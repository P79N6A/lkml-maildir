Subject: [PATCH] PCIe ASPM causes machine (HP Compaq 6735s) to sometimes freeze hard at boot at PCI initialization time
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
This is intended for review by someone with more PCI experience, first.
If it is considered as safe as I think it is :), it would be great if
this can be picked up ang go into stable kernels as well if the
feedback is positive (just checked with .25, the patch still
patches there, even without offset).
Thanks,
    Thomas
PCIE: Break out of endless loop waiting for PCI config bits to switch
Makes a Compaq 6735s boot reliably again which hang in the loop
on some boots.
