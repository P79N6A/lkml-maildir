Hi David,
 last message on this issue for today. By inserting printk's I could
show that the packets from the "external" Ganglia/gmond clients never
show up in the "udp_rcv" routine when running the 2.4.22 kernel. So it
seems something goes amiss when receiving certain UDP packets.
 Unfortunatelly this exhausts my clues about the dataflow of ipv4. Next
question from me would be who calls "udp_rcv", or would such call be
dispatched from the inet_protos table.
Cheers
Martin
