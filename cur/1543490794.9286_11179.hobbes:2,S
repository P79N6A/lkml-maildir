I recently posted a message related to a making problem on the linux
kernel 2.0.27
I upgrade to a new version(well not such a big improvement on the
upgrade, but...who cares :)) to a RH5.0
kernel 2.0.30 and i tried to remake the kernel and i get the same error
that i have received on the 2.0.27.
Isn't weird i get the same problem on two different kernel versions.
I make  paste of the first message to explain the problem...
Regards...

Greetings,
 I have a problem making a linux kernel on a i586 machine.
When i type: make zImage, the makefile fails to link the object files
related to the image file compression(misc.o,piggy.c... located at
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/compressed) and then abort the whole
making process.
I get 3 messages about undefined references in misc.o in function
fill_inbuff.
There are only 2 variables on that function that are undefined, but ld
reply with 3 messages since one of that variables appears two times
within the fucntion.
I take a look on the source code of misc.c and try to see where the
variables are declared, and they are declared as follow:
extern char input_data;
extern int input_len;
These are the variables that the linker complains about.
I am using a RH5.0 , kernel 2.0.30 and a i586 platform.
Any ideas about this problem?
Thanks,
Carlos Sousa - c9702056@cca.fc.up.pt
