So..  the problem which we're fixing here is only present when someone
use kernelcore=.  This is in fact an argument for _not_ merging the
horrible-hack.
How commonly do we expect people to specify kernelcore=?  If "not much" then
it isn't worth adding the __alloc_pages() overhead?
(It's a pretty darn small overhead, I must say)
