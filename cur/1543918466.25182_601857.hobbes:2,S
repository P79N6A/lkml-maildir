Subject: [PATCH 29/51] [GFS2] panic after can't parse mount arguments
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Abhijith Das <adas@redhat.com>
When you try to mount gfs2 with -o garbage, the mount fails and the gfs2
superblock is deallocated and becomes NULL. The vfs comes around later
on and calls gfs2_kill_sb. At this point the hidden gfs2 superblock
pointer (sb->s_fs_info) is NULL and dereferencing it through
gfs2_meta_syncfs causes the panic. (the other function call to
gfs2_delete_debugfs_file() succeeds because this function already checks
for a NULL pointer)
