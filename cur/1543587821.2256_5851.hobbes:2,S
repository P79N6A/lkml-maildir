I guess I was confusing what the spec said with the way in which I chose to
comply with the spec.  I calculate overruns (I know when a timer went off, and
how many of its intervals have passed since it went off by by 
time_since_expire/interval) and don't reinsert until return from the signal
handler.  
this prevents a flood of high frequency interrupts inherently and allows
processing of the signal handlers to proceed cleanly.
