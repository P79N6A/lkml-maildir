The Adaptec card can share interrupts, but it is not wise to do that with
another card that is going to be a high priority interrupt.  You most likely
need to change the motherboard bios settings.  If you are not using your
onboard IDE you can disable that freeing up another high priority interrupt.
Otherwise you can manually assign the interrupts through the bios.
