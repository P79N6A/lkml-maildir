Looks very reasonable to me and your explaination is much better than
mine was :-)

Because right now we know the *only* port that needs a release method
is UML I wonder if we could do save a couple of bytes & cycles for
everyone else by doing something like #ifdef CONFIG_IRQ_HAS_RELEASE,
#endif around that and then letting the Kconfig magic set
CONFIG_IRQ_HAS_RELEASE as required?  If other arches need it thay can
do the same and if eventually almost everyone does we can kill the
#ifdef crud?
Longer term I wonder if some of the irq mechanics in UML couldn't end
up being a bit more like the s390 stuff too?
