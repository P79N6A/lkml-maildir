He's talking about cases where we want the behaviour to be
work-conserving, whilst still offering guarantees in the event of
contention. e.g. cgroups A and B each get a 20% guarantee on the TX
path if they need it, but anyone can use any otherwise-idle bandwidth.
(This is relatively straightforward to set up from userspace with the
standard Linux traffic control tools).

But this issue (traffic control for cgroups) is too complex to be
described by a simple API. Any simple API you choose to try to
describe the limiting directly will be insufficient for a good number
of the potential users. Better to just provide a (very simple) API to
hook into the existing (complex) traffic control API and leave the
tricky stuff to userspace, where anyone can construct arbitrarily
complex queueing schemes with a shell script and a few calls to "tc".
