I would seriously recommend to intel to consider NOT doing this. Binary
only modules 
are generally frowned upon and there is (almost) never a good reason for
doing
them. If you're concerned about firmware, that's a totally different
issue,
binary firmware images can be done in a much simpler way.
But PLEASE don't do such a binary only module; I thought Intel was more 
Open Source friendly than that. (And I know most parts of Intel are; the
CPU folks and the networking folks are VERY helpful)
For one, almost no Linux distribution will ship with your drivers so
customers 
have go to a lot of hassle to compile their own drivers, and by doing
that
they loose all support from the community.
