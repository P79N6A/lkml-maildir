> This patch creates a tmpfs mount option and adds code which causes
> tmpfs allocations to be interleaved across the nodes of a NUMA machine.
> This is useful in situations where a large tmpfs file would otherwise
> consume most of the memory on a single node, forcing tasks running on
> that node to perform off-node allocations for other (i.e. non-tmpfs)
> memory needs.

> Tightly synchronized HPC applications with large (on the order of

> of a type of application which benefits from this change.  Other
> types of workloads may prefer local tmpfs allocations, thus a mount
> option is provided.

> The new mount option is "interleave=", and defaults to 0.  Any non-zero
> setting turns on interleaving.  Interleaving behavior can be changed

Looks good to me, though I don't really know that area of code very well.
Hopefully Hugh or someone can give it a better review.
Thanks for doing that,
M.
