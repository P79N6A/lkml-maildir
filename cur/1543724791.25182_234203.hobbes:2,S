There are cases where you have to use priority inheritance, but the schemes that are
typically used either have a kind of exhaustive analysis backing it or uses a simple
late detection scheme. In a general purpose OS, the latter is useful for various kind
of overload cases. But if your system is constantly using that specific case, then it's
a sign the contention in the kernel must *also* be a problem under SMP conditions. The
constant use of priority inheritance overloads the scheduler, puts pressure on the
cache and other negative things that hurt CPU local performance of the system.
The reason why I mention this is because of Linux's hand-crafted nature of dealing
with this. These are basically contention problems expressed in a different manner.
The traditional Linux method is the correct method of deal with this in a general
purpose OS. This also applies to application structure as well. The use of these
mechanisms need to be thought out before application.

The nature these kind of applications push into a very demanding space where
typical methodologies surrounding the use of threads goes out the window. Pushing
both the IO and CPU resources of a kernel is the common case and often you have to
roll your own APIs, synchronization mechanisms to deal with these problem. Simple
Posix API and traditional mutexes are a bit too narrow in scope to solve these
cross system concurrency problems. It's not trivial stuff at all and can span
from loosely to tightly coupled systems, yes, all for pro-audio/video.
Posix and friends in these cases simply aren't good enough to cut it.

Yes and no. This really all really needs to be hard real time in the long run.
With things like Tivo and other embedded application putting high demand on kernel
resources this kind of stuff needs to go into the Linux kernel sooner rather than
later so that Linux can keep up with current industry tracks.
That's my two cents. :)
