Hi,
Fairsched is a hierarchical fair CPU scheduler. Processes are divided
into groups and each group receives guaranteed CPU time allocation
proportional to its weight. The standard scheduler is used to schedule
processes within a group. It can be used to divide CPU time fairly
among users or for more flexible CPU time allocation on busy compute
servers. Kernel patch, documentation and a testing utility can be
found at:

New since v0.10:
- ported to 2.3.34
- system call numbers changed on alpha, arm, i386, m68k
Regards,
Borislav
