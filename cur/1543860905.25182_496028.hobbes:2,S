Actually, there seems to be missing infrastructure for this:
  CC [M]  drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.o
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c: In function 'lpfc_pci_probe_one':
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c:1418: warning: implicit declaration of function 'pci_select_bars'
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c:1422: warning: implicit declaration of function 'pci_request_selected_regions'
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c:1734: warning: implicit declaration of function 'pci_release_selected_regions'
Is there any ETA on the rest of the infrastructure?
