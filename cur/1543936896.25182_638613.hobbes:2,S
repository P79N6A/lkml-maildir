While I would love to do this, it's not that simple.
Some of our hardware is not supported on mainline, so we need per-kernel 
version patches to even bring up the blade.  The blades netboot via a 
jumbo-frame network, so kernel extensions are needed to handle setting 
the MTU before mounting the rootfs.  The blade in question uses CKRM 
which doesn't exist for newer kernels so the problem may simply be 
hidden by scheduling differences.  The userspace application uses other 
kernel features that are not in mainline (and likely some of them won't 
ever be in mainline--I know because I've tried).
Basically, the number of changes required for our environment makes it 
difficult to just boot up the latest kernel.
