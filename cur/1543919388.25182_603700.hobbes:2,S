markus,
its the same old story you are telling over and over again.
of course there might be a huge community builded up the
last month @ mcentral,
of course your driver supports newer devices,
BUT
the same old story is - and you always miss that part
we discussed a lot on your changes and also ACCEPTED those
for merging, if you would have changed your UNNECCESSARY touching
of dvb-core. its proven that things could work without that
nacked change to dvb core. but, you decided to stop discussion then,
and went away to perform your own tree/userspace thing.
as linus and andrew stated within this thread they think they will not 
merge your code like it is cause of different reasons,
i am wondering a bit whats your next step is.
regards
marcel
ps. as linus tells from time to time
"It's not just black and white - there's also grey"
