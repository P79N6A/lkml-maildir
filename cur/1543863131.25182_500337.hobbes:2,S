OK I see your point. While trying to show why I got you wrong, I in fact
demonstrated to myself that you were right :-)
For instance, let's say we have 500 MB cache at 1000 MB/s and a write out
threshold of 80% with a disk at 100 MB/s. Writing 1000 MB would produce
this pattern :
  time     data sent   written    dirty data
  in sec    from dd    to disk     in cache
   0.0        0 MB        0 MB        0 MB
   0.4      400 MB        0 MB      400 MB  -> writeout starts
   1.0      560 MB       60 MB      500 MB
   5.4     1000 MB      500 MB      500 MB  -> dd leaves.
  10.4     1000 MB     1000 MB        0 MB  -> write terminated.
-> avg dd   speed = 1000/5.4 = 185 MB/s
   avg disk speed = 1000/10.4 = 96 MB/s
Now with a lower writeout threshold of 2% (10 MB) :
  time     data sent   written    dirty data
  in sec    from dd    to disk     in cache
   0.0        0 MB        0 MB        0 MB
   0.01      10 MB        0 MB       10 MB  -> writeout starts
   1.0      599 MB       99 MB      500 MB
  5.01     1000 MB      500 MB      500 MB  -> dd leaves.
 10.01     1000 MB     1000 MB        0 MB  -> write terminated.
-> avg dd   speed = 1000/5.01 = 199.6 MB/s
   avg disk speed = 1000/10.01 = 99.9 MB/s
At least, numbers are not that much different to justify a one to two speed
ratio on the VAIO. The difference being caused by cache speed, it's clearly
possible that his RAM is definitely very very slow which would then explain
the difference.

Indeed, that's what makes the whole difference. I was used to cap the amount
of buffers, but the behaviour here is different.
Thanks for your insight !
