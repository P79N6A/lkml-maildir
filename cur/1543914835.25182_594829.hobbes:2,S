There's no need to CC all those FSF people on this as I'm sure  
they're plenty busy with other things, have lots of people to dispel  
FUD for them, and certainly don't need the excess email in their  
inboxes.

Well you seem to have CCed the linux kernel mailing list, so I am  
talking about the linux kernel sources, not stuff hosted on  
madwifi.org or other places as I have no knowledge or control over  
what those maintainers accept or do not accept.  If you aren't  
talking about the Linux kernel itself then you should get your  
flamewar off this list as nobody here cares.

I see these very out-of-date URLs showing people making changes to  
some already-problematic licenses in various files in some other non- 
linux-kernel repository.  Please note that the Linux kernel does  
*NOT* contain an atheros driver right now!  Therefore this doesn't  
seem to be the patch posted to LKML I was talking about:

The "madwifi" site is not a linux-kernel branch at *all*.  The stuff  
that gets imported there is totally under the control of the madwifi  
people and if you want to gripe about copyright *they* are the people  
you should be griping to.  It's like complaining to the OpenBSD  
developers about copyright issues in some code that NetBSD developers  
commit to their repository; it just plain doesn't make sense.

For starters, I seem to have plenty of references to "the facts" as  
cited above.  You even deleted 3 major references from the email you  
were *replying* to!
Secondly, what the HELL is with you guys and the personal  
attacks?!?!?  You said I am "hopelessly misinformed, or a habitual  
liar"???  You very carefully snipped out the 3 examples I gave where  
people were describing how the Linux kernel did the right thing both  
legally and ethically so you could make those claims?  Seriously, if  
you really want to know what went on as far as the Linux Kernel and  
the LKML is concerned, please go read the endless LKML archives on  
this particular topic and stop bringing up this topic over and over  
again with a few thousand people who didn't do anything wrong and  
don't care about that code at all.
If you want to know what the real upstream sources contain they're  
all publicly available for purview at:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/
 
linux-2.6.git;a=summary
I'm really getting tired of these endless streams of emails which  
show up with a new thread every few days containing 95% insults and  
flamage and I'm going to completely ignore anything further related  
to atheros/licensing/etc since virtually all of the people sending  
emails to the LKML can't seem to have a reasonable conversation.  Plonk.
Cheers,
Kyle Moffett
