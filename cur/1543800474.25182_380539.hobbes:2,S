small update:
using tvtime and i put a heavy load on the system there are still no
random crashes or freezes happened.
I've found many reports that xawtv might cause system instability, some
say with overlay others say grabdisplay (in my case grabdisplay). But
when i use overlay mode in xawtv then i cannot get a real fullscreen.
Tried all the recommended parameters to xawtv to get it to real
fullscreen but somehow it doesn't, only in grabdisplay. Now i'm using
tvtime and things work perfect (unless i'm speaking too early, but i'll
leave it also for the whole night running a heavy load + tv on anyway)
I hope some one can comment on these issue's and especially if the bttv
code has to do with all this ?
