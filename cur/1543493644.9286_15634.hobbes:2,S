why not pE=pP initially, and let the 'smart' program continue to
manipulate pE as it desires?

I just want to keep our implementation fairly spartan, without much
clutter.  fE just doesn't look very useful to me, and especially not for
security purposes.  As Andrej Presern pointed out, an exploit can
trivially raise all effective to match permitted anyway.

Certainly!  That's the whole point of the way inheritable passes between
processes.  I'm just saying that, in looking at designing a secure system
around caps, there are many cases where I _don't_ want inheritance to pass
in the usual fashion.  Some programs just have no business exec'ing
another process and giving it elevated privs.  Running named, mountd,
imapd, portmap, etc with pI=(mostly full) makes them just as vulnerable to
buffer overflow exploits as before; i.e., they could exec /bin/sh and get
a shell with mostly raised pI=='root shell'.  So by including an fM, I can
prevent programs from getting a full pI when they don't need it.  This,
IMHO, is perfectly in line with the principle of least priviledge.

Right, but 'more' has no business having CAP_SETFCAP in it's pI under
_any_ circumstances.  (well, none legitimate that I can think of)  So
having CAP_SETFCAP in it's pI is a pretty big priviledge that we currently
have no good method for removing.

I'm only talking about privs that have no business whatsoever being passed
on in the inheritable set.  If a distribution maintainer masks out a priv
that is legitimately _needed_ by sub-processes, that's their own fault,
and easily correctable.

Well, I've tried to illustrate a broad class of problems that appear to
require the solution I've suggested.  I can certainly _see_ what you're
talking about here, but I can't think of any good examples that would
cause any real problems.  If this is really a corner case you're talking
about here, it may be best solved in other ways (patching the program,
since not error-checking is an obvious bug).  I'm just thinking it's not
efficient to store this extra info if <1% of cap-enabled programs really
need it.  On the other hand, the abscence of fM seems to require patching
a _lot_ of programs to make them capability-aware.

OK, this 'future-proofing' is something I haven't really given much
thought to, but I can see how it could become an issue.  I'll try to think
about this today some.

Well, I can see the need for quite a few files in /proc/... to tune
default behavior; and this is fairly cheap.
cheers,
