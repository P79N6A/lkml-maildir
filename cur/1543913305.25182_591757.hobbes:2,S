And lguest.  I can't tell until I've actually implemented it, but I
think it will seriously reduce the need for page pinning which is why
only root can currently launch guests.
My concern is locking: this is called with the page lock held, and I
guess we have to bump the guest out if it's currently running.
(Oh, and this means lguest needs to do a reverse mapping somehow, but
I'll come up with something).
Cheers,
Rusty.
