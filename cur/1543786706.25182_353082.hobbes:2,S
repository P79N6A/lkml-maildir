Subject: [PATCH] ioc4_serial: Remove bogus error message
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

This change removes a bogus error message from the IOC4 serial driver
interrupt handler.
This error message is bogus for two reasons.  First, it can never occur
given that current code takes care to initialize IOC4 in such a way that
these "unknown" interrupts could never occur.   Second, this code fails
to take into account that other drivers can share the IOC4 interrupt
mechanism through SA_SHIRQ, and thus this driver is not in-fact "all-knowing".
Finally, this error message triggers every time some "unknown" interrupt
occurs -- it's not rate limited or repetition limited in any way,
thereby effectively denying use of the console device.  Given its
bogosity in the first place, it's best to just get rid of it entirely.
