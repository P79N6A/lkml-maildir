Subject: [PATCH] Compile kernel with GCC-3.5 and without regparm
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi.
I tried to build the kernel with my CVS GCC-3.5 compiler today, and had
all sorts of failures about prototypes not matching. My configuration
had not selected the 'CONFIG_REGPARM' option, so the new '-mregparm=3'
flag wasn't passed to the compiler. That's fine, but the problem is the
FASTCALL macro is unconditionally defined to add an regparm(3)
attribute, making the compiler quite confused. The following small patch
conditionally defines FASTCALL, and allowed my compilation to succeed
either with or without the CONFIG_REGPARM conditional being defined.
I tested this patch by configuring a kernel without the CONFIG_REGPARM
flag, then started the build. Once the build got through building a
couple of files in 'arch/i386/kernel' that had failed previously, I
stopped the build. A cleanup and reconfiguration with the CONFIG_REGPARM
conditional followed, and a new build began. Again, the files in the
same directory compiled fine, so things looked good. I then tried to
build with CONFIG_REGPARM defined and setting CC and HOSTCC to use
my gcc-2.95 compiler, and the files in that directory compiled again
successfully once more.
If this patch is deemed correct, a similar patch for 'asm-um' is
likely necessary as well.
