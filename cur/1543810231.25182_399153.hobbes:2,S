I don't think there's any other way to proceed.  For each version, you
should carefully note down the feedback that you received and how you
are responding to each suggestion, and include that with the patch
file.  But it's too much to expect for people to keep context for a
patch under review, so even though it generates a lot of email, I
think that including the whole series is the only way to go.
Perhaps the list admins disagree with me though ;)
