Having the VFS allocate objects by passing in object sizes in structs is
ugly to the extreme.  So I have similar objections as Al here.
The API change as I have implemented things is more flexible.  Having
the fs perform the kmem cache allocation for its inodes is much more
clean than your version IMHO, and one of the big reasons why I did
things this way.  If you dislike the size of ext2_alloc_inode some of
that code can probably go into a helper macro/function.

I am very much interested in a better solution...  I could not figure
out how to get a private pointer from a struct inode*, without using a
nasty OFFSET_OF macro or a pointer to self as I implemented.
