I was not advocating for that, if you read carefully. The fact that epoll 
does not do that, should be a clear hint. The old /dev/epoll IIRC was only 
10% faster than the current epoll under an *heavy* event frequency 
micro-bench like pipetest (and that version of epoll did not have the 
single pass over the ready set optimization). And /dev/epoll was 
delivering events *directly* on userspace visible (mmaped) memory in a 
zero-copy fashion.

Those *other* (tons?!?) interfaces can be created *when* the need comes 
(see Linus signalfd [1] example to show how urgent that was). *When* 
the need comes, they will work with existing POSIX interfaces, without 
requiring your own just-another event interface. Those other interfaces 
could also be more easily adopted by other Unix cousins, because of 
the fact that they rely on existing POSIX interfaces. One of the reason 
about the Unix file abstraction interfaces, is that you do *not* have to 
plan and bloat interfaces before. As long as your new abstraction behave 
in a file-fashion, it can be automatically used with existing interfaces. 
And you create them *when* the need comes.
