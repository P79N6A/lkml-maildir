I understand one still has to write a kernel driver to shut up the irq.  
How about writing a small bytecode interpreter to make event than 
unnecessary?
The userspace driver would register a couple of bytecode programs: 
is_interrupt_pending() and disable_interrupt(), which the uio framework 
would call when the interrupt fires.
The bytecode could reuse net/core/filter.c, with the packet replaced by 
the mmio or ioregion, or use something new.
