Hi Folks,
I compiled the latest version of the kernel
2.6.0-test1.
I was able to successfully build the bzImage , but I
am not able to boot using this new kernel.
My Machine just stops after displaying the following
    "Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel "
Nothing happens after this message, it just hangs
Please assist me in solving this, I am very keen on to
testing this kernel.
Configuration of my machine :
CPU  AMD Athlon 1800+ XP 
Motherboard ASUS KT266  
RAM  256MB
HDD  20GB
with ATI Rage128 AGP card
Thanks in advance.
Manjunathan Padua Y
