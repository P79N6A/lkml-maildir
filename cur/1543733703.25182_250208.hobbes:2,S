at a quick glance your patch doesnt seem to cover the following locking
primitives: read_lock_irqsave(), read_lock_irq(), write_lock_irqsave,
write_lock_irq(). Also, i think your 2.6.6 patch doesnt apply anymore
because it clashes with your very nice out-of-line spinlocks patch that
went into -BK recently ;)
anyway, the preempt-smp.patch is a complete and systematic solution that
has been tested, measured and traced quite heavily.
