just a little note about kerneltop...
'kerneltop' is similar to 'top', but shows only kernel function usage
(modules not included).
I have updated it a bit (now version 0.7) and made sure that it
works OK on Linux 2.6.x.
It's available here:

changelog:
version 0.6 (never released/announced):
 * . add interactive keyboard inputs for l(ines), s(econds), t(icks),
 *   u(nsort), h(elp) or ?(help), q(uit)
version 0.7:
 * . make a difference in profile_lines and console_lines; they were
 *   the same, which caused some heading lines to scroll off the
 *   top of the console and make general garbage of the headings;
 * . reduce the fixed heading info by 2 lines (no version, no dash line);
