do_each_thread()/for_each_process():
------------------------------------
(1) reserved for special "catastrophic" operations
	e.g. OOM, killall, cap_set_all(), etc.
(2) use for_each_task_pid() or maintain lists/tables of tasks etc. instead
(3) kernel API is missing some pieces to make it avoidable for all callers
