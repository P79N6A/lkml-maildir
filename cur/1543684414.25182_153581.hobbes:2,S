Kconfig now supports config options at the top level, but changing the 
position of CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL at this point is probably a bad idea.

menuconfig is meant for generic options, like CONFIG_IDE or CONFIG_SCSI, 
so that you can easily see whether they are enabled or not.

This should be fixed.

Yes, it's supposed to help the user, how options are related. This needs 
some manual fixing. If you want to start somewhere, try to fix these 
first. It usually requires only moving an option around or adding another 
dependency. xconfig is extremly useful here, enable "show all options" and 
you can easily see which option breaks the indentation and the debug info 
tells you where to find this option.
Please don't do any major reorganization, this is not what we need right 
now.
