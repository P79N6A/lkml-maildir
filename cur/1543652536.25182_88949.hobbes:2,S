Btw, here's a little headsup for all maintainers of scsi host adapter
drivers.  In 2.5.47 the detect and release methods of the Scsi_Host_Template
have become optional.  If you had an old pci driver with the following
loop in foo_detcect:
	while ((pdev = pci_find_device())) {
		[do basic setup]
		sdev = scsi_register();
		[do more setup]
	}
You can convert it easily into a new-style pci driver with the following
probe routine:
	[do basic setup]
	sdev = scsi_register();
	[do more setup]
	return scsi_add_host();
Similarly a new routine, scsi_remove_host exist to call at the end
of the remove routine.
