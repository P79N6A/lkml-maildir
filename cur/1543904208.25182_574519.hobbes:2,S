Subject: [PATCH] powerpc: Pegasos keyboard detection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

As of 2.6.22 the kernel doesn't recognize the i8042 keyboard/mouse controller
on the PegasosPPC. This is because of a feature/bug in the OF device tree:
the "device_type" attribute is an empty string instead of "8042" as the
kernel expects. This patch (against 2.6.22.1) adds a secondary detection
which looks for a device whose *name* is "8042" if there is no device whose
*type* is "8042".
