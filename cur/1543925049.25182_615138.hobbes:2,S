The bug is that syslinux incorrectly positions the stack above the 
command line (but not the stack pointer register; hence the kernel patch 
exposing this bug.)  So the stack plus command line end up being limited 
  to 512 bytes; how much stack gets used depends on the BIOS, so one 
BIOS may use a lot more than another.
