No, I was proving merely that it is _different_.  And the values where 
you see a _difference_ are the ones of which are no longer sized 
optimally, after you grow the fs to a larger size.
So you incur a performance penalty for resizing to size S2, rather than 
mke2fs'ing the new blkdev at size S2.  Certainly within the confines of 
ext3 that cannot be helped, but a different inode allocation strategy 
could improve upon that.
