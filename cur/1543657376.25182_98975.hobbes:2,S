kexec() still has not quite made it into the kernel yet...
Can we at least finish one piece before starting on the next?

In this case you stagger the reboots, then if you have failover you

KABOOM... you just saturated the network with NFS traffic.

On MCR (960 nodes at the time) I have rebooted the entire cluster,
including downloading a the kernel over the network in a minute.   And
a complete reinstall of all compute notes in the cluster took about 5
minutes.  With a little care most of the extra management complexity
of a large cluster is due to hardware problems.
There are two very different  problems being considered here:  high
availability clustering, and high performance clustering.  In high
availability clustering you though hardware at the problem so that you
application continues to run.  For high performance computing you
throw even more hardware at the problem so your program runs fast.
At some point the high performance clustering needs the high
reliability techniques because with enough hardware the failure
rate becomes noticeable.  Mean time between failure becomes something
you experience and can easily measure instead. 
Once the hardware has been made as redundant and as reliable as
possible job check-pointing next becomes the only way to run longer
jobs on the system.  Given that one MPI job may span the entire
cluster this is a very interesting problem.  Long term at least that 
is something that needs to be completed.

And back to the heart of the kexec territory.  Here you simply drop
irqs until the system comes back up.  And then drivers should poll
their hardware to see what state it is in when they come back up.
Additionally it is part of the kexec design to place hardware is a
quiescent state while the kernels are being swapped. 
So there should be no special kernel state that needs to be saved
across kernels.  Just enough state to recreate the user space
abstractions.
Additionally we need a scalable filesystem for the clusters. Lustre
shows some promise.  But it is not done yet.  Things like GFS are
o.k. But I believe they rely on all of the disks being on a single
storage area network which is a bit of a scaleability and reliability
problem.
