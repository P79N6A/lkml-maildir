IMHO anticipatory scheduling and readahead address different problems. RA is
simpler and cheaper. Reading a few more KB comes almost for free and that
helps a lot sequential reads. AS is useful for random i/o (fs metadata,
executables, ...), but it wastes time if the timer expires, or if the new
request wants data which is far away the previous one. AS is useful for
sequential reads too, but only if the application reads large chunks of
data, otherwise RA is better. I we need both RA and AS to address the
largest variety of workloads.
Bye.
