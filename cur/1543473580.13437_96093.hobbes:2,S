Hi all,
Linux 2.0.33
df /
Filesystem         1024-blocks  Used Available Capacity Mounted on
/dev/hda2             598665  537953    29787     95%   /
The thing is that : 
	29787+537953 == 567740
So what happened to 598665-567740 == 30925 ?
Are those for the superblock and the inodes table ?
Thanks
Hicham
