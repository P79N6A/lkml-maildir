Hi Nick,
I ran some dbt-2 tests against 5 filesystems with 2.6.1-mm4 and 2.6.1. I
see a degradation from 0 to 7% in throughput.  In most cases there
appears to be a significant difference in the i/o wait and user time
(for PostgreSQL) between 2.6.1 and 2.6.1-mm4, where the i/o wait time is
going up.  Thought you might be interested in the results since there
was a tuning patch in 2.6.1-mm3. I have links to more detailed results
(readprofile) here:

but here's a summary:
		% throughput change from 2.6.1 to 2.6.1-mm4
ext2		-5.9%
ext3		-5.1%
jfs		-7.0%
reiserfs	-2.2%
xfs		-0.3%
