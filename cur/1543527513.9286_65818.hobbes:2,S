That is an application. its issuing DNS queries aimed at the DNS port
of every machine on the class C. 
My first guess is that the Lizard installer is trying to find the router
by spamming the entire class C at high speed.

It even sends to the broadcast for the network (totally out of order)

And the network address.

One second later the app spams the network again
If I got that trace from a customer I'd probably demand a written promise that
they would not be running this software on their ISP connected network again 
until fixed.
It could be glibc but I think its a broken app
