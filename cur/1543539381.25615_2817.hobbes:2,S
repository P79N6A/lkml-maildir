AFAIK, all the SMP architectures that we care about guarantee that
reads of small, correctly aligned objects are SMP safe.  The hardware
ensures that you get consistent bytes, you either see all of the
changes or none of them, you never see a partial update.  So if you
change a value from 0x01020304 to 0x05060708 then a concurrent reader
will either see 0x01020304 or 0x05060708, never 0x05060304.
How small an object has to be to get this guarantee varies from one
arch to another.  For example i386 only guarantees 4 byte integrity on
4 byte boundaries, s390 guarantees 8 byte integrity but only when
aligned on 8 byte boundary, not on 4 byte boundary.
