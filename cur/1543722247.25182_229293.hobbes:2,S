The intent of msi_remove_pci_irq_vectors() is to support hot-removed 
operation. This function is not for a device driver to call and
should not be exported. I acknowledged the problem of the MSI-X region 
being only released in msi_remove_pci_irq_vectors(). I'm in a progress 
of updating the existing MSI-X code.
Thanks,
