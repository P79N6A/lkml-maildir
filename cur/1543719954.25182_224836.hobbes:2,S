Arggg, sorry.  Typo there.  It should have of course read
"I think based on those patches we should be able to properly integrate
LUSTRE once 2.7 opens"

It's more about maintaince overhead.   Maintaining features without the
user direct at hand isn't going anywhere.  Especially when messing around
deeply in the VFS.  By your argumentation we should also throw in all the
mosix and openssi hooks because they could be possibly useful, no? ;-)

I was always arguing against the lack of an intree user mostly.  Lack of
something that could we could merge even in the future is even worse.
