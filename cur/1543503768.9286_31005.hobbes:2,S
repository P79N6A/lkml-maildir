No, your example was very simplistic. Consider:
foo_bar wert
bar_baz asdf
baz_bum spam
This may become:
foo_bar wert 1
bar_baz asdf 2
baz_bum spam 3
It may also become:
foo bar wert 
bar baz asdf
baz bum spam

Well, it happens often enough.

This means you can not tell where you are by counting, which means that
you must have row headers with well-defined spelling and syntax.
Well, you don't have that. See /proc/cpuinfo for a great example.
See /proc/*/stat for another.
This whole argument wouldn't even exist without the stupid idea of
having the kernel produce formatted output. The _kernel_ (!!!) screws
around with sprintf(), then system software has to hack at the output
with ad-hoc parsers. Gross!
