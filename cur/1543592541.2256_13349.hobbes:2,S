It does boot once I build without ACPI. (though vanilla 2.4.5 boots regardless
of that). It disabled DMA by default for some strange reason, so I get 2.5Mb/sec
instead of usual 35Mb/sec from my HDD.
BTW, 2.4.5-ac1 fails on unmounting reiserfs for me with this diagnostic:
journal_begin called without kernel lock held
kernel BUG at journal.c:423!
I've seen this was reported for 2.4.5, too.
Bye,
