No, it is broken.  Even a brief read of the comment above
this code would have revealed that:
		/*
		 * If there is undo-protected committed data against
		 * this buffer, then we can remove it now.  If it is a
		 * buffer needing such protection, the old frozen_data
		 * field now points to a committed version of the
		 * buffer, so rotate that field to the new committed
		 * data.
The old code you replaced was:

and this version  has the intended effect of replacing any existing
committed_data field with the current frozen_data field, keeping the
contents of committed_data valid.  Your new code

will discard the state of committed_data entirely, and will assign any
existing frozen_data to the new committed_data field even if
committed_data was previously NULL.  That is *definitely* not the
correct behaviour.  It won't actually corrupt anything but it will
leak memory, as you'll end up creating committed_data copies of every
metadata buffer in the system, instead of this being done only for
those block bitmap buffers which need it.
