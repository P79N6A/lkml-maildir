you have more faith in the authors knowledge of how his code actually behaves than I think is warranted  :)
Or faith in that he knows what "unlikely" means.
I should write docs about this; but unlikely() means:
1) It happens less than 0.01% of the cases.
2) The compiler couldn't have figured this out by itself
   (NULL pointer checks are compiler done already, same for some other conditions)
3) It's a hot codepath where shaving 0.5 cycles (less even on x86) matters
   (and the author is ok with taking a 500 cycles hit if he's wrong)
If you think unlikely() means something else, we should fix what it maps to towards gcc ;)
(to.. be empty ;)
