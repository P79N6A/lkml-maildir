Yeah, but most of our problems had less to do with the VFS interface
per se, and more to do with the dcache/page-cache.   In the long run,
the portability is something you may want though -- not only to
provide support under BSD or whatever, but also to insulate changes in
the VFS API from user file servers.

Agreed, this will be something we'll (v9fs) have to keep a close tab

I see your point, but increasingly common usage environments are
distributed systems and I think network synthetics will have their
niche.

Probably the same thing they would say if ext3 was a user-space
application that always needed to be mounted via FUSE ;)

I think that remains to be seen.  There is much to be gained from
blurring the differentiation as we move Linux towards a first-class
distributed system.  If unified interfaces can be made "good-enough"
performance wise, what justifies having multiple interfaces depending
on network versus local?  Specialization has its place, but
performance mongering at the cost of design is what killed systems
research.  In the end, specialization has its place, but I think it's
always worth striving towards unified interfaces when performance
doesn't suffer to a great degree.

FUSE certainly has its place, and has done a great job creating an
environment in which it is relatively easy to create new file systems
in user-space.  My main point in responding was to take the position
that the v9fs mechanisms are adequate to provide user-space file
systems and that while it was not the primary motivation behind the
v9fs project, we are actively pursuing improving the performance and
robustness of our mechanisms for providing user-space (as well as
kernel-space) file service and developing an SDK to ease the
implementation of 9P-based synthetic file servers.
