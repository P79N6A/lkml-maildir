I agree with you.  Your code looks like it could be a reasonable
heuristic, but the only way to really find that out is to test
the code on live systems under varying workloads.
Maybe we need to wake up fewer tasks more often, maybe we are
better off waking up more tasks but fewer times.  Either way,
at this time we simply do not know and can stick with your current 
code.
