This should definitely solve this problem - as it was said
a few times before lockdep stops registering locks after
a bug, so even the lock which caused the warning isn't
reported. Here lockdep found a bug in a workqueue function,
so after this no lock or unlock isn't counted nor reported.
I think Ingo can tell more.
