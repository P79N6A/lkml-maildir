I wrote my original post with nmap in mind.
I use nmap all the time, it is a excellent tool. At times I 
used nmap to scan those IP's who scan my IP and have 
unleashed at times a barrage of counter-scans to the point 
of bringing my connection pretty much down. Some of those 
scanners must have big pipes.

100s to 1000s of unsolicited packets mainly to windows 
specific service ports day and also several burst attacks a 
day. These days I just leave the firewall logging off in 
order to play less with nmap ;)

Sorry, do not concur. Unlike windows and such, linux is a 
_fast_ moving target. The best bet to crack it a _inside_  
job by a trusted perpetrator (for example the debian case 
or the corruption of the kernels bk derived cvs repo ), 
which still ring bells... Remote exploitation of the odd 
random vulnerability in the absence of detailed version 
info is as likely as winning a jackpot.

Oh well, If I have a legitimate requirement for the detailed 
versions someone is running, I can ask. 
Again, most violations are  made possible by:
a) access to hardware or admin/root passwords (what was  the 
kernel.org case tracked to?)
b)  access to version info and utilizing a exploit short 
term (the debian case)
IMHO, to have good security, 1) use open source and 2)  
sound implementation of common sense security procedures 
beginning with the basic doctrine who does not have to know 
won't know.  Yes, some things seem never to change :-(

kernel.org kernels and gentoo linux will do for me.
