Well, before these changes, the only guarantee msleep() could make,
just like the only guarantee schedule_timeout() could make, was that
it would not return early. The 1-jiffy sleep was always tough to deal
with, because of rounding and such. And it's simply exacerbated with
HZ=100. It's not technically 20 times longer in all cases, it's 2
jiffies longer, which depends on HZ, so varies from 2 msecs longer to
20 msecs longer.
Thanks,
