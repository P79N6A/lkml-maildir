Well, if we provide a sane example script, the rest is up to the distros or
the people with this hardware to decide.

Correctness does matter if an affined task violates that affinity.  If we
are going to provide explicit affinity, we need to honor it under all
conditions, or at least provide an option to honor it.

I agree about invasiveness.  Maybe a combo?  Send SIGPWR iff a task is
actually handling it, otherwise mark it TASK_UNRUNNABLE and let hotplug
handle it?  A new signal would be much more polite, but SIGPWR can be made
to work.  What if a process catches SIGPWR, but does not handle CPU removal?
Do we wait for it's signal handler to finish before re-evaluating it for
TASK_UNRUNNABLE?  Yuck.  If a CPU gets yanked with no warning, where do we
run the signal handler?  Violating affinity again.
