   Considering a) it's just a few keystrokes to add a CC: line, b) it's the
   driver authors who are the first to get the bug reports, then yes it
   seems like a very reasonable request.
This list actually is the first place the reports typically
go to.
I'm a responsible maintainer, when I add a problem, I always go back
and fix it or revert my changes.  I never disappear after making
these kinds of changes.
