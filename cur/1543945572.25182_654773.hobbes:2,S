Subject: [PATCH] kernel-doc: fix function-pointer-parameter parsing
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

From: Richard Kennedy <richard@rsk.demon.co.uk>
When running "make htmldocs" I'm seeing some non-fatal perl errors
caused by trying to parse the callback function definitions in
blk-core.c.
The errors are "Use of uninitialized value in concatenation (.)..."
in combination with:
Warning(linux-2.6.25-rc2/block/blk-core.c:1877): No description found for parameter ''
The function pointers are defined without a * i.e. 
int (drv_callback)(struct request *)
The compiler is happy with them, but kernel-doc isn't. 
This patch teaches create_parameterlist in kernel-doc to parse this type
of function pointer definition, but is it the right way to fix the
problem ? The problem only seems to occur in blk-core.c.
However with the patch applied, kernel-doc finds the correct parameter
description for the callback in blk_end_request_callback, which is
doesn't normally.
I thought it would be a bit odd to change to code to use the more normal
form of function pointers just to get the documentation to work, so I
fixed kernel-doc instead - even though this is teaching it to understand
code that might go away (The comment for blk_end_request_callback says
that it should not be used and will removed at some point).
