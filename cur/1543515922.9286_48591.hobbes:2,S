OK, at 8:43 this morning, my Linux server had to be rebooted for the first
time in 14 days, because of some very weird lockup problem that I could
not explain what the cause is.  I had been sleeping until 10:00, at which
point someone woke me up complaining that the server was not responding
over the network. So I checked up on the server.. Someone had been logged
into X since around 8:00, so I promptly did a "quit" on the window manager
(FVWM), but that only gave a blue screen instead of returning to gdm, so i
did a Ctrl-Alt-BS, which exited the X session, but gdm did not come up, it
just gave the default B&W X screen. So I did a Ctrl-Alt-BS again, and it
returned to the console, instead of restarting the display manager. Really
worried here, I tried to login at the console with a couple difference
usernames, none of which I could do because after I entered my password,
it would just sit there for minutes at a time. So, thinking of nothing
else I could possibly do, and after trying to login via telnet & ssh over
the network, I tried Ctrl-Alt-Del, which did not work either. It got up to
the first closing init process, "Stopping keymap", and just stayed
there.  So, after getting out my printout of the SysRq docs, I synced the
discs, remounted them R/O, rebooted, and everything was back to
normal. After checking the logs, the only thing I could determine was that
the system completely stopped responding to any requests at 8:43, with the
following messages in /var/log/messages:
Nov 12 08:43:36 box dhcpd: DHCPREQUEST for 192.168.1.10 from
00:50:04:58:9d:1f via eth0
Nov 12 08:43:36 box dhcpd: DHCPACK on 192.168.1.10 to 00:50:04:58:9d:1f
via eth0
Nov 12 08:43:52 box kernel: parport0: PC-style at 0x378 [SPP,ECP,ECPPS2]
Someone had just printed something via Samba, and it printed OK, but that
was the last time of entry in any of the syslogs, except Apache, which
someone hit at 8:46:47.
I am completely and utterly stumped, because the kernel did not crash, per
se, but all services basically just froze.
