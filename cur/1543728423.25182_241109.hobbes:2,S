Subject: [2.6.8-rc4] New nfsd-related kernel panic
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

The following patch of 09Aug is causing kernel panics:
$bk get -D fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c
237d236
<       int len;
237a237
 >       unsigned int len;
269d268
<       int len;
269a269
 >       unsigned int len;
I can cause a kernel panic by mounting the remote filesystem
read-only and merely copying a moderately large tarball from it.
(The linux-kernel source tarball, for example.)
The panic occurs every time, after only a second or two at most.
It's so easy to reproduce that I haven't copied down the backtrace,
but I will if no one else can reproduce the problem.
Anyone else seeing this?
