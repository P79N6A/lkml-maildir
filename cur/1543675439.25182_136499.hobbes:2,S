OSDL has a linux stabilization web page where several tests are run
automatically when a new kernel is built.  It currently runs Linus'
kernel as well as the -mm series.  We do run LTP, I/O tests, memory
tests, reaim, and database tests as part of an automated regression 
run. Some of you are familiar with the web page, but for those who are
not, it is located here: 
http://www.osdl.org/projects/linstab/
  
In addition, there are links to other sites, most notably IBM's LTC
test results.
We have just completed a physical move to a new office and we believe
we have all of our systems working again, so test results for the
latest kernels are a bit behind.  We hope to have completed runs for
all tests by the weekend.  Note, we are experiencing some test failures
but we suspect it is due to the move and not the kernels at the moment.
