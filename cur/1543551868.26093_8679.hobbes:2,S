A single irq handler won't be re-interrupted, correct. Not even if you do
__sti().
(in the edge triggered IO-APIC case, the irq source is not disabled to avoid
missing events but the highlevel irq logic makes sure that the irq _handler_
won't be run if it was just in-progress somewhere in the system, even
if in another CPU)
But the fact the irq handler is single threaded with respect to itself is
irrelevant with the keyboard_interrupt case because that irq handler will be
recalled by _two_ indipendent irq lines (irq 2 for the keyboard and irq 12 for
the PS/2 Mouse).
