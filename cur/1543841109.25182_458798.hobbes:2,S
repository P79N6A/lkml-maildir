Well, yes and no.
The ipw needs the firmware on insmod time (in contrast to bcm43xx
for example, which needs it on ifconfig up time).
So ipw needs to call request_firmware at insmod time. In case of
built-in, that is when the initcall happens. No userland is available
and request_firmware can not call the userspace helpers to upload
the firmware to sysfs.
Well, not really easy to find a sane solution for this. :)
