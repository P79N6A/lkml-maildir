Yes, what would be the correct way to do this? And if it the latter
option, should that be implemented in ohci1394 or in pci_set_power_state?
grep says that almost nobody checks the return code of
pci_set_power_state. But e.g. usb/core/hcd-pci.c does...
(Side note: The sole function that ohci1394's suspend and resume hooks
fulfill right now in mainline is to change power consumption of the
chip. The IEEE 1394 stack as a whole does not survive suspend + resume
yet. A still incomplete solution is in linux1394-2.6.git.)
