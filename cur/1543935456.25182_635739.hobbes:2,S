It's not a workaround. The ext3 maintainers argue that every file
system should be checked from time to time. Therefore it's the
default. You do not agree with them, so change the default and be
happy. Or use another fs which claims that no check is necessary.

Indeed, and I think it's a very good answer.

Use the time you are currently using for whining on mailing lists.

Then write a set of udev rules for your SCSI devices. It's easy.

If you're not willing to compile, you'll have to use what other
people provide. It's your choice, but at least there _is_ a choice.

I tend to disagree. It's not hard at all to configure a kernel if
you know the hardware. It's even easier if you already have a working
config for some kernel version. Just use "make oldconfig" to upgrade
from one version to the next as already suggested by others and me.

That is clearly a regression and I'm sure Jeff and other maintainers
of the driver would be interested in details on this matter.
