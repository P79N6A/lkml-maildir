What is really needed is an attribute to add to function parameters, that
tells gcc that the parameter, if a pointer, will be initialize via the
function.
For example:
#define __assigned  __attribute__((initialized))
then declare a function:
int my_init_variabl(__assigned struct mystruct *var);
So gcc can know that the passed in variable will be updated. It could
then check to see if the function actually does initialize the pointer,
if the declaration is visible to the function definition itself.
Any gcc developers watching :)
