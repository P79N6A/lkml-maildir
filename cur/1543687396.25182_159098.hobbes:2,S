No, this does not break anything.
Setting drive->head to 255 is completely ridiculous.
Setting drive->bios_head to 255 is rather pointless.
In 2.6 this junk has been removed already.
On the other hand, you are badly mistaken if you think that your changes
do anything useful. The value drive->bios_head must be regarded as
random, and is only vaguely related to what the BIOS thinks.
In 2.6 that vague relation has entirely disappeared.
