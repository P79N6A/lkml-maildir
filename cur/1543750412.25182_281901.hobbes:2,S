Hello,
    I am intercepting system calls in linux kernel
2.4.28 for my project work. 
    A process can be blocked while executing a syscall
in the light of some resources needed. Now, I want to
find out whether a process has been blocked while
executing a particular syscall or it has finished it
successfully? If it was blocked I want to perform some
operation on it. Can anyone help me regarding this?
Thanks,
selva
