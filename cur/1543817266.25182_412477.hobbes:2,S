I'll write a changelog for you:
***
The earlier patch to consolidate mmu and nommu page allocation
and refcounting by using compound pages for nommu allocations
had a bug: kmalloc slabs who's pages were initially allocated
by a non-__GFP_COMP allocator could be passed into mm/nommu.c
kmalloc allocations which really wanted __GFP_COMP underlying
pages.
Fix that by having nommu pass __GFP_COMP to all higher order
slab allocations
***
Sound OK? Can you do it next time? ;)
