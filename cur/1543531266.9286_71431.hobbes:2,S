If we are looking to do translations to enable different people
to configure the kernel in their own language, then all three of
those will need to be language-dependant. They would probably be
better placed in separate language-dependant files indexed by the
config variable.

Some of the existing types really need splitting up into multiple
types. Specifically, `hex` really needs to be split into `byte`,
`word`, etc.

Some options are only relevant (and therefore only asked) when
CONFIG_XXX is set to 'm', others only when it is set to 'y' and
yet others only when it is set to 'n'.
The others are all reasonable except for possible language
dependance.

That is a definite requirement, but should be possible from the
existing data PROVIDING all IMMEDIATE dependancies are already 
specified.

I'm not personally convinced this is the right way to go.

This is more of a Makefile issue than a configuration issue,
although tweaks to both would be needed to get this working.

The current Makefile and config.in systems require that any
subdirectories be explicitly named before they can be compiled,
and the above requirement doesn't fit in with that.
However, it shouldn't be difficult to tweak the current setup
to deal with this issue.
Best wishes from Riley.
