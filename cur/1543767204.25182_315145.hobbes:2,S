There are several problems with the current soft-timer subsystem in
this area. Basically, the actual tick rate is slightly more than once
per millisecond, which requires adding one jiffy to compensate.
Additionally, one can't be sure ``where'' one is within a tick, so
another jiffy has to be added, to make sure the timer does not go off
early. sys_nanosleep() does something similar.
I will be submitting an RFC based on John Stultz's timeofday rework
which tries to resolve these issues.
Thanks,
Nish
