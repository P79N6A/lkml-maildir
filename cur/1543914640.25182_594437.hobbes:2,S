Solutions for your requirements can be reachable via a kernelspace
solution:
- The hybrid tuner support, that where your requirement, when all those
discussions started, were already added to the subsystem. So now, an
hybrid tuner can be accessed by both DVB and V4L devices;
- Audio standard selection is already possible via S_STD (it is already
working for a few standards, like NTSC/M JP and NTSC/M KR). Maybe more
standards should be needed, but hey, we still have 34 bits available at
std mask.
The point is: there's no technical need for userspace. This will just
add userless complexity.
However, you insist with your selfish idea that every other solution,
except the one you're proposing are bogus. This is not the way Open
Source development works. You should listen to people.
Cheers,
Mauro
