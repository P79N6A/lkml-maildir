I have still the problem described above with 2.6.12-rc2-mm2 and
reverting the above patch solved it. And yes, now I get many of those
PCI: 0000:00:0b.0 has unsupported PM cap regs version (1)
PCI: 0000:00:0d.0 has unsupported PM cap regs version (1)
PCI: 0000:00:09.0 has unsupported PM cap regs version (1)
messages.
