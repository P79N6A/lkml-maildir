Subject: [GIT PATCH] hwmon updates against ~v2.6.23-rc1-git8
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi Linus:
Please pull from:
	git://lm-sensors.org/kernel/mhoffman/hwmon-2.6.git release
You'll get a handful of cleanups and bugfixes (including a couple that fix
regressions since 2.6.22).  The Macbook gets some additional sensors, and
there's also one brand new driver, which has spent some time in the latest -mm.
This patch series was also posted to the lm-sensors list yesterday:

Thanks & regards,
