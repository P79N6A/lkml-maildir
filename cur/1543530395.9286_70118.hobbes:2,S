No, not easily or quickly.  The 2.3 structure has been completely changed,
starting from an old driver version.  Re-implementing my updates would take
two or three weeks.

They should be considered together: the CardBus (and hot-swap-PCI) design
issues are tightly tied to the media selection issue.  The driver must be
prepared to reset and activate the transceiver after a resume from suspend
state.  This is different than a in-operation reset.  (The former should
retrigger autonegotiation, the latter should not.)

Here is a recent version
  
http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/kern-2.3/index.html
  
ftp://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/linux/drivers/kern-2.3/tulip.c
My internal version 0.92 has the following updates from v0.91x on that page:
  Various changes to the header files to track 2.3.* updates
  Change the interrupt mitigation setting on line 2733 to
    (Josip Loncaric at ICASE did extensive experimentation to develop a good
    interrupt mitigation setting)
       outl(0x8b240000, ioaddr + CSR11);
