These I have tested the kernel 2.6.12-rc3-mm3 with the following test
suites, with kdump enabled
Test Suite: 
NetPerf, FSracer(race condition in file system) with LVM partitions 
(over ext2,ext3,JFS,XFS), NetPipe, ltpRunall, Cerberus, KernBench
System Info:
Distro: SLES 9 SP1
Hardwares on which is test cases are run:
A) 1way, Pentium IV 2.8GHz, 2G RAM
   - Network Interface (e1000)
   - Disk I/O: SCSI storage controller: Adaptec Ultra320
B) SMP, 2way, Pentium III (Coppermine) 1 GHz, 1.3G RAM
   - Network Interface (e100)
   - Disk I/O: SCSI storage controller: Adaptec Ultra160
C) SMP, 2way, Xeon TM 2.8GHz, 1.5G RAM
   - Network Interface (Tigon3)
   - Disk I/O: SCSI storage controller: IBM Serve RAID
Software:
1. kernel - linux-2.6.12-rc3-mm3
2. kexec-tools-1.101 + kdump patches
Command line parameters
root = <> vga=0x31a selinux=0 splash=silent resume=<> elevator=cfq showpts
crashkernel=48M@16M console=tty0 console=ttyS0,38400n1
Test:
All test were run with the kdump enabled.
o On SMP 2 way 1.5G machine ran test suite FSracer over LVM partition and 
  the test ran without failures. Manually caused panic by triggering 
  through sysrq-trigger.Secondary kernel booted properly without any 
issues. 
  I was able to take the dump.
o On SMP 2 way 1.5G machine ran test suite netPerf as full duplex (both as 
  server and client) with SMP 2 way 1.3G machine serving as the other 
  end of the duplex. Manually caused panic through sysrq-trigger in SMP 
  2 way 1.5G machine and able to get dump successfully.
o SMP 2 way 1.3G machine ran Netperf, the test ran successfully. along 
  with full duplex NetPipe test that I mentioned earlier. Manually 
  caused panic in SMP 2 way 1.3G machine through insmod  and able to get 
  dump successfully.
o SMP 2 way 1.3G machine ran test ltp, test came out with failures (Bug 
  No: 4604,4612,4618). Manually Caused panic with insmod and second 
  kernel booted successfully and able to take dump.
o On 1way 2G RAM machine ran test cerberus, test ran successfully and 
  manually caused panic through sysrq-trigger and able to get dump 
  successfully.
o On 1way 2G RAM machine ran test KERNBENCH, test ran successfully and 
  manually caused panic through sysrq-trigger and able to get dump 
  successfully.
