Subject: [PATCH: NEW ARCHITECTURE FOR 2.5.5] support for NCR voyager
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

There are only three changes over the last voyager patch
- merge the minor processor capabilites change from smpboot.c
- correct the configuration mess with VISW and MCA to make the file more 
readable
- Change the completion to a semaphore in voyager daemon (completions always 
wait in D which was causing a spurious increase in the load average).
The patch (153k) is available here

P.S. Just to clarify, the Voyager series are microchannel (MCA) SMP machines 
produced by NCR with model numbers 345x, 35xx, 4100 or 51xx.
