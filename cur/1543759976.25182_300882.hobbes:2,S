In principle, you need to set your device handle (socket or fd)
to non-blocking before you use select() or poll(). It was never
resolved if the current behavior is a BUG. Nevertheless, it
is unlikely that it will be fixed because there is the belief
that it is NOT a BUG and even if it is a BUG, programs depend
upon this BUG to work.
