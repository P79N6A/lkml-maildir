Out of the box (SuSE 9.2) with kernel 2.6.11-rc2, powersaved
successfully suspends to RAM and resumes correctly (can't speak for
earlier versions). With 2.6.11-rc3, suspend to RAM works except that the
backlight on the display does not stay turned off. Once suspended, the
backlight is on even if the lid switch is closed!
Others with X31's (and I assume, other ThinkPads, and probably other
notebooks) have only gotten ACPI to work with earlier kernels by using
the radeontool to turn off the back light. See, for example, 
http://www.summet.com/x31/
 which includes the following:
Suspend to memory works well if you configure a few files like this:
    * Create an /etc/acpi/events/sleepbtn file as follows:
		event=button[ /]sleep
		action=/etc/acpi/actions/sleepbtn.sh
    * Create an /etc/acpi/actions/sleepbtn.sh file as follows:
 #!/bin/bash
 #Stop the bluetooth service.
 service bluetooth stop
 #sync the disks.
 sync && sync && sync
 #Change the screen to VT1 (text mode)
 /usr/bin/chvt 1
 #turn off the backlight on the laptop
 # (Note: You must have the radeontool installed....)
 /usr/sbin/radeontool light off
 #perform the actual "go-to-sleep" function.
 echo "mem" > /sys/power/state
 #Pause a second or two to let us sleep.
 sleep 2
 #Sleepytime...Everything after this line gets exectued
 #after the user resumes...
 #switch back to the Xterminal (automatically turns on backlight)
 /usr/bin/chvt 7
 #restart services...
 service bluetooth start
     
                       # # #
