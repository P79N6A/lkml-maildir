In doing so, you just added an extra option to the configuration...

As I understand it, the method you're supposed to use is to do the
following:
	cd /usr/src		; # or wherever...
	mv linux linux.old
	tar xzvf linux-$VSN.tar.gz
	cp linux.old/.config linux/.config
	cd linux
	make oldconfig
	make xconfig
With the exception that I replace the last line with "make menuconfig"
instead, that's what I've always used...
Best wishes from Riley.
