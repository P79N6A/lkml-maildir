My board is PCI-X for all 6 slots or I can use
PCI 64/66 for all slots. I am looking for cards that
are not slow on this. I have got a working system
with Promise PATA controllers that can read
in software RAID 250 MB/s in sustained read
and more than 150 MB/s random read. I am looking
for same speeds with SATA drives and controllers.
Thanx for the answer
