I need to build a stripped-down linux kernel that can be loaded into memory
for partitioning the disk according to various types of file systems (NTFS,
FFS, UFS, etc).  Not having much experience in doing so, I wonder if anyone
can point me to some helpful resources on how to so and/or successful
experiences in embedded systems and routers.
Thank you for your time.
Shirley
