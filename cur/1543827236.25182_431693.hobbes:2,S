after adding acpi-dock-driver-acpi_get_device_fix.patch the Oops is
truly gone, although the current behaviour seems dangerous to me. AFAIR
the undock button causes the disk to spin down and the backlight to be
turned off e.g. when the boot manager is displayed and power management
controlled entirely by the bios. What I got now was an endless loop that
caused everything including sysrq keys to be all but interactive, but
what bothers me more is the rythmic noise from the hard disk. It sounds
as if it was attempting a spin-down, barely audible, and only for a
fraction of a second. This happens about 1.5 times per second, and if
this is what I guess it is, it won't prolong the disk's life : /
Devices behind the PCI bridge are not yet discovered as well. Guess I'd
have to build a debug kernel some time soon. Dmesg dumps will have to
wait until "tomorrow", it's 4:45am and I feel like a dead piece of meat.
Thanks for your work!
Chris
