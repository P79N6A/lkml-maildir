I don't think you'll get anywhere with auditing.  We need to write down
the semantics you want, define them at the VFS level and make sure
they're not conflicting with defined userspace semantics or kernel
assumptions.
I think you need to learn the basic distinction between the VFS layer
and a lowlevel filesystem driver.
