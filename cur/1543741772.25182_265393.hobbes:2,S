Hmm... ksoftirqd/0 (or also ksoftirqd/1 on 2cpu SMP) are already
SCHED_OTHER by default, at least on both of my boxes that are running
RT-V0.4.1 now.
Should I try the other way around? Lets see... 'chrt -p -f 90 `pidof
ksoftirwd/0`',... yes, apparentely the xrun rate seems to decrease into
half, but IMHO not conclusive enough, thought.
