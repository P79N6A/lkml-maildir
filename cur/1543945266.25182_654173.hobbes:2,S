DM in theory has some more knowledge for optimization. e.g. for example if 
it knows that a stream of requests hits only a single device then
it can just pass the barriers through again and only flush when there
is really a request dependency between different devices.  File systems can't
do it that fine grained; it's either all or nothing.
I don't know if doing it fine grained will much difference in performance
though. The only way to find out would be to try it.
