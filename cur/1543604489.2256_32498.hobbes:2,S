Subject: Unconditional include of <linux/module.h> in aic7xxx driver

Can anyone comment on why the include of <linux/module.h> is now
unconditional in the aic7xxx driver?  Assuming MODULE_LICENSE is
properly qualified by an #ifdef MODULE, the driver appears to compile
and function correctly without this include.  Are MODULE attributes
(MODULE_VERSION/AUTHOR/DESCRIPTION/etc.) now supposed to be included in
static configurations?
Thanks,
Justin
