If you mean the code in arch_get_unmapped_area(), yes, this needs
fixing.  In fact, Ingo has already a patch which brings back the
performance of thread creation to what we had back in September/October.

Are you sure this is the best solution?  It means the mmap regions for
restricted 31/32 bit addresses and that for the normal, unrestricted
mapping is continuous.  This removes a lot of freedom in deciding where
the unrestricted mappings are best located and it would make programs
using threads have a very different memory layout.  Not that it should
make any difference; but I can here /them/ already scream that this
breaks applications.
My kernel-uninformed opinion would be to keep the settings separate.
Oh, and please rename MAP_32BIT to MAP_31BIT.  This will save nerves on
all sides.
