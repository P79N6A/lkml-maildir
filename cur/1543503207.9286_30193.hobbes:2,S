Hi,
I applied the kernel patches from 
http://ac2i.tzo.com/bridge_filter/
 
to 2.2.10 kernel source to enable IP filtering when bridging.
It works very well with ACCEPT and DENY. In an attempt to make it 
also work with REJECT (send back a dest unreachable ICMP message)
I added few lines to handle this case, no success yet.
The following is the excerpt from the patched net/core/dev.c:
#ifdef   CONFIG_FIREWALL
if(type==__constant_htons(ETH_P_IP))
{
    int fwres;
    u16 rport;
    /* call the bridge input filter function */
    fwres = call_bridgein_firewall(PF_INET, skb->dev,
				   skb->nh.iph, &rport, &skb);
    if (fwres < FW_ACCEPT && fwres != FW_REJECT) {
	return;
    }
    if (fwres == FW_REJECT) {
	skb=skb_clone(skb, GFP_ATOMIC);
	if(skb==NULL)		
	    return;
			
	offset=skb->data-skb->mac.raw;
	skb_push(skb,offset);	/* Put header back on for bridge */
	icmp_send(skb, ICMP_DEST_UNREACH, ICMP_PORT_UNREACH, 0);
	kfree_skb(skb);
	return;
    }
}
#endif /* CONFIG_FIREWALL */
icmp_send() returns quickly after checking packet type:
if (skb_in->pkt_type!=PACKET_HOST)
	return;
Fooling icmp_send() by setting pkt_type=PACKET_HOST before it gets 
called doesn't help match. It bombs out after ip_route_output() call.
As I don't have enough kernel know-how I can just trial and error 
and it doesn't seem to be an efficient method.
Would any of you experts like to comment? Is it possible to achieve
what I'm trying?
Thanks for your time.
Regards,
Chris
