Hello.
I am studying linux kernel 1.3.0.
In ip.c this sentence appeared.
if(iph->frag_off)
	{
		if (iph->frag_off & 0x0020)
			is_frag|=1;
		/*
		 *	Last fragment ?
		 */
		if (ntohs(iph->frag_off) & 0x1fff)
			is_frag|=2;
	}
what is that mean is_frag?
what's the difference between is_frag are 1,2,4?
Thank you.
