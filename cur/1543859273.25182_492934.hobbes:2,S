i admit this may not be entirely relevant, but it seems like a good place 
to bring up an old problem:  when a disk dies with lots of queued writes 
it can totally bring a system to its knees... even after the disk is 
removed.  i wrote up something about this a while ago:
http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/8/18/243
so there's another reason to "clear a dirty bit"... well, in fact -- drop 
the pages entirely.
