Hi Jörn,
Sorry for not commenting earlier, there were so many discussions on version
two that I wanted to wait for the fallout of that instead of duplicating
all the comments.
Here are a few things I notice while going through the third version:

It should at least be in the kernel-only errno range between 512 and 4095,
that way it can eventually be added to include/linux/errno.h.

This description had me confused for a while: why would you remove the
new inode. Maybe change the text to say 'target inode' or 'victim inode'?

Why is i_nlink limited? Don't you run out of space for inodes before
overflowing?

Could you bug the code to reserve fewer segments for GC than you really
need, in order to stress test GC?

logfs_alloc_inode() returns an initialized inode, so no need to call
logfs_init_inode() again, right?

Why not just store 64 bit nanoseconds? that would avoid the problem
with ns overflow and the year-2038 bug. OTOH, that would require
a 64 bit integer division when reading the data, so it gets you
a runtime overhead.

ext2 returns make_bad_inode(inode) in this case, which seems to be
a better solution than crashing.

Instead of the memcmp, you could do a new logfs_cmp_disk_inode function, so this code turns
into
{
	struct logfs_inode_to_disk dinode;
	BUG_ON(inode->i_ino == LOGFS_INO_MASTER);
	/* nothing to do if identical */
	if (!logfs_read_disk_inode(&dinode, inode) &&
            !logfs_cmp_disk_inode(&dinode, inode)
		return 0;
	/* write changed data */
	logfs_inode_to_disk(inode, &dinode);
	return logfs_write_disk_inode(&dinode, inode);
}
This at least gets the wasted stack size down to a single inode structure.

Almost all your static functions start with logfs_, why not this one?

Maybe split out the btree bits to a different header, that would make it
really self-contained.

And this should probably go to the header as well if you want it to end
up in include/linux/btree.h

I'd guess that the only interesting case is truncate to zero length.
If that is the same as truncate to embedded, it's probably good
to implement that.

mtdread is not a good name for a global function specific to one file system,
it should really be logfs_mtdread(). I'm also not sure if super.c is
the right file for the mtd access functions.

Is this safe if you have multiple file systems mounted on different
mtd devices, and both call the callback at the same time?

Again not a good name for a global symbol

How do you serialize access to these variables?

Now that the inodes are compressed, is there still a benefit of
having the uncompressed size be a power of two? I don't remember
the exact tradeoffs that we discussed for this, but IIRC the
biggest problem with making them larger is filling up the journal,
and there is no benefit in larger inodes unless you get to the
point where embedded files are a win (at 4KiB uncompressed inodes), 
while with really small inodes you don't have enough space
for direct block pointers.
Still, something tells me that it should either go down to
something like LOGFS_EMBEDDED_FIELDS == 16, or up to make sizeof
(logfs_disk_inode) == block_size, in which case embedded files
should be loaded into the page cache instead of the logfs_inode.

Because BUILD_BUG_ON only works inside of a function. You could
put them into a dummy inline function.
