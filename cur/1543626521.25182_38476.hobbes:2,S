Hi,
while compiling 2.5.7-dj3 I got the following compile error:
<--  snip  -->
...
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.5/linux-2.5.7/include -Wall

/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.5/linux-2.5.7/include/linux/hdreg.h:71: parse
error before `u8'
<--  snip  -->
The problem is that in 2.5.8-pre1 hdreg.h uses u8 but it doesn't include
types.h. I didn't tried it but since the code is the same I expect the
same problem in 2.5.8-pre1, too.
The fix is simple:
