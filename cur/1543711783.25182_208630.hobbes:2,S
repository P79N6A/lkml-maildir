We have moved the OpenIB web site to a new server and opened our mailing
list.  We invite everyone interested in InfiniBand support for Linux to
join us.  To sign up for the mailing list, send email with the subject
"subscribe" to openib-general@openib.org.  More information and list
archives can be found at <

DNS has just been updated, so it may take some time for changes to
propagate to your site.
