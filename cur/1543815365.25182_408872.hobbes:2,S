This is completely reasonable. And we don't need to refer to dprobes - that
was merely an evolutionary step.
I do have a notes that captured most the early design discussions and
decisions, which Prasanna and I should dive into to help answer some of the
points you raise.
Let me suggest, we chat among ourselves and pull together the relevant
details to answer each of your questions.
