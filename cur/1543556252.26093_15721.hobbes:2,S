Hi,
It looks like the random driver in 2.4test will return a
short read, rather than blocking.  This is breaking vpnd
(
http://sunsite.dk/vpnd/
) which breaks with "failed to
gather random data" or similar.
Here's a sample strace:
open("/dev/random", O_RDONLY)           = 3
read(3, "q\321Nu\204\251^\234i\254\350\370\363\"\305\366R\2708V"..., 72) = 29
close(3)                                = 0
Have the semantics of the device changed, or is vpnd doing
something wrong?
Matthew.
