I earlier questioned this too...
And I found out that read ahead was too short for modern disks.
This is a patch I did it does also enable the profiling, the only needed
line is the  
-#define MAX_READAHEAD  31
+#define MAX_READAHEAD  511
I have not tried to push it further up since this resulted in virtually
equal total throughput for read two files than for read one.
Is possible that the limit can be altered per disk, can it?
I have read about 127 being the current max limit...
