The code in 2.6.17 breaks when spufs is non-modular. Currently, this is
a compile-time option so users can work around it by building spufs
as a loadable module.
For 2.6.18, we want to make the part of spufs that calls this
non-modular in order to avoid adding further EXPORT_SYMBOLs. I would
much prefer to have the fix in 2.6.17 already, but we could
alternatively force spufs to be a loadable module in 2.6.17 and
change it later.
