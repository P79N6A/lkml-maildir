But lot of multicast applications use INADDR_ANY and most don't provide
an option to choose a specific interface. So I really think that the
kernel should bind the application to an ethernet interface and not to
the loopback interface to make them work.
Can you please check if it tries to bind to the loopback interface when
using INADDR_ANY by checking 'netstat -n -g' output?
