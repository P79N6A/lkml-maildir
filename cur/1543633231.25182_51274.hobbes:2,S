Sure. That obviously sucks; Linux can do better.
It's important to make a transition to Linux as
painless as possible. Nobody considering an OS
change likes the feeling that their data files
are trapped on one side or the other.
I remember the screams when umsdos support was
dropped from most distributions. It would be
great to have a modern substitute for umsdos.
FAT32, NTFS, and HFS+ are what people get with
their hardware.
