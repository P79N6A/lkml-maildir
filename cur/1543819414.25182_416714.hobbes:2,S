Stephen is right that the inode is the object.
Crispin is right that people care about path names.
The linux-audit folks have been hashing this
about good and hard. It is true that both the
pathname /etc/shadow and the inode it represents
are interesting from various secuirty viewpoints.
If you insist on either being the definitive
security referent you will be wrong about half
the time.
