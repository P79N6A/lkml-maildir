Greg,
Yes, these are valid warnings (as most warning are).  I am just flagging
these since they are NEW to the build.  These particular warnings are
likely to go away soon after Jan 1, which is good information to know. 
These warning will not show up again as NEW warnings.
BTW, Linus flagged these warning cases as part of changeset 1.1803.1.58.
