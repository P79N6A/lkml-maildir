Sure, I know that. But providing a package to tune a system setting
doesn't sound like a sane option either. This low-skill admin will
likely not know about this package either.
And between: 'install this package and magic happens', or 'If you have
problem A, fiddle know B so and so' I prefer the latter.
So my suggestion would be to provide good, simple and direct sys-ad 101
documentation for your specific distro.
Of course, your -server distro might have different default settings
from your desktop line.

Agreed, the kernel could perhaps handle it a little more graceful. Do
you happen to know what makes current Linux suck? Is it the excess of
tasks? (I've only ran a few thousand loops on CFS and that seemed to
work). Or is it the memory trashing that causes most problems?
My guess would be memory, and the problem is that the current overcommit
settings allow for a good experience for a lot of things, the downside
is this DoS scenario.
Our OOM killer often killing totally irrelevant processes doesn't help
either.
