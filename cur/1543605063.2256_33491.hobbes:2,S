Something isn't right in the reporting of used memory in the 2.4.12 kernel.
Don't know if it has been noticed yet or not. This is an SMP machine
if it has anything to do with it and I have BIGMEM enabled.
Here is a report of 'free'
                           total        used            free    
shared    buffers     cached
Mem:           1029700     752128     277572          0     309204     
477960
-/+ buffers/cache:         -35036    1064736
Swap:           2040244              0    2040244
Notice the negative used cache.
This also makes xosview act in some rather odd behaviour.
