Not yet decided. But both the words "cpu" and "power" will disappear :)
sched group can have one or more cpus.. so having 'cpu' is confusing
and 'power/energy' seems to be confusing too..
I don't like 'task_load' as it kind of refers to current task load in a
sched_group.  Currently I favor for 'load_capacity'. Anyone reading
sched code know what 'load' is.
If any one has a better suggestion, I am open.
thanks,
suresh
