While I agree that the kernel should provide decent error handling and 
reporting I still have to ask questions about what is reasonable.
What does that other OS do when you pull a USB stick out?  What do you 
think the kernel should do?  Why don't the applications operating on the 
data take better care of handling error conditions?
I don't have one here to try, but at some point the (ab)user needs to 
take a bit of the heat for his or her action(s) or lack thereof.
After all you could just reach in your case and rip out the IDE or SCSI 
cables.  Bet that leads to all kinds of stuff (tm).
Cheers,
  Dave
