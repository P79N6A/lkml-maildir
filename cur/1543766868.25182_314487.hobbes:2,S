Circular or otherwise hardlinked directories are not allowed since it
would not only confuse applications but the VFS as well.
Hmm, looking at the code it seems that for some reason I removed this
check from the 2.6 version of FUSE.  Stupid me!
Thanks for the reminder :)

A trivial DoS against any process entering the userspace filesystem is
just not to answer the filesystem request.
So it's not just information leak, but also a fine way to _control_
certain behavior of applications.
Thanks,
