There is a new version of the gcov-kernel patch on lse at: 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8875&release_id=74815
Changes in this release are: 
-resync with 2.5.66 
-detect gcc version for a section that needs to know that 
-profiling of modules is fixed 
The purpose of this patch is to allow utilization of the gcov tool
against a running kernel.  This is different from most other profiling
methods because it can easily tell you things like: which lines of code
are executed, how many times they are executed, and how often different
branches are taken. 
For anyone interested in this type of research, there is also a new
mailing list at:

Thanks, 
Paul Larson
