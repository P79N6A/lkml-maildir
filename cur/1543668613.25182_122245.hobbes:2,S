Debugging ode this obfuscated and crappy is as hopeless as trying to
debug the nvidia binary-only oops-o-rama.
What are the odds of just throwing away the isp1020 and replacing it
with anything else? It won't fix it, but it can't be fixed due to
utter lack of information about the things and/or lack of maintainers
with information hidden by NDA's anyway.
