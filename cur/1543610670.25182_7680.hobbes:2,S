Thanks.  I had hoped the version number was the only change, but wanted to be
sure.  I'll be keeping just one source tree for both 2.4.x and 2.5.x and
switching between the versions by applying and reversing patches as needed, so
it's important that my copy of the source stay *exactly* in sync with Linus'
copy (otherwise I've have just altered the version in the Makefile myself).
With the help of your patch I've just built both 2.4.16-pre1 and 2.5.1-pre1 from
the same 2.4.15 source, which is what I wanted.

hey, the _oficial_ word from Linus is that it had changed only the version:
[acme@brinquedo b]$ diff -uNr 2.4.15 2.5.0
diff -uNr 2.4.15/Makefile 2.5.0/Makefile
--- 2.4.15/Makefile     Thu Nov 22 17:22:58 2001
