I see the patch I made a few months ago for ESS playback speed fixing
(drivers/sound/sb_ess.c) was included into the mainline kernels now.  Well,
it seems to break things more than fix them, so I am asking that the patch
be pulled.
I don't fully understand what's wrong with it.  My 1869 needed the patch to
play correctly up until I booted win98 and came back...  now it needs the
old driver.  There must be something missing there which enables the higher
clock frequencies but until somebody finds out what it is, the old driver
will probably work better for everyone.
