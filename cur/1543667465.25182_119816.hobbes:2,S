hi all
    I'm being  modified loop block device driver for multi files binded 
to one loop device,
but the loop_thread sometimes seems locking the kernel.
static int loop_thread(void *data)
{
        struct loop_device *lo = data;
        struct buffer_head *bh;
        daemonize();
        exit_files(current);
        printk(KERN_INFO "i am here\n");
        sprintf(current->comm, "loop%i", lo->lo_number);
        spin_lock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
        sigfillset(&current->blocked);
        flush_signals(current);
        spin_unlock_irq(&current->sigmask_lock);
        current->policy = SCHED_OTHER;
        current->nice = -20;
.....
}
        It seems that  process name is still "mount" .It should be 
"loop0,loop1,etc.", isn't it?
        Anyone can help me?
