Slight misunderstanding: I just meant put the
static inline int get_ebda(void)
{
   unsigned int address = *(unsigned short *)phys_to_virt(0x40E);
   address <<= 4;
   return address;  /* 0 means none */
}
then do
addr = get_ebda();
if(addr)
     spm_scan_config(...)
Which actually fixes a bug too - the real PC can have no EBDA (EBDA
value of zero) and we shouldnt scan it if so
