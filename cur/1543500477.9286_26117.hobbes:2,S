2.3.7 isn't released.  It is for developers only.  Oh, it is
public available because anyone who wants to can be a kernel developer.
Availability does not imply usefulness.
If you are using a 2.3.x kernel then you sort of are a developer per
definition, 
even if your only contribution is to say "that feature doesn't
work/compile"
Commercial companies have just as unstable developer versions of their
systems.  They are usually not available though, because they are only
made available for sale.  2.3.x isn't a "selling" version, and 
the commercial distributors don't use 2.3.x kernels either.
Downloading a development kernel yourself is very much like obtaining a
nightly 
windows build from microsoft.  It is not for general consumption.

It is certainly too much to ask of the 2.3.x series.  Don't expect them
to
compile or work or not corrupt your disk.  They are experimental.

Sure.  If people are discouraged by things like the FAT problem then
they certainly shouldn't use a developer kernel.  They should *wait*
for the next stable release.  
If you want to run the latest reasonably stable developer kernel then
follow the
kernel list closely.  You may then find out which dev-kernels you can
run.
And which kernels you should avoid.  Never run the very latest unless
you 
can (and want to) deal with the occational troubles.  In that case, send
bug reports but no complaints.
My experience is that 2.3.6 works well (on x86), and all filesystems
compile.  
2.3.7 should be avoided.  2.3.8 works if you *don't* need FAT or >100M
files.
