Hi Andy,
Thanks for reply.
Funnily enough, I looked at this at work today and decided to check 
against 8139too.c from 2.6.2 and 2.6.3 trees.  There was a lot of 
changes, but it appeared only to that file (i.e. nothing referencing 
it) - so I have just built 2.6.3 with the 8139too.c source from 2.6.2 
just to make sure it isn't code elsewhere (i.e. pci stuff?) that is 
causing it.
So far it is running perfectly.  I will wait a while to test, and if 
it doesn't show any problems, we can presume it is the changes that 
caused this problem for me on my system.
Enquiries to the HantsLUG seem to be that no-one else gets this 
problem.
Nick
