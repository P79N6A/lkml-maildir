Andre:
If you just need one mainboard then I can mail it to you by UPS.
So, you need to tell me your mailing address.
By the way, we also develop Audio device and Ethernet (LAN) device.
So, we also need Linux Audio and LAN driver and application support.
Do you have channel which can support us the Linux Audio and LAN device?
Thank you!
Best Regards,
K.M. Liu

主旨: SiS IDE UDMA driver (announcement) (fwd)
One thing that I forgot to ask for, due to the wee hours of the morning
that I replied to you, was a mainboard or two that has chipsets that have
no/poor support in linux.  If there is a USA based part of the company,
I will send you my mailing address do that I can receive these item(s)
for testing.
Just the mainboard(s)....I have various proccessors, memory, ide-devices.
Attached is FREE PR, I gave you over the Linux Development Kernel List.
This is because you came to me with an open hand to work with Linux.
Regards,
Andre Hedrick

Anyone out there with this chipset.
I just got a give of datasheets from SIS direct.
They came to me for help.
This looks like a friendly vendor.
If you have a board with troubles, speak up.
I have enough on the plate for now, just cueing things up.
