When the post-install and pre-remove entries for module binfmt_misc are
hard coded into modprobe, there is no syntax in modules.conf to prevent
modprobe from always issuing those commands.  The next time somebody
decides that binfmt_misc needs different commands, everybody using the
old modutils on the new kernel will break.  I don't want the hassle,
put it in modules.conf where it can easily be changed.
If I can get an iron clad guarantee that binfmt_misc will never, ever
change again then I might consider hard coding the entries in modprobe.
BTW, I will need a signature in blood that says I can kill you if
binfmt_misc is ever changed :).
