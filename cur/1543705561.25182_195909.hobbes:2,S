Good I think the InfiniBand community would like to get some of the 
code into 2.6. 
The access layer is all loadable modules and does not require any kernel
changes. 
But we will need to look into integrating it into the build environment 
(and provide a patch for that). 
We will work with the InfiniBand HCA vendors, such as Mellanox and
Fujitsu, to 
get the 2.6 code tested on the hardware and put together a patch that
can be submitted for review by the larger linux community. If you would
like to see the code before we
run it on 2.6, we could possibly do that as well.

If it's a subsystem that does not touch any of the existing kernel (with
the exception of adding it to the build and Kconfig), then it probably
will not be a problem to add.
But then again, that all depends on what the code looks like, and none
of us have seen that yet :)
