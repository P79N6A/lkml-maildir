The files so far provided still do not seem to give these informations 
though...
Part of the project I'm working on -- click-click ui for handling 
modules, with some perks: in this case, getting info about loaded 
modules that I hoped to obtain via query_module.
Oh, and one more question: There were no particular issues with 
query_module, or were they? If there weren't, why wasn't it kept?
