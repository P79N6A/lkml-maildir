See my other message, and thanks for making this analogy :)
I -do- know the distrinction between hosts and devices.  I think there 
should be -some- way, I don't care how, to filter out those unknown 
commands (which may be perfectly valid for a small subset of special IBM 
drives).  The net stack lets me do filtering, I want to sell you on the 
idea of letting the ATA stack do the same thing.
You have convinced me that unconditional filtering is bad.  But I still 
think people should be provided the option to filter if they so desire.
