I have a dell machine, mother board has Adpatec 7890 and 7860 controllers.
I have my disks hanging off of 7890 and a cdrom off of 7860. I have no
problem compiling and booting 2.2.2-ac1. With 2.2.5-ac3 it recognizes
all my disks and cdrom fine. However, I am getting a kernel panic
when it comes to mounting root. I tried compiling AIC 7xxx both as module and
inside the kernel. No difference.
Any help is greatly appreciated
