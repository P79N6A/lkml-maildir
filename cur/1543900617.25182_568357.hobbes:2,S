Not really. A process has one or more threads, (virtual) memory, open
file descriptors, a uid, a gid and several other resources.
Historically there were only "processes". "Threads" were invented later
on so there is (usually) some confusion remaining  here .....

"switch process context" is misleading wording - "task switch" is better
(and "task" is usually the kernels view on a thread). You have at least
to store the registers of the old task somewhere and load the ones from
the new task.
