Although this would solve the problem, it may or may not be the right thing to
do.  The bug is not in pci_disable_device(), it's in the fact that we're
calling pci_disable_device() twice.  Whether pci_disable_device() should ignore
this or create an error is an implementation decision.  It might make sense to
have it print a warning. Greg, what are your thoughts?
What's important is that we don't want to suspend the device twice (in this
case suspend and reboot_notifier).
Thanks,
Adam
