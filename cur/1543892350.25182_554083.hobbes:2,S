I was reviewing some OLD mailing list archives then!

Per: 
http://www.edlug.ed.ac.uk/archive/Aug2003/msg00270.html
The kernel has a cyclic buffer of length LOG_BUF_LEN (4096, since 1.3.54:
8192, since 2.1.113: 16384; in
        recent kernels the size can be set at compile time) in which 
messages
given as argument  to  the  kernel
        function printk() are stored (regardless of their loglevel).
So it doesn't look like you can without recompiling...

Getting you the E820 memory map in a few moments.
Changed from 15 -> 16.
   | |    (16) Kernel log buffer size (16 => 64KB, 17 => 128KB)
