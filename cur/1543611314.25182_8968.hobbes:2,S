There is an easier way - depending on your point of view:
1. Designate a host on the network to be a loghost, and have syslog send the
   messages there. Syslog will use UDP to send the messages so if the
   network is dead, the messages will be dropped.
2. Don't log messages to a NFS mounted disk. Part of the problem
   in doing so causes a cascading of messages (NFS timeout, log
   the timeout, syslog writes to NFS... another NFS timeout + long
   delay with syslog trying to write the first... buffers fill up....
There should be an example entry in the default /etc/syslog.conf for
logging to a remote host, but the line entry should be:
*	@loghost
This can (most likely) be the only entry in the config file.
One advantage this has is that all log files can be scanned at
once, and on one system. Another is that if a workstation gets
hacked, at least they won't be able to remove any evidence that might
have shown up in the syslog output...
