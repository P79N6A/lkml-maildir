I certainly had a reversion plan and backups, but I don't have in-house
hardware duplicating every client configuration. But there's only so much
testing you can do before you put user load on the machine. Also, existing
machines doesn't mean irreplacable mission critical machines, I don't
upgrade unless I have a reason, and piss-poor VM performance certainly is
a reason.

I don't have that luxury. I can't afford to have a copy of most machines,
and after load and stability testing I have to try on production machines.
None of which addresses the issue that parameter name changes buy nothing
functional, and can cause serious problems. If the module in question was
needed for boot and in the initrd file the system wouldn't boot at all and
there would be little to tell why.
I'd like Linux to be more widely used, and things like this are not
invisible to the people who choose standards.
