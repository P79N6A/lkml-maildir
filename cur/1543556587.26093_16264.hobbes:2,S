Oh, btw, I forgot to ask people to give this a whirl. I assume it fixes
the APM problems for Kai.
It definitely won't fix the silly Olivetti M4 issue (we still touch bit #2
in 0x92). We'll need to fix that by testing A20 before bothering with the
0x92 stuff. Alan, that should get fixed in 2.2.x too - clearly those
Olivetti machines can be considered buggy, but even so..
Who else had trouble with the keyboard controller?
