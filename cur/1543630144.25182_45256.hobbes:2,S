Oh, I agree: I'd be perfectly happy for ksymoops to abandon trying
to disassemble the instructions after the oops, and I don't think
it need try to disassemble the instructions before the oops either.
It is important that it show the bytes (preferably before and)
after the oops, so that an investigator can locate that sequence
of bytes in a built object; and it is important that we have some
tool (objdump) which can disassemble the built object despite ud2
and its accompanying data; but ksymoops does not need to do it.
