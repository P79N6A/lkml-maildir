Huh? I don't follow you here. Why should this be easier for s390 vs.
x86? (And since there seems to be a trend to use HAL as a device
discovery tool recently: A new bus type is easy enough to add there.)
And I really think we should have a clean design in the kernel instead
of trying to wedge virtual devices into a known system. Exposing
virtual devices (which may be handled totally differently) as PCI
devices just seems hackish to me.
