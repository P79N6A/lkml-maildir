I have seen something similar on 2.4.19-pre8-aa3, but I haven't tried to
debug the setup.  I did a hardware reset (software reset would just reboot
after X started again) and was able to avoid the problem.  A few days later
I upgraded it to 2.4.19.  I haven't seen the problem since then, but it has
only been a few days.
