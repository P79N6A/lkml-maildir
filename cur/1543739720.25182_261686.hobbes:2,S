Heh. Clearly there's a gcc bug.. What compiler version?
I've got gcc-3.2 and gcc-3.3, and neither seems to have any trouble, but 
hey, I'm cursed by having fairly up-to-date systems.
That said, I know what's up, but it would be good to know what compilers 
have this problem..

Too much C syntax, too little CPP braindamage. 
I bet the thing is fixed by changing the
	#define __builtin_warning(x, ...) (1)
into
	#define __builtin_warning(x, y...) (1)
(ie add the name for the varargs macro argument). Never mind that we don't 
use it, and newer gcc's are happy - older gcc's clearly aren't ;)
