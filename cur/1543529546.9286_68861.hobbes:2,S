This is not how it all is done.

Difference is subtle but deep in fact. Default policy (vc/1 - first virtual
console, tts/1 - former ttyS1, ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part11 - former
hda11 and so on) is kernel's policy. Default userspace policy is to just
one-to-one mapping of kernel policy to /dev (or /devfs -- where devfs is
mounted). With devfsd you can change userspace policy and something other
then one-to-one mapping. It WILL NOT do anything to internel kernel's
policy. The ultimate goal is to REPLACE device numbers with names everywhere.
This can not be done for all devices till devfs is not mandatory, of course.
