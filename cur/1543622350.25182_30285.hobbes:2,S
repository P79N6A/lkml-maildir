  In the interests of historical accuracy.  It was a case of underlying
technology changes.  The original research was done with processors
with 8k caches (total) with the processors external and
internal bus speeds being the same and those equal to the backplane
bus speed.  Shift forward 4 years and you had 512 KB external caches,
and a ratio of the difference between the external processor cache
and main memory of over 20x.  This resulted in a very different 
set of optimizations resulting in the cache affinity schedulers.
