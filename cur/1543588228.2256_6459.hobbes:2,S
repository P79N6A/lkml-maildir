Hi,
WHen i upgrade from 2.2 to 2.4, my first version was 2.4.1,
in which i upgraded my quota utils to 3.00 and then converted to the new
quota formats for 2.4.
my last 2.4 upgrade was 2.4.2ac23, quotas work fine on that.
but when i run 2.4.3 they dont. quota -v on a user shows just blank space
next to the user name, edquota shows the quota numbers, but that's it,
changing them and redoing quota -v is the same.
everything puts the users over quota. doing a quotacheck shows the quota
files corrupted..yet boot back to 2.4.2ac23 and they work fine again.
did something change in 2.4.3? or does quota utils need to be upgraded
again? if so, where can i can them (i forget where i got them last time)
Thanx,
-Tony
