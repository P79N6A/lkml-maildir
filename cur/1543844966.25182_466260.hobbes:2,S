Oh, sorry for my unclear description, any of the peripherals can be configured
to wake up the core from its idled state to process the interrupt on
Blackfin. I should say __if no other interrupts__ here is the timer
interrupt waking up the processor every one jiffy.
I don't understand if interrupt occurs between need_resched() and the
idle instruction, what will become the racy object? Can you comment it
detailed? thanks.
