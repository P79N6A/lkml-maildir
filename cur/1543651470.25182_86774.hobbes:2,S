No, I was talking more specifically about de2104x driver.
For general drivers I prefer __devinit out of general laziness:  if 
there is not an active and kernel-clueful maintainer, then it's better 
to mark everything __devinit [with the wastage it implies].  But for a 
few drivers with obviously provable/disprovable cases, __init may be better.
So it IMO matters WRT maintainer and testability issues as well as 
strictly kernel/technical issues.
