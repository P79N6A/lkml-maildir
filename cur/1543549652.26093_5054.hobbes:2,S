Ehh.  One of the differences in the test9-pre kernels is a "trivial
bugfix" that actually makes one of the "schedule_timeout()" calls in
drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c actually _do_ something. 
Go into "drivers/sound/ac97_codec.c" to around line 570 or so, and
comment out the line that says
	current->state = TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE;
and see if that fixes the problem. 
Now, removing the above line will basically make the schdule_timeout()
be a no-op, so on the face of it the code has always before been
completely nonsensical.  But maybe the nonsensical code works, and the
logical code is broken. 
As far as I can tell, no other changes have happened in the sound
drivers, which is why I'd ask people to do this apparently idiotic
reversal of that single line..
