Subject: [RFC] PPC syscalls for XFS
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

To whom it may concern, I'd like to get some PPC syscalls reserved for
XFS xattr support, with syscalls #226-#237 to the xattr support; this is
the same position and range that is used for these syscalls on i386.
