We get the following compile error if CONFIG_BLOCK isn't enabled:
  CC      arch/powerpc/kernel/setup_32.o
In file included from arch/powerpc/kernel/setup_32.c:14:
include/linux/ide.h:558: error: expected specifier-qualifier-list before 'request_queue_t'
include/linux/ide.h:696: warning: 'struct request' declared inside parameter list
include/linux/ide.h:696: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want
include/linux/ide.h:820: warning: 'struct request' declared inside parameter list

make: *** [arch/powerpc/kernel] Error 2
What I'm trying to figure out is if include/linux/ide.h should be wrapped
in a #if defined(CONFIG_IDE) || defined(CONFIG_IDE_MODULE) or if there is
some other desired way to handle this.
This seems to stem from the fact that include/linux/blkdev.h is wrapped in
a CONFIG_BLOCK and thus request_queue_t isn't always defined.
