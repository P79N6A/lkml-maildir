I just went through every variant of arm in the kernel tree, and I found that
*all* of them implement a simple linear relationship between kernel virtual and
physical memory, of the form:
   #define __virt_to_phys(vpage) ((vpage) - PAGE_OFFSET + PHYS_OFFSET)
   #define __phys_to_virt(ppage) ((ppage) + PAGE_OFFSET - PHYS_OFFSET)
With such a linear mapping you *cannot* map physical memory distributed across
more than one gig into one gig of kernel virtual memory.
Are you talking about code that isn't in the tree?
