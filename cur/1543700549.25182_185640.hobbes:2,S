I'm not a crypto-loop user, so I am not in a position to judge whether
using dm for crypto-on-disk is feature-sufficient and adequate from an
operational point of view.
It is good that Joe-and-co are OK with it and are prepared to help support
it.  If the people who _do_ use crypto-loop like the look of the feature
set and the user interface then fine.  Certainly the loop driver has a long
history of not working very well.
So.  If those-in-the-know like it then go wild.  It would be useful to get
an opinion from the distro guys too.
However I suspect that there will be a migration issue, and that we should
continue to work to get crypto-loop functioning well, plan to remove it
from 2.8, yes?
