Yes I use APCI support.
Ah, I have been trying to use 'noacpi' so I guess I have failed to
turn it off.  I'll give 'acpi=off' a try.
The keyboard is as dead as the rest of the system.
I am running the nVidia binary module.  
I'll run 'acpi=off' for a week or two and then try the nv driver.
Thanks for the help,
