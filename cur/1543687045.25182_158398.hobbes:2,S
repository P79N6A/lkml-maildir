In sys.c:set_user() we see
        if (atomic_read(&new_user->processes) >=
                                current->rlim[RLIMIT_NPROC].rlim_cur &&
                        new_user != &root_user) {
                free_uid(new_user);
                return -EAGAIN;
        }
which was added in patch-2.6.0-test2.
No doubt this causes your problem.
You might check what values these variables have for you.
