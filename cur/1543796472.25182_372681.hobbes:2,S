But this change destroys LRU ordering: at the time when shrink_list()
inspects PG_activate bit, information about order in which
mark_page_accessed() was called against pages is lost. E.g., suppose
inactive list initially contained pages
     /* head */ (P1, P2, P3) /* tail */
all of them referenced. Then mark_page_accessed(), is called against P1,
P2, and P3 (in that order). With the old code active list would end up 
     /* head */ (P3, P2, P1) /* tail */
which corresponds to LRU. With delayed page activation, pages are moved
to head of the active list in the order they are analyzed by
shrink_list(), which gives
     /* head */ (P1, P2, P3) /* tail */
on the active list, that is _inverse_ LRU order.
