can you tell me the name and the location of the mlock sysctl? For now
I'm going to allow remap_file_pages only if the mlock sysctl is enabled,
and at the same time I can allow all other mlocks too.
I was thinking at soemthing like "enable-local-mlock" but since you
already implemented it, it's worth to use the same one.
thanks.
