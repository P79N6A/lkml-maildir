Stephane's perfmon2 patch adds yet another special-case to the
switch_to() code, so Andi suggested this change.  It will allow
the perfmon2 patch to have no performance impact on normal
task-switching, since it will just use another flag.
After I saw a ~7% gain in task-switch performance, I like it now
even without perfmon2 in there.

Well yeah, there is that.  But Andi and I both reviewed it and he's
already put the x86_64 version into his tree.  Testing in -mm should
show whether there are any problems.
