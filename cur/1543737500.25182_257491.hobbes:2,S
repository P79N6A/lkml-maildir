What's clear is that 'exclusive' is not a sufficient precondition for
whatever it is that CKRM needs to have sufficient control.
Instead of trying to wrestle 'exclusive' into doing what you want, do me
a favor, if you would.  Help me figure out what conditions CKRM _does_
need to operate within a cpuset, and we'll invent a new property that
satisfies those conditions.
See my earlier posts in the last hour for my efforts to figure out what
these conditions might be.  I conjecture that it's something along the
lines of:
    Assuring each CKRM instance that it has control of some
    subset of a system that's separate and non-overlapping,
    with all Memory, CPU, Tasks, and Allowed masks of said
    Tasks either wholly owned by that CKRM instance, or
    entirely outside.
