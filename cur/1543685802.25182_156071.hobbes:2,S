same here on x86, gcc-2.95.3 and gcc-3.3.1. The compiler is smart enough not
to add several intermediate tests for !!(x).

I agree (I didn't think about pointers, BTW). But what I meant is that we
don't need the result to be precisely 1, but we need it to be something the
compiler interpretes as different from zero, to match the condition. So it
should be cleaner to always check against 0 which is also OK for pointers,
whatever their type (according to Chip's link) :
  likely => __builtin_expect(!(x), 0)
unlikely => __builtin_expect((x), 0)
Cheers,
Willy
