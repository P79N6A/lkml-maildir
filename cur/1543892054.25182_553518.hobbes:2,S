Yes.

I like freezer better :-).

No, -EAGAIN is not nice.

Blocking would be possible option. I agree it is tricky to
implement... it may also be useful for a harddrive:
"I'm riding a horse at 40kph now, so you'll kill the harddrive if you
access it; just freeze everyone until we are at the other end of
meadow".
...hmm, but this seems to be blockdevice specific, and I can't think
of a network or char driver where similar behaviour would be useful.

Agreed.
