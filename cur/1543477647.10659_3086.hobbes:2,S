I know that most of you do not like aging.  Nevertheless, on high stressed
systems with less than 128M you will see a critical point whereas the page
cache and readahead does not avoid that swapin I/O time needed by a program
increases to similar size of the average program time slice.
At this point the system performance breaks down dramatically even
with 2.2.0pre[567] ...
What's about a simple aging of program page cluster or better of the
page cache?  Increasing the age could be done if and only if the pages
or page clusters swapped in and the program wasn't able to use its
time slice. Decreasing the age could be placed in shrink_mmap().
