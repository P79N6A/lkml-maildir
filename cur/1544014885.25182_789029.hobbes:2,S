Yes, do_wait(WNOWAIT) will return the same result on each call. Until
the next child dies, and this child is closer to the head of ->children
list.
But the reason is not that waitfd just calls waitid() internally. Let's
suppose we add another helper (or waitfd_read() can do this by hand) so
that read(waitfd_with_WNOWAIT_flag) correctly returns the info about all
childs. Now, what should the next read() do?
Btw. It is not that I am trying to argue against sys_waitfd(), but do
you have the "real life" example when it can be useful? Yes, poll().
But we have signalfd. SIGCHLD is not rt signal, but afaics this is not
the problem actually. Just curious.
Oleg.
