Then why MS has that auto-update service of theirs?

Because hardware verdors act stupid and many of them still do
not write open-source drivers (or at least provide adequate docs).

IOW: "we want to hijack millions of lines of Linux source and won't
contribute back our driver(s). Why do you kernel guys make that hard?"
Because we don't like what you're doing.

The source is ultimate doc. You never ever will get such a complete doc
for any commercial OS. It even documents all bugs! ;)

Wrong. You should do: "Let's submit it for inclusion in mainline".
If you don't want to, it's your problem, not ours.

You may backport your driver to older kernel(s). Sometimes distro(s)
will backport your driver to older kernels if there is demand.

Maintain them "in-tree", not in your own corner.

Yeah, yeah. I just wrestled with 2 so called "GDI" printers for Windows
from 2 different vendors. Both vendors _refused to fix obvious bugs_
in their Windows drivers. Do you want THIS type of driver maintenance
to occur in Linux world too?
