This is where it gets intersting in a hurry, the same machine will
appear as 500, 600, 650, 700 or 750MHz both with AC and without AC on
successive reboots. There seem actually to be little logic in it. I've
now rebooted since I originally posted the first mail, and I'm now
identified as 600MHz, as opposed to 650MHz about an hour ago.
Anyway, being used to a 486dx-40 I don't see the above as a huge
problem... :]
cheers,
Alexander
