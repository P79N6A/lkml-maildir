Hi,
below is a patch that redefines align:
- align not zero: use the specified alignment. I think values smaller than
sizeof(void*) will work, even on archs with strict alignment requirement
(or at least: slab shouldn't crash. Obviously the user must handle the
alignment properly).
- align zero:
* debug on: align to sizeof(void*)
* debug off, SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN clear: align to sizeof(void*)
* debug off, SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN set: align to the smaller of
   - cache_line_size()
   - the object size, rounded up to the next power of two.
  Slab never honored cache align for tiny objects: otherwise the 32-byte
  kmalloc objects would use 128 byte objects.
The patch is against 2.6.6-rc2. What do you think?
There is one additional point: right now slab uses ints for the bufctls.
Using short would save two bytes for each object. Initially I had used
short, but davem objected. IIRC because some archs do not handle short
effeciently. Should I allow arch overrides for the bufctls? On i386,
saving two bytes might allow a few additional anon_vma objects in each
page.
