First things first: Pls CC me, I'm not subscribed.
There is a line in fs/partitions/msdos.c that lets extended partitions 
be max 1k (..."==1 ? 1 : 2"...). The comment explains it to protect 
sysadmins from themselves. But /dev/hda isn't similarly protected. That
is because it would prohibit other uses. But now I have found a 
legitimate use for extended partitions in their full length. Emulation.
Please remove this, or make it a config option.
Next problem: make O=... ...-pkg doesn't work. Reason: In
scripts/packages/Makefile
all -pkg target call $(MAKE) but from $(obj). This line(s) must be
augmented
with "-f $(srcdir)/Makefile". I don't know if $(srcdir) must be
conditional on O.
