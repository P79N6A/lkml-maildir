Hey there,
I finally managed to get cpufreq working. And while using the
userspace governor, I came up with a curious output.
[root@localhost cpufreq]# cat *

This is on a Core 2 Duo E6300 processor. The dmesg looks like this,
cpufreq-core: setting new policy for CPU 0: 1596000 - 1862000 kHz

How can I verify what is the processor speed I'm running at? And is
this the result expected? (Also is this how I change the frequency in
a multi-core system? Googling did not really get me anything) As a
side note, I'm also curious to know whether multi core systems support
the processors running at multiple clock speeds? (Somewhere I remember
understanding the code to add all the processors to be added to
affected_cpus map, and if any cpu in that one is affected, all of them
are. Did i understand it right?)
Thanks and regards
