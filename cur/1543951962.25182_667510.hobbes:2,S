Probably because the CONFIG_KEYS=n version of key_serial() has to be a macro
(so as to discard key without any attempt at evaluation).
However, that doesn't apply to the CONFIG_KEYS=y case, so I'll whip up a patch
to alter that for you.

Downside #2: the #ifdef is documentation of a sort.  Personally, I prefer the
extra #ifdef here as it makes it clearer to someone looking at the .h file why
their code doesn't compile/link rather than them having to know to go fishing
in Makefiles.

As I understand it, the same applies to any UID.  UID 0/root is typically
special, but I don't know how this is normally handled in alternate containers
for other kernel objects.  I can't just go and look at a capability on current
because the quota belongs to the user, not the process.
I have become aware in the last couple of days that the container people
missed or left out keys.  Possibly key IDs as well as key quotas should be
separated.
