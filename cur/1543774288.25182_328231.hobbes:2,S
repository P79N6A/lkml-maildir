Review by uniprocessor benchmark perhaps. However Reiser4 is new code.
The original extfs on Linux was not very good either while ext2 was
excellent. It seems inappropriate to technically review one fs based on
the other. Looking at the authors maintenance record I think is
important but every single star Linux kernel contributors first major
contribution was generally not very good.
