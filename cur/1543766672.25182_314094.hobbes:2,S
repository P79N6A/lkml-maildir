Problem 1:
 - you're mounting things into the global namespace, but expect it only
   be visible to a certain subset of processes.  these processes are also
   not specicified by a tradition unix session / process group / etc but
   against all the process attributes we have based on the uid
Problem 2, which is related:
 - in fuse you're re-routing filesystem request to userspace, so fine so good
 - mount is currently a privilegued operation, and expects a privilegued
   filesystem implementation, not an ordinary user
 - to bypass that you have a suid mount wrapper
 - now you need various hacks to make sure this can't be used by other users
in short you are hacking around the namespace management which sits above
the filesystems in a rather broken way.
