What/who do you break, when they are not selecting CONFIG_X86_PAT? The
help text can be suitably alarming. I feel this is no argument at all.

A blacklist would seem to be really much preferred. All of AMD family 6
has been excluded in one fell swoop now for example, while I sort of
expect not any of them should be.

The trouble is -- if you hide that the CPU _should_ have PAT, how many
people do you expect are going to look further and test? I knew that I
should have PAT so I distrusted my CPU feature flag display but you've
now limited your testers to people who've read the CPU datasheet.
That's really no good.
If Linux messes around with those flags already, it's doing things
wrong already. /proc/cpuinfo is not a display of software features
but of hardware features -- anything else is outright wrong. Being
wrong for PAT also doesn't improve things.
Rene.
