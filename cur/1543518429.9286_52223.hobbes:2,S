Absolutely.  I am 100% committed to this.  Apart from anything else,
this is the mechanism which will allow for incompatible revisions of
the ext3 journal format: you will always be able to mount a journaled
ext3 partition as ext2, and then remount as the new ext3, if you want
to upgrade ext3 partitions to a new, incompatible format (which should
not happen after final release, but there will be at least one such
incompatible format revision required in the next month or so).
Any such format changes will be limited to the journal format: there
will be no journaling changes which prevent backing the filesystem
revision back down to ext2.  Ever.
