Looks like when you are writing to your raw
partition you are overwriting the partition
with the file system on. To be absolutely sure
you can try the following steps:
1- overwrite your file system partition 
with known data (ie. nulls).
2- Run your raw test on the other partition
3- See if the first partition data is 
changed. If it is the there is a bug in
your test program.
