Dear Linux developers,
I carried this thread on in April 2008 because my computer was crashing every other day. I tried and tried and thought I had reached a solution many a time, but eventually they all proved illusive. Eventually the box kept crashing every other day, applications often dumped core and the only SysRq combination to work was the B one.
But then my motherboard burned out. So I went and bought another one. And magically all my problems disappeared. Interestingly enough, the temperature seems to have gone down at least 15°C.
I'm not sure if this can still be a kernel issue, but it definitely seems not to me. I had installed FreeBSD on the system back then and it would crash also. Anyway, my faith in Linux has risen up once again. This system seems rock solid now, it's been a while.
I'd like to say thanks to all, and I'm glad to have such a great stable system once again. Thank you for developing this incredible system, it is definitely a superior system for me, and "superior" in this case is a self-sufficient term.
Best regards,

Correct. 
But I'm not sure it's an exclusive i/o thing. I've had the box
crash in
situations where I don't think heavy i/o is involved.. for instance, it
crashed two times just as I closed the iceape browser.

I'm actually running 2.6.25-rc7-git6 now.
(so I really don't think that would make much of a difference)

Absolutely nothing. Never.

Hmm, I have no serial consoles here, and my spare box is dead. 
Unless I can attach netconsole to a windows box.
I can probably crash it in console mode, without Xorg. Then I hope something
might show up in another vt at least.

There is definitely a random element in it. But I can reliably crash it.
Just trigger some CPU and i/o bound processes. I've crashed it with
operations
which would only read from the disk, for instance unpacking to /dev/null.
Sometimes it takes longer, though.
> could you try if just reading from the raw blockdevice makes a differnce ?
(dd

Yes, I can try that. But please bear with me as I won't be working full
time
in this. I hope we can get to the bottom of this, but it might not be as quick
as we'd like.
Thank you very much for the help.
I'll write back asap.
Best regards,
