Actually some SCSI controllers (especially intelligent ones like Mylex
or GDT) seem to spin a potentially long time queueing packets with
interrupts off to the SCSI adapter. See all the "TLB IPI timeout" problems
reiserfs has with heavy IO load (reiserfs seems to do more aggressive
IO than ext2, resulting in longer queues, resulting in more latency needed
for queue handling)
