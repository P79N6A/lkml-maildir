c) Observe that all the files touched are identical in the two repositories
	before the changeset in question.
   Copy the post-changeset SCCS files for the changed files to the new 
	repository.
   Get the relevant lines identifying each new delta from the ChangeSet file
	in the original repository, add them to the ChangeSet file in the
	new repository, and bk ci it.
   Mutter darkly that this really shouldn't be hard to get BK to do by
	itself, in the case where the pre-changeset files are identical in
	each repository.
Admittedly I hadn't created any files that time, just committed a large
patch by copying in the new version of many files (from a CVS tree), running
bk citool and giving an appropriate change log for each one - hence I didn't
want to lose the change logs by exporting and reimporting it when I
realised I'd actually done it in the wrong repository.
