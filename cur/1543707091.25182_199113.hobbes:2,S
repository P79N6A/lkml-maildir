Yes. I looked at that a year ago, and it should be pretty easy to make the 
backspace code look more like the "delete word" code - except the "word" 
is just a utf character.
(Btw, that's one of the things I like about UTF-8, and shows how _well_ 
designed it is - it's trivial to find the beginning of a UTF-8 character, 
even when just doing a stupid scan backwards).
I didn't care enough to really bother fixing it - the fact is, that people 
who care about UTF-8 tend to have to be in graphics mode anyway, and there 
is something to be said for keeping the text console simple even if it 
means it lacks functionality.
But if somebody cares more than I do (hint, hint ;), I do think it should 
be fixed.

Yes. And I'd happily take patches for it.
