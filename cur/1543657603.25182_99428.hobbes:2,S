More:  not just "from interrupt routines", also "when a spinlock is held".
Though one expects that if a dma_pool were in use, it'd probably have one
of that kind of chunk already available (ideally, even initialized).
Many task-initiated allocations would use GFP_KERNEL; not just major driver
activation points like open().
