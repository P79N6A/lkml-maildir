I currently intend to use this controller for controlling memory related
rlimits, like address space and mlock'ed memory. How about we use something like
"memrlimit"?

Good suggestion, but it will be hard if not impossible to account the data
correctly as it changes, if we do the accounting/summation at bind time. We'll
need a really big lock to do it, something I want to avoid. Did you have
something else in mind?
