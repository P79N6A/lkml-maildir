So if pci_enable_device() fails, what do we do with the still suspended
serial port?  Does it clean up that state?  Probably not.
Look, merely going around bunging this stupid "oh lets propagate the
error" crap into the kernel doesn't actually fix _anything_.  In fact
it potentially _hides_ the warnings produced by __must_check which
give a hint that _something_ needs to be done to _properly_ fix the
problem.
And by "properly", I mean not just merely propagating the error.
In this particular case, the above may result in resources not being
freed.
