interesting.  Though I wonder about giving admins _more_ knobs to twiddle.
It took cpufreq a long time to settle down in this area, and typically
'ondemand' was the answer in the end for 99.9% of people.   I question the usefulness
for the whole multiple governors interface, because in the case of cpuidle
there shouldn't be any real trade-off between one algorithm and another afaics?
So why can't we just have one, that just 'does the right thing' ?
The only differentiator that I can think of would be latency, but that seems
to be a) covered in a different tunable, and b) probably wouldn't affect
most people enough where it matters.
I'll do a proper code review later, but one thing stuck out like a sore
thumb on a quick skim..

That's a horribly generic name for an exported global.
current_cpuidle_driver maybe?
