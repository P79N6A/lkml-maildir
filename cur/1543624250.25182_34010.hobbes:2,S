Apologies to all who don't care about VMS and file version numbers..
OK, no more vague memories.  I got my old VAX 4000 powered up, and three
amazing things happened:
1) The VAX booted even though it had been gathering dust for 10 years.
2) I remembered the SYSTEM password, and my password too!
3) VMS 5.5-2 was Y2K ready in 1992, taking today's date with no problem.
I fiddled around a bit with VMS, and it looks like the following command set things
up for me so that I only have one version for any new files I create:
SET DIRECTORY/VERSION_LIMIT=1 SYS$SYSDEVICE:[USERS.STEVEN]
This change was persistant across logins.  Hope this helps.
