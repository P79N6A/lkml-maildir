Some of the atomic headers use constructs such as disabling interrupts
which are not permitted in user space and if they were, would _silently_
fail.  Other atomic operations such as <asm/bitops.h>, <asm/spinlock.h>
and xchg() <asm/system.h> have the same restriction.
Another trap is that in userspace PIC code may be used while in the kernel
it generally is not used and therefore much of the inline assembler code in
the kernel might fail.
In short, the kernel is a different universe :-)
