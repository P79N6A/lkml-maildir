Yes. Needs a patch to knfsd, but would be very useful for people that
want to export tapes, CD exchangers, etc...

Yes. When we calculate the timeout value, we add the estimated error*4
to the estimated round trip time. I've set a floor on the former value
so that the minumum timeout will be 1/10second.

It is already in 2.6.0. I'm expecting to put it into 2.4.23 too, but I
want to know that this (together with a patch to 'mount' to change the
retrans default) really does solve the problem for people...
