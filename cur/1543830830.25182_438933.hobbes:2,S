Probably the fault of my new ops-ization of rcutorture.c.  :-/
(For whatever it is worth, Dipankar would still be using the older
non-ops-ized version of rcutorture.c.)
Did you get these oopses with default setting of torture_type, or did you
specify torture_type=rcu_bh or torture_type=srcu to the modprobe command?
This was on i386, x86_64, or on something else?
Ah!  This would have been a CONFIG_PREEMPT build, right?
						Thanx, Paul
