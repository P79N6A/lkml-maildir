I'm afraid your concerns about kernel code size eating into buffer
cache or user memory are slightly out of date. These days it seems
damn near impossible to buy anything with less than 32 MB memory!
When we started VxFS development at Veritas in 1990 under contract
to AT&T Bell Labs, one of the design goals/constraints was that it
should be able to run on machines with 4 MB memory. But by the time
we finished release 1.0 one year or so later, the smallest machine
one could buy already had 8 MB memory. Using another 100kB or so of
kernel memory for a good quality file system is a very reasonable
tradeoff. Or would you rather save 100 kB memory and have a file
system that takes 5, 10 or 20 minutes to recover after a crash?
