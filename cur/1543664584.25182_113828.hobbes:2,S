    Hi all, I report this Bug that I've found.
In my configuration  (MSI KT4 Ultra, Athlon 2400+, Geforce 3 Ti200 ) IO 
APIC doesn't give problems (  Only the UNEXPECTED IO APIC message and a 
problem about "Buggy MP Table" that doesn't provide an IRQ (Seems the 
irq of the IDE Controller, but all works correctly...) ) , but if I 
enable ACPI support with the IO APIC the system does not shutdown 
properly in the most of cases , and it reboots instead . Powering off 
the system by the Power Button does not work too.
I use the Linux Kernel 2.4.20 Version and the Debian "Sid" Distribution 
. I've tried the Debian kernel and the "vanilla" one, and both generates 
this error.
I'm lost , I don't know how to solve
Thanks
Bye
Marcello
