Anything that depends upon the extra partitions is going to have a 
difficult time regardless of whether or not they edit /etc/fstab
to change "hda" into "sda" etc..
And libata already has sufficient ioctl compatibility for nearly all
purposes with the old drivers/ide stuff.  Yes, there are some more
esoteric ioctls that I once implemented in drivers/ide that do not
exist for libata, and nobody will miss them.
