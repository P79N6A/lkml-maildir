None that I see in kbuild.git, at least ... Anyway, now that I've silenced
headers_check, I keep seeing:
make[2]: `scripts/unifdef' is up to date.
which is because of the:
make -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=scripts scripts/unifdef
                       (passed separately) ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
from the top-level Makefile (scripts/Makefile says something about it
being built only on demand ...)
