You can (naturally) not avoid the attack and thereby the process from 
crashing - but you can avoid the effects of it. E.g. if you restrict the 
suid-root process form spawning new processes, it would not be able to 
spawn a root shell, programs liks passwd and cdrecord would be good 
candidates to this restriction.

Sure... but not all programs really need access to this. My calendar on 
my PDA for one do not. It (restricting /var) was, as I hope you 
guessed?, an example!
A cool thing is also, that if you restrict the init process from 
accessing a secific directory, then all processes in the system will be 
restricted from this. This will be utilized by Umbrella, to introduce 
signed files (public key cryptography). The area of the public keys will 
be protected by the kernel - simply by restricting Init from this location.
