First try answer on: if OSS specyfications is complet, easy to use in 
applications and generaly compact why reinventing all from this level to 
above on Linux ? why ?
If you answer first on this question you will see: answer 
on your questions do not have sense.
Be compliant with OSS specyfication allow save many time on applications 
development level by consume (in good sense) time spend on this 
applications by *BSD, Solaris and other systems developers (even on not 
open source applications).
After four years ALSA development quality of sound support in Linux is IMO 
on the ~same (still bad) level as four years ago. Still to complicated 
but now more bloated and additionaly not ready for handle fancy gadgets 
like BT headsets.
On other systems (MOX, Win*, Solaris ..) on handle sound situations is now 
better than four years ago. IMO this allow form conclution: generaly 
current ALSA is step back compare to other systems and probaly Linux need 
some deeper work then simple polishing sound device drivers.
More than year Linux in many publications is described as "excelent 
system for mobile gadgets". All waits for this ..
Most of this gadgets want uses sound. Force using ALSA in this are makes 
nightmares not only for drivers developers but also for user space 
applications developers.
(IMO in comming year or two if nothing will change Linux can be visable 
marginalized/can loose current possition .. not because in this period 
Linux will be worse compare to now but because other systems like Solaris, 
MOX and also Win* can pass in this period better progress on bringing some 
valuable functionalities in usable/simpler form for joe-like users .. 
remember: sound support in Linux isn't for data centers/big-ass-machines :)
