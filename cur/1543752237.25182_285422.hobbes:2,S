Though inelegant in theory, SCHED_FIFO *has* been shown to work in
practice.  The POSIX 1003.4 committee were not all a bunch of idiots.
That stuff *is* useful and *does* work (given appropriate privileges).
Your assertions have not been reduced to practice.  This is a
significant difference.  Write some code, then we can discuss whether
it solves any problems or not.  I doubt it, but prove me wrong and
next year you can be the proud author of a scheduler used for hundreds
of audio applications.
Meanwhile, what about 2005?  It's "almost upon us".  :-/
