System is allowed to cache anything unless sync/fsync is called. Someone 
told that XFS has some bugs that if crashed incorrectly, it can lose 
already synced data ... don't know. Plus it has that infamous feature (not 
a bug) that it commits size-increase but not data and you see zero-filed 
files.

Better to list it than quitly depend on it like ext2/fat/reiser/xfs/ 
(maybe jfs?) do.

If you write a file in a directory and the sector is unwritable upon write 
& crash, you lose those few files near it. Just the similar way you would 
lose 4 files in inode table on ext2 in this case.

I have, I may find them and post them. (but the university wants me to 
post them to some conference, so I should keep them secret :-/)
