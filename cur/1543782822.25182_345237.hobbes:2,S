Well I don't want them all at 100% since I do want to be able to have
even levels between the cd, midi and wave, which isn't always the case
at 100%.  They sure sounded worse.
I certainly know some simpler sound cards would have more distrosion
when you ran the amplifiers on the card at 100%.

Bit 16 is used as soon as the signal passes 50%.  After all it is
required when the signal goes past 32767 and is on all the way to 65535.
So at 75% depending on how things are done internally I will be either
using the full range just not amplified to the same amount, or if truly
done entirely digitally, then I will be using 75% of the range, which is
still more than even 15bit could handle (since 15 bit has half the range
of 16bit).

Well that probably helps.
