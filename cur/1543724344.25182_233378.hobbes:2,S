The autotuned swappiness part tended to have the most effect at avoiding 
the morning drag, or the post ISO image copy drag without slowing things 
down under real heavy memory stress.
The original version of autotuned inactivation simply increased the 
number of pages scanned and had better results on my benching but this 
part of code changed somewhat and I dont think I put it back to the best 
way. This patch recreates more closely the behaviour of the original 
version.
It would be nice if people who have tested the previous more confused 
patches to try these two in sequence and see what measurable results 
they give.
Description:
This patch increases the number of active pages inactivated and the 
number of inactive pages freed dependent inversely on the vm_swappiness. 
The vm_swappiness in turn is tuned by the previous patch 
(autotune_swappiness) according to the mapped ratio. As the 
vm_swappiness is proportional to the square root of the mapped ratio, 
this means that the mapped ratio has to be quite high before this patch 
has any great effect.
Patch applies to 2.6.7-bk20 and mm6
