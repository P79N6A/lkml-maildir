I think we mainly lack of documentation. anybody really followed and
understood this thing or perhaps the author ;-) should
write a/update modules.txt for 'module writers' not for users:
- how to update old style to new style; what needs to be changed ?
- what needs to be done to build own modules outside kernel tree ?
- skeleton for new modules
- dos and dont's
Did I miss s.th. ?
