Most people are not arguing that the patch is useless. It isn't, it
prevents accidental destruction of a disk. If it is worth the space in the
kernel for that added layer of protection against brogen programs is for
the kerlen gods to decide.
What it does not do is provide protection against malicious destruction of
a disk. To destroy the disk you need root before the patch and root after
the patch and that is it. The recent proliferation of rather complex
exploits of holes in programs shows that even problems that are hard to
exploit will be exploited. Using direct io to destroy the
bios/disk/whatnot with direct io is not beyond their reach I suspect.
What really annoys me is that software commands can cause permanent damage
without any physical actions on the unit.
