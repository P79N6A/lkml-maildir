this is wrong - it should be doing mask+ack.
also note that you changed:

to:

and you even tried to hide your tracks:

:-)
really, the ->eoi() op should only be called for true fasteoi cases. 
What we want here is to turn the fasteoi handler into a handler that 
does mask+ack and then unmask. Not 'mask+eoi ... unmask' as your patch 
does.
