I have had the same thing happen on a 2.2.15pre15 system though its with a UP
build.  Same system with the same X was stable on 2.2.14.  Assuming this will
happen again, what sort of debug info should I try to gather?  I do have other
boxes that I can telnet into the one that hangs.  BTW its a K6-III 400 with 128M
on a MS5184 MB, matrox Mill 2/250 4MB using the svga server.  Linux is debian,
frozen potato, up-to-date.
