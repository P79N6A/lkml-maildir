Yes, you can do it with an exhaustive trawl of /proc. That can be very
expensive on busy machines.

That doesn't tell you what mounts namespace a process is in - it tells
you what the process can *view* in the namespace.

As I mentioned in another email, nsproxy is fine for things that don't
need explicit configuration or reporting, or which already have
configuration methods (such as fork(), mount(), etc) available, and
which don't need to support movement of processes between different
"namespaces". If it was extended to support the
naming/config/movement, then it would be fine to use it as the
equivalent of a container.
I'd actually be interested in trying to combine my container object
and the nsproxy object into a single concept.
