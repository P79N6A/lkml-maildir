2.3.48, SMP, AIC-7890, NCR 53c810a (using sym53c8xx driver),
CD-ROMs Toshiba XM-3501TA and Toshiba XM-6201TA attached
to 53c810a. Whenever I try to use xmdc to play an audio CD
in XM-3501TA all I get is a lot of SCSI bus resets:

With 2.3.48pre2 there's no resets but xmcd keeps saying "cd busy"
and never plays a sound.
With 2.3.47pre3 all seems to work fine. 2.3.49pre1 - just like 2.3.48.
