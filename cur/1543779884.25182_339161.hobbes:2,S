 Yep, you are right. When used by BIOS/firmware, it is usually 
protected by password. And interesting enough, as in this particular 
case, they employ people to not only read them, but to write them as
well ;)
  However, if not protected by the password, it is probably Ok 
to make it visible (as things currently are).

If your bootloader if the first thing to run in the system, you can 
use & protect portion of your hardrive for yourself - just make sure you
lock with set max with password when passing control to 'normal'
OS/loader.
