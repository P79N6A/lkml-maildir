Subject: [PATCH] 2.2.21pre[234] misreports Pentium II model names
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

In 2.2.21-pre2 through -pre4, many Intel CPUs are misreported in
/proc/cpuinfo and dmesg as Mobile Pentium II's, even when they are
Celerons in desktops or whatever.
In init_intel, the correct CPU name is being assigned to p, but p isn't
being copied into c->x86_model_id. As a result, the name from the tables,
"Mobile Pentium II", is always being used.
This patch (backported from 2.4) fixes the problem. Alan, please apply.
