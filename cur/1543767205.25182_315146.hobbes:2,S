We shall do out best to distribute info to places where it belongs.
A much better approch would be to move all ext2 + ext3 stuff out in
their respective directories.
When modifying xfs (or ext2,ext3) no files outside their respective
directories should in need to be touched - this would just impose
additional burden doing parrallel development.
About your modifications:
Skipping the menu part is OK.
While you are modifying Kconfig in xfs/ put a
if XFS_FS
...
endif
around all config options expcept the one defining the XFS_FS option.
This will fix menu identing.
