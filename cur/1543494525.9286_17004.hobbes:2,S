I've had several discussions with him. He avoids questions about points that
don't fit his pet theory of OS design, he criticises anything that doesn't
follow his theory and often doesnt seem to understand it - eg he didnt
understand the kernel lock in 2.0.x SMP.
Im not sure he's pro NT as pro his pet theory and NT happens to match.
