Should be OK.  The close will not sync anything if someone else has the
blockdev open (ie: there's a filesystem mounted there).
But sync() should certainly write everything out, and lilo does perform a
sync.
I'd be interested in seeing the contents of /proc/meminfo immediately after
the lilo run, see if there's any dirty memory left around.
