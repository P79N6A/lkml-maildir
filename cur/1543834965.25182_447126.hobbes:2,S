Well, I'm not arguing that the fix is a wrong fix.
I'm seeing that, on sparc64-smp arch with debian etch, this patch causes
a very strange sideeffect I was describing in my first mail.
The boot hangs, the cursor (in the framebuffer) stops blinking, nothing
is displayed, and the machine seems frozen until I hit a key or a button
mouse (which is on sparc causing the same interruption), and then the
machine resume the boot sequence as if nothing really happened.
I've been able to isolate that line to be the origin of this behaviour
but it could be as well a bug revealed by this modification.
