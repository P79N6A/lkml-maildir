Agreed.  preempt has me envision various things, none of which are what
we want.  What is the difference between schedule vs preempt? 
Confusing.
What we are calling preempt here is the same as schedule, but we check
if it is needed.  So I suggest conditional_schedule, which has the
benefit of being widely used in at least three patches. 
schedule_if_needed, sched_if_needed, etc. both fit.  Why introduce the
namespace preempt when we already have sched?
sched_conditional() and sched_needed() ?
