It is correct that "make kernelrelease" does not display correct info
until you have done a proper build of the kernel or at least the prepare
step.
The issue here is that we shall avoid sideeffects when running "make
kernelrelease" so it does not trigger all sorts of commands when running
as root for instance.
So the real fix is to error out when .kernelrelease does not exists.
See attached patch.
