Basically, a clean page will just get dropped by the VM, because it knows
it can always re-create the contents. 
So let's assume that you do a large mmap(MAP_SHARED) (or IPC shmem
mapping), and you populate your VM space with pages by just reading from
it. This is not common, but it does happen - things like sparse files
where just the fact that nothing has been written to a certain location is
information in itself.
Now, assume you run out of memory. With your current patch, we'd start
moving these zero-filled pages to the inode cache and write them out:
first we'd drop the entries from the page tables, then we'd call
"writepage()" to write the page to disk.
If, instead, you don't mark the page dirty immediately, but you wait until
somebody does a write, or until the VM layer informs you through the
"swapout()" function that somebody had a dirty page table entry, what
would happen is that (because nobody actually wrote to the page yet) it
would just get dropped from the VM space, and writepage() would never be
called.

I did not have time to give it a good check, and "reasonable" is the
highest praise I'll give without having checked that there aren't any real
gotchas.
I certainly think that this is the right way to do things. I haven't had
time to check whether it's perfect.
