Yes.

Yes, I think the race is:
	1. generic_setlease(., F_WRLCK, .) checks d_count and i_count,
	   both are 1.
	2. a read open comes in, calls break_lease which finds no lease
	   and continues happily on.
	3. generic_setlease() sets the write lease.
The most likely consequences are that a local reader gets out-of-date
data for a file that a Samba client has modified.
I suppose that re-checking the d_count and i_count after step 3 might
close the race.

Yes.  What it's supposed to do is provide exclusion between opens and
write leases.
We already have a mechanism that provides exclusion between write opens
and exec, using the i_writecount, so we're using that for read leases.
I suppose it'd be possible to do something similar for write leases;
would there be smp scalability problems associated with counting all the
read opens of a given inode?  Other problems?
Even with this problem solved, I'm not convinced write leases are very
useful as implemented.  Their only current user is Samba, which uses
them to grant exclusive access to given files to allow clients to cache
writes.
Samba knows when to revoke that exclusive access because the lease
subsystem signals it on a read open of the file.  It doesn't revoke on
stat, however.  This causes problem.  E.g., say Samba takes out a lease
and tells some client it can now cache its writes indefinitely.
Meanwhile a local application (say, make) is polling that file for
changes using stat.  They never see those changes.
The NFSv2/v3 server for some reason has its own one-off hack that
reports the ctime as now for on any write-leased file, which leads
people to complain about spurious rebuilds:
	
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9454
The one thing I suspect is *not* a really serious problem here is the
reported LTP failure, since probably the only user of this is Samba,
which probably doesn't do a lot of tmpfs exports, and in any case it can
probably soldier on (if with degraded performance--how badly I don't
know) without getting the write lease it wants.
