thanks, applied.
btw., if there's any file you are particularly interested in cleaning up 
as a whole, you can use the --file option:
  scripts/checkpatch.pl --file include/asm-x86/pgtable_64.h
there's no hard policy on whether cleanups should be done 
pre-unification or post-unification. I've been using the following 
pretty sensible 3-step path when doing manual unifications:
- clean up the _32 and _64 file first (this is also easy to check - the 
  resulting .o or vmlinux must not differ with/without the patch)
- remove artificial differences (in a separate patch)
- do the unification (in a third patch)
the general rule, more patches are better than fewer patches. Most of 
our testing/bisetion infrastructure is per-patch/per-commit, so if some 
mistake happens (and mistakes happen all the time), the finer grained 
approach is always easier to sort out.
