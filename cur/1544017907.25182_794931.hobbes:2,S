I checked, its size effects were miniscule [0.17%] on the x86 defconfig 
kernel and it seems to be a clear loss in total cost as there would be an 
ongoing maintenance cost of this weird new variant of C that language 
lawyers legislated out of thin air and which departs so significantly from 
time-tested C coding concepts and practices.
We'd have to work around aliasing warnings of the compiler again and again 
with no upside and in fact i'd argue that the resulting code is _less_ 
clean.
The lack of data processing complexity in the kernel is not a surprise: 
the kernel is really just a conduit/abstractor between hw and apps, and 
rarely generates genuinely new information. (In fact it can be generally 
considered a broken system call concept if such data processing _has_ to 
be conducted somewhere in the kernel.)
( Notable exceptions would be the crypto code and the RAID5 [XOR checksum]
  and RAID6 [polinomial checksums] code - but those tend to be seriously
  hand-optimized already, with the most critical bits written in assembly. )
