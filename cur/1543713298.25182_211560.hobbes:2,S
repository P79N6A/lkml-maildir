I must apologize.  I had thought the context was SCSI, but now I
see that it is linux-ide.  So please disregard comments about command
queueing.  If you have write cache disabled and no TCQ (latter is common,
former may or may not be), you want to write as big a chunk as you can.
I'm sorry about the confusion.
