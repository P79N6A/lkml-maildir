No, I was being sarcastic. There's no text below your quotation in this
mail from you either. It's all at the top. Please don't do that.
You are still violating

If you really only need it to be read-only, and assuming NOR flash, then
cramfs on a flash device sounds like a sane option. If you have NAND
flash then it's slightly more complicated -- you probably need a real
writable file system which deals with NAND but you could use it in
read-only mode.

Why? Where would these ramdisks be loaded from in the first place?
Wouldn't you do better to use them directly from there rather than
copying them into precious RAM?
