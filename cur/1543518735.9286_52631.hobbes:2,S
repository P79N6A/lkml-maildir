Hmmm this is quite neat, my posting was of course based on the
assumption that the bus controller was simple ... doesn't change the
fact that the ESS Solo1 is a pile of j**k ;-)

This would be good for low end devices that don't do scatter/gather
themselves - I seem to remember some of the frame grabber ones have
this problem.

Right, this should of course be combined with generic scatter/gather
support in important places like the skbuffs (through the use of
kiobufs). Some well designed hardware (like some modern network cards)
already supports this .... and it would solve a lot of problems for
the HIPPI and Fibre Channel drivers.
