> o Beta       Serial driver restructure              (Russell King)
Regarding the above line from the 2.5 STATUS report, what is the nature of
the planned restructuring?  I have a CompactPCI hot swap serial mux card
that I need to support with hot swap functionality on Linux.  Has anybody
already worked on issues like locking port names to physical slots, etc.?
Any basic advice?
Thanks in
Ed Vance
