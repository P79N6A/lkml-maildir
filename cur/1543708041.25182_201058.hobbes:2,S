The last public release we made of the SH-5 tools is available at
    
ftp://ftp.uk.superh.com/pub/SuperH-GNU/Barcelona-20030414
This URL provides further information:
    
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1984379&forum_id=9482
The SH-5 tools we're currently using in-house are a few months more
advanced than those.  (They date from about August 2003.)  We'd be happy
to package this version up and make it available if people express
interest in this.
BTW, if anyone who's using the 2003_04_14 release has found any
problems, please do let me know and I'll pass the information on to the
toolchain guys.
