I just jump into a thread somewhere to ask my question :-)
Why does the list have to be in userspace?
As I see it there can only be a problem when some thread has done
FUTEX_WAIT and is blocked. If no task is blocked (or on it's way to
being blocked) there is no problem. 
The solution I could imagine was the FUTEX_WAIT operation adds the
waiting task to a list of waiters attached to the mutex owner's task_t
(which is known by it's pid in the userspace flag) just before calling
schedule(). This list needs to be protected by a spinlock, ofcourse.
When a task dies it can wake up the waiters on it's list without relying
on the userspace.
What race conditions have I missed?
