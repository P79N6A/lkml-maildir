I quickly coded this up and ran my tests again. Unfortunately, the
results are negative. I printk'd the state of the unfrozen task and 
this is how the serial console output looks like:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stopping user space processes timed out after 20 seconds (7 tasks
refusing to freeze)
make:TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
make:TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
make:TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
make:TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
make:TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
make:TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
make:TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE
Restarting tasks ... done.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I couldn't see any reduction in the number of
freeze-failures. Thus Ingo right.  These failures are due
to the TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE tasks which fail to freeze within the
timeout period and not because of the fork race.

The other option would be to have another state equivalent to 
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE_NOFREEZE, so that Ingo's solution can be applied
for regular TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE tasks. Thus TASK_UNINTERRUPTBLE tasks
from a for_each_online_cpu context should now do a
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE_NOFREEZE instead. 
Hmm, lots of audit and hence defeats the purpose.
