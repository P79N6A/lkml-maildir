There are races with serious consequences, and ones without.
That we have race conditions is no excuse to be adding more!
I never did claim that /proc would provide an atomic snapshot.
I don't even claim that the race conditions are because of
your code, but you were passing up an opportunity to fix a few.
As long as there is a way to determine all tasks belonging
to a POSIX process (TIDs in a TGID, or whatever) without
reading damn near everything, then things can be sane.

All or nothing? I would value a few improvements.
Thread directories are one. Alternately, add per-task lists
of tasks with the same VM or a mapping file.
I just went looking for that syscall which was supposed to
allow opening a file relative to a directory file descriptor.
Hmmm, not there. Was that one shot down for some security
concern related to file descriptor passing? It would help
with the process death and PID-wrap-around races at least.
Per-task UUID values could help. Reset one on exec, and one
for every operation that would set an existing ID.

There are many problems, some of which are hard.
