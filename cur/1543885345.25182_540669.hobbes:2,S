I had a short look at ALSA and it looks like it is a little bit too
focussed towards "normal" audio. For example, if follows an asynchronous
model in the sense that an application can read/write to a buffer at any
time, taken that the ringbuffer doesn't overflow. That's not enough for
example for control applications; you need the option for real
synchronous operation there.
IMHO we need an API which offers
- kernel ring buffers (to make it sure no data gets lost)
- generic data types (streaming plain ADC values is just the simplest
  case; we also have for example streaming FPGA data containing 
  preprocessed data sets)
- optional timestamping for each sample
- zero-copy from hardware into userspace memory, with DMA support
- application notification every N samples (N >= 1)
v4l2 may also be worth a look; but in the end I suppose they are all
specialized sub-cases of what we'd need for fast DAQ.
