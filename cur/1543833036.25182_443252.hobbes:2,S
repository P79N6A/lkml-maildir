Silence is probably an indication that the VFS does not provide hooks.
The question then:
1. Would it be difficult to introduce perMount Handler hooks into the VFS?
2. Would it be easier to replace the current VFS with one that offers a more 
flexible/open configuration?
3. Would these changes be welcome, or is the VFS considered to be a forbidden 
zone?
Thanks!
