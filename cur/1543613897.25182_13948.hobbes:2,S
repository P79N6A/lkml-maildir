   And using lkml as a AIO forum is probably outside of the scope of this list
   and group.
This whole thread exists because Linus wants public general and
technical discussion on lkml of new features to happen before he
considers putting them into the tree, and the fact that they are not
in the tree because he isn't seeing such enthusiastic discussions
happening at all.
I don't think AIO, because of it's non-trivial impact to the tree, is
at all outside the scope of this list.  This is in fact the place
where major stuff like AIO is meant to be discussed, not some special
list where only "AIO people" hang out, of course people on that list
will be enthusiastic about AIO!
Frankly, on your other comments, I don't give a rats ass what BSD/OS
people are doing about, nor how highly they rate, Java.  That is
neither here nor there.  Java is going to be dead in a few years, and
let's just agree to disagree about this particular point ok?
