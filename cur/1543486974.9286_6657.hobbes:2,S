Hi folks!
I have some problems compiling the 2.2.1 kernel with 2.2.2-pre5 patches applied.
The problem occurs with socket filtering enabled. Error messages follow, 
.config is also included. I use the egcs-2.91.60 for compiling on a 
Dual PPro 200 system with 128 MB Ram.
These are the errors (all other messages are deleted):
