Is it the mapping of the pages that bothers you? If using alloc_pages_node()
is the preferred way, I certainly can make the change. But if I do there is
a greater potential that we may have to return failure to the caller of
gen_pool_add(), that is if we can't get the necessary number of contiguous
pages. Now granted the likelyhood that anyone would require more than a
page for a bitmap is very very small. I'd say the vast majority of callers
will end up using kmalloc_node(). I can go either way, just let me know
whether I should make the change or not.

The comment block preceding smp_call_function() says that it returns "0 on
success, else a negative status code". So regardless of whether the current
implementation for a given architecture is always returning 0 is probably
irrelevant since that could change tommorrow. So now I'm thinking I should
restore the check for an error return, something I will do in the next
version of this patch.

I thought of this, but if this patch were separated out then the remaining
patch would be dependent on it since the uncached allocator is being
changed to call sn_flush_all_caches() with an uncached address.
It certainly could be done, but is it worth the effort? Let me know
how I should proceed with this.
Thanks,
Dean
