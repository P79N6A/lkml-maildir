Ever since we upgraded to 2.2.17, we've had a lot of scsi related
problems, including a kernel lockup. These are the only messages I've
successfully been able to log:

This is more or less meaningless to me. I was wondering if this is a known
problem, or I might have faulty hardware.. We're using an Asus P3B-DS with
an AccuRAID 8600 controller hooked up to a 90 gig array.
I can't remember any of the other errors other than a big list of sg[0]
.. sg[9] or something.. Only the raid controller and a onstream ADR 50
tape drive are connected to scsi.
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
