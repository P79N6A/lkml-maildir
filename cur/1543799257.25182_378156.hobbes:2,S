Greetings;
I just noted my toolbar clock was off by about 45 minutes, with
an uptime on -rc6 or 27hrs & change.
A service ntpd restart resets it, but thats temporary.  
Apic is on, and a cat of /proc/interrupts returns this:
          CPU0
  0:   96565780    IO-APIC-edge  timer

But when I looked at the log, it was synched to LOCAL.  I have a script
to enhance the logging, runs at 30 minute intervals, and it was logging 
this:

That drift is slightly lower than normal, its usually in the 4.x's.
This is with the newest bios update, which fixed this problem for -rc5.
Looks like reboot time, to -rc5. :(

People having trouble with vz bouncing email to me should add the word
'online' between the 'verizon', and the dot which bypasses vz's
stupid bounce rules.  I do use spamassassin too. :-)
