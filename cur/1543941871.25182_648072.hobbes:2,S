Commit c40a22e0ce5eb400f27449e59e43d021bee58b8d aka
"PCI: Fix bus resource assignment on 32 bits with 64b resources"
renders one tg3-equipped box networkless here.
	tg3.c:v3.87 (December 20, 2007)
	tg3: (0000:02:05.0) phy probe failed, err -19
	tg3: Problem fetching invariants of chip, aborting.
	tg3: (0000:02:05.1) phy probe failed, err -19
	tg3: Problem fetching invariants of chip, aborting.
It's 32-bit CONFIG_RESOURCES_64BIT=y box.
Not sure what you need this, but below is some lspci -vvvxxx output:
