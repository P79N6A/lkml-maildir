Speaking from the perspective of a long time computer user and sys-admin, I'm 
trying to understand life without a partition table.
I operate under the following assumptions:
1. It's useful to have a physical disk divided into multiple logical disks.
2. It's therefore important that the bootloader know about them, assuming that 
we want to be able to boot from any logical disk.
3. We can either have the bootloader spend time divining the structure of the 
logical disks by scanning the physical disk or we can write it down in some 
useful place.
4. That useful place is very near the front of the physical disk.
Of course, I'd be the first to admit that the current partition table is a 
stupid design, but I can't see not having one at all.
