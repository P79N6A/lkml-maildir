There is: platform_driver_probe(). It takes the probe function as a
parameter so that it can be left out of the platform_driver struct.
After it returns, there are no references to the probe function left
around, so if you call platform_driver_probe() instead of
platform_driver_register(), the probe function can be __init.
I agree that the driver is not safe in its current form.
