Hello Andrew,
If in the kernprof data you find "fget" as one of the high rankers (say in top
10) then can you try the scalable FD management patch which uses 
read-copy-update mechanism for protecting files_struct. 
As of now there are working patches available for read-copy-update mechanism 
and FD management at "
http://lse.sourceforge.net/locking/rclock.html"
 as 
rclock-2.4.2-01.patch and files_struct_rcu-2.4.2-03.patch but we are working on 
simpler interfaces. Also let me know if you need the patches for a different 
2.4 kernel version.
