    <thumps table> 2.6 will support a large dev_t.
    We need to make this happen.

    This precisely illustrates my point.
    mknod64() and several other dev_t patches (ext2 and ext3 support,
    especially) have stalled in -mm for months.  The reason why I have not
    moved ahead with them is that I am waiting to see the rest of the work.
That is what they call a deadlock.
You asked a few times what parts could be submitted and I answered.
    Because it could be that Al has different ideas, or that someone else gets
    down and completes the work and wants to do it differently.  I simply do
    not know.
Neither do I. I just wait and see.
