    Ditto.
Actually; Ethernet badly needs something like this too. I would kill
to be able to do something like:
	ifconfig eth0 speed 100 duplex full
o across different networks cards -- I've been thinking about it of
late as I had to battle with this earlier this week; depending on
what network card you use, you need different magic incarnations to
do the above.
A standard interface is really needed; unless anyone objects I may
look at drafting something up -- but it will require some input if it
is not to look completely Ethernet centric.
