Subject: Getting file offsets for open files of a process?

lsof has this option:
       -o       This option directs lsof to display  file  offset
                at all times.  It causes the SIZE/OFF output col­
                umn title to be changed to OFFSET.
but the source contains
#define	OFFTST_STAT	0		/* Linux lsof can't report offsets */
That information is not available in /proc either.
(I'm not sure if the older, non-/proc based lsof version supported this on
linux. Newest lsof has the non-/proc linux mode removed, and I can't find
the old source anymore.)
Is there any way of getting this information in linux?
I suppose Solaris and maybe some others export this information via /proc?
