/sys/fs used to exist for for some. Moreover, /sys/fs/foofs/ was added
automagically when foofs file system type was registered. But it was
ultimately removed, because nobody took the time to fix all races
between accessing /sys/fs/foofs/gadget and
umount/filesystem-module-unloading. 
Another way is to implement special "control" file-system type (using
fs/libfs.c functions), to be used like
mount -tfoofs /device /mnt/point
mount -tfoo_ctrlfs -o host=/mnt/point /mnt/control-point
Again, nobody took the time to actually do this for any real
file-system, as far as I know.
