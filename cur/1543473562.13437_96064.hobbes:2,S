There is no need to. In many countries, I assume all, legal texts are
deamed purely functional - i.e. they can not be copyrighted. If you have a
contract you are free to reuse the text in it for another purpose. The
name "gpl" may be protected so you can't call your modified license GPL.
Then again, it would not be the GPL so why call it that?
