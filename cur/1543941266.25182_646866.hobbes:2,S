artswrapper is setuid root and RLIMIT_RTPRIO is apparently not used.
Still, artswrapper is running as a regular user, so it most probably drops
privileges early.
BTW, it fails while running the artsmessage utility used for displaying arts
error messages, so I guess there's an error in arts that this thing tries to
display and deadlocks (or something like that).
Should I test the patch nevertheless?
