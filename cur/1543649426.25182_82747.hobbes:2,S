I think the original patch was the best, setting sensible defaults - as
we can make that code __init so it is free. I merged the other fixes and
made the GEODE CPU choice set OOSTORE. That means what is needed now is
to drop in the code to set the CPU to writeback, and also the code to
check that the mmio space is actually beyond 1Gbyte
