I place in nomination:
	tasksets
However this would conflict with the taskset utility in Robert Loves
schedutils package.  The 'taskset' command "is used  to set or retrieve
the CPU affinity of a running process given its PID or to launch a new
COMMAND with a given CPU affinity."
The various alternatives you listed all have the advantage of stating
both that we have a container/group/set/collection/... of something,
and -what- that something might be - process/resource/task/...
"tasksets" is the shortest spelling I could think of for such a compond
"Something-Collection" form.
If the conflict with the schedutils utility is a concern, then the
next best alternative would be:
	taskgroups
This is the next shortest way to spell this "Something-Collection" form.
