Will then every d be passed as separate parameter to hotplug? It means agent 
has to deal with unknown number of parameters or are there always fixed 
number of devs? apparently not as max is 8 and in your example only 3 are 
defined.
If number is variable I guess better would be
	alias pnp:cXXXXXXdYYYYYYY[:YYYYYY...]
i.e. put all devs IDs in one field; actually may be even separator is 
redundant as IDs have strict format to my knowledge.
Then hotplug agent gets two parameters - PNPID and PNPDEVS - and it is quite 
easy to build alias.
can you give example how entries in sysfs look like (I do not have any ISA 
card). Is it possible to list them in the same order as in pnp_card_device_id 
table? Otherwise coldplugging becomes quite complicated. coldplugging script 
has to build the same string as hotplug invocation gets.
Oh, BTW, what are those `@' in your example? If they mean single char 
wildcard, you should build them using `?' because modprobe is using normal 
fnmatch to match module name against aliases.
thank you
