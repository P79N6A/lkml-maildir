Well, if you aren't compiling for an IBM 40x board, PPC405_ERR77 should
be defined to nothing.  And it also looks like the O(1) scheduler patch
you're trying lacks complete PPC support.  I would again suggest that
you use 2.4.18 or 2.4.19 and whichever O(1) patch applies to that, as I
think I've seen people using O(1) on PPC under 2.4.
