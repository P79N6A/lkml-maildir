This seems like a winning idea to me.

But why would we ever want to use an LRU list for write-outs?
It would be much better to sort the buffers in the order they're
occupying on the disk, that'll give the lower layers a better
chance of doing some I/O clustering and will reduce search times,
improve throughput, etc...
We can always free the clean buffers in LRU order later on.
