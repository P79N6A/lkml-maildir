Taking the least significant bits of a fast timer between keypresses is a
very good way of generating entropy. I'd trust it more than some unknown
hardware generator. The same is true of network packets.
The key is to have a timer that is much faster than the network or
keyboard interfaces. There must also be a _minimal_ amount of "jitter" to
the keypresses or packet arrival times -- in practice it would probably be
extremely difficult to make the times regular enough to attack the RNG.
That's all it takes to make some of the least significant timer bits a
good source of entropy.
