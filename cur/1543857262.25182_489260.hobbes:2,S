Yes. Passing in a struct device allows you a link between the device and 
the class. If you pass in the device for the parport a link to the parport 
device would exist in you displayX directory. The devdata is used by the 
probe function to get data about the monitor if it is not NULL.
In the case of most desktop monitors they have EDID blocks. You can 
retrieve them (devdata) and it gets parsed thus you have detail data
about the monitor. In your case it can be null.

The probe function gets this for you. In your case you would have a probe 
method that would just fill in the name of the LCD. For me using the ACPI 
video driver I get the name for my monitor
LEN  15"XGA 200nit
Which is the manufacturer - monitor id - ascii block.

I suggest creating a group for your driver. See device.h for 
group_attributes.

Yes. I need it for the ACPI video and fbdev layer. Remember its in the 
early stages yet.

Did you solve the problem?
