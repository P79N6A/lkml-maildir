That wouldn't fix configs without hrtimers.
The linux manpage reflects current behaviour:
from man2/poll.2.gz
"The timeout argument specifies an upper limit on the time for which
poll() will block, in milliseconds."
To achieve "at least" timeouts we'd have to add a jiffy's ms to the
timeout in userspace.
I'd like to let sys_poll() behave according to posix's manpage:
from man3p/poll.3p.gz
"poll() shall wait at least timeout milliseconds"
Thats easier to specify in userspace. No need to know the running kernel's
HZ.
Above posix/linux difference also shows in select() manpages.
epoll_wait() (linux only) manpage also says "maximum time of timeout"
A more complete patch would tweek (p)poll (p)select and epoll_(p)wait.
There are possibly more syscalls affected that I'm not aware off.
Is there upstream interest?
