He has this one covered.  The patch puts preemption locks around
read_locks.
By the by, if a preemption lock is all that is needed the patch defines
it and it is rather fast (an inc going in and a dec & test comming
out).  A lot faster than a spin lock with its "LOCK" access.  A preempt
lock does not need to be "LOCK"ed because the only contender is the same
cpu.
