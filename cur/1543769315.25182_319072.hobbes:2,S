A semaphore would also be the wrong approach since we don't want
processes to block but instead to fail opening the watchdog twice.
Other watchdog drivers use atomic_t or bitops to guard open, which
imho would be the better solution.
Of course, there is also Wim's plan to do a unified watchdog driver
that would solve this once and for all.

Right.
Utz, do you have time to fix up these issues? If not, I probably won't
look into it this week either.
