And yet the kenrel works when built on one machine?
I'd love to see what the differences are. If the .config etc are all 100%
the same, I'd like to see what "diff" reports on the generated vmlinux
files (well, to be honest, I'd need either both files on some web-site, or 
you to actually run diff and find _where_ the differences are).
