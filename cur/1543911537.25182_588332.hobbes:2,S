i did point out that grepping the tree shows plenty of results ... if
this one is not satisfactory, you're free to grep to locate ones that
are
the code we're using is used to initialize a data structure ... you
can find similar things in:
./sound/ppc/tumbler.c
./sound/pci/emu10k1/p16v.c
./sound/pci/hda/patch_realtek.c
./sound/pci/hda/patch_si3054.c
./sound/usb/usbquirks.h
./sound/oss/sscape.c
and then i hit ctrl+c
