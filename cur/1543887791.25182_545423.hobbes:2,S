Well, "needs fixing" is a bit strong.
It's a scary message for something we've always handled, and that we still 
handle fine, we just complain about it.
So we'll probably just turn the message off for 2.6.22, but in the 
meantime, we leave it on and try to fix as many of these as we can be 
bothered to.
