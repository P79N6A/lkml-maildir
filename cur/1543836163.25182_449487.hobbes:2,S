OK, thanks! I wasn't completely realizing that the fixup runs
after an exception handler is already returned. Now it all looks
pretty obvious. :)

Yes, be there a possibility the set the *constant* limit (THREAD_SIZE),
I'd certainly do that, no questions. But as long as we are talking
about the nasty non-constant limit like regs->esp+THREAD_SIZE*2, is it
really worth an efforts? This limit is very unpredictable. I'll have
to add the code to deal with granularity. And its still very, very
permissive. Not even nearly something like just THREAD_SIZE.
Do you really, really think it is worth all the headache?
