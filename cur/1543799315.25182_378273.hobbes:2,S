The attached patch will poison the user-to-kernel stack with the letters
'Q', starting on each page boundary. It does one page only so it will
work with any sized stack. One can run the machine with the usual
work, then do:
# cat /dev/mem | strings >junk.dat
Somebody, if interested, could make a program that looks for a string
of 'Q's starting on each page boundary reading /dev/kmem. Anyway,
using `vim` and searching for "QQQQQQQQQQQQQQ", you can see how
much of the existing stack is being used. A cursory check shows that,
out of every instance of a string of such poison, the smallest string
was about 48 bytes and the largest was too many to bother to count.
This shows that there is (probably) about 48 bytes of overhead when
using 1 page stacks.
The mailer screws up patches not attached, but here is one
in the foreground for review. It is running on this system so
it doesn't break anything (probably slows syscalls down, though).
