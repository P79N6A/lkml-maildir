Hi,
I made some optimizations on racache in nfsd in test10. The idea is to
replace with existing fixed length table for readahead cache in NFSD with a
hash table.
The old racache is essentially ineffective in dealing with large # of
files, and yet eats CPU cycles in scanning the table (even though the table
is small),
the hash table-based is much more effective and fast. I have generated the
patch for test10 and tested it.
