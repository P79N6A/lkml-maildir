I know. But you we're the one who started this off. The 'beast' should be
maintained by people that need it. And it was just a brainstorm, moreover.

What exactly relies on _devfs_?

As far as I remember the devfs maintainer didn't do just a one-liner of changes
plus he was not to be reached by mail. No reply, no list acitivity, ... nothing.
Just out of the town.

This thread will start something, yes. But I don't think we will have a decision
in the end. The kernel grows. In size, in features, in just about anything. And
from a developers point of view it's always wise to re-write a subsystem with a
new API and the freedom to do _whatever_ one thinks she could do than re-write a
subsystem due to maintaining the interface for compatibility.
The two cases exactly are:
	* _new_ code with all new features planned
	or
	* _partly new_ code with some new features due to API incompatibility a la
	  'what we have to do is to get the best we can from what we have'
And the latter is definitely the wrong way to go. Just my 2 cents...
