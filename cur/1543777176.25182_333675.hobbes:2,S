Nice work - thanks.
A couple of possible additions:
 * Keep lines within 80 columns.
 * Be consistent in use of tabs versus spaces.  If the
   rest of a file is indented using tabs, then any change
   you make should be indented the same way, not with
   spaces.  It is easy to unknowingly introduce spaces in
   a patch by cutting and pasting something in one of the
   many desktop UI environments that dont preserve tabs
   across a cut and paste.
 * See also Documentation/kernel-doc-nano-HOWTO.txt for
   formatting the documentation for external functions
   and data to work with the kernels DocBook automatically
   extractable documentation.
 * Multiline comments are shown as:
	/*
	 * This is a big comment.  It is full of sound
	 * and fury, signifying nothing. Now is the time
	 * for all good men to come to the aid of their
	 * country.
