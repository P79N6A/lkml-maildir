Subject: smp-2.3.18-F8: missing synchronization for console_loglevel

arch/i386/kernel/traps.c contains 2 functions which access console_loglevel
without synchronization.
I think you should acquire the console_lock spinlock before changing these
variables.
see linux/kernel/printk.c, do_syslog().
Note that the spinlock calls around "console_loglevel=minimum_loglevel" were
added to be on the safe side: console_loglevel is not atomic_t, and I don't
want to assume that setting a 32-bit value is atomic for all architectures.
