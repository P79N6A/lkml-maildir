Kumar,
in our department we have Linux 2.6 kernel ports for Kontron embedded computer boards with freescale processors 8245, 405, 8540, 8541, 8347, 8270, ...
We would like to start now to submit all these board supports to the vanilla kernel.
For the start we would select one of our common boards, e.g. the one with 8540/8541 processor.
My question is now:
Should we try to provide a patch with all HW-features of the board supported, or would it be better to start with a minimalistic patch, and then add support for additional devices onboard (e.g. IDE, RTC, SuperIO, ...) time by time ?
Or would it be better to provide the full feature set of this board at one time ?
Mit freundlichen Gruessen / Best regards
