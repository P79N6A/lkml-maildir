Note that trashing don't necessarily mean the cpu is free.
It can be very busy:
- deciding what to swap out next
- queuing stuff up for io, merging long elevator queues
- handling io operations, we don't all have busmastering devices
somehow I don't think garbage collection runs will be that fun
in a trashing situation.  Don't these algorithms look all over
your stack & heap for pointers?  That will surely cause lots
of io as all the apps memory is paged in so the gc algorithm
may look at it.
