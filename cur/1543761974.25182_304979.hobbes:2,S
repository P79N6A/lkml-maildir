It is: It takes place right away. But it is not non-deterministic when
_all_ readers actually read it. Also the cleanup is non-deterministic.
So unless you actually _wait_ for the cleanup to happen instead of
defering it you can safely do RCU writes in a RT-task.

Remember to boost the writer such RT tasks can enter read regions. I must
also warn against the dangers: A lot of code where a write-lock is taken 
need to marked as non-deterministic, i.e. must not-be called from
RT-tasks (maybe put a WARN_ON(rt_task(current)) in the write-lock
operation?)

I don't find it crazy. I think it is elegant - but also dangerous as it
might take a long time.
