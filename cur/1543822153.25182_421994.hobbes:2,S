Subject: [PATCH] PCI Bus Parity Status-broken hardware attribute, EDAC foundation
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

PATCH against the 2.6.17-rc3 release.
Currently, the EDAC (error detection and correction) modules that are in the kernel
contain some features that need to be moved. After some good feedback on the PCI
Parity detection code and interface
(
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0603.1/0897.html
) this patch ADDs an
new attribute to the pci_dev structure: Namely the 'broken_parity_status' bit. 
When set this indicates that the respective hardware generates false positives of
Parity errors.
The EDAC "blacklist" solution was inferior and will be removed in a future patch.
Also in this patch is a PCI quirk.c entry for an Infiniband PCI-X card which
generates false positive parity errors.
I am requesting comments on this AND on the possibility of a exposing this
'broken_parity_status' bit to userland via the PCI device sysfs directory for
devices. This access would allow for enabling of this feature on new devices and for
old devices that have their drivers updated. (SLES 9 SP3 did this on an ATI
motherboard video device). There is a need to update such a PCI attribute between
kernel releases. 
This patch just adds a storage place for the attribute and a quirk entry for a known
bad PCI device. PCI Parity reaper/harvestor operations are in EDAC itself and will
be refactored to use this PCI attribute instead of its own mechanisms (which are
currently disabled) in the future.
