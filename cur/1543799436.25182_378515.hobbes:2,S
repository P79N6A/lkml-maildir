this is basically in direct conflict with what Linus has been asking
for.. "leave semaphore semantics alone".
I agree with Linus that if it has very different rules, it should have a
different name.

semaphores have had a lot of work for the last... 10 years. To me that
is a sign that maybe they're close to their limit already.
You keep saying 10 times "so please enhance semaphores to do this".
Semaphores have far more complex rules for the slowpath (mutex semantics
are simple because the number of wakers is always at most one, and if
you hold the lock, you KNOW nobody else can do another release under
you). Adding dual rules or other complexity to it doesn't sound too
compelling to me actually; they're highly tricky things already (just
look at the i386 ones.. that extra wakeup was there to plug a hole (at
least that is my empirical conclusion based on "we remove it it hangs"
behavior).
Having 2 sets of behaviors for the same primitive also sounds not good
to me to be honest, that's bound to explode stuff left and right all the
time.
I realize you're not looking forward to a gradual conversion; yet Linus
says he doesn't want a wholesale change either but wants it gradual.
