so much for the first guess. try modifying the initrd to pop open an interactive
shell that you can use before it actually fails. You can poke around and see
what's going on. Depending on how it's set up, you might be able to get away
with something this simple in the linuxrc:
	/bin/sh </dev/console >/dev/console 2>/dev/console
If you ramdisk has strace and some other use utilities, it might help you track
down the bad apple.
