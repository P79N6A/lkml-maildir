(yes, vertical axis is MB per second)
is what my measurement tool makes of my new Maxtor drive. This just
reads a megabyte and prints 1/<time it took> .
The "vertical" stripes are probably moments where WE tried to do
something else with the machine. This run was not a "professional 
measurement" where we had allotted time to do the measurement, but 
"lets see what disk can do while we continue to work normally".
