Subject: RFHelp:  Splitting MAINTAINERS into maintainers/* and Makefile/Kconfig support
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've got a tree with a directory full of separate
MAINTAINER blocks that looks like:
00_file_description
3c359_network_driver
3c505_network_driver
3c59x_network_driver
3cr990_network_driver
...
zd1211rw_wireless_driver
zf_machz_watchdog
zr36067_video_for_linux_driver
zs_decstation_z85c30_serial_driver
zz_the_rest
A little more than 600 files
So that distributions could continue to produce
a MAINTAINERS block if desired, how could
make be extended to produce such a file from
these individual blocks?
Maybe:
        "cat [0-9a-z]* > ../MAINTAINERS"?
Would it need to?
Anyone have suggestions for Makefile/Kconfig support?
