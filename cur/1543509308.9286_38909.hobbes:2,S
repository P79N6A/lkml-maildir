   It's triggered by having the iso_directory_entrys describing a file
   go across more than one block, with a empty record at the end of
   the first block.  There's code to handle that case, but it's
   slightly wrong.
My bad, I messed this up when converting the isofs code to the
new page cache changes in 2.3.x, 2.2.x does it correctly.
