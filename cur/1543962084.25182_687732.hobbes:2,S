Hm - if it breaks the robotic stuff, there could be a real 
"v2.6.26-merge" git tag which shouldn't break like "v2.6.26-rc1".
It could look like this:
- tag v2.6.25
- drink a beer
- tag v2.6.26-merge
- pull the new stuff from subsystem maintainers
- tag v2.6.26-rc1
- ...
For me a 2.6.25-gitX looks like a snapshot that leads to a 2.6.25.1 and 
_not_ to a 2.6.26-rc1. The current 2.6.25-git16 is moch more a 2.6.26 
than a 2.6.25. So v2.6.26-merge-git16 makes it much clearer what's going 
on here.
To tag Linus' tree with v2.6.26-merge before pulling all the new 2.6.26 
stuff seems therefore reasonable to me. But maybe i don't have all the 
dependencies on my radar.
