Subject: mm kernel oops with r8169 & named, PREEMPT

This is with the network driver r8169 and linux-2.6.9-rc4-mm1.  Same
thing happened with linux-2.6.9-rc3-mm3 (but also locked up). 
linux-2.6.8.1-mm4 didn't seem to have this problem.  This is very
repeatable, if this is an unknown issue let me know (CC please, not on
the list) and I will jump through the hoops to get a useful oops.
