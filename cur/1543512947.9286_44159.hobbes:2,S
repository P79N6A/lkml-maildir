   I imagine the list is not dead, but ... why am I not receiving any msgs ??
   The 'which' command returns to me saying that I'm  subscribed, so ...
Your site is spitting back bounces like that below, this is
why you aren't receiving any postings.  I have unsubscribed
you until you correct this because it's spamming my mailbox.

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at mail001.mediacity.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.
<lists@cyclades.com>:
Sorry. Although I'm listed as a best-preference MX or A for that host,
it isn't in my control/locals file, so I don't treat it as local. (#5.4.6)

I have a very odd problem.  I would appreciate it if someone was able to
help me.  If I do a tcpdump of packets on my local network here at home with
my laptop, it works fine.  But on the other hand, if I do a tcpdump of
packets on the local network at school with my laptop, it doesn't always
work.  Sometimes it works if I wait awhile for the packets, but not always.
For example.  If I go "tcpdump -x -i eth0", it should do a dump of any
packets on the network, right?  If I do a ping to any machine at school it
doesn't work all the time.  It does work sometimes if I wait a really long
time.  What is going on, anyone have any clues?
p.s.
As far as I know, there is no way the IS guys can stop me from doing a dump
of packets to and from my machine!!!  Am I mistaken?
