Hi all,
I can not be able to use both my touchpad mouse and pointer mouse working using any 2.5.* kernel.
2.4.* works just fine.
2.5.40$ dmesg | grep MOUSE
register interface 'mouse' with class 'input
mice: PS/2 mouse device common for all mice
logibm.c: Didn't find Logitech busmouse at 0x23c
PS/2 mouse device should be my touchpad mouse.
Any hints ?
Ciao,
           Paolo
