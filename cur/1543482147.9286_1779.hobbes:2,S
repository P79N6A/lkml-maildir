I prefer:
  do
    ret = read (...);
  while (ret == -1 && errno == EINTR);
  if (ret == -1) {
    /* Handle real errors... */
  }
Using your style of assigning in a conditional, this would be very compact:
  while ((ret = read (...)) == -1 && errno == EINTR) ;
  if (ret == -1) {
    /* Handle real errors... */
  }
