To expand on this further: the way this probably *should* be handled,
Linux-style, is with internally-volatile versions of le32_to_cpup() and
friends.  That obeys the concept that the volatility should be
associated with an operation, not a data structure, and, being related
to an I/O device, should have its endianness explicitly declared.
Right now those macros don't exist, however.
