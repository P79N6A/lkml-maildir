That should cover all but the buggy tsc's - seperate patch anyway. Yep
sounds fine. I've also got the run time modified do_gettimeofday working
now.
It does the follwoing
do_gettimeofday() is the rdtsc code in full, inlining the asm core
do_slowgettimeoffset() is the slow one in full, inlining the asm core
During boot up if you have no tsc or if the tsc is know buggy the
following is executed
/*
 *	The extra jump has basically no measurable cost compared to all
 *	the I/O cycles we are about to do if its a slow timer
 */
static void have_no_tsc(void)
 	unsigned char *x=(unsigned char *)do_gettimeofday();
	u32 data=(u32)do_slow_gettimeofday;	/* Aim at */
	data-=(u32)do_gettimeofday;		/* We are here */
	data-=2;                                /* End relative */
	*x++=0xEB;                              /* JMP relative imm8 */
        *x++=(u8)data;                          /* imm8 */
