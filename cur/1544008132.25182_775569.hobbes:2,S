Hi All,
It's been a month since I reported a bug with my card reader
that stopped working after I upgraded to 2.6.27:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=11919
But I haven't noticed any activity since then.
Does it mean that it's not a bug and I'm doing something wrong?
Does anyone successfully use O2 SD card reader on 2.6.27?
Thanks,
Oleg
