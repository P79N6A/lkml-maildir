                tcp_port_rover = rover;
                spin_unlock(&tcp_portalloc_lock);
                /* Exhausted local port range during search? */

                if (remaining <= 0)
                        goto fail;
the goto can only hit when the lock hasn't been taken, so not unlocking it
is correct. It just rechecks the loop end condition, but your tool probably
doesn't know that. The wonders of structured programming :-)
