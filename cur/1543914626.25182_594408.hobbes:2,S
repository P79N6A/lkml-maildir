Kconfig let's you start with the defconfig when doing "make menuconfig" 
without any .config present, so in practice users start from the 
defconfig and then go through all menus at once enabling and disabling 
options to adapt the configurations to their needs.
Or they start from the "includes everything" .config of their 
distribution and remove everything they don't need.

Then the number of non-foolish users is quite near to 0...
If you expect people to read several hundreds or thousands of help texts 
only for configuring a kernel then you are expecting something that is 
simply not realistic.
It is intuitive for a user to enable the "Serial ATA" menu and he might 
not expect to have to read the help text when he has SATA drivers, while 
having to enable anything in the "SCSI device support" menu is highly 
unintuitively when the user does not have SCSI hardware.
