The kicker comes that B1 was developed based on A1, so any test
results were based on B1 being a single changeset delta away from A1. 
If the resulting 'BM' fails testing, and you've converted into the
linear model above where B2 has failed, you lose the ability to
isolate B1's changes and where they came from, to revalidate the
developer's results.
With bugs and fixes that can be validated in a few hours, this may not
be a problem, but when chasing a bug that takes days or weeks to
manifest, that a developer swears they fixed, one has to be able to
reproduce their exact test environment.
I believe that flattening the change graph makes history reproduction
impossible, or alternately, you are imposing on each developer to test
the merge results at B1 + A1..3 before submission, but in doing so,
the test time may require additional test periods etc and with
sufficient velocity, might never close.  This is the problem CVS has
if you don't create micro branches for every single modification.
