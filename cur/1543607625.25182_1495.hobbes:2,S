Perhaps you need to have no reference to CONFIG_ATALK in your config? 
At the very least, you should be able to go into Network Devices ->
Appletalk and see that if CONFIG_ATALK=n then the suboptions for the
devices are settable, and of course they should not be.  I don't know
why you don't see the errors on exit from make xconfig or the repeated
questions from oldconfig...
I also found another problem: there are two statements for CONFIG_ATALK,
the second one should be removed as the resulting options are in an if
block anyhow.  This results in double CONFIG_ATALK entries in your
config now that the gross if's were reorganized.  Updated patch
attached.
