Is any of this going anywhere?
There's a lot of resistance to fixing these things with
uninitialized_var() (usually bogus resistance, IMO, but one
gets tired of repeating oneself).
Many of these warnings can be fixed by restructuring the code, and
often the end result is better overall.
But it's a lot more work.  It would be much more scalable to, umm,
motivate the various code-owners to fix their stuff independently.  I
don't know how, really - people just don't seem to appreciate how
irritating and damaging that great warning spew is.
Is there any prospect that some of these things will be fixed by newer
gcc versions?  If so, we could just ignore those warnings and
concentrate on the ones which newer gcc emits.
