It's only used to store an ext2/3 block number (not a 512 byte sector
number, but a 1k, 2k, or 4k fs block number).  
Changing it to be sector_t wouldn't hurt, but it would be less
efficient if CONFIG_LBD were turned on, since ext2/3 would only store
32 bit values into it.  If someone needed it for the future, the
change could take place then.  It's a simple change: change the type
of e_block, in mbcache.h, and the type of "block" in the function
parameters of mb_cache_entry_insert and mb_cache_entry_get, and you're
done.  No change would be needed in the ext3 code.

Sure, that would be easy enough to do.  In the next patch....
