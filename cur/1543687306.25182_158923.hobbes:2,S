Not corner case at all. It's very typical with incrementally upgradeable
hardware (it would be very nice if commodity hardware were so, as it's
very wasteful to have to throw out preexisting hardware just to upgrade).
Conceptually what has to be done is very simple: pressure on cpus needs
to be weighted by cpu speed. The question is about specifics, not concepts.
I've even seen a system "in the field" (basically operating in a server
capacity as opposed to being a kernel hacking vehicle) with cpu speeds
ranging from 180MHz to 900MHz, with about 3 or 4 points in between.

Conceptually this is simple, too: take some tuning method based on cpu
speed and periodically (or possibly in an event-driven fashion) re-tune.
Again, this question's about the specifics, not the concept.
