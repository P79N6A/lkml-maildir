Hello,
Here's my wish for further kernels:
- the ability to easyly copy audio CD (maybe an extension of iso9660
to include audio ??? I have read some things about it...).
- for long, I haven't read the help in menuconfig for sg... I am now
in configuring 2.2.9-ac6, and I was surprise to discover it was
talking about cdwrite, but not cdrecord neither cdrdao, why???
- PIII optimisation in the kernels
- the possibilty to configure atyfb in xconfig (works in some revisons...).
- the inclusion of alsa (I know, it isn't yet finished, but experimantal
kernels aren't for that?).
- an atyfb that would work with ATI Xpert@Play 8 Mb AGP (the only kernels
from all those I have tried who worked was 2.2.7-ac1).
- I have read somewhere that the US where changing their position (but I
could be wrong informed...) so RSA could directly be implemented.
I know I am dreaming, but only linux makes it possible!!!
Thanks for reading!
Please, don't cc to me: I am on the list...
