Would I be correct in assuming that you're using a serial
console, and that the oops was caused by the NMI watchdog?
It seems that this is _bound_ to happen - we're busy
waiting on the UART with interrupts disabled....
Some fixes which come to mind are:
1: the serial console code tells the NMI oopser that it knows what
   it's doing.
2: the serial console code aborts the write if it doesn't make any
   progress for 1/10th of a second.
3: Boot the kernel with the `nmi_watchdog=0' LILO option if you're
   using an unreliable serial console.
