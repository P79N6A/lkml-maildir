Hi,
I want to report that suspend to RAM stopped working on my Sony Vaio 
VGN-FZ240E in 2.6.25-rc1 and that I could bisect the problem down
to:
commit bc71bec91f9875ef825d12104acf3bf4ca215fa4
Author: venkatesh.pallipadi@intel.com <venkatesh.pallipadi@intel.com>

    ACPI: enable MWAIT for C1 idle
    Add MWAIT idle for C1 state instead of halt, on platforms that support
    C1 state with MWAIT.
    Renames cx->space_id to something more appropriate.

The problem with suspend to RAM is that right after typing (from inside X)
'echo mem > /sys/power/state' the screen becomes black and the laptop 
freezes. I have to use SysRq+b to reboot.
I tried to revert the above commit (bc71bec) on top of 2.6.25-rc1, but
the compilation fails. It turns out that I have to revert also 9a0b8415 and
9b12e18c to be able to compile without errors. 
After reverting the 3 commits mentioned above, the resulting 2.6.25-rc1 kernel
can suspend to RAM again (and I must say that it is better that 2.6.24, because
now it resumes directly into X and I don't need to use Crtl-Alt-F1 and Alt-F7 to
go back to X as I used to do before).
The laptop is a Core 2 Duo T7250 2.0 GHz, running Mandriva 2008.0 in 64-bit mode, with the
following graphics card:
VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 0c) (prog-if 00 [VGA])
If there is anything else I can do to help please let me know.
