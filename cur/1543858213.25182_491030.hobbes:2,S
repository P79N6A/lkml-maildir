OK, should be easy enough to fix :)

Sorry about that, I'm currently working from a remote location so I have
to rely on a webmail to post, and that webmail doesn't give me as much
control as I'd like on formatting. I tried to shorten the long bars and
hoped it wouldn't wrap, but it seems it did still. This should not
happen otherwise (when I'm at home.) In the meantime, I will instruct
diffstat to produce a 72-column output so that no wrapping can occur.
