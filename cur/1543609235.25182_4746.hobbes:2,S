Not as far as the compiler is concerned! You don't want the compiler
to generate code that reads 'current' once upon startup, and never
again. Further, you don't want that pointer to exist in .rodata, you
want it with the changable variables in .data or .bss .

    I was going to compile a list of innovations that could be
    attributed to Microsoft. Once I realized that Ctrl-Alt-Del
    was handled in the BIOS, I found that there aren't any.
