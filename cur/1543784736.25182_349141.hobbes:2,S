Important to whom?  Kernel developers or userspace developers?  If the
latter, what use do they actually make of it?  Shouldn't it be documented?

If it's useful to application developers then fine.  It it's only useful to
kernel developers then the argument is weakened.  However there's still
quite a lot of development going on in this area, so there's still some
argument for having the monitoring ability in the mainline tree.
