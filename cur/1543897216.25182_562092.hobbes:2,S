Hi Paul,
Limiting memory footprint (RSS and pagecache) for multi media
applications would work.  However, generally streaming applications
have a fairly constant RSS size (mapped pagecache pages + ANON) while
the unmapped pagecache pages is what we want to control better.
If we have a combined limit for unmapped pagecache pages and RSS, then
 we will have to bring in vm_swappiness kind of knobs for each
container to influence the per container reclaim process so as to not
hurt the application performance badly.
RSS controller should be able to take care of the mapped memory
footprint if needed.  In case of database server, moving out any of it
RSS pages will hurt it performance, while we are free to shrink the
unmapped pagecache pages to any smaller limit since the database is
using direct IO and does not benefit from pagecache.
With pagecache controller, we are able to split application's memory
pages into mapped and unmapped pages. Ability to account and control
unmapped pages in memory provides more possibilities for fine grain
resource management.
