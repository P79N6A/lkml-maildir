No.
I still need to take the time and read this thread and find the real
problem here.  The fact that the issue does not show up for other,
non-scsi block devices, makes me feel this is a scsi-specific problem
with how it deals with the driver model, but I need to take the time to
sit down and figure it out for sure.

I'll take a combined patch, as I don't think I got a signed-off for your
version, I was waiting for a "final" version.
Back to the kobject/kset cleanup/debug mess :)
