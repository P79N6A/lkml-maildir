You do have shared memory or else your shared libraries would not
work. The problem is that somebody decided that the CPU cost to
calculate the amount used was "too great", so it's not being shown.
Hopefully this will be resolved at a later date and we will again
be able to see shared memory activity.

course you get it all back when you reboot..."; Actual explanation
