Hi Greg,
I was hoping that the fixes for bug 7785 "BUG: at fs/inotify.c:172 set_dentry_child_flags()" could be added to the stable releases. I'm seeing these quite frequently at customer installations.
The relevant commits are d599e36a9ea85432587f4550acc113cd7549d12a and 0d71bd5993b630a989d15adc2562a9ffe41cd26d. Hopefully these do not depend on other updates. Nick would be the expert on that.
Rgds
