Oh yes it is. The 2.6.8-rc2-mm2 report definitely was a BUG().
Earlier ones may not have been, but on the other hand, earlier ones may
not have had the BUG()-check for corrupted list_del() usage - it's not in
the standard kernel, and I don't know when it was added to -mm. (We used
to have it a _long_ time ago, but then we removed it because there were no
reports of problems).

.. and that must be because of some kind of pointer corruption, where the 
dentry was either free'd twice or the dentry simply isn't a dentry at all, 
it just got to be used as such because of some bug.

I've followed the discussion. You may not have noticed that the last one 
was different. (And I _think_ it may hav ebeen the first time Gene did a 
-mm kernel, so I do believe that the list_del() debugging was the thing 
that caught it).
Anyway, one other thing that makes me worry is the fact that Gene 
apparently has a K7. One of the things AMD has gotten wrong several times 
is prefetching, and it so happens that the dcache code is one of the users 
of the prefetch instruction. prude_dcache() in particular.
So I'm also entertaining the notion that there's an actual prefetch data 
corruption, not just the known AMD bug with occasional spurious page 
faults. Who else has seen the problem? What CPU's are involved?
