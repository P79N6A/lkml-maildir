And that is exactly _the_ argument in this whole discussion. There seem to be
people out there who want to make a living from _others_ _ancient_ work they
bought for small bucks by sueing just about anyone.
GPL has an inherent long-term strategy, you are talking of short-term, Larry.
That does not match. If I am using only GPL-software I know I am able to use it
as is in five years from now. If I depend on being nice to commercial
companies, it may well turn out, that they are not being nice to me no matter
what I do.
In other words: it's all about being free or being dependant on goodwill.
Greets to the land of the free and the home of the brave,
Stephan
