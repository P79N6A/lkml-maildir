>   Netfilter option enabled (NAT modules 0.1.12 installed), port forwarding
I've seen numerous silent hangs when trying to use netfilter;
the machine just stops, hard, no sysrq, etc.  no identifiable cause,
no correlation with activity.  once I was in X, then *ping* goes the monitor
and I'm watching the bios count ram.  this hardware is solid 
in the absence of netfilter.
that was for various kernels and netfilter-0.1.9/10/11/12.  right now,
I'm running netfilter 0.1.13 and kernel 2.3.34, and it seems to be 
working nicely.  I would suggest updating and trying again.
BTW, does anyone know when netfilter will be integrated into the kernel?
I find modules, especially separately distributed ones, a PITA.
regards, mark hahn.
