Hello,
Does resuming from swsuspend work for anyone with amd64-agp loaded?
On my system when I suspend with amd64-agp loaded, I get a spontaneous 
reboot on resume. It reboots immediately after reading the saved image 
from disk.
This is 100% reproducible.
Athlon 64 FX-53, Asus A8V Deluxe, Linux 2.6.13-rc3-mm1.
Regards,
Michal
