so you are saying that you know better then we do what we need?
some people configure ACPI only becouse their system won't work properly 
without it. they have no intention of ever doing a STR or hibernate.

so have something like
config ACPI_SLEEP
         select HOTPLUG_CPU if X86 && SMP
         select SUSPEND_SMP if X86 && SMP
instead of makeing it dependant on ACPI.
