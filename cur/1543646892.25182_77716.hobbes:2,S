Hi,
I have had some total crashes on my box without any output to console. The 
kernel just started to blink CapsLock and ScrollLock LEDs.
I wasn't able to find any documentation to these error-codes.
I'm using 2.4.19 on an i386 architecture:
CPU: K5PR166
Chipset: PIIX3
I will post more information, if needed.
I just found out that I use the wrong gcc-version 2.95.2 instead of 2.95.3, so 
the error will perhaps go away after recompilation.
But I'm still curious about these errorcodes.
Thanks in advance
 Jan-Hinnerk
