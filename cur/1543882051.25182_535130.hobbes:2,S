What I am coupling? The approach solves a series of issues as far as I can 
tell.

We have that ability (although in a limited form) right now.

That is a statement of faith in small requests? Small requests are 
fundamental so we want them?

This aint gonna work without something that stores the information about 
how the pieces come together. Teach the code.... More hacks.

There are such designs? You can limit fragmentation but not avoid it.

We have fragmentation because we cannot limit our allocation sizes to 4k. 
The stack is already 8k and there are subsystems that need more (f.e. 
for jumbo frames). Then there is the huge page subsystem that is used to 
avoid the TLB pressure that comes with small pages.
I think we are doing our typical community thing of running away from the 
problem and developing ways to explain why our traditional approaches are 
right.
