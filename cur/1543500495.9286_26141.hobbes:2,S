Subject: kernel programming isn't so hard, but even so, reiserfs seems to be getting an "exokernel" implementation (was albods are not a clean set of orthogonal primitives)

Loic@ceic.com is taking our debugging tool (emu.c) which implements
reiserfs in user space, and is making it more effective for real usage
of reiserfs in user space.  Right now he is working on the buffer.c
stuff, which is most of the difference between a real implementation and
a debugging implementation..  So actually, reiserfs seems to be going
into a dual exo-kernel endo-kernel implementation, in which you choose
which you want to use, and either one will be effective..  I had no part
in this decision....  I'm not sure it is worth doing.... he is going to
have to get the user daemon to effective share memory for its buffer
cache with the kernel, and he is going to have to switch from using
write() to using mmap().  I think that means he has to use mmap() on the
raw device.
The emu.c stuff got written because there was no gdb kernel debugger
working for Linux at the time it was written.  Having done it we find it
is easier to debug outside the kernel, even with a gdb kernel debugger,
due to reboot time.  It is a user-daemon-kernel interaction, no return
to user space.
I guess the daemon makes it really not an exokernel.  If it was really
an exokernel, it would be the user libraries that do everything, am I
right?  In exo-kernels, why the user-kernel-user mode transition?  I
thought the whole thing was that they wanted to avoid that?  Is security
the reason?  I don't think loic@ceic.com is worrying about security, he
doesn't need it for his web crawler.  He does need to be able to batch a
lot of system calls together, and debugging that in user space may be
easier.
I have mixed feelings about it.

It's called porting the filesystem.  It is as feasible as porting a
library when you have access to kernel source.

Kernel programming isn't so hard....

We'll try to write modular code.... even to make it a kernel module...:-)
