what high/low semantics do you mean, other than the ordering of softirq
sources? (which is currently implemented via the __do_softirq() loop
first looking at the highest prio softirq.) So splitting up ksoftirqd
into two pieces seems like a separate issue.

local_bh_disable() excludes all softirq processing. This means that such
a section must not be preempted. E.g. the networking layer manipulates
per-CPU lists from such sections, if you remove local_bh_disable() then
from the middle of such a section we could preempt into ksoftirqd which
would break the code.

yes, that's how softirqs are used. The patch changes these semantics.

ok - sorry about the misattribution!
