Hi,
I am trying to build the toolchain for MIPS processor using buildroot.
I am using gcc version of 3.4.3, binutils-2.15, uclibc-0.9.28 and linux-2.6.18.8 kernel.
Basically i need to enable NPTL feature support in my toolchain.
does uclibc-0.9.28 has the support for NPTL?
If not, how can i get it enabled for my above build configuration?
I see there is separate branch "uclibc-nptl" in uclibc. 
Do i need to use this (uclibc-nptl) to meet my requirement?
Could you please suggest me right approach to succssfully enable NPTL?
Thanks in advance.
Regards,
Veerasena.
