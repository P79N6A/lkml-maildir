Hi all, hi Linus,
I've got patches to the Linux kernel that introduce a new architecture.
What do I do to get them merged into the main development tree ?
Here's the deal:
The patches are for the IBM ESA/390 mainframe family; I've mentioned this
on this list in the past.  (There's a modest mailing list elsewhere that
discusses this work but traffic is light; few people have access to a 
mainframe). 
The current patches are located at 
http://linas.org/linux/i370/
Although they are against linux-2.2.1 they should in fact apply more 
or less cleanly against any build, as 99% of the patch just creates
new directories arch/i370 and include/asm-i370.  If you really want patches
against 2.3.x, I suppose I can do that, but for all practical purposes
this is a 'generic' patch that should apply anywhere.
The i370 ('instruction 370') name is anachronistic, but in 
keeping with the gnu tools naming convention for this arch.
Status: 'pre-alpha' would be a good description.  In fact, the kernel 
boots to the point of mounting a ramdisk, and trying to load & exec an
ELF binary.  Impressive, I suppose but quite misleading:  user-level
virtual memory is broken, system calls still have glitches, bottom-half
handlers not invoked, io subsystem all but missing (there is console out, 
but that's all), no support for hardware disk drives or network devices, 
etc.  But I figure since its been 5 months since this project was started, 
its maybe time to feed the patches into the mainstream, even if the system
is still unusable.
Let me know how to proceed ...

P.S. no I'm not a fan of linux because it sounds like my name, and no,
I don't carry a blanket.
