Maybe. Its just there are two ways to deal with the smart situation
1.	You do it per request
2.	You keep a "wishlist mtrr" set and you attempt to fulfill it as best
	you can. This also means that if an mtrr is deleted you just
	run mtrr_recalc() and it may reassigned mtrrs to drivers that it
	couldnt fit in before
Im not convinced tht the smart per request handling is any easier than resolving
the generic "here is the wanted mtrr list" case.
