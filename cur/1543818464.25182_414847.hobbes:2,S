Yes, the driver isn't portable. I'm working on the blackfin linux
system. The driver is written mostly by c except one codec. You know,
blackfin has DSP instruction set, so I write the codec in assembly to
improve my driver's performance.

Makefile is simple.

obj-$(CONFIG_FB_BFIN_7171)	  += bfin_ad7171fb.o rgb2ycbcr.o

===============================
There are two files, bfin_ad7171fb.c and rgb2ycbcr.S under the folder
" ./drivers/video".
It should be OK because the driver can pass the compilation when
select it as built-in.
It just failed when select it as module.
Thanks your any hints.
