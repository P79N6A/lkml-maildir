I hope this isn't a duplicate, but I haven't seen these issues raised 
yet on the list.
I wasn't able to choose processor types in menuconfig without the patch 
appended below.  xconfig seemed happy with the parentheses.  I wasn't 
sure how to properly escape parens (if possible) so please consider this 
my own speculative hack.
Also, I don't seem to be able to backspace in numeric fields in 
menuconfig when using xterm emulation and a terminal app that sends ^H 
(and yes, "stty erase ^H").  I don't think this started with 2.4.5-pre1, 
but before I assumed it was my terminal flaking out.  Switching to 
$term=="vt100" or switching to DEL instead of ^H in the terminal app 
fixes the problem.  It's easy to reproduce by running Gnome terminal on 
a default RH6.2 system.
Thanks much, please contact me if you have any Qs.
