Hi
i have the following on motherboard card.
 Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8233 AC97 Audio
Controller (rev 48).
there appears ot be a driver for it. But i am havign a few problems with it
when the driver loads it says it picks the card up no problem
and stays loaded and has the ioports, irq in /proc/*
but when trying to open /dev/audio or /dev/dsp or /dev/mixer
all i get back is a -ENODEV
does anyone know where i could get the docs on the card and have
ago at fixing the driver ? is there a maintiner / active people
working on the driver ?
i currently also have the via drivers working on it but they
tend to work / not work and work a bit of the time and of course
these taint my kernel :(
thanks
    James
