Yeah, that's fair enough I suppose. I wasn't thinking you'd have a
huge newly dirtied file, but it could happen. I don't want to cause
regressions.

Ah, yes I see I missed that. I like that a lot better.

Sure, I think there is still a data race though, but if there is one
it's already been there for a long time and nobody cares too much about
those anyway.

In existing code:
mark_buffer_dirty_inode():              fsync_buffers_list():
 test_set_buffer_dirty(bh);              list_del_init(&bh->b_assoc_buffers);
 if (list_empty(&bh->b_assoc_buffers))   if (buffer_dirty(bh)) {
     ...                                   list_add(&bh->b_assoc_buffers, );
These two code sequences can run concurrently because only fsync_buffers_list
takes the lock.
So fsync_buffers_list can speculatively load bh->b_state before
its stores to clear b_assoc_buffers propagate to the CPU running
mark_buffer_dirty_inode.
So if there is a !dirty buffer on the list, then fsync_buffers_list will
remove it from the list, but mark_buffer_dirty_inode won't see it has been
removed from the list and won't re-add it. I think.
This is actually even possible to hit on x86 because they reorder loads
past stores. It needs a smp_mb() before if (buffer_dirty(bh) {}.
Actually I very much dislike testing list entries locklessly, because they
are not trivially atomic operations like single stores... which is another
reason why I like your first patch.
