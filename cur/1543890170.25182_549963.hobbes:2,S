The device-mapper position has always been that we require

(i.e. containing no data to read or write - or emulated, possibly
device-specific)
before we can provide full barrier support.
  (Consider multiple active paths - each must see barrier.)
Until every device supports barriers -EOPNOTSUP support is required.
  (Consider reconfiguration of stacks of devices - barrier support is a
   dynamic block device property that can switch between available and
   unavailable at any time.)
