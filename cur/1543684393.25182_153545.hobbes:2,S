Hi all.
I've done some work on updating the kdb patch for 2.5.73 to work under
test-1, and have uploaded the results so far to
http://wwww.sourceforge.net/projects/swsusp.
 I had to do a bit of work
on the keyboard handling to get it usable on my laptop, but haven't
spent any time checking the functionality proper. Nevertheless, it will
hopefully be useful or at least a basis for further work.
Regards,
Nigel
