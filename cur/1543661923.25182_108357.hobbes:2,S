Sounds like the easiest way to get that fair, indeed.  Manage
every disk as a separately scheduled resource...

Considering that one medium/far disk seek counts for about 400 kB
of data read/write, I suspect we'll just want to merge requests or
put adjacant requests next to each other into the elevator up to
a fairly large size. Probably about 1 MB for a hard disk or a cdrom,
but much less for floppies, opticals, etc...

That is the anticipatory scheduler.  A good complement to the SFQ
part of the IO scheduler.  I'd really like to see both ideas together
in one scheduler, they sound like a winning pair.

The anticipatory scheduler can just remain "on" while the priority
difference of the requests of the current process aren't too big
when compared to the priority of the other requests.  Once the SFQ
part of the scheduler sends down requests with a really big priority
difference the anticipatory scheduler can "skip a beat" and switch
to another process.
Note that Andrea's distinction between synchronous and asynchronous
requests may be more appropriate than the distinction between read
and write requests ...
The only remaining question is how do we know which requests are
synchronous and which are asynchronous ?   Ie. which requests have
a process waiting on their completion and which requests don't have
a process waiting on their completion ?

Rik
