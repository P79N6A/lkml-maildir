Hello there,
I just tried to compile Linux kernel 2.6.18.3 with the Intel C
C compiler.
The compiler said
kernel/hrtimer.c(511): remark #593: variable "base" was set but never used
The source code is
    struct hrtimer_base *base;
I have checked the source code and I agree with the compiler.
Suggest delete local variable.
Regards
David Binderman
