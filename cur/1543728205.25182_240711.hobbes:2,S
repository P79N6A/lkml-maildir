Suspending a partial tree is part of the "device power management"
problem ... it's not a policy, and deferring it would punt on one of
the more basic problems.
A policy would be IMO more like "how far should I suspend this",
"can this device wake out of its suspend state", or more interestingly
"how should these devices interact".
So:  "suspend everything using the 48 MHz clock, so we can
enter a deeper system sleep state" would be a kind of policy.
At least so long as those clock relationships don't appear
explicitly in the driver model ... they could be recorded in
device-specific power state descriptors.
