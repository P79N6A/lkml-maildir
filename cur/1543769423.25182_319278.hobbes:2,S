It's implicit, when the last task calls put_namespace:
	void __put_namespace(struct namespace *namespace)
	{
[...]
		umount_tree(namespace->root);
		-> calls detach_mnt for each vfsmnt in namespace.
[...]
	}

Unreachable as in no file descriptors (or chroot/cwd) refer to the
vfsmnt, either directly or indirectly through a path traversal.

There aren't any vfsmnt->vfsmnt cycles...  They're a forest, vfsmnts
don't move from one tree to another (bind mounts don't link them, they
create new vfsmnts), and each tree can be referenced by a file
descriptor at any point on the tree.
It rather hinges on which of these behaviours you prefer:
   1. A file descriptor/chroot/cwd reference to any point in a vfsmnt
      tree means the whole tree is retained.  This means ".." remains
      always accessible: fchdir(fd); open("..") continues to access
      that whole tree as you still have fd.
   2. A file descriptor/chroot/cwd reference to any point in a vfsmnt
      tree means the subtree from that point is retained, and parents
      may disappear if there are no references (not counting ".." as a
      reference).  This behaviour is more sensible for chroots, where
      the parents should be inaccessible anyway.
   3. A mixture, where current->root references only maintain the
      subtree rooted at that point, and other references, if outside
      the current->root subtree, retain the whole tree accessible from
      those references.
The appropriate data structure / algorithm depends on which behaviour
is preferred.  So which is it?  1 Is best done with a mnt_namespace
structure, but references to it counted when vfsmnts are referenced by
file descriptors/root/cwd, _not_ references by tasks (no
current->namespace).  2 is best done by simply reference counting
vfsmnts.
