Sorry, I wasn't clear... I read *that* answer, but it says "as mentioned in 
the discussion about ROOT_DEV", and I couldn't find it.
Also, I'd like to know whether there's a correct way to implement this (using 
something different than root_dev, for instance the init[1] root directory 
mount device). I understand that with the possibility for multiple mounts the 
"root device" is more difficult to know (and maybe this is the reason for 
which ROOT_DEV is bogus, is this?), but at least a check on the param 
"rootfstype=hostfs" could be done.

Hmm, you don't seem very talkative, sorry. You can explain why doing that 
hurts anyhow. You only said very vaguely "there is another way to do 
this" (still to prove). And actually this caused the merge, in place of that 
clean patch, of the current hack, described above in the quoted text.

Ok, this is nice. I'll repost the (updated) patch CC'ing Ingo Molnar (unless 
there's another Ingo).
