Still can't understand... OK, I think we misundersood each other.
Do you agree that the code is technically correct? Or I missed
something?
"continue" looks fine to me too, it is also for the inner loop.

Yes, I see it is not reachable, but I don't understand why this
deserves a warning ;)
Look, "if (PIDTYPE_PGID == PIDTYPE_PID)" is not possible too, should
the compiler (or whatever) complain?
