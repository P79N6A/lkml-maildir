thanks. This has been bisected before by Alexey Zaytsev so i've now 
reverted the commit in tip/sched/urgent and will send it to Linus ASAP. 
The revert commit can be found below.

Subject: [PATCH] Revert "sched: improve preempt debugging"
This reverts commit 7317d7b87edb41a9135e30be1ec3f7ef817c53dd.
This has been reported (and bisected) by Alexey Zaytsev and
Kamalesh Babulal to produce annoying warnings during bootup
on both x86 and powerpc.
kernel_locked() is not a valid test in IRQ context (we update the
BKL's ->lock_depth and the preempt count separately and non-atomicalyy),
so we cannot put it into the generic preempt debugging checks which
can run in IRQ contexts too.
