With 2.6.14 or with current mainline ?
I doubt that this can happen, as itimer_delete() is only called, when
there are no more references to the shared sig struct. At this point no
other related thread can run sys_timer_delete(). 
If this happens, then something else is completely broken.

I do not buy that either. In sys_timer_delete() the active timer is
canceled. If we can not cancel it then we retry until the timer callback
has been processed. This is even true for 2.6.14 (pre hrtimer).

This is wrong. You look at something which is not valid anymore, if your
theory is correct. You are just pampering over the real bug.

Same here.
Can you reproduce the problem against mainline + my patch applied ?
