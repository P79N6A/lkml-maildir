A file is a stream of bytes (usually of a known size).
A message can be part of a stream of bytes, a status
report, or something different.
A file is actively read() from, a message can be delivered
very much like a signal. This makes asynchronous I/O more
easy than the file paradigm where async I/O is aided by signals
and other additional cruft.
If the OS only has to tuck a status word onto the message
(or in case of large reads, send a message with a pointer
to a page which has just been mapped into the process'
address space) we again have a consistent interface for
all things in the system.
No longer a difference between files, pipes, network
connections, connectionless network communication and
signals.
One interface to rule them all
One interface to find them
One interface to bind them all
And out of the kernel unwind them :)
