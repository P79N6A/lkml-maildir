No need--- it's userspace-solvable; we just need a rule that says
"fork() in a thread is actually a clone(...|CLONE_PARENT,...)"
and the magic happens all by itself.

Exactly. Userspace is the key. (We just probably need a 'parent has
exec()ed' notification signal in the children, like the current 'parent has
exit()ed' one).
