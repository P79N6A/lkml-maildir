I think this needs a bit of a plain-text explanation, sans acronyms.
Perhaps a real-world example with files like /etc/passwd or /bin/sh
would help me understand it better.	
I'm still trying to wrap my head around the whole "invalidate something
when there are both readers and writers around" situation.  How does
that fit into the description above?  Does that tie into the guarantee
that "IMA measures all files before they are accessed in any way"?
