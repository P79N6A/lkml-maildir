Actually, my next request would be for architectures to actually inline 
the fast path if they see benefit.  On ARM, given the tight fast path 
allowed by mutexes, it is indeed beneficial to inline them (the last 
patch of my latest serie does just that).  So weak symbols are not 
really useful in that case.
