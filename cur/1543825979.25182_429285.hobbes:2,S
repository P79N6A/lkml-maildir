I just checked the Xorg R7 drivers. The ones I checked are statically
linked to their X components so there are no big X dependencies. That
makes them usable as standalone drivers.
What do you think about wrapping them with EGL instead of using their
entry points directly? That would remove the temptation to use
acceleration code in the X drivers and encourage use of DRM instead.
Wrapping them with EGL was my plan for getting Xegl up last summer
when Nvidia wouldn't implement the API. Using the X driver was the
only solution available for Nvidia/ATI hardware.
This still needs to be classified as a temporary solution. Long term
the code needs to be extracted from X and converted to a standalone
build system. They could be turned in to real EGL drivers at that
point.
