Well the problem is that rlogin and rsh call the library function
rcmd(). That function _has_ to be called with euid == 0.
The above change in 2.2.7 simply broke GNU libc. All versions ..
For apparently no reason (AFAICS, IMHO etc)

I don't understand, whatever you run under su runs with
uid == suid == euid == fsuid, right ?
Anyway, a Linux-specific fix in rlogin and rsh is possible by doing
	setfsuid(getuid());
	.. rcmd() ..
	setfsuid(geteuid());
That will work under all kernels, and will not break stuff
when the rcmd() function in glibc is fixed (or the kernel.....)
So Herbert, please fix rlogin and rsh :]
Mike.
