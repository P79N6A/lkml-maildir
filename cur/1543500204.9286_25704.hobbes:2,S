I've now been through most of the 2.2.7->2.2.9 diff set discarding stuff
that seems not to be a viable candiate.
The remaining suspects are:
	o	Quota - which has big 2.2.7->2.2.9 changes.
	o	The small scsi changes (dubious)
	o	A small mm change
There are other candiates - notably
	TCP changes
	interrupt changes
	IRDA
	NFS
The tcp changes ought to have shown up more than this does. The interrupt
changes dont really seem to explain cross platform stuff. And I doubt most
people running these tests were running irda. NFS is a possibility.
So - are most people seeing the problems running quotas ? And would someone
with their brain firmly wrapped around the page cache/vfs verify this change
that was made is absolutely safe
