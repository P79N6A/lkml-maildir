Thats a concious decision.

Take a look at the HFS file system. We present the MAC directories as a
directory containing dot files. There is a convention for this and we honour
the convention that is used by Netatalk (the main Unix/Linux appletalk server
package). Thus you see 
	foo.gif
	.AppleDouble/foo.gif
This also means you can easily manipulate just the gif file directly from
non mac systems. See fs/hfs/HFS.txt
The second issue is charset translation. I think you can simply use the
code from fs/hfs/trans.c for this.
