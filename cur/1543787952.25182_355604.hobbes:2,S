make oldconfig, menuconfig, gconfig work fine with me
(_but_ using a 2.6.13.2 .config -- so the jump is
smaller...)
make xconfig gives me troubles 2 (static parser...)
another way to go would be to explicitly save your old
(2.6.4) .config into something like .config-randy...
then consume it... (xconfig will not find a .config /
implicitly work, then you fool it by loading
.config-randy) that _should_ do it... if still not
working, mrproper the old 6.4 then goto
.config-randy... my $.02
