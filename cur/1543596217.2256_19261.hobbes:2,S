Ive also had a problem with signal 11, heres a great page explaining the aspects of signal 11 error from gcc (
http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/
).
Signal 11 is usually a hardware problem, as the article points out. I found a sloppy soulution playing with my BIOS settings, turns out there was an option called "Memory Hole at 15Mb Addr." I enabled it and i got no more sig11, however when I boot up, Linux only recognizes like 13Mb of my 64Mb of RAM. 
Anyway, there are my 2 cents.
