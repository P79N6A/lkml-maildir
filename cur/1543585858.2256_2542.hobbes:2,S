Would it be possible for you to re-run your tests against kernel
2.4.3-pre8?  (
ftp://ftp.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/testing/
)
This is the "official" latest version of the via-rhine driver, and it
includes Manfred's patch, as well as a pci_enable_device movement might
solve your problem.
If the problem is still not solved, could you download via-diag.c and
libmii.c from 
ftp://www.scyld.com/pub/diag/
   Compile instructions are
at the bottom of via-diag.c.  I'm interested in seeing two via-diag
register snapshots, one from a cold boot (where it is working), and one
from a warm boot.
  ./via-diag -maaavvveef > via-diag-cold.txt
	and
  ./via-diag -maaavvveef > via-diag-warm.txt
	then
   diff -u v*cold.txt v*warm.txt | send mail...
And to see if the PCI configuration registers change between warm boot
and cold boot, run lspci from pciutils:
  lspci -vvvxxx > lspci-cold.txt
	and
  lspci -vvvxxx > lspci-warm.txt
	then
  diff -u l*cold.txt l*warm.txt | send mail...
