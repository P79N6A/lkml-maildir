Greetings,
I've recently upgraded udev from 063 to 082 and then 084.
With 063, startup of udev was near-instant; with both 082 and 084, it 
takes a significant ammount of time (~15s) to create the base devices 
using udevstart or udevsynthesize (this one is taken from Debian, which 
apparently in turn taken it from SuSE; the rest of codebase is vanilla).
This issue appears on kernel 2.6.15.1 with SquashFS 2.2r2, SWSUP2 2.2 
and VesaFB-TNG 1.0-rc1-r3 patches.
The init script used simply mounts 10MiB tmpfs onto /dev, creates 
/dev/.udev/{db,queue} directories, then runs udevd --daemon and then 
udevsynthesize or udevstart (tried both, same result).
I'm quite out of ideas, I don't think downgrading udev is the best 
solution, so I wonder: what takes such a long time in udevstart? What 
can I alter at my end, or is this a known bug (or feature)?
Thanks in advance for reply
