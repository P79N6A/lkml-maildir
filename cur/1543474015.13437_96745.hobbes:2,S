	I don't know if this is expected behavior .. but it didn't seem
	right to me so here goes.
	I ran across an interresting concept in a BIND FAQ that
	discussed having two bind servers running on one machine and
	servering requests based on IP for ussage on networks behind
	a firewall or in resolving IP's on a network that wheren't ment
	for say the outside world.
	The section of the FAQ concerning this can be located at:
	
http://www.intac.com/~cdp/cptd-faq/section5.html#split_DNS
	To quote the FAQ:
	"A corporation may impose the following policy: if someone asked
	 for the IP address of WWW.DOMAIN.COM, they may want to:
       * Answer that the IP address is 172.16.2.3, if the request came from
         one of the following IP networks: 172.1/16, 172.2/16 or 172.10/16.
       * Answer that the IP address is 172.16.1.1, if the request came from
         the IP address 172.16/16 or 172.17.128/18.
       * By default, for all other requests send the answer that the IP
         address is 172.16.2.3."
	The utilities recommended for the process where either udprelay
	or NAT.
	I saw no obvious reasons why the linux transparent proxy and ip couldn't
	handle this aspect.  The end theory is that each named sits on it's
	own port on the same server and a set of rules based on source
	address decide which port the request will be directed at.
	In hopes of utilizing this configuration for my network in order
	to keep a single unified nameserver that handles requests for all
	hosts I ran across the following "features" that appeared fairly odd.
	Initially I had configured one named to listen-on port 53 as default.
	This named would answer all public requests.  Anything comming
	from outside the local network.  
	The second named was bound to port 54 for answering all requests
	for the internal network.
	The initial ipchains rule I settup to handle this request was as 
	follows:
	ipchains -A input -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 192.168.1.42 53 \
           	-j REDIRECT 54
	ipchains -A input -p udp -s 192.168.1.0/24 -d 192.168.1.42 53 \
           	-j REDIRECT 54
	This I assumed would redirect any requests from the local network
	to port 54 to be handled by the second named.  This failed misserably.
	It turns out that the redirection does not function if the initial
	destination port ( port 53 ) is bound to. 
	( so far only true for named for unknown reasons )
	Not to be one to be discouraged overly about this I settup the first
	named on port 55 and modified my rules some.
	In particular I applied a another rule that simply stated
        ipchains -A input -p tcp -s ! 192.168.1.0/24 -d 192.168.1.42 53 \
                -j REDIRECT 55
        ipchains -A input -p udp -s ! 192.168.1.0/24 -d 192.168.1.42 53 \
                -j REDIRECT 55
	Feeling odd at this time that I would be using 3 ports to do the job
	of 2 I went ahead and attempted to use this configuration.
	nslookup of hosts via the local network worked flawlessly.  As did
	any and all nslookups of hosts from a machine outside the network, 
	at this time I was like yeh .. it works .. all is well.
	Problems came when I tried to ping/telnet ..ect.. ( use anything 
	other then nslookup ).  The request would hang and I would get back
	something to the aspect of "host not found" after a timeout period.
	I have not yet ripped apart a whole lot to figure out what is going
	on, but with logging rules turned on I do get reports that the
	requests are comming in and beeing redirected.  But for some reason
	the applications are having a bad hair day handling it.
	Since then I have reverted back to just returning public only data
	for all requestes regardless of host and setting up an /etc/hosts
	file for all machines inside the private network.
	A note:  this does not appear to be true for inetd.  I can settup
	an entry in the inetd to run a script for port connections and
	the redirection appearrs to work flawlessly regardless if inetd
	is handling requests to a port already or not.  This only appears
	to be a conflict of interests in named at the moment that I can tell.
