No, you don't read this right.  We have a fix for a correctness issue
that has almost 0% chance of ever triggering in real life, has exactly 0
bug reports of it ever happening, and which has been integrated into our
tree.  Obviously, we always push new kernels to all of our customers
every time we have this situation, or about twice a day...

Puh-Leeze.  If you actually read the source code, you would see just how
damn near impossible this bug is.  But, since you obviously didn't, let
me enlighten you:
1)  The offending code is part of the error handler code, specifically
the section that kicks drives back into gear after recovery is complete.
2)  The only section of code it's racing against is scsi_request_fn.
3)  The race only happens if scsi_request_fn() detects that
host->in_recovery is not set.
So, a sample would be something like this
CPU1
spin_lock_irqsave(device_lock)
scsi_request_fn()
  check host->in_recovery == 0
  [ start window ]
  make a couple other sanity checks
  [ end window ]
  spin_lock(host_lock)
  modify host command counts
  spin_unlock(host_lock)
  finish prepping command
  spin_unlock(device_lock)
  scsi_dispatch_cmd()
  spin_lock(device_lock)
  return
spin_unlock(device_lock)
Now, in that little, itty, bitty window in scsi_request_fn(), we have to
A) get some kind of error that starts the error handler subsystem, B)
all outstanding commands have to complete (since we don't start the
error handler thread until the controller is quiescient), C) we have to
resolve the problem and get to the point of kicking the host back in
gear, and finally D) we have to grab the host_lock before
scsi_request_fn tries to and then we have to try and grab the specific
device_lock that scsi_request_fn is holding.
