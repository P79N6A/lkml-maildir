Remember I suggested this. I don't like the idea but it can be done
for now. Linus as for saying X is really the most important thing
for graphics. Thats your opinion. Please don't force that opinion on the
hacker community that do want to do their own thing. You never know. Some
day something better than X windows might come along. Ignoring it just
because X is the standard would be the same as ignoring linux because
Microsoft windows is the standard.

Well thats where we disagree. I don't believeing in place OpenGL in the
kernel but I do believe the kernels only job is to virtualize the
hardware. To make it seem that this piece of hardware belongs to one
process when in fact its being used in a mulituser environment. Its a
simple but yet beatiful idea. Having userland manage hardware access
will destroy this beauty. As I pointed out userland locking gives you
the best performace at the cost of the system being unstable and having
possible security holes. Its is just plain dangerous for low end hardware.  
You are in the long run end up with more complex tricks that will hurt
performace to deal with these problems.
