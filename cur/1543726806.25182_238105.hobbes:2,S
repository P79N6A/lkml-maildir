[...] So many schedulers. It is hard to chose one for testing.
Do you have one you prefer and would like to be tested especially? 
Perhaps a few standard benchmark numbers for the different ones 
(e.g. volanomark or hackbench or the OSDL SDL tests) would make it 
easier to preselect.
Have you considered submitting one to -mm* for wider testing?
