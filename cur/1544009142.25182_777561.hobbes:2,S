This is from a different thread... unfortunately I forgot to add you to the CC.
It looks like rtl8187 is affected as well.
So let's make new patches and drop the "temporary workaround". (see comment)

I have to apologize...  The problem isn't related to lack of spinlocks.
The problem is that usb_kill_urb() and similar routines do not expect
an URB's completion routine to deallocate it.  This is almost obvious 
-- if the URB is deallocated before the completion routine returns then 
there's no way for usb_kill_urb to detect when the URB actually is 
complete.
One solution is always to deallocate URBs in the stop method rather
than in the completion routine.  But your driver doesn't work that way,
so what you need to do is use an anchor.  Anchors were specifically 
designed to support a "fire and forget" approach, which is what you 
want.
Create and initialize a usb_anchor structure, and each time you create
a new URB, call usb_anchor_urb().  Then you can free the URB as soon as
it is submitted; the anchor will keep it pinned until it completes, and
it is automatically removed from the anchor when the completion routine
is called.
See the kerneldoc for usb_anchor_urb and related routines (such as
urb_kill_anchored_urb) in drivers/usb/core/urb.c, and the anchor
declarations in include/linux/usb.h.
This doesn't mean you should forget about using spinlocks.  Let's look
at the source code:
static void dummy_cb(struct urb *urb)
{
	struct sk_buff *skb = (struct sk_buff *) urb->context;
	struct rx_info *info = (struct rx_info *) skb->cb;
	dev_info(&udev->dev, "dummy cb urb:%p skb:%p status:%d\n",
		 urb, skb, urb->status);
	if (unlikely(urb->status)) {
		info->urb = NULL;
		usb_free_urb(urb);
		return;
	}
	__skb_unlink(skb, &rx_queue);
	dev_kfree_skb(skb);
	usb_free_urb(urb);
}
static void usbtest_stop(void)
{
	struct rx_info *info;
	struct sk_buff *skb;
	while ((skb = skb_dequeue(&rx_queue))) {
		info = (struct rx_info *) skb->cb;
		dev_info(&udev->dev, "Free entry urb:%p skb:%p queue_len:%d\n",
			info->urb, skb, skb_queue_len(&rx_queue));
		if (!info->urb)
			continue;
		usb_kill_urb(info->urb);
		kfree_skb(skb);
	}
}
So there's nothing to stop this sort of thing from happening:
	Thread 0			Thread 1
	--------			--------
	Call usbtest_stop()
	info->urb is not NULL
					Call dummy_cb()
					urb->status is nonzero
					info->urb = NULL;
					usb_free_urb(urb);
	usb_kill_urb(info->urb);
	But info->urb has just been set to NULL!
My original point was that two different routines,
dummy_cb() and usbtest_stop(), both accessed info->urb with no
protection.  Of course, if you use anchors then you won't have to worry 
about this scenario.
