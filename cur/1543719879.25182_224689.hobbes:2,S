> Can't we just stick a PAGE_SIZE in here?
We could - either way works about as well.  Is there something special
about PAGE_SIZE here?  Is that in fact what sysfs is making available?
I can send a PAGE_SIZE hack-a-shaq if you like, or you can just code it
yourself.  If I do it, I will also fix the comment as appropriate. 
Whatever you prefer ...
	len = cpumask_scnprintf(buf, PAGE_SIZE /* XXX FIXME */, mask);
