The most important question to ask here is: What flags did you compile both 
?!? I wouldn't count on the flags that were designed for gcc 2.95 to be any 
good for 3.2... Could the original poster comment on this ?
Any GCC maintainers on this list to comment ? Is there any set of flags to be 
passed to gcc 3.2 to replicate 2.95 behaviour ? I wouldn't rule out gcc 3.2 
having a totaly different set of optimizations geared towards user space C++. 
Again, any gcc maintainers comments ?!? 
Since most of the code in gcc is for C++ most of the changes in gcc should 
have been geared towards C++ (yes - quite a monstrous language). It seems to 
me that the changes in C compilation between 2.95 and 3.2 should be minor 
EXCEPT in terms of C optimization. Can anyone with assembly knowledge take 
apart two identical drivers and see the better machine code produced by 2.95 
as compared to 3.2 ? If so - can this be reported to the gcc folk ?
It seems to me that the difference is so huge that even user space 
applications could show the difference. I suggest compiling a large C program 
(emphasis on the C) in user space and doing the comparison... I would guess 
that this should have been done by the gcc folk but because of the 
hideousness of the C++ language I would guess that they mostly concentrated 
on C++ and didn't bother to benchmark regular C optimization. This is quite 
awful as the bulk of lower level open source code is in C and not C++ so this 
kind of test has a lot of meaning for any distribution that is going to be 
based on gcc 3.2...
If this benchmark turns out to be right then it seems to me that the only 
conclusion is that the gcc folk let their interest in aesoteric features of 
C++ (which has about 1/2 a billion of those) override the basic need for 
strong C optimization. Yes - it now seems that the C++ language (which is 
quite an abomination in terms of engineering and the KISS principle) is 
actually hurting open source (which has been my conclusion for quite some 
time).
