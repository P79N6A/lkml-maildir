No, I don't free_page in try_to_free_buffers. Here it is my current code:
relevant part of try_to_free_buffers:
("int shared" is set if the buffer heads had the BH_Shared bitflag set)
[..]
	/* And free the page */
	page->buffers = NULL;
	if (!shared) {
		buffermem -= PAGE_SIZE;
		return FREE_BUFFER_SUCCESS_LOCAL;
	}
	return FREE_BUFFER_SUCCESS_SHARED;
[..]
relevant part of flushpage:
[..]
	if (!page->buffers)
		return 1;
[..]
	if (!offset)
	{
		int ret;
		ret = try_to_free_buffers(page);
		if (!(ret & (FREE_BUFFER_SUCCESS_SHARED|FREE_BUFFER_BUSY)))
			goto weird;
		unlock_kernel();
		return ret == FREE_BUFFER_SUCCESS_SHARED;
	weird:
		printk(KERN_DEBUG "flushpage: free_buffers retval %d\n", ret);
	}
[..]
relevant part of truncate_inode_pages:
			int additional_refcount;
			get_page(page);
			spin_unlock(&pagecache_lock);
			lock_page(page);
			additional_refcount = 1;
			if (inode->i_op->flushpage)
				if (inode->i_op->flushpage(inode, page, 0))
				{
					additional_refcount = 2;
					lru_pages_del(page);
				}
			/*
			 * We remove the page from the page cache
			 * _after_ we have destroyed all buffer-cache
			 * references to it. Otherwise some other process
			 * might think this inode page is not in the
			 * page cache and creates a buffer-cache alias
			 * to it causing all sorts of fun problems ...
			 */
			remove_inode_page(page);
			UnlockPage(page);
			put_page_refcount(additional_refcount, page);
			page_cache_release(page);
