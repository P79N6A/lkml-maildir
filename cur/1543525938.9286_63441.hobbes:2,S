Indeed, it is possible to just use the 'parent death' signal from prctl()
for this purpose.
Once (not so long ago...), when Tim Wragg was working on pthread
enhancements,
we tried out a (tricky) method which made the manager thread the parent of
all
other threads in the process (including the main thread); after this, if the
manager
failed, other threads got a signal (which they invited via prctl()) and
died.
