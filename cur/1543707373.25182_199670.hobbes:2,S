Hello,
Please find the following patch set for latest version of sysfs backing store. 
I decided to give version number starting from this release expecting more 
changes based on the comments I hope to get. Please note as I am also hoping 
that Andrew may put this first in -mm, this version applies on top on 2.6.3-mm1.
I do have same patch set for mainline, readily available.
Please refer to previous posting for more details/numbers etc

Changes in 0.1
--------------
o Corrected locking in sysfs_umount_begin(), in sysfs-leaves-mount.patch. 
  Thanks to Andrew, for pointing this out.
o Re-diffed all the six patches for 2.6.3-mm1.
Al, it would be great help if you can spare some time in reviewing this.
Thanks
Maneesh
