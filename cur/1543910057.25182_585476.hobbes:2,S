It's easy to be better than something really stupid :)
So i386 and x86-64 don't have volatiles there, and it saves them a
few K of kernel text. What you need to justify is why it is a good
tradeoff to make them volatile (which btw, is much harder to go
the other way after we let people make those assumptions).

Yeah, but we could add lots of things to help prevent bugs and
would never be included. I would also contend that it helps _hide_
bugs and encourages people to be lazy when thinking about these
things.
Also, you dismiss the fact that we'd actually be *adding* volatile
semantics back to the 2 most widely tested architectures (in terms
of test time, number of testers, variety of configurations, and
coverage of driver code). This is a very important different from
just keeping volatile semantics because it is basically a one-way
API change.

I don't know that most people would expect that behaviour. Is there
any documentation anywhere that would suggest this?
Also, barrier() most definitely provides the required functionality.
It is overkill in some situations, but volatile is overkill in _most_
situations. If that's what you're worried about, we should add a new
ordering primitive.

What were you confused about?
