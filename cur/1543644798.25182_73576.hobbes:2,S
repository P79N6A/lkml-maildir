Fair enough.  I actually only need the 64-bit unique ID that the USB device
provides, and its parent PCI device.  EDD provides this info as x86 BIOS
sees it, so my code compares the two, and will make a symlink between the
two.  This lets the OS know which device BIOS thinks it is (i.e. to know
what disk you're booting from).
True, I don't (today) see a unique ID in struct usb_device.  Hopefully
that's something that can be added in the future.  Functions which expose
this info separate from exporting the bus type would be great.
SCSI has a different set of things that EDD needs exported (channel, id,
lun).  IDE still different (channel, number (master/slave)), plus parent PCI
device.
> Oh yeah, it's "driverfs" not "devicefs"  :)
Yes, my bad.
Thanks,
Matt
