Hi,
Sorry, it looks like this message made it through after all - I had
resent it with inline config/etc after it appeared to vanish into a
spam filter somewhere, and discussion is happening in that thread
instead: 
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/779350
(message-id <20090112172613.GA8746@shion.is.fushizen.net>)
It's been bisected there, and I believe there's a revert queued
already as a short-term fix.
Thanks,
Bryan Donlan
