Looking at the code in lio kernel patch, this should be already covered:
        if (iocb->ki_signo)
                __aio_send_signal(iocb);
+       if (iocb->ki_lio)
+               lio_check(iocb->ki_lio);
That is, it first checks the notification in the individual iocb, and then
the one for the LIO.

I imagine the kernel could enable this by incorporating this additional
parameter for IOCB_CMD_GROUP in the ABI (in the default case this should be the
same as the total number of iocbs submitted to lio_listio). Now should the
at least NENT check apply only to LIO_WAIT or also to the LIO_NOWAIT
notification case ? 
BTW, the native io_getevents does support a min_nr wakeup already, except that
it applies to any iocb on the io_context, and not just a given lio_listio call.
