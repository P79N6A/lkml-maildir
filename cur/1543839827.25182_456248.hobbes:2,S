This is a digression from spidernet, but what if a device is able to
generate separate MSIs for TX and RX?  Some people from IBM have
suggested that it is beneficial for throughput to handle TX work and
RX work for IP-over-InfiniBand in parallel on separate CPUs, and
handling everything through the ->poll() method would defeat this.
