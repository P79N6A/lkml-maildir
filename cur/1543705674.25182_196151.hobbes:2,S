Wouldn't it make more sense to go the other way? Ie have the PCI devices 
be pointed to from the OF paths?
I'd prefer to avoid having OF-specific files in a PCI directory. That just 
leads to inherently unportable user mode stuff. In contrast, having the OF 
directory entry that points to the hardware (PCI) entry makes perfect 
sense.
umm?
