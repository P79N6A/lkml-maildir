Jes,
I've been debugging a new acenic device for HP and have been using a
linux machine for bring up.  One of the problems we encountered was a
need to change the cards MAC address.  Under linux ia32, the driver set
an invalid MAC address.  If I would
say 
	ifconfig eth0 hw ether 00:01:23:45:67:89 (for example only)
Linux would know of it's correct MAC address, but the card had a
different 
address.  Through reading of the MAC registers (offset 0xb80-0xbf0), the
card
thought it's MAC address was 01:00:45:23:89:67.  Attached is a patch
that
would not do the halfword byte swapping.
Also, I have tested this device driver on a HP XU-800 Kayak (IA32) using
the HP 1000Base-T Lan Adapter A4929A device (copper), but it should also
work on the HP 1000Base-SX Lan Adapter A4926A (fiber).  Both of these
devices are 64-bit PCI.  I've not been able to test the A4924A or A4925A
because they are both on the (HP's) HSC bus.
These device specs can be found at:
A4926A -
http://www.unixsolutions.hp.com/products/networking/links/1000base.html
A4929A -
http://www.unixsolutions.hp.com/products/networking/links/gigetlpg.html
The attached patch is against version 0.46.  I also have a device driver
that allows me to dump all the acenic registers.  Let me know if you're
interested in a #define'd out patch.
