I dont think this patch will be sufficient - There is another problem
with the driver - What for example happens if we are in the
gdth_interrupt - we do have locked the HA because we are not in polling
mode. Then the error handler kicks in and sets polling_mode to TRUE -
Now the gdth_interrupt will not unlock the HA which will get one cpu to
keep spinning in the error handler.
I think calling the gdth_interrupt in polling and non-polling mode is
bogus by design.
