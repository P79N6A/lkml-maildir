The way that patch is right now (and has been for some time) is kind of nasty,
and could use cleaning up.  I made a half-assed attempt at improving it
a little over xmas, but it could rewriting from scratch.
That's the only reason I never bothered pushing it (and I assume, the reason
that Arjan didn't push it when he wrote the original).
