No problem with this, but since it was Jeff's patch it should better be 
him who reverts it (and he's anyway one step nearer to Linus).
But the underlying general problem still remains:
How can we get people to test and report bugs with the new drivers 
before removing the old driver?
That's a question especially for the people who now had problems after 
sk98lin was removed.
