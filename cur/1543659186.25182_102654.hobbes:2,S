Hey, if the compiler does it's job right, I increased the speed of
something in the kernel.  And, as a kernel newbie, I'm proud of that.  I
also did it in under 12 minutes (from time stamp of message received to
time stamp of message sent after code compiled and diff'd).

I thought it was easier to read.  For me, I can read "ok, this condition
happens, I fail"... Or "if this other condition happens, I release my
path, then I fail"...  
Whereas the "goto out" was very unclear.  It made me page down to figure
out what was going on.  
That's the whole point.. To just browse the code.. I shouldn't have to
page down to understand what the code right in front of me is doing. 
"goto out" is unclear.  "retun error" is clear.  "path_release" seems
like a relatively plain english function name and I can guess what it
does without knowing exactly what it does.  I can also surmise that if I
go beyond a certain point in the function that I need to path_release()
the same way a non-kernel programmer might need to free memory allocated
inside of a function before returning to the calling function. 
It really is that simple.

It took me 12 minutes from message received to message sent to update
the entire block of code to handle the new case.  How long do you think
it would take to make a minor modification that would only have to do a
portion of what I did?  Is it such a burden on the developer to make the
code more readable?
