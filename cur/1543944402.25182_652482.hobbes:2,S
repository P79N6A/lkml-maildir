Yes, that's exactly what I was suggesting.  The __deprecate only lasts
for the merge window, and we remove the old API at the end of the
merge window.  So it's only there for a very short time, and it's only
there to make the cleen sweep a little less painful --- not one where
"shit hangs around in the tree forever".
