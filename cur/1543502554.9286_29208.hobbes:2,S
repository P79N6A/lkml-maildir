Hi Marnix.

We're still here, yes.
Something happenned to vger sometime on Sunday, as all the mailing
lists I take from there slowed right down, but they went back to
normal around 10:30am UTC Monday, so if you're still not getting
anything, you've probably been dropped off the list...
Best wishes from Riley.
