Nice work.  However, you forgot the other half of the job - finding out
how many BK "patches" got merged into Linus' tree, and how many GNU
patches.  Only then can we make a real comparison.
And yes, I've done Linus a favour - I've deleted him from the CC: list
because he's said he's not interested in this discussion.
