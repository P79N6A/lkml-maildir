I've not yet started active searching. However:
	- test5		is fine
	- test13-pre3	is not
I don't know how fast your machine is, but we should coordinate out
search... I'll try to build -test10final (with minimal config to
only test boot) so that shouldn't take so very long... You should
test sth around -test8...
