Cool.
One thing I wonder about - could you separate out the bug-ons and warnings 
from the oopses? They really are different issues, and an oops with 
register information etc is very different from a BUG() with line numbers, 
which in turn is very different from a WARN_ON().
Right now, it says
	Oopses reported for kernel 2.6.24-rc7
	7 oopses reported
	hfsplus_releasepage	3
	enqueue_task		1
	lock_acquire		1
	__hfs_brec_find		1
	__ieee80211_rx		1
and in fact three of those five entries are really WARN_ON's. It would be 
nicer if it would look more along the lines of
	Backtraces reported for kernel 2.6.24-rc7
	4 oopses reported
	hfsplus_releasepage     3
	__hfs_brec_find         1
	3 warnings repored
	enqueue_task            1
	lock_acquire            1
	__ieee80211_rx          1
because those things really don't have the same kind of impact at all, and 
tend to be very different to debug (a "BUG_ON()" is perhaps somewhat 
closer to an oops, but a WARN_ON() is definitely in a class of its own).
On that "Code:" side, it seems there is still some problem with oops 
parsing. See for example:
	
http://www.kerneloops.org/raw.php?rawid=1521&msgid=http
://mid.gmane.org/20071017154655.GA13394@elte.hu
and notice how the Code: never made it into the raw message (and thus 
there is also no instruction disassembly).
