I worked on patches to take away the 512-byte restriction for memory
addresses a while ago - but had to use 4-byte alignment for some 
drivers to make it work. I gave up since, there was no way for me
to methodically prove that it will work on all drivers :(
O_DIRECT mount option is the one our software group people keep
asking for (since they use it on Solaris) - we keep telling them
NO !! Their basic complaint *was* - use/population of pagecache 
by other applications (tar, ftp, scp, backup) in the system, 
causing performance degrade for their application. But again,
2.6.x had gotten lot better and we have hundreds of tunables
to control various behaviours and problem can be *theoritically*
worked around with these tunables.
