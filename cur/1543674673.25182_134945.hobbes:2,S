That's why POSIX says no such thing.
What it *does* say is
  Upon successful completion, if fildes refers to a regular file, the
  ftruncate() function shall mark for update the st_ctime and st_mtime
  fields of the file and the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may
  be cleared. If the ftruncate() function is unsuccessful, the file is
  unaffected.
See:

Is it really so hard to look it up that we need to spout FUD instead?
