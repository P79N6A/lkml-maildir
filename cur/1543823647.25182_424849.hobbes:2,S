	My sister can testify that it's possible but there's really no point. She
has a P60 with 128MB of RAM (the max her mobo can take) and it takes about 2
minutes to launch firefox. She uses gmail, and it's basically unusable on
her machine. Almost once every day I send her another configuration for a
machine I recommend she should buy to end her suffering. She says she uses
her machine so little it's not worth it. I point out that she uses it so
little because it is useful for so little.
