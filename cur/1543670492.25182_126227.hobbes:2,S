IDE disks automatically remap defective sectors, so you won't see any
of them unless the disk is already quite broken.
Some disks (notably the IBM DTLA series) cannot deal with sudden power
failures during write operators.  In such a case, the sector has an
incorrect checksum and cannot be read until after the next write.
