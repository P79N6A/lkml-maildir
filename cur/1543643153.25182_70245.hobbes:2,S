And if one of your daemons has a slow memory leak then this happens:
You go OOM after a while (hours, days) - a user program is killed.  
Buth the leaky dameon is running, so after a shorter time you go OOM
again.
Another user program is killed.  This goes on for a while, it becomes
hard
to log in to fix things because the freshly logged in administrator
has a very new process and is the first to go!
After a while, all user programs are gone and daemons die one by one
until the offending one goes.  Or perhaps the offending damon
don't leak anymore - it might be sshd but there is not enough memory
to log in so it don't get to leak any more.

Again, a bad daemon (pid < 5000) will slowly take out everything else,
with login impossible in the meantime.

Any way you protect a bunch of processes might fail if the bad one
is among them.  Also, the OOM killer will have to fall back
to the standard heuristic whenever there is only protected
processes left.
