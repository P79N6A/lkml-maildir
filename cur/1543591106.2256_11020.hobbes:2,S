I would have to agree that "stable" is critical to not driving people
crazy.  In the case of AIX, once a device is enumerated, it will retain
the same name across reboots.  Enough information is kept about each
device to determine if it has already been enumerated (i.e. same I/O
port address for serial devices, MAC address for ethernet cards, etc),
or if it is a new device and should get a new name.

Without stable names it is basically impossible to make any sort of
reasonable configuration decision, unless the configuration can be
stored on the device itself.  That works for disks, and not much else.

I disagree here.  In many cases you only have a very limited number of
devices of each type (or only 1), so you don't want to be bogged down
with physical device naming.  If you have lots of a given type of device
(e.g. disks), you _also_ don't want to be bogged down with physical
device naming, because it will NOT be consistent across different physical
access methods.  In both cases, you want a generic name PLUS a way to
find out the physical characteristics (attributes) of the device to do
INITIAL configuration.  If the device keeps a constant name across
reboots, you don't care how it is accessed after the first configuration.
Cheers, Andreas
