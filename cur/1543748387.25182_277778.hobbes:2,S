interactive tasks do get thrown back, but they wont ever preempt RT
tasks. RT tasks themselves can starve any lower-prio process
indefinitely. Interactive tasks can starve other tasks up to a certain
limit, which is defined via STARVATION_LIMIT, at which point we empty
the active array and perform an array switch. (also see
EXPIRED_STARVING())
