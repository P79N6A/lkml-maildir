The driver should do the logical to physical mapping, but the portability
vanishes if the filesystem to physical mapping is not the same for all
machines and operating systems. For pluggable devices this is important.
The leveling seems to be done by JFFs2 in a portable way, and that's as it
should be. If the leveling were in the driver I don't believe even FAT
would work.
