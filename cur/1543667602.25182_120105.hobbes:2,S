Patch works and reenables modular pcmcia to work. Thanks Dominik !
Except that those recent changes in the pcmcia broke the Red Hat (8.0)
boot scripts. Whether the problem lies in the scripts or the new 
module dependencies is questionable.
The problem comes from the fact that loading ds.o would fail if
a socket driver is not already loaded. In the new kernel it just
wload sucessfuly.
As a side effect of that the interface is recognised as a wireless
one, and the pcmcia starting script finally doesn't load yenta_socket
because , as pcmcia_core is already loaded, it believes it is already
started. But as I said, the script logic is questionable.
Stelian.
