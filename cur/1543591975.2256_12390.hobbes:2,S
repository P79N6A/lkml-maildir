Why use a cross compiler? With the obvious exception of UML, the Linux
kernel is not a Linux executable, so why should it need to be compiled with
a compiler which targets such? 
The kernel compiles quite happily with compilers which aren't targetted 
specifically at Linux -- the CODA compatibility cruft being the one 
exception. I often just comment out the CODA includes from <linux/fs.h> to 
get round the same problem.
