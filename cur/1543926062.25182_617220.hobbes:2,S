Just to add my 2 cents, I've not seen any CompactPCI gear that had a
way to easily map a PCI peripheral slot to the corresponding physical
slot in the chassis.  In the products I've worked on that use my CPCI
hotplug drivers, we did any required mapping in userspace based on
knowledge of the chassis layout for the particular product.
