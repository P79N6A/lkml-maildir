Good day, gentlemen,
	Sorry for not knowing exactly who should get this...
	In prepatch 2.2.5-2, some new defines were added to if_arp.h:
+/* ARP works differently on different FC media .. so  */
+#define ARPHRD_FCPP    784             /* Point to point fibrechanel   */
+#define ARPHRD_FCAL    785             /* Fibrechannel arbitrated loop */
+#define ARPHRD_FCPL    786             /* Fibrechannel public loop     */
+#define ARPHRD_FCFABRIC        786             /* Fibrechannel fabric  */
+       /* 787->799 reserved for fibrechannel media types */
	It _appears_ that the rest of the defines are unique.  Is the fact
that both ARPHRD_FCPL and ARPHRD_FCFABRIC are both 786 a problem?  It
could very reasonably be intentional; if so my apologies.
	No response is required; I just wanted to bring it to your
attention.
	Cheers,
	- Bill
