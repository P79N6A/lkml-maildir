Subject: [PATCH] has_stopped_jobs cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/16/22

This check has been obsolete since the introduction of TASK_TRACED.
Now TASK_STOPPED always means job control stop.
