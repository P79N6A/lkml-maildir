Hell no.
This is an example of how to do things WRONG. In short, it's not an 
example we want to have in the kernel, or anywhere _near_ the kernel.
Do it right, or don't do it at all. Code this bad should not be allowed to 
exist, please remove it from your harddisk immediately. I will go and wash 
my eyes from just having looked at it.
