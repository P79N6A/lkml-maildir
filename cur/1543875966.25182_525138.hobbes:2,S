at least wrt. suspend/resume it should be fine, because in 
arch/x86_64/kernel/time.c it does this upon resume:
 static int timer_resume(struct sys_device *dev)
 {
         if (hpet_address)
                 hpet_reenable();
         else
                 i8254_timer_resume();
[ barring the issue that mixing two pieces of hardware like this in a 
  single resume function is wrong - all timer hardware should be 
  separated like we did it for i386. I've got 64-bit clockevents code in 
  -rt which does this separation. ]

there's no fundamental reason. x86_64 COW-ed hpet_timer.c and 
time_hpet.c years ago and drifted off into different areas.
They should be unified: more power to arch/x86/ ;-)
