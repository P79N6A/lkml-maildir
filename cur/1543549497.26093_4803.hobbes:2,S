They get sent to the original process.
The debugger then catches the actual signal handler event, see
arch/i386/kernel/signal.c. 
Remember: debug traps work even without debuggers. You can use a "int 3"
in your program if you want to have self-debug somewhere. Not many people
do it, of course, but there's nothing fundamentally wrong in just catching
SIGTRAP yourself, and doing something special on debug events.
