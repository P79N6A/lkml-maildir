Subject: [PATCH] fbdev currcon
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch only applies for the -dj tree since the new fbdev api is going
in there for now. This patch makes every fbdev driver uses the currcon
that I have placed in struct fb_info. Currently most drivers have currcon,
not the one for the console system, global. This is a problem if you have
more than one card. I have tested to see if this compiles on ix86 but
this patch is extensive so I like people to apply this patch to test it
out against the dj14 tree. The patch is to big to post so it is avalibale
at the following link:
NOTE: The setcolreg patch has to be applied first.
