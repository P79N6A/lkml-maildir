What should happen when I unplug a USB-storage device with mounted filesystems
that are in use?
At the moment, it simply kills the USB port that it's on, it won't recognise
anything plugged into it later.
Sort-of understandably, the scsi-module won't now unload, nor will the usb-storage
or USB ones.
Obviously, this isn't intentional, but my MP3 player has a very badly designed
connector.
