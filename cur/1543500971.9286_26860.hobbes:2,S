If the fs is single threaded, I assume that it's protected by some form
of lock, and every process that waits for I/O will sleep, i.e. not accumulate
CPU time. The parallel kernel compiles did not only take longer, they also spent
more time in the CPU. Even if the fs code was protected by a spin lock, this
would only show up in the system time, not in the user time ...
Did I miss anything ?
