I hate to say this but you are starting to behave like a spoiled
little child in your witch hunt against Stallman.
Before you continue acting like a complete moron, try to go study what
SPAM actually is. _You_ may consider Stallman's postings as SPAM, well
they are not, they _might_ be off-topic, depending on how you look at
it, but that does not make it SPAM.
So please take your personal vengenace somewhere else, it does NOT
belong here.
