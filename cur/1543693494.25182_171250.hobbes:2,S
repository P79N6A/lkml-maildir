Not all arches have atomic_set_mask() and atomic_clear_mask().
asm-arm
asm-arm26
asm-h8300
asm-i386
asm-m68k
asm-m68knommu
asm-ppc
asm-s390
asm-sh
asm-v850
asm-x86_64
do.

There definitely is when RMAP is present - we've reproduced it
repeatedly in our labs.
We've seen a similar failure with the RHEL2.1 kernel w/o RMAP patches
