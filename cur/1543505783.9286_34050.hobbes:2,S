I think the only module I have unloaded is the isofs, when I tried to mount
a cdrom that wasn't in the drive. Another thing I remember having done
during this uptime that I don't usually do is setting up dhcpd.
I could try rebooting and seeing if doing the cdrom mount attempt makes any
difference, but as that sounds like a rather unlikely cause, it might make
more sense to not boot the machine while I can repeat the problem.
