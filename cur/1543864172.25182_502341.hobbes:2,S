Thanks.  There may be more to it than what I suspect, but I could not
reproduce it on x86_64.
Now I may have missed something as I optimized my tested based on the fact
that close and open are triggered when you up and down a network interface.
so I didn't do a complete rmmod, (since my network driver wasn't modular).
Since you have seen this on x86_64 I will look deeper.
