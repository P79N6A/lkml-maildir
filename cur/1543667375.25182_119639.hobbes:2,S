Ok. It compiles OK now (apart from some warnings for the janitors). I am
currently running 2.6.65-ac3 with it (well actually due to EXTRA_VERSION
still being -ac2 it thinks it is -ac2 ;-) To Alan from my phrase book:
"Peidiwch a gwneud hyn eto - pum punt o ddirwy!)
Only tested on i386, I still haven't decided whether a Power Mac is
worth the extra money, and my last HP machine was years ago ;-)
I don't seem to be a power genrtc user: I had to rmmod rtc before modprobe
genrtc succeeded but it does work:
$ cat /proc/driver/rtc
rtc_time	: 11:49:52
rtc_date	: 2003-03-23
rtc_epoch	: 1900
alarm		: 00:00:00
DST_enable	: no
BCD		: yes
24hr		: yes
square_wave	: no
alarm_IRQ	: no
update_IRQ	: no
periodic_IRQ	: no
periodic_freq	: 0
batt_status	: okay
Thanks, Marco Roeland
