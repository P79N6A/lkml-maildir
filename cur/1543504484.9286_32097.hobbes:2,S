Hi all,
It was not my profile, I only forwarded it to Benno.
It was found on the list, as "Excessive System time in MSP kernel."
And it was run on a 512 MB Dual Pentium(!) system.
[Note: maximum memory on a (well, two) slow Pentium, but the timing
 for each function should be the same]
When I reported it I was running in Win95 I could not check out
man readprofile (and I can not now either...)
I noted that I was guessing a little but the data did look
like it was number of calls, label, average time (look at
total line)... [I am in a process of moving all my lists
from Win95 to Linux, but I am waiting for my ISP to add
some mail accounts...]
I have a patch of my own, not related to data in the above
thread, that measures the time from setting of
current->need_resched to the actual (re)scheduling takes place.
It also samples instruction pointer at jiffies and prints data in
schedule() if latency is longer than 5 ms (i.e. definable)
 - and that happens a lot!
[I have kept it private group since it is my first patch and
I do not think that it is SMP safe... or safe in any other
way...]
And the readprofile from the forwarded thread "matches" the
data I get...
There are stuff that takes several jiffies before it
reschedules... (PPro 180, 96MB)

I fully agree!
But Ingos patches are a nice start - they show that it can be done!

The Internet interprets Windows as damage, 
             and routes around it.
