The DoS is simple: create a bunch of periodic timers with 10usec period.
This can be done by any user.
There is no inaccuracy when you rearm the timer on read: hrtimer_forward
takes care, that the period is accurate. It does not start the timer out
of the periodic order, i.e. on a different time frame.
Where is the win of keeping the timer running, when nobody cares about
the expiry at all ? It just generates interrupts and events for nothing.
