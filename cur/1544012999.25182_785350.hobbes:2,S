There's nothing special about fasync() itself.  The problem is that the
setting of the FASYNC flag and the associated call to fasync() need to
be atomic, lest the driver/filesystem and the VFS end up with differing
ideas about the setting of that flag.  In the absence of that
constraint, one could just use the normal bit operations on f_flags.
