	Logical geometry used by Linux must be such that Linux can calculate the
	correct physical geometry from it.
False.
	Now, IDE disks can have at most 16 *physical* heads. If you tell the kernel
	that the geometry of your disk is 787/128/63 (as with my 3G Western Digital)
	the kernel will use the *physical* geometry 6296/16/63 for C/H/S addressing
	(it's deduced from the logical geometry you specify, knowing Heads<=16)
False.
	Till now things are simple: get your disk *physical* geometry,
	invent a COMPATIBLE logical geometry and tell it to the kernel.
	By 'compatible' I mean: the kernel must be able to deduce the correct physical
	geometry from it. It's easy since the kernel divides by 2 the number of heads
	and multiplies by 2 the numbers of cylinders, until heads<=16, to get the
	physical geometry.
Hogwash. Please do not spread nonsense if you do not know
what you are talking about.
