Hello Vivek,
thank you very much for looking at this problem, and for your

We have made a number of logical analyzer traces. In all cases
where the error occurred, there was a INT message from the IO-APIC
that never received an EOI. These INT messages always occurred shortly
before or during machine_crash_shutdown(); unfortunately it is
impossible from analyzer traces to tell exactly when
machine_crash_shutdown() was entered.
Such a situation has never been observed in the "good" case.
So, we do have some evidence, not just bare speculation.

Can you explain how, on the front side bus, the IO-APIC knows whether
a CPU has accepted the INT message? There is no response
to the INT message on the bus, except for the EOI which comes much later.
I'm not saying that you're wrong, I just really don't understand this
point.
In the logical analyzer, we can't see when exactly the local APICs are
disabled. But we see that IRQs arriving after the IO APIC pin is
masked never do any harm, while IRQs arriving "during the shutdown
sequence" (we can see e.g. the 2nd CPU taking the bus after the NMI
IPI) cause the error situation.

In an earlier patch, I tried to add that same code in
machine_crash_shutdown() and crash_nmi_callback(),  in order
to send EOIs for pending IRQs on all CPUs. Unfortunately,
that had no effect.

Hmm... ioapic_mask_entry() writes
"union entry_union eu = { .entry.mask = 1 }" to the  LVT register.
That clears all bits except the mask bit, so that the vector information
is lost. Please correct me if I'm mistaken.

So far I haven't come up with a patch that just sends EOI without
actually calling any HW IRQ handler. That would clarify this question.
It's on my todo list.

That has been done in the past. The error occurs, too, although not
quite as often.

We always see the IO-APIC IRR  bit in the error situation, before and
after the start of the kdump kernel.
*Before* the kdump kernel starts (more precisely: before the call
to disable_IO_APIC()), the IO-APIC "delivery status" bit is also set.
I checked local APIC ISR and IRR bits in an earlier version of my patch
(see above). They were sometimes set, and sometimes not (unlike the IO-APIC
IRR/Delivery Status which behave always the same).
The patch was very different at that time, e.g. it didn't call the
crash_mask_IO_APIC() function yet. So perhaps, it's worth a try to
modify it and just send EOI on all CPUs instead of enabling interrupts.
I'll put it on the toto list, too.
Regards and thanks
Martin
