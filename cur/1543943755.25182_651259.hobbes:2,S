this is a small detail, but you are wrong. These braces around 
multi-line statements are unneded _for the compiler_, but are very much 
wanted by humans. You'll see akpm, me and others reject/fix patches on a 
routine basis that make this cleanliness mistake. Please watch out for 
this when writing patches ;-)

nope. I consciously avoid that construct because it's dangerous: it can 
quite easily result in the wrong logic. Having _more_ braces than needed 
by the compiler is a style error in only a single, special case.

agreed - fixed.
