Subject: Kernel panic with 2.6.23-rc5

Hi, all
I just tried booting a brand new 2.6.23-rc5 and after a few minutes it 
just panicked: machine totally frozen, blinking keyboard leds.
I tried setting up a netconsole to get a trace of the panic, but nothing 
panic related appears there (only the normal boot up messages).
The problem is the last kernel I was using was a 2.6.21, so this is a 
really large changeset to debug, and I don't have much time to try 
different kernels to narrow this down.
Anyway, attached are both kernel configs and boot dmesg's.
Maybe someone out there has a good suggestion that I could try before 
bisecting...
