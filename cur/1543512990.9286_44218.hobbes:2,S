Ummm, that is because you have limits on your stack. But if you type ulimit
that might show the problem. (Why is it that it says seg fault, when a more
appropriate message would be stack overflow?).
Anyway that program I posted before was a pretty bad example. A better example
would be :
#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
	main();
}
Cheers Mof.
