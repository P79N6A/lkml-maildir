I'm thinking of making the default implementation of mutexes a straight
wrapper around down() and up(). That way it'll be exactly the same as counting
semaphores, just with extra constraints when the debugging is enabled _and_
effectively extra inline documentation.
But! for archs where it does matter (and we have several - you might not care,
but others do), it can be overridden with something faster.
