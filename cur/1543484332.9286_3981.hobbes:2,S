In defense of yodaiken@chelm.cs.nmt.edu (I think I've lost the original
email with the realname attached), he has already realized in private mail
that he accidentally misread my message to construe that I was talking
about 2.0->2.2, not 2.0.n to 2.0.n+1 like I meant it to say. So, we don't
need to keep harping on that - it was an honest mistake.
