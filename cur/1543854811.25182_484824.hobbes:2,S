We found this bug actually through a code review by random. Since
(un)fortunately the queue pages were layouted in order, we've not
seen it earlier. It's certainly a bug and can cause kernel panic 
if above observation is not met, probably in stress situation
of system. That means the "former" code accesses next page that 
it has not allocated.
Thanks
