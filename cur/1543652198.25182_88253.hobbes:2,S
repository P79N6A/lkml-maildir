depends what side you are benchmarking, not always more throughput means
less interactivity, but at some point (when the more throughput can't
payoff for the reordering anymore) it does.
You should definitely benchmark 2.4.19-ck9 and 2.4.20rc1aa2 with dbench
too. Those numbers as is doesn't show the whole picture.
