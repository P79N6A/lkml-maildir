absolutely
real life example: hook up one of those fancy usb keyboards with volume buttons to
your thinkpad. The volume keys on the thinkpad do adjust the volume, the ones on
the USB keyboard do not - software needs to be able to distinguish between them,
and sane defaults for these events need to not overlap.
