No, it's fairly lurchy with three root chew-max and one user chew-max
running.  Moving the mouse around while they're running, I can see/feel
the load, and max latency for the user chew-max quickly shoots to
>500ms.
Running the same with mainline + full revert, the load is not palpable
and max latency  for user task was 83ms.
Group CPU distribution otoh is better than mainline git + full revert.
