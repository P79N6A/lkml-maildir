I'm not sure whether this should be in generic block layer or in libata 
proper.  libata sysfs hierarchy isn't there yet but is scheduled to be 
added soon.  Async notification of media change is generic event for any 
block device with removable media, so I guess it can belong to generic 
layer.  BTW, I think you also need to forward the flag in sd - disk 
device can be removable too.  And please cc linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org 
to get SCSI part reviewed.
Thanks.
