Subject: [PATCH] 2.6.14 - Fix for incorrect CPU speed determination in powernow for i386
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

On an HP ze1115 notebook with a Mobile AMD K7, the CPU speed is measured twice, once when the CPU is initialized, and a second time when the powerrnow system is started. Sometimes the two readings agree; however, the second reading is usually higher, sometimes by very large factors. The dmesg excerpts below show one case where the difference is small.
Initializing CPU#0
PID hash table entries: 4096 (order: 12, 65536 bytes)
Detected 1100.134 MHz process
powernow: PowerNOW! Technology present. Can scale: frequency and voltage.
Detected 1148.044 MHz processor.
powernow: SGTC: 10000
powernow: Minimum speed 521 MHz. Maximum speed 1148 MHz.
The cpu frequency on this machine is measured using calibrate_tsc, which calls mach_countup between rdtsc calls. When the second speed determination is made, interrupts have been enabled, which makes the loop counter value in mach_count to be too small and the cpu frequency to be too high.
The two-line patch against 2.6.14 is shown below. With it, a second (faulty) determination of cpu_khz is avoided. BTW, this fix handles Bugzilla bugs #5266 and 5435.
