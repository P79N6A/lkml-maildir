In 2.4.x, the input layer converts input events to PC/AT scancodes, and still
relies on the PS/2 low-level keyboard driver scancode conversion to interprete
them. This means you must include the PS/2 low-level keyboard driver. If you
don't, you may get strange results, especially on architectures where you have
a different low-level keyboard driver.
BTW, I guess your arrow keys are not working?
