Yeah, I guess the context here matters (and is a little hard to follow
because thare are a few places that change in different ways here):
For allocating pages from a particular node (GFP_THISNODE with nid),
the nid clearly must be specified. This only happens with
alloc_pages_node(), AFAICT. So, in that interface, the right thing is
done and the appropriate nodemask will be built.
On the other hand, if we call alloc_pages() with GFP_THISNODE set, there
is no nid to base the allocation on, so we "fallback" to numa_node_id()
[ almost like the nid had been specified as -1 ].
So I guess this is logical -- but I wonder, do we have any callers of
alloc_pages(GFP_THISNODE) ? It seems like an odd thing to do, when
alloc_pages_node() exists?
Thanks,
Nish
