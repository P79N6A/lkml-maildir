I have only one machine that is still running a v2.4 kernel (from ftp.kernel.org), and that is an
old P120 that I occasionally use as a wireless acess point.
The compiler on this P120 is indeed gcc-3.4. However, building any kernel on that machine is now
so excruciatingly painful that I am considering using a newer, beefier machine as a build machine
instead. That machine is running FC5, and so uses gcc-4.1. So from my perspective, being able to
build a 2.4 kernel using gcc-4.x would be a benefit.
Cheers,
Chris
