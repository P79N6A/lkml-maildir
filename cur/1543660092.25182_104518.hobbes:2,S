oops, as i was reading this thread I thought lets try to burn again, as it 
did not work around 2.5.56.
your first question was: is it possible to burn without idescsi under 2.5.56? 
so i answered that one and so i mist the 'dvd' part in your second question...
if it can burn in sao/dao i don't know, will try that later
