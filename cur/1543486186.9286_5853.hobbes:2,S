Thank you Lieven Willems.  I stand corrected.

Thanks. Kludgy, but effective. I think my current setup is cleaner. A
problem I would forsee is if rmmod -a removes the Symbios module, but not
the Adaptec module.  Maybe that's why I don't rmmod -a.  It's probably a
problem with my setup as well.  I had not thought of that before. Modules:
can't live with them; can't live without them.
I was actually going to ask you directly, but I figured I'd give you a rest.
I think I've being going to you directly too many times. If you ever have a
whitewater kayaking question, feel free to bug me. :-)
-Eric ;-)
