Hi All,
  1.  Is there a file which contains all the tunables??
  2. Are the variables - free_pages_high & free_pages_low  (, which the
kswapd looks for after the timer expires), 	tunable parameters??
  3. What  range of addresses  separates the Normal, High Memory
      & DMA zones??
 Thanks & Regards,
 Srikanth
