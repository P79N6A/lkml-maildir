The current scheme is obviously deficient, and really isn't worth making
such changes to.  The Right Way to fix the whole system is to perform
writes through the page cache instead, which we'll do in 2.3.  That
completely eliminates a whole class of problems surrounding
double-buffering in the current write code.  It's the only fix which
makes sense.  
Cheers,
 Stephen
