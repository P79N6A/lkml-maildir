Hi,
I have a machine with 4 160G disks in a raid-0 configuration. Now
after upgrading the hardware, all of a sudden raidstart can't find the
raid-superblocks anymore. Invalid magic. 
I'm suspecting that it might be that the superblock was overwritten
with data or something like that. Does anybody know of a bug like
this?
We're running kernel-2.4.16 with andre's IDE patches for the large
disks.
I'll see if I can find the "magic" anywhere on the disk....
				Roger.
