The patch looks fine as far as it goes ... however, shouldn't we be
spinning *internal* suspended drives down as well like IDE does (i.e. at
least the sd ULD needs to be a party to the suspend)?  Of course this is
a complete can of worms since we really have no idea which busses are
internal and which are external, although it might be something that
userland can determine.
