No, they'd upgrade in that case.

Neither posix nor flock locks delay a lock because of pending
conflicting locks.  SUS, as I read it, wouldn't allow that.

If you want fairness the best that you can do is to ensure that when
more than one pending lock can be applied, the one that has been waiting
longest will be chosen.  But you can't make all such lock requests wait
for a lock that hasn't even been applied yet.
You can contrive examples of applications that would be correct given
the standard fcntl behavior, but that would deadlock on a system that
didn't allow read locks to jump the queue in the above situation.  I
have no idea whether such applications actually exist in practice, but
I'd be uneasy about changing the standard behavior without inventing
some new kind of lock.
