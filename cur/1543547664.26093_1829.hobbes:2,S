I'm not against sending the old size, it could be useful.  But, your 
truncate operation wants to find the old size on its own.  If the data in 
the on disk stat data is at all out of date (likely if you allow the 
dirty inode list to do your inode flushing, and have a crash) you need to 
find the real size of the file before truncating it.
Of course, fsck fixes this, and logging (or phasing) the inode with each 
file size modification should do the same, but if you're not fscking on 
dirty mount, it is probably a good idea to verify the file size during a 
truncate.
