Woops. This looks like it only makes sure there's enough to get the
first ->show() into the buffer; I see that it later gives up when
m->count == m->size once the first ->show() has enough bufferspace to
complete later on. So if all ->show() operations to do are less than
PAGE_SIZE, it'll never hand back more than a page at a time, and may
hand back short reads prior to EOF, which doesn't bode well for my
short read == EOF idea (maybe not a great assumption in general).
