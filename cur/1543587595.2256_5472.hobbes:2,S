I've gone this one better.  It's now "Y", "m", " ", so the m and y
responses are easily distinguished.

Implemented.

You make good points.  In the 1.1.1, blue and yellow/brown will be gone;
it's just green for everything visited.

Fixed.

Rules-file patches will be cheerfully accepted.

I know.  The workaround is to use gnome-term, which for some reason
doesn't show this.  It's tops on my longer-term to-do list.

On my to-do list.

The men and women who founded our country knew, by experience, that there
are times when the free person's answer to oppressive government has to be
delivered with a bullet.  Thus, the right to bear arms is not just *a*
freedom; it's the mother of all freedoms.  Don't let them disarm you!
