Should be nearly the same in theory, no. This means 32bit programs use %gs
as thread register which is a bit more costly to switch because
the kernel uses it internally too, but the difference should be less
than that.
I suspect your program is more testing the locks anyways, perhaps
there is some other difference in the glibc. e.g. 32bit glibc compiled
for pre 686 CPUs has slower locks.
oprofile might provide more clue where the overhead is.
