  I agree strongly with Donald.
  Interfaces should NEVER change in patch level versions.
  Just *DO NOT DO IT*.
  Go wild in odd-numbered.. get the interfaces right there.
  But leave them alone afterward.
  
  This is a fundamental tenant of being professional. Otherwise, the kernel

  Microsoft is not the real enemy. Gratuitous change is.
