Hmmm. So w/ -mm2 we're seeing the TSC get detected as running too slowly
(and its replaced w/ the ACPI PM), but for some reason that doesn't
happen w/ the dynticks patch.
Now, how is cpuspeed changing the cpufreq? Is it using the /sys
interface? I've got hooks in so when the cpufreq changes we should mark
it unstable and fall back to ACPI PM, but maybe I missed whatever hook
cpuspeed is using.
thanks
