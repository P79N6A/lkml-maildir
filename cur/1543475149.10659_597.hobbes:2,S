For DNS it would be overkill I agree, but for other protocols (like Coda
which does bulk transfer over an UDP(?) based RPC protocol in userspace)
it could be useful. Also a system call is still much much cheaper than
sending and receiving an ARP packet, which also introduces "bubbles"
into long running data transfers.

Is this considered by the working groups?

My thinking was just that everything that is possible for a kernel protocol
should be possible for a user level protocol too - no unfair advantage
for the kernel ;)
