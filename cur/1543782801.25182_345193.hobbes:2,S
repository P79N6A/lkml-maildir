One way to clean this up would be to make rpaphp the driver for the
EADS bridges (from the pci code's point of view).  Then it would
automatically get included in the error recovery process and could do
whatever it should.

OK, so let's just add a new hotplug event called KOBJ_ERROR or
something, which tells userspace that an error has occurred which has
made the device inaccessible.  Greg, would that be OK?
The only trouble with that is that if we don't have a hotplug bridge
driver loaded for the slot, we can't tell the driver that its device
has gone away.  I guess that's not a big problem in practice.
Paul.
