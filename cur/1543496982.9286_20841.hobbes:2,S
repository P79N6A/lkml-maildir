Hi,
Linus, this patch looks as if it fixes a rather nasty
readahead/end-of-device bug lurking in the block read code.

That's perfectly OK.  bhe==bhb just means that we have processed the
entire readahead buffer already.  That buffer is a fixed length, so if
we request more data than will fit into it, we will still have non-zero
IO left at this point.
The problem only occurs if we go back round the loop with blocks==0.  In
that case, we'll not submit any new IO requests but will treat the
readahead list as if it were full, not empty.  Things go horribly wrong
at this point.
As far as I can tell, this can only occur if we truncated the requested
blocks count due to encountering the end of the device, but it does look
like a problem.

Your patch looks perfectly good.  We only get into difficulty if several
conditions are all met:
* last is non-zero: there is still space in the user buffer
* blocks is zero (we hit end-of-device)
* the readahead buffer has been emptied in this pass
In this case, we know for sure that there is nothing useful left to be
done: !blocks indicates no more IO left to submit, and (bhe == bhb)
indicates no more readahead buffer left to process.  If the patch you
suggest not only looks correct but also actually fixes the problem, then
I think we have a winner.
