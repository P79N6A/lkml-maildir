Very interesting -- I saw that nfsctl depended on certain values for i_ino,
but I didn't notice that it had reserved the first slot for NFSD_Root. The
only other caller of simple_fill_super that seems to depend on the inode
numbers is selinuxfs, and that one has this:
enum sel_inos {
         SEL_ROOT_INO = 2,
...so it looks like we can probably use 1 for the root inode (though we might
want to fix selinuxfs to set SEL_ROOT_INO = 1). I'll have a closer look to be
sure that this is all correct and respin this patch since that seems like it
would be less magic-number-y.
Thanks,
Jeff
