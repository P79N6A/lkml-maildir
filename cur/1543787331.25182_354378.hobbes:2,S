Subject: RocketPoint 1520 [hpt366] fails clock stabilization

Please CC me as I'm not on the list.
I just purchased a HighPoint Rocket 1520 SATA controller.  There seems
to be no libata driver (yet), but there is an ide driver, hpt366.  When
the driver gets loaded, it causes a kernel NULL pointer dereference in
pci_bus_clock_list.  It seems to be because the driver is waiting for
clock stabilization in init_hpt37x() which never comes.  The driver just
continues on with the pci drvdata set to NULL, instead of a valid clock
entry.  The following patch prevents the NULL dereference from
happening, but instead exit with an error.

I am using Gentoo linux with a gentoo patched kernel 2.6.12-r10.  The
dmesg of the driver attempting to attach is:

No Clock Stabilization!!!

I have seen a post from last year of someone with a similar problem.

Seems to be the same oops I was seeing.

NT is the path to the darkside.
