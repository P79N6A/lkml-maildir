I'm trying to redo our LML33 ( 
http://linuxmedialabs.com/lml33doc.html
 )
card driver and configuration scripts and have run into the following:
in the io.h file functions to read/write IO memory (writel(),readl()
etc.) are only defined with __KERNEL__ macro defined. Under 2.0.36 that
was not the case. 
I don't like setting __KERNEL__ for user space allications, besides it
produces a lot of errors when I try to compile. 
Q: what is the right way to access IO memory under 2.2.2 ?
Thank you for any help.
