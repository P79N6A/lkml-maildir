Hi,
 I am working on UNIX Network Programming (sockets programming in C). My 
problem is I do not know how to identify whether a process in Linux kernel has 
a socket. Because so many different processes in Linux kernel are running, a 
process forks many child processes and forms a process tree. I want to 
identify a process that has socket and saves state data about it. Then saves 
the same data about his parent process and walks up the process tree by 
repeating this procedure until a process with PID 0 is reached. But I do not 
know how to identify if a process has a socket.
