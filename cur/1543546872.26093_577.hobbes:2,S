That's why I wrote: " "exec" via a file system". But exec without
a real fs is a pointless feature-- if you have pthread_create and the code
in memory already, the only possible use of exec is to do something
with file type resources  and we just said we didn't have them.

Again, it's a possible, but pointless feature. You want fork/exec
in the presence of a file system and memory protection. But since
RTLinux has all that nice stuff available from Linux, there is little
point in duplicating it in the RT environment.
All that said, I reserve the right to add fork/exec to RTLinux sometime
if we see applications that really could make use of it. But my 
original point remains: the 1003.13 spec allow us to take a coherent
subset of POSIX that makes sense in the minimal RT environment.
