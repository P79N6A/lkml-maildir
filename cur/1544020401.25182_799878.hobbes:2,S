(...after some research...)
Best would probably be updating the Xorg evtouch-driver. It looks like someone 
already did this. I found a site containing a quite complete description of
(hopefully the same) problem: 
http://zalman.ostergaard.net/touch.html
However I don't think the changes were submitted upstream as the (new) driver 
does not contain support for the other eGalax-hardware anymore.
In my view the problem is not the Linux usbtouchscreen/usbhid driver, but the
evtouch-driver. It looks like the evtouch-driver is not maintained by the
Xorg-folks, but on 
http://www.conan.de/touchscreen/evtouch.html
 (contact
added in CC).
Anyone interested in creating a patch for evtouch?
