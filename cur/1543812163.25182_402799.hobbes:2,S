Hi,
In the 'scsi_cmnd' structure, there are two entries holding address
information for data to be transferred. One is 'request_buffer' and the
other one is 'buffer'.
In case of 'use_sg' is non-zero, those entries indicates the address of
the scatter-gather table.
Is there way to get virtual address (so that the data could be accessed
by the driver) of the actual data in the case of 'use_sg' is non-zero?
Any comments would be appreciated.
Thank you,
Seokmann
