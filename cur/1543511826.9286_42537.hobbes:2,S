This message was posted by me on linux-usb in response to David Waite's
concerns about my proposal for USB device allocation.  I'm sending to to
linux-kernel, since much of this discussion seems to be taking place on
both lists, and I don't think my proposal (and the subsequent
discussion) made it over there.

This response to David is quite long, but I hope people will take the time
to read it.  Please realize that I don't believe that this is a perfect
solution, but I believe it is pretty good (I think it's the best so far,
but then again, I'm biased).  I'm looking for anyone who wants to comment
on what they think of it.
Also, I'd really like comments to be directed at how this system falls
short compared to other proposed alternatives.  Sure, all proposals have
their problems.  But, with all these options on the table, I think we have
to start comparing them to _each_other_ to decide what's best.
Then again, if you think you have an idea that will work, jump in.  That's
what I did. :)
Here goes:

The point is that nobody will directly access usb0 unless they know what
they're doing.  People will generally use the symlink for the device.
Also, since the assignment will always roll upwards (like process IDs), if
usb0 is disconnected and a new device connected, the only way that the new
device will get usb0 is if _all_ other usb minor numbers are assigned.
That's a lot of devices, and one very paranoid case.  If you have 255
devices (254 attached at any one time), then you know you should be
careful.

Granted.  So what about a server system with 4 UW-SCSI cards, each of
which is full of devices?  The current allocation style for major/minor
numbers for SCSI drives limits us to 15 drives.  For any set of devices,
we can imagine a case where you have an absurd number of them.  I consider
4 USB controllers about as likely as 4 SCSI controllers.... and if that
happens, then manual intervention to assign another major number to USB
seems a reasonable alternative to this.

Perhaps.  But if it doesn't have a serial number, then either (a) it
doesn't need one (i.e. mice), or (b) we're going to have to fake it
anyway.  After all, if the information isn't there, then we're just not
going to be able to make a decision based on it.  Under almost any of the
proposals, a daemon will have to make some type of decision with available
information... I fail to see how this is a shortcoming of my proposal over
any other.

If we can have 254 devices, then either we have to bite the bullet and
pick several major numbers (2?), or use a dynamic filesystem.  But is the
trouble involved in using a dynamic filesystem justified in the face of
the extreme case of 254 USB devices attached to a system?  Just because
it's possible doesn't mean we have to go so far out of our way to allow
it.  Consider this: pick one major number to start with.  If the user
wants to support more than one major number worth of devices, then they
can recompile their kernel (or just the module) to designate another major
number to use.  If all USB ports draw from the same pool of minor numbers,
then this is still a good solution.
As for the lookup and open in one move.... That's the reason why the
assignment tries to avoid re-using designations for devices.  The race
condition here is the same one as using kill -9 on a pid.
Consider the following scenario, which I believe demonstrates how my
solution solves the race condition problem:
1) Computer running, 5 devices attached (usb[0-4])
2) Speakers, on usb0, are removed
3) A disk is inserted, and assigned usb5 (next in order, avoiding
    repetition)
3) A request for /dev/speaker, which is symlinked to usb0, is made
     _before_ the daemon can react to the removal and insertion event --
     note that /dev/speaker is still symlinked to usb0
4) The attempt to open fails, probably with a 'device unavailable'
     message, since /dev/usb0 no longer refers to any device on the system
5) The daemon catches up, removing /dev/speaker and configuring the disk.
The key points are as follows:
1) /dev/usb0 becomes invalid for _any_ operation as soon as the device is
     removed -- this is a kernel space activity
2) The other usb devices did not change their designation
3) When a new device was added, it choose the next available number for
     use, thus avoiding any confusion.  Again, confusion exists here only
     if you have exhausted the pool of minor numbers.  A driver
     modification to require us to always keep at least one minor number
     free (thus reducing our supported device count by 1) will remove this
     race condition at the expense of one device.  If we go with that
     idea, then we should probably spew messages all over syslog that tell
     us to allocate another major number for our USB devices.
This avoids race conditions, allows for easy operation of a user-space
daemon, and avoids dangerous confusion.  There is still one place where
confusion is still possible -- a device is added and access is attempted
before the daemon can catch up.  That's a pretty small time window.  In
that case, the symlink shouldn't exist, so the open will fail.
Again, the point is that nobody access the /dev/usb0 designation unless
they are a USB tool and the user knows what they are doing.  This is akin
to someone trying to get a file off of /dev/hda2 -- don't do it, go
through the mount point.
