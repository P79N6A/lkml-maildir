Because people want to know what it is really for ? It's quite amazing
really at the same time as people are posting crypto keys everywhere in
defiance of USSA law, we've got free software people trying to remove
references to a piece of out of tree software, and one that is free
software. 
And as I keep saying the tree is full of references to out of tree stuff.
The documentation directory alone currently contains over a thousand http
URLS as of 2.6.21-rc6-mm1.
