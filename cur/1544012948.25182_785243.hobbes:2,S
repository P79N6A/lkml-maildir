Since you didn't add the sig_task_unkillable() helper for its one simple
condition in patch 2/6, I don't think you need it here either for two.
Just add '&& !from_ancestor_ns' inline.
This patch has more stray whitespace changes.  
I think checkpatch.pl will spot those for you.
I'd just make the flag a parameter to send_signal() directly.
Then you can just change kill_pid_info_as_uid (or its replacement)
to call send_signal() with that new flag (and the 'group' flag) 
directly instead of using the trivial __group_send_sig_info wrapper.
Thanks,
Roland
