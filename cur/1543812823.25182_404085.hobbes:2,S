Bad? :-)  It would be bad only if they didn't *hide* the overflow device.
Regardless of the overflow device being hidden or not, that area is really
in use, and should be known to be in use.  How can you know it is in use if
the device is hidden, unless the BIOS reserves it?
Let's call that "inconvenient" BIOSes instead...
