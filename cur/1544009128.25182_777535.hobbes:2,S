Oh, I finally started looking more at this.
It's because the PCI layer uses the late resume for resuming. Which is 
horrid. It really shouldn't. Resuming your device after interrupts were 
enabled really sounds like a disaster. *Especially* if the device was 
active before, either because of hibernation or simply because firmware 
pre-initialized it to some "live" state (which could easily happen with 
ethernet in particular).
I do wonder why the PCI layer wants to resume things so late. It sounds 
totally insane to do things like resume the PCI bridge setup long *after* 
you have resumed other devices early. So by doing the default resume late, 
it just means that nobody can possibly use the early resume, and now 
everybody needs to resume everything with interrupts already going full 
blast.
IOW, the _sane_ thing would be to do something like the following patch 
does, namely:
 - if the driver has a suspend or suspend_early function, _only_ call that 
   (whether legacy or not)
 - otherwise, do the default suspend/resume late/early with interrupts 
   disabled.
which means that by default, we'll do all save-restore of the PCI state 
close to the actual CPU suspend event as possible.
Of course, hibernate probably depends on ->suspend() saving state, which 
it won't. Again, if thats' the case, then that's just hibernate (again) 
being totally fundamentally broken, and messing with STR functions. 
Rafael?
I have neither tested the patch nor even tried to compile it - it's meant 
to be an example and get people thinking about this, rather than anything 
else.
