What exactly is the pita here? Al only came up with some rather 
theoretical problems with no practical relevance.

In simple cases gcc can optimize this away, additionally it's offset by 
one less memory reference in the timer code, so the code executed per 
timer would be equal or often even less. Additionally less code is needed 
to initialize the timer.

I don't. The current API is maybe not perfect, but changing the API for no 
practical benefit would be an even bigger pita. I'd rather keep it as is.
