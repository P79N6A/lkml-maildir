Well why didn't you guys mention this when mmiowb() went in?
I agree that having a relaxed PIO ordering version of writeX makes sense 
(jejb convinced me of this on irc the other day).  But what to name it?  
We already have readX_relaxed, but that's for PIO vs. DMA ordering, not 
PIO vs. PIO.  To distinguish from that case maybe writeX_weak or 
writeX_nobarrier would make sense?
