Damn, I was wondering how long it would take until someone would come up 
with a compromise solution ; ) Compromises everywhere will lead to 
nowhere, I've learned that the hard way. But this is really not a major 
issue, so let's not make a showstopper out of this one and the likes.
For what I know about the whole inclusion discussion until now, there's 
been a whole lot of flamewar chickenshit so far. Considering that I have 
no FS developing abilities whatsoever, I'm pretty pissed at people who 
do know better in their field and should know better than waste their 
time on discussions other than constructive ones.
Get the personal bullshit out of the way, everyone, please! Get in touch 
and work out your differences in a productive manner. If every 
interesting yet at first intrusive extension to the kernel causes as 
much kindergarten as this one, where will we end up? Stagnation sucks, 
yet good progress is sometimes slow-paced...
Peace, everyone!
