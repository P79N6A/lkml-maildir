You're right, I didn't know about that one.  Thanks for the
education and for taking the time to respond.
I wonder whether it is feasible to run with allow_exec{heap,mem,mod,stack}
all set to false, on a real system.  Is there any example of a fully
worked out SELinux policy that has these set to false?  FC5 has
allow_execheap set to false and all others set to true in its default
SELinux policy, so it looks like the mmap(PROT_EXEC, MAP_ANONYMOUS)
loophole remains open in FC5 by default.  My concern would be that setting
all of the exec-related booleans to false might break so much code that
setting them all to false wouldn't be feasible in practice.  If so,
the theoretical possibility to close the mmap(PROT_EXEC, MAP_ANONYMOUS)
loophole may be one of these things that is possible in theory but not
in practice.
