i've released the -T0 VP patch:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/voluntary-preempt/voluntary-preempt-2.6.9-rc3-mm2-T0
Changes since -T0:
 - fix preempt-timing facility (reported by Florian Schmidt)
 - fix !4K stack compilation breakage (reported by Lee Revell)
 - revert experimental scheduler stuff from -mm. (Rui, does this fix your 
   problems?)
note that sw-suspend and x64+LATENCY_TRACE is still broken.
