i dont see how yours is more efficient when it always runs echo.  nor does it 
give the same behavior ... your propposed change will echo blank lines in the 
silent mode which is incorrect.  it also does not seem to follow the standard 
convention of other kconfig commands that have quiet/silent prefixes ... such 
commands do not define arguments to an unknown program/function, nor do they 
add arbitrary redirection which gets leads to confusion as to final 
expansion, they define the entire command.
what Sam posted (and what was merged) makes sense to me.
