Which basically calls block_dev.c:do_open() and the module count there is
only incremented if get_blkfops() is successfull, which is a dummy in this
case. So where again is the module count incremented?

You never answered my question, why you insist on managing the ops
pointer. The far easier fix would be to simply remove this nonsense.
