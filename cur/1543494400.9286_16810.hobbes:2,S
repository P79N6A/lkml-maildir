Hi,
I have a DVD-RAM drive. This device tells the SCSI layers that it's a
CDROM drive. This allows me to do CDROM-stuff with it. 
However I would like to write to the device, as 2.5G of removeable
writable disk space is not insignificant.... ;-)
The trick that I grabbed off the net was to "ghost" the drive
into a MO-device and a "cdrom drive". This way I seem to be able 
to write and to use it as a CDROM. 
In the mean while I found that a certain toshiba CDROM drive was
misbehaving, and that we currently have a "special feature list" for
that kind of stuff. 
I appreciate feedback, so go ahead.... (I'm sorry that I haven't
upgraded to 2.2.6 yet, if it doesn't patch into 2.2.6, please tell
me.)
			Roger Wolff.
