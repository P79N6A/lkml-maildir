I've done that a few times before, but then I always forget to
set the CFLAGS each time I build the kernel (or do the modules,
etc.).  I really don't mind tweaking the Makefiles for builds,
but it just doesn't seem beneficial to keep -m486 around when
I don't think it's helping anyone at all (for Pentium or Pentium
Pro), but it might be hurting a large number of those with
recent compilers.
Just a defaults thing, really.
