this hang here.  Things to check:
1) what it complained about when doing the 'make install' of the userspace.
2) What /var/log/XFree86.log (or wherever your X server output goes) says - it's
usually pretty good about logging what it's upset about.
3) Make sure you have a sane setting for "Option NvAGP" in your XF86Config that
matches what your kernel has.  It's documented in Appendix D of the README....
