Sorry, of course.
[as Mitch has already pointed out privately] e.g the XFree86 DRM radeon 
Makefile includes this:
[xc/programs/Xserver/hw/xfree86/os-support/linux/drm/kernel/Makefile.linux]
	# Check for 4-argument vmap() in some 2.5.x and 2.4.x kernels
	VMAP := $(shell grep -A1 'vmap.*count,$$' 
$(LINUXDIR)/include/linux/vmalloc.h | grep -c prot)
	ifneq ($(VMAP),0)
	EXTRA_CFLAGS += -DVMAP_4_ARGS
	endif
Christoph's vmap() backport introduced this reference in 
linux/vmalloc.h, so the DRM module is now compiled with VMAP_4_ARGS defined.
The radeon kernel driver source includes (via drm_memory.h) 
linux/vmalloc.h, iff VMAP_4_ARGS is defined. The latter includes (on 
i386) asm/asm-i386/pgtable.h, which includes asm/asm-i386/processor.h.
processor.h defines some inline functions [set_in_cr4() & 
clear_in_cr4()] which reference mmu_cr4_features.
mmu_cr4_features is currently declared in arch/i386/kernel/setup.c [and 
also arch/x86_64/kernel/setup.c] but not currently exported.
[The problem is not restricted to the radeon kernel driver; I've just 
used it as an example]
cheers,
Calum.
