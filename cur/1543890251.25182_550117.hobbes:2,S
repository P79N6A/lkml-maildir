Yes, indeed.

I'm not sure waiting will help. The roasted pigeons will not come
flying into your mouth.
The possible solutions have been sketched out for you:
a) open the device file from the kernel (described by Jan):
   actively discouraged by the kernelnewbies.org FAQ document,
   and probably won't even work IMHO
b) program the serial port directly (described by Jan):
   will work only with one type of hardware and you'll have to
   disable the regular serial driver first; frowned upon by kernel
   gurus as "reinventing the wheel"
c) abuse the line discipline interface (described by me):
   moderately well documented, and there's precedent for using it
   that way in the well-accepted PPP module as well as my humble
   contribution, the ser_gigaset driver; requires a userspace
   daemon for pushing the line discipline module on the serial
   port and keeping it there
d) use the serio interface (described by Ying Huang):
   potentially cleaner conceptually and seems to work without a
   userspace daemon, but apparently not documented anywhere
   except in the source files drivers/input/serio/serport.c
   and linux/drivers/input/mouse/sermouse.c
Now it's your turn to decide.
