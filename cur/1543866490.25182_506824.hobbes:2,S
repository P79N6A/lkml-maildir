Subject: introducing conditional submenus in the config process?

  i brought this up a while back but nothing was finalized -- is there
sufficient value in being able to select or deselect entire submenus
of features without having to descend into that submenu first?
  as a random example, consider Device Drivers --> MTD support.  as it
stands, i can select or deselect MTD support in its entirety only by
first going into the MTD submenu.  i mentioned before that it would be
far more convenient to have the selection switch on that upper-level
menu entry instead, which you can get with a patch like this:

=====================================================
  so the higher level config feature changes from a "config" to a
"menuconfig", then the entire submenu is wrapped in the appropriate
conditional.  this sort of thing could be used in all kinds of places
in the current Kconfig structure to avoid constantly visiting
submenus.
  (as an aside, rather than have to implement this with two Kconfig
features, it might even be worth creating a whole new feature,
something like "submenuconfig" or whatever, that does all this
automatically.)
  thoughts?
