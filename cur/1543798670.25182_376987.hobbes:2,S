Actually, Jim, I doubt it.  There is one more race which cannot be 
solved with the existing interfaces.  I want to tackle this next, after 
these changes are decided on.
The problem is directory creation and then populating it.  As in cp -r 
and any backup tool.  You currently have to use (at best)
    mkdirat(fd, "some-dir", 0666);
    dfd = openat(fd, "some-dir", O_RDONLY);
What is needed is a way to create a new directory and return a file 
descriptor for it.
I was thinking about using
dfd = openat(fd, "some-dir", O_RDONLY|O_DIRECTORY|O_CREAT, S_IFDIR|0666)
where the combination of using O_DIRECTORY, O_RDONLY, O_CREAT, and the 
S_IFDIR flag can be recognized.  This is a configuration which cannot be 
used successfully in current code.  Should probably also work with open().
