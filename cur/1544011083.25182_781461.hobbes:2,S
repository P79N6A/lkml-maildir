Sure.  Ingo has a script for gathering info (attached), if you run it,
please gzip up the output and send me a copy offline to eyeball.
There's also ftrace, but I've not tried that yet, so can't offer any
advice, I use primitive but effective time_after() + printk() with klogd
wakeup disabled (deadlock).
