OK, I found you disabled CONFIG_MD, which means neither
dm.ko nor md.ko was built.
Do you have any out-of-tree kernel modules which call either
bd_claim_by_kobject or bd_claim_by_disk?
If you aren't using either of them, I'm afraid reverting
the patch doesn't really solve your problem because the patched
code is called only from them.
