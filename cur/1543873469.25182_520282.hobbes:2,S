Ya got me, but according to my debug logs, what's causing my lockup is
the reference we add while making the symlink when we hit...
 if (driver_name) in module_add_driver().  Maybe we go through there
twice, once with a name, and once without?  Dunno.

I don't know about _correctly_, but my diag patch _boots_, as does your
patch plus my addon diag bits.

Well, I will never see that, because ipmi_si finds no interfaces, so
always backs out.  After backout, with my patch and yours + my addons, I
have there leftovers.
