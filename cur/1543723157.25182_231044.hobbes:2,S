2.4.21-pre1 is the first non-working kernel, 2.4.20 works. When generating the 
configs for 2.4.21-pre1 (make oldconfig based on the working 2.4.20 config) I 
was asked "Use IDE Taskfile I/O" which defaulted to no and I kept that 
default (i.e. "Don't use Taskfile I/O").
lspci -s 07.1 -xxx shows no difference between a working (2.4.20) kernel and a 
non-working (2.4.21-pre1) kernel.
This caught my eye, but was probably obvious to you:
2.4.21-pre1 reports IDE Version 7.00beta-2.4 while 2.4.20 reports version 6.31
