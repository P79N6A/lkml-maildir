This is taking longer than expected. Removing the old latency tracer has
caused a bit to be broken. The latency tracer has been in the RT kernel
for so long that it has hooks in lots of unrelated patches. It's taking a
bit of surgury to remove all the bits without killing the rest.
I will not be working on this over the weekend. I'll start back up on
Monday.
