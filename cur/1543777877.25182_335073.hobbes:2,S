No its not compiling for me.
I'm currently building drivers for the DELL DKMS kit.
Trying to add support for SLES9 SP2 support ( -191 kernel).
My driver compiles for SLES9 Base(-97) and SP2(-139) but fails for SP2.
Between SP1 and SP2, they added msleep.
Here is the make.log output that you will find in 
/var/lib/dkms/mptlinux/3.02.52/build
when it fails to compile.
Also attached is linux_compat.h with the changes you have suggested.
