What you call `legacy space' above is called `PCI I/O space'.
What you call `PCI IO space' above is CPU address (memory) space.

Like Dave already said:

PCI has I/O space and memory space (and config space).
On ia32, you access PCI I/O space (`I/O ports') using IN/OUT instructions.
On non-ia32, you access PCI I/O space by accessing a special region of the CPU
address space.
You access PCI memory space by accessing a special region of the CPU
address space on all platforms I'm aware of. On ia32, it starts at CPU address
zero, and there's no offset between CPU physical addresses and PCI bus
addresses. On other platforms, there may be offsets.
The first (first in PCI bus space!) 16 MiB of PCI memory space is special in
that it's ISA memory space. On ia32, it's always at CPU address zero. On other
platforms, it may be at offset zero of PCI memory space, or it may be in a
completely different region of CPU address space. Or it may not be accessible
at all (cfr. some PowerMacs).
For access to PCI config space, there are even more possibilities. On ia32 it's
usually done using indirect access to PCI I/O space 0xcf8 etc. On other
platforms it's usually done by accessing a special region of the CPU address
space. Or in a different way ;-)

when I'm talking to journalists I just say "programmer" or something like that.
