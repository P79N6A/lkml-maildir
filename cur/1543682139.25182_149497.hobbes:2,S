Is this true?  Do irq handlers _always_ run with interrupts enabled?
I thought the driver could control this behavior with the SA_INTERRUPT
flag.
This code in handle_IRQ_event seems to turn interrupts back on
(apparently someone has turned them off), but only if SA_INTERRUPT is
not set.
   if (!(action->flags & SA_INTERRUPT))
                 __sti();
