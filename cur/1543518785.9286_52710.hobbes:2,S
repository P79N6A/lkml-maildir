Thats not just implausible its impossible. There are only 24 address wires
on an ISA bus. It sounds like the ISA bus DMA is being remapped by your
chipset to a 16Mb window somewhere intelligent. If your board is mapping
the ISA bus to the low 16Mb of RAM thats good.

Actually it doesnt work for many IDE controllers, it doesnt work for a lot
of older sound cards let alone new ones.

Right now we just use the 24bit DMA space. Its good enough for the moment.
Post 2.4 we may want to think harder about the disk controller aspects.
