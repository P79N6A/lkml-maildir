David,
 maybe they are not :-)
 After some more playing with printk-s and a bit of gross hacking I
think I am up to something.
 Please look at the appended patch on top of 2.4.22. It adds some
printk-s and also makes some of the V2 pathes trigger by adding "1 ||"
to some statemens.
 With this all of a sudden the external packets to the 239.2.11.71
group of Ganglia come in again.
 Now, what does it mean?
a) IGMP_V2_SEEN does not work as expected ?
b) something with the timer codes is fishy ?
c) whatever ...
 Again, hope this helps to shed light on the problem.
Martin
