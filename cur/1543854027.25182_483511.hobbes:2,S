Perhaps a better approach to the initialization problem would be to assume 
that either:
    1.  The srcu_struct will be initialized before it is used, or
    2.  When it is used before initialization, the system is running
	only one thread.
In other words, statically allocated SRCU strucures that get used during
system startup must be initialized before the system starts multitasking.  
That seems like a reasonable requirement.
This eliminates worries about readers holding mutexes.  It doesn't 
solve the issues surrounding your hardluckref, but maybe it makes them 
easier to think about.
