Ram, can you clarify the status of this patch please?
I ran the same sysbench test on my hardware with patched 2.6.6 and got 
122.2348s execution time, i.e. almost the same results as in the original 
tests. Is this patch an intermediate step to improve the sysbench workload on 
2.6, or it just addresses another problem?
