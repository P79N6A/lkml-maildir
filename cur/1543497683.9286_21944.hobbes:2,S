Alan,
	I still think this problem is caused by programming the registers
wrong.  It
seems strange that 22050 and 44100 are slow and 11025 is fast. It implies
that the
sample rate isn't changing, but signals with different recorded rates are
played out
at the same rate.  Without having access to the datasheets, I would guess
this chip
is similar but not close enough to the ES1688.  Are there any boards working
that
can shoot this theory down?
