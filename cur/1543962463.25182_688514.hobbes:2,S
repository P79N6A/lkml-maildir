The thing I'd like to see is:
 - a more recent description of file system layout
   I've read the original paper, and I assume things have changed when 
   implementing stuff. They always do.
 - some benchmarks and/or comments about regular usage (ie fragmentation 
   etc). Yeah, it doesn't need to be all that extensive, but quite 
   frankly, it sounds like this is meant to be at least a partial 
   replacement for a GP filesystem (considering that seek/rotational 
   delay are going away) and people are working on it with USB memory 
   sticks etc, wouldn't it make sense to talk about disk usage (how much 
   the GC wants free etc) and everyday performance?
Hmm?
