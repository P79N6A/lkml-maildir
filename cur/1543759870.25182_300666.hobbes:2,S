Thanks for the patch. Yes, it does fix switching between X and VT. As for 
colours / graphics, disabling CONFIG_FB_PM2_FIFO_DISCONNECT fixes that 
too, but it worked under 2.6.10-rc2 with that option on too. What does it 
do and why I cannot use it under 2.6.11 any more? The help text to this 
option is not very enlightening...
Thanks
