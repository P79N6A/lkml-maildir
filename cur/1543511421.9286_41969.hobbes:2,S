The fact that it's only adding elements is just too much to be safe.
We are walking a list that can change under us.
If you want to make the algorithm SMP safe then you should insert the
proper mb()/wmb()/rmb() calls both in dev_clear_backlog and in
skb_queue_tail.
Suppose you have this queue:
	--> head -> elem1 -> elem2 --
	|		            |
	-----------------------------
Suppose you want to add the newsk to the end of queue as netif_rx does.
Suppose dev_clear_backlog is walking the queue on the other CPU while it
see the memory this way:
	head -> elem -> elem -> newsk -> NULL
As you are not doing ordered read in dev_clear_backlog and ordered writes
in skb_queue_tail you have no garantee you won't find the list corrupted.
Actually skb_queue_tail don't even enforce ordering at the assembler
level.
The effect of skb_queue_tail() could be reordered this way due memory
speculative operations in SMP.
This is the core of the stock skb_queue_tail.
{
        struct sk_buff *prev, *next;
        newsk->list = list;
        list->qlen++;
        next = (struct sk_buff *)list;
        prev = next->prev;
        newsk->next = next;
        newsk->prev = prev;
        next->prev = newsk;
        prev->next = newsk;
}
It may be easily reodered or at the assembler level or at the CPU level
this way:
extern __inline__ void __skb_queue_tail(struct sk_buff_head *list, struct sk_buf
{
        struct sk_buff *prev, *next;
        newsk->list = list;
        list->qlen++;
        next = (struct sk_buff *)list;
        prev = next->prev;
        next->prev = newsk;
        prev->next = newsk;
	/* HERE dev_clear_backlog is reading the last entry of the list
	   that is newsk and then he is reading newsk->next before we have
	   a chance to update newsk->next to fix the queue
	   and so it will Oops (if newsk was not weird, if it was weird
	   you'll have some more fun). */
        newsk->next = next;
        newsk->prev = prev;
}
