Indeed.  But quite functional.  Have you guys been doing i386 as well?
This kind of thing was needed to convince gdb when it really was time to
stop trying unwind in a few cases, but looks quite bad on x86_64/i386.
Thankfully getting it to stop on ARM was pretty easy (but it wasn't
full/true annotations).
