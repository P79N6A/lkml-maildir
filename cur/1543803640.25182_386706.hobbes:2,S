It might not be, I'm totally acpi clueless :-)
But the code factoring should look something like this:
- Lookup taskfiles needed for resume (and suspend might need some,
  too?). This step requires looking for sata and pata taskfiles listed,
  so you'd need code for both.
- Submit and check status of said taskfiles. This step is independent of
  the drive type.
So step 1 is the one that needs extending, how much work that is I
dunno since I have no clue on the actual lookup or the acpi data.
