Diff between 2.2.20pre9aa1 and 2.2.20pre9aa2:
Only in 2.2.20pre9aa1: 00_poll-nfds-1
Only in 2.2.20pre9aa2: 00_poll-nfds-2
	Fixed off by one error in the rlimit check.

Only in 2.2.20pre9aa2: 40_lfs-2.2.20pre9aa2-27.bz2
	Drop obsolete (and duplicated) fcntl64 definition in the sparc
	unistd.h. (this was a lonstanding bug, it never triggered yet because
	glibc gets compiled with the 2.4 headers)
