Maybe. The fact that the error is noticed indicates that the memory has at
least parity capability. However, current memory with has "by 72" width
instead of "by 64" can also do EDAC, in which case all one bit errors will
be corrected. Some motherboards can be configured to NMI on parity, even
if corrected. I had one, back when PPro was hot stuff.
So it's just possible that the data is fine in spite of the NMI. That
said, I'd start looking for a hardware problem regardless, even if it's
currently working, it's not working *right*.
