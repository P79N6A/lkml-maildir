That's not what I was doing. I was saying that Rafael could, if he
wanted, at least look at how Suspend2 has done it and use that (if he
thinks its helpful) as a basis for improving or whatever. If he does
essentially the same thing for swsusp, he could again look at suspend2
loops etc to help in double checking his algorithm and so on.
