Right hand side is evaluated when encountered.
Often what you want. So for example
CC := cc
here CC is assigned the value cc when seen.
=
Right hand side is evaluated only when left hand side is used.
Also very usefull. Example just mocked up:
cmd_vdso32_cc = $(CC) -T $^ -o $@
Doing late evaluation will cause correct replacement of $^ and $@ when
used. When cmd_vdso_32 is defined make does not know the desired values
for $^ and $@ - this is only known when cmd_vdso_32 is actually used.
Hope this clarifies it.
