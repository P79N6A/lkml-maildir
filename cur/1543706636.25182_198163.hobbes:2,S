Please don't break the CC list on replies.
I'm not sure whether it's valid UTF-8 or not, but it's certainly
possible to code, for example, an 'A', (decimal 65), via an escape to
a 31-bit character representation.  Presumably the majority of UTF-8
parsers would decode the sequence as 65, rather than emit an error.
Also, even ignoring that, how do you handle things like accented
characters which can be represented as single characters, or as
sequences containing combining characters?  Some applications might
convert the sequence containing combining characters in to the single
character, and others might not.
John.
