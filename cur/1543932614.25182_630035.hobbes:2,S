Subject: [PATCH] Allow Kconfig to set default mmap_min_addr protection
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/12/19/239

Since it was decided that low memory protection from userspace couldn't
be turned on by default add a Kconfig option to allow users/distros to
set a default at compile time.  This value is still tunable after boot
in /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr

+	  This is the portion of low virtual memory which should be protected
+	  from userspace allocation.  Keeping a user from writing to low pages
+	  can help reduce the impact of kernel NULL pointer bugs.
+
+	  For most users with lots of address space a value of 65536 is
+	  reasonable and should cause no problems.  Programs which use vm86
+	  functionality would either need additional permissions from either
+	  the LSM or the capabilities module or have this protection disabled.
+
+	  This value can be changed after boot using the
+	  /proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr tunable.
