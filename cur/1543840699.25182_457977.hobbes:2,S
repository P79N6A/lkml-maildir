Cpuset updaters are rare, but they are not -that- rare.
And the cpuset file system allows one to configure some
cpusets to be modifiable by any end user.
One would not want such an end user to be able to stop
the machine at will by manipulating the cpusets they
are allowed to modify.
Nor would one want the cpuset actions done by say a
batch scheduler during one jobs setup to bring all the
other presently active jobs to a grinding halt.
So perhaps taking CPUs offline merits a stop_machine().
But I've little desire to stop_machine() when modifying
cpusets.
