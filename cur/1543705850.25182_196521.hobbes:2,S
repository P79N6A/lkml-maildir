Yep, the first part (overwritting mounted media) is pointless, the
second IS NOT.

Is it realy a hardware issue? We have a very similar bug in the Debian
BTS (ping-pong issue between kernel and cdrtools maintainers). The
problem there is: 
 you have a session
 you umount the iso9660 there
 you write a second session
 you mount the media without ejecting it
 AND you see the OLD filesystem. And it is large, IMHO this does NOT
 come from the cache. I think there is an ugly bug in kernel's CDROM
 TOC/session management, it caches the TOC data and does not invalidate
 it on mount calls.

Oh, and it is very simple to shout on anyone "Just eject and reload,
there is no issue, everything pointless".
This sucks. It is not a solution, it is a an admited failure. In
most notebooks, the media cannot be reloaded, and in normal PC boxes
with closed front door, you always risk mechanical damage if the door is
closed and you did not notice it.

Eduard.
