The page will be in memory until the transaction has finished.  The
transaction won't finish until it has been moved from the journal to its
final location on disk.
Once that has happened the page can be freed.  Now, if the page is
invalidated in the middle of the transaction, all future accesses will come
from memory until that page is flushed, or cleaned.
IIUC, ext3 never reads from the journal (unless you're doing a recovery).
The journal just shows on disk what is already in memory so it can be
recovered after an abnormal shutdown.
