Mine has problems as well.  I know there are workarounds, but I'm not
experienced enough to do these.  Joe: what error messages do you get?  I get
the "hde: timeout waiting for dma" errors.  After that I have to cold start
my PC to get it working.  BTW, I have a PDC20265, but I think these are
probably almost identical (or at least the behaviour we are getting is
probably due to the same problem in the code).
I also suspect that maybe what kind of hard drive you have makes a
difference as well, because some people can get their Promise IDE to work
fine, while others can't.  I have a Quantum Fireball Plus AS.
In case you didn't know, Andre Hedrick met with some dude from Promise
called Craig Lyons on Wednesday.  I haven't heard of any news from the
meeting, but supposedly Craig was going to give Andre some API for the
Ultra/Fastrack line of chips.  Hopefully it went down on Wednesday.
