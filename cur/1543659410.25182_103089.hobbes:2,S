The option window will likely get a back button.
How the option window works might not be obvious, but I don't think it's
that difficult to find out how it works, but I'm always open to
suggestion to improve this.

The problem here is that the Kconfig files weren't directly written for
the new config tool, so it has to make the best out of it. There is of
course enough room for improvement.

A patch to make this possible is available, but it needs a bit more
work.

Have you found the full tree mode?
I'm thinking about the option to open a submbenu in its own window, but
it will not be the default. I really hate it when a program thinks it
has to open a new window for everything.

Offering too many options at once is not good either, as then you have
the choice that you must expand lots of submenus until you find, what
you need or you have a huge list of options. The current window is a
compromise, which doesn't show too much and already has everything
expanded. If possible I would omit the +/- icons, but it's not possible
without reimplementing the whole widget.
