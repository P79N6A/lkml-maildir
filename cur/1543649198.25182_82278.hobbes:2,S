The original thread was started by Tom Gall and went through several
incarnations:
Subject: New BK License Problem?
Subject: BK MetaData License Problem?
Subject: BK is *evil* corporate software
Subject: Off topic, bandwidth wasting, waffle about Bit Keeper
Subject: BK license questions and answers
Subject: Bitkeeper outrage, old and new
So everyone else who changed the subject will be blacklisted too?
bye, Roman
