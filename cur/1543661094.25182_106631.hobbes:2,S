The original message said:
---------------------------------------------------------
[BUG] what if the for loop above ends with i = 0?
/home/yxie/linux-2.5.53/sound/oss/sb_card.c:890:sb_isapnp_probe:
ERROR:BUFFER:890:890:Array bounds error (off < 0) (sb_isapnp_list[i],
max(off) = -1) 
}
if(!first || !reverse)
i = isapnpjump;
first = 0;
Error --->
while(sb_isapnp_list[i].card_vendor != 0) {
static struct pci_bus *bus = NULL;
while ((bus = isapnp_find_card(
---------------------------------------------------------
(Hopefully) Relevant loop:
    /* Count entries in sb_isapnp_list */
    for (i = 0; sb_isapnp_list[i].card_vendor != 0; i++);
    i--;
The loop will never end with i=0 unless the card list is
empty. And what use would a driver with an empty card list be? (so that
will never happen. Maybee the checker won't trigger if the cardlist is
marked as "const"? I vote for this to be marked as a non-bug, but
someone else should probably check it too.)
