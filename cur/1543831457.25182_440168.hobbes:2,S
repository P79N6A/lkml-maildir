Yes, this driver is already split into 2 different ones (look in the
recent -mm releases).  Sierra wants to have their devices be in their
own driver, as the chip is a little different from the other ones.  This
means that those devices are now controlled by a driver called "sierra"
and the other devices still are working with the airprime driver.
This should hopefully fix the different endpoint issue, and allow new
devices to be supported properly, as Sierra Wireless is now maintaining
that driver.
Hope this helps,
