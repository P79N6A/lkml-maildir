No errors at all? No "Transmitter underrun" (at debug>1)? I suspect you hit
two more bugs: If the driver resets the chip (e.g. watchdog timeout),
chances are the chip is programmed to go half-duplex -> performance breaks
down. No problem as long as we deal with errors properly, but the Rhine-II
can throw an error the mainline driver doesn't notice because the interrupt
status registers stay clean.
Can I see a complete log (at debug=3), starting with module insertion?
There's got to be some underrun and watchdog timeout.

Define "trashed". How exactly did it misbehave, what did you have to do to
get it back working? Anything interesting in the log before it breaks?
FWIW, it is possible to get a Rhine into a state where physically removing
the PCI card from the computer and keeping both away from any power source
for an hour still results in the driver hanging on boot (after putting
everything back together, of course). I've gone through this twice so far.
Voodoo magic.
