Resume works on the Dell XPS with the Ubuntu Edgy release
Ubuntu-2.6.17-10.25 (2.6.17 plus a zillion fixes). Ubuntu's git tree is
rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bcollins/ubuntu-2.6.git.
Ubuntu-2.6.17-8.21 is the first version where resume works, but there
are a boatload of changes in ACPI and SW suspend between that and the
previous tag Ubuntu-2.6.17-7.20. I don't know what made SW suspend work,
but even knowing that won't tell me what broke it again.
I've been avoiding the bisect process because it is quite time consuming
on my slow machine, there is much branch weirdness, and I'm not that
good with git. I thought if I narrowed the failure down to a small chunk
of code in 2.6.21-rc3, then the answer might be obvious. No such luck, huh?
This crash behaves like the video memory space has become unmapped. Is
that possible?
