Here are my settings.  Hopefully it will be clear what I'm
talking about..yell if you need details.  Please note that I explicitly
set the send buffers to 128k and the rcv to 16k in my test so the min and max
socket queue lengths do not matter here.
my $dflt_tx_queue_len = 2000;   # Ethernet driver transmit-queue length.  Might be worth making
                                 # it bigger for GigE nics.
my $netdev_max_backlog = 5000; # Maximum number of packets, queued on the INPUT side, when
                                # the interface receives pkts faster than it can process them.
my $wmem_max = 4096000;  # Write memory buffer.  This is probably fine for any setup,
                          # and could be smaller (256000) for < 5Mbps connections.
my $wmem_default = 128000;  # Write memory buffer.  This is probably fine for any setup,
                             # and could be smaller (256000) for < 5Mbps connections.
my $rmem_max = 8096000;  # Receive memory (packet) buffer.  If you are running
                          # lots of very fast traffic,
                          # you may want to make this larger if you are running over
                          # fast, high-latency networks.
                          # For < 5Mbps of traffic, 512000 should be fine.
my $rmem_default = 128000;  # Receive memory (packet) buffer.
# If this is not 1, then the tcp_* settings below will not be applied.
my $modify_tcp_settings = 1;
# See the kernel documentation: Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt
my $tcp_rmem_min     = 4096;
my $tcp_rmem_default = 256000;  # TCP specific receive memory pool size.
my $tcp_rmem_max     = 30000000;  # TCP specific receive memory pool size.
my $tcp_wmem_min     = 4096;
my $tcp_wmem_default = 256000;  # TCP specific write memory pool size.
my $tcp_wmem_max     = 30000000;  # TCP specific write memory pool size.
my $tcp_mem_lo       = 20000000; # Below here there is no memory pressure.
my $tcp_mem_pressure = 30000000; # Can use up to 30MB for TCP buffers.
my $tcp_mem_high     = 60000000; # Can use up to 60MB for TCP buffers.

Disk-IO uses buffers, so a change here could easily starve the rest
of your system.  I'm just saying I can't reliably test this.  To be honest,
my machines are already throwing allocation failures in the ethernet drivers
and I've had the OOM killer kill my main process several times.  So, my machines
are running right at their memory limit, even w/out any disk IO.

But, you could get unlucky and have 3000 people on a shitty dialup
connection connect to you.  That does not make it easy to reliably
test the system.

So, maybe a VM problem?  That would be a good place to focus since
I think we can be fairly certain it isn't a problem in just the
networking code.  Otherwise, my tests would show lower bandwidth.
