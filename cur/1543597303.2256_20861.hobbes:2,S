There is just the call to vfs_mknod in net/unix/af_unix.c that I
mentioned.  I'm not sure what to do about that one.
A
    find -name '*.[ch]' | xargs egrep 'vfs_(mkdir|mknod|create)'
found:
  4 matches in fs/nfsd/vfs.c       which I explicitly didn't want to change
  6 matches in fs/devfs/base.c     which were really matches for devfs_(mkdir|mknod)
  7 matches in fs/namei.c          which the patch changed
  3 matches in kernel/ksyms.c      which are EXPORT_SYMBOLs, not calls
  3 matches in include/linux/fs.h  which are declatations
  2 matches in net/unix/af_unix.c  one is a comment, the other is the
                                   one in question
To be maximally conservative, you might want to apply this patch,
just in case it is important.
