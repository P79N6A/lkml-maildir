I got a Dell powerEdge something with 4G of memory locking up pritty
hard when Danial Phillips test program hits chunk 9:
mlocking at 401bf000 of size 1048576
mlock took 12.181794 seconds
munlock'ed 5999e000
munmap'ed 5999e000
Loading data at 5999e000 for slot 1
Load (/mnt/sdb/sven/chunk9) succeeded!
mlocking slot 1, 5999e000
mlocking at 5999e000 of size 1048576
And nothing.  It's a vanilla 2.4.13 kernel and Mandrake 8.0.
If I run the program up to like chunk 3 and send an interrupt it
doesn't free up the memory unless I umount the file system.
Please suggest idea on how to fix it.  I have this system to abuse for
several days.
