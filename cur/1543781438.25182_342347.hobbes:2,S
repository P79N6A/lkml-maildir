i have released the 2.6.13-rc6-rt3 tree, which can be downloaded from 
the usual place:
  
http://redhat.com/~mingo/realtime-preempt/
Changes since 2.6.13-rc6-rt2:
 - reverted an incorrect tasklist_lock -> lock_task() conversion that 
   slipped in via an earlier hack in the HRT code. The issue it tried to 
   solve is mooted by the RCU-tasklist-lock code.
 - introduce mutex_chprio() as the mechanism for High Resolution timers 
   to dynamically change the priority of the HRT softirq thread. [This
   fixes a latency/priority bug in where the dynamic prio would override 
   the inherited priority, and when the PI mechanism restores priority 
   it would override the HRT priority.]
 - now that HR-timer dynamic priorities have the proper framework, 
   removed the HIGH_RES_TIMERS_DYN_PRIO config option and made the 
   feature unconditional.
to build a 2.6.13-rc6-rt3 tree, the following patches should be applied:
