   The problem is signed/unsigned conversion. The "len" arg to
   ptrace_writedata is signed int, so as a user I set it to -1. The
   length check only checks for exceeding the buffer size; -1 passes
   the check.  When we pass -1 to copy_from_user, it is converted to
   unsigned, i.e. ~4Gb ;-)
Thanks, these two functions need to be extern declared in a header
file too, I'll submit fixes for both problems to Linus.
Later,
