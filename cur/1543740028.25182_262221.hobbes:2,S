E.g. when passing data into a UML kernel, it's handy if you can
use parts of the host environment, such as PATH or cwd, even if
the user has a somewhat strange setup, with spaces in them.
That would be for things like "run this test script from my
PATH, using files in the current directory, as 'init' under that
kernel".
