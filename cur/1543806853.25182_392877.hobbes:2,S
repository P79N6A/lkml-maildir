SATA will _not_ look like SCSI in the future.

But it's all besides the point, it doesn't matter what the device
special file looks like (if it's SCSI or not). What matters is that you
talk to the device the same way - and that way is currently SG_IO.
That a device hangs off the SCSI stack because that is the way the
author wrote eg usb-storage is irrelevant. What matters is that you open
the device in question and use SG_IO to talk to it.
Talking about the SCSI stack and ide-scsi completely misses the point.
