that explains it...

it's looking at the device control register first. if it's configured for
serial interutps then test it...my laptop for example uses serial interrupts
(plus the parallel PCI)
may be there are cards out there that need an exclusive interrupt. i don't
know.
the reason why i did it is the comment in the old code:
        /*
         * If ISA interrupts don't work, then fall back to routing card
         * interrupts to the PCI interrupt of the socket.
         *
         * Tweaking this when we are using serial PCI IRQs causes hangs
         *   --rmk
         */
the comment is there for a reason. so make sure DEVCTL is wrong, not MFUNC.
if we do check for all serial and don't fall back to PCI, the code wouldn't fixup
most of the non-working setups.

it does so by masking out the routing bits in the device control register, it
set it to PCI only...but read on

no, it's the way it should be. but it should really go back to the old value if 
serial interrupts probing failed. then it would be correct.
