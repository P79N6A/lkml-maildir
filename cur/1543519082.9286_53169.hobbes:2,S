"turn on" is'nt very hard I think.  You'll need some userland tool which
initializes the graphics some way (vm86/cpu emulator/whatever) and loads
a fbdev driver like this: "insmod genericfb mode=800x600x16 base=addr".
"switch" does'nt work with the current fbcon design.  The fbcon system
keeps a video mode for each vt.  You can run different video modes on
your virtual consoles if your fbdev driver supports mode switches. fbcon
will switch the video mode for you if you switch to a vt with a different
video mode.  If mode switches require some external utility, you'll run
in trouble ...
