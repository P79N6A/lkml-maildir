Just so I'm clear on what you are asking... Do you mean why am I using
macros or why the macros are needed at all?
To the former, I am more than happy to change them to functions, and, in
fact, I believe I have to for modules (EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL?) to be able to
call the sleep functions.
To the latter, having these 4 functions/macros makes it clear for what
reason you are sleeping. It leads to *correct* functionality of the
code, which we do not currently have.
