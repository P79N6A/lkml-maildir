LTTng is updating its logical clock there. Note that this clock is only used on
architectures missing a synchronised CPU timestamp counter (NUMA and old i586).
If you have a fairly standard architecture (i686 with TSC available), this
combination of jiffies counter and logical clock is not used.
Look for where the xtime_lock seqlock is taken in the -rt patch : that's where
the logical clock should be updated.
