Hi,
you're right, I just wanted to point that there's no reason
that we need to register a device etheir by hand or using
an "infamous script" (citation from Ben Collins
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=4435485
 )
due to the SCSI stack, but that it's only a SBP2 problem.
Regards.
