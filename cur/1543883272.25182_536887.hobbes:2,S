Mailing lists don't track bugs.
The _only_ reason why I originally started regression lists was because 
several kernel developers were spreading the fairy tale "noone tests -rc 
kernels".
This was only possible because so many bug reports to linux-kernel never 
get any reply, and are therefore lost.
After I started the regression lists, it suddenly turned out how many 
people test -rc kernels, and that even with regression lists at least 
weekly, it still often took weeks ontil some developer even started 
debugging a regression.
So what's the difference between bugzilla and lkml.org?
In Bugzilla we are able to see how bad our bug handling is...
