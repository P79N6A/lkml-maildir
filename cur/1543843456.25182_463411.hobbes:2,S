i disagree. Consider the following example from LTT:
 int sock_sendmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, size_t size)
 {
         struct kiocb iocb;
         struct sock_iocb siocb;
         int ret;
         trace_socket_sendmsg(sock, sock->sk->sk_family,
                 sock->sk->sk_type,
                 sock->sk->sk_protocol,
                 size);
         init_sync_kiocb(&iocb, NULL);
         iocb.private = &siocb;
         ret = __sock_sendmsg(&iocb, sock, msg, size);
         if (-EIOCBQUEUED == ret)
                 ret = wait_on_sync_kiocb(&iocb);
         return ret;
 }
what do the 5 extra lines introduced by trace_socket_sendmsg() tell us? 
Nothing. They mostly just duplicate the information i already have from 
the function declaration. They obscure the clear view of the function:
 int sock_sendmsg(struct socket *sock, struct msghdr *msg, size_t size)
 {
         struct kiocb iocb;
         struct sock_iocb siocb;
         int ret;
         init_sync_kiocb(&iocb, NULL);
         iocb.private = &siocb;
         ret = __sock_sendmsg(&iocb, sock, msg, size);
         if (-EIOCBQUEUED == ret)
                 ret = wait_on_sync_kiocb(&iocb);
         return ret;
 }
the resulting visual and structural redundancy hurts.
