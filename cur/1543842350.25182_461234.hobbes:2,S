The problem is that both ends of the bus need to know the cache line
size for some of these commands to work correctly.
Consider, as in Matthew's case, a read command which wraps at the cache
line boundary.  Unless both the master and slave are programmed with the
same cache line size, it's entirely possible for the wrong memory
locations to be read.
Eg, the device might expect 0x118, 0x11c, 0x100, 0x104, but it actually
gets 0x118, 0x11c, 0x120, 0x124 because the target got programmed with
64 while the master was set to 32.
This is, of course, supposing that the memory read command is used in
the cache line wrap mode.
