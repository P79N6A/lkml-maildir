The way I interpreted this is something like:
The usual way this goes (as I've seen it elsewhere) is that some fields
are "base page properties", so each struct page in the subarray of
mem_map the higher-order page represents can have some different,
meaningful value for the field, and so on. Others are "superpage
properties", which refer to the head of the higher-order page.
The MMU-less code appears to assume the refcounts of the tail pages
will remain balanced, and elevates them to avoid the obvious disaster.
But this looks rather broken barring some rather unlikely invariants. I
presume the patch is backing that out so refcounting works properly, or
in the nomenclature above (for which there is a precedent) makes the
refcount a superpage property uniformly across MMU and MMU-less cases.
It's unclear (to me) how the current MMU-less code works properly, at
the very least. It would appear to leak memory since there is no
obvious guarantee the reference to the head page will be dropped when
needed, though things may have intended to free the various tail pages.
i.e. AFAICT things really need to acquire and release references on the
whole higher-order page as a unit for refcounting to actually work,
regardless of MMU or no.
It may also be helpful for Greg Ungerer to help review these patches,
as he appears to represent some of the other MMU-less concerns, and
may have more concrete notions of how things behave in the MMU-less
case than I myself do (hardware tends to resolve these issues, but
that's not always feasible; perhaps an MMU-less port of a "normal"
architecture would be enlightening to those otherwise unable to
directly observe MMU-less behavior). In particular, correcting what
misinterpretations in the above there may be.
