I'm getting the feeling that the question of whether to step into
signal handlers is orthogonal to single-stepping; maybe it should be a
separate ptrace operation.
Platforms which don't implement PTRACE_SINGLESTEP would probably
appreciate this.  A "single step" which stops you after setting up the
signal trampoline and adjusting the PC, before executing any
instructions in the handler.
