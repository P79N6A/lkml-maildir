Subject: Another patch for isapnp crash with alsa
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2000/1/15/8

This fixes a crash for me when trying to load my sound modules
(alsa-driver-0.4.1i.) The
crash was in isapnp_find_dev.
Added to the "kernel BUG at
/usr/src/linux/include/asm/spinlock.h:78!" fix for the alsa drivers
somebody posted a few days ago I might have sound again...
