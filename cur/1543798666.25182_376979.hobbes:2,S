I have yet to see any resistance to the 4Kb patch this time around  
that was not "*whine* don't break my ndiswrapper plz".   There are  
extremely few remaining 4kb stack bugs, and 4k stacks have a sizeable  
list of technical advantages.

The point is to force it in -mm so most people can't just disable it  
because it fixes their problem.  We want 8k stacks to go away, and  
the only way to get out the last issues before sending to mainline is  
by forcing it in -mm.

This matter how?

I get the impression that they are already sufficiently addressed,  
although Andrew should feel free to correct me if I'm wrong :-D.

And removing 8kb all-together doesn't do this?

It's working partially now.  This is the time when we should really  
try to force ndiswrapper junkies over to the driver to get it tested  
and bugfixed for inclusion.

We're not trying to get it removed from mainline (yet), just from - 
mm, which has never been anywhere close to 100% safe _anyways_.  If  
it breaks lots of things horribly, it will get reverted and  
development will continue as normal, but that's probably not going to  
be the case.

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.   
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by  
definition, not smart enough to debug it.
