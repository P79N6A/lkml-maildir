Subject: Linux 2.6.9 pktgen module causes INIT process respawning and sickness
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

With pktgen.o configured to send 123MB/S on a gigabit on a system using 
pktgen set to the following parms:
pgset "odev eth1"
pgset "pkt_size 1500"
pgset "count 0"
pgset "ipg 5000"
pgset "src_min 10.0.0.1"
pgset "src_max 10.0.0.254"
pgset "dst_min 192.168.0.1"
pgset "dst_max 192.168.0.254"
After 37 hours of continual packet generation into a gigabit 
regeneration tap device,
the server system console will start to respawn the INIT process about 
every 10-12
hours of continuous packet generation.
As a side note, this module in Linux is extremely useful and the "USE 
WITH CAUTION" warnings
are certainly will stated.  The performance of this tool is excellent.
