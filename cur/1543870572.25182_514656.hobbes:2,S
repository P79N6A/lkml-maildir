That was the first one that caught my eye, but I wasn't sure about the
semantics of the error case.
There's also the error case for spu_run_init() which skips the master
stop. I guess that's ok because we've only set the master control in the
backing store, and the only way that will ever get propagated to an
actual spu is by coming back thorough spufs_run_spu().
What originally caught my eye on this was the output from xmon. When we
drop into xmon with no spu programs running and stop the spus, it
reports that they _all_ have the master run enabled, and some of them
have the runcntl enabled (those that have had spu programs run on them
since boot it seems).
It looks like the save/restore code sets the master bit in several
places, but never sets/clears the runcntl, which seems bogus to me.
So when we leave spufs_spu_run we do the master stop call:
spu_mfc_sr1_set: spu: c00000007ffdfc80 (15) sr1: 0x1b runcntl: 0x1
