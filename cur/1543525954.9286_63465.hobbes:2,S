Hi,
I've put up a new release of packet, the CD-R/W packet writing module.
The most important new feature is support for SCSI writers, and lots
of bugs fixes. I've also verified that CD's written with DirectCD
are directly usable when mounted rw in Linux.
Package available at:
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/axboe/packet
Changelog:
	- Fix oops on teardown of device (over written dentry)
	- Only flush device cache if device has been used
	- Fixup redirected request rq_dev
	- __scsi_merge_fn should not BUG() when merge is attempted
	  for non-contigous buffer, just fail.
	- Recount request segments
	- mode sense/select bug
	- Map queuedata from original queue to packet queue
	- Set disc type
	- Fix oops in ide-cd under certain conditions in
	  cdrom_analyze_sense_data()
	- Add PACKET_SETUP_DEV and PACKET_TEARDOWN_DEV to
	  sparc64 ioctl32 list.
	- Make config entry independent of IDECD
	- Port to 2.3.45
