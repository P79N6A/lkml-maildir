The kernel code segment is totally unacessible to userspace programs,
and to kernel itself, is marked read-write. A module runs at kernel
level, so, it has +rw to kernel memory. Each process has a task
structure that defines the top of memory that the user process can
access (current->fs). In normal processes, this is 0xbfffff (the last
adressable memory in user mode). After that, 0xc00000, starts the
kernel code. If, by using any method, a user process receives a
(current->fs = KERNEL_DS), it will be able to fully access the kernel
memory. As mentioned, this is unsual.
