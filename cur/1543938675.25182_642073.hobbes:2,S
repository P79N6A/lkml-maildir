When the spte is dropped, its dirty bit is transferred to the page.

That won't work for kvm.  If we have a hundred virtual machines, that 
means 99 no-op notifications.
Also, our rmap key for finding the spte is keyed on (mm, va).  I imagine 
most RDMA cards are similar.

The problem is that external mmus need a reverse mapping structure to 
locate their ptes.  We can't expand struct page so we need to base it on 
mm + va.

Can they wait on that bit?
