Hi
Hmm, I hit the same problem (only once so far) on 2.6.2 vanilla. While I 
was installing one of my first SATA systems, on ICH5, I hit the same thing 
(some error in kernel log regardning DMA and the SATA hdd seemed frozen, 
the only commands working were those cached in RAM already). Hope this 
helps :) (sorry I couldnt do more, it only happened once so far).
