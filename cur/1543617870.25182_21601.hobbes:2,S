   Im not sure aiming at least important is worth anything. Aiming at idle 
   processors on a box not doing power management seems easy providing you'll
   accept 99.99% accuracy. Switch the priority up in the idle code, switch it
   back down again before the idle task schedule()'s. If you hit during the
   schedule well tough.
$ egrep idle_me_harder arch/sparc64/kernel/process.c
$ egrep "idle_volume|redirect_intr" arch/sparc64/kernel/irq.c
Been there, done that :-)
Franks a lot,
