This only occurs if you try to build kernel modules externally like 
described in 
http://linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4389927951.html.
The DVB driver from CVS does it like this, I'm sure there are many
more cases where this could lead to problems.

Hmm, here is a compiler warning when builing modpost since my patch
accesses const char* memory directly (right after malloc()ing it).
The following patch has exactly the same effect but also makes gcc 
happy.
