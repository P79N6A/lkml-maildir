Do not build it as a module. It is not going to work in usual configurations.
Also, did you built CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE as a module and insmod-ded it
AFTER matroxfb?

Probably output #1 is already used by someone else. Build everything
to the kernel, you'll get much saner defaults then, as it forces 
correct order for crtc2 & maven initializations.
What reports 'matroxset -f /dev/fb0 -m' and 'matroxset -f /dev/fb1 -m' ?
Does not second one report that /dev/fb1 is currently displayed on that
output?
