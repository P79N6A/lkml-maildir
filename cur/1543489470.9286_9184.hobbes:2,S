   So you mean that your change fixed the stall for you? Did you tried it?
Although probably unrelated, there is a sysctl which turns off a TCP
feature that causes problems with certain printer TCP implementations.
Please try:
echo "0" >/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_retrans_collapse
And let me know if this makes the problem go away.
Later,
