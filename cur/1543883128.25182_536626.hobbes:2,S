Hi Vincent,
thanks for the report. It's pretty awesome though - all the USB devices 
seem to have vendor and product id set to 0x0000. Greg, have you ever met 
this? 
linux-usb-devel added to CC (full thread here: 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/4/27/496
)
So this definitely isn't a HID-specific problem, something is confusing 
the USB VID/PIDs.
