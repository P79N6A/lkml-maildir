how about the fact that Linus found the problem becouse his system didn't 
work right?

you are assuming that people want to suspend

isn't the sticker and specification for hardware? but in any case not all 
hardware needs to get that sticker.

distros aren't everything

the idea is that code that doesn't get compiled into the kernel can't 
cause the system to misbehave.
