However unlikely it may be, that is what I'm talking about in my "some"
or "all" cases. Note that I'm not talking about a specific implementation
(eg. XFS I guess avoids "some"), but just the possible scenarios.

So you need to eliminate the "some" case? Because of course "none" and
"all" are unavoidable.

But when you drop your locks, before the direct IO read returns, some
guy can mmap and dirty the pagecache anyway. By the time the read
returns, the data is stale. This obviously must be synchronised in
userspace.
As I said, you can't avoid "none" or "all", and you can't say that
userspace will see the most uptodate copy of the data. All you can
say is that it will be no older than when the syscall is first made.
Which is what you get if you simply writeback but do not invalidate
pagecache for direct IO reads.
