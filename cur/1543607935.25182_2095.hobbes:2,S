Is this the 'resume=force' stuff, by any chance? (driver/pci/bridge.c
et al.)?
I am trying to port this (only) to 2.4.12-ac5 or later, as I think
the lack of this may be why resume dies on the T23. If you have
a ready-made diff containing this, I would be very grateful
& will try here, & report back.
