Sort of.  You have to switch the console loglevel to at least 5 before
suspend to see the messages.
The kernel used to switch this to 10 unconditionally before and lots of
debug garbage got printed, especially on -mm.
We considered printing some "crucial" messages (like the progress meter ;-))
at KERN_CRIT, but decided not to do this for now.  We can change this at any
time, if needed.
Greetings,
