Thanks much. Definite ACK, very much including on the much better disable

However, I'm not sure, but:

The 'if this happens on the secondary CPU' sounds a bit like this is
directly checking the secondary CPU flag but cpu_has_pat translates into
boot_cpu_has(X86_FEATURE_PAT), refers always to the boot cpu. Yes, we
continued on on the boot CPU after the error message so this triggers,
but thought I'd make sure it was also intended this way. If so, never
mind...
I'm privately again placing this on top. If anyone has any explicit
testing suggestion, I'm all ears.
Rene.
