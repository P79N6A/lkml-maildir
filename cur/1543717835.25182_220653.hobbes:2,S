I guess the success ratio dependends on how many blocks are tied up in
the transaction, the size of the journal, and how much free space is
left in the filesystem.  In my tests (dd to a file that does O_TRUNC and
overwrites with the same file size) this change wasn't 100% successful
but fixed it the majority of the time.

Waiting for the currently committing transaction to complete would
deadlock Lustre, because it starts journal transactions above ext3 so
that it can write update records in the same transaction as the
filesystem operation.
