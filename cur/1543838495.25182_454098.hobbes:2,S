Subject: peculiar suspend/resume bug.

Here's a fun one.
- Get a dual core cpufreq aware laptop (Like say, a core-duo)
- Add a cpufreq monitor to gnome-panel. Configure it
  to watch the 2nd core.
- Suspend.
- Resume.
Watch the cpufreq monitor die horribly.
I believe this is because we take down the 2nd core at suspend
time with cpu hotplug, and for some reason we're scheduling
userspace before we bring that second core back up.
Anyone have any clues why this is happening?
