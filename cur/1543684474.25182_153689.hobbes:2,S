   Thats the well understood DMA bounce buffers problem.
It's definitely not the bounce buffers problem.  I installed the patch and
it doesn't help (well, maybe it helps a little; it's hard to tell).
However, I have pretty strong evidence that it's not the spinlock handoff
time either.  I wrote a small benchmark that starts two threads that do
nothing but hand two spinlocks back and forth.  The Athlon runs it an order
of magnitude _faster_ than the P4 (5ns vs. 50ns, roughly, per handoff).
I'm fairly certain that lock contention is involved somehow, though.
Lockmeter reports that lock waiting is consuming about 35% of the CPU cycles
when the problem is happening.  This isn't the 90% - 95% number I expected
-- the latter being the percentage of time spent in the kernel, as reported
by `top' -- but it's high enough to wonder about, and it may be artificially
low.  Lockmeter has a spinlock that protects its data structures, and the
profile says 36% of the time is being spent in the routine that acquires
that lock.  This suggests that lockmeter isn't counting that time.
One oddity pointed up by lockmeter is that `pagemap_lru_lock' is held by
`shrink_cache' some 85% of the time.  This seems way too high, and I am
looking into it.
