I don't think that's universally true at all, either from my own 
observations, or that of others I have talked to.
What I see is people operating in their own silos, and being terrified
to upgrade because they have no idea what random breakage will have
occured in mainline. When they get into that mode, the not only don't
suck new kernels down, they don't push their own changes up.
That's not healthy, and whatever we can do to encourage them to play
with the rest of the world more nicely would be healthy, I think.
