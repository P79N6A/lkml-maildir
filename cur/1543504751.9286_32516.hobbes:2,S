[1.] One line summary of the problem:
busy page invalidated error for 2.3.12
[2.] Full description of the problem/report:
I copied a cd to my hard drive and made an iso image using mkisofs
1.8a.21.  I then attempted to mount the image on the loopback device and
got the following:
Aug  3 13:03:58 wr5z kernel: ot necesserily a bug)
Aug  3 13:03:58 wr5z kernel: hm, busy page invalidated? (not necesserily
a bug)

Please note how the first message appeared to cut off the first part of
the message as compared to the second message.
I'm beginning to wonder if maybe there is a problem with the generic
scsi device used in ide-scsi emulation.  I'm referring to my previous
message regarding my problems making a cd under 2.3.12.  It could also
be interactions between cdrecord/mkisofs and the 2.3 kernels.  I'm
looking for pointers on how to track this down, or help you all track
this down.  Both the problems mentioned in this message and the one
mentioned in my previous message are reproducable.
