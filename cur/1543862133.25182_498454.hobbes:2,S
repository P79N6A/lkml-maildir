Being wexed from these problems, I didn't frame that question
properly. Okay, sorry for that.
I meant to ask choosing (from Xconfig tree)  a driver as module has
same affect compare to compiling a driver as kernel builtin feature?

The funda about the modules & bootloader I do know, thanks for explaining.
I did check the distro .config file (2.6.18-1.2868.fc6). Even I have
changed the my .config files according to the distro's. Even after
that, same error message.
Problem I think is choosing most of the drivers (allmost all) from the
Xconfig list? (even the one's I don't use/need). What do you suggest?
