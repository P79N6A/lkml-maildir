That sounds wrong of pci_save_msi_state().  It's supposed to save the
state, not to go fiddling with it.

Is that a sane thing for a driver to be doing?  (Not relevant to this issue
though).

Surely the drivers should be calling pci_disable_msix() or something after
saving the state rather than relying upon magical side-effects of
pci_save_msi_state().  Or we do disable_msi_mode() or whatever in
pci_disable_device().
