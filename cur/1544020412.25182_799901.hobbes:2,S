Hi,
May be it would be better to make the softlockup detector hooking into
schedule_timeout()
(ie by using a tracepoint) to check if a thread chose to sleep more
than hung_task_timeout_secs
intentionally in a TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE state.
Fixing it into kmemleak would not solve the problem in other tasks
which do similar sleeps...
Mandeep, if you agree I can try something? Or perhaps you prefer to do
it yourself. As you wish.
