Hi Linus,
7 patches for s390.
Short descriptions:
1) Basic patch to get kernel working on s390 again.
2) Compat fixes for s390. 
3) Common i/o layer patch. Most important change is the option to
   enable/disable path grouping. It makes no sense to try path grouping
   on devices that don't support it. It is now the decision of the device
   driver to use path grouping or not.
4) Some dasd stuff. Nothing important.
5) Correct call to SET_MODULE_OWNER in the network device drivers.
6) Fix two typos in xpram.
7) Return 0 on success in tty3215_init.
Patches are against linux-bk as of 2003/06/27.
blue skies,
  Martin.
