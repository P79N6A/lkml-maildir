No, it is not true that pagetable space can be wantonly wasted
on 64-bit.
Try mmap()'ing something sufficiently huge and accessing on average
every PAGE_SIZE'th virtual page, in a single-threaded single process.
e.g. various indexing schemes might do this. This is 1 pagetable page
per page of data (worse if shared), which blows major goats.
There's a reason why those things use inverted pagetables... at any
rate, compacting virtualspace with remap_file_pages() solves it too.
Large pages won't help, since the data isn't contiguous.
