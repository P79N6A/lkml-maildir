Yeah, which is listed under the "Obsolete" section in
Documentation/initrd.txt. The assumption I'm making here is that if
/linuxrc fails to execute, it falls back to /sbin/init on the currently
mounted root filesystem. Assumptions are bad, but I don't see why it
can't work like this. If there is a filesystem already mounted, it
should be used.
