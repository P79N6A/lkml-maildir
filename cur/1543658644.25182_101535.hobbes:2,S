In 2.5.55, we have a new section called "__gpl_ksymtab".
This, unfortunately, isn't mentioned in the linker script, and on ARM
gets placed at 0x1c58, where the rest of the kernel is at 0xcXXXXXXX.
This section isn't even mentioned in the x86 linker script, so there
isn't an example of the placement expectations of this section.
Rusty, can you provide the missing bits please?
