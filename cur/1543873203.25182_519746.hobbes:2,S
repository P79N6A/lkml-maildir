The adjustments that I spoke of above are working regardless of ntp ..
The stability of the TSC directly effects the clock mult adjustments in
timekeeping, as does interrupt latency since the clock is essentially
validated against the timer interrupt.

like I said there are other factors so that's not going to exactly model
cpu speed changes. You could come up with another method, but that would
likely require another known constant clock.

sched_clock doesn't measure amounts of cpu work either, it's all about
timing.

That's true, but given a constant clock (like what sched_clock should
have) then the accounting is similarly inaccurate. Any connection
between the scheduler and the TSC frequency changes aren't part of the
design AFAIK ..

I haven't followed the "stolen time" discussion, but just a brief look
at your first email I'd say don't mess with the clocks .. The clocks
should always reflect the time accurately .. That's the point of the
clocks, and when the TSC, or any other clock, changes frequency it
sucks..
I haven't thought it through completely, but you might be able to solve
the issue by adding a value to each jiffie in the scheduler or altering
the scheduler to extend the number of jiffies a task gets pending on the
virtual speed of the cpu..
