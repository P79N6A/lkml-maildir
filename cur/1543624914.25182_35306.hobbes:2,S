It may well be borderline but its certainly interesting the rmap vm thinks
it is out of memory first. Whats the overcommitted_AS value just before it
reports that it cannot allocate memory.
I'm also interested to know if it occurs with a lot more swap. It might be
a false report coming from a bug in the vm accounting changes too
