Impossible. It reverts huge parts of the fbdev API almost completely to 
the 2.4.x state, and I was already outvoted in that vote couple of 
times since January.
BTW, with my patch accented characters works correctly only on VT1.
I'm not sure how it behaves on Linus tree...
And I'm not saying that there are no bugs in the matroxfb which is in
Linus's kernel. But as nobody even answered my question I sent out on 
monday whether it is correct that FBIOGETCMAP ioctl can overwrite arbitrary 
kernel memory, I kinda lost an interest in the stock fbdev...
                                           Best regards,
                                                Petr Vandrovec
