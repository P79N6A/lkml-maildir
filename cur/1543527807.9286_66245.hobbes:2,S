The TSC operates at the core cpu rate not busrate AFIK. The user I was
replying to was running both a 400 (4x100) and a 450 (4.5x100). Since the
PII/III have locked multipliers the system was actually running with two
differnt CPU speeds (he said he was and insisted that this was okay).
So, the rate there is indeed differnt. Not a good thing. :)
