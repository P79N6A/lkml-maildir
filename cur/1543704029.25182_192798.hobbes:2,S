Does it go away if you just make "acpi_pic_set_level_irq()" do nothing (ie 
just remove the "outb()" call
	arch/i386/kernel/acpi/boot.c line 273
or just make the if-statement be always false).
It's entirely possible that the SCI is just horribly broken, and can't be 
level-triggered.
Btw, usually a good idea to at least cc the developer list for the 
particular subsystem. In this case <acpi-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>. 
Many people don't have the time to follow linux-kernel.
