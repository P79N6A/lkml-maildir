I seen that on one computer too, with 2.5.59. For some strange reason IRQ0 from 
timer was stopped, and thus system reported jiffies + tsc / <host_cpu_freq> as 
current time, taking only 32bit tsc into account. After I disabled irqbalance, 
problem never reappered (it was two cpus PIII from Dell, with serverworks chipset 
& 8GB memory; I do not remember model number).
System worked in that state for several minutes, until it lost some NFS reply, which
it never retried due to stopped timer...
