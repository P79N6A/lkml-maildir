hey, let's be serious here. 
Linux works...and works...and works...ad infinitum(?) 
In my opinion, it has the best minds from all around
the world making contributions to its development. 
It works and will continue to work better. _i_ believe
that if we counted 'limitations' of every kernel/system
out here, linux would be among the ones having the least
'limitations' -- if not the one with the least.  if you 
cite 'limitation X' as making a system unsuitable for 
'task Y', then all you have to do is change strategically
redifine 'X' to ensure that _your_ favorite system is 
_always_ the most suitable for 'task Y'. i know linux to
be a very stable system and i think that the attribute of 
stability makes a system suitable for the task of computing 
aside from any 'limitation/attribute X' viewpoints (period)
