Hi
This is a known issue that appeared in 2.6.7-mm6. See below for a
temporary fix. Check the [2.6.7-mm6 -  USB problems] thread on
linux-usb-devel@lists.sourceforge.net for more info.

<-- msg from Alan Stern -->
This patch fixes a problem with my recent set of locking changes for
USB.
The problem is that rw-semaphores don't have the semantics I need.  I
need
something where, if the semaphore is locked for reading and a writer is
waiting for the lock, another reader will be granted a readlock
immediately.  That's because there are several places where a thread
holding the readlock will acquire the readlock again, in a nested or
recursive fashion.  If a writer is waiting for the first readlock to be
released, the standard semantics will yield deadlock.
This patch implements those alternate semantics by putting writers on a 
separate wait queue.  It's a little bit awkward and has a definite 
roll-you-own flavor, but it works.  Please apply.
