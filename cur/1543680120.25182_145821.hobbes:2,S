Actually, the opposite: start login niced to +X (x ~= 5).  This is a tidy way 
of providing the user with the needed manuevering room on the not-nice side, 
and is guaranteed not to interfere with root processes.  All logins on that 
machine would have to start with that same positive niceness, including for 
example, ssh logins.  The correct place to centralize this is the login 
program, I think, perhaps by making it aware of some environment variable or 
some setting in /etc.
To work well, this strategy has to be coupled with a scheduler guarantee that 
no priority level can completely starve any lower priority.  At this point, I 
don't know where we stand in that regard.
Regards,
Daniel
