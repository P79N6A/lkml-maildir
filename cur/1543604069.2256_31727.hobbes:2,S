... doesn't fix _under_run in try_modload() (see what happens if namelen is
255 and parent is devfs root)
... doesn't fix the deadlock introduced into -pre6 in place of symlink
races. That
    /*  Need to follow the link: this is a stack chomper  */
    down_read (&symlink_rwsem);
    retval = curr->registered ?
        search_for_entry (parent, curr->u.symlink.linkname,
                          curr->u.symlink.length, FALSE, FALSE, NULL,
                          TRUE) : NULL;
    up_read (&symlink_rwsem);
is a fairly bad idea.  Think what happens if somebody else tries to
acquire symlink_rwsem for write between two calls of down_read() in
that recursion.
