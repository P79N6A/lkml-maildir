And if client-server link is fully saturated by messages
we do not win :) We also lose if client-server is slower than
server-server... I completely agree that there are cases where each
approach is more beneficial, and likely client-to-many os better in
terms of management and/or failover, but for speed there is always a
different side of the coin.
