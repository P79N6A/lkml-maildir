You're VERY wrong here. St. Petersburg was the name before the Soviet
Union was formed and Russia marched into the Baltics. When the takeover
was made, the city was renamed Leningrad (after V.I. Lenin). When the
Soviet Union finally fell to pieces and the Baltics retained their freedom,
St. Petersburg retained its old name, which it got (if I'm not all wrong)
from Peter the Great.
