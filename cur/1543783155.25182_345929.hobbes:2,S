Wow, they are hidden nicely :-)
I was looking for a tar ball or something. Not a patch.  Well, anyway I
took a look at it, and it is pretty much like mine. But I wanted to
eliminate any more system calls than I needed. Grant you, that my test
is not portable to anything other than ia86.  But it gives me the
results that I wanted.
Thanks,
