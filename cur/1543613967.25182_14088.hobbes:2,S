Forget to tell, I'd really love to be proved wrong on this one on
practice (if you have a patch that makes the system faster than rc2aa1
you will certainly change my mind in a jiffy), just catch rc2aa1 and see
if the loop is performing well for you or not, it'm safisfied with it
here.
My main worry at the moment is the other deadlock report of yesterday
(still waiting the SYSRQ+T to see what gone wrong for him :)
