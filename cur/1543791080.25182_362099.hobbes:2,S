This patchset I have had around for a long time and improves
various zone and watermark balancing by making calculations
more logical.
When reading 128GB through the pagecache, in 4 concurrent
streams, the final page residency and total reclaim ratios
look like this (no highmem, ~900MB RAM):
2.6.14-git3
DMA pages=  2214, scan= 124146
NRM pages=215966, scan=3990129
      Pages  Scan
DMA  01.01  03.01
NRM  98.99  96.99
2.6.14-git3-vm
DMA pages=  2220, scan=  99264
NRM pages=216373, scan=4011975
      Pages  Scan
DMA  01.01  02.41
NRM  98.99  97.59
So in this case, DMA is still getting a beating, but things have
improved nicely. Now are results with highmem and ~4GB RAM:
2.6.14-git3
DMA pages=0, scan=0
NRM pages=177241, scan=1607991
HIG pages=817122, scan=1607166
     Pages  Scan
DMA 00.00  00.00
NRM 17.83  50.01
HIG 82.17  49.99
2.6.14-git3-vm
DMA pages=0, scan=0
NRM pages=178215, scan=553311
HIG pages=815771, scan=2757744
     Pages  Scan
DMA 00.00  00.00
NRM 17.92  16.71
HIG 82.07  83.28
Current kernels are abysmal, while the patches bring scanning to
an almost perfect ratio.
