Interesting observation.
slab is a zone allocator and stores objects of the same type
into zones. The theory behind that is that normally that objects of the same
type have similar livetimes and that should in theory avoid
many fragmentation problems.
However some caches like dcache/inode cache don't seem to follow
that, and kmalloc which mixes all kinds of objects into the same
caches especially doesn't.

For memory-constrained environments there is already the optional 
specialized "slob" allocator.
That said even big systems have problems with fragmentation.
It is good that the basic assumptions behind slabs are being
revisited now. I suspect some of them might be obsolete.
