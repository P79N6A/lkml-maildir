Subject: [GIT PATCH] I2C bugfixes for 2.6.17-rc4 - resend
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/5/12/264

Here are some i2c bug fixes for a single driver against your current git
tree.  They all have been in the -mm tree for a few weeks.
Please pull from:
	rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/i2c-2.6.git/
or from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/i2c-2.6.git/
if it isn't synced up yet.
The full patch series was sent to the sensors mailing list the last time
this notice was sent out, so I'll not resend them.
thanks,
greg k-h
