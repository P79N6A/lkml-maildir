Andrew,
We export to userspace the acct_rss_mem1 and acct_vm_mem1, both as u64.
The above logic is to calculate stime delta since last update. Note that
acc_update_integrals() is invoked at do_execve, do_exit, _AND_ at
account_system_time, which is called every jiffy by timer interrupt
handler.
The tsk->acct_stimexpd is used to save the tsk->stime of last update.
It should be changed to cputime_t as well. I will include the fix in
my next fix patch.

This is not a BSD accounting thing. It came from UNICOS and IRIX.
I am pinging the person who knows how the real world users use these
two fields...
