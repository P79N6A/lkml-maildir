Since installing 2.2.15pre4 I've had the system gronk twice on me.  Both
times it seemed to run OK for a while after booting, but after leaving
it alone overnight and coming back I've had X lock up on me.  The first
time netscape became blocked in oldselect() (as reported by strace), and
then when I tried to kill it X bombed out with it; when I restarted X it
locked up while fvwm2 was starting up my initial applications.  The
second time X just locked without any warning.  Unfortuately no kernel
oopses were logged and I can't find any other diagnostics in my logs.
