The only thing which is really 'external API' there is the declaration
of the HDIO_XXX ioctl and among them in reality only HDIO_GETGEO 
      is really used outside the scope of the dreddy hdparm application. 
And
99% of times its usage is bogous anyway. Or do you know any better
examples I'm not aware of?
The remainings will be moved away from there soon becouse it doesn't
make any sense to include this at every single place out there where
HDIO_GETGEO is the needed declaration. If some application needs ATA 
command macros - it should come with they own header declaring them 
instead of peeing in to the kernel becouse they don't depend on the
kernel in question. They are cut in stone at www.t13.org ;-).

I know - see above.
