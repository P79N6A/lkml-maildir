The server certainly is not required to send back the same filehandle
for hardlinked files, but it should.  Otherwise, the client (linux
kernel) cannot assume the files are the same according to the RFC
(which in reality they are).  Currently, the kernel makes the
assumption they are the same implicitly, by only using fileid to lookup
inodes.
