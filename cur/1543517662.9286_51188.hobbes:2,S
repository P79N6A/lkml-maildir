Hello,
there were some complaints about linux not handling upper/lowercase
filenames in vfat correctly (they are below). So I did some investigation.
I created following directories (or files, it does not matter):
in Linux: LINUP, linlow
in win98: 98UP, 98low
in NT4: NTUP, ntlow
in W2k: W2KUP, w2klow
Now what ls/dir shows:
in Linux: LINUP, linlow, 98up, 98low, ntup, ntlow, w2kup, w2klow
in win98: LINUP, LINLOW, 98UP, 98low, NTUP, NTLOW, W2KUP, W2KLOW
in NT4: LINUP, linlow, 98UP, 98low, NTUP, ntlow, W2KUP, w2klow
in W2K: LINUP, linlow, 98UP, 98low, NTUP, ntlow, W2KUP, w2klow
So I would suggest NT/W2K shows everything correctly (if we can call so,
because microsoft mixed everything up), and win98/Linux shows differently
in opposite directions. I think Linux should follow one of win95/98 or NT/W2K,
and since NT/W2K seams more reasonable, Linux could display filenames
like NT (Linux creates filenames similar to NT already).
There is no such problem with mixed up/low or with filenames
containing more than 8 characters.
