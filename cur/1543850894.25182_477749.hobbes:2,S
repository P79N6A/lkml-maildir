>Exactly how are aes-loop and raid5 connected together?
We use 5x300gb drives in a raid5 array, which is then used as a physical
disk in an lvm volume, with one logical volume. This logical volume is
then encrypted with "losetup -e aes /dev/loop1 /dev/vg0/lv0", and then
formatted with ReiserFS.
>Is the loop above the raid5 or below?
It's below the raid5, since the raid5 is created straight onto the
drives.
>A precise description of how things are arranged would help.
Does the above look good enough?
>A copy of /proc/mdstat would be good to.
