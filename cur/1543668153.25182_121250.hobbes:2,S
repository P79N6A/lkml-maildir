	I represent the users which need this most, and I an tell you we
will be 100x happier pointing and guessing at enough dev_t space.  If we
were to have to stick with the ancient, serously outdated limits of the
current space, we will be terribly unhappy.
	Not having the perfect solution all at once doesn't mean you do
nothing.  The size of dev_t is orthogonal to device naming.  Once this
is in, the current device naming (however poor it is) can handle the
number of devices we need.  Future device naming strategies (like the
one Greg is working on) will work with a large dev_t just fine.
