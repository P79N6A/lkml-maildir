One does not need to patch the kernel to do this...
	% sysctl -w vm.legacy_va_layout=1
(some systems process an /etc/sysctl.conf during boot)
Of course, if you need 32bit apps before that can be set during boot-up,
messing with the kernel will be necessary.  I will point out, the sysctl
var totally disables flex mmap.
