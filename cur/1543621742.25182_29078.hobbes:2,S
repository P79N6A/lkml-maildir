Well, you can't be too surprised when everybody doesn't jump to review
driver changes for hardware that dates to the early 80's  :)
I think your change may break true MDA cards (as in an original full
length 8 bit text only card, clustered with enough TTL chips that could
heat a small room...)
If I read the current code right, the p==q case means that TYPE_MDA 
remains set, and these cards don't get mda_initialize().  Only the
TYPE_HERC* cards get mda_initialize().
Your change forces TYPE_HERC and forces mda_initialize() on all 
non Herc cards, which is a departure from existing behaviour.
So, there are two possibilities:
   1) mda_initialize() should really be called hga_initialize() and
      your card is simply broken in some way  :)
or
   2) mda_initialize() is also needed for some non Herc cards too.
What kind of card did you say needed this change?
Paul.
