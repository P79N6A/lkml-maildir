How did I not notice them? Yeah, those guys would be on the suspicious list...

I've gotten it down to about 128 patches, but it's interesting what ended
up bracketed by GOOD/BAD:
powerpc-invalid-size-for-swapper_pg_dir-with-config_pte_64bit=y.patch   GOOD
#GREGKH-DRIVER-START
gregkh-driver-nozomi.patch
    gregkh-moby-patch-tree....
unbork-gregkh-driver-kset-convert-sys-devices-to-use-kset_create-vioc.patch BAD
Would I be remiss in hypothesising that something in gregkh-driver-kobject-*
changed something, and now we need a agk-dm-dm-kobject-fixupage.patch?
The actual bug is probably elsewhere, but it *manifests* due to gregkh-driver
tree.  Will probably be tomorrow before I get it down further...
