OK, replace xxx with mutex, and what I've said still holds true for ia64.

It does not, none of the unlock functions ever have.

They should be deleted (and from mutex-xchg). NOT because there is no 
need for
a memory barrier, but because the atomic_alter_value_and_return_something
functions always provide a barrier before and after the operation, as per
Documentation/atomic_ops.txt
Again, lock / unlock operations require acquire / release consistency. 
This is a
memory ordering operation. It is not equivalent to smp_mb, though.
