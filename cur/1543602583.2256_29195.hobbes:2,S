Ugh.  Maybe a wrapper script (netconsole-server) which automates this is
in order?  I imagine the eth_byteX is a MAC address (or at least that this
is in the documentation)?

Any chance the netconsole-client can be set up to listen for multiple hosts
and log to the local syslog?  This would allow you to run netconsole-client
on your normal syslog host and add timestamps, clean up old logs, etc.
I take it that this is only a one-way interface (i.e. logs sent from the
server to the client), and not a real serial-console replacement?

In any case, this will be EXTREMELY useful for me, as a lot of new machines
do not have serial ports and are a PITA to debug in case of a crash.  Thanks.
Cheers, Andreas
