I can observe the same "Synaptics lost sync" messages on Acer TravelMate 242XC 
with ACPI enabled (without APM even compiled) on 2.6.0-test[0-9]. But I 
silently ignore these messages - touchpad works ok. I use an USB mouse, but 
messages appear even without it plugged.
"Losing too many ticks" exists when I'm running with cpufreq [p4_clockmod] and 
clock=tsc (default). This is because of rescaling TSC pitch by cpufreq, I 
think. If I specify in bootloader clock=hpet, problem disappears. [Am I doing 
right?]
I can provide more information if somebody is interested.
Cheers
Szymon
