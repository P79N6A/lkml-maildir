It was a bad mistake in retrospect. I limited ub to 8 partitions
because I wanted to fit 26 devices into 8 bits of minor.

Doing so would not be compatible for systems which do not run udevd.
Linus forbade such changes, and I agree. So, if we strongly needed
ub to go beyond 1+7 partitions, we would need some kind of a remapping
scheme. I have to discuss this with Greg or Harald. Making dis-
contiguous nodes is easy with mknod, but I do not know if udev
supports it.

Your mailer corrupted your patch. The attached ought to work better,
but it's a subject to aforementioned compatibility problems.
