verify_area() simply checks that the address is a legal one for a userspace
access (it's not a chunk of kernel memory).  But the kernel can still take
a pagefault when accessing the address, so you need to use the uaccess
functions which will handle the fault appropriately.
That's put_user(), get_user(), copy_*_user(), etc.  Those functions
internally perform verify_area(), so if you've already done a verify_area()
you can use __put_user(), __get_user(), etc which skip the verify_area()
but which still know how to deal with user address faults.
