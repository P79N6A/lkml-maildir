I'm not understanding what the problem is?
Why don't these people just use "ioread*()/iowrite*()"? 
In other words, the whole point of *not* using "read*/write*()" is that 
you get a whole slew of much nicer interfaces.
So can people explain this fundamental issue? Why do people insist on 
using the old interfaces (and matching them with the new setup)?
