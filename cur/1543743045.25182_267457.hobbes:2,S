The better cpu proportion guarantee without low latency of such a policy 
would be desirable to video encoding in the background while capturing 
in the foreground as one immediately recognisable purpose, and there are 
likely numerous others, so I agree it's a good idea.
However the non-interactive mode addresses a number of different needs 
that seem to have come up. Specifically:
I have had users report great success with such a mode on my own 
scheduler in multiple X session setups where very choppy behaviour 
occurs in mainline.
Many high performance computing people do not wish interactivity code 
modifying their choice of latency/distribution - admittedly this is a 
soft one.
What are your thoughts on this?
