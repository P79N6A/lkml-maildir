A shorter name for this, which is preferred (i.e., will always work) is
	
http://linuxusb.bkbits.net:8088/dietHotplug
To clone the tree
	bk clone 
http://linuxusb.bkbits.net/dietHotplug
should work fine.  I'm trying to talk the owner of bk.net out of the 
domain name, if I get it, we'll use that to save on the tired fingers.
