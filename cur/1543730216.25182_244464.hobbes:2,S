A function looks like this:
int present()
{
}
A prototype for the same function looks like this:
int present(void);
Functions always have "{}". Prototypes never do.

case... ignore them.
If you compile above a certain warning-level, then prototypes
are required. The prototype usually goes in header files
and the function (the actual code) goes in the source files.

Do `depmod -e test.ko` to see what it's complaining about. You
can see all the symbols by using `nm`. Try it. Your code
probably didn't define the necessary stuff to make a module.
You need to look at a typical module (driver) that comes with the
kernel. Just find one of the shortest ".c" files in the driver
tree.
