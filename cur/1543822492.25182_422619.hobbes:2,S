It seems you don't understand the problem at all:
First of all note that your example does not apply in this case:
copy_semid_from_user() does _not_ initialize sembuf in all cases.
And you do not understand where gcc's problem is:
gcc does in fact see that setbuf is always initialized if 
copy_semid_from_user() returns 0.
setbuf is only initialized in the (cmd == IPC_SET) case and later only 
used in the (cmd == IPC_SET) case. And cmd can't change between the two 
occurences.
Therefore, gcc should in theory already have enough information to prove 
that sembuf is always initialized before it's used.
