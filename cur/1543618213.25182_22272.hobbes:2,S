No problem on copyright, licences,...
I choose (for the file names, not for the 'make autoconfig') a
longer name, to distinguish the kernel autoconfig from the
GNU autoconf (without the final 'ig').
Only for pratical reasons.
If autoconfigure will go in the kernel, I have not problems on
filenames, but when I initially created it, I thinked ev. to
distribuite it as a package. Here the name matter.
IMHO longer filename ia a good things (iff normal user should
not type it).
