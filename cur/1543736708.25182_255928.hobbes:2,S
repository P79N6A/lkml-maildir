I just built a kernel with that latest stack-fix patch in it too, but 
haven't rebooted to it yet.  I read that as being moderately 
important in some cases although I don't think I've encountered that 
particular case yet.  Was this in fact a good idea for me?

That would I assume need a null modem cable, and what do I run on the 
firewall?  Minicom?  Or is there something better that can just grab 
and log without being interactive?  Its a rh7.3 box with a 2.4.18 era 
kernel.  I'd update that, but its not broken. :)
