I will update this and to all the places where FRAME_SIZE_LIMIT was
used as default ro rx and tx sizes.

I think this can be removed all together, as it remains zero only.

Ok. I will update this.

I can remove the "case SIOCGRECEIVING" altogether then.

Correct. Then I have to think passing those information using either
device resources or revert back to #ifdefers in omap-ir.c. Any
suggestions?

As H3 and H4 platforms uses gpio_expander (through I2C) for selecting
between IrDA and GPS Module, and that code is being called from IRQ
context, as you know that gpip_expander code ultimately leades to I2C
code and which can sleep.
