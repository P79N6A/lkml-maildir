Hi Ben,
    I attached a perl script to this email that will let you turn an rpm
into a cpio file.  To use it do:
	rpm2cpio some.file.rpm | cpio --extract
Hope this helps.

# why does the world need another rpm2cpio?  because the existing one
# won't build unless you have half a ton of things that aren't really
# required for it, since it uses the same library used to extract RPM's.
# in particular, it won't build on the HPsUX box i'm on.
# add a path if desired
