	Really?  Sure as hell hasn't been my experience.  Oh!  That only
works with Windows 95!  Ok, now you can get the driver to support Windows
98 but it won't support Windows NT (got one RIGHT NOW like that).  Oops,
you upgraded to Windows 2000, can't support that with that driver, we
don't have a driver for that yet.  Windows XP, sorry, we don't have the
Windows XP certified driver, yet, try back in a few months.
	Think that's a joke?  I think it's pathetic and it is EXACTLY
what I have experienced with multimedia cards, scanners, and printers.

	Why would Windows XP break all the non-MS Windows 2000 drivers
(don't you dare tell me it didn't, I work at a place that got slammed by
their shit).  Why would things that work on Windows 98 (Delorme Eartha
DVD) not work on Windows NT or Windows 2000.  The Windows mess is a swamp
out there of what drivers work with what version (some don't even work
between the original editions and updated editions - Windows 95 had
three editions that I have in hand).
