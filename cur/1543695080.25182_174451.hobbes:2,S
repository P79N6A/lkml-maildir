Is there any change to get rid of this "legacy"?  From my (still quite 
limited) understanding of the english language, this means old/outdated 
and has a not-so-good connotation. It's not just a fact, but puts a 
negative value into something. But maybe I'm wrong.
Anyway, on embedded arches it makes no sense to say "Oh, PCI is all wow, 
non-pci is all boo".
I talked on the arm-linux-kernel mailing list and Russell King answered:

In the hope that this happens I included a patch below.
If wished, I can provide a bigger patch that renames "
legacy_bus" to "legacy_bus" as well.
