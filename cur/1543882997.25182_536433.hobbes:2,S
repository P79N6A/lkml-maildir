Subject: commit 45cd8d8e -- why?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The changelog says:
    fs/sysfs/bin.c: In function 'read':
    fs/sysfs/bin.c:77: warning: format '%zd' expects type 'signed size_t', but argument 4 has type 'int'
but the signature of the function read() is
    read(struct file * file, char __user * userbuf, size_t count, loff_t * off)
and git blame seems to show it was always thus -- ie count was always size_t.
And now on x86-64 and ia64 with gcc 4.1 at least, I get:
    fs/sysfs/bin.c: In function 'read':
    fs/sysfs/bin.c:62: warning: format '%d' expects type 'int', but argument 4 has type 'size_t'
Andrew, what compiler were you using to get that warning?  Should we
revert commit 45cd8d8e?
