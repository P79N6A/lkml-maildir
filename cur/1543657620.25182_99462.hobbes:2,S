For those needing more interpretation, this is essentially a reinstatement
of the 2.4.x-style pgd/pmd cache optimization in a leak-free and accounted
(in /proc/slabinfo) manner.
The point of the optimizations is that these initializations are large
cache hits to take in a single shot, and in the PAE case, amount to a
full L1 cache flush as they traverse almost an entire 16K.
No rigorous benchmarking has been done yet.
