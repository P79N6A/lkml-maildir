Hey,
while trying to define a non-unique devalias at the Sun PROM prompt
(the SPARCclassic X has wrong aliases for scsi, disk1, etc. in the
PROM, at least mine) I fell over a bug resulting in an endless loop
while booting the kernel.
The problem is the getting the properties list of the /aliases node.
As the next element in this list is identified by name and the
function which retrieves this property always returns the first
occurrence this goes forever....
I could track down the issue to the function __prom_nextprop() in
arch/sparc/prom/tree.c, but I am now looking for the definition of
prom_nodeops->no_nextprop() without success.
My naive solution would be to return not the first but the last
occurrence of a property.
Greetings,
	Markus
