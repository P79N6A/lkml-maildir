Linux-2.2 perfectly complies to all these musts and shoulds.
Solaris ftp server is broken. Apparently, it turns off Nagle algorithm
by an unknown reason and fragments 8K chunks brainlessly and shamelessly,
never merging segments, even if it has queued data.
And it gets exactly the thing which it deserves. 8)8)

Not configurable, but always. RFC "should" is too weak for real world.

The comment is misguiding. Linux-2.2 does not this.
To be more exact, it ACKs only the first packet.

No. I digged in this last week and, seems, found an acceptable
solution. ftp;//ftp.inr.ac.ru/ip-routing/softnet-991214-wrt-2.3.33.dif.gz.
