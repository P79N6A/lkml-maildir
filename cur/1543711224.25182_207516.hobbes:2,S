	It is at least theoeretically possible that a microcode update might cause
an operation that's normally done very quickly (in dedicated hardware) to be
done by a slower path (microcode operations) to fix a bug in the dedicated
hardware that is very obscure and very unlikely to ever bother you. However,
I have never heard of even a single confirmed instance where this happened.
