Hmmm...  Maybe my stupid workaround for my old 486 wasn't so stupid after
all.  Circa 1994 486 with 13 gig hd; no way to get the bios to recognize
the correct geometry:  max of 4096 cylinders.  I just set c/h/s to
1023/16/63 and made a ~500 meg / 128 meg swap and 2 more 6+ gig partitions
and it works just fine with kernel 2.2.13.  'Course it is a Maxtor drive.

  For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit
within him?  In the same way, no one knows the thoughts of God except
the Spirit of God.  We have not received the spirit of the world but the
Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given
us.
