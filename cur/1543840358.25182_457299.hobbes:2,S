As others have noted, the *right* semantics for this is being able to inject a
1% or higher rate in the code you're interested in, while maintaining a 0
injection rate for things outside the module under test.  Maybe a /debug/
failslab/address_start and address_end, and a userspace helper that peeks at a
System.map and injects the right values - then it's a simple compare of the
high/low addresses provided against the caller address.
