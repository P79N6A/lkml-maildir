this is the user-space visible msgbuf structure, the
actual structure is  "msg_msg", defined at the beginning
of ipc/msg.c. This structure does not contain that byte.
Could you wait until Friday? I'd like to check the POSIX
standard: a zero-sized message contains a msgtype, and perhaps
someone sends zero-sized messages with a special msgtype
to recover from an overflown msgqueue?
Thanks for your bug report,
