would you please write logic rules with more neutral language, like
(A || B) && C
or similar. Depencies (forward or backward) can be described as
SYM_FOO <- { # depencies/value
  ($SYM_DEP1 || !$SYM_DEP2) && $SYM_DEP3=xx
  # implicit or
  $SYM_DEP4 || $SYM_DEP5
} -> { # selects
  SYM_2SELECT1 = $SYM_BAR ? foo_bar : bar_for
  SYM_2SELECT2 = bar; SYM_BA; SYM_ZZ
# SYM_BA && SYM_ZZ will have value of SYM_FOO
}
or something.

I try to design TUI now for better multidimensional walking/selecting on
the web of symbols and decencies, and i don't get those kconfig
constructs.

Thanks.
