Good for you. Most people can't/won't wait for it. They will see that linux 
doesn't have a key feature for enterprises, and say that linux still isn't 
mature enough for them and at best only use linux on some dinky little 
webservers, like it has been used in the past. There isn't a whole lot of 
that market left. If we want to move forward and offer something to a 
broader base of companies, we need features like this included.

p.s. Maybe you could keep your replies to constructive criticism, instead of 
just dogging EVMS. Some people actually do want linux to improve.
