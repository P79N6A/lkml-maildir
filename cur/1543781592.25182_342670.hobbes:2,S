Sorry, I don't understand you. CLONE_THREAD implies CLONE_SIGHAND,
so we always need to lock one ->sighand. Could you please clarify?

Yes, this is bad and should be fixed, I agree.
But why do you think we need to bump task->usage? It can't make any
difference, afaics. The task_struct can't dissapear, the caller was
converted to use rcu_read_lock() or it holds tasklist_lock.
Nonzero task_struct->usage can't stop do_exit or sys_wait4, it will
only postpone call_rcu(__put_task_struct_cb).
And after we locked ->sighand we have sufficient memory barrier, so
if we read the stale value into 'sp' we will notice that (if you were
worried about this issue).
Am I missed something?

Very strange code. Why this check? And what happens with
	spin_unlock(&tsk->sighand->siglock);
when tsk->sighand == NULL ?
