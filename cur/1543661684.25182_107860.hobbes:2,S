The 3.06G parts are pretty available, but the prices are just getting
silly. I suppose it will drop when the supply of parts exceeds the
demand of people who can't wait.

There is one "fix" going around which supposedly works using the
firmware upgrade capability. I have no idea if it does or even could
work, I never had the guts to try it, because I'm not sure that changes
really go away on power cycle, and I didn't get it from a trusted
source. The idea of untrusted code running in the firmware is scarier
than booting Windows.

This is my understanding, and it makes the idea of a firmware fix sound
more possible, by just enabling the 2nd sibling if HT capability exists.
I'll still let wonone else check it out first...
