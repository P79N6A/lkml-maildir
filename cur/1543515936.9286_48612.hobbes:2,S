A quick special-case check on zones known to be empty would allow you to
maintain performance even if you have zones which will never have any
pages in them on a given machine.
You need this anyway --- Alan pointed out that it is a significant hit
on benchmarks if, during normal running, one zone fills up and you start
falling back routinely to a lower zone.
