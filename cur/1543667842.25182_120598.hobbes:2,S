Hi all,
I want to develop a clustere  file system using independent Blade 
servers (about 96 in number) running linux. Each blade  having  2 or 
more SCSI disks attached to it. In order to build our own filesystem  I 
need to  do direct  writing/reading  in the SCSI disk bypassing all the 
kernel level buffering. 
Could you please suggest some information as how to go about it.
Best Regards,
