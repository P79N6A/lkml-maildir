As I mentioned to Richard Jonson, it can be considered as
ioctl. ioctl-ng!
Unified interface (as ioctl) can be used for any type of modules.
It is just a bit extended ioctl :)
And _yes_, it can be used to turn on/off binary-only callbacks.
Remember pwc - closed part can register callback and open part can
send message, or even closed part can register notification when
open part registers itself and begin to "trash the kernel".
I understand that it is not right way to include it is into the kernel,
but I personally do not understand how it is different 
from just extended ioctl. It was designed to be usefull and convenient,
and it is.
BTW, any binary-only module can _itself_ create netlink socket
with input callback. And that is all - it will be absolutely
the same as above.
One may consider connector as yet-another-netlink-helper.
