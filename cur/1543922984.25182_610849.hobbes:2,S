If 2) is keeping the API semantics then 2.

2) keeps everything in order. Let everything be as it is today unless
numactl sets the new.

I am getting confused as to which alternative means what.

Tough. The API needs to remain stable. We can only change it through an 
additional flag that enables the relativeness and the folding the way you 
want it. libnuma may set the flag on its own without the user having to do 
anything.

Hmmm.. The alternative is to add new set/get mempolicy functions.
