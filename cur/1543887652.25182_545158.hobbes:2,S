Couple more issues...

I would strongly suggest you used (0, PAGE_CACHE_SIZE) for the range, and
have your nopage function DTRT.
Minor issue: you can just check for `if (!page->mapping)` for truncation,
which is the usual signal to tell the reader you're checking for truncate.
Then you can remove the comment...

Rather than add this (not always correct) comment about the VM workings, I'd
just add a directive in the page_mkwrite API documentation that the filesystem
is to return 0 if the page has been truncated.
