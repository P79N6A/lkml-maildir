OK, scratch that, I think I know what happens.
shutdown() puts the device into D3 and then kexec relies on the device's
current_state being PCI_UNKNOWN so that pci_restore_bars() is called when
pci_set_power_state() runs for the first time.  This looks fragile, but I don't
know how to fix it cleanly at the moment and I can see this can also happen
in some other cases.  My bad.
Linus, please revert commit 98e6e286d7b01deb7453b717aa38ebb69d6cefc0
(PCI PM: Register power state of devices during initialization), because it
breaks the mechanism by which pci_restore_bars() is called during
initialization if the device is initially in D3.
Thanks,
Rafael
