maybe I've been unclear, but here's how e1000 detects link changes:
1) by checking every 2 seconds in the watchdog by reading PHY registers
2) by receiving an interrupt from the NIC with the LSI bit in the interrupt 
control register
if the link is down to start with, the watchdog will obviously spot a 'link up' 
change since it doesn't use any interrupts.
The link interrupt (LSI) is a generic interrupt that comes over the same vector 
(be it MSI or not) as RX interrupts, and in your case doesn't arrive at all, 
which should be demonstrateable if you set e.g. the watchdog interval to 30 
seconds and unplug the cable - the driver won't spot the link change until the 
watchdog fires a lot later than you unplugged the cable.

that would be a good start, but I still think that you might have a broken 
bridge on that system. Anyway, thanks for digging into this.
