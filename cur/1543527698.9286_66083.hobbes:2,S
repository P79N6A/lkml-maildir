right.  But the address that did the querying is not in the same subnet as
the address it was asking for.  With BSDI For example, it will not respond
to an ARP request unless the address you are asking for is in the same
subnet/cidr as the address you are asking from............they say this is
a security measure and brought up its how the rfc's say it should
be...........I am not saying that is correct, I was just trying to get the
bottom line......thanks
