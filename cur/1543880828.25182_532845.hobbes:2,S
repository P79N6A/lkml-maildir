While this looks fine, it seems that clear_huge_page() and
clear_mapping_page() could share a common helper. I also note that
clear_huge_page() calls cond_reched() and this doesn't which may be the
type of different behavior we want to avoid.
That said, if this goes ahead, it might be an excuse to look at using
ramfs as the basis for hugetlbfs instead of it's current approach. I
believe using ramfs for hugepages is something that wli wants anyway.

I suppose I'll see where this is used later in the patchset. It might be
easier to review if these helpers are introduced at the point they are
used.Not super-sure
