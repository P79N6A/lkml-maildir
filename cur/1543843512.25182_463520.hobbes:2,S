The parallel that springs to mind here is C++ kernel components 'I
promise to only use the good parts', then next week someone else adds
another pile in a worse place. Once the points are in we will never
get rid of them, look at how long it took to get rid of devfs :( In
addition it is guaranteed that people will not be able to agree on
which points to put where, despite the claim that there will be only
30 points - sorry, I am not buying that, we have plenty of evidence to
show the opposite.
I looked at the old LTT code a while ago and it was pretty appalling,
maybe LTTng is better, but I can't say the old code gave me a warm
fuzzy feeling.
