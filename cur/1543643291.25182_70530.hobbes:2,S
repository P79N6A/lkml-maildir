I'll ask that, too. Not because I doubt you have a good reason, but
because it doesn't jump out at me. I would like the CPU to go to the
process most likely to start an i/o and block, so the CPU hog can run
while the i/o takes place, because that seems to get the highest overlap
of CPU and i/o. I assume the current scheduler that as one of the goal,
clearly not the only one.
A few words of clarification would be educational.
