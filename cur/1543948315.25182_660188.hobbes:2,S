You got the point exactly right John. :)
The special "problem" about this is that the b44 driver, which _seems_
to have nothing to do with b43, registers the b43 PCI IDs.
(This is just for convenience. See the comment in the header of
b43_pci_bridge.c for details).
So if you use the b44 driver, but also want to use the bcm43xx driver,
you have to load the bcm43xx driver first to make it probe before
b44 registers the b43 PCI IDs.
The bcm43xx driver is not broken _at_ _all_. In fact, its code did not
even slightly change since ages.
I do see the issue, but I don't feel like changing the complicated SSB
KConfig stuff (it has lots of weird dependencies) to fix this bug
that is actually trivial to work around. Besides that, how many people
do we have, which do have a b44 card plus a bcm4311 rev 1 (there are _LOTS_
of revisions of the 43xx hardware)?
So I'd rather fix b43 to work on the card. See the patch I just sent.
