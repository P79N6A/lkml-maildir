Hi,
	it looks like whenever we write a partial block which 
doesn't exist in the buffer cache, ext2_file_write() (and
possibly the write functions of other filesystems) directly
reads that block from the block device without checking if
it is present in the page cache. in that case we can avoid a
read and do a memcpy instead, with a function very similar
to update_vm_cache(). 
	This behaviour would severely affect applications
doing small writes on areas which they (or someone else)
has already done a read() or mmap-faulted into the page
cache. The question is, are there any significant applications
which do this ? It's very easy to tickle this problem:
write a program which reads 1024 bytes, lseeks -1024,
writes a byte and lseeks 1023. Running this program on a
486/100 MHz, 16 MB RAM, 64 MB file gives the following
0.96user 48.19system 5:14.41elapsed 15%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (16482major+11minor)pagefaults 0swaps
plain 2.2.3
1.25user 44.00system 1:37.11elapsed 46%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 0maxresident)k
0inputs+0outputs (16441major+11minor)pagefaults 0swaps
2.2.3 patched to workaround the above problem.
Of course, typical UNIX programs/shell jobs don't indulge in
this kind of behaviour. General workstation usage (X,
kernel compiles etc.) for a day caused only 32 unnecessary
reads. So unless there are any specific application categories
which require this I guess it's not worth the trouble to patch.
Anyone working on a VM revamp or buffer/page cache unification ?
