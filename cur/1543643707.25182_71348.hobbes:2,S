Hi 
In userspace -- is there any way I can, by only knowing the interface
name (e.g. eth0), determine which PCI device it belongs to? Any bright
ideas? 
(BTW: I've tried using the SIOCGIFMAP ioctl -- which leaves me with a
base_addr and irq, but I couldn't get these matched uniquely with
/proc/bus/pci/devices) 
Thanks 
Ole André
