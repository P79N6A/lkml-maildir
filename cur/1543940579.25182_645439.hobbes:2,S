I wouldn't quite say that. I wasn't going to comment, but...personally,
I actually disagree with the assertions that ndiswrapper isn't causing
proprietary code to link against GPL functions in the kernel (how is
an NDIS implementation any different than a shim layer provided to
load a graphics driver?), but I wasn't trying to make that point.
Rusty - shall we just move the taint to post symbol resolution?
