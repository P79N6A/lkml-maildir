Subject: [PATCH] ServeRAID driver doesn't compile
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2002/7/17/253

In 2.5.26, the ServeRAID driver still doesn't compile correctly, you 
get these from the vmlinux link operation:
drivers/built-in.o(.data+0xc4f4): undefined reference to `local 
symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
drivers/built-in.o(.data+0xc574): undefined reference to `local 
symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
drivers/built-in.o(.data+0xc5f4): undefined reference to `local 
symbols in discarded section .text.exit'
This patch makes them go away and appears to be the correct fix.
