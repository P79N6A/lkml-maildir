1) This is arm specific.  Do any other arches want to provide access to  
leds?  Why should they implement some different api?
2) What happens when you have more than four leds?  or 3 dual color leds?
3) no way to read the current status of the led. (could be added to read  
from /sys/devices/system/leds/leds0 or something)
4) really wierd in-kernel api...  The led is associated with a machine,  
when that sometimes doesn't make sense; code duplication for the same  
harware drivers.  As an example, the led device on the Sharp Zauruses are  
all the same... exact same code to control the led.  Except one model is  
sa1100 and two are pxa based, so leds-collie.c and leds-poodle.c are  
exactly the same, except to be registered in the associated leds.c for that  
mach.  This model, instead of associating leds with a specific machine make  
it a device/driver concept like every other device in the kernel.
We can easily provide backwards compatibility with the arm led code.  I  
have a semi-working driver to register with ledsbase.c and call the  
leds_event function.  As well, the old /sys/devices/system/leds/leds0/event  
thing can also be emulated.

well, we could just create one attribute per led in /sys/devices/system/ 
leds/leds0/, but that breaks conceptally what sysfs is trying to provide...  
one device per attribute?  4 devices controlled by ONE attribute?
