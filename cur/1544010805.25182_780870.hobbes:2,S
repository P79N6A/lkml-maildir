We are fixing this particular race, so open code and comment can document
the problem clearer.
And this wrapper shouldn't be used by other cgroup users, if one needs to
do these checks, he should have a reason and comment is needed to explain
what's happening.
Also, I can't think out an appropriate name..

But non-populated means the directory isn't filled up with control files,
this function name doesn't indicate if the dir dentry itself is valid or not..
