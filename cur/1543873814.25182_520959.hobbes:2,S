Understood, but then you need to make that comment a single line :)
The way Linux code prefers comments (like the code itself actually
prefers it!) is single line comments stay on a single line, and
multiline comments are always block.
So it's either:
   /* my little comment here */
or 
   /*
    * This comment, although small and to the point, does span multiple
    * lines and regardless, needs to be a block comment.
    */
I guess it just makes it easier on the eyes when everything conforms and
others need to look at / maintain your code.
