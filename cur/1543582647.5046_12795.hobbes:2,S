For an incomplete subset of chipsets. Serverworks doesn't work correctly for
a start (see the threads relating to having to kill the Serverworks fixup code
and rely on the BIOS to see all the PCI busses on larger systems). Of course,
this is due to Serverworks refusal to release documentation (yes, I've heard
the excuses regarding protection of IP), and it's a worrisome. What else are
we potentially failing to setup on this chipset ?
