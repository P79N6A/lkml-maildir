i'm going to kick myself for this, but:
any hints on where to get started on moving bttv over to the new memory
routines? i'll start by reading the source diffs between a few files, but
someone explaining what happened might be more effecient. i have
approximately no free time this week, but i _need_ tv back. i'm american,
we're all addicts, you know.
Alan: and if i manage to get this crap working, can you please apply my
patch this time? ;^)
