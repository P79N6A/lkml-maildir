Pavel, you really should _listen_ when someone else is talking about the
same things in different implementations. suspend2 has this feature
(nice graphical progress bars in userspace) for a long time now and it's
compatible with the fedora kernels.
Why don't you and Nigel (of suspend2) can just work together on this ?
It's a shame that much work is wasted in duplicated effort.
