2.4.20pre7 (aic7xxx 6.2.8) that I initially saw the lockups with was
compiled with MMAPIO undefined. 2.4.21-jam1 (aic7xxx 6.2.36) and 2.4.22pre8
(aic7xxx 6.2.36) had it defined (the default). All of the three locked up
the same way. Hence, I think it's unlikely MMAPIO is the culprit.
However, I just realized that all of those kernel were compiled with fairly
dubious gcc, version 2.96-85. I just compiled otherwise identically
configured 2.4.21-jam1 with gcc-3.2.1-2. It'll take some time to tell
whether this cures it. This is my main suspect now.

The lockups may be completely unrelated to aic7xxx and the crashes on boot
that I posted kernel logs of. I don't know.
