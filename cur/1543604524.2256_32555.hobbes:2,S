Ugh... When do you free them?

Precisely.  I think that on the block side we are fairly close to
reasonable one - at least I see how to get there.  Character devices
are nastier - especially with the lack of common point on ->release()
path (->f_op reassignment done by various subsystems).  Once we have
that, the rest will be pretty easy (there will be a separate issue
with per-disk objects, e.g. for serialization between open() and
BLKRRPART, but that's almost independent).
However, amount of mechanical work is going to be large - especially
if ->i_rdev becomes dev_t.  That means changing types of a lot of local
variables in drivers and I'd rather leave that to 2.5.  It _does_ break
source compatibility, and that makes it -CURRENT material.
