Sorry for all the waste of your time, but
I'm afraid this is entirely bogus, as Kamezawa-san has kindly
discovered for us (in: Re: mmotm 2009-01-12-16-53 uploaded thread).
The code was correct before, there was no shifting issue, and you
cannot muck around with the vm_pgoff of a vma like this patch does.
Thank Nick for the CONFIG_DEBUG_VM BUG_ON which warns that this
patch has inadvertently made these stack pages unreclaimable
(because their indexes no longer match up with vm_pgoff).
All there is here is a cosmetic issue: we're used to seeing 8-hex-
digit offsets in the /proc/pid/maps of a 32-bit process.  Though it
could perfectly well mmap() a large file from a very high offset and
show more hex digits there, couldn't it?
Because this 32-bit process has been started by a 64-bit kernel, it
started off working with the 64-bit stack position before moving into
place, and that happens to get reflected in the final vm_pgoff.
You prefer only to see 8-hex-digit offsets for anonymous vmas of 32-bit
processes?  If so, then perhaps Ying Han could supply a cosmetic patch
for /proc/pid/maps to mask off the upper bits in that case.
