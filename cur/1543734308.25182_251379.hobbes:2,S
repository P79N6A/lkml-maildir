With some work it could be tuned at boot-time.

There are nontrivial differences in the optimal batching factor
dependent on the distribution of hold times and interarrival times. The
strongest dependencies of all are on ratio of the lock transfer time to
the interarrival time and the lock transfer time itself. These appear
routinely in numerous odd places in the expressions for expected
response time, and the latter often as a constant of proportionality.

It's unclear what you're estimating the size of. PAGEVEC_SIZE of 62
yields a 512B pagevec, for 4 cachelines exclusive to the cpu (or if
stack allocated, the task). The pagevecs themselves are not shared,
so the TLB entries for per-cpu pagevecs span surrouding per-cpu data,
not other cpus' pagevecs, and the TLB entries for stack-allocated
pagevecs are in turn shared with other stack-allocated data.

mapping->tree_lock is affected as well as zone->lru_lock. The workload
obviously has to touch the relevant locks for pagevecs to be relevant;
however, the primary factor in the effectiveness of pagevecs is the
lock transfer time, which is not likely to vary significantly on boxen
such as the OSDL STP machines. You should use a workload stressing
mapping->tree_lock via codepaths using radix_tree_gang_lookup() and
getting runtime on OSDL's NUMA-Q or otherwise asking SGI to test its
effects, otherwise you're dorking around with boxen with identical
characteristics as far as batched locking is concerned.
