This thundering herd "problem" can fairly easily be programmed around
without messing around with the select() semantics by letting everything
but one process wait on a semaphor instead of on the select, this ensures
only two proceses wake up, the one waiting on the select, and (shortly
after) the first one waiting on the semaphore once the first one releases
it. 
This is part of the way Apache gets around thundering herds.
Of cause this can be seen as yet another hack to get around a problem in
the API, but changing a standard API is very definitely not the way to
solve problems, that only deadends in something like the way Windows
breaks applications left and right every time they "upgrade" the system.
