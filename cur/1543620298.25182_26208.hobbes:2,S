What about people who send you occasionnal patches, and happen to
be using Bitkeeper too ?
Do you still prefer only regular patches from them or you would
accept something generated with a:
	bk send -d torvalds@transmeta.com
(which prepends the bk changeset with the equivalent in unified diff 
format, so you can have the best of both worlds) ?
In the latter case Documentation/SubmittingPatches should be updated
with the proper BitKeeper syntax to use etc.
