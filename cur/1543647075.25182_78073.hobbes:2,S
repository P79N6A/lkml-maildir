And extending the metaphor, even racecar drivers use a steering wheel and gas 
pedal.  (They almost always prefer manual transmission over auto, and like to 
have a tachometer in their display, but those are options for regular drivers 
in normal cars too.)
There are 8 zillion strange adjustable things in a racecar, but that's for 
the pit crew to deal with, not the driver.
The linux kernel is the same.  Going into the source is definitely something 
the pit crew is responsible for, or your friendly neighborhood garage 
mechanic, or the guy who likes to change his own oil on the weekends.
"make menuconfig" isn't anywhere near steering wheel simplicity, but the last 
time we had this discussion "aunt tillie" wandered through, which effectively 
ended rational debate if you ask me.  (She's like that, I suppose. :)  Still, 
cluttering it up any more than strictly necessary probably isn't a good thing.
90% of learning to deal with the linux kernel is learning to separate out the 
stuff you're interested in from the bits you can safely ignore at the moment, 
so you can tackle things one piece at a time.  (For some value of "safely", 
anyway... :)
