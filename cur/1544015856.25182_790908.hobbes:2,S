| Hi Ingo.
| 
| We have recently introduced a lot of new warnings for our
| userspace headers.
| 
| Try to do a "make headers_check" and enjoy...
| 
| Are there any chance you could ask one of your helpers to
| start to look into the x86 specific ones?
| 
| If we get x86 clean this would create more incentive to
| make the generic clean too.
| 
| I had originally planned to attack the generic headers
| (include/linux/*) but I'm faced by reality after my
| vacation and has almost no spare time for the time being.
| 
| I already fixed the sparc headers but that is not 
| visible compared to x86 (the fixes was btw easy).
| 
| I can try to help by doing a few reviews in the
| beginning but I need to fix kbuild stuff first where
| I have a few serious issues pending. And lacks time...
|

Sam, I hope to find some spare time for this
tomorrow (it's night here). At least in one
moment headers_check assume that CONFIG is exported
into user space even being bound by pure C comments.

CONFIG_NODES to userspace where it is not valid

Just a note.
