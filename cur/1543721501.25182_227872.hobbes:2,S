And please tell me -- the point of journalling is to reduce fsck times
upon failure - particularly important if you have 14TB of raid (yes,
we had to fsck after a recent downtime, and it had been > 180 days -
took half the day). What is the point of journalling if you have to
compare and restore against backup everytime the power fails? This is
slower than a mere fsckage.
FYI, I think jfs has the same behaviour as xfs - I do notice a
distinct lack of usage of a /lost+found, which has been important to
me in the past.

Sounds about right :)
Next time I reformat/get a new drive, I'll be going back to ext3 -
never caused any problems for me.
