Yes we (IBM Linux Technology Center RAS Team) are.  If you have
ideas/concerns/requirements please make them known. We are at the point of
deciding what to attack. We have other dumping technologies on other OSs we
could model a Linux enhancement on. There are many things we'd like to see
incorporated, the question is how not to boil the ocean. Here are some of
the ideas we are thinking about:
Multi-process/multi-thread
Customisable memory ranges/object types
   Code/Stack/Dynamic allocations
   System Objects:
      File-system
      Memory Management
      Device Management
      Process/Task Management
      (Physical memory ranges)
Multiple (non-fatal) Triggers:
   Trap
   Command
   API
   Automated (via DProbes)

Please let me know (by mail) otherwise I may take a look, since it
doesn't appear to be a _huge_ problem any longer, and it's one of the
things users keep bitching at us about when using our debugger :-(
Thanks
