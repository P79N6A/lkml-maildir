	Memory detection works fine on my Abit BH6 with Bios HN.  Is your memory
all there when you tell linux how much there is?  Some of the BH6 motherboards
were reported to have various defects including problems with some
combinations of dimms not working in the various dimm slots.  Also, the bios
has a setting for "OS Select For DRAM > 64MB".  The 2 choices are for OS2 and
Non-OS2.  I don't know if this affects linux or not, but you may want to check
and see what it is set to.
