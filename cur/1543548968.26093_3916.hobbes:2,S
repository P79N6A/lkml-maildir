AFAIK, Dell wrote these drivers themselfs and they are unwilling to release
the source.  The Perc controller (if you look inside the box) is made by
adaptec.  Personally I think this raid controller is crap (well, under linux
anyway.).  We have a server at work with this controller and writing to the
raid array is slow.  This one was so slow infact, that you couldn't do
anything on the machine.  (probably badly written driver)
