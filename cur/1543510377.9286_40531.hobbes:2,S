I've putted at 
http://bazar.conectiva.com.br/~marcelo/rwsem-2.3.18ac7.patch
 
a patch which adds read-write mutexes to the kernel.
I've also modified kernel/sys.c uts_sem semaphore to be a rwsem structure
and use read/write_down read/write_up in the files which use it.
The patch is not very well tested so there may be serious bugs in the
code. I'd like to someone with a SMP machine to test it.
Comments/patches are very welcome.
