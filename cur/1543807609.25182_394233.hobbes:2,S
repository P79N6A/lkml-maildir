?
The oom-killer is invoked from the page allocator.  A hugetlb pagefault
won't use the page allocator.  So there shouldn't be an oom-killing on
hugepage exhaustion.
I think this comment is just wrong:
		/* Logically this is OOM, not a SIGBUS, but an OOM
		 * could cause the kernel to go killing other
		 * processes which won't help the hugepage situation
		 * at all (?) */
A VM_FAULT_OOM from there won't cause the oom-killer to do anything.  We
should return VM_FAULT_OOM and let do_page_fault() commit suicide with
SIGKILL.
