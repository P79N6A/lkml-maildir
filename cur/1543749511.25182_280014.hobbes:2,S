I have mentioned earlier and Bart knows it.
I use 2.4.28
+ ebtables-brnf-8_vs_2.4.28.diff
+ U32 patch from patch-o-matic-ng-20040621.tar.bz2
+ patch for br_netfilter.c made by Bart to find out why kernel panic happens(it was a few
  letters ago)
  All patches has applies cleanly.
  U32 doesn't affect on br_netfilter.c
[root@linux kernel]# md5sum linux-2.4.28.tar.bz2

If the problem will continue appear and will not be solved an any
way, of course, I will use 2.6 kernel, now I am not ready to use it.
