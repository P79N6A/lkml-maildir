I have Debian bugreports saying that it's not only IBM laptop drives.
It happens on Seagate, Samsung, Maxtor as well.
See 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=110804&repeatmerged=yes
Note that the final fix (putting the drives in standby mode) is not
discussed in this bug report - I experimented first with turning off
the write cache in the shutdown scripts which kind of worked but
feels not quite right - you might need just enough write activity
after that to completely flush the on-disk cache.
Mike.
