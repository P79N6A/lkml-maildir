Not at all. Let me (one process) read 1MB from /dev/urandom,
and analyze it. If I can break SHA-1, I'm able to predict *future*
/dev/urandom output, expecially if I keep draining bits from /dev/random.
And even if it was not the case, you don't necessary need to read
the PRNG output *in order* to be able to guess it. Every N bits you
read, you learn more about its internal state.
Despite that, you tells you I'm not able to capture outgoing network
packets as well?
