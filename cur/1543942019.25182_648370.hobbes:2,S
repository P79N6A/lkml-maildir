I won't even consider pulling it unless it's offered as a separate tree, 
not mixed up with other things. At that point I can give a look.
That said, I explained to Ingo why I'm not particularly interested in it. 
I don't think that "developer-centric" debugging is really even remotely 
our problem, and that I'm personally a lot more interested in 
infrastructure that helps normal users give better bug-reports. And kgdb 
isn't even _remotely_ it.
So I'd merge a patch that puts oops information (or the whole console 
printout) in the Intel management stuff in a heartbeat. That code is 
likely much grottier than any kgdb thing will ever be (Intel really 
screwed up the interface and made it some insane XML thing), but it's also 
fundamentally more important - if it means that normal users can give oops 
reports after they happened in X (or, these days, probably more commonly 
during suspend/resume) and the machine just died.
kgdb? Not so interesting. We have many more hard problems happening at 
user sites, not in developer hands.
