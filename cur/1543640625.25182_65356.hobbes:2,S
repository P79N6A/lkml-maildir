BTW that host protected area message is pretty silly. It gives
the appearance that perhaps the BIOS has issued a SET MAX ADDRESS
when in fact, all the message is doing is enumerating the drive's
capabilities (duplicating what 'hdparm -I' does).  At the
minimum, this message should be changed to something more like:
    printk("%s: host protected area supported: %s\n", 
	    drive->name, (flag==1)? "no" : "yes");
Personally, I think we should lose the message entirely.  If
someone want to know what their drive can do, they can ask
hdparm and get a full listing,
 -Erik
