Looking at the above, I have no way of telling what the actual bug is, nor
have I any way of telling what the consequences would be of not having this
patch in 2.6.22.  Nor can I tell whether we want it in 2.6.21.x.
I probably _could_ work this out, and kinda did with a bit of list-trolling
(verdict: needed in 2.6.22) but please, take care to describe the
importance of a patch in the changelog?
Thanks.
