Subject: CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED: setting sched_min_bal_int_shares to 2000?

I recently enabled CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED just to play with it, and I
noticed by default it causes a fair number of wakeups when running on
battery.   A quick read-through of the sources showed that this could
easily be fixed by doing:
echo 2000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_min_bal_int_shares
Aside from mostly disabling the CPU load balancing, is this likely to
cause any massive problems?
Any reason why we shouldn't perhaps do this automatically when we run on
battery (not necessarily as a kernel thing, but as a userspace policy
measure)?
Thanks,
