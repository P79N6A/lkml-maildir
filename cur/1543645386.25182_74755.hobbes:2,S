Fair enough, short-term.  But what your patch is really saying
is "this code stinks".
We need to lose all those open-coded accesses to vm_area_cachep,
give that cache a constructor and possibly write some helper
functions.  To lose all this fragile "did I remember to
initialise everything and has anyone added any more fields
since I wrote that code" gunk.
