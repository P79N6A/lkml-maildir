Well it seems like the Right Thing To Do anyway to make it all 64bit clean ;-)

Can we not print them onto the console if they're normal then?

I think the card took itself offline at this point, so it smells like a bug.
That's only been happening recently though (I've only noticed in the last

OK, will try to grab that.

Sure, send me the patch, these boxes bring out races like dying rich aunts
bring out friendly relatives. And I have a cabinet drawer full of starfire
cards ;-)
