Subject: [PATCH] x86_64: make amd quad core 8 socket system not be clustered_box v2
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/24/11

quad core 8 socket system will have apic id lifting.the apic id range could
be [4, 0x23]. and apic_is_clustered_box will think that need to three clusters
and that is large than 2. So it is treated as clustered_box.
and will get
Marking TSC unstable due to TSCs unsynchronized
even the CPUs have X86_FEATURE_CONSTANT_TSC set.
this patch will check if the cpu is from AMD.
