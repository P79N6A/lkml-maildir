I agree about the ugly bit :-(.

Actually I expect it to become struct of two members, system-state and
bus-specific state. That seems small enough to pass by value.

I can do that... but it will break compilation of every driver in the
tree. I can fix drivers I use and try to fix some more will sed, but
it will be painfull (and pretty big diff, and I'll probably miss some).
Should I do that?
