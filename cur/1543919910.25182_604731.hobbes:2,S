So, I don't actually know what you're looking for, but of the 140 occasions
that .compat_ioctl is implemented in Linus' tree, I can't find another one
that actually uses this form. So, writing a shared implementation doesn't pick
off any low hanging fruit. Now, it's possible that some of the other implementations
could be reduced to this form - but for now, it seems the answer to your question
is 'one' in either case. :-)
