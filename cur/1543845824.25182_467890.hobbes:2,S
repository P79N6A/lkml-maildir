Personally, I'd prefer the children count to be separate, something  
like:
buffer += sprintf(buffer, "Threads:\t%d (%d children, %d total)",  
num_threads, num_children, num_threads + num_children);
That would be rather nice, indeed.
Also, next time, make sure that linux-kernel is CC'd, not BCC'd.
