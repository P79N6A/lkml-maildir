Hi.
I've been having problems with 'bk pull' execution when using kernels
after the 2.6.8/2.6.8.1 releases. My machine has 192M of memory and 100M
of swap, so I believe that the memory requirements for using BK to keep
up with the kernel is sufficient, and when the machine is running with a
2.6.8.1 kernel I can 'bk pull' even if X windows is running. With the
2.6.9 and 2.6.10-rc kernels, BK bombs out with out-of-memory errors once
the repository checking begins. I've run the 'bk pull' under the newer
kernels without X running, as well as shutting down various daemons, and
still things fail with memory errors.
Here's a snippet of /var/log/messages under 2.6.10-rc1 when a
'bk pull' fails:
kernel: oom-killer: gfp_mask=0xd2
kernel: DMA per-cpu:
kernel: cpu 0 hot: low 2, high 6, batch 1
kernel: cpu 0 cold: low 0, high 2, batch 1
kernel: Normal per-cpu:
kernel: cpu 0 hot: low 22, high 66, batch 11
kernel: cpu 0 cold: low 0, high 22, batch 11
kernel: HighMem per-cpu: empty
kernel: 
kernel: Free pages:         420kB (0kB HighMem)
kernel: Active:45877 inactive:64 dirty:0 writeback:0 unstable:0 free:105 slab:1451 mapped:45846 pagetables:195

kernel: DMA: 1*4kB 0*8kB 0*16kB 1*32kB 0*64kB 0*128kB 0*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB 0*2048kB 0*4096kB = 36kB
kernel: Normal: 0*4kB 0*8kB 0*16kB 0*32kB 0*64kB 1*128kB 1*256kB 0*512kB 0*1024kB 0*2048kB 0*4096kB = 384kB
kernel: HighMem: empty
kernel: Swap cache: add 110618, delete 108152, find 38132/44306, race 0+1
The machine used to have only 128M of memory, and 'bk pull' worked
albiet _very_ slowly as the machine went heavily into swap space usage,
but it seemed that once the number of files went over 20,000 or so I had
to add more memory, and then once again 'bk pull' worked without any
problem.
I realize that there have been many, many changes to the kernel between
2.6.8 and the current BK, but my configuration for my builds has
remained mostly the same, so I am at somewhat of a loss to figure out
just where the extra memory usage is coming from.
Is there a known set of changes that explain the additional memory
requirements?
