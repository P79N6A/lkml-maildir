If you look at the Intel manual 24319202 page 44 (TF bit), it clearly says 
that the trap is generated on the instruction that follows the IRET. In 
the same doc, at page 145, it also says that the return address seen by 
the trap handler is the one following the trapped instructuion (INT#1 is a 
trap). Ideally, I'm with you in expecting a full trace on all the 
instructions (out of INTs), but this doesn't seem to be what documented.
On the kernel side, this would be pretty much solved by issuing a ptrace 
op, with a modified EIP (+2) on return from a syscall (if in single-step 
mode).
