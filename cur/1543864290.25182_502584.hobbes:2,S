I absolutely disagree with you Eric, and I think you're being
rediculious.
If the hypervisor doesn't control the MSI PCI config space
register writes, this allows the device to spam PCI devices
which belong to other domains.
It's a freakin' reasonable design trade off decision, get over
it! :-)
Yes it can be done at the hardware level, and many hypervisor
based systems do that, but it's not the one-and-only true
way to implment inter-domain protection behind a single
PCI host controller.
