Subject: specifying a range of io for ide on boot

Here's the problem. I got a laptop that uses an io range for ide0 that
is 0x01f0 to 0x01f8 instead of ending on 0x01f7. According the
Documentation there is no way to specify the range of the ide, only the
start of the io. Can someone help? I think I can't use the UDMA because
of this.
The laptop is a Dell Latitude XPi P133ST which uses the CMD 643 chipset.
