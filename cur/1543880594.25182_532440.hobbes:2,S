As I mentioned, the rootfs is on reiser. So something in the boot up
scripts may trigger something that gets reiser to run through that path
with the wrong locking order. After the box is done booting, the dmesg
is clean. I then mount the ext3 fs and run the fio test, the lockdep
trace shows up immediately.
The distro is SLES9.
