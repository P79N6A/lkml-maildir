Subject: loopback hang in 2.4.0-test5

Linux 2.4.0-test5 on an Athlon 700, most features compiled as modules.
I created a 650Mb file, made an ext2 filesystem in it, and copied
a directory tree into this filesystem (mounted on /devfs/loop/0).
This worked the first time, but the last two times, the copy froze
partway through, and the tar process involved is immune to kill -9.
It's stuck in 'D' state.
dmesg shows no errors. Strace gives nothing. Ctrk-SysRq-K kills the process
(but didn't last time this happened). The hang does *not* happen in the
same part of the copy each time.
I don't know how to debug this further.
