Maybe when Linus' release is a bit closer to the USB tree I could help
with that.  Right now it's sufficiently divergent to make usb patches
against usbcore be rather helpful in general (though maybe not in that
particular case).  I'll certainly be glad to take a whack at that.

I think it's just been that way for ages, no changes.  It's actually
usb_disconnect(), not the hub driver, that goes top down, disconnecting
children only _after_ the parent is disconnected.  (Might be nice to
flag all devices as "dead" before disconnecting in such cases, but we
don't have a way to flag devices as "dead" AFAIK.  That'd make it easy
to fail new urb submissions for now-gone devices.)
If the current changes don't automagically make disconnection work
according to the device tree, something needs to change to make that
work correctly.  But I'm not sure what it'd be; seems like the converse
of the probe() changes you started.
