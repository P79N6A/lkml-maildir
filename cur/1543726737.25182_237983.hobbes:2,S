When processes can freely and transparently move around the cluster (at
exec time, fork time or during any system call), being able to
transparently access your controlling tty is pretty handy.  In 2.4 we
stack our CFS  on top of each node's devfs to give us naming of and
access to all devices on all nodes.  TBD on how will do this in 2.6.
