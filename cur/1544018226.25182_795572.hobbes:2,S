The patch below from Dave Chinner fixes it:

[XFS] Long btree pointers are still 64 bit on disk
On 32 bit machines with CONFIG_LBD=n, XFS reduces the
in memory size of xfs_fsblock_t to 32 bits so that it
will fit within 32 bit addressing. However, the disk format
for long btree pointers are still 64 bits in size.
The recent btree rewrite failed to take this into account
when initialising new btree blocks, setting sibling pointers
to NULL and checking if they are NULL. Hence checking whether
a 64 bit NULL was the same as a 32 bit NULL was failingi
resulting in NULL sibling pointers failing to be detected
correctly. This showed up as WANT_CORRUPTED_GOTO shutdowns
in xfs_btree_delrec.
Fix this by making all the comparisons and setting of long
pointer btree NULL blocks to the disk format, not the
in memory format. i.e. use NULLDFSBNO.
