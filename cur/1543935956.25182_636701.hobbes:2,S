Hello and happy new year 2008.
In drivers/usb/serial/usb-serial.c there is a function (fixup_generic / 
set_to_generic_if_null) that hooks null fops to the generic driver ones.
The drivers/usb/serial/generic.c implements throttle, unthrottle and 
resume, but those aren't used by default in fixup_generic. Is there any 
reasons ? Could we submit a patch for that ?
Thank you for your help.
