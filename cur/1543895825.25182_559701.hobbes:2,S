I see.  Try 'modprobe logic', it worked for me years ago ;-) :-D

Which is why I said it was funny, because your inference chain stated
*exactly* (with an implied "for the developers") that it did.
Do you understand what an inference chain is?  A => B, as in A implies
B, which can also be read as A therefore B if A is known to hold.

This claim is false.
Tivoization is when hardware manufacturer takes copyleft software and
blocks updates by the user of the hardware.
No single law so far has shown an example that even resembled to
mandate copyleft software, and no contract could possibly establish a
condition like this.
Therefore, this claim is false.

There *is* circular logic is in place.
The initial premise of this fallacy is that anti-tivoization is bad
for the project.
This is used to conclude that licenses with such provisions should be
rejected.
This is then used to conclude that there are fewer developers who
would develop under such licenses.
Which is then used to conclude that anti-tivozation is bad for the
project.
