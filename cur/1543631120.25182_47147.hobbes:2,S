Hi,
I have written a USB device driver for the Linux kernel. For convenience I
am going to distribute it binary (rpm) in addition to the source. For
flexibility I intended to distribute the module without enabling the kernel
module version. However, depmod complains about unresolved symbols if I do
so (insmod/modprobe works of course). Is there a method of avoiding these
complaints by depmod or must I compile the driver with the kernel module
enabled (i.e. depmod is made this way).
Regards,
Svein
