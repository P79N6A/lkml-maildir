The fact that this is a percentage worries me.  When I was playing around
with this sort of thing several years ago I found that even
one-failure-per-thousand was a very high error rate for some testcases. 
This interface would force a minimum failure rate of one-per-hundred, which
is terribly high.
So I wonder if it'd be better to make this have units of "one millionth",
or simply make this tunable "1/(probability of failure)".  So setting it to
1,000,000 gives you one failure per million calls, on average.
