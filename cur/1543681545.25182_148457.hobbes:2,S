Several items in one email, more text than data, sorry. 
We've done an update of the Scalable Test Platform code, (rev 2.1.0)
 added a BK repo in addition to Sourceforge CVS, _we think STP is much better 
now.
The email to the test requestors is much improved, especially when the
kernel fails, and the results are more complete.
If you've tried us in the past, give it another go, send your cards, letters 
and
complaints on in. Also, any suggestions for new tests are most appreciated. 
Speaking of new tests, the AIM 7/9 rework, "reaim" is now running on STP and
code bundles are available. I hope to actually finish working on the code 
sometime
after OLS, please send patches/complaints to me.
There is a comparison graph and reports on 7 recent kernels at:

We are looking for some better ways of doing results via email. The reaim test
does produce lovely graphs, (if i do say so myself)
 which is why i'm sending pointers to Web pages.
We're talking about a magic-results-diff generator on 
stp-devel@lists.sourceforge.net,
please join the agru^H^H^H^H fun.
