I get slow all the time at home with a single CPU system.
At work I have a Dual p4 1.7Ghz XEON... Only when I keep both CPU's busy 
(example: make -j 4) does it happen on the dual machine. So basically if 
my dual machine is busy (one CPU has to be pegged or both are over 50% 
usage) I start getting very crappy xterm/gnome-terminal response.
I've been running each xterm/gnome-terminal with screen and when it 
starts grinding I detach/reattach.
