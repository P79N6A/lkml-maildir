No; compilation units have nothing to do with it, GCC can optimise
across compilation unit boundaries just fine, if you tell it to
compile more than one compilation unit at once.
What you probably mean is that the compiler has to assume any code
it cannot currently see can do anything (insofar as allowed by the
relevant standards etc.)

It most often is smart enough to see what compilation-unit-local
variables might be modified that way, though :-)
