My experience of NT has been about 90% on AUCC's systems, and about
10% on non-AUCC systems, and the conclusion I've had to draw from the
said experiences is that NT's stability is very much dependant upon
(a) careful selection of hardware to run it on, and (b) administrators
who actually know what they're doing. Unfortunately, AUCC doesn't
qualify on either count, hence the instability there.

HP almost certainly qualify on both counts - certainly the former, or
they wouldn't issue either of thos guarantees...

I'm not one to comment on NT in general since I don't believe I have
any experience of well set up NT systems, and an opinion biased by
only having experience on poorly set up NT systems isn't a fair one.
However, I feel that it IS fair to comment on the ease with which one
can get a stable set up under Linux compared with under NT, since on
the many systems I've set Linux up on, only 1 has ever been unstable,
and that was due to hardware misconfiguration, not to Linux.
On the other hand, my experience with NT tends to imply that it's
rather harder to achive a stable set up with it, simply because on the
four systems I've personally been involved in setting up NT on, all
four have been unstable, as have all but one of the other systems I've
seen NT running on...

That is a given in my book...
