Not sure what you mean with "delivering into the kprobes framework"
kprobes currently only uses printk which really isn't up to the 
task of any significant data delivery. The IBM people have relayfs
to solve this problem, eventually this should be probably
merged too. Without something like relayfs i don't see any way
to compete with dtrace.
