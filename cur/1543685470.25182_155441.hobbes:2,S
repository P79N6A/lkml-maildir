I am running 2.6.0-test2-mm5 on my thinkpad t21, and i have noticed
the following. If yenta_socket support is built as a module, and
loaded by the pcmcia init script, pcmcia cards already inserted are
recognized on startup. If you build yenta_socket support into the
kernel, these cards aren't seen, and require a replug to work.
