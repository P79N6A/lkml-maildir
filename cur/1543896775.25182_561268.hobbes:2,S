is still right. What I meant, at least by the end of that email, was
that he has the last word on trying to stop TiVo from using The Linux
Kernel. Each author can still go and stop them from using his part,
and the derivative work that is The Linux Kernel.
But that brings another question: what if TiVo decided to remove all
code from the complaining parts and rewrite them? that wouldn't be The
Linux Kernel anymore, but it would be a derivative work of all the
parts that don't disagree with Tivoization, but is that legal?
