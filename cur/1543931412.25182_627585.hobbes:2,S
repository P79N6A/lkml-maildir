Davide, Andrew,
I applied Davide's v3 patchset (sent into LKML on 25 Nov) against
2.4.24-rc3, and did various tests (all on x86).  Several tests
were done using the program at the foot of this mail.  Various others
were done by cobbling together bits of code that I haven't included
here.
In covering the tests I ran, and as a kind of proof of concept,
I'll treat the draft man page as the test spec.
I think I've found two bugs (look for the string "BUG" below), one
of which is a significant deviation from expected behavior.  See
the comments below.
Cheers,
Michael

> DESCRIPTION
>     These system calls create and operate on  a  timer  that
>     delivers  timer  expiration  notifications  via  a  file
>     descriptor.  They provide an alternative to the  use  of
>     setitimer(2) or timer_create(3), with the advantage that
>     the file  descriptor  may  be  monitored  by  select(2),
>     poll(2), and epoll(7).
>
>     The  use of these three system calls is analogous to the
>     use of timer_create(3), timer_settime(3), and timer_get-
>     time(3).   (There  is no analog of timer_gettoverrun(3),
>     since that functionality  is  provided  by  read(2),  as
>     described below.)
>
>   timerfd_create()
>     timerfd_create() creates a new timer object, and returns
>     a file  descriptor  that  refers  to  that  timer.   The

Verified.  I've tried creating various combinations of
CLOCK_REALTIME and CLOCK_MONOTONIC timers, both one shot
(it_interval is zero) and repeating (it_interval is non-zero),
and everything works as I would expect.

(Verified: see the ERRORS section of the man page, below.)

Disarming a timer works fine in my tests.

Verified: setting both  fields  of  new_value.it_value  to
zero disarms the timer.

I've tested intervals down to 1 nanosec, which seem to seems to
work as I would expect.  (But see the BUG reported below.)

Tested: after setting a CLOCK_REALTIME timer with the
TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME flag to expire at some time in the past with
a non-zero interval (e.g., setting 100 seconds in the past, with
a 5 second interval), read() from the file descriptor returns
the correct number of expirations (e.g., 20).
This seems a reasonable thing to do, I suppose.  However, while
playing around to test this, I found what looks like a bug (see
below).
BUG 1:
However, this test exposed what looks like a bug: if I set a
CLOCK_REALTIME clock to expire in the past, with a very small
interval, then the maximum number of expirations that can be
returned via read seems to be limited to 32 bits, even though
we have a 64-bit value for returning this information.
I haven't checked the kernel source to determine where this
bug is.
To demonstrate the bug use the program appended to this mail,
as follows:
# The following starts a CLOCK_REALTIME repeating timer with
# an interval of 1 microsecs (1000 nanosecs), with an initial
# expiration of just under 2^32 nanoseconds in the past.
# The '-a' flags says use TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME for timer_settime() calls.
# The 'r' command reads from the timerfd file descriptor.
$ ./timerfd_test -a -- -4290 0 0 1000
Initial setting for settime:   value=1197543860.000, interval=0.000
./timerfd_test> r           <-- type this immediately
Read: 4292190752            <-- nearly 2^32 expirations, as expected
$ ./timerfd_test -a -- -4290 0 0 1000
Initial setting for settime:   value=1197543900.000, interval=0.000
./timerfd_test> r           <-- type this after 5 secs
Read: 2992244               <-- Looks like the counter rolled over

BUG 2:
The last sentence does not match the implementation.
(Nor is it consistent with the behavior of POSIX timers.
And I *think* things did work correctly in the original
timerfd() implementation, but I have not gone back to check.)
Suppose that we set an absolute timer to expire 100 seconds
in the future.  Then according to this sentence of the man
page then each subsequent call to timerfd_gettime() should
retrun an itimerspec structure whose it_value steadily
decreases from 100 to 0 (when the timer expires).  (This
is the behavior in the analogous situation with POSIX timers
and with setitimer()/getitimer().)
However, the implementation of timerfd_gettime() always
returns the "time when the timer would next expire", and
this value depends on whether TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME was specified
when setting the timer.
Examples:
$ ./timerfd_test -a -- 100       # -a means TFD_TIMER_ABSTIME
Initial setting for settime:   value=1197550329.140, interval=0.000
./timerfd_test> g                <-- Calls timerfd_gettime()
(elapsed time=  1)
Current value:                 value=1197550329.140, interval=0.000
$ ./timerfd_test -- 100
Initial setting for settime:   value=100.295, interval=0.000
./timerfd_test> g
(elapsed time=  2)
Current value:                 value=18208.440, interval=0.000
In both of the above examples, the "value" retrieved by timer_gettime()
should be a number <= 100.
BUG 2a:
The bug described for timerfd_gettime() also applies for the
'curr_value' returned by a call to timerfd_settime().
>     The it_interval field returns the interval of the timer.
Verified: the above was true in all my tests.
>     If both fields of this  structure  are  zero,  then  the
>     timer  is set to expire just once, at the time specified
>     by curr_value.it_value.
Verified.

>     The file descriptor returned  by  timerfd_create()  sup-
>     ports the following operations:
>
>     read(2)
>            If  the  timer  has  already  expired one or more

>            an  unsigned 8-byte integer (uint64_t) containing
>            the number of  expirations  that  have  occurred.
Verified: each call to timerfd_settime() resets the "expiration
count" to 0, even if a previous setting of the timer had already
expired.

Not verified.  (No easy way to do that from userspace.)

Verified.  Reads from a dup(2)ed file descriptor, or a file
descriptor duplicated via a fork(2) can be used to read
expiration information.

Verified.  A timerfd file descriptor is preserved across an
exceve(), and continues to generate timer expirations that
can be read(2).

Currently, 'flags' must be zero.

Tested for timerfd_gettime() and timerfd_settime().
      An invalid file descriptor (i.e., a file descriptor that
      is not open) yields the error EBADF, as expected.
>     EINVAL fd  is  not  a  valid  timerfd  file  descriptor.
Tested for timerfd_gettime() and timerfd_settime().
      Passing a file descriptor that refers to an object other
      than a timerfd fails with the error EINVAL, as expected.

Tested for timerfd_settime().
     Specifying it_value.tv_nsec == 1000000000 or
     it_interval.tv_nsec == 1000000000 yields the error EINVAL,
     as expected.
