Somewhere between 2.2.11 and 2.2.12 em86 Intel emulator on Alpha
stopped working.  More precisely, the last kernel which I tried where
Intel Netscape still starts and works on Alpha is 2.2.11-ac3.
With 2.2.12 and those 2.2.13pre? I tried Netscape bombs without
opening its window and something of that sort is displayed on
a terminal (numbers are pretty close, even across kernel versions,
but not always the same):

There is no oops in log files and a bottom a 'strace' output looks
like that:
....
339   SYS_35(0x7, 0x7cffe2ac, 0x20, 0x1, 0x6016ce20) = 93
339   SYS_0(0x8, 0x7cffe194, 0, 0, 0x7cffdcdc) = 48
339   SYS_0(0x1, 0, 0x7ffff5d0, 0, 0x6016441c) = -1 EADDRINUSE (Address already in use)
339   SYS_0(0x1, 0x2000, 0x7ffff5d0, 0, 0x8448bc0) = 93
339   exit(8)                           = ?
339   --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---

339   --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---

339   <... sigreturn resumed> )         = ? (mask now ~[KILL STOP])
339   --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---
339   <... sigreturn resumed> )         = ? (mask now ~[KILL STOP])
339   --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---

339   --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---
339   <... osf_sigprocmask resumed> )   = -1 EDEADLOCK ((null))
.....
(this "unfinished - resumed" business repeated many times)
.....
339   sigreturn( <unfinished ...>
339   --- SIGALRM (Alarm clock) ---
339   <... sigreturn resumed> )         = ? (mask now ~[KILL STOP])
339   --- SIGBUS (Bus error) ---
339   write(2, "Signal 10 received\n", 19
and we are dead.
Anybody has any ideas what changed to cause that nasty effect
and how to fix it?
