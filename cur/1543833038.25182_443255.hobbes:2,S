Interesting.  In the short term I can see how that is a sane design.
In the long term that appears to require more hardware and be a
bottle neck on the number of irqs you can have so I don't expect
the current ppc model to be the long term one.  
Does the current ppc model give hypervisors more control then they
would get without going through an existing interrupt controller?

For the hypertransport case I have coded it this way and I think there
are good general cleanliness arguments for making this change to x86 as
well.  I think doing so actually winds up being less code.

So to be very concise what I did on the HT side is that I have a function:
arch_setup_ht_irq(struct pci_dev, int irq).
That is used by the arch code to setup the irq_chip handler and the rest.
There are helper functions:
void write_ht_irq_low(unsigned int irq, u32 data);
void write_ht_irq_high(unsigned int irq, u32 data);
u32 read_ht_irq_low(unsigned int irq);
u32 read_ht_irq_high(unsigned int irq);
That read and write the individual hypertransport irq routing values per irq.
I suspect this is the right general direction to move the msi code to.
The combination allows an architecture to take bus specific details into
an account, and have it's own irq handler methods.  At the same time
it is still the generic infrastructure controlling access to the
chip registers.
So I honest expect things like msi_ops to become an arch specific detail.
At the very least I think it is too early to start generalizing that way
if we really don't need to.
