If they are not interested in resource management and/or containers, i
do not think they need to pay.

Not at all. If the container they are interested in is guaranteed, I do
not see how apps running outside a container would affect them.

No, the reclaimer would free up pages associated with the don't care RGs
( as the user don't care about the resource made available to them).

The problem is that you can't do it with just limit.
