i'm certain that if you used a struct {} and filled in 3 fields rather 
than zeroing 64 bytes of memory, and doing 3 conversions to decimal ascii 
then you'd see a marked decrease in the overhead of this.  it's not clear 
to me why you need ascii here -- the rest of the existing bsd accounting 
code is not ascii (i'm assuming the purpose of the fork connector is for 
accounting).
