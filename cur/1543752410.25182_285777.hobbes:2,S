Of course it matters Linus - vendors need time to prepare their updates. You 
can't ignore that, and you can't "have nothing to do with it". 
You seem to dislike the way embargos have been done on vendorsec, fine. They can
be done on a different way, but you have to understand that you and Andrew
need to follow and agree with the embargo.
How you feel about having short fixed time embargo's (lets say, 3 or 4 days) ? 
The only reason for this is to have "time for the vendors to catch up", which 
can be defined by the kernel security office. Nothing more - no vendor politics
involved.
It is a simple matter of synchronization.
