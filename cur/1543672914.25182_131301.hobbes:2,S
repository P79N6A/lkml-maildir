Indeed, I have downloaded fresher docs and I have found the following:
"In earlier IA-32 processors and in some models of the Pentium 4
processor, this flag (bit 6) is reserved." (10.2.2)
Of course other sentences would imply that DAZ is associated
with SSE2 capability, but all Pentium 4 have SSE2, I believe.
Well, what a mess for a single bit!

AMD says more or less the same.

I don't believe that there is any, but that maybe some which don't
write anything, hence the requirement for clearing the area in the
DAZ detection algorithm.

Too expensive unless the mask is computed at boot time once and for 
all (thrashing half a kB  for a single 32 bit constant, sigh). I did 
not want to touch too many files in my patch, but it seems unavoidable. 
Now a last question, are there SMP systems in which one processor
supports DAZ and the other does not, just to complicate matters a
little more?
