Is this too late or not needed or what is it for? This function gets run
from the network layer's softirq and at this point we have a skbuff with
data that we want to process. The iscsi layer also does not allocate
memory for read or write IO in this path.
I think we would want to set this flag at a lower level. Something
closer to where the skbuf is allocated?
