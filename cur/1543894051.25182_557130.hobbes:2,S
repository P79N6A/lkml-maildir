And if Tivo did sell their crap in Germany, I bet, Harald had brought them 
down years ago (as he did in the "tivoized" Siemens router case). But Tivo 
doesn't (they started in the UK, and stopped doing so right after Harald 
unlocked that Siemens router ;-), and in the US, courts may think 
different. Or they rely that there simply is no Harald Welte in the US, who 
goes after the violators.
