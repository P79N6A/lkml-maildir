I believe you misspelled "ethtool".
While you're at it, why stop at 100Mb?  I believe you save even more power at 
10Mb, which is why WOL puts the card in 10Mb mode.  In my experience, you 
generally want either the maximum setting or the minimum setting when going for 
power savings, because of the race-to-idle effect.  Workloads that have a 
sustained fractional utilization are rare.  Right now I'm at home, hooked up to 
a cable modem, so anything over 4Mb is wasted, unless I'm talking to the box 
across the room, which is rare.
Talk to the NetworkManager folks.  This is right up their alley.
