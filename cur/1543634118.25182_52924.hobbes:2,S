Some earlier obsolete gcc versions had problems with empty types. This lead
to an #if based on the compiler version that added a dummy field
to spinlocks even for UP kernels. This made structure offsets of
structures with spinlocks change based on gcc version.
Should be long gone with recent compilers.
Still there are enough other variables to structure offsets depending 
on the configuration.
