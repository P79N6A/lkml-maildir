We are running SMP Linux 2.2.13pre4 + HJ Lu's knfsd patches on an
dual-PII box.  We are seeing this log message occasionally:
  09:15:17 kernel: nfs_dentry_delete: elaborate/try.curl: ino=7958611, count=2, nlink=1
(Of course, the file name and inode number vary.)
What does this mean?
I tried looking at the source, but I do not understand filesystem
internals well enough to know what this message is trying to tell me,
nor (more importantly) how bad the problem is.
Thanks in advance for any help...
