I just configured my SB AWE64 recently and had the same problem with the
wavetable, but it seems they have this pretty well documented because the
answer wasn't hard to find.
The biggest problem that I had was telling it which modules to load first
and which modules to load.
But when I look at my /dev/sndstat It is not same as what the HOWTO says.
Anyone else experience this?
All in all it took me almost a day to get everything working the way I want
it.
Sorry this doesn't to do with the modem problem :-(.
