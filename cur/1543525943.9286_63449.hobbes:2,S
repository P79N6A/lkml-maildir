hello
i think this is the 3rd or so posting regarding the AWE32 modules
with kernels greater than .42.. i get the following under .44 and
.45 (i havent tested .43) all the modules (sound, soundlow, soundcore,
uart401) load fine, the problem starts when loading the sb.o and the
awe_wave modules
i get this in the logs:
(loading sb.o dma16=5 io=0x220 mpu_io=0x330 irq=5 dma=1)
Soundblaster audio driver Copyright (C) by Hannu Savolainen 1993-1996
sb: dsp reset failed.
(loading awe_wave.o)
AWE32: not detected
i am back to 2.3.39 for the moment as 2.3.4[1,2] at least give me strange
behaviour: netscape core-dumps everytime i load it and the occasional X
crash.
this is the same kernel configuration i have been using since 2.3.29 all
went fine till the moment i started using the 2.3.40+ kernels.
one more thing i have noticed, this is *very* recent, and i dont know what
it means, i get this in the system log
KERNEL: assertion (dst!=NULL) failed at tcp_output.c(96):tcp_advertise_mss
usually it repeats the exact same message for 3 time
what does it mean?
thx
