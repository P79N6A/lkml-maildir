Well it used to be.  After 2.6.19 it can do the wrong thing for mapped
pages.  But it turns out that we don't feed it mapped pages, apart from
pagevec_strip() and possibly races against pagefaults.

The only callers are try_to_free_buffers(), truncate and a few scruffy
possibly-wrong-for-fsync filesytems which aren't being used here.
<spots a race in do_no_page()>
If a write-fault races with a read-fault and the write-fault loses, we forget
to mark the page dirty.
Something like this, but it's probably wrong - I didn't try very hard (am
feeling ill, and vaguely grumpy)
