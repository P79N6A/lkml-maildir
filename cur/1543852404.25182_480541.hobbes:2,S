The standard which all network drivers should use is:
module insertion:
	start in initial powerdown state
open:
	power up, bring up link
stop:
	bring down link
	return to powerdown state unless WOL is set.
	if doing WOL go to lowest power sensing state
suspend:
	same as stop
resume:
	same as open
module removal:
	stop already called so device should be in power down state.
Since suspend is basically same as stop, and resume is open
I am going to investigate doing suspend/resume in the network device layer
(unless subclassed by driver), so we can rip out the suspend/resume hook
from many network drivers. There will still be boards like sky2
that need own suspend/resume to deal with dual port etc.
