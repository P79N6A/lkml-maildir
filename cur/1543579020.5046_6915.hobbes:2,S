I was talking about a Mac running Mac OS.  I've tried change the SCSI ID of the
boot device, but this discussion was about adding devices.  On a Mac, I've
always been able to add devices, whether they be on an exiting SCSI or IDE bus,
or on a new bus, and not worry about the machine not booting.
I can't same the same about the PC.  Overall, the PC is just much more
sensitive to device changes than Macs are.  And I think it's because the Mac
BIOS and OS are just designed to handle this better.  The PC BIOS never had any
provision for a third-party boot device to annouce itself.
