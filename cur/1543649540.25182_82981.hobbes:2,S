Thats what I thought. Essentially, all projects are world rw if all users
have access to all projects.

As soon as everyone is in every group you get anonymous access.
You would also have the same result by putting all of the CVS files in
one group.
Or by just making the directories/files world rwx/rw.

Actually it depends on the implementation. I believe some of the ACL
specs on a directory can be specified to be inherited (I'll have to check
the POSIX ACL definitions, but I remember a number of capabilities
available on directories that didn't exist for files-- yup - It's called
a "default ACL" and can be used to set UGO access, protection
masking and user acess controls).
In the scenario above, I would most likey specify an ACL to
include specific groups of users. That way it wouldn't necessarily
be equivalent to a world rw access.
