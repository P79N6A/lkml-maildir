How about compressing all files in an initrd image individually and
storing them in memory in compressed form? Should be easy as long as
the image is read-only. I don't know if a read-write image is needed.
Or could we dump initrd altogether and access the boot drive directly
through a BIOS call? A 32->16 bit gate to call the BIOS interrupt should
be possible. Who cares about performance in the early stage of install?
IIRC such a driver did exist years ago, or the ELKS people might have
one. Of course, this would be x86 specific...
Please don't Cc: me, I *do* read this list.
