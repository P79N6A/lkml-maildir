Not technically true.  This doesn't make any guarantees about
fragmentation (even if in general it works pretty well).  To really
reduce fragmentation, then cluster allocation needs to be made smarter
so it goes looking for contiguous clusters when allocating, but that's
a task for a separate patch.  Please adjust your description.
Also, please briefly describe the testing that you've performed.

This printk is probably not needed, or at least make it a pr_debug()

Drop the printk() here.  It will cause a write to the system log
everytime userspace does an unnecessary fat_fallocate().  That becomes
a performance hit which I don't think we want.

Race condition.  The file is increased in size and then returned to
the original size if FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE is set, but the lock is
dropped then reobtained between increasing the size and restoring to
the original.  Another file operation can occur between the two
operations.  Badness!
However, digging further, when FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE is set, I don't
think fat_cont_expand() has the behaviour that we want to implement.
When that flag is set, I think we simply want to add clusters
associated with the file to the FAT.  We don't want to clear them or
map them into the page cache yet (that should be done when the
filesize is increased for real).
I believe a call to fat_allocate_clusters() is all that is needed in
this case.  Hirofumi, please correct me if I'm wrong.
Cheers,
g.
