In fact, that shouldn't be necessary as the relevant parsing code is
all in the one function in init/main.c and it already decodes the
values for most of those parameters and provides the relevant values
in separate structures for each parameter.
Personally, I'd like to see all punctuation removed from all kernel
parameters, and the remaining text made case insensitive (which
wouldn't be hard to do), but such a change would need to be agreed on
in advance by all the senior deevelopers.

Personally, I'd like to see any unrecognised kernel options logged in
syslog, thus pointing out where attention might be needed.

True.
Best wishes from Riley.
