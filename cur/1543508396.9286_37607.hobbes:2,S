Hmm. Am I missed announce about fix for few-years old DMA problem or what ?
Allocation DMA memory can fail even on 64MiB system (I seen it) and in theory
even on 17MiB system :-(( There are was some ideas about fixing/workarounding
it (mostly from Rik van Riel <riel@humbolt.geo.uu.nl> but some can be found
on www.alsa-project.com) but AFAIK noone suggested idea sane enough to pass
Linus test yet...
