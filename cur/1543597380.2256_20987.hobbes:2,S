Not that I think anyone is going to take me up on this, judging from prior  
experience ...
... but if we are looking for a clean solution to types and constants that  
are needed to communicate between kernel and user space, IMO the thing to  
do is to define these in some sort of generic format, and have a tool to  
generate actual headers from that according to whatever kernel, libc or  
whoever wants to see. Possibly more than one tool as requirements differ.
That generic format *could* be a restricted form of C (restricted to only  
those features needed for this task), but need not be.
The tool in question is not all that difficult to write; *if* people think  
this is the right way to go (and agree on some of the necessary details),  
I could write it. In C, even, so it doesn't need extra tools.
