well, reloading the idt is already done in "machine_real_start", look
at line 255 (definition) and line 336 (execution).
what I've never heard of is the IO-APIC (allthough there's a file
named io_apic.c just in the same directory). there surely is a way to
"get rid of it" and have the 8259(A) or the emulating chipset(?) take
over again. do you have, or do you know where I can find, documention
about the IO-APIC? probably that's the reason why I don't see any
hardware interrupts.

I've been afraid of that :-) okay ... I'll try. So far, I've already
been checking linux-bios (didn't help much) and OpenBIOS. Hm, hm!
It looks like (just as I ask google for FreeBIOS) that FreeBIOS is
another different project.

thanks for the hint. It looks promising.
