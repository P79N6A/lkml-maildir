Halo,
I have just crashed linux 2.4.18pre3 several times
with mozilla 0.9.[67[. My setup is a Toshiba laptop
(satellite 4300) with stock redhat 7.1 (except the
kernel and mozilla of course).
I am sure that the kernel is crashed because it killed
all my telnet connections I had from other boxes. I
had set them up in order to kill X and/or mozilla but
the trick didn't work. Ping from other boxes however
did work.
To reproduce it:
-if you don't have a yahoo account create one
-mail me to send you the big (1MB) bad (spam) mail
that triggered the crash (total unresponsive system).
-try to open it from your account.
I am not subscribed to the list but I will read any
answers from the WWW archives.
Thank you for your time
  .Bill
