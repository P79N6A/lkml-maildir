Ok I didn't mean that as criticism, but a real question :)
Auto-learning in itself doesn't seem novel, but so you're saying it's
novel in ust how integrated it is - no mnual intervention necessary?

Does grsec's learning mode come closer to yours?  (I've never used
grsec, just got the impression it did a lot of auto-learning stuff)

hey that's a nice chart.  I'd link it explicitly from the doc...

do you track mounts namespace cloning?
Well I don't see how you could without a new lsm hook  :)  But it seems
like something you'd need to really support this claim.  Any plans of
it?

Cool - by all means keep this list in your next version of this doc.

Right.
No need to defend it, not everyone needs it.  Just make it clear that
you don't care to support information flow control, then noone can
attack TOMOYO saying "it shouldn't be upstream bc it fails to provide
information flow control."

I'd argue, but it's really not relevant right now  :)

capability and multi-admin can provide extra privilege to non-root
users.

Cool.
