Your understanding of statistics leaves something to be desired.  As you 
add disks the probability of a single failure is grows linearly, but the 
probability of double failure grows much more slowly.  For example:
If 1 disk has a 1/1000 chance of failure, then
2 disks have a (1/1000)^2 chance of double failure, and
3 disks have a (1/1000)^2 * 3 chance of double failure
4 disks have a (1/1000)^2 * 7 chance of double failure
Thus the probability of double failure on this 4 drive array is ~142 
times less than the odds of a single drive failing.  As the probably of 
a single drive failing becomes more remote, then the ratio of that 
probability to the probability of double fault in the array grows 
exponentially.
( I think I did that right in my head... will check on a real calculator 
  later )
This is why raid-5 was created: because the array has a much lower 
probabiliy of double failure, and thus, data loss, than a single drive. 
  Then of course, if you are really paranoid, you can go with raid-6 ;)
