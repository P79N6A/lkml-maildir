Indeed, but the code (pcspkr.c) looks completely non-portable, e.g.:
   outb_p(inb_p(0x61) | 3, 0x61);
[no comment]
So I'd guess that the Kconfig file should have more dependencies added;
what they are I have no idea.  [I guess it has something to do with old
ISA-bus-compatibility stuff.]

Yeah, v850.  I'd think you shouldn't do it for any arch except those
you know actually support this stuff.
