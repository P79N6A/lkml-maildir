Not a bad idea.  However, I don't think I like having to mkdir and
rmdir all those Generated/ directories all the time.  So, as a
counter-proposal, one of the following:
  -X '*.[osi]' -X 'tmp.*'            # ...which I prefer
  -X '*.[osi]' -X '*.tmp'            # ...the conventional *.??? look
I don't believe it would be a hardship to force files to begin or end
with `tmp'.  It's not like our filenames have stupid length
limitations....
