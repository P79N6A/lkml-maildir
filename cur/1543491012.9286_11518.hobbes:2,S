Mine is almost the same:

		NGMC1698
		9831
		AN3125.1

dmesg gives me the following:
tulip.c:v0.89F 5/12/98 becker@cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov
eth0: NETGEAR NGMC169 MAC at 0xb800, <hardware address>, IRQ 5.
eth0:  MII transceiver found at MDIO address 1, config 1000 status 782d.
eth0:  Advertising 01e1 on PHY 1, previously advertising 01e1.
That's with the tulip.c that came on the NetGear drivers floppy, from
their Linux directory.  I've been careful to use that tulip.c, but then
tulip.c in the kernel hasn't been updated or included in patch in the
2.2.x series (perhaps because it hasn't needed to be, likely).
I've had nary a problem with the NG on my Linux box.  Had to get the
latest drivers for the on in my NT box, though; it kept crashing with
the distributed drivers.  Damn MS, always changing stuff! :/
Also, afaik, I don't have a VIA chipset.  I've the Asus P5A mobo, and
don't think that has that particular chipset.  My Linux box is all
SCSI, anyhow, though.  My NT box is running a BH6, which uses an Intel
chip, so no way to test the implications there with a VIA/NG clash.

Of course, Via has this to say about their 586 chip:
	   The VIA Apollo VPX/97 features the VIA
           VT82C586B PCI-IDE south bridge controller chip.
           Highly integrated, this chip complies with the
           Microsoft® PC97industry standard by supporting
           ACPI/OnNow, Ultra DMA/33 and USB technologies. 
Would compliance with MS's industry standard (now wait a sec, isn't
that an oxymoron??) cause you guys any problems?
Just food to chew on.  I'll be quiet now and listen to my betters. ;)

Damn cards just won't stop growing wings, will they? :)
