What kinds of heavy loads? If you were triggering the out of nocache
memory BUG, then this patch may help. I fixes a bug where fork fails and
calls destroy_context on the parent's mm or more precisely a memcpy'd
duplicate of it. In that case when fork returns to the parent, it
continuously faults.
But if your load does not fork heavily, then this is probably not the
problem.
