Subject: comments on adding slist.h

since we've already list.h, what about adding slist.h for
single linked lists?
single linked list are often used within the kernel,
specifically slist_for_each() could be useful, since we can use
prefetch() there.  (slist_for_each could be used 42 times alone net/core)
any comments, (like, single linked lists are so trivial, there is no
need for a header file. or, the programmer has to take care of using
prefetch() when traversing single linked lists ...) are welcome.
thanks,
