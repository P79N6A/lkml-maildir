I think there was a problem with some of the older Buslogic flashpoint 
cards not playing well with IDE interfaces.  It might have been related to 
a particular Pentium II chipset though I forget the precise details.  We ended 
up changing the cards for a different model (on the advice of Mylex tech 
support) and this cured the problem.
