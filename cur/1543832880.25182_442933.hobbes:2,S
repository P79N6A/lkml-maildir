So it would seem..
I know absolutely nothing about the driver model (let alone C or kernel voodo in general) and have 
been investigating Documentation/driver-model. Would I be close if I were to suggest this needs to 
be a platform_driver? I'll certainly have a crack at it if I'm on the right track.
I've been having a look at some of the other drivers that use platform_driver however I'm a bit 
stumped at how I go about iterating through the various sparc buses using the platform_driver 
resource allocation functions.
#ifdef __sparc__
         struct linux_ebus *ebus;
         struct linux_ebus_device *edev;
#ifdef __sparc_v9__
         struct sparc_isa_bridge *isa_br;
         struct sparc_isa_device *isa_dev;
#endif
#endif
Or, do I just dodgy it up as the rtc is a legacy device, and leave the probe/allocation code alone 
and just add the pm stuff?
