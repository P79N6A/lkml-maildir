We can add that check to slab_node() to avoid these issues and it will be 
out of the fast path then. I would like to hear about alternatives to 
this. You really want to run the useless fastpath? Examine lists etc for 
the local node despite the policy telling you to get off node?
Hmm. Is a hugepage ever allocated from interrupt context? We may have the 
same issues there.
