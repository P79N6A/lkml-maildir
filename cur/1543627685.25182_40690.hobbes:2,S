Subject: 2.5.8 IDE oops (TCQ breakage?)

I have a 486 box which ran 2.5.7 fine, but 2.5.8 oopses during
boot at the BUG_ON() in drivers/ide/ide-disk.c, line 360:
	if (drive->using_tcq) {
		int tag = ide_get_tag(drive);
		BUG_ON(drive->tcq->active_tag != -1);
Relevant .config is
# CONFIG_PCI is not set
CONFIG_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE=y
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDISK=y
CONFIG_IDEDISK_MULTI_MODE=y
(That's it. No chipset support selected; neither I nor Linux
has ever detected any known IDE chipset in this box...)
Why is drive->using_tcq non-zero when CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDE_TCQ=n
and the disk is an early/mid-90s 500MB WD drive?
