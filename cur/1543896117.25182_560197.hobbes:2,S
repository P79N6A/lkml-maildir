Which creates another, much WORSE problem.
Authentication information is part of a series of things that POSIX
requires you to keep on per-descriptor basis (because POSIX assumes that
you can suid/sgid a process without any security implications for file
descriptors that are already open). It is quite natural to pass it
around by means of the struct file.
If you don't want to pass the struct file around, then you at least need
to come up with an alternative mechanism that allows filesystems to
provide correct semantics in the standard non-union case.
