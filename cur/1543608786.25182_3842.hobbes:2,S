It was a dark and stormy night.  Suddenly "Matthew Clark" <matt@eee.nott.ac.uk> wrote:

PCI interrupts can be shared, but every handler must be registered with the
SA_SHIRQ flag on the request_irq() call.  Both the request_irq() and free_irq()
routines need a "dev_id" cookie to uniquely identify your instance of the
interrurpt handler.
You can see shared interrupts in "/proc/interrupts" because there will be a
comma-separated list of handler names for each IRQ level.
