"Size", "length", "width", "depth" is all the same in that one needs to
know the unit of measurement. The unit of measurement of ARRAY_SIZE is
one array member. This makes it useful as a bound for [ ] pointer
arithmetic which uses the same unit.
If you want to look at it from a slightly higher level of abstraction
and want to avoid the ambiguity WRT units of measurement (C programs
most often use Byte as unit for data size), consider the unitless
(cardinal) ARRAY_INDEX_BOUND or ARRAY_CARDINALITY. (In a language which
starts array indexes at 1 instead of 0, it could also be called
ARRAY_HIINDEX.)
But fortunately...

...those who know that the ARRAY_SIZE macro is available also know what
it means and how to use it. Therefore there is no need to rename this macro.
