The might_sleep() warnings are due to our adding a might_sleep() check to a
place where we've _always_ been illegally sleeping.  So a bisection search
won't tell you anything on that front.
The "kernel BUG in migration_call at kernel/sched.c:4044!" is due to one of
the scheduler patches.  I thought Ingo and Rusty had a handle on that one.
