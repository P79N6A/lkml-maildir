Not possible - EVMS doesn't export the lower-level device nodes at all.
That is one of the benefits - you can take 1000 drives and stack them
and raid and LVM them all you want, and you don't consume 1000*layers
device nodes.

Um, how about EXT3_I() and EXT3_SB(), or almost any filesystem in
2.5 which hides inode->u.generic_ip->foo_inode_info->blah?  Given
that you want to keep lines < 80 chars where possible having short
names to access common methods is a big win, IMHO.
Are you telling me XFS doesn't have some awful abstractions in it too?
VOP_GETATTR(), ugh.  So, yes it's nice to have useful criticism, but
no need to pick every space and tab to death.
Cheers, Andreas
