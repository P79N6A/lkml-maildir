Fair enough!

Need an smp_mb() here for non-x86 CPUs.  Otherwise, the CPU can

Could precede the put_cpu_var(), but why increase latency?

Assuming that the memory barriers are added, I can see a bunch of ways for
races to extend grace periods, but none so far that result in the fatal
too-short grace period.  Since rcu_qsctr_inc() refuses to increment
the quiescent-state counter on any CPU that started an RCU read-side
critical section that has not yet completed, any long critical section
will have a corresponding CPU that will refuse to go through a quiescent
state.  And that will prevent the grace period from completing.

If the sum of all the RCU read-side critical sections consumed much more
than 1/N of the CPU time, where N is the number of CPUs, then you would
see infinite grace periods just by statistics.  But my guess is that
you would be in the tens of CPUs before hitting this.  That said, I have
never measured this, since there has not been a reason to care.

Makes sense to me.  If there are too-long RCU read-side critical sections,
they could cause other tasks to miss deadlines once boosted.
Of course, if RCU read-side critical sections are all short enough,
you would already just be disabling preemption across all of them.  ;-)
