Perhaps a compile-time test to check if the argument is
a constant, and only in that case call your new kmalloc, otherwise
a non-inline kmalloc call? With your current patch, a non-constant
size argument to kmalloc means that the function is inlined anyway,
leading to unnecessary bloat in the resulting image.
