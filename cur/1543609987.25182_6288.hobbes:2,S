Hi all
I just recompiled my server's kernel without highmem to test if I could
tweak a little more speed out of it that way. After booting up on the new
kernel, I do a 'free', and get the answer 'total 1238188'.
I've double-checked, double built and double-scratched-my-head...
How can this be? I thought a kernel without highmem wasn't supposed to
find any more than 960/1024MB,,,
I'm running 2.4.13-ac5+tux
