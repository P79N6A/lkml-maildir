[PATCH snipped]
Cruel joke. Now 80 percent of the Intel clones won't boot.
Those are the ones that run industry, you know, the stuff that
is necessary to earn money.
Without i386 support, you don't have any embedded systems. You
need to use the garbage Motorola CPUs and the proprietary
operating systems in embedded stuff.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
