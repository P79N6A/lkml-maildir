I've found a reproducable system crash in the kernel.
  When using the Kernel 2.2.5 and the Sound Blaster Module with an
ESS1868, xfmix version 0.2 will crash the system completely.  The system
that this happens on was a AMD K6-2 333 with 128 MB RAM running Debian
2.1.  xfmix does not crash my PII 300 with an es1370. 
  Please, CC any messages related to this to nick-42@usa.net, as I do
not read the kernel mailing list regularly.
Thanks,
Nick Nassar nick-42@usa.net
