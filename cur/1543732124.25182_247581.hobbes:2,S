Hmm...I understand what you say. Consuming PG_xxx bit in buddy allocator is harmful
because no PG_xxx bit is used in current kernel's one.
What this patch implements is
"How to record shape of the mem_map needed by buddy allocator without using some
 structure which must be resized at memory resizing."
Because I had to record some information about shape of mem_map, I used PG_xxx bit.
1 bit is maybe minimum consumption.
If consumption of 1 bit in a page structure is too harmful,
I have to record information in some structure which needs to be resized
at memory resizing. When I do so, this patch itself is meaningless, I think.
I'll consider more, but...
