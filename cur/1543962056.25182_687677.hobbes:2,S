First off, I agree with Andrew, this is a very welcome thing to do.  If
there's anything I can do to help this out, please let me know.

That's a good first start :)
Lots of the existing printk() type wrappers can also use the dev_*
versions as well (like the ALSA ones for example.)  So it might be
easier to focus on the existing users of these two functions, and then
work to convert the other different variants over to the dev_printk ones
where possible and d_printk where not (you don't always have a struct
device to use at the moment, which is required by dev_printk)
If you want to start with the USB core and drivers, I'll be glad to help
ensure those patches go in as well.
thanks,
