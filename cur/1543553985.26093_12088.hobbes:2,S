I could go along with this.  The user, however, had the default break,
and, to my knowledge, there are no tools to diagnose the current (or any
other) machine anywhere in the kernel.  Maybe it is time to do such a
tool with exports that the configure programs could use as defaults.  My
thought is that the tool could run independently on the target system
(be it local or otherwise) with the results fed back to configure.
(Oops, corollary to the rule that "The squeaking wheel gets the grease."
is "S/he who complains most about the squeaking gets to do the
greasing."  I better keep quiet :)
