/ and /var/spool are on the same channel on the Mylex. If it's a question of
an entire channel hung up, / must be blocked too. Please note, this happened
on several machines so I guess it's not a hardware fault in the Mylex card.

I'll check that next time if the command is runnable.

Thanks, I'll try that also next time.
In the meantime, are there any patches I should apply or other things to
try? I'd rather see there is no "next time"... Since we also upgraded to
ReiserFS 3.6 it seems difficult/impossible to quickly revert to a
2.2-kernel.(?) These are production machines and people are getting upset
about these lockups.
All help appreciated,
regards Johan
