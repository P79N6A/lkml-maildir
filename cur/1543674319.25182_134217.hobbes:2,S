Hi Randy.
 > There are 3 widely-used date formats, but only one standard one.

 > 05/15/2003  (US et al order; the worst of the 3 IMO :)
 > 15/05/2003  (or your 15 May 2003)
 > 2003/05/15  (ISO standard)
The above is just plain wrong...
05/15/2003  - US style
15/05/2003  - European style
2003/05/15  - Japanese numeric style
2003-May-15 - Japanese text style
15-May-2003 - UK style
2003-05-15  - ISO style
Personally, I find any of the last group to be perfectly readable,
but find the first group (especially the first two) plain confusing.
Best wishes from Riley.
