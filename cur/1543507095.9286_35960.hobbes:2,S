As it should be.  mlock/mlockall apply to _all_ pages which appear in
your process' address space, regardless of whether they are page cache
or local data pages.

Yes.  If MCL_FUTURE is used then all future mmap()s are automatically
marked as locked, and we do a make_pages_present() before returning
from mmap.  This is exactly what mlockall is designed for: memory
access should simply never page fault if you use MCL_CURRENT |
MCL_FUTURE.  This is even true for writable MAP_PRIVATE pages: if you
have full mlockall enabled, then the make_pages_present() will do a
copy-on-write page fault for you.
