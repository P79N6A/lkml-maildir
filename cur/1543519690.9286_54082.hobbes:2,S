already understood.  I was using the return value of times() only,
which is the elapsed real time in scheduler ticks since boot.

I don't need more than ms precision.  Also, it's a matter of convenience.  
If I switch to using tv's, my time comparison macro
inline bool clock_after(clock_t a, clock_t b)
{
        long diff = (long) (a - b);	/* avoids rollover errors */
        return (diff > 0);
}         
gets more complicated:
inline bool tv_after(const struct timeval &a, const struct timeval &b)
{
        long diff = (long) (a.sec - b.sec);
	if (diff) return (diff > 0);	/* avoids rollover errors */
	return a.usec > b.usec;
}         
and I was too lazy to write it until just now.  I've been using
system ticks for this longer than I can remember, so there was
a certain intertia... plus now I have to make sure tv_after works.

See 
http://kernelnotes.org/lnxlists/linux-kernel/lk_9912_02/msg00232.html
(a way to eliminate the syscall overhead) and ensuing discussion.  
If this ever makes it into a real kernel, gtod() might be faster than times().

Nowhere in the man pages does it explain what units 'clock tick' are in.
Following the man pages leads you to CLK_TCK, which is wrong (it's 1000000 
rather than 100).
Only by oral tradition does one discover HZ or (much better)
sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).  
IMHO 'man times' should mention sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK), and depricate HZ,
CLK_TCK, and CLOCKS_PER_SEC.  
Note also that 'man sysconf' claims that sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK) == CLK_TCK,
which is untrue.  
I'm still a bit confused about all that.  I believe that SUS mandated
a certain value for CLOCKS_PER_SEC.  Better to just erase it from the
face of the earth, since a compile time constant is just wrong for the
units of system scheduler ticks.
