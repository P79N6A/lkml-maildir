with a dual processor with hyper threading where the kernel sees
CPU0-CPU1 (first CPU) and CPU2-CPU3 (second CPU), and you run a cpu
wasting job, it will be scheduled on CPU0, then the second CPU wastint job
will be scheduled on CPU2, and so on, with this alternation
CPU0-CPU2-CPU1-CPU3. So, as you see, the scheduler is smarter, and this
way it CPUs are used at best for what the system can. Then maybe there
could be some discussion about MPI jobs, (I should make some test, and I
am curious to listen someone else experience).
