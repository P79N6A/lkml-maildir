For the producer/consumer case, you want to initialize the semaphore to
0, not 1 which DECLARE_MUTEX(sem) does.  So I would use
__DECLARE_SEMAPHORE_GENERIC(sem, 0)
The count is then the number of items produced but not yet consumed.

Then consumer could be:
	consumer()
	{
		int i;
		start_producers();
		/* Wait for 10 items to be produced */
		for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
			down(&sem);
	}
