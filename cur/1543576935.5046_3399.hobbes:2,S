"Modversions included
Modversions *is* being included... putting a message into the header
file shows it to be correctly included at compile time.  However by the
time the C file is processed it the symbols it has defined appear to no
longer exist.  When you put the patch into drmP.h it never re-includes
modversions (the pragma is not hit, because _LINUX_MODVERSIONS_H is
already defined) *but* the macros within it suddenly become active.
I'm confused!
Preprocessor bug?  Demon possessed compiler?
