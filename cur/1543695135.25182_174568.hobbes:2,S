Modifying source code requires programming capabilities, which means
that the most clueless won't do it at all.  It's something that needs
to be done by the upstream authors, or perhaps by the distributions,
at which point the clueless will get it when they upgrade.
It's not matter of catering to the ineptitude of the clueless but
pursueing a design which doesn't leave an open manhole cover where a
clueless system administrator can screw up and put their entire system
at risk.  Consider that even if the distributions ship a package using
your system, there will be a config file which will be an opportunity
for a system administrator to screw up.  In general, for any
particular system program, there is only one acceptable setting in
terms of what capabilities it will need.  So why make it be something
which can be screwed up in a config file?  
Fix it once, by a programmer who knows what he/she is doing, and the
problem is fixed for everyone.  Furthermore, it will be more efficient
since it avoids an exec and requirement for a program to parse a
config file.
