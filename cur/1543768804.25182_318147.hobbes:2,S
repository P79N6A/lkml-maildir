Well ... that was less than obvious.  You quoted too much, and
responded with information about other semaphores, not about
why other duties of _this_ semaphore made such a rename wrong.
Fortunately, Nathan clarified matters.
So how would you, or Srivatsa or Nathan, respond to my more substantive
point, to repeat:
Srivatsa, replying to Dinakar:

Why just in sched_setaffinity()?  What about the other 60+ calls to
set_cpus_allowed().  Shouldn't most of those calls be checking that the
passed in cpus are online (holding lock_cpu_hotplug while doing all
this)?  Either that, or at least handling the error from
set_cpus_allowed() if the requested cpus end up not being online?  I see
only 2 set_cpus_allowed() calls that make any pretense of examining the
return value.
