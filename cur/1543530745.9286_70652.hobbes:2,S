No, it's definitely too experimental - there are places that play games
with the irq state etc, so there can be things that need quite a lot of
debugging to get the threaded-UP case working fine.
Maybe during 2.5.x we can back-port the changes to a 2.4.x release, and
give people a three-way choice: UP, threaded-UP or SMP. But it's not a
2.4.x development thing.
