yes it is

in fact this is the most probrably hypothesis of my problems....
this reply has been also forwarded to the author of the winbond driver
(a guy from the czech republic) and to cornelius (many thanx for your
comments).
to confirm this hypotesis i can just compile the kernel with both
acpi and ethernet but without the isdn driver. if irq sharing is ok
then the problem must be in the file drivers/isdn/w6692.[ch]
thanx a lot to everybody supporting linux and in particular to
those who are helping me in this tedious problem.
