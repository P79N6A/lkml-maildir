Yes, some time ago. I was having occasional lock-ups and suspected from
bad (or low quality) RAM, so I left memtest86 running for a day, and it
reported no problems at all. However, at this time I couln't find anything
in the logs.
Maybe it just another case of crappy hardware, that from time to time
seems to be more sensitive to load and starts giving errors more frequently.
