Directories can, and frequently are, moved.  If you kept the dir inode close to its parent dir inode, you'd have to move dir inodes around every time you move directories.  Less is more.
Keeping the dir inodes uniform means the time to perform a name->inode lookup is relatively the same regardless of directory.  While admittedly this does not always yield the fastest performance, in this case we prefer consistency over speed.
I'm sure there are other good reasons too, but these two are enough to justify it.
