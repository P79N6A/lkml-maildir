Well, yes, 30 processes at a time on a single CPU does seem a bit silly -
given that (under the old system), you would not expect X to get more than
3% of the CPU time.
Also sceduling normal processes (ie, not real-time processes) as RR/FIFO
seemed also pretty bad.
However....
But I have to now admit that I haven't yet played with 2.5.47 seriously,
and wansn't aware of the problems which Andrew just posted.
mea culpa.
