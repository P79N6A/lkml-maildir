Hallo l-k,
I have three scenarios:
The first one:
Boot linux to multi-user: when initialize PCMCIA, then kernel
freeze
The second one:
Boot linux to single-user and then run /etc/init.d/pcmcia start
(I have Debian sid distribution): kernel freeze
The third one:
Boot linux to the multi-user, but w/o initializing PCMCIA. When
computer booted, go to single user using 'init 1'. Then try to
initialize PCMCIA: PCMCIA works!!!??? Now I can switch to
multi-user and everythink works fine...
Is there a method to test where is the problem?
Sincerely
Jan Marek
