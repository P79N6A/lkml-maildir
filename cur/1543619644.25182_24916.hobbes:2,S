You appear to be in more trouble than I can get you out of. Could you
try again with -aa or -rmap against a recent kernel? (mainline VM appears
not to behave as well as either of these).

Kernel hacking. Until you get yourself a stabler VM it probably won't
be meaningful to try that directly, though making this tunable would be
nice, too. I've heard it's difficult to merge xfs with VM changes due to
its invasiveness in the VM, but I've heard of it being done several times.
Cheers,
Bill
