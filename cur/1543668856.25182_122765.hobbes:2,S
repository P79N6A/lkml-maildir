Subject: [PATCH][2.4.21-pre7] fix genksyms core dump in drivers/char/joystick
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

For a long time now, building a 2.4 kernel with MODVERSIONS=y
has left a core dump from genksyms in drivers/char/joystick/.
Last Tuesday, Adam Lackorzynski reported that this was due to a
#define in pci_gameport.h: When a config option is disabled, two
functions are #defined as stubs. This causes the pre-processed
C source code containing the non-stub versions of these functions
to have serious syntax errors, which in turn causes genksyms to
dump core.
This patch fixes this problem by using inline functions for the
stubs instead of #defines.
