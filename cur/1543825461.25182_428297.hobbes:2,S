 Thinking about this again, are you sure the read urb depends on the
control message? It's quite easy to test, just a add a long timeout after
the read URB was sent (say, five minutes) and waits for the read urb
callback to run.
 If it ran _before_ the timeout expires with no timeout error it does not
depend. Then we can do the simpler solution: just kill the read urb in the
ipaq_open's error path.
