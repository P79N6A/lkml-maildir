Hmm.. this ~could be.  I once dove into the VM waters (me=stone)
and changed __alloc_pages() to only yield instead of scheduling.
The results (along with many other strange changes) were.. weirdest
feeling kernel I ever ran.  Damn fast, but very very weird ;-)

That looks a lot like cheating.

I also did some things along this line.. also with mixed results.
:) the changes I've done that I actually like best is to kill bdflush
graveyard dead.  Did that twice and didn't miss it at all.  (next time,
I think I'll erect a headstone)
