Bugzilla can do that too. But I'm not convinced this is a good idea.
We had this some years ago with the jitterbug experiment and usually
it tended to faithfully keep track of very long off topic threads
that had drifted long from the original bug. The resulting collections
of emails usually not very useful.
While other interfaces might be a culture shock for some people
at least they force them to concentrate on the particular issue --
contribute to a specific bug.
