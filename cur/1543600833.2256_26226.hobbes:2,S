Argh!  That indeed seems to be the case, _no_ apparent kernel problem
is involved, sorry for the false alarm.  read() 'just' returns -1 with
errno becoming EINTR.  One should never code up a loop like that in
the last minute (I only found the effect yesterday)..

The analysis was nevertheless correct, LinuxThreads gets out of synch
with disastrous effects.  I was puzzled how read() could return -1,
however it may make sense with a __pthread_sig_cancel pending in the
manager thread due to a child exiting (?).  But then, why wasn't this
possibility discovered before?
Below is a corrected patch for glibc-2.2.4.  I've run fork-malloc with
this for a couple of hours.
Thanks,
Wolfram.
