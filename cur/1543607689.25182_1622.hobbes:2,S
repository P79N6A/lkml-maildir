Subject: #define MADV_NORMAL different in kernel and glibc

Not a bug, just an inconsistency:
#defines for MADV_* are different between glibc-2.2.4 and recent linux kernels.
Most src/linux/include/asm*/mman.h define MADV_* in hex.  
asm-alpha and asm-parisc in Linus and Alan trees use decimal.
/usr/include/bits comes from glibc.
hrandoz@rushmore:/$ grep " MADV_" /usr/include/bits/mman.h
# define MADV_NORMAL     0      /* No further special treatment.  */
# define MADV_RANDOM     1      /* Expect random page references.  */
# define MADV_SEQUENTIAL 2      /* Expect sequential page references.  */
# define MADV_WILLNEED   3      /* Will need these pages.  */
# define MADV_DONTNEED   4      /* Don't need these pages.  */
/usr/include/asm comes from src/linux/include/asm.
hrandoz@rushmore:/$ grep " MADV_" /usr/include/asm/mman.h
#define MADV_NORMAL     0x0             /* default page-in behavior */
#define MADV_RANDOM     0x1             /* page-in minimum required */
#define MADV_SEQUENTIAL 0x2             /* read-ahead aggressively */
#define MADV_WILLNEED   0x3             /* pre-fault pages */
#define MADV_DONTNEED   0x4             /* discard these pages */
Programs like mremap04.c from the Linux Test Project that include mman.h
give a warning like:
cc -o mremap04 mremap04.c -I../../../../include -L../../../../lib -lltp
