Yep. Unfortunately there isn't any alternative, as the guilty can hide
their guilt behind IP filters.
If I were in ORBS' position, I wouldn't want to get involved in
un-listing hosts which cannot be verified, but whose admin says "Trust
me: it's not an open relay, honest". The issue of whose word you
accept is way too tricky, IMHO.
