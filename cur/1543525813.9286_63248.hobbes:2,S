Subject: via-rhine: kfree_skb on hard IRQ ... still in 2.3.45

I saw these warnings with .44, but I also saw reports for various cards so
I assumed it was going to get fixed by someone who knows what he is doing.
Failing that ... :)
kfree_skb -> dev_kfree_skb_irq in the interrupt handler (I assume, it
gets rid of the annoying warning message anyway).
kfree_skb -> dev_kfree_skb since I saw someone else make that change ...
