Hi All. Some newbie question.
  I am writing some assembly code where I need to access the pid that issue
a certain syscall. In entry.S,  in the syscall stub, I wrote:
   GET_THREAD_INFO(%ebp)
   movl TI_task(%ebp), %ebp
   movl PID_OFFSET(%ebp), %ebx
 Questions are:
    1) Considering that I provided the correct value in PID_OFFSET, will
ebx contain the pid of the task that issued the syscall, at the end of the
fragment?
   2)  By taking some address arithmetic (&tsk.pid - &tsk) I got 144.  Is this
offset always the same? Is that an easy way to get it directly from
assembly code?
TIA,
Fabiano
