But this will always be true (not just currently):
1. Kconfig symbols will always have code associated with them.
That's the entire purpose of Kconfig, is it not?
2. "menuconfig" symbols, otoh, were _invented_ for another reason
entirely: presentation and user interface i.e. so that users are able
to disable entire menus (and all the options contained therein)
without having to enter into the menu first, and without having to
disable all options individually (which was the situation that existed
before the introduction of these menuconfig objects).
The fact that these menuconfig objects are similar to "config symbols"
is only because of the way they got implemented, and has nothing to
do with their original purpose or the problem they try to solve.
