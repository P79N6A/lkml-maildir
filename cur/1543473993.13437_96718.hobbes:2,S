Hi guys,
Ok, I see this happening on my machine with Red Hat 3.0.4.  I *never*
have problems due to bleeding-edge ncurses.
Looking at the code, lxdialog returns a different value for ' ' and '\n'.
Menuconfig then interprets these different values differently.  I started
getting environment variables after entering a couple of menus with
space bars!
I am mystified by the mechanism here.  scripts/Menuconfig is a shell
script.  It can't have pointer faults. It has to be a combination of
Menuconfig messing up the argument framing *and* lxdialog failing to
validate its parameters.
But I'm pretty sure it's not correlated with distribution or ncurses
setup.
