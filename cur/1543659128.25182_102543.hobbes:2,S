For reference, they're looking at replacing PowerMAX with Linux in the
vxWorks suite..  They're calling it RedHawk Linunx.  See the article
from Steve Brosky (my former manager) over here at : 
http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT8610061752.html
Download the full pdf if you're interested.. All of their systems are
"Hawk" systems.. PowerHawk, NightHawk, MediaHawk.. This is a play on the
RedHat name because it's based on RedHat, so they call it RedHawk.
What's cool about this is that even though I quit there for mental
health reasons, if I decided to become an active contributor for linux,
I could sort of become a volunteer employee.  (I'm still not sure how
much of my time I want to spend in kernel work.  I'm also learning
OpenGL, and orderred a book on Brain Theory and Neural Netowrks which
will probably occupy a good chunk of my time in the coming months.  All 
of these require different types of thinking and work on the computer,
so I may not waste much time in the kernel "reinventing the wheel" as it
were.)
