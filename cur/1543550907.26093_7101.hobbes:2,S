Hello!
Has anybody written a driver for the Western Digital (or similar)
PCI / Firewire adapter?
If not, I'm going to have to write one. If it doesn't exist yet, should
the device be a block device or a character device? There are some new
very-fast disks that now use Firewire so this would seem to imply that
the most "logically-correct" interface would be a block device. However,
it's also used for cameras, scanners, printers, etc. Maybe there should
be a 'firewire core' with some generic devices built around it.
Info appreciated.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
