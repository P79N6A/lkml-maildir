alas, yes, that's been there since time began, and since the window was
so minimal nobody cared enough to do anything about it.  Even on the
larger hotplug PCI servers that Greg KH mentioned, the pci list really
isn't traversed much, much less updated.
I haven't looked at it in over a year, but from a quick look, all the
list access look like they can be protected by a simple spinlock. 
You'll need to grep the tree, though, because not all users of
pci_devices are in drivers/pci/pci.c.  [users outside of drivers/pci
should really be converted to use pci_find_xxx functions in any case]
