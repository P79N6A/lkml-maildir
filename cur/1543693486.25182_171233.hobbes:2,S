	Hello,
	i have an IDE controller with Silicon Image 0680A chipset (Class
0140: 1095:0680 Subsystem: 1771:1680) and have problems using any ide device
on it (tested with Seagate and Quantum disks). i can read from the disk fine
(hdparm -t shows about 40MB/sec at 100% sys load ?? but this is not the
issue, first to get it working) but as soon as i try to write a single
sector (partition table) i get:
hde: dma_timer_expiry: dma status == 0x20
hde: DMA timeout retry
hde: timeout waiting for DMA
hde: status error: status=0x58 { DriveReady SeekComplete DataRequest }
hde: drive not ready for command
hde: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hde: no DRQ after issuing MULTWRITE
ide2: reset: success
 hde: hde1
 hde: hde1
	(last 2 lines are because of fdisk) and it disables DMA and
continues to work but very very slow (in PIO mode i think).
	this is on linux-2.6.0-test6 and 2.4.22 (siimage.c ver. 1.06), this
is the boot message:
SiI680: IDE controller at PCI slot 0000:00:0d.0
