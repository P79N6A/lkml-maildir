	Master and slave devices share the same channel, so
		master->channel		== slave->channel
		&master->channel->lock	== &slave->channel->lock
	So their queue->lock pointer would continue to point to
the same lock: &channel->lock.

	I'd be intersted in knowing what one of those other problems
is.  Otherwise, I don't understand why I can't eliminate the "lock
group" stuff.
