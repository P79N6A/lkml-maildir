It will never be 'appropriate' if the system doesn't somehow work on Joe's
hardware. We currently have something that works. In my opinion it's
pointless to take that away. The manufacturers will still stone-wall us
regardless of ndiswrapper's existence. They were doing it before ndis-
wrapper existed.

Please explain how Linux can be an 'important force' if people can't
use it? Wireless networking is very important to people.

Um, ever hear of 'compromise'?? All I'm saying is let people use what
currently works until we can get an open-source solution. Ndiswrapper's
existence is not stopping you (or anyone else) from pestering manufacturers
for spec's and writing drivers. I look at ndiswrapper as a stop-gap solution.
Hey, even Linus himself has said 'better a sub-optimal solution than no solution'.

I code, therefore I am
