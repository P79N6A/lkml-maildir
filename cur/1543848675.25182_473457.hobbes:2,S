Subject: Fwd: [PATCH] x86_64: typo in __assign_irq_vector when update pos for vector and offset
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Please check the patch.
Also I have a question about TARGET_CPUS in io_apic.c.
for a 16 sockets system with 32 non coherent ht chain. and if every
chain have 8 irq for devices, the genapic will use physflat. and it
should use you new added "different cpu can have same vector for
different irq".  --- in the i8259.c
but the setup_IOAPIC_irqs and arch_setup_ht_irq and arch_setup_msi_irq
is still using TARGET_CPUS ( it is cpumask_of_cpu(0) for physflat), so
the assign_irq_vector will not get vector for them, becase cpu 0 does
not have that much vector to be alllocated. and later
setup_affinity_xxx_irq can not be used because before irq is not there
and show on /proc/interrupts.
So I want to
1. for arch_setup_ht_irq and arch_setup_msi_irq, we can use the dev it
takes to get bus and use bus->sysdata to get bus->node mapping that is
created in fillin_cpumask_to_bus, to get real target_cpus instead of
cpu0.
2. for ioapics, may need to add another array,
ioapic_node[MAX_IOAPICS], and use ioapic address to get the numa node
for it. So later can use it to get real targets cpus when need to use
TARGET_CPUS.
Please comments.
Thanks
