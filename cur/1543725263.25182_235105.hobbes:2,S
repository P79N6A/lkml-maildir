You don't use the watcher descriptor to read the events. You use the fd
from opening up the inotify device (/dev/inotify). The inotify character
device does support the poll op.
The watcher descriptor is used for communication between the app and the
device driver. 
For example,
you perform the watch ioctl on "/tmp/" the ioctl returns '2'. Then when
reading from the char device, any event with wd == 2 is referring to the
the "/tmp/" directory.
the character device produces inotify events
struct inotify_event {
	int wd;
	int mask;
}
