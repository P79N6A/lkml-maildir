In the BeOSfs, modification/creation times are EAs that are stored into a global
database that indexes all the EAs. (as I understand it). All the EAs are searched
and modified from this global database hidden within the FS.
So thinking about EAs with per file data structure isn't necessarily representative
of this FS or possibly others, since it's thrown into a B-[*,+,...] tree.
