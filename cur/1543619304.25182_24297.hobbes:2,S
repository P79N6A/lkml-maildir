Bitkeeper also seems to have some problems applying out-of-order
changesets or applying them partially.
Changesets sent by 'bk send' are also much harder to read than
unidiffs ;)
I think for bitkeeper to be useful for the kernel we really need:
1) 'bk send' format Linus can read easily
2) the ability to send individual changes (for example, the
   foo_net.c fixes from 1.324 and 1.350) in one nice unidiff
3) the ability for Linus to apply patches that are slightly
   "out of order" - a direct consequence of (2)
regards,
Rik
