Just FYI (maybe you already know):
When ever making "make -t" in 2.2.1, the source tree ends up with 
many new empty files named "bzImage", "all_targets", "sub_dirs", etc.
You get the idea. I'm unsure whether some Makefile option could avoid 
these, but probably the existence of such files confuses make...
