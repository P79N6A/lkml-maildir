OK..
Does that name_to_dev_t() call actually work?  In my experience,
name_to_dev_t() just doesn't work if called at times other than during
early boot.
#ifdef MODULE
	mode = (readonly) ? O_RDONLY : O_RDWR;
	bdev = open_bdev_excl(devname, mode, NULL);
#else
	mode = (readonly) ? FMODE_READ : FMODE_WRITE;
	bdev = open_by_devnum(name_to_dev_t(devname), mode);
#endif
OK, I guess it still works at initcall-time.  Still, the code is a bit,
err, innovative.
