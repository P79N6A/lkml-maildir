actually I just noticed the fput is never been buggy in my tree:
	if (!file || !rb_parent || !vma_merge(mm, prev, rb_parent, addr, addr + len, vma->vm_flags, file, pgoff)) {
		vma_link(mm, vma, prev, rb_link, rb_parent);
		if (correct_wcount)
			atomic_inc(&file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_writecount);
	} else {
		if (file) {
			if (correct_wcount)
				atomic_inc(&file->f_dentry->d_inode->i_writecount);
			fput(file);
			^^^^^^^^^
		}
		kmem_cache_free(vm_area_cachep, vma);
	}
so this was a merging bug in 2.5
