Hello,

I have a Compaq Alpha server with Linux 2.4.18 and samba 2.2.4 and
NT-clients.
Problem: After accessing a file from a NT-client this file cannot be
accessed on the Linux side for a while.
Example:
Creating the file on the server (via telnet session):
     echo test >file
accessing the file from the NT-client (gives "test"):
     TYPE file
try to access it on the server (via telnet session):
     cat test
 cat: file: Invalid argument
After waiting approx. 40 sec. it succeeds.
This problem does not occur with "kernel oplocks=no" in /etc/smb.conf, but
file contents are not consistent then.
The same configuration on an Intel server (2.4.16, samba 2.2.3a) works.
Markus.
