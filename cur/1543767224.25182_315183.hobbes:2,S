Thanks for the info on how stability works with SCSI and ATA, but I think 
you lost the context of my question.
You said earlier that fsync() and O_DIRECT are ways to deal with the 
problem of delayed write errors.  I added that O_SYNC is another way.  You 
then said that O_SYNC doesn't work completely correctly in some recent 
(but not current) kernels.  You didn't say the same about fsync().
I'd like to know if you mean to say that O_SYNC has some problems in some 
kernels that fsync() does not have.
And if it isn't too much trouble, it would be nice to hear details of how 
O_SYNC is partially correct in some kernels.
