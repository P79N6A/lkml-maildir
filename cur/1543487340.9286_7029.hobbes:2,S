Well, I've got your tunelp release. I used the -T on/off option but the 
interrupt driven printing is still the same way: very slow...
I'll try a little bit more before I give up and upgrade to kernel 2.2.2. 
Besides, I didn't receive a message from anybody saying that there 
is a Stylus Color 600 printing fast (interrupt driven) with kernel 
2.0.36.
Thanks for all the help I've received...
