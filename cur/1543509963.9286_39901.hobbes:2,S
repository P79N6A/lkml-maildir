Hi there.
On kernel 2.3.16 (I believe, I didn't double-check) and above (including ac6
patch), mounting the cdrom hangs my system.
from /var/log/messages :
Sep 20 14:43:51 Mars kernel: cdrom: open failed.
Sep 20 14:43:51 Mars kernel: buff address c1117e3c length 12
Sep 20 14:43:51 Mars kernel: Kernel panic: Buffer at physical address > 16Mb
used for aha1542
unrelated (it has always done this) question : what is the following 'wrong
buffer length'-thing ?
  Vendor: T.YUDEN   Model: CD-WO EW-50       Rev: 2.16
  Type:   WORM                               ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Detected scsi CD-ROM sr0 at scsi0, channel 0, id 4, lun 0
Wrong buffer length supplied for request sense (256)
Tia,
Roel
