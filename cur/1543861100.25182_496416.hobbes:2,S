this is really no big problem (as in: works OOTB), except that if you want to boot & run 
both kernels on the same (rootfs) installation, you will need to create wrappers around 
modutils and module-init-tools, as well as udev/devfs, or whichever device file system 
you prefer to use for each kernel. There are a few minor other details but none really 
shocking.
We've done this for "our" source distro, and it works just fine.
Cheers,
Auke
