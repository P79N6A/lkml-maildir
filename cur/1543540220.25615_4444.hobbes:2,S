I see you compiled it with gcc-2.95.2.
The first thing you should probably try is compiling with the older
compiler (preferably 2.7.2.3).  I found gcc-2.95.2 to generate a very
unstable 2.2.x kernel.  All kernels but the very latest 2.4.x (2.3.??)
either did not compile or were not stable when compiled with the newer
compilers.  Although, I found I could not compile a 2.4.x kernel with
the gcc-2.7.2.3 compiler but it would compile with egcs-1.1.2, so
apparently we are finally not stuck with the old compiler with the
newest kernels.
This is from the linux-kernel mailing list FAQ.
    4. Can I compile the kernel with gcc 2.8.x, egcs, (add your xyz
       compiler here)? What about optimizations? How do I get to use
       -O99, etc.?
          + (RRR) Sure, it's your kernel. But if it doesn't work, you get
            to fix it. Seriously now, there is really no point in
            compiling a production kernel with an experimental compiler.
            Production kernels should only be compiled with gcc 2.7.2.x,
            preferably 2.7.2.3. Newer compilers are known to break the
            2.0 series kernels, known symptoms of this breakage are
            hwclock and the X server seg.faulting.
            Compiling a 2.0 kernel with egcs or gcc 2.8, even after
            applying the workaround of copying the ioport.c file from a
            late 2.1 kernel to 2.0, is not recommended and will
            inevitably lead to unpredictable kernel behaviour.
            Regarding 2.1 kernels, they usually compile fine with other
            compiler versions, but do NOT complain to the list if your
            are not using gcc 2.7.2. Linux developers have enough work
            tracking kernel bugs, to also be swamped with compiler
            related bugs.
