The problem with pci_alloc_consistent()above 1MB happens on HP rx2600
(this is 2U dual-Itanium 900MHz pci-x 133 box). I don't believe it
happens on 64 bit Opterons. Today we are going to test Dell and SGI
Itanium systems, as well as a bit newer rx 2600 with Itanium-2 1.5GHz -
I'll let you know by the end of the day.
Thanks, Leonid
