I was just playing around with x11amp and have a data point to add: The 
problem seems to occur with Skins. I'm running the base 131 at work and 
everything runs great. I'm running 131ac13 at home and when I start up x11amp 
with a SKIN specified in .x11amp/.config, it crashes with the message:
torii ~  66 % socket: Too many open files
Whooops... You caught a bug, please mail psy@x11amp.ml.org and describe what
you were doing.
If I don't specify a skin, it runs great. So, of the people that are running 
with no problem, how many are using Skins? Is anyone still running 131ac1-ac12 
that could provide some more data points so we can narrow down where the 
problem was introduced?
Happy Holidays!
