Subject: SysRq on Libretto L2?

Does anyone know how to hit the sysrq key combination on the Toshiba 
Libretto L2?
I have a japanese 106 keyboard with US layout, and the "SysRq" key is 
labeled as the Fn-Del (hold the Fn key and hit delete).  This means, 
I suppose, that I have to hit alt-function-sysrq-whatever, which 
doesn't seem to work.
Ideas?
