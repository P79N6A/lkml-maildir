While the project was a total failure in every respect it at least allows
us to have an open description of the format.  Thanks to Adaptec that we
at least have it, although an open spec would have an a lot easier way
to get that information out :)  But honestly just another raid format
is not really something you'll get us excited about, there are far too
many of them already.
If you actually published the raid sequencer code I'm pretty sure someone
would have picked up the shards of the emd project and turned it into
something useful.  I would have loved to play with that kind of thing for
certain.

I'm pretty happy that we never have to deal with Justin or Scott again,
as it saves a considerable amount of my time.
(and btw, they've been freebsd commiters and core members long before
 adaptec assigned them to do linux work, which probably was a part
 of the cultural problems when dealing with them)
