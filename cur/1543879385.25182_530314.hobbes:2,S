True, but those are often easier to protect, or are less vulnerable in
the first place. (E.g. it isn't very hard to make a constant time AES
implementation. The operations it does are independent of the key.)

True, and very specialized hardware is needed in such cases anyway, so
arguing that it's not the kernel's task to protect against such attacks
is valid. But it are interesting attacks, and people should be aware of
them, instead of blindly trusting any security measure (not implying
anyone here does, I mean in general).

Yes, but it depends on how the code is used. It is supposed to be generic code,
so whether someone wants to use it for signing or not is an open question. So
far it seems only signature checking is needed, and that simplifies a lot, but
if that isn't the case more questions pop up, like where the security threshold
should be.
The user with the tightest requirements more or less dictates the implementation.
All in all, to get anything merged at all in the kernel it seems at least the
following needs to happen:
- Future users speaking up and uniting.
- Figuring out their needs (so overlapping needs can make it into common
  code, and other decisions can be made, as where the kernel and user
  space border should be.)
- Deciding on a commonly agreed security threshold, and making that explicit.
- Coding it all up and keeping it in sync with mainline.
I don't see this happening soon. But a good start would be if someone who
cares about this sets up a mailing list or website to collect all users
and information.
Good night,
Indan
