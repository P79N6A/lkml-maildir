Subject: drivers/pci/probe.c patch in 2.6.20.4 causes 'cannot adjust BAR0 (not I/O)' on NVidia MCP51

I just upgraded from 2.6.20.2 to 2.6.20.4 on my Compaq V6000 laptop,
which has an NVidia core chipset. It has the MCP51 and uses it for PATA
and SATA.
Booting the 2.6.20.4 kernel causes two messages (and a kernel lockup)
like this:
0000:00:0d.0: cannot adjust BAR0 (not I/O)
0000:00:0d.0: cannot adjust BAR1 (not I/O)
Booting without ACPI, without APIC, without LAPIC makes no usable
difference (although sometimes I will also receive a message about BAR2).
This patch:
http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=ed8ccee0918ad063a4741c0656fda783e02df627;hp=9e5755bce00bb563739aeb0f09932a1907521167
is the cause... backing it out results in a working 2.6.20.4 kernel on
my laptop.
I'll be happy to provide any assistance I can debugging this problem.
Thanks.
