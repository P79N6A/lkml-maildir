I believe that RedHat don't build mount and util-linux from the same tree.
Maybe they do internally, but when you look at the RPMs, they appear
separate:
Name: mount
Source RPM: mount-2.10m-6.src.rpm
Name: util-linux
Source RPM: util-linux-2.10m-12.src.rpm
There don't appear to be any explicit dependencies between these two
packages either, but they do just happen to have the same version.
(I'm looking at the RH7.0 RPMs here).
This of course means that the version of mount may not match the version
of util-linux installed on the system.
