How does inotify not work here?  You are notified that the tree is
moved, your daemon goes through and relabels things as needed.  In the
meantime, before the re-label happens, you might have the wrong label on
things, but "somehow" SELinux already handles this, so I think you
should be fine.

Ok, so we fix it.  Seriously, it shouldn't be that hard.  If that's the
only problem we have here, it isn't an issue.

Agreed, so we fix that.  There are ways to speed those kinds of things
up quite a bit, and I imagine since the default SELinux behavior doesn't
use restorecon in this kind of use-case, no one has spent the time to do
the work.

Usually you don't do that by doing a 'mv' otherwise you are almost
guaranteed stale and mixed up content for some period of time, not to
mention the issues surrounding paths that might be messed up.

I'm saying that the daemon will automatically do it for you, you don't
have to do anything on your own.

Yes.

What "kernel memory and performance" issues are there?  Your SLED
machine already has inotify running on every directory in the system
today, and you don't seem to have noticed that :)

Agreed.

No, that's not the issue here.  The issue is if we can use the model
that AA is exporting to users and apply it to the model that the kernel
uses internally to access internal data structures.

Not really, LSM is there because originally people thought that a
general-purpose "hook" layer would be useful for implementing different
security models.  But for those types of models that do not map well to
internal kernel structures, perhaps they should be modeled on top of a
security system that does handle the internal kernel representation of
things in the way the kernel works.

No, git servers are only storing the sha files, not the "live" tree.
Well, if you want to waste space on your server you might have a copy of
the current tree, but that's a configuration problem on your system.

Great, have any code I can look at?  It would be nice to start with an
already working implementation that is only slow instead of trying to
start from scratch.

You still haven't answered Stephen's response to NFSv3, so until then,
please don't trot out this horse.
