Want to see if its the VM?  Rik van Riel has updated his 2.4-ac VM for
new kernels and added reverse page mapping (a neat feature).
It is available at:
	
http://www.surriel.com/patches/2.4/2.4.16-rmap-6
Give it a whirl, you might me impressed.  If not, maybe we can scratch
the VM as the problem and stare meanly at VFS ;-)
(Note my lock-break patch will fail on the new VM.  Ignore it.  The rest
is still fine. Perhaps I'll do a lock-break for this VM later).
