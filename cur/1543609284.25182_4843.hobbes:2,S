Yes, but since GET_POWER_STATUS is not really needed to control the fans
I plan to remove it from /proc/i8k and use /proc/apm which provides the
same information but can be read less frequently. Once per minute would
be fine if it is neede only to use different temperature thresholds.
This would save half of the cpu time spent in the SMM bios.
Also a higher timeout would help. Probably 5 seconds would be ok.
