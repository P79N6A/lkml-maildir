Hi,
Should something like this work correctly?
while(1) {
        FD_ZERO(&set);
        FD_SET(fd, &set);
        select(FD_SETSIZE, NULL, &set, NULL, NULL); <<<<<<< for writing
        if (FD_ISSET(fd, &set))
                sendto(fd, &datagram, 1, 0, ...);
}
fd is a normal local datagram socket. It looks select() returns with
"fd ready for write" and sendto() then blocks as the queue is full.
I don't know if it's expected behaviour or just a not yet known bug.
Of course, I have a more complete test program if needed.
2.4.21rc6, haven't tried any other version.
strace shows:
select(1024, NULL, [3], NULL, NULL)     = 1 (out [3])
sendto(3, "\0", 1, 0, {sa_family=AF_UNIX, path="/tmp/tempUn"}, 13 <<< blocks
