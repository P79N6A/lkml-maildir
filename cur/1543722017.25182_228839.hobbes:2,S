Known problem - IDE likes to mess about with resources behind the back
of PCMCIA, and with some of the changes which went into 2.6.7, this is
no longer feasible.
However, if I can get enough of my current patch queue merged, then this
problem resolves itself, since we loose the need for IDE to mess with
the resource subsystem.
