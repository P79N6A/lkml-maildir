So was I.  Why don't you think you can't have 10K cylinders on a disk? 
From Seagate's own specs, there are 8334 TPI (tracks per inch).  It's a
5.25" drive, so for the sake of argument, the disks are 4.5" diameter.
Reserve about an 1" for the center hub, halve, and you have 1.75" of
usable surface x 8334 TPI = 14584.  The drive has 9996 cylinders, so in
actuality it's using about 1.2" of radius (or about 2.5").
