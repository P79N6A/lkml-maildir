Because of the size of the scatterlist structure. As pointers are bigger
on 64-bit archs, the scatterlist structure ends up being bigger. The
page size on x86-64 is 4kb, hence the number of structures you can fit
in a page is smaller.

The sglist branch of block repo has x86-64 support now. I'll post a new
patchset tomorrow.
Performance wise, it's meant to help higher end hardware that need 2-4mb
(or bigger) commands to get good performance. That also includes things
like tapes that have big block sizes, getting a command of the right
size there is the difference between good and abysmal performance.

Perhaps, depends on a lot of factors.
