Pity. Me and probably many users have this problem.

OSS kernel compatibility is only partial and aoss method is not fully compatible either
I will try to write some code but I have very little free time for that so I am trying
to convince people to rethinking the case

just the contrary - scheduler participation is needed to avoid sound distortion
and missing samples

if doing this operations behind application back can lead to not delivering
data to kernel driver in time then these are time critical operations too!

Yes but what a complicated way. And you cannot use kernel OSS emulation
and ALSA aware apps at the same time. Also aoss with dmix are in
conflict with jackd for example.
Kernel redirector is not a bad solution - there should be some kind
of interface for such redirectors for different purposes. netlink device maybe?
For example you should redirect all these traffic to some RT daemon
doing all job.
Same with filesystem redirections. I hate these special gnomevfs or kdeio
helpers which forces to rebuilding apps with more and more libs.
Change LD_PRELOAD or LD_LIBRARY_PATH and you app will go to hell.
This is the Windows way of doing uncontrolled mess.
This plugin architecture without mandatory kernel access control leads
to serious security risc.
