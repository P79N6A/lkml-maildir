It should be safe since it's just copying pgd/pmd pointers into the
per-process page tables; the pte's are still shared.
That said, reading vmalloc.c leads to the discovery that
vmalloc_area_pages will currently race on SMP (the pmd/pte allocation
routines are not SMP safe).  Untested/obvious patch below.  Ultimately
we'll have to move the locking into pmd_alloc/pte_alloc, but I'm not sure 
if that's appropriate so close to 2.4.
