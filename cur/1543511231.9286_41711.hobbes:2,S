Im not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I am trying to use
my TI-83 in linux, so I can send programs to it. I found a module that
was created in 1997, but unfortunately it doesnt seem compatible with
2.2.x kernels.  I was wondering if anyone had any recent drivers for
this caculator, or if there is any interest in making a newer driver.
