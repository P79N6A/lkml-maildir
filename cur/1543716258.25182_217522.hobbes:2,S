Your statement is unsubstantiated.  Many companies try to work around the GPL, or walk very close 
(and often over) the fine line of compliance.  They want to get something for nothing, because 
that's what companies are there for--to make money.  There aren't very many altruistic for-profit 
companies.
Personally, what sticks in my craw is the fact that this company did something wrong, and then tried 
to defend its actions by claiming that it was to make it easier for the customer.  That excuse 
doesn't wash--what they did was *illegal*.  The fact that it also makes it harder to get open-source 
drivers is a side effect for me.
