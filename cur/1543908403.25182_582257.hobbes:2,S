Not worth splitting IMHO, these are all misuses of printk.

Except for this one, which really doesn't belong to this patch, granted.

Depends. If Andrew is going to pick the patch quickly and apply it,
then it's fine (except that I see that Andrew wasn't Cc'd, so it's
unlikely to happen.) But if Andrew doesn't want to take this patch,
then indeed, the only way to get it applied is to split it by
subsystem.

The code above looks correct to me.

The benefit of having a single call is that other calls to printk()
won't be interlaced with our message. This has been discussed lately in
a different thread. So you may think that the code above is confusing,
but it is currently the best way to ensure that related lines stay
grouped in the kernel log.
