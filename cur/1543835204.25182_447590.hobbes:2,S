Depending on your build pattern you can likely speed up rebuilds by
using ccache. 
If that doesn't help get one or two (or more as needed) cheap dual
core systems and use icecream (
http://en.opensuse.org/Icecream
) to do
a cluster build and build with -jN (N=2*available cores/threads or so)
To combine icecream and ccache in the same build you can use 
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/smallsrc/icecache.c
For parallel builds modular builds are faster than static builds
because otherwise the linker becomes a bottleneck.
