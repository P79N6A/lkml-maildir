When you have a timer which constantly increments from 0 to MAX and
wraps, and you can set the value to match to cause an interrupt,
it makes more sense to handle it the way we're doing it (which
incidentally leads to no loss of precision.)
Calculating the number of ticks missed, updating the kernel time,
and updating the timer match will cause problems with these - if
the timer has already past the number of ticks you originally
calculated, you may not get another interrupt for a long time.
So I don't actually think that your proposal will work for these
(SA11x0 and PXA).

I think your timer_opts is effectively our struct sys_timer.

This seems to only recover one tick.  What if multiple ticks were lost?
