   If the card wasn't setup by the BIOS (OBP in the Sparc case), then the driver
   won't work.  And as late as 2.4.8, RELOAD_FIRMWARE was set to '1'.  Gee,
   look what was changed in 2.4.9:
Please read what people are saying.
He said "running card"  Which means that it does not handle the
PCI master case on a running system, which I never claimed it did.
The older code does guarentee that if I did powercycle and reboot
at that point, I will get a functional card back, which the current
code does not do.
Alan's actively trying to resolve this problem by getting usable
firmware from Qlogic.  What are you doing to improve the situation
besides trolling like made on this list?
