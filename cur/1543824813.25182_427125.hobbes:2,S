No.  The kernel _tries_ to allocate memory for saving the screen, but
using routines that allocates memory immediately without waiting
for swapout.  (i.e. just use the free memory pools, and possibly discarding
non-dirty pages.) 
If this allocation fails, which it may do, just overwrite graphichs memory
anyway and loose the display contents.  The machine is in trouble anyway.
