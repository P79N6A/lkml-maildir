Hi!
As some people before I had the 'trackpoint does not work' problem 
after upgrading to 2.5.XX:
That was:
the trackpoint of your dell won't work until:
    - hibernate and wake up the system again
    - plug in an external mouse (you may remove it immediately)
it seems that dells hardware is disabling the trackpoint if you
probed for the touchpad. 
A device reset after probing does help, but I've no idea how this
would affect other synaptics touchpad devices although I think
most devices will not complain one extra reset.
