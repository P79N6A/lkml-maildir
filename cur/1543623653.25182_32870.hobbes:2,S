The scsi layer itself doesn't mind, but the page caches do. Once your
block size exceeds the page size you hit a wall of memory fragmentation
issues. Given that M/O media is relatively slow I'd be inclined to say
write an sd like driver (smo or similar) which does reblocking and also
knows a bit more about other M/O drive properties.
