I do wonder why the eth# still gets exported to users - its a royal
pain when you have multiple cards.  I guess naming by mac address
isn't ideal either when you want to hot swap one!  Naming by
pci slot would be kind of nice.
(I sometimes wish ether cards would have a good old fashioned dil
switch on so you could set an ID).
