Well, if you have power button on usb keyboard -- why should it be
handled differently from built-in button?

Hmm, yes, some thermal notifications are needed. OTOH I'm not sure if
all the hardware does sent interrupts for temperature changes (you
definitely do not get interrupts for "small" changes that do not cross
trip points), and I do not see how you can do interrupts for fan
status. Either fans are under Linux control (and kernel could tell you
when it turns fan on/off, but...), or they do not exist from Linux's
point of few.
