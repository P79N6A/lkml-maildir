No, all of those need to be done.  (Plus maybe a few more things,
I wasn't trying to be exhaustive.)  That last point is what makes
the other ones take effect ... without it, the top level IRQ will
never get dispatched to the GPIO-specific IRQ.
Look at the examples I referenced.

No, implementing all of those points is required.  That's how
the relevant parts of the IRQ layer connect to each other.
