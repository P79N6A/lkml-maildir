Well some systems, specially embedded ones, don't use hard drives for
mass storage purposes but rather MTD like flashes...

You would spend the same time to make the test as loading the key...

I don't think this is right. AES hardware can do a block encryption in
a very few cycles. If you copy the key or test the key to see if it
has changed as you proposed, then you basically increase the execution
time by a factor 2 or 3...

You said it: others parts of the kernel are unlikely to use it. So why
not optimizing the common case ?
Crypto core already seems to implement a priority mechanism. But I
don't think I'm able to say "I'd like to use this algo for encrypting
filesystems. If another part of the kernel wants to use this algo then
give it the generic one". This choice seems really to depend on the
system the kernel is running.
