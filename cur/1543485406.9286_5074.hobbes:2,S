Hello,
I've got an old Gateway 4DX2-50V that uses a Micronics JX-30 VLB motherboard and 
kernel 2.2.1 is not recognizing the PS/2 mouse.  Yes I have the option compiled 
in the kernel and yes I know it works as I've not had this problem with past 
kernels (and I kept right along with the 2.1.* kernels).  
This worked as recently as the 2.2.0-pre* kernels but doesn't seem to work now 
with my current config.  As a test, I booted from a RedHat installation floppy 
and the mouse was detected so it's not a hardware problem as far as I can tell.
I can provide any details necessary.  Also, please reply directly to me as I 
only read linux-smp.
Thanks,
tjb
