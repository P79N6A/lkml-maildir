I tried it:
2.2.10-VM9 
make dep:               31.25user 3.62system 1:00.32elapsed 57%CPU
make dep (second time): 32.11user 3.44system 1:03.14elapsed 56%CPU
make bzImage:           484.68user 30.97system 8:46.40elapsed 97%CPU
2.3.8
make dep:               31.04user 3.73system 1:06.47elapsed 52%CPU
make dep (second time): 32.12user 3.38system 0:43.90elapsed 80%CPU
make bzImage:           484.01user 32.10system 8:49.51elapsed 97%CPU
2.3.7-andrea1:
make dep:               31.37user 3.54system 1:00.25elapsed 57%CPU
make dep (second time): 31.95user 3.70system 1:02.69elapsed 56%CPU
make bzImage:           485.56user 33.05system 8:48.07elapsed 98%CPU
I cannot tell you what caused the differences between this and
yesterday's figures. I did both testings twice. Only the kernels
I compiled differed. 2.3.7-andrea1 for the previous one and 2.3.8
for this one but that should not cause this.
The interesting things in this were the second "make dep" times.
2.3.8 did it in 30% less time. I did the timings this way for both
the yesterday's and today's figures:
<reboot>
make mrproper
<copy a saved config file to the source tree>
make oldconfig
sync ; sync ; time make dep
sync ; sync ; time make dep
sync ; sync ; time make bzImage
