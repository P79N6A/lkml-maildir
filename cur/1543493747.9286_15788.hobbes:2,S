Hi,
Alan hacked the aha152x driver a few weeks ago to make it
do less with interrupts disabled.
From my reading of it, this looked good, as it should have
made my machine /not/ stop responding while scanning.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to have made any difference
- is there another weakness in the driver which might make
it just sit there while speaking to slow devices?  (Or
maybe even the sg driver?)
From dmesg;
# modprobe aha152x
aha152x: BIOS test: passed, detected 1 controller(s)
aha152x0: vital data: PORTBASE=0x140, IRQ=10, SCSI ID=7,
reconnect=enabled, parity=enabled, synchronous=disabled, delay=100,
extended translation=disabled
aha152x: trying software interrupt, ok.
scsi0 : Adaptec 152x SCSI driver; $Revision: 1.7 $
scsi : 1 host.
The scanner's an old Microtek Scanmaker E3 which, apart from this,
works flawlessly.  Nothing else on the SCSI card, and I don't have
any other SCSI kit (well, I don't have the right cable for my Sun
box, anyway) to try to narrow down the problem.  No significant
bus traffic while scanning (no disk, and the mouse doesn't move,
so no graphical stuff :)
Ideas, anyone?
Cheers,
Matthew.
