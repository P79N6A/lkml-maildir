There was no flamage. It is literally true.

This trips over ideological issues best not discussed on lkml.

You'd be well-served by talking to Peter Williams sometime. He's a
knowledgable individual. I should also mention that Con Kolivas did
significant amounts of work to get the early codebase he inherited
from me working before things were handed off to Peter Williams.

Last I checked there were limits to runtime configurability centering
around only supporting a compiled-in set of scheduling drivers, unless
Peter's taken it the rest of the way without my noticing. It's unclear
what you have in mind in terms of dynamic extensibility. My only guess
would be pluggable scheduling policy/class support for individual
schedulers in addition to plugging the individual schedulers, except
I'm rather certain that Williams' code doesn't do anything with modules.
