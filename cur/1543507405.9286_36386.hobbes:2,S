Hi !
I really like all the updates, which where done in the last for the ISDN-Code
in the kernel, but since then my Teles 16.3c (PNP) is not working with any
newer kernel (since 2.2.10 and 2.3.10) anymore. Could someone maybe check ?
Log-Message is:
Aug 25 00:31:47 P100 kernel: HiSax: Support for Teles 16.3c Card not selected
Aug 25 00:31:47 P100 kernel: HiSax: Card Teles 16.3c not installed 
And yes: I selected it with make menuconfig (16.0 and if possible 16.3c !) !
Thanks,
Helge Deller.
