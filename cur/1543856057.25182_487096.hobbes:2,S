A process with nice of -20 can easily get the interactivity status. When it
expires, it still go back to the active array. It just hide the TCP problem,
instead of solving it.
For a process with nice value of -20, it will have the following advantages
over other processes:
(1) its timeslice is 800ms, the timeslice of a process with a nice value of
0 is 100ms
(2) it has higher priority than other processes
(3) it is easier to gain the interactivity status.
The chances that the process expires and moves to the expired array with
packets within backlog is much reduces, but still has the chance.
