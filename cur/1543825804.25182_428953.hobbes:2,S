well, the short-term answer is that Herbert's fix is correct and we need 
to do it even if it degrades the efficiency of irqfixup/irqpoll.
after this fix is applied, irqfixup/irqpoll should be enhanced to take 
advantage of disable_irq_handler().
in any case, correctness comes first - not honoring IRQ_DISABLED can 
lead to lockups.
