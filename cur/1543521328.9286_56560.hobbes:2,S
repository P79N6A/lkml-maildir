	2.2.14 Appears to be more stable on my SS-10's than 2.2.13 was but I
   did get a spin_lock crash this morning.
 ...
	The 4/670 that I have with same CPU's was stable under 2.2.13 and
   continues to be stable under 2.2.14.
Are these identical kernel images?
Based upon that, the next question is, are your compilers identical
on both systems?
Later,
