Actually, each time I look at init/main.c I feel like we are super lucky 
that Linux boots ;-)

Well, my point was that actually populate_rootfs() does _very_ little 
with regard to FS manipulation, acpi_find_dsdt_initrd() even less. The 
task of checking that everything needed is available beforehand is 
certainly not the same magnitude as the one of the Danaides as you 
seemed to implied ;-)
The fact is, this patch has been tested a lot, because it's been used by 
several distributions for a long time. I expect that the only potential 
problems are corner cases that are possible to work around.

Yes, we agree on this. That would be crazy :-)

I'm actually the author of this comment... The static/init firmware 
infrastructure that I mentioned was more just about a way to hide the fs 
access in a special part of the kernel, not avoiding it. We used to have 
a different way but it was even uglier: append the DSDT after the 
initramfs, and then access it _directly_. This implies teaching 
populate_rootfs() to not panic when seeing DSDTs and loosing the benefit 
of the compression.
That said, I'm really not against any complete different approach. All 
that is needed is being able to read a file early at boot (the DSDT) 
without having to recompile the kernel each time the file is modified. 
For instance someone had once mentioned modifying the in-kernel DSDT by 
unlinking and relinking the bzimage. If one can show me how to do that 
I'd be happy to implement it...
