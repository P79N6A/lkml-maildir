I'm porting code from a Pentium III processor to a Pentium M processor
using kernel version 2.4.22.  Both processors contain 1.5Gig of RAM.  I
noticed High Memory Support must be disabled on the Pentium M platform due
to a bug that was fixed in kernel version 2.4.26.  Does anyone know how the
bug was fixed and what changes I need to port back into kernel version
2.4.22?  For various reasons, upgrading my system to kernel version 2.4.26
is not an option.  Please respond to keith.lemay@ultra-ats.com.
