I've been trying in vain to post a response to this thread...
Content is text/plain, encoding is ISO 8859-1.
Yet it doesn't land in the mailing list.
I've included about three URL's to captured data.
Is that a problem? Any further hints on what to avoid,
and how else to pass big logfiles / binary screenshots?
