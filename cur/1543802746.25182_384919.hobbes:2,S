Yes, there was a problematic BIOS on some IBM P4 systems that after a
few hours messed up the apic's timer interrupt frequency. I believe
booting w/ noapic will work around the issue, but the correct fix is to
update your BIOS.
Please file a bugzilla bug if upgrading your BIOS does resolve the
issue.
