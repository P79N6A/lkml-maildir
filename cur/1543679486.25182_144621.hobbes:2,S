You probably ought to mention that this is only needed by 32 bit architectures 
with silly amounts of memory installed.  On that topic, you might mention 
that the VM subsystem generally gets simpler and in some cases faster (i.e., 
no more highmem mapping cost) in the move to 64 bits.
You also might want to mention pdflush.
