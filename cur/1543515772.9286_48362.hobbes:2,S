You don't know RTLinux, right? It has only very limited IO capabilities.
For normal realtime IO you only need to average bandwight and behaviour of
a disk, realtime system don't need to be a high availablity system. A
hard failure is an exception that must be detected but not necessary
handled.

What I want is better perfomance and response times, what you not only
want to have in the realtime world. It's not a hard problem, then to
optimize the kernel for server or multimedia purposes.
