James, you can erase BIOS flash from linux userland, you could probably
even physically destroy it too. I can think of great ways of physically
destroying one's CPU and maybe even motherboard too, from userland.
This is nothing new.
Is the kernel broken because you can bit-bang the hardware as root? Think
about it.
