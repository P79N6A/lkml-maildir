Well me too, but smalldevfs is a bit stalled at present.
It seems to work OK now, but there are a few small incompatibilities with the
current devfs.  People need to make adjustments to their initscripts, or to
untar a tarball-of-device-nodes into smalldevfs at boot time.
Like all other kernel developers I do not use devfs and am not really able to
evaluate how serious these problems will be for people.
Adam is disinclined to address these administrative incompatibilites in his
user-space tools.  smalldevfs is presently at risk of getting dropped out.
