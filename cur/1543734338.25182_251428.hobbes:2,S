For s390, this was solved by simply defining cpu_relax() to the hypervisor
yield operation, because we found that cpu_relax() is used only in busy-wait
situations where it makes sense to continue on another virtual CPU.
What is the benefit of not always doing a full hypervisor yield when
you hit cpu_relax()?
