If struct boot_params as a whole is useless for kexec, I can move it to
debugfs, because kexec is the only normal user now. Then which fields of
struct boot_params do you think is useful for kexec?
Refer to include/asm-x86/bootparam.h
edid_info?
e820_entries and e820_map?	maybe useful for kdump
edd related fields (eddbuf, edd_mbr_sig_buffer, etc)? split fields until fundamental types?
