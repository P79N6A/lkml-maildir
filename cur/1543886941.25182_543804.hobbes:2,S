This is a really great tool and presents a very intuitive alternative to the 
timer stats file..
On a Core 2 Duo Macbook, Linux always gets around 3.2h battery, OS X about 
4.2h. This tool has identified that uhci_hcd is where 75% of the ticks are 
going when X is not loaded. Unloading uhci_hcd drops the battery life back to 
around 4.2h, but I lose the keyboard.
Is there any way to find out what USB driver is causing usb_uhci to be this 
busy?
(BTW, the link to Keith's patch for dhcdbd seems to be broken on your 
homepage.)
