Subject: [2.6.17.4] Halting process powers-off HDD twice

I'm using the 2.6.17.4 kernel. As of the 2.6.17 release, whenever I
shutdown my system (using the 'halt' command... I didn't change the
'halt' version since the update), my hard-drive powers off, powers
back on, powers off, and then the system is powered down. Usually (<=
2.6.16), the hard-drive would be turned off once, and then the system
powered off.
The hard-drive this problem is occuring on is an IDE Maxtor 6B300R0
hard drive. My .config is attached. Please CC me, as I'm not
subscribed to the list.
