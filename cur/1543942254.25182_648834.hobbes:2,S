Rafael, any progress with this issue? (a few questions below).

cat /proc/$PID/stat ; sleep 3; cat /proc/$PID/stat ?
cat /proc/sched_debug; sleep 3 ; cat /proc/sched_debug
and also cat /proc/$PID/stat taken when this task still looks 'sane' :-/
Do you mean that only SCHED_NORMAL tasks can't run on this cpu or RT
tasks of high prio as well (so that maybe the scheduler is in
inconsistent state) ?
If the latter, the watchdog should have triggered after a while (if
enabled), I guess.

does a stack trace always look like this?
