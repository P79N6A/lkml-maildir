Well, I can't find any other suitable ones, really. I can't seem to
find HighPoints, there is 3ware and DawiControl, but I don't know
which ones are supported by Linux.
Maybe someone can give me a suggestion for a non-promise EIDE 133
PCI controller that's natively supported by Linux.

that's a different driver. so it might be the driver that's causing
the problems. if i replace the controller, i may be able to debug,
but unless i get a new controller in place, i can't do anything
since this is a productive machine.
thanks,
