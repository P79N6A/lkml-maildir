Which is _totally_ redundant for cache_cache.

I don't think its worth it. It doesn't make much sense to create a
separate object cache if you're not using it, we're better off
converting those to kmalloc(). cache_cache is there to make
bootstrapping easier, it is very unlikely that you ever have more than
one page allocated for that cache which is why scanning the freelist
_at all_ is silly. I think SLAB_NO_REAP should go away but we also
must ensure we don't introduce a performance regression while doing
that.
