Which means we can loose several of them. Would it hurt to iterate as
much as possible along the task list,
keeping some care about writers starvation and latency?
BTW I thought about the slow work framework, but I can't retrieve
it....  But this thread has already a slow priority.
Would it be interesting to provide a way for rwlocks to know if there
is writer waiting for the lock?
