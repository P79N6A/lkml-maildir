I sent these in separetely, a month ago, as bug fixes for the dlpar 
crashes in the pre-2.6.14 kernels, but these were never applied.  
Since they're needed to get EEH to work, I just sent them in again 
with this set.  Yes, I'm aware that the patch you sent yesterday
fixes the same bug in almost the same way. 
What you really want to concentrate on are patches 20 through 23
which mess with the guts of the rpaphp code. But again, these are 
the same old patches, they have not changed since the submit last 
month.
