It doesn't barf on me.  I added one other patch on top of yours:
one from Roland Dreier, for arch/i386/kernel/doublefault.c [below].

Looks like arch/i386/kernel/doublefault.c is one place in the code
that hardcodes the assumption that PAGE_OFFSET == 0xC0000000.  Here's
a patch that fixes that.
(Of course this doesn't really fix anything except debugging output)
