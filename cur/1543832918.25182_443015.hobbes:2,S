Subject: [PATCH 4/7] AVR32: Turn off support for DISCONTIGMEM and SPARSEMEM
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/11/181

I just gave CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM a try on AVR32 and it turned out it
didn't compile.
Since there's only a single board available, and that board has no
use for discontigmem or sparsemem anyway, I figured it's better to
just turn it off until a need for it arises.
