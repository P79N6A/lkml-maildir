Did you read what I wrote ? Did I say "its not real time" ? I've said
over and over that I am not interested in this kind of
classification. I'm interested in features and performance, not
semantics.
I said ""hard realtime" normally *implies* a lot more than we need".
The reason why I am not happy with thinking about this as "hard
real-time" is precisely that: making Linux hard real-time involves
fixing way more stuff than the scheduling response. RTLinux is
probably the right approach to producing a Linux-related OS that can
do hard-real-time in the sense that a user of QNX would want to hear
about. 
But nobody here has said anything to convince me that RTLinux is the
right approach to getting the scheduler to be capable of making hard
real time response guarantees.
I am willing to be convinced of this, truly. However, the example of
BeOS keeps nagging me. Those guys do claim "guaranteed" response time
for audio+multimedia apps, but they don't claim to do hard real
time. So, by the terms that you've helped enforce here, either they
are lying, or there is some way to do one without the other.
