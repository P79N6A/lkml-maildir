This is common to all thinkpads (or other laptops which have trackpoint
devices) and also happens under Windows.  The cause is related to
automatic compensation for the centering of the trackpoint.  Early
trackpoint devices didn't have automatic centering and I remember
replacing more than a few keyboards because the mouse would start
drifting by itself.  Later trackpoints have automatic centering, but
if you hold onto the trackpoint for a long time (causing the "center"
to be offset by some amount) and then let go, it will settle back to
the "old center" and the cursor will drift for a few seconds until
the automatic centering kicks in again.
Moral of the story - don't touch the trackpoint when you aren't doing
anything with it.
Cheers, Andreas
