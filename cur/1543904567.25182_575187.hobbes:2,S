there's another side-effect: it likely results in the zapping of 
thousands of dentries that were cached nicely before. So we might 
exchange 'all my apps are swapped out' experience with 'all file access 
is slow'. The latter is _probably_ still an improvement over the 
balooning, but i'm not sure. What we _really_ want is an updatedb that 
does not disturb the dcache.
