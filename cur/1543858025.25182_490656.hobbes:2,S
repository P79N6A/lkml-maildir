I do not know if it will be included or not, but would like to hear an
opinion of people added to Cc: list on that point.
I have a lot of examples from trivial applications to real-world web
server patched with kevent support. Although some applications might not
compile with the latest kevent sources due to interface parameters
changes, it is easily fixable looking into other examples.
According to your task - yes, it can be done through kevent - you need
to create own kevent subsystem if you plan to use something special,
register it with kevent and start commiting events.
But it is easier to use different notification mechanisms for that task:
I suggest using netlink based connector, gennetlink or kobject_uevent,
although the latter is not the best choice definitely, and create own
protocol embedded into that transports.
