Yes. But long ago he wrote:

You need quite a different driver from the 53c710 drivers that
exist, because 53c700 doesn't have DSA register.  I've attached
a diff for 2.4.0-test9 which adds sim700.{c,h,scr}.  That driver
is supposed to handle 53c700 and 53c710 and be a replacement for
sim710.c.

Good! You are well-organized. I also had that someplace.

I am not quite sure what you mean by System Board Id.
The EISA ID of this thing is INT3061.
