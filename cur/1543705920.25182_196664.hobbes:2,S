Ross said in previous mails that he had tried to contact nvidia through 
various methods, and had not recieved a response.
He also mentioned that AMD were being much more responsive, and he had a 
support request open with them, which he was assured was being investigated.
But yeah, doesn't look like we are getting anywhere with the manufacturers...
