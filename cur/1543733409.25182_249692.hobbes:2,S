Actually, you should consider the complete sys_ipc interface deprecated,
just like sys_socketcall and all old_ syscalls. Neither of these should
not be added to any new architecture, because you can simply call the
underlying syscall handlers like sys_socket or sys_semop directly, like
e.g. parisc does.
I guess it would be a good idea to have architecture independent versions
of sys_pipe, sys_mmap and sys_uname in the tree so new architectures
can start with an empty sys_arch.c.
