Oh, boy...  OK, I see what happens and it's _ugly_.  md_probe() is misused
there big way.  The minimal fix is to revert the cleanup in md_probe() -
replace
	int unit = *part;
with
	int unit = MINOR(dev);
However, that is crap solution.  The problem is that md_probe() is called
directly with bogus arguments - not only part is NULL (which triggers the
oops), but dev (which is supposed to be dev_t value) is actually mdidx(mddev).
Cleaner fix follows, but we really need to get the situation with gendisk
allocations into the sane shape there.  Sigh...
