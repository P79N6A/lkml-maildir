Paul, I actually mentioned at the beginning of my email that I did read that thread
started by Peter. I did learn quite a bit from it :)
You guys did not discuss isolation stuff though. The thread was only about scheduling
and my cpu isolation extension patches deal with other aspects. 
Sounds like at this point we're in agreement that sched_load_balance is not suitable
for what I'd like to achieve. But how about making cpusets aware of the cpu_isolated_map ?
Even without my patches it's somewhat of an issue right now. I mean of you use isolcpus= 
boot option to put cpus into null domain, cpusets will not be aware of it. The result maybe 
a bit confusing if an isolated cpu is added to some cpuset.
