Right - but in real-world code, 'y' is the actual problem.

The point you're missing is that you're "fixing" a failure mode that in
general isn't seen, and ignoring the failure mode that *is* seen.

And neither "x" nor "y" is "the set of all still-live pointers to already-freed
memory" - which is why your proposal doesn't actually do anything effective.
