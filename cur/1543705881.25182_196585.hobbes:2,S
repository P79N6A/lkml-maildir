There are a number of variables here.  Certainly, the old
inodes-pinned-by-highmem pagecache will cause this to happen - badly.  2.6
is pretty aggressive at killing off those inodes.
What kernel was it?
Was it a highmem box?  If so, was the filesystem in question placing
directory pagecache in highmem?  If so, that was really bad on older 2.4:
the directory pagecache in highmem pins down all directory inodes.
