Because it's now defunct <Z>, a zombie, waiting for somebody to
reap its return status. You are almost there, you need to issue
the kernel equivalent of waitpid() (sys_waitpid) to grab that
status and throw it away. That's what the code I showed you
did when it would shut down and remove a module that had
a kernel thread.
