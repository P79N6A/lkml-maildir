Lots of such error or warning messages scroll away.  All that it takes
is use of egrep "foo|bar" to look for the interesting messages
or egrep -v "foo|bar" to discard the uninteresting (normal) messages.
I do that all the time and I think that it's the right thing to do,
not have the tools regurgitate something that they have already said.
