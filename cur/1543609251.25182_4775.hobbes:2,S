Hi All,
after a period of instability due to SMP and a
3Com ethernet card I upgraded to 2.4.10. But
now the system consistantly hangs on boot
during the modprobe of the hisax/isdn module.
Hanging means total lockup of the system (no
dump, nothing).
The same happens in 2.4.13.  The card works fine
in another (uniprocessor) system. The
ISDN card is a HFC-PCI. Changing position
of the PCI cards doesn't help.
Looks like a kernel problem to me.
Any suggestions
  Arjen
