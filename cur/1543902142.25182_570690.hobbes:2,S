I have a tiny question triggered in my mind after seeing following, sorry if 
this was disccussed before;
config KVM
    tristate "Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) support"
    depends on X86 && EXPERIMENTAL
    depends on X86_CMPXCHG64 || 64BIT
If i'm not wrong X86_CMPXCHG64 depends on CONFIG_X86_PAE which depends on 
HIGHMEM64 and again if i'm not wrong this means distributions who wants to 
provide KVM must enable CONFIG_X86_PAE and CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G from now on?
Is this intentional or this is here because of an assumption like "processors 
supports virtualization already provides PAE", could you please enlighten me?
Cheers
