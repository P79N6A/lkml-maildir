The description of the NICs in question as found in
/etc/sysconfig/hwconf
are:
3Com Corporation|3c900B-TPO [Etherlink XL TPO]
3Com Corporation|3c905C-TX [Fast Etherlink]
In one machine it's the first which is getting lots of overruns; in the
other it's the second.  Depends on which one is connected to the network
with 60% usage.
 The machines are dual-processor capable, but only a few of them have 2
processors inside.  Yes, they're using standard IDE drives.  (I've been
telling the people at my company we *need* SCSI drives forever...  :-P)
 I don't think the 3c95x driver uses promiscuous mode for multicasting, or
does it ?
 BTW I'm not sure I understand Documentation/networking/multicast.txt.  
(Is it still up-to-date ?)  I suppose IP-MRoute, and thus AllMulti's only
relevant for routers while IP-Multicast is relevant for nodes transmitting
and receiving multicast.  So that means for nodes "hardware filters really
help", so we really shouldn't be using 3c59x-drivers, right ?  Am I 
correct that Intel EtherExpress Pro 10/100 cards would be a better choice ?

Do I understand correctly that those Rx buffers are DMA buffers provided
by the kernel ?

So it's included in linux-2.2.17.tar.gz, is it ?  Is it also included in
any of the 2.4.0-test kernels ?

Pentium III 450MHz dual-processor.  I thought there might be some locking
problem with the SMP code, so I installed a single-processor kernel.  
Problem didn't go away though.

What's the RX_RING_SIZE used for ?

Both NICs have their own IRQ.

I suppose IDE drives have slow ISRs ?  Does unmasking the IRQs for hd's
work reliably with most of today's IDE drives and controllers ?  The IDE
controller is an "Intel Corporation|82371AB PIIX4 IDE".

Hmmm...  I suppose when this happens it's normal a lot of overruns occur ?
Upgrading the driver will make the networking stable, but I suppose that
won't prevent a lot of multicast UDP packets from getting dropped, or will
it ?  (Though unmasking the hd IRQ might.)

Ok.

I sure will.  Thanks,
