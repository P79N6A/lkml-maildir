This is my understanding of the situation, which is not gospel but 
interpretation of the information data I have had available.
Reiserfs3.6 is in maintenance mode. Its performance was very good in 2.4 
days, but since 2.6 the block layer has matured so much that the code 
paths that were fast in reiserfs are no longer so impressive compared to 
those shared by ext3.
In terms of recommendation, the latency of non-preemptible codepaths 
will be fastest in ext3 in 2.6 due to the nature of it constantly being 
examined, addressed and updated. That does not mean it has the fastest 
performance by any stretch of the imagination. XFS, I believe, has 
significantly faster large file performance, and reiser3.6 has 
significantly faster small file performance. But if throughput is not a 
problem, and latency is, then ext3 is a better choice. Reiser4 is a 
curious beast with obviously high throughput, but for the moment I do 
not think it is remotely suitable for low latency applications.
As for the %full issue; no filesystem works well as it approaches full 
capacity. Performance degrades dramatically beyond 75% on all of them, 
becoming woeful once beyond 85%. If you're looking for good performance, 
more free capacity is more effective than changing filesystems.
All of this should be taken into consideration if you're worried about 
low latency cpu scheduling, as it all will collapse if your filesystem 
code has high latency in the kernel. It also would make benchmarking low 
latency cpu scheduling potentially prone to disastrous mis-interpretation.
Cheers,
Con
