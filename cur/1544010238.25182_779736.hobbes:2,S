Hmm, OK. I think we ended up agreeing after some review and things
fixed since my original posting.
But it was an honest question -- is this too late to go in 2.6.28,
given that it has been present in earlier releases too? Maybe if the
release date is pushed to after Christmas, then there is enough time.
Otherwise, perhaps it should go upstream afterwards, then filter into
-stable?
Anyway, I'll repost them, in case you'd care to put them in -mm in
the meantime.
