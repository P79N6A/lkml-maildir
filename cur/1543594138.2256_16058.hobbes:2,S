Hi Andrew,
Thanks for your email. I am aware of the "traditions" of the Linux kernel,
and this is really why I wanted to start a discussion going about this.
Basically one of the things I am wondering is how complex the kernel code
can grow to become. All I am proposing is that old features start becoming
deprecated and eventually removed.
What I'd like to know is this -- will support for the i386, say, ever go
away? What if the hardware is no longer in existence/used by anyone? will
support stay in the kernel?
This is the main point I wanted to make, and I guess I should have been
clearer about this.
Daniel
