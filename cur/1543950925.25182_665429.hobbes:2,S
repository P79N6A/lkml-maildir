You can also use autoboot
ftp://ftp.firstfloor.org/pub/ak/autoboot/autoboot-1.tgz
[hmm I think it's a slightly older version, but should not 
be too difficult to adapt]
These are the scripts we use for automatic testing regularly in Nuernberg.
It's a little different from Ingo's setup I think though and you
really need to use remote controllable power switches for it to work
well [I personally use some cheap USB controlled ones]
