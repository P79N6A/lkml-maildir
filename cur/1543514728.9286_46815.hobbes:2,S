For sleep_on() to work reliably in SMP, it should accept a reference to
some lock that ensures that the test of the condition and the thread
sleeping are executed atomically. But may-be there are situations where we
know about the waker not being in race and sleep_on() then may be safe.
For UP, disabling interrupts does the trick.
Even the sequence that works does not seem fine to me, since it looks like
SMP synchronisation relying simply on memory ordering, and I cannot
beleive this to work in all situations and on any kind of hardwares and
architectures. Indeed it is not so, but I do prefer semantics that
explicitely refers to locks for SMP synchronisations.
