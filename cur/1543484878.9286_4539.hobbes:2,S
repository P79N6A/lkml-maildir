Subject: A minor 2.2.1 question: defaults in 2.2.1 configuration

I downloaded 2.2.1 from one of kernel.org's mirrors, and installed it.
One minor question: it seems to me that a lot of times that I hit "?"
during "make config" to see what some option did, the help text's
suggestion as to what I should set the option to if I wasn't sure differed
from the default that config was suggesting.  Is the help text out of
date, or did someone use the wrong settings for the defaults when they
paackaged the kernel, or what?
