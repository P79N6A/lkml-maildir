I think this is a good point Stephen is making.
So we have:
* write this particular page at this particular memory address (for DMA 
setup or other reasons).
* write the data on this page
* apply X units of aging pressure to the subcache if it is distinct from 
the general cache and supports a pressure operation.
as the three distinct needs we are needing to serve in the design of the 
interface.
Rik, are you comfortable now with this cache plugin approach I am 
advocating now that I have explained it is motivated by the need to 
handle objects that are not flushed in pages?  You have had another day 
to think about it, and you didn't quite say yes (though it did seem you 
no longer think me crazy).
