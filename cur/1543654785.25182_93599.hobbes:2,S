nope, no oops, no crash, afaik no unstable kernel/drivers. Kernel is yours ;) 
and drivers, hmm, just intel i815, eepro100. That happend after some hours of 
uptime and just doing "rm -rf linux-old"

Yep, I always do a forced fsck in case of that.

I run e2fsck -fy every time after a crash. Fortunately it doesn't happen so 
often :-)

yep. I tried to remove that 00_umount-against-unused-dirty-inodes-race fix and 
after that (now 5 hours uptime) doing only copying and deleting, that ext3fs 
error is away.

seems it's a problem in the umount-against-unused-dirty-inodes-race fix or if 
the fix "is the right way" the problem is located somewhere else what 
triggers the problem of your patch.
