The problem is that this would need to be done for all variants
(write, writev, aio_write, send{,msg,to} etc.) Same for read. I probably forgot
one or two.

And iptables, although that would be probably *really* ugly.
It's a bit of a sore spot on x86-64 though. 64bit kernel with full
32bit userland works usually great except for iptables and ipsec.
