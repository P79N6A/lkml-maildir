There is no distinction between compilation and runtime in the standard.
Actually, C could be interpreted, or a very smart compiler could also
think real hard and replace the whole program by an equivalent printf().
Besides, a standard (C99) compiler will reject the 'main' definition.
At least, the return type cannot be implicit anymore.
