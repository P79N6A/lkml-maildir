Yes, it works if I compile speedstep-ich as module. I've put the module 
in initramfs and as soon it is loaded, the ondemand governor is selected 
and works.
However, do you think it's ok to prevent cpufreq drivers to be built-in 
if ondemand governor is selected as default? Another way would be to 
reorganise the initialisation code so that workqueue is initialised 
before the cpufreq framework is started, do you think it's possible?
See you,
Eric
