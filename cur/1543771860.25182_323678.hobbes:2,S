That's weird.  So, is your /dev/sda a (S)ATA drive?
I haven't tried it on 2.6.12-rc*  (breaks VMware for me+ libata-dev),
but it does work fine for 2.6.11 + libata-dev on my PATA drive.
Maybe there's something screwy with true SATA drives and libata (doubtful)?
I also have "smartctl -data" working with SATA drives through the
qstor driver (the non-libata version) without any issues, so we know
the drives themselves are happy with it.

Same thing as "-data".  Either works.
