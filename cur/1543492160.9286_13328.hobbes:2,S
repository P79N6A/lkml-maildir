The messages are occurring because your NFS client is trying to use
the 'rpc.lockd' protocol for file locking.  Upgrading your server will
not help get rid of these messages. Rather, you need to run an
'rpc.statd' daemon on the client (and on the host) in order to monitor
the locks if you want to use NFS file locking. Linux does not support
locking using unmonitored locks.
If not, you should rather be mounting the partitions with NFS file
locking disabled. On linux clients, this is done using the 'nolock'
mount option:
	mount -t nfs -onolock my:/foo /bar
NB: The Linux userland NFS server does not support file locking, so
you always want to use the 'nolock' option when mounting from such a
host (and you won't need the 'statd' daemon. Only the knfsd server
currently supports file locking under Linux.
Cheers,
