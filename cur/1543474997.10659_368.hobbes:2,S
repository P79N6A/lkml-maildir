Subject: VM: Linus versus ArcA on kernel compiles in 64MB

(Again, this isn't really a very good test. I know.  I just haven't made
a better one yet, like kernel compiles in 32Mb.  But I do have netscape
running in the background to hog some memory.)
	I tried Linus's official pre4, and I get basically the same results.  I
suspect that Linus's version is better because SOMETHING should be
swapped; I have lots of unused daemons like 'xfstt'.
	On the other hand, Linus's version also swaps out at least 2 MB on
doing wc /usr/bin/* to make room for worthless page cache pages.  This
may be a good thing... Perhaps it only goes up the "right" amount of
swap and then stops.  However, some pieces of netscape needed to be
swapped back in afterwards, which I think should not happen.  Perhaps
that is the best that we can do with only 1 bit of age information?
	Anyway, here are my test results... I'm not quite sure how to interpret
the differences between the 'shared' and 'cached' values for Linus and
ArcA.
