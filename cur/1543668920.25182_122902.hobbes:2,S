I can't find the original bug report.  I thought it had to do with 
bonding, but my search came up empty.  Any help?
It bugs me that someone is calling dev->close without calling dev->open.  
On the other hand, the driver shouldn't knock everyone down just because
the caller is misbehaved, and this fix isn't in the perf path, so the
patch is good insurance.  Let's go back and figure out who was calling
dev->open out of turn.
