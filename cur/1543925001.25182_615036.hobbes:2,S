Each vcpu will register a page on its own. In the guest side, it will be
an array of pages. So, we make it page sized.

There's no requirements on the host part at all. So it doesn't really
matter. In the next version, I may make it even a simple pointer.

It deals with the start of the structure, but not with its size. See the
guest part: Where it matters, I do use it.
