The reset of uptime is probably a Good Thing.  Consider the case of
a kernel memory leak - you look in /proc/meminfo and find that you've managed
to lose 64 meg of memory to the leak.  Where you start looking for the
leak will depend on whether it's 64 meg lost across 4 weeks since the
last boot, or the 30 minutes since the last boot.
(Speaking as somebody who's run into both classes of leaks...)
