Yes, they're rather different and would require additional APIs for
controlling some of the features, though it may be that we can get away
with doing a lot of the configuration in platform data or board init
code with a more limited subset configured dynamically by the USB stack.

Yes, that needs to be investigated.  I'd hope there's *some* similarity
since at the end of the day it's all USB but I've not got to the point
of looking at that yet.
