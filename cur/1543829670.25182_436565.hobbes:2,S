Well, maintainer mentioned that we do not export more documents more than
what is available on LSI site. That site contains product specification,
installation guides, user guides etc but not a technical document which
gives insight into the various registers and what a driver writer
can do with the device.
I have also sent mails regarding my problem to linux-scsi list as well
as to people working on megaraid but but no response. :-(

Somebody hinted that think of PCI bus reset. But I think PCI bus reset will
require firware/BIOS to export a hook to software to so initiate PCI bus
reset and I don't think many platforms do that. Infact I am not even aware
of one platform who does that.
