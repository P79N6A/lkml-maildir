Hi,
notebook manufacturer seems to built a newer Wacom pen enabled tablet to
recent tablet pcs which are not recognized by the serial pnp driver.
Attached is a patch which makes the newer Wacom WACF007 and WACF008
tablets useable with the serial driver. The device is fully compatible
with it.
This is a resent of my mail two weeks ago to 'linux-serial' :)
