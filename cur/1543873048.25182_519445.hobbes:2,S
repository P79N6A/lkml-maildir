It seem Mike has chosen to go silent so I'll guess on his part. 
nice on my debian etch seems to choose nice +10 without arguments contrary to 
a previous discussion that said 4 was the default. However 4 is a good value 
to use as a base of sorts.
What I propose is as a proportion of nice 0:
nice 4 1/2
nice 8 1/4
nice 12 1/8
nice 16 1/16
nice 20 1/32 (of course nice 20 doesn't exist)
and we can do the opposite in the other direction
nice -4 2
nice -8 4
nice -12 8
nice -16 16
nice -20 32
Assuming no further discussion is forthcoming I'll implement that along with 
Al's suggestion for staggering the latencies better with nice differences 
since the two are changing the same thing.
