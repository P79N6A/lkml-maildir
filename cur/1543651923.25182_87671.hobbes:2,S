When I enable shared 3rd-level pagetables between processes KDE 3.0.x and KDE 
3.1 beta2 at least do not work.
Especially "ksmserver" do not start anylonger.
Taken from my root's .xsession-errors file:
Mutex destroy failure: Device or resource busy
Mutex destroy failure: Device or resource busy
kdeinit: Pipe closed unexpectedly: No such file or directory
kdeinit: Pipe closed unexpectedly: Success
KInit could not launch 'ksmserver'.
kdeinit: Fatal IO error: client killed
ICE default IO error handler doing an exit(), pid = 4489, errno = 2
ICE default IO error handler doing an exit(), pid = 4497, errno = 0
kdeinit: Communication error with launcher. Exiting!
