Looks saneish to me.  I'd like to see thorough benchmark results when it is
complete.  And it would be nice to make address_space.binding go away if
!CONFIG_NUMA.
The explicit knowledge of ZONE_DMA/ZONE_NORMAL/ZONE_HIGHMEM in get_zonetype()
should not be necessary - you don't want it to explode if ZONE_DMA32 is
added.  It should be indexing into node_zonelists in some manner.
Will this code work if all memory is in ZONE_DMA, as some architectures do?
