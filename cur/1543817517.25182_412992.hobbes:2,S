Subject: bridge+netfilter broken for IP fragments in 2.6.16?

Hello,
I have set up a bridge with two ports:
# brctl show br0
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
br0             8000.000021f23d58       no              eth1
                                                        tap1
Using 2.6.16/.1 non fragmented IP packets are passing the bridge without
problems, but fragmented IP packets do not show up on the outgoing
interface. E.g., for fragmented traffic coming in from tap1 and going
out via eth1 tcpdump shows:
  1) on tap1: fragmented packets
  2) on br0: the defragmented packet (connection tracking)
  3) on eth1: no packet!?
This breaks IPsec connections for example.
Doing the same on 2.6.15.x shows:
  1) on tap1: fragmented packets
  2) on br0: the defragmented packet (connection tracking)
  3) on eth1: fragmented packets
and IPsec connections are ok.
If I disable netfilter for bridged traffic in 2.6.16/.1 
# echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables 
then the fragmented traffic passes the bridge without problems.
Is this a known issue?
