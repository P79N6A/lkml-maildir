Hi,
  I'm trying to debug a weird problem with Xine - its screwing up its use
of shared memory for regions I haven't sussed yet.  One odd consequence is
that it has apparently successfully managed to allocate a 0 byte chunk of
shared memory; shmat is then called with shmaddr=0 and shmflg=0; the
result of shmat is 0
  Is this what shmat is supposed to do in this (admittedly odd)
circumstance? The error behaviour is defined in the man page as returning
-1 on error.
(Linux/Alpha 2.4.0-test8)
Back to trying to find out why it decided to allocate a  0 byte chunk....
Dave
