I wasn't suggesting that, I was confirming you're not going looking at
the ptes somewhere I didn't notice.

Really.  Since that is what the PG_dirty bit is supposed to be telling us.

It sure isn't just now, and it's likely to remain that way for quite some 
time.

One day, in a perfect world, you will dirty a mmap, fsync it, and the data  
will appear in the blink of an eye, somewhere else.  Till then it would be 
nice just to get mmaps of NFS files doing something reasonable.  We do get 
around to walking the ptes at file close I believe.  Is that not driven by 
zap_page_range, which moves any orphaned pte dirty bits down into the struct 
page?
