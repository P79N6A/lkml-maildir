What about Larry making available a special version of BK that would only be
able to perform checkouts?  
This special version could have a less controversial license, even be GPL
with source.  This only to provide a tool to extract data out of public BK
repositories (like Linus' kernel repository) for people who don't intend or
aren't willing to actually use the real value of the full fledged BK.
