There is also the issue of compiled code which explicitly raises and
lowers capabilities around critical code sections (ie., as they were
intended to be used) is also not well served by this change.
That is, unless the code was compiled with things like CAP_MAC_ADMIN
being #define'd then it won't be able to do things like cap_set_flag()
appropriately.
Cheers
