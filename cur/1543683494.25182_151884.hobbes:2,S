This looks fine for normal harddrives put on flash you'd probably like
to write the data evenly over the free space in some already formatted
section still leaving the oportunity to format some other sectors to not
run out of space.

A device layer that shuffles around sectors would have interesting
semantics, like hardly being portable because one would have to use
exactly the same device driver with the same parameters to use the
filesystem and thus retrieve the data.
