It may be widely used and still ugly. The general problem with
DEFINE_FOO() macros is that they obfuscate things: they do not _look_
like C variable declarations, and, in particular, type of variable is
not immediately obvious.
The only reasonable case where DEFINE_FOO(x) is really necessary is when
initializer uses address of x, but even in that case something like
        spinlock_t guard = SPINLOCK_UNLOCKED(guard);
is much more readable than
        DEFINE_SPIN_LOCK(guard);
The question is: does RT really have to force DEFINE_* as the only way
to define things?
