The following will change all 'cont' words to your choice (I doubt
you want to use 'XXXX' as I did here) in cgroup.c:
    sed -i -r 's/(\W|^)cont(\W|$)/\1XXXX\2/g' kernel/cgroup.c
I can't say for sure, but I suspect that if cgroups had always
been cgroups (short for control groups), then these local 'cont'
variables would have a different name.  One can often, as in this
case, find some justification for most any name.  The question is
which name is most quickly and easily understood.
... yes ... I'm a stickler for names ... sorry.
