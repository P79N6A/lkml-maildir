Hi Drew,
thanks a lot for your good feedback. See comments below.
I'll try to provide an updated version next week. It would
be nice if you could post a patch for your driver once
we have addressed the issues you mentioned. Then we would
have the eHEA driver for the SKB interface, and your driver
for the "receive in pages" interface.
Thanks,
Jan-Bernd

The modifications you propose are not sufficient to work with HW
which actually extracts the VLAN IDs but does not change the 
eth protocol. Thus we have to add an additional field in
lro_mgr indicating how to interpret the eth protocol regarding
the VLAN header.

I think I missed something :-) Will fix that.
In lro_tcp_ip_check we check for the "SKB aggregation interface"
the skb->len against ip->tot_len. This catches padded frames as
eth_type_trans(skb, dev) reduces the length of the SKB.
However, the possible VLAN header is not taken into account. 
And for the "receive in pages" interface a wrong length is passed
as argument as well. 
I'd suggest to reject padded frames for aggregation as we do now
(when bugs are fixed) and thus keep the code simple.
I guess that padded frames don't occur too often in high load 
situations. If we detect a real performance issue we can still
change that later.

len: number of bytes received
true_size: used to fill the "truesize" field in the SKB. Thus this reflects
           the amount of memory that is actually used by that SKB. If you
           receive into pages und you have some space between packets, you
           should take this into account. Example: you use 1 page for each
           packet, then you pass 4096 as argument.

Yes, I see the point... I'm not sure in how far there are any requirements
that a certain amount of data (header) for other types of traffic
has to be in the skb->data field and not in frags. Maybe someone
can comment on this?
I suggest to remove LRO_MIN_PG_HLEN for tcp/ip packets that are aggregated,
but should we use a minimal length for other traffic (depending on the
number of received bytes)? Is that necessary?

Yes, if someone intends to use it without napi, we can add this.

This suggestions sounds good. Will add it.
