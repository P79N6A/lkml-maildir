Something like this:
o1	A1 B1 C1 D1
o2	A1 A2 B1 B2
	C2 C1 D2 D1
o3	A1 A2 A3 B1
	B2 B3 C1 C2
	C3 D1 D2 D3
o4	A1 A2 A3 A4
	B2 B3 B4 B1
	C3 C4 C1 C2
	D4 D1 D2 D3
(columns are drives, numbers are stripes, LETTERS are chunks of data).

Yes, some people can not stomach running degraded at any time, so they could 
set the delay for the first duplicate stripe to 0, and subsequent stripes at 
leasure.
