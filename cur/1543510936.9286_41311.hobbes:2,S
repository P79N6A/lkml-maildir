*This* problem (same config option available for different architectures)
does not exist in the current (newest 2.3.18-ac) version of xconfig parser...
However, the
if [ "$CONFIG_VAR_1" = "y" ]; then
   bool 'Some option' CONFIG_VAR_2
else
   tristate 'Some option' CONFIG_VAR_2
fi
is still a problem caused by the initial xconfig design
(of course only if CONFIG_VAR_1 *can* be defined).
Modifying this design seems not to be worth required work if a tool 
replacing xconfig can be available soon (mconfig).
