I had to write the oops down by hand so it is possible that some
of the addresses could be wrong.
This happens right at boot time.  It only happens when I don't a
hardware reset.  It doesn't happen with "shutdown -r".  Wierd.
The machine is a AMD-K6-2 with 128MB of memory and a VIA MB.  If
any more information is needed I can provide it.
