I get the same error, when I compile sound into the kernel, I believe it
is a problem with the pnp stuff that the driver uses, aparently its been
trying 1.3 as an irq. Though when I use the driver as a module it works, until 
after I play a song using mpg123, then it comps out with the same error.
It worked in 2.1.8? and 2.0.?, but 2.1.9+ and 2.2 break it a bit.
HELP.

        A manager went to his programmers and told them: "As regards to
your work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and
leave at five in the afternoon."  At this, all of them became angry and several
resigned on the spot.
        So the manager said: "All right, in that case you may set your own
working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule."  The
programmers, now satisfied, began to come in a noon and work to the wee
hours of the morning.
