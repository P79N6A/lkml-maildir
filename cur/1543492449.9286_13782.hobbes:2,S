This week I:

----------
Produced the fancy new tv grids that Dave spoke about.
Talked w/two folks from GO about some new ventures
Wrote up Zip2 memo for Stew
Found and reported a few odd channel logos
Merged in a few other patches from Jeff
Created list of data processing steps to be filled in by Jeff, Dave, and co.
Read Dave's 1st i18n draft.
Fixed problem with ! channels (bang channels) w/help from Dave
Reported oddity in grids when one position has multiple channels on
different times (especially bad when it also splits on different days of
the week.) Suggested possible workaround.
Student.Com
-----------
Lots of work producing new music templates
Deconstructed new section, subsection, article templates w/Grif, et all
Unlinked Party Guide package from surveys
Modifed ad() to serve Discover card ad
Cleaned up ad() to remove old cruft and organize it nicer.
Fixed cosmetic error on Discussions for non-signed in users
Read Acuity & KOZ memos (iChat). Apparently: Stew, Eric, and Dave are all
on their list, so I got a 5 forwarded copies of the two memos. :)
SNP, LLC
--------
Interviewed Ashley from Stanford for summer internship
Chatted about StudentAdvantage, LLC IP
Chatted about better names for Student.Net Publishing
Thanked Allah when the water arrived. (I could not come to the water, so
the water came to me.)
