Hello,
I have tried 2.2.9-ac1 with iozone over NFS today and the client just crashes
in a few seconds, without any OOPSES or whatever outputs.
ping is sill OK, VT switching as well. Hitting <return> on the 'Login'
prompt (mingetty) does not show the 'Password' prompt. CTRL-ALT-DEL does
not work.
2.2.6 behaves correctly. The NFS server is a 2.0.36 with unfsd.
I will try again and run tcpdump.
A+,
