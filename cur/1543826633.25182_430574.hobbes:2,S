Looks like the only patch in mm3 touching it is:
fix-kbuild-dependencies-for-synclink-drivers.
BTW: selecting CONFIG_HDLC without selecting at least one protocol
does nothing good (except that the thing actually builds). As I said,
I'd rather let the user decide what it's needed.
Hmm, with 2.6.17-rc5-mm3 it builds fine here (~ up-to-date FC5, i386):
$ egrep '^C.*(SYNCLINK|HDLC)' .config
CONFIG_HDLC=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINK=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_HDLC=y
CONFIG_SYNCLINKMP=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINKMP_HDLC=y
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_GT=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_GT_HDLC=y
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_CS=m
CONFIG_SYNCLINK_CS_HDLC=y
Are you sure it's not a corrupted build tree or something like that?
Can I have a look at the complete .config? Or some other bugzilla #?
There is exactly zero magic in generic HDLC, things are just build
and exported as any other symbol in the tree.
