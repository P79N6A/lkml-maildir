I'm talking about do_anonymous_page, do_wp_page, do_no_page fork and all
the other places that introduces spinlocks (per-page) and allocations of
2 pieces of ram rather than just 1 (and in turn potentially global
spinlocks too if the cpu-caches are empty). Just grep for
pte_chain_alloc or page_add_rmap in mm/memory.c, that's what I mean, I'm
not talking about pagetables.
