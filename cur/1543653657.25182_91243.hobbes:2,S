First off, there's very little unobservable randomness in those disk
ops, especially in a file/webserver context, so the value of
add_disk_randomness is questionable.

Done that.

I have a rewrite that fails safe and is lockless. But this is nothing
compared to the completely broken entropy accounting in
xfer_secondary_pool. Try this: cat /dev/random, wait for it to block,
and then tap your mouse.

Disagree. Did you look at the mixing function? It'll dirty a large
chunk of cache.
