It seems likely that this kernel was built to enable DMA on disk only, 
an option which is appropriate for a vendor kernel, I guess, but results 
in this behaviour.
In any case it appears that an unexpected feature of PIO mode is now 
behaving in a more useful way, so your report was of general benefit. I 
suspect many people may be unhappy with the CPU used to burn CDs with 
that kernel config, particularly on fast burners.
