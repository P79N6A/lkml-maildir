If you want to support those, you must as well tell gcc with a special
flag to never do byte access. I doubt it'd be a good idea to ship a
single kernel that runs on both those ancient cpus and on the more
recent ones too.
The race was mostly theoretical even for alpha, the current PF_MEMDIE
race in mainline triggering in all x86 and all other actual
architectures, is more likely to trigger infact and it has a huge
priority compared to the alpha ev4 SMP race.
But I'm going to fix the ev4 SMP alpha cpus soon by following Linus's
suggestion to reuse the bitflag arrays we already allocated for similar
stuff.
