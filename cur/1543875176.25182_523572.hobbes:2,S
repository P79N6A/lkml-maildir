Hello,
   it is bug in the emulation.  It should be fixed in Workstation 6.0 RC1.  If you
want to use VMware's LSILogic emulation with older products, you need fix below until
new releases come out (or unless I'll put out binary patch to fix binaries to
return 16 instead of previous value).

If port reports that no devices are connected to it, assume that 16 devices
are there.  Hopefully nobody will ever build device with port but no devices,
and even for them it should be safe as before code always probed 16 devices
regardless of MaxDevices reported by port facts.
