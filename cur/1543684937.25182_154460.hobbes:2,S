Eventually, you'll want them, and if it's only to lower the
chip or pin count.

You might be able to get them for free ;-) Just pick the
rejects where the FPU or such doesn't quite work. Call it
amd64sx :-)
But even if you get regular CPUs, they're not *that*
expensive. Particularly not for a first generation design.

Yes, this, chip count, and chip surface are what make me feel
queasy when thinking of somebody using something as powerful
as an amd64.

You want to be API and probably even ABI-compatible, so that
user-space demons (routing, management, etc.) work, too.

I'd think thrice before buying a card that requires me to
change my entire network management system - and change it
again, if I ever decide to switch brands, or if the next
generation of that special NIC gets a little more special.

You can probably afford rather fancy TOE hardware for the
price of ten cluster nodes, a high-speed LAN to connect
your cluster, and a switch that connects the high-speed
link to the ten not-quite-so-high-speed links.
Likewise for power, cooling, and space.
And that's still assuming you can actually distribute all
this.
