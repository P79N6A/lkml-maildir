  ok, i can do that.  but, at the very least, it might be worth it for
some people to stop including moduleparam.h in their code when that
code does nothing with module parameters.  my scanning script picked
out the following files under drivers/ that *seem* to be doing just
that, so respective maintainers might want to toss those useless
includes.  (obviously, at the moment, *all* includes of moduleparam.h
are useless, but the ones in the files below are *doubly* useless. :-)
