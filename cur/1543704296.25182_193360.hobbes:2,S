I just realized this wasn't clear.  I envision a new set of headers in 
the kernel that are clean to export to userland.  The current headers 
then include the appropriate userland-clean ones, and everything below 
that is kernel only.
This lets the kernel maintain the userland-clean headers explicitly, and 
we don't have the work of cleaning them up for glibc.
