umm...
	CPU0:			CPU1:
	spin_lock(a->lock);	spin_lock(b->lock);
	spin_lock(b->lock);	spin_lock(a->lock);
bad.
	CPU0:			CPU1:
	spin_lock(global_lock)	spin_lock(global_lock);
	spin_lock(a->lock);	spin_lock(b->lock);
	spin_lock(b->lock);	spin_lock(a->lock);
Is OK.
	CPU0:			CPU1:
	spin_lock(global_lock)	
	spin_lock(a->lock);	spin_lock(b->lock);
	spin_lock(b->lock);	spin_unlock(b->lock);
				spin_lock(a->lock);
				spin_unlock(a->lock);
also OK.
As long as all code paths which can take two-or-more locks are all covered
by the global lock there is no deadlock scenario.  If a thread takes just a
single instance of one of these locks without taking the global_lock then
there is also no deadlock.
Now, if we need to take both anon_vma->lock AND i_mmap_lock in the newly
added mm_lock() thing and we also take both those locks at the same time in
regular code, we're probably screwed.
