Subject: poll() behaves differently in Linux 2.4.1 vs. Linux 2.2.14 (POLLHUP)

Hi,
  I've noticed that poll() calls on IPv4 sockets do
not behave the same under linux 2.4 vs. linux 2.2.14. 
Linux 2.4 will return POLLHUP for a socket that is not
connected (and has never been connected) while Linux
2.2 will not.
  The following example program demonstrates the
problem when it's run under linux 2.4:
---
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <sys/poll.h>
int main(
  int argc,
  char **argv) 
{
  int s;
  int rv;
  struct pollfd pfd;
  
  s = socket(PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0);
  pfd.fd = s;
  pfd.events = 0;
  rv = poll(&pfd,1,1);
  printf("rv = %d
",rv);
  if(pfd.revents&POLLIN) {printf("pollin
");}
  if(pfd.revents&POLLPRI){printf("pollpri
");}
  if(pfd.revents&POLLOUT){printf("pollout
");}
  if(pfd.revents&POLLERR){printf("pollerr
");}
  if(pfd.revents&POLLHUP){printf("pollhup
");}
  close(s);
}
(copy text to file, run 'gcc -o example example.c', to
compile)
Under Linux 2.4 (specifically 2.4.1) this program will
output:
rv = 0
pollhup
Under Linux 2.2.14 it outputs:
rv = 0
Other operating systems (not that they are necessarily
correct) also output the same as Linux 2.2.14.  I
tried this on FreeBSD 4.4.1, Solaris 5.7 (on a SPARC),
and Windows 2000 with Cygwin 1.1.7.
I'm not sure what POSIX says about this behavior...
This can be traced back to the poll implementation in
the Linux kernel:
In 2.2.14:
net/ipv4/tcp.c[line 580]:
	if (sk->shutdown & RCV_SHUTDOWN)
		mask |= POLLHUP;
vs.
In 2.4.1:
net/ipv4/tcp.c[line 586]:
	 * NOTE. Check for TCP_CLOSE is added. The goal is to
prevent
	 * blocking on fresh not-connected or disconnected
socket. --ANK
	 */
	if (sk->shutdown == SHUTDOWN_MASK || sk->state ==
TCP_CLOSE)
		mask |= POLLHUP;
The behavior observed at user-level matches his
comment as POLLHUP is returned for a fresh
not-connected socket.
What's the reasoning for this change in behavior?  I
know of ways of getting around it, but I wanted to
bring this to everyone's attention.
thanks,
-jeff
