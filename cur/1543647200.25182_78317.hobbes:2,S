This bit?
# This patch includes the following deltas:
#                  ChangeSet    1.713   -> 1.714
#       arch/i386/math-emu/poly.h       1.3     -> 1.4
#
Any idea how to get it other than 'bk export -tpatch | sed' ?
I need to do some real work... play with ths script and sort it out between 
yourselves :)
