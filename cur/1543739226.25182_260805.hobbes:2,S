the sched.c chunks below are still needed. prof=schedule must be driven
from schedule(), not from setscheduler().
The profile.c one is a cleanup. [ and you surely must be a great fan of
profiler cleanups by now B-) ]
the patch applies to 2.6.9-rc4 cleanly as well, and the sched.c bits are
necessary there too. I have tested this patch with and without
prof=schedule and it now produces the expected results:
   314 work_resched                              14.2727
   389 log_wait_commit                            1.2006
   391 kjournald                                  0.6872
   499 need_resched                               9.9800
  1549 worker_thread                              2.5310
  1649 wait_for_completion                        7.4615
  2551 do_exit                                    2.6435
  2999 schedule_timeout                          16.7542
  3073 io_schedule                               64.0208
  7863 preempt_schedule                         126.8226
the above is the scheduling profile of a bootup. ~40% of the reschedules
were caused by PREEMPT, ~20% by IO and the remaining ~40% by process
communication.
without this patch the output is a boring empty profile ...
