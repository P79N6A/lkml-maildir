well, as Muli pointed out in another thread, the problem is when
ALSA=y but GAMEPORT=m.  and, in such a case, there is a difference
between with and without CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT condition.
if CONFIG_SOUND_GAMEPORT is used, the ALSA module will be forced to be
m, so that the gameport is supported.
if we drop this condition check, the ALSA will be kept as y, and the
gameport support will be simply dropped, too.
i think it would be better if we can show warnings about this
confliction instead of dropping the functionality silently.
but if there is no way.... hmm, difficult to say which is better
behavior.
