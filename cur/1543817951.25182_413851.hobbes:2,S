Thanks for debugging.
I think I found the culprit.  This bug happens only on a chip with
multiple playback capability, and when you open OSS devices multiple
times.
Try the patch below.  The change in pcm_native.c may be unnecessary,
but it's better so.
If it works, I'll submit the patches with a proper log.
thanks,
Takashi
