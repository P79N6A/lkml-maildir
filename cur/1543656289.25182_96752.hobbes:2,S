On a slightly more real system call (gettimeofday - which actually matters
in real life) the difference is still visible, but less so - because the
system call itself takes more of the time, and the kernel entry overhead
is thus not as clear.
For gettimeofday(), the results on my P4 are:
	sysenter:	1280.425844 cycles
	int/iret:	2415.698224 cycles
			1135.272380 cycles diff
	factor 1.886637
ie sysenter makes that system call almost twice as fast.
It's not as good as a pure user-mode solution using tsc could be, but
we've seen the kinds of complexities that has with multi-CPU systems, and
they are so painful that I suspect the sysenter approach is a lot more
palatable even if it doesn't allow for the absolute best theoretical
numbers.
