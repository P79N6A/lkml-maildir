Ok, I found the cause of the oops.  Some of radio tuner code was
expecting a struct bttv_fh to be allocated but this wasn't done in
radio_open.  So it would dereference an invalid data structure, causing
a hang for me and an oops for Bongani.  I also had to add support for
the radio tuner to some shared functions.  Patches to follow.
