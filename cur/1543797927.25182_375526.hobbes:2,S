btw., in the -rt tree we rarely had 'silent breakage' - roughly 80% of 
the cases were caught build-time: we eliminated DECLARE_MUTEX_LOCKED, 
which is a clear sign for non-mutex semaphore usage. Another 19% was 
caught by runtime checks: 'does owner unlock the mutex'. The remaining 
1% was breakage that was not found quickly.
