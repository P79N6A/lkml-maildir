I have an i82092AA evaluation board:
00:06.0 PCMCIA bridge: Intel Corporation 82092AA_0 (rev 02)
	Flags: slow devsel, IRQ 27
	I/O ports at 8400 [size=4]
I have three problems:
1. I have to specify the i365_base parameter when loading i82365,o 
2. Even when I specify cs_irq=27, it resorts to polling:
	Intel PCIC probe: 
	  Intel i82365sl DF ISA-to-PCMCIA at port 0x8400 ofs 0x00, 2 sockets
	    host opts [0]: none
	    host opts [1]: none
	    ISA irqs (default) = none! polling interval = 1000 ms
	  Intel i82365sl DF ISA-to-PCMCIA at port 0x8400 ofs 0x80, 2 sockets
	    host opts [2]: none
	    host opts [3]: none
	    ISA irqs (default) = none! polling interval = 1000 ms
3. Note that it finds no IRQs available for the cards' IREQ to use. This is
	on an Alpha SX164. 
I'll fix it over the weekend - basically it just looks like a little too 
much was stripped out of i82365.c when we started handling CardBus bridges 
elsewhere. We ought to still handle PCI->PCMCIA bridges which aren't 
CardBus-capable.
As a separate issue, the IDE on the same chip appears to be confusing the
kernel. I seem to end up with the generic IDE driver driving the on-board
CY82C693, which means I can't do DMA. That may be SRM's fault, though.
