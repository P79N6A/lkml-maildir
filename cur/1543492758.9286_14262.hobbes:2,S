Because you can't notice it. And you are not running some extra opcode per
TCP packet but only per retransmitted TCP packet. At least the solaris
workaround is in a slow path (packet retransmit code) and it can't really
harm performances. About the enlarging of the kernel of some byte (not
kbyte), well if you care about it you should first care about everything
else ;).
