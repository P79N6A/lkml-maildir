Hoo boy, lots of messages this morning.
(Al? I've added you to the CC: because of your swap-in vs swap-out
speed report from January. See below -- half-way down or so -- for
more detals.)

Hmm, I thought drop-behind wasn't going to be able to target metadata?

Yes, and that was the core of my original report months ago. I'm
working for a while on one task, go to openoffice to view a report, or
gimp to tweak the colors on a photo before uploading it, and then go
back to my email and... and... and... there we go. The faults that
occur when I context switch is what's most annoying.

Con wrote a benchmark much like that. It showed measurable improvement
with swap prefetch.

Yeah, akpm and... one of the usual suspects, had mentioned something
such as 2.6 is half the speed of 2.4 for swapin. (Let's see if I can
find a reference for that, it's been a year or more...) Okay,
misremembered. Swap in is half the speed of swap out (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/22/173
 ). Al Boldi (added to the CC:, poor
sod), is the one who knows how to measure that, I'm guessing.
Al? How are you coming up with those figures? I'm interested in
reproducing it. It could be due to something stupid, such as the VM
faulting things out in reverse order or something...

Yeah, I knew I'd get called on that one :-). It's the seeks that'll
really kill you, and as you say once you're on the track the rest is
practically free (which is why the VM should prefer to evict larger
chunks at a time rather than lots of small things, see
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/7/23/214
 for something that's heading the
right direction, though the side-effects are unfortunate.

Fengguang Wu is doing lots of active work on making the readahead suck
less. Ping him and he'll likely take an active interest in the RAID
stuff.
