Exactly.  That is what this patch set is about.  This is the part that 
provides some hooks to extend the traditional reserves to be able to 
handle some of the more difficult situations.

No.  It does no good at all for network to do a bunch of work 
reclaiming, then have some other random task (for example, a heavy 
writer) swoop in and grab the reclaimed memory before net can use it.  
Also, net allocates memory in interrupt context where shrink_caches is 
not possible.  The correct solution is to _reserve_ the memory net 
needs for vm writeout, which is in Peter's next patch set coming down 
the pipe.
