  Subject: ok, vger anoncvs is back, README
  Go have a look at:
  
http://cvs.on.openprojects.net/
  An anoncvs mirror of the vger repositories is available now from
  there.  Sorry for taking so long.  The modules available which people
  should be interested in are 'linux' and 'modutils'.
  Enjoy.
  Later,
