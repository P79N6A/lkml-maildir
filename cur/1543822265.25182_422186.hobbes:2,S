I don't know what interface would be best.  I'm not pushing this big
pile
of junk either.  Unless you find a suitable interface that you include
in
the patchkit we're not gonna add it, even after it's been rewritten to
be
sane.  So if you care to get this in find a suitable interface.
why the hell do you guys expect to get a huge piele of flaky code
integrate
that slows down pagecaches and adds thousands of lines of undebuggable
and
untestable code without submitting something that actually calls it.
I'd love to see the crack that's handed out at your group.
