Hi Andrew,
Here is the kstat cleanup patch set with all the arch changes.
Applies neatly on mm-3.  I am mailing the url since both the patches
exceed 40k limit by  900 bytes  :).  The first patch is for
generic+i386 changes, the second patch is for arch specific changes
for all other archs. Tested well on a PIII 4 way.
Patches can be found at:
http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/lse/kstat-2.5.44-mm3-2.patch
and
http://osdn.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/lse/kstat-arch-2.5.44-mm3.patch
Thanks,
Kiran
