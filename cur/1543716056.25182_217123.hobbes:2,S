Try it - you'll find that the system will leave all of your 200M of mapped
memory in place.  You'll be left with 300M of pagecache from that I/O
activity.  There may be a small amount of unmapping activity if the I/O is
a write, or if the system has a small highmem zone.  Maybe.
Beware that both ARM and NFS seem to be doing odd things, so try it on a
PC+disk first ;)

No, the system will only start to unmap pages if reclaim of unmapped
pagecache is getting into difficulty.  The threshold of "getting into
difficulty" is controlled by /proc/sys/vm/swappiness.

yes, remembering aging info over that period of time is hard.  We only have
six levels of aging: referenced+active, unreferenced+active,
referenced+inactive,unreferenced+inactive, plus position-on-lru*2.

It controls the level of page reclaim distress at which we decide to start
reclaiming mapped pages.
We prefer to reclaim pagecache, but we have to start swapping at *some*
level of reclaim failure.  swappiness sets that level, in rather vague
units.
It might make sense to recast swappiness in terms of
pages_reclaimed/pages_scanned, which is the real metric of page reclaim
distress.  But that would only affect the meaning of the actual number - it
wouldn't change the tunable's effect on the system.
