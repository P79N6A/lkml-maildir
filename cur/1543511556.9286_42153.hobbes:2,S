No.  They were not in "D" state prior to me killing them.
SIGTERM did NOTHING to them, so I SIGKILL'd them, and they went
to D state and stayed.  I viewed the process tree and killed the
parent processes until I regained control of the Virtual console
only after killing the login process itself, and watching init
respawn and wait for 5 minutes, then did some CTRL key wickedness
and fixed the login.  After that, I saw the dead mc process was
inherited by init and was "D".  Several processes piled up like
this, and some "bash" zombies ended up lying around too.
Eventually, I rebooted, and when the system came up, MC worked
excellent once again, and nothing was wrong since.  Very strange.
