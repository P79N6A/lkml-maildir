Sorry if this is a bit OT, but why doesn't ACPI scale the CPU
frequency back instead of shutting down? This is what APM does on my
laptop (presumably in the BIOS) but when I enable ACPI the machine
shuts down whenever I do something CPU intensive (yes; it's a poorly
designed laptop). I have cpufreq support (cpufreq: P4/Xeon(TM) CPU
On-Demand Clock Modulation available). Has this kind of thing been
added since I last tried it, or do I actually have to actively set up
cpufreq in user space to get thermally-induced clock modulation? Or is
not even possible with the current state of things?
