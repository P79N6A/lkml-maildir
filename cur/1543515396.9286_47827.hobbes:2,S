Subject: 2.2.{12,13} lock on shutdown on Abit BP6 SMP Celeron

I have a dual Celeron 466, Abit BP6 board. Starting with 2.2.12, when I
first noticed it, on occaision, shutdown -h now would *immediately* lock
the machine. Hard. No beep, no warning, just lock. It still occurs with
2.2.13, I just saw it a few minutes ago. Immediately after, I had
occaision to shutdown again, and it worked without trouble. I have no clue
as to what is causing this. I heard whisperings of APM problems from
someone, but I don't have APM enabled in the kernel.
What could be causing this? It's very, very annoying ;)
I would run 2.0.x, but the SMP is lackluster :(
Thank you much,
Landon Fuller
