Lukas,
You would need to use the cxgb-2.1.1 driver (NIC only). It is near the bottom of 
the webpage, under "Chelsio N210 / N110 10Gb Ethernet Server Adapter",  Chelsio 
N210 / N110 Linux Driver - Version 2.1.1 (05/17/2005).
<
https://service.chelsio.com/drivers/linux/n210/cxgb-2.1.1.tar.gz>
Use the above driver for the T110 in NIC mode. This driver will work for the 
T110 and T210 but only in NIC mode.
The NIC driver does not have CONFIG_CHELSIO_T1_OFFLOAD, so the card will work in 
  NIC only mode.
You would not have success in trying to modify the TOE driver (cxgbtoe-2.1.1) 
because this requires a lot of modifications to the TOM (TCP Offload Module) and 
the TOE API in order to work with a newer kernel.
In the future, we plan on trying to get our TOE API into the Linux kernel, but 
this requires a lot of work and acceptance of TOE by the community first.
