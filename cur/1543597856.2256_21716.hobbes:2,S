   The SCSI issue was exactly what was on my mind, and is indeed the reason
   why I didn't go all the way and did a complete conversion there. The
   SCSI layer is _not_ very clean in this regard, didn't exactly enjoy this
   part of the work...
   
I just took a quick look at this, and I think I can make this
alt_address thing into a scsi-layer-specific mechanism and
thus be able to safely remove it from struct scatterlist.
Would you like me to whip up such a set of changes?  I'll be
more than happy to work on it.
