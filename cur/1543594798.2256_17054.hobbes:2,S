Compared to E1000s???  You must be talking about some *really* expensive 
engineers!

Depends on where you are in the world.  It's certainly not true here 
(everyone knows C/C++...  Haven't had a java developer apply for a job 
in months).

Depends on the developers.  Good developers can churn out the same 
project to roughly the same timescale in any language (except possibly 
assembly).
Java is useful if you need the cross platform bit & the target users 
aren't technically savvy enough to recompile.  For an in-house app where 
you control the hardware you'd be better off using a C/C++/RAD & doing 
it native.

(Just came back from a .NET conference...  MS are currently rewriting 
all their apps in bytecode... whoopee...  They're even porting *games* 
to run on it.  I can see it now 'MS Flight Simulator .NET' (Requires 
quad Pentium 4 1.6Ghz minimum) :-o )
