??? If the length is 1..5 I suspect you could use the top two bits and fit
the whole thing in a byte. But since bytes work well, use the top three
bits for length without the one bit offset. Still a big win over strings,
although a LOT harder to get right by eye.
I want to see this go to the sound card, so that when the admins are in
the ready room drinking coffee and listening to mp3s over the speakers
they will "get the message." Actually one guys says he can read morse in
his sleep, when he's "studying a manual" head down we might see about
that;-)
