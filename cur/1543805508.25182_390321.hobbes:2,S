As a said issue, I'm running 2.6.15-rc7 and SiL 3114 with 3 drives 
attached on AMD64. I might like to test your patches, but I have small 
issues even without the patch (happens every now and then, but not every 
day):
ata2: no sense translation for status: 0x51
ata2: translated ATA stat/err 0x51/00 to SCSI SK/ASC/ASCQ 0x3/11/04
ata2: status=0x51 { DriveReady SeekComplete Error }
How do I find out which sd disk in the system does that ata2 refer to? I 
have: hda, hdc and sd[abc]. All sd disks are on SiL 3114.
