Yes. Look at partx.

Yes. Look at partx.

You must distinguish the on-disk partition table and the kernel
partition table. You can change the on-disk partition table just by
writing to it, but that does not change the kernel's ideas.
You can change the kernel partition table using the right ioctls
but that does not change the bits on disk.
Usually one does
	blockdev --rereadpt /dev/something
after changing media, or after writing to the partition table,
but that will fail if the disk is busy.
