Thanks for the information. I guess the fix for your case would be then
to use the bootmem allocator for allocating the page table hash.
It should have no problems with very large continuous tables, assuming
you have the (physically continuous) memory.
Another possibility would be to switch to some tree/skiplist, but that's 
probably too radical and may have other problems on smaller boxes.
