Petr, thanks once again for the fixes.  I took the liberty to split your
patch into the read(), write(), and ioctl() parts but kept your From:
and Signed-off-by: and Dan's ACK.  Is this OK with you?  I will reply to
this message with
[PATCH 1/3] ieee1394: raw1394: Fix read() for 32bit userland on 64bit kernel
[PATCH 2/3] ieee1394: raw1394: Fix write() for 32bit userland on 64bit kernel
[PATCH 3/3] ieee1394: raw1394: Add ioctl() for 32bit userland on 64bit kernel
I plan to do some own testing on a x86-64 box on Thursday and will then
pass it upstream ASAP.
