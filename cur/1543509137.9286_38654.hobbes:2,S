Is it possible that your system actually running out of memory or
processes?  -- what are the other stats of the system prior to the crash? 
Also, please explain what you mean by "crashes" -- the term itself is far
too broad.  If there is an Oops, the results of running it through
ksymoops (against the correct System.map et al) will help pinpoint what is
going wrong.  Also, what is the configuration of your hardware?
