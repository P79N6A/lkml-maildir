Because we get to the code of interest when we have no memory on the 
buddy free lists and need to reclaim memory to fill them up again.

It is not necessary because you can reclaim memory as needed.

The idea of adding code to deal with "I have no memory" situations 
in a kernel that based on have as much memory as possible in use at all 
times is plainly the wrong approach. If you need memory then memory needs 
to be reclaimed. That is the basic way that things work and following that 
through brings about a much less invasive solution without all the issues 
that the proposed solution creates.
