This is version 2 of the jdb/2 patches to eliminate code duplication and
gracefully handle cace initialisation failure.
Changes since V1:
 * Check whether caches are initialised in journal_init_common. If not then
   attempt to initialise them once before failing.
 * Addressed all Andreas Dilger's comments.
 * Modified the initialisation/destruction methods to match Christoph Hellwig's
   suggestions.
 * Rolled the if/assertion and debugfs changes into the main patch.
Andrew, please drop the earlier versions of these patches and replace them with
these ones, thanks.
Cheers,
Duane.
