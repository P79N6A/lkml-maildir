Yesterday I sent a patch to add stack-poison so the stack usage
could be observed.
Today I wrote a small program and tested the stack usage. Both
the program and the patch is attached. The result is:
Offset : 2ec8f000	Available Stack bytes = 3104
Offset : 2ecb1000	Available Stack bytes = 3104
Offset : 2ee5f000	Available Stack bytes = 20
Offset : 2f36d000	Available Stack bytes = 3104
Offset : 2fd09000	Available Stack bytes = 3012
Offset : 2fd0b000	Available Stack bytes = 3312
Offset : 2fd0f000	Available Stack bytes = 2132
Offset : 2fd2f000	Available Stack bytes = 2744
Offset : 2fd57000	Available Stack bytes = 2900
Offset : 2fdd5000	Available Stack bytes = 1400
Offset : 2fe35000	Available Stack bytes = 2832
Offset : 2ff3f000	Available Stack bytes = 776
Offset : 2ff45000	Available Stack bytes = 3188
This, after compiling the kernel. I did not have 4k stacks
enabled for this test so any crashing of the stack beyond
one page will not hurt the system. This was on linux-2.6.13.4.
Anyway, I tried to enable 4k stacks and the machine would
not boot past trying to install the first module. It just
stopped with the interrupts disabled. So, I am now rebuilding
the kernel back as I write this. That's why I am using 2.6.13
at the moment.
Anyway, getting down to 20 bytes of stack-space available
seems to be pretty scary.
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
