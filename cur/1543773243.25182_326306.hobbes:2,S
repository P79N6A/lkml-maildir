It's not supposed to be freed in that function.
It is saved for later use at line 288:
	ei->i_block_alloc_info = block_i;
and freed (I think) in fs/ext3/super.c::ext3_clear_inode():
	EXT3_I(inode)->i_block_alloc_info = NULL;
	kfree(rsv);
where rsv is:
	struct ext3_block_alloc_info *rsv = EXT3_I(inode)->i_block_alloc_info;
However, back to fs/ext3/balloc.c::ext3_init_block_alloc_info():
{
	struct ext3_inode_info *ei = EXT3_I(inode);
[1]	struct ext3_block_alloc_info *block_i = ei->i_block_alloc_info;
	struct super_block *sb = inode->i_sb;
[2]	block_i = kmalloc(sizeof(*block_i), GFP_NOFS);
	if (block_i) {
Seems to me that <block_i> [1] is clobbered by [2] and could be a
memory leak unless the value in [1] is always NULL....
