"Hey, the new VM in 2.4.10 should have replicated the swap overload failure 
case in 2.4.9!  The first implementation should definitely melt down exactly 
the same way!  We need to artificially introduce all the flaws in the old 
one, just to prove it can be done!  Otherwise the new code is not 
interesting."
"To get people to try Linux on the desktop, first we need to make it

What the...?
Wouldn't it be nice if there was an implementation of CML2 that did 
everything CML1 did -EXCEPT- for the structural flaws?  Rather than a blind 
mindless drooling bug-for-bug clone that defeats the whole purpose of 
reimplementing the thing?
Your requirement seems to be based on the blind assumption that CML1 had 
nothing whatsoever wrong with it, and CML2 didn't need to be done in the 
first place.  If that's your argument, then say it directly.  (That might be 
a defendable position.  The one you just stated isn't.)
As for breaking CML2 so it's capable of producing a configuration that the 
rulebase says won't compile, the way CML1 can...  You do understand the 
difference between a procedural and a declarative language, right?
