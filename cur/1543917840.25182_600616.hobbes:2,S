MTD is the only code in the tree at the moment that breaks "make 
randconfig" tests (after ~2000 random rebuilds) - and those tests _are_ 
immensely useful, they catch a lot of build breakage in the scheduler 
git tree for example, before i push it out. So if possible it would be 
nice to have this in .23.
