That sounds like a "yes", not a "no" ... except for devices on busses
that don't have do memory mapped I/O.  It's what I described:  dma_*()
calls being used with struct device, without BUGging out.

USB already does that ... you write as if it didn't.  It's done that
since pretty early in the 2.4 series, when conversions to the "new" PCI
DMA APIs replaced usage of virt_to_bus and bus_to_virt and USB became
usable on platforms that weren't very PC-like.  Controllers that don't
use PCI also need Linux support, in embedded configs.
However, the device drivers can't do that using the not-yet-generic DMA
calls.  It's handled by usbcore, or by the USB DMA calls.  That works,
and will continue to do so ... but it does highlight how "generic" the
implementation of those APIs is (not very).
