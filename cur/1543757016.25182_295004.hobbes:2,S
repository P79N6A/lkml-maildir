No, I think we understand the interaction between manual page migration
and cpusets.  We've tried to keep the discussion here disjoint from cpusets
for tactical reasons -- we didn't want to tie acceptance of the manual
page migration code to acceptance of cpusets.
The exact ordering of when a task is moved to a new cpuset and when the
migration occurs doesn't matter, AFAIK, if we accept the notion that
a migrated task is in suspended state until after everything associated
with it (including the new cpuset definition) is done.
