Much of this already had been answered, but just to summarize:
* technically, binary drivers are a very bad idea - just look at 
  the utterly broken nv crap. 
* IMHO, as soon as you include some kernel-internal headers, you've
  got an derived work, thus violating GPL (IANAL!)
* binary-only drivers DON NOT protect IP, just delay the process 
  of revealing a little bit.
* try to find out whether the customer *really* has some valueble 
  IP to protect or if it's just it's default oppionion
* *if* the customer still wants an binary-only driver, you check 
  whether the logic to hide can be moved to userland (let the userland
  part talk to the in-kernel driver via 9P)
* let your customer know that binary-only drivers tend to heavily 
  damage a company's reputation in the OSS world, *BAD* for marketing.
