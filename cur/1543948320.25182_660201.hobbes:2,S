Forgive me the stupid question, but you don't happen to have Wake On
LAN or somesuch enabled in your BIOS, do you? (Given yours stays down
for five seconds then resumes, and other T61 owners aren't seeing that
behavior... <shrug>)
For Pavel and Rafael: Is there some sort of event that gets handed
back on resume to let the kernel know why the system woke up? One
would think that the Wake On LAN (keyboard, timer, etc.) would hand a
notification over to the OS. One is often wrong though.
