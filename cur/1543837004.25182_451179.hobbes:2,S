This is YOU, isnt it!--- 
You get withdrawal symptoms if youre away from your
computer for more than five minutes. Your spouse has
threatened to take an axe to your monitor. You no
longer have time to do the little things  like eat
and sleep.
The WORST part is that for all the time youre
spending at your keyboard--- 
---youre not making a nickel! 
Listen, my friend, I KNOW what youre going through!
Just like you, I gave up friends, family, and going to
the bathroom so I had more time to become the next
Internet millionaire. And yes, just like you, my
profits wouldnt have bought a postage stamp! 
Understand, Im not lazy. I knew that any
business requires an outlay of time. I would not
have minded all the hours I was putting in--- if I were
just making some blasted income! 
Then I found out about what I now call my--- 
---Five Minute Marketing Miracle! 
I found out that there are simple, little tricks and
techniques that anyone can use to--- 
** Reduce your time online from HOURS a day to just
FIVE MINUTES a day! 
** Produce all the hits your need in the time it
takes to eat a baloney sandwich! 
** Start generating INCOME instead of BILLS
- during the commercials of a Seinfeld rerun! 
Stop being a slave to your computer, and let me help
you get your life back, at---

And if something is unclear, please email,
or even CALL me. I might not have ALL the
answers, but I WILL be happy to help in any way I can!
