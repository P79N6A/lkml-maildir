? My patch did handle the ctor case.

Yes, I think that should do it too.  The reason behind my repeating
the block was to handle the case where SLAB_POISON is passed to
kmem_cache_create, but CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG is off.  But apparently
that case would hit the BUG_ON(flags & ~CREATE_MASK), therefore
your patch is simpler and better.  Quite a maze.
