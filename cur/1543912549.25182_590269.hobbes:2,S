So, there's a power outage and the UPS had a glitch.
Oops, you've got to recover multiple TB and tell users everything since 
the last incremental backup is gone.
You use UPS in the computer room but management, in it's cost cutting 
wisdom, hasn't provided for UPS for your Unix workstations and there's a 
power outage. Oops, you've got lots of corrupt files but you don't know 
which ones they are so you've got to recover multiple TB and tell users 
everything since the last incremental backup is gone.
Ok, so hard mounting may not always save you in these circumstances but 
soft mounting will surely get you in the neck.
