You designed a NUMA API to control a process memory access patterns 
without the ability to view or modify the policies in use?
The locking issues for the policy information in the task_struct could be 
solved by having a thread execute a function that either sets or gets the 
memory policy. The vma policies already have a locking mechanism.
This piece here only does conversion to a string representation so it 
should not be affected by locking issues. Processes need to do proper 
locking when using the conversion functions.
