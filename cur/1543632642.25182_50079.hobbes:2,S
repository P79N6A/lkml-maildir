I tried again with the 'nocto' mount option, although I can't be sure that the 
files will not change on the server, but the behaviour didn't change :-(
To get more info about this problem I compared the compile time and the nfs 
traffic between 2.4.18-4 and 2.5.20 on a RedHat 7.3 system.
The sources (mosfet-liquid0.9.5.tar.gz - KDE style) were located on the local 
disc and the libraries were linked over nfs.
The results attached to this mail show the big difference !
I hope you can do anything with it.
Greetings, Matthias.
