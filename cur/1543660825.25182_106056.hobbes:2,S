My root fs is RO. Works wonders. Clients simply CANNOT trash their
/bin, /lib etc ;)

It was not really *that* difficult for me. I used devfs and symlinks.
/etc, /var, /tmp are different directories per client,
/home, /usr are shared. The rest stays on root fs readonly.
ssh to NFS server if you want to modify some files on root fs.
Separate etc/var/tmp files for each client = no concurrent rw access.

File locking over the network is hard to do reliably.
I have no experience with that in NFS, but presume there
can be problems in some situations (statd or portmap
crashed on a client, client hung/disconnected from the net,
etc etc etc...)
Anyway, such corner cases are painful, thank you for
your efforts to nail it down.
