Yes. The only reason I'm not going to commit myself to getting carried away 
with seeking to merge it is that you've clearly stated that you don't want to 
see it merged, and you haven't been overruled by other kernel maintainers 
(with perhaps the occasional exception, sometimes privately). If they came 
along to the party and said "Pavel, get your act together. Suspend2 isn't as 
invasive or ugly as you're making it out to be." (or something similar), I'd 
see some point to working on merging it. If they want to tell me to submit it 
again or prove that's the case, I'm more than willing to hear that. But while 
the only feedback is users saying "I wish it was merged" and Pavel saying 
"Ain't going to happen", what am I meant to do?
Regards,
Nigel
