And I actually do not want to distinguish host and guest sides much.
They are namespaces in the first place.
Parent namespace may have some capabilities to manipulate its child
namespaces, like donate its own device to one of its children.
But it comes secondary to having namespace isolation borders.
In particular, because most cases of cross-namespace interaction lead to
failures of formal security models and inability to migrate
namespaces between computers.

This actually goes in the opposite direction to what I keep in mind.
I want to offload as much as possible of network administration work to
guests.  Delegation of management is one of the motivating factors
behind covering not only sockets but devices, routes, and so on by the
namespace patches.

Migration will work inside the kernel, so it has full access
to whatever state information it needs.
