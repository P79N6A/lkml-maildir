The point of view I describe is that it is an unfortunate historical
accident that the 11 minute mode was added to the kernel.
Better user space solutions exist but are harmed by the kernel 11 minute mode.

I can imagine that there is a temperature dependency.
But compare: (i) kernel 11 minute mode: every 11 minutes the system time
is written to the RTC. (ii) user space 11 minute mode: every 11 minutes
RTC is read out and the pair (system time, RTC) is written to file.
Some time later, for example after a reboot, we want to know the time
but do not have (yet) a good outside reference.
Your solution: it is found in RTC.
My solution: it is found in RTC adjusted by the known offset and drift.
You see, your solution is a zero-th order approximation.
It is perfect when the drift is zero.
My solution is a first order approximation.
It is perfect when the drift is constant.
There are no circumstances where kernel 11 minute mode is better.

I think you can solve linear equations yourself.
It looks like you are arguing that a first order approximation is not perfect
and use that to defend a zeroth order approximation...
