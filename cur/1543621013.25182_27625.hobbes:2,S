I checked the last few days of the kernel list, but did not find this 
problem. (Found the other compile problem (in more ways than one) though.)
Everything seems to compile correctly, but I get the following error message 
on "make modules_install".
depmod: *** Unresolved symbols in 
/lib/modules/2.5.4/kernel/drivers/sound/sound.o
depmod: 	virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map
Something is not right.  Had not seen that message though...
I get the same error if I build modules for PCMCIA drivers for aerotech cards 
and probably more.
Anyone have a quick idea what is wrong?  I can provide more info if this is 
new. (Which i doubt...)
