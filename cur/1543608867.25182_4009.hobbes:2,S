   Here is the patch for TUN/TAP to remove that suboptimality :). 
   So we won't call dev_alloc_name if name is not a template.
This won't work.  The whole purpose of calling dev_alloc_name
is to twofold:
1) Make sure the name string is unique
2) Copy that name into dev->name if it is unique
I'm going to change dev_alloc_name() to allow non-'%' names
instead, that is a better fix.
Franks a lot,
