 Is it possible that asserting the IRQ when the mask is active makes it be
mishandled?

 I believe I recover from the lockup -- it's the mask function that
recovers.  But another one happens at the unmask time, I suppose.

 I'll implement the IRQ unlocker I was thinking first.  The idea is not to
try to prevent the lockup from happening as it might even be impossible
but to make the unlocker trigger after a lockup happens instead.  I should
have an implementation ready soon.
