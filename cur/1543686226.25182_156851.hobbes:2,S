Similar experience here running the game-test (xfree86 4.3.99.10, winex
3.1 and "Baldurs Gate I") on a PII 400 with 128 meg ram. Using
2.6.0-test3-O14.1int + O14.1-O15int.
I would say this is the best _and_ worst scheduler I've tried since Con
had to adopt his work to the new Ingo infrastructure. Slightly
smoother than pure A3 unless you manage to trigger badness. Then you (or
I, at least) get exactly 15 seconds of total freezes, mixed with
different periods of normality. And by freezes, I mean total freezes.
I can switch to an already opened text console, but there
a running "top" is dead and it won't take any keystrokes until the
freeze has gone. The only thing not dead is the "sound repeats" that

To convince yourself of this, note that when DMA refill fails to meet
its deadline you will hear repeats, not skipping, because the DMA
hardware on the sound card has been set up to automatically restart the
DMA each time the buffer expires.  Try running the kernel under kgdb and
breaking to the monitor while sound is playing.
