Chip always needs 32MB range in mmio space. So lspci reports 32MB.
Real memory size depends on installed memory, as one could expect.
If you do not trust matroxfb, just do:
yes | dd of=/dev/fb0 bs=32M count=1; dd if=/dev/fb0 of=tmp bs=32M count=1
and then verify tmp file contents... If you get 16MB of 'yes\n' and
16MB of zeroes or 0xFF, you have really 16MB of memory...
