I doubt it does actually. The problem with pci register driver and scsi is
that the two subsystems are designed with violently conflicting goals. Once
DaveJ or someone does the proposed scsi cleanups it'll become the natural
not the obscenely complicated way to do a scsi driver, as well as sorting out
the pcmcia and cardbus scsi mess, and the card failed/recovered stuff once and
for all.
