Subject: [PATCH] 2.3.1[34]: filemap_nopage faults on ->readpage() failure

Hi,
The current code in filemap_nopage() seems to expect the page to still be
locked after an error, but as we've normally just waited on it, it won't be:
...
page_not_uptodate:
	lock_page(page);
	if (Page_Uptodate(page)) {
		UnlockPage(page);
		goto success;
	}
	error = inode->i_op->readpage(file, page);
	if (!error) {
		wait_on_page(page);
		if (Page_Uptodate(page))
			goto success;
	}
	/*
	 * Umm, take care of errors if the page isn't up-to-date.
	 * Try to re-read it _once_. We do this synchronously,
	 * because there really aren't any performance issues here
	 * and we need to check for errors.
	 */
	if (!PageLocked(page))
		PAGE_BUG(page);
	ClearPageError(page);
...
block_read_full_page() never fails, but I don't know what other
implementations of ->readpage() might be expected to do in an error situation.
The 'obvious' fix seems to be:

Thoughts?
