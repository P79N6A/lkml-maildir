No. Its just "nice to have", and it does not support too many

Aha, so some part of kernel exist that has "absolute right". Ok, now I
can imagine that it can work.

Well, make patch and lets see... That means that 2.8 needs to be your
target. If impact outside of arch is not "total rewrite", you might
have a chance. If it is "total rewrite".... well you just need to be
very clever.
