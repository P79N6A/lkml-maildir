...which is why we want to have a wide discussion of it now, the less to 
have to explain to people ;)
I don't expect this process to start taking effect for a while. Not only 
do we need to come to some level of agreement about it, but we need to 
give people the time to learn about it _without_ rejecting patches in the 
meantime. 
There is no real "flag-day" (and it's certainly not today), although I'm
hoping that by the time I start up 2.7.x we'd have this in place.
