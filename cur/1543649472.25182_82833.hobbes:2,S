In terms of implementation, I think it's way too x86-specific...  some 
of the vsyscall infrastructure can be more generic, making it easier for 
other arches to implement the same functionality.  Also use of TSC isn't 
a terribly good idea...
Overall the idea has existed for a while, and I think it's a good one... 
  gettimeofday(2) is very definitely a performance bottleneck in 
databases, in apache [if nothing's changed in that area...], etc.
