Current processes _may_ abort.  Or, if you're unlucky, they may just go
ahead and do the wrong thing.  This includes ostensibly secure programs,
if you upgrade libc.  So overwrite isn't just very bad, it's very, very
bad.

You forgot (or perhaps it is implied): ld.so should create the new
symbolic links under different names, and rename them to atomically
replace the old links.  I don't know if ld.so does this.
