Yes, that is, I think, the correct thing to do... but see also below.

I think that's the correct behaviour for an automounter, except for stat(),
which I'd prefer _not_ to cause this (so you can "browse").

Looking at my code, I should probably use the semaphore from the namespace
pointed to by the vfsmount I'm going to be mounting on, just in case we've
managed to cross into someone else's namespace:
	int kern_automount(struct vfsmount *on_mnt, struct dentry *on_dentry)
	{
+		struct namespace *namespace = on_mnt->mnt_namespace;
		struct nameidata nd;
	...
-		down_write(&current->namespace->sem);
+		down_write(&namespace->sem);
	...
-		up_write(&current->namespace->sem);
+		up_write(&namespace->sem);
	...
	}

Not exactly unrelated. If namespace A derives from namespace B during clone(),
then I would consider B should behave exactly as A until modified - including
automount facilities.

Well, if you, say, cloned a shell with its own namespace with the intent of 
rearranging its namespace for that user, then I think it would be fair to say
that you'd have to "change things" at some point (ie: use (u)mount to
rearrange the topology).
