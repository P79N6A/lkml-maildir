Hi,
I have a friend who is trying to make a linux gateway onto a network
with one of these cards.  He is masquerading a dual booting machine
through a linux box with two cards:
- a PCI NE2000 clone
- Accton 1207D TX (picked up as SMC 1211 and using the Realtek 8139
driver)
Whenever he scps stuff between the two machines (over the Accton card)
and seemingly whenever there is much network activity, he gets messages
like:
Transmit timeout status 0c 0005 media 08
Tx queue start entry 42320 dirty entry 42316
hda lost interrupt
and sometimes:
RTL8139 interrupt line blocked status 5.
This is with 2.2.14 which has the 1.07 driver.  Trying 1.08 from Donald
Becker's webpage didn't help and got a similar error.
Is this a known problem?  Searching archives I found similar problems
but no real solutions.
Once this happens his computer is effectively dead.  Seeming nothing can
get to the disk.  The messages repeat ad infinitum.
I check /proc/interrupts and there didn't seem to be any obvious
clashes:
           CPU0
  0:     220054          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       7403          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  3:      30135          XT-PIC  serial
  8:          1          XT-PIC  rtc
 10:      86640          XT-PIC  eth0
 11:         71          XT-PIC  eth1
 13:          1          XT-PIC  fpu
 14:     246234          XT-PIC  ide0
NMI:          0
NB eth1 is the RTL 8139 and eth0 is the ne2k-pci
After the problem, cat /proc/interrupts shows that the interrupts for
ide0 are not increasing.
Any ideas?
Simon.
