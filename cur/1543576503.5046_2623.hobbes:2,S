I have ide.2.2.18.1209.patch applied. The kernel is 2.2.18.
So what is the answer? 4 controllers max or 10 for my kernel?

I have done this. There are no conflicts.
SB32 uses 0x168-0x16f,0x36e,10 and nothing else does.
What would be the correct kernel command to manually set up the SB32 as ide
4 for the above resources?
Kernel 2.4.0-test12 picks up the SB32 controller even with the promise
controller is installed, but I would prefer to stay with the stable 2.2.x
kernel if possible.
