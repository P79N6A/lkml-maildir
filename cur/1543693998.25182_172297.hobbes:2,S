relayfs isn't trying to provide a generic queueing model - it's
basically just an efficient buffering mechanism with hooks for
kernel-user data transfer.  It's a lower-level thing than netlink and
might even be of use to netlink as a buffering layer.
In any case, applications like tracing or kernel debugging don't have
a need for more of a queueing model than the in-order delivery and
event buffering capabilities relayfs provides, and since applications
like these either can't use netlink or would benefit from the
efficiency provided by a no-frills buffering scheme, maybe there
is actually a use for something like relayfs.
