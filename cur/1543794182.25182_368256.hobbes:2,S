Or you could - more cleanly - do a replace through all your source
files (with an editor or a tool) which replaces printf with log (or
something similar) and implement that function with the code to write
to the log file and to stdout.

Now, a requirement came up which needs all those messages thrown to STDOUT also to be logged in a LOGFILE (in addition to STDOUT). Yes, this can be done through tee...but the usage model of the compiler doesn't leave that possibility open for me.
