An interesting remark Andi, especially in the light of your note to me
regarding your use of DProbes - i.e. you'd rather use DProbes to dump out
some info from the kernel than recompile it with printks.
I don't have an aversion to recompiling the kernel - it's great fun - I
love watching all the meeages go by, waiting with bated breath for a
compile error, which never seems to happen. Just like watching the National
Lottery, waiting for your own numbers to come up.
To be a little more serious, it's not recompilation that's a problem, its
re-working a set of (non-standard) patches together. I'm not that excited
by that - I'd rather develop new code than rework old. Anyway for a couple
of  example scenarios see the response I made to Michael Rothwell.  And by
the way, I absolutely agree with your approach to kernel problem solving -
but wouldn't it be a help if you didn't have to put a large or even
moderate effort into working the DProbes patch into some hot-off-the-press
version of the kernel?
