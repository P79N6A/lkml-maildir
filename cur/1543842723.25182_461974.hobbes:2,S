That's not the point. The question is what glibc's _implementation_ uses
for doing the ioctls. It has to have _some_ definition of the kernel's
version of the structure.
In fact it seems to have its own 'kernel_termios.h' which is an old copy
of our headers. So in that case, we really can drop <asm/termios.h> from
the export -- as least as far as glibc is concerned. I'm not sure about
other C libraries.
On the other hand, the kind of change you're making is an example of why
we might want glibc to be using a _sanely_ exported copy of our headers
directly, rather than an out-of-date version of its own. But that's a
policy decision I'll leave to you. 
If you want to declare that asm/termios.h isn't to be exported even for
glibc builds then please drop all __KERNEL__ from it and remove it from
include/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm so that it isn't exported.
