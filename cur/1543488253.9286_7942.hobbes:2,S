I disagree.  It's fast, portable, has no overhead for the common case.
Looks like a perfect system to me :)

What makes you think that some form of "configuration management system"
is better than asking this list?

Sometime between 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.  If you're not prepared to hack around
to find and fix the problem, you probably shouldn't be aware of

I have to argue here - code repositories with full revision histories make
the issue of "kernel versions" somewhere between vague and irrelevant.

Of course there's a process for backing out the changes:
$ gunzip patch-2.2.2.gz
$ vim patch-2.2.2
/^diff.*filter
v/^diff
k$dZZ
is a hell of a lot easier than learning how to work this month's
favourite code repository.

Because developer time is more important than user time?  Some people
like CVS, Linus has said that he would look at Bitkeeper.  Not that my
opinion matters, but I like "cp -a" and "diff" to track my hacks.

Perhaps Linux 2.2 isn't for you yet if you're not prepared to put in
some effort to run it.
