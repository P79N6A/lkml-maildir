Subject: [ANNOUNCE] Guilt v0.24
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Sorry for the delayed announcement...
Guilt v0.24 is available for download.
Guilt (Git Quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a Mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.
Tarballs:
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/jsipek/guilt/
Git repo:
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jsipek/guilt.git
The major changes are in status and fork commands. guilt-status now accepts
a number of flags to display only certain subset of changed files (e.g.,
only newly added files). guilt-fork is now smarter about the naming of
patches - following quilt's lead.
Additionally, Brandon Philips, went a head, and create a Debian package for
Guilt. So, if you are a Debian Unstable user, you can Guilt through apt.
As always, patches, and other feedback is welcome.
Josef "Jeff" Sipek.
