I'd like to put it another way:
 - if your mission to another star *depends* on every single piece of 
   complex equipment staying up with zero reboots for 200+ years, you have 
   some serious technology problems.
In other words: your argument is populist, and totally silly.
Trust me, if you are going to another star, you'd better have the 
capabilities to handle bugs. You'd better have multiple fail-over etc.
A notion of "robustness" cannot and must not hinge on "no bugs". That's 
unrealistic.

There's something of a difference between 45 days and 292 years.
I'm not saying we can't get there, but worrying about it in the current 
state is just stupid. It's not just looking at the trees and not seeing 
the forest, it's looking at one *leaf*, and missing the forest.
And quite frankly, if you work for NASA and are aiming for the stars, 
you'd better not be that person who looks at one leaf and cannot see the 
forest around you. That's the kind of thing that makes you miss the 
difference between miles and kilometers.
