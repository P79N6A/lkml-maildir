ok, 4 bits not just 2...  
Be frugal with the patches and don't take just *anything* that looks like a
good fix.  What you want is a more stable version, meaning less changes as
time goes forward.  I know it's the first couple days, but it looks like it
could easily go the other way...  
Anyway, I hope this helps.
