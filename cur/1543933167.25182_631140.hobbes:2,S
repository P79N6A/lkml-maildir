Hello,
My name is Elena, I have 31 years and I live in province of Russia.
I have a 6-years daughter, her father abandoned us and we live with my mother. Recently my mother lost job due to old age and our situation became very difficult.
During the last months the prices for gas and electricity became very high in our region and we cannot use it to heat our home anymore.
The winter becomes colder each day, we very afraid and we don't know what to do.
The only accessible way for us heat our home is to use portable stove which give heat with burning wood. We have a lot wood in our region and this stove will heat our home all winter for minimal charges. 
I work in library and after my job I allowed to use computer. I finded your address in internet and may be you can help us.
We need portable wood burning stove, but we cannot buy it in our local market because it is expensive for us. May be you have any portable stove which you dont use anymore, we will be very grateful to you if you can donate its to us and organize transport of its to our address. This stoves are different, and they weight between 70-150kg.
I downloaded picture of me and my daughter to web-site and you can see it here:

It is not very good quality, but it will show you how we look like.
I hope that you write me back.
Elena. 
Russia.
