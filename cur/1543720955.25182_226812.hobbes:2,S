Can I be so bold as to ask about the changed to the timer list code?  Assuming 
we scrapped all the ifdefs, that is.
I have been thinking of a major rewrite which would leave this code alone, but 
would introduce an additional list and, of course, overhead for high-res timers. 
  This will take some time and be sub optimal, so I wonder if it is needed.
