Ingo,
These two patches are fixes. The first cleans up the stack_trace
output to print 0's for the return_to_handler function.
The second is the nasty race we have been hitting. My patches must
have made the race window bigger for you since the bug was there
before. It is a nasty race in the fork code. More info in the change log
of that patch.
The following patches are in:
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/rostedt/linux-2.6-trace.git
    branch: tip/devel
Steven Rostedt (2):
      trace: fix output of stack trace
      ftrace: fix race in function graph during fork
