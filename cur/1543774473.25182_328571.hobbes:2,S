It is more complex this way. You need to do additional parsing...

Actually, I think that both should be in device's directory. When unbinding
a device you normally don't care what driver it is bound to, you just want
to make sure that there is no driver bound to the device afterwards. I.e it
is a operation on device. When binding you could argue both ways, but then
again you usually have a piece of hardware you want to assign specific driver
for, so I'd say it is operation on device as well.
Also, some buses may implement other similar operatons, like rescan and
reconnect (serio/gameport buses). They are similar to "bind" except that
you do not specify driver at all. If bind/unbind is in the driver and
connect/reconnect are in the device's directory it will be complete mess.
