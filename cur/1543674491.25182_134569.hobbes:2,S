That's right, though the driver is not exhibiting a R/W /proc interface,
which probably means I'll have to reboot the server.
However, what I'm trying to figure out is : why did this latency 
change suddenly, if it can't be related to a CPU Cycle Saver, as
the code doesn't seem to contain something that would allow a dynamic
change of such a parameter on a running machine...
Of course, the problem may be completely unrelated to the NIC,
my initial question being : is there a CPU Cycle Saver on the e1000
as there is one on the e100... ;-)
Regards,
Paul
