Note that this will have to touch the FS anyway, since the O_CREAT thing
forces a call down to the FS to actually create the file.
The only think we save is a dentry kfree/kmalloc in this case, nbot a FS
downcall. And I think Andrea is right that it can waste memory for the
likely much more common case where the file just stays removed.
