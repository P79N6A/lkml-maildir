Yep.

Indeed, unless there is a potention performance impact.

Probably not, unless it needed them because the code was obscure.  If
/what/ the functions do is documented and /how/ they do it is obvious,
additional comments should only be necessary when non-obvious or tricky
things are happening.
The theory is that kernel hackers don't need to be told:
	int i; /* this is used as a loop counter further on */
when
	int i;
is enough.

Safety is better.  A common pattern is something like this:
useful_func(..)
{
	lock_something(&something_lock);
	...
	unlock_something(&something_lock);
}
which gets turned into:
useful_func(..)
{
	lock_something(&something_lock);
	__useful_func(..);
	unlock_something(&something_lock);
}
and __useful_func(..) does the rest of the work.  That way you
can be more flexible about what you have to lock for, &c.

You'd have to ask the man himself about this.

If the feature and code are self-contained, add more than a couple of k to
the kernel or have potential performance implications, and are not useful
for everyone, then it should probably be optional, IMO.
