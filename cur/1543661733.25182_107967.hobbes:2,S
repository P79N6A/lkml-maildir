I removed the other Mike Anderson (mikeand@us.ibm.com) from the cc
list, we seem to have many Mike Anderson's around hear :-).

I have been buried lately so I have only taken the patch you sent me
and updated it so it will compile with the most recent SCSI
changes. I also made a few tweaks to the make files.
Currently it is running on my 2202 card system.
When I ran it my other system that has a Qlogic ISP1020 and two Qlogic
2300's it would hang post initing the driver. The driver seemed to be
responsive to external events like port downs, but appeared to not
complete its init. When I use the driver disable defines to turn off
detection of the ISP1020 the driver loaded ok (I only ran it up to 60MB
on a few spindles so not a very good test).
I will look at this more and see if I can understand the cause.
