the compiler cannot discard the multiplication and the division from the
following:
	x * 1000 / 1000
due to overflows. But we know that HZ is 1000 in the arch-dependent
param.h, and in sched.c we use the HZ dependent variant:
 #ifndef JIFFIES_TO_MSEC
 # define JIFFIES_TO_MSEC(x) ((x) * 1000 / HZ)
 #endif
 #ifndef MSEC_TO_JIFFIES
 # define MSEC_TO_JIFFIES(x) ((x) * HZ / 1000)
 #endif
