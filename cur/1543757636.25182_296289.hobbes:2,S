Hi all,
I'm suffering from destination cache overflow on router running kernel 
2.6.10. This wouldn't be anything special if not different numbers 
reported by slabinfo and the real state. It's worth to mention that 
there was no problems with old 2.4.x here.
user@somemachine:~$ cat /proc/slabinfo | grep ip_dst_cache; \
 > cat /proc/net/rt_cache | wc -l; \
 > /sbin/ip ro sh cache | grep cache | wc -l;
ip_dst_cache      153870 154530    256   15    1 : tunables  120   60 
  8 : slabdata  10302  10302      0

I'm increasing /proc/sys/net/ipv4/route/max_size, but the value reported 
by slabinfo also slowly but steady is going up.
There is similar issue here (maybe even more), 
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/net/0312.3/0000.html,
 but 
unfortunatelly stayed without answer.
Please give some hints about that, or if I'm wrong (meaning that is not 
a bug), tell me what to do - I don't want to reboot this router every 
week and CC: me (I'm not subscribed to the list).
I'm also wondering if tuning of rhash_entries= boot parameter could help?
Thank you,
Piotr Kowalczyk
ps.
Output of rtstat, in case it would help:
