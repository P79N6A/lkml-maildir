Hello Michael
When was the last time you checked standards ? Please read them again, and 
stop disinforming people.
http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908775/xsh/write.html
	"On a file not capable of seeking, writing always takes place starting at the
	 current position. The value of a file offset associated with such a device
	is undefined."
A pipe/FIFO is not capable of seeking.
I let you make the conclusion of these two points.
A conformant kernel is free to not touch f_pos for non capable seeking files 
(pipes, sockets, ...), or to put any value in it.
Current code does that not because of lazy programmers, but because its 
generic, and adding special cases (tests + conditional branches) just slow 
down the code and make it larger.

Don't assume your app is sane while the kernel is not. It's not very fair :
Show us the source code so that we can agree with you or disagree.
Also, I've seen some Unixes (namely AIX IBM) that could return a partial write 
even on a regular file on regular file system. An easy way to trigger this 
was to launch a debugger/syscall_tracer on the live process while it was 
doing a big write(). Most 'sane apps' were ignoring the partial return or 
just throw an exception.
Even on 'cleaner Unixes', a write() near the ulimit -f may return a partial 
count on a regular file.

Before saying current linux code is "blatantly stupid and easily avoided", 
just post your patches so that we can check them and eventually say : 
Oh yes, Michael was right and {we|they} were "stupid" all these years
Thank you
