Hi,
Someone introduced, by Linus' request I remember, pfn_valid() instead of 
PAGE_INVALID() and such. Now I try to compile on Sparc, and /mm/memory.c 
is the first file which hits missing macros: pte_pfn, pfn_valid, 
pfn_to_page nd pfn_pte. I grepped for some declaration and hit only the 
two in the two-/three-level pagetable of i386. The only other occurrences 
of pte_pfn in *.[ch] were uses, not declarations. Global grep returned 
only two more occurrences in the Changeset.
 - pfn_to_page(pfn) is declared as (mem_map + (pfn)) for i386. Can this 
   apply to Sparc64 as well?
 - pte_pfn(x) is declared as
   ((unsigned long)(((x).pte_low >> PAGE_SHIFT)))
   in 2-level pgtable,
   (((x).pte_low >> PAGE_SHIFT) | ((x).pte_high << (32 - PAGE_SHIFT)))
   in 3-level. I suppose 2-level shouldn't exactly match here, how far 
   must the 3-level version be changed in order to fit sparc64? A lot?
 - pfn_valid(pfn) is described as ((pfn) < max_mapnr). Suppose this is OK 
   on Sparc64 either?
 - pfn_pte(page,prot) is defined as
   __pte(((pfn) << PAGE_SHIFT) | pgprot_val(prot))
   How far does this go for Sparc64?
The compile error was:
