if the date is old it's not a problem, I mean, it's ok if they're not
ordered by date of creation of the code. But it would make lots of sense
if the "past" could remain intact.
The problem is if a new changesets can appear in the past, rather than
being always added at the head (no matter the date). If they appear in
the past they can modify every single changeset diff from that point in
the past to the head.
