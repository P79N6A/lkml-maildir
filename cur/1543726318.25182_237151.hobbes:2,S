And the proposal only removes one of the three copies, so you're
probably looking at around a 30% rather than a 50% reduction in the
10%.  Plus whatever knock on effects there might be from different
cache usage.
Is it worth the effort, and added complexity?  Unless there's some
other architecture where the memcpys are really expensive, the answer
at present appears to be, no.
