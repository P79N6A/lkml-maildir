I run lots of well-known benchmarks and volanoMark is the one who gets the largest
impact from sched_yield.
As for real-applications which use sched_yield, mostly, they are not open sources.
Yesterday, I got to know someone was using sched_yield in his network C programs,
but he didn't want to share the sources with me.

That's indeed what I am thinking.
I am running many testing(SPECjbb/SPECjbb2005/cpu2000/iozone/dbench/tbench...) to 
see if there is any regression if sched_compat_yield=1. I think there is no
regression and the testing is just to double-check.
