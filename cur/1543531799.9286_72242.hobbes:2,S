        Since the latest kernels don't have a 'nocheck' option
    for the ext2fs, mounting filesytems with that option specified
    in /etc/fstab fails (I found out when I booted a pre-x kernel
    and saw /usr, /opt, /home, and a few other filesystems failed
    to mount).  Would it be possible to filter out that option
    before trying to pass it on to the kernel?
Of course mount could ask for the kernel version and have
built-in knowledge about which versions will reject it.
Or mount could try a second time without nocheck when
the mount fails (just like it today tries a second time
when mounting a CDROM rw fails).
But I would much prefer the kernel to continue accepting
this nocheck option and ignore it. When 2.4 comes out
many people will have this problem.
Ted, do you agree?
