0 [Unknown        ]: EMU10K1 - SB Live [Unknown]
                     SB Live [Unknown] (rev.6, serial:0x80271102) at 0x8800, irq 5
With the bk-alsa patch reverted, it looks like:
0 [Live           ]: EMU10K1 - Sound Blaster Live!
                     Sound Blaster Live! (rev.6, serial:0x80271102) at 0x8800, irq 5
Hope that helps. If you need any additional information, just ask.
Thanks,
