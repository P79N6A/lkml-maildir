I was thinking more of a driver change that is being triggered on
that particular hardware. FWIW, did you test 2.6.19?
I really need a better idea of the workload these servers are running
and, ideally, a reproducable test case to track something like
this down. At the moment I have no idea what is going on and no
real information on which to even base a guess.
Were there any other messages in the log?

You could try turning it off. If it does fix the problem, then I'd be
pointing once again at hardware ;)
Cheers,
