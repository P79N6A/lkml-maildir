Look, I'm NOT a kernel hacker. I have helluva lot of another work and I can
NOT spend all of my time struggling with omissions and miscellaneous typos
in kernel sources which should have not been there if somebody did try to
compile the kernel before releasing. I'm a distribution maker and I have
much more urgent things to do. Yes, I do want to have some 2.3.xx which does
boot and which I can use as a base for a distro's beta. And I'm ready to
help in reaching this goal doing my best.
But it's not me, who is the kernel writer...

I'd like to. But unfortunately I do NOT have enough time to do exclusively
kernel hacking and debugging. Yes, I can try some options, trace an oops
etc., but I will NOT spend all of my time trying to solve misteries kinda
"Why does the thing not boot at all?"... And I can't reboot my machine
umpting times a day for nothing. Especially considering the fact that often
encountered full fsck (we don't have journalling FS in kernel yet, do we?)
on 36 Gbyte disks takes almost an hour...
