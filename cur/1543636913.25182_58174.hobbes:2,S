2.5 is uptodate wrt the current ext3-for-2.4 development tree.
That means that it's more uptodate than 2.4 is...
Some recent changes to ext3 have exposed a data=journal bug
in 2.5 which is also present in 2.4, but is much harder to hit
there.  I'm not sure what Stephen's intentions are on a 2.4
upgrade, but I'd be inclined to sit tight until 2.4.20-pre.
