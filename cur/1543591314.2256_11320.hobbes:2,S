But you cannot disable shmem.o totally. That's my whole point in the
discussion. Why add something what is mostly included in the kernel
already?
You have to compare shmem with tmpfs against shmem w/o it:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
   3398     376       0    3774     ebe fs/ramfs/ramfs.o
   5150     484       0    5634    1602 mm/shmem.o
   9174     636       0    9810    2652 mm/shmem.o+tmpfs
So tmpfs is 400 Bytes bigger than ramfs. 
If you add the correct timestamp handling the difference will go down
further. And we gain functionality, don't we?
