Subject: 2.6: fs/coda/dir.c: coda_hasmknod seems to be buggy

Function coda_mknod in fs/coda/dir.c (I checked 2.6.10-mm2) stats with:
<--  snip  -->
...
static int coda_mknod(struct inode *dir, struct dentry *de, int mode, dev_t rdev)
{
        int error=0;
        const char *name=de->d_name.name;
        int length=de->d_name.len;
        struct inode *inode;
        struct CodaFid newfid;
        struct coda_vattr attrs;
        if ( coda_hasmknod == 0 )
                return -EIO;
<more code>
...
<--  snip  -->
The problem is that not a single place in the kernel assigns any value 
to coda_hasmknod.
