Hi,
  Could I please be CC'd replies.
  To keep it short and sweet, I have a 45Gb IBM drive that
is slowly dying by getting more bad sectors. I have already
returned my first one to get the current disk, so would like
to use the current one for a while before returning it for 
another disk that will prolly just start dying again.
I am using reiserfs at the moment, which doesn't really like 
to work on a dying drive. for example, doing a make fails to
work even though it is *creating* files on the disk, it fails
to do so because it hits new bad sectors and doesn't seem to
remap them. 
I am wondering what advise on filesystem choice the list as
and any other options I can use to get the kernel to remap
bad blocks.
Thanks.
