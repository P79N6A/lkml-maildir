Multiple source repositories means no-source-control, IMO.

So this means that most of programmers are probably idiots, given the
number of projects that use a _single_ source controlled repository. :)

What other people?
You can only allow trusted people to commit, and backing out crap is quite
easy.
The only risk, in my opinion, of using a source-control system is that it
allows easy forking, that is often a bad idea for the long run. On all
other points, it is better, IMO, to use a source-control system with a
unique repository, than penguinish :) manual patching.
