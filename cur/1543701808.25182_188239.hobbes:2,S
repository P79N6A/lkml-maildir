We disagree, see below.

But may lead to errors in maintenence. Your first example below avoids 
that problem. Imagine instead of "d" you have a 40-50 character RHS. Now 
imagine that the code needs to be changed. If you have the long 
expression in two places then it invites the possiblility of someone 
changing only one of them. You may never make mistakes, but the rest of 
us do, and the conditional LHS avoids that.

You pointed out that this generates good code, I pointed out that it 
also avoids future errors and is not just a trick for broken compilers. 
I take your point about generating good code, I'm sorry you can't see 
that avoiding code duplication is good practice even without the benefit 
of better code.
