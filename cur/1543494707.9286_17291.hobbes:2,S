And "here" is where this happens. 
Wouldn't it be better to just do "return NULL"?
There you have a perfectly valid pointer to access the 0 bytes that
you asked for.
Just like "malloc (0)" returns NULL on some systems: You're toast when
you dare dereference the pointer (beyond what you asked for). (and feel
free not to free/munmap it afterwards.)
The "files" in /proc should in my opinion not pretend to be files:
they should be "pipes". Many programs stat their input file, and if
they get "normal file", they have all sorts of assumptions on tricks
they can do. 
For example, "wc -c" will just return the st_size of the file, instead
of doing all the work that is normally involved in counting the file.
