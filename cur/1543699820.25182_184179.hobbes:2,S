If it were up to me, I will give away full specs and test platforms. But 
it is not...

I will. It take some time, I did not installed 2.6 yet.

Yes. Default is autodetect. Command line is to suppress autodetection.

I thought this way also. But I found that it is not. You may know 
several chipsets,
and do per-chipset stuff, but there is no generic procedure. At least 
authors of PCI-E
don't know (it is nice to have access to the authors ;-) ).
