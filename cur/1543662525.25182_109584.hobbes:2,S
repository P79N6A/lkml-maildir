No, here is where you show *your* ignorance of kernel locking idioms,
and that your axiom is that "the new system is more complex".
I suggest you read the kernel locking guide: it's in the kernel
sources in Documentation/DocBook/kernel-locking.*, try "make psdocs".

This isn't even a sensible question: "This is not a module problem.
How does module locking help?"
You're wasting your own valuable time, too.
