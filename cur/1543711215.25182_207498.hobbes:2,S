I dunno where you get those crazy ideas, REQ_SPECIAL has absolutely
nothing to do with that.

You may use REQ_SPECIAL bit as you see fit, and ->special as well. You
don't have to use them together, must do though. However, as I said
earlier, if you push these requests on to someone else request queue,
you must not fiddle with REQ_SPECIAL and/or ->special. In that case you
cannot touch/use more than what the block layer already does.

That's where to put it, indeed. But if you pass it on...

Sounds like you are acting as a middle man, hence an io stack. And the
place to do the stacking is at make_request_fn time, not at request_fn
time. If you happen to get it working, it'll be fragile at best.

SPECIAL isn't a request type, it's not anything actually (it's to use
for the driver for whatever he wants it to mean). But typically drivers
us it to indicate that they have attached a driver_rq structure to
->special.
