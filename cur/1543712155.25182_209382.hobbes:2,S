OK, tried it and it does not help there. Also loding ACPI processor and
thermal zone compiled in hangs the machine, but loading them as modules
work. The power button still turns off the machine immedieately too with
ACPI on.
So you still need to have both uchi and echi compiled. Ehci is needed for
the hotplug to work properly at least on gentoo.
