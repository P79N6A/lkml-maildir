This is great news!
As a long time user of KDE's kio-slaves, I was always missing the
kio-slave functionality on the command line and in non-kde programs.
FUSE provides a kio-slave interface, but hopefully the inclusion of
FUSE in the mm-kernel  will cause more "fuse native" filesystems to
come out which provide the functionality of the various kio-slaves.
Some things I'd like to see (as I am currently using the KIO
equivalent) implemented as FUSE fs:
- "fish", virtual file access over ssh
- "audiocd", virtual audio cd filesystem which copies and encodes
audio tracks on the fly
- "ftp", virtual file system ftp server access
etc..
Imagination is the limit, and since it can be implemented in userspace
pretty easily with FUSE, I am looking forward to see what people can
come up with and hope that FUSE is here to sray.
Cheers,
   Andre
