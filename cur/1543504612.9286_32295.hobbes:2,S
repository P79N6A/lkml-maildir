  it is the interrupts and the timing... a kernel bug in general
not SMP specific..

I figured there was a problem there too.. so I sent email to X
but never heard a word from them...

this is what I have found out too...

well it is actually sounding like an interrupt/timing problem,
and seems to affect any heavily used interrupt, but not in the
same way. Probably because each interrupt is used differently by
different devices they all react in a different manor.

via the patch that you did? did you post this somewhere outside
of this list?

I found one with X and the xfs..

I am guessing that you are including the BIOS as one of the
buggiest parts of a MB

I figured this was the case.. however I think that they may see
other problems possible that may be caused by timeing..

my guess would be because timing is more important in an SMP
machine, especially where interrupts are distibuted and heavily
used. 
I am not an interrupt or kernel guru, but here are some guesses
/ questions
1) Don't interrupts rely on timing? So if the timing is off or
thrown in a warp, don't the interrupts get thrown off too? (yes
/ no)
2) If the clock jumps forward and then jumps back how does this
affect the CPU's? Maybe they are loosing the interrupt during
the warp, or missing interrupts? (my guess is missing)
** maybe the interrupt is not delievered? 
3) If the CPU looses track of an interrupt in a none SMP kernel
there is only one CPU that has to recover that interrupt,
however if there are two CPU's, maybe the interrupt is not
recovered correctly?
