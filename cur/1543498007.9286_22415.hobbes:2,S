Hi,
Does anybody have/know of a test suite for Linux socket and
signals-related system calls? I'm working on user space emulation and
I need a way of testing that I got the semantics right. There are way
too many calls, options, etc, so developing a comprehensive suite
would be a major pain... (I thought somebody on this list needs a
similar thing to test new patches.)
Thanks a lot,
Borislav
