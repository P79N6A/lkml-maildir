Sorry for the lack of details. I just thought the test-case wouldn't make
sense to you much and didn't paste it in. I was in a bit of a hurry too.
Now I have a little more time and can tell you what is going on:
top_waiter!=NULL
waiter!=NULL
waiter!=rt_mutex_top_waiter(lock)
Therefore one top_waiter is removed and but nothing is inserted.
Below is a fix.
