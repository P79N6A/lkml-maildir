Subject: [PATCH] Document I_SYNC and I_DATASYNC
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/11/15/540

After some archeology (see 
http://logfs.org/logfs/inode_state_bits
) I
finally figured out what the three I_DIRTY bits do.  Maybe others would
prefer less effort to reach this insight.
