 If you are using some Compaq MP compliant machines you will need to set
 the operating system in the BIOS settings to "Unixware" - don't ask me
 why Compaqs don't work otherwise.

+===============================================================================

+How to know SMP is running properly:
+
+You can cat /proc/cpuinfo for instance.That will display each processor with all its properties.
+
+processor	:0
+vendor_id 
+....
+processor	:1
+....
+
+For a simple status you can also cat /proc/stat where first entries display
+cpu statistics.First line titled 'cpu' is a grand total.'cpu0' 'cpu1' processor units.
