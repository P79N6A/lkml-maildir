I use simply __initcall, which is the same level as the
module_initcall used in the crypto functions (sha1.c). Looking into
init.h, security_initcall should resolve to __initcall as well.
Changing the compile sequence orders, the crypto init and sha1
registration happens just ahead of my security module because
(so I assume) the order of the compilation determines the order
of the init calls inside the same initcall block.
Going later and using late_initcall, I seemed to sometimes loose
the mapping of the "nash" executed from the initrd.
