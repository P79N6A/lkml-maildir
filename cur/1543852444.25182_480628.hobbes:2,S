I'd like to keep 250 for a simple reason : the period is an integer
number of milliseconds. I find it very convenient to be able to convert
jiffies to ms. It serves at several places, for instance, poll(). In
fact, what I like with 250 is that there is no divide between ms and
jiffies, but just a bit shift.
