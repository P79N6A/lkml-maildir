Not really.  The point of this patch is to bring the sys_sysctl discussion
to a conclusion.  Either we don't support it and no one uses it.  Or
someone actually uses it so we need to support it.  The stupid case in
glibc where it tests for an SMP kernel when it should be using uname
and has a fallback into /proc/sys doesn't count.

why haven't I gotten it normally yet.
