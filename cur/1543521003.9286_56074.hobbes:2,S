You have two choices.
1. Buy better hardware, as our Lord and Master told us a galaxy
   away and long, long ago... (ouch)
2. Use __get_free_pages() for a range of pages. This will fail
   eventualy when the memory gets more and more fragmented.
3. Use bigphysarea (

)
   (it lacks documentation, on purpose; since that leaves time to
   perfect the program :)

the zr36120 framegrabber has the same problem. Fixed by
doing getfreepages of bigphysarea if that's compiled in.
It does user mapping too (look at zoran_mmap)

Good luck :)
