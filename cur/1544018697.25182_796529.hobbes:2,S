I just want to throw my .02 SEK in here.
In essence, I agree with both of you. :)
We should do what we can to force vendors to follow standards. But as
Wolfgang says, punishing their users rarely gets the job done.
Especially when the user has no idea that the card is to blame.
My general approach in these conditions is to work around the bugs as
much as possible (as long as those workarounds doesn't make life
difficult for compliant cards), and try to shame the vendor by logging
buggy cards.
So Wolfgang, if you could separate out your workarounds to independent
patches and see what can be done to complain in dmesg about hardware
bugs (without flooding dmesg).
