EM wants to determine page_mapcount() for the most part for the
purposes of determining "uniquely attributable RSS" (my ca. 2004
nomenclature) or "proportional RSS" (mpm's more recent nomenclature);
as things now stand it will have to infer them by maintaining a table
of pfn's and mappings thereof, but at least that can be done with it.
