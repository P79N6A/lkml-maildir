I'm not sure:
1) what happens if the cpu runs with disabled local interrupts, the
local apic accepts multiple interrupts. The cpu reenables the local
interrupts. 
Now the tlb flush interrupts should be handled first.
2) we are in the middle of a level triggered interrupt.
We do not ack the interrupt until the end of the interrupt handler. And
the APIC will deliver higher priority interrupts immediately, but lower
priority interrupts wait for the EOI.

The task priority remains 0, but the local apic maintains a "Processor
priority register", and this one changes automagically.
