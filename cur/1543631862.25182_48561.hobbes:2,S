This is just a short notice so that you know I'm working on it.
I did some testing last evening, but I need to do some more
comprehensive ones before any meaningful conclusion.
1 test: compiled ext2 in, mounted partitions as ext2, tests passed
        (no corruption)
2 test: rebooted, mounted as ext3(journal/writeback). This time even
        ext3 passed tests, so I got confused :)
3 test: pushed things harder on ext3, machine started swapping,
        restarted tests and finally it choked (some kind of smon
        non-fatal error 1/100, problem with writing scn, and instance
        shutdown)
Obviously I need to perform tests on ext2 with swap load, and repeat
them few times. Will do this evening (it takes some time to recover a
database after a corruption, so it's slightly time consuming).
Later,
