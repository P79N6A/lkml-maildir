As a side-note: This is from Johan Swenker as a contribution to an 
NTP FAQ; have you considered it?

Question
Every once in a while my system looses 30 msec. How comes?
Answer
You are running Linux; you are using automatic module loading using
/sbin/kerneld. During module loading the kernel does not take good
care of the time. If you can spare the memory, please load the
modules at boot time.
Remark to the editor
This once occured to me. The sound system was demand loaded. A small
application told the time every 15 minutes (saytime running in cron).
The ntp logging showed me that something strange happened every 15
minutes. I found out it was the loading of the sound module every 
15 minutes.

I think you are possibly fighting flies when elephants are loose ;-)
