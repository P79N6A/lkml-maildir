	Hello Alan & Linus,  So -we- (I mean the users of raid-0.90)
	lose again . More probably until 2.5 at my best guess .
 -	unless may be included  in 2.2.1[3-9] . (looks doubtful)
 -	doesn't look like 2.3 either , which still has broken FS layers
	last I had heard .  So that must leave late 2.3 at best .
 -	Or what may even be more likely 2.5 .
	When do -we- win ? 	Tia,  JimL
