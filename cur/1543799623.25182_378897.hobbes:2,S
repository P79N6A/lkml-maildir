Actually I think memcpy32 is not the thing pathscale wants.  They want
memcpy_{to,from}_io32, because memcpy32 wouldn't be allowed to operate
on I/O mapped memory.  I'd say back to the drawingboard.
And to pathscale:  please get your driver __iomem and endianess annotated
before sending out further core patches, I'm pretty sure getting those
things fixed will shed some light on the actual requirements.
