+2.14 /proc/<pid>/coredump_omit_anonymous_shared - Core dump coordinator
+---------------------------------------------------------------------
+When a process is dumped, all anonymous memory is written to a core file as
+long as the size of the core file isn't limited. But sometimes we don't want
+to dump some memory segments, for example, huge shared memory.
+
+The /proc/<pid>/coredump_omit_anonymous_shared is a flag which enables you to
+omit anonymous shared memory segments from a core file when it is generated.
+When the <pid> process is dumped, the core dump routine decides whether a
+given memory segment should be dumped into a core file or not based on the
+type of the memory segment and the flag.
+
+If you have written a non-zero value to this proc file, anonymous shared
+memory segments are not dumped. There are three types of anonymous shared
+memory:
+
+  - IPC shared memory
+  - the memory segments created by mmap(2) with MAP_ANONYMOUS and MAP_SHARED
+    flags
+  - the memory segments created by mmap(2) with MAP_SHARED flag, and the
+    mapped file has already been unlinked
+
+Because current core dump routine doesn't distinguish these segments, you can
+only choose either dumping all anonymous shared memory segments or not.
+
+If you don't want to dump all shared memory segments attached to pid 1234,
+write 0 to the process's proc file.
+
+  $ echo 1 > /proc/1234/coredump_omit_anonymous_shared
+
+When a new process is created, the process inherits the flag status from its
+parent. It is useful to set the flag before the program runs.
+For example:
+
+  $ echo 1 > /proc/self/coredump_omit_anonymous_shared
+  $ ./some_program
