That's an example.  There is no "should" with that example.

That's perfectly fine.  The "formal" syntax is given later in that file:
The format of the block comment is like this:
/**
 * function_name(:)? (- short description)?
(* @parameterx(space)*: (description of parameter x)?)*
(* a blank line)?
 * (Description:)? (Description of function)?
 * (section header: (section description)? )*
(*)?*/
and those parentheses are (confusing) grouping characters, not literals.  :(

File a bug with debian?

Nope.  I prefer a single space, but some people seem to prefer tab(s).
