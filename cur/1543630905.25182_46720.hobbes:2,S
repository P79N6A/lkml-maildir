Sorry, this doesn't work here either: this would return the wrong
value from read.
Of course, everyone who does more than one copy_to_user should be
checking that return value, and not doing:
	if (copy_to_user(uptr....) 
	   || copy_to_user(uptr+10,....) 
		return -EFAULT
So that such gc schemes actually work,
Rusty.
