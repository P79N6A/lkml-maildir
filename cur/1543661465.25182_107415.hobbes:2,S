Did you check the obvious such as your BIOS is set to the right cpu
frequency?
It's possible you BIOS was reset and the CPU multiplier is not set
correctly.
When the system boots, what does the BIOS report the CPU as?
Intel Celeron running at: ??
Try that first.

Hi!
I have a Toshiba Satelite S2210CDT.
There is a problem with detecting CPU frequency.
It runs on 258Mhz, but it is an 500Mhz Celeron kernels 2.4.19-pre7-ac4
and 2.4.20.
i attach the configs and the output of lscpi, /proc/cpu
