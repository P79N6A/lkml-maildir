Would putting a range check and BUG() in the ISA macros for now help there.
Reminds me - we have a request_mem_region problem to address that is sort
of related to all this. Right now we reserve mem regions without knowing
properly about ISA mappings. That means drivers are reserving stuff like
0xD0000. Unfortunately on some non X86 boxes the ISA hole isnt at 640K-1M
so it appears we want an  isa_request_mem_region and friends to handle those
platforms ?
