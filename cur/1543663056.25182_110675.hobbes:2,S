This limitation is quite horrible.
Does the implementation have to be perfect? The per_cpu API can easily
be simulated using good old NR_CPUS arrays:
#if LINUX_VERSION_CODE >= KERNEL_VERSION(2,5,8) && !defined(MODULE)
#include <linux/percpu.h>	/* why doesn't this work for modules? */
#else
/* Simulate per_cpu() for older kernels or modular builds. */
#define DEFINE_PER_CPU(type, name) \
	__typeof__(type) name[NR_CPUS] __cacheline_aligned
#define per_cpu(var, cpu)	((var)[(cpu)])
#endif
Yes it wastes space. Big deal. Rather that than arbitrary limitations.
