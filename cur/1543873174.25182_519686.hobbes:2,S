I think we could rely on subsystems maintainers to let us know if
there are potential problems. For example I can tell that neither
input, serio nor gameport subsystems use sysfs to destroy their
devices (action on sysfs may cause some other device to be destroyed
but that should be ok, only self-destruction is not allowed, right?)
