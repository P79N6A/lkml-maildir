Sorry. I've not been able to try this ftdi patch yet. My work pc has
ubuntu dapper with 2.6.15 kernel. I've compiled 2.6.21 there but the
leap is too much and there are probably udev incompatibilities so the
/dev entry is not created for any USB device.
I need to install a newer distro to work with mainline.
This mail is just to point out that the patch is not forgotten, just
need more time to try it.
Regards,
  ~ Antonio
