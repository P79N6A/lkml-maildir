IMHO currect behaviour is the Right Thing.  Think of 'cp -al' on
trees.  Patching one does not affect another, because patch()
does not modify files, it creates new file.  If I use your patch
and have 'cp -al'-d trees which happen to have .config inside,
doing 'make *config' in one tree will affect another.  Thats
wrong.
