I am telling you to go single user mode to check if the problem is in
thinkpad-acpi.  Nothing more, nothing less.  AFTER we find out where the
problem is, we see what should be done about it.

What change?  For all we know, it could be a bug.  And if it is not a bug,
read the thinkpad-acpi documentation, and complain to me exactly about
whatever change described in there that is giving you issues.  Or give me a
bissect culprit.  Or do the testing I asked you to do, and tell me the
results.

I will get pissed very fast, if you keep up with this tone.  I certainly did
not send in any changes that should cause what you describe on purpose,
UNLESS you have disabled with the "deprecated" /proc/acpi/event stuff.  In
which case, it is your problem to get proper userspace.
