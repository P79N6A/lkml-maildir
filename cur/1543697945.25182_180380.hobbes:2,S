Hmm, what do you actually mean by "buffer underruns?"
(If I'm correct) do you suggest that we should zero-out rest of 
destination buffer?
if so, we may want to have a function, say strlcpy0(), like this:
size_t strlcpy0(char *dst, const char *src, size_t maxlen)
{
  size_t len = strlcpy(dst, src, maxlen);
  if (maxlen && len < maxlen - 1)
    memset(dst + len + 1, 0, maxlen - len - 1);
  return len;
}
