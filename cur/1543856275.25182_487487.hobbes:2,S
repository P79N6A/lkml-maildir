Subject: [PATCH 34/36] Driver core: platform_driver_probe(), can save codespace
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/1/310

From: David Brownell <david-b@pacbell.net>
This defines a new platform_driver_probe() method allowing the driver's
probe() method, and its support code+data, to safely live in __init
sections for typical system configurations.
Many system-on-chip processors could benefit from this API, to the tune
of recovering hundreds to thousands of bytes per driver.  That's memory
which is currently wasted holding code which can never be called after
system startup, yet can not be removed.   It can't be removed because of
the linkage requirement that pointers to init section code (like, ideally,
probe support) must not live in other sections (like driver method tables)
after those pointers would be invalid.
