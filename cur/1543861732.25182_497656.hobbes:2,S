I understand what you're saying here, but Picasa *is* a port.  They
ship an elf binary that links to winelib and they integrate in native
file pickers for your favourite platform.  If by "port" you mean "GUI
rewrite to use GNOME or KDE" then no, it isn't that, but that doesn't
mean it's not a port.
