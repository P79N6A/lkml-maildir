Hi Pauline.

If a jiffie is indeed 18.2ms then HZ/100 is a good approximation
to HALF a jiffie and HZ/50 a good approximation to one jiffie.
However, the standard used by MSDOS (which I assume is what you're
referring to) is for the clock to tick ~18.2 times per second (to
be more accurate, 65536 ticks per hour), in which case the correct
definition would be that a jiffie is 5*HZ/91 and it can be
approximated by HZ/18 - which is a long way from HZ/100 !!!

The above says "To 12 decimal places, show me the result of dividing
65536 by the 3600 seconds that make up an hour"...
Best wishes from Riley.
