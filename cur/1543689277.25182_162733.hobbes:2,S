Interesting.  I've found that my Athlon XP 2200 is noticably faster at
Gnome than my Athlon MP 1500 (running a UP kernel).  The memory and disk
is the same speed, so only the processor is different, unless the
chipsets make a huge difference.  Of course, both are much faster than
my 1 GHz Athlon laptop, but there's also a large disk/memory speed
difference there.
