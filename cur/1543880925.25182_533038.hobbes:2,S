Dave, Greg,
Here is the trace with 2.6.20.6
I added back in my trace code, as you see.  As you can also see,
agp_amdk7_probe is still not called.
Linux agpgart interface v0.101 (c) Dave Jones
agp_amdk7_init: In function
agp_amdk7_init: Before pci_register_driver
__pci_register_driver: In Function (driver = agpgart-amdk7, multithread = 0)
__pci_register_driver: Before Spinlock
__pci_register_driver: Before Init List Head
__pci_register_driver: Before driver_register
bus_add_driver: In Function (c048e920)
bus_add_driver: Before kobject_set_name
bus_add_driver: error = 0
bus_add_driver: Before kobject_register
bus_add_driver: error = 0
bus_add_driver: Before driver_attach
bus_add_driver: error = 0
bus_add_driver: Before klist_add_tail
bus_add_driver: Before module_add_driver
bus_add_driver: Before driver_add_attrs
bus_add_driver: error = 0
bus_add_driver: Before add_bind_files
bus_add_driver: error = 0
bus_add_driver: Returning 0
__pci_register_driver: error = 0
__pci_register_driver: Before pci_create_newid_file
__pci_register_driver: error = 0
__pci_register_driver: Returning 0
Even when I start X (using the fglrx driver) I still do not see the
probe function being called.
Everything looks successful, too :(
I will try with 2.6.21rc7, but I don't hold out too much hope.
