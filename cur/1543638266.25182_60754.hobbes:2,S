There's just that little overflow problem to worry about,
trailing garbage, encouragement of assumptions about the
maximum size... is that a %d or a %llu or what?
Given n fields and an constant c>5, there will be at least
exp(c,n) ways to parse and generate the data. All will be
implemented. In addition to disagreement over the format,
most parsers will be buggy.
You just like ASCII because that's the Plan 9 way.
There's a time and place for ASCII, and this isn't it.

We should use FORTRAN or Pascal, with overflow/underflow
trapping enabled for integer math and array access. :-)
