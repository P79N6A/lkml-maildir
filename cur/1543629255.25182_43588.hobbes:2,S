Before I found this message I was also trying to hunt down this problem
after noticing that 2.5.12 failed unlink08 from LTP.  The thing I think
broke it though was a seemlingly minor change to the handling of the
return value from exec_permission_lite in link_path_walk().  In 2.5.11
it rechecked with permission() if it got an error back from
exec_permission_lite(), but in 2.5.12 it only does this if err ==
-EAGAIN.  This patch also seems to fix the problem, and simply reverts
it back to the original way it was handled rather than adding more code
to exec_permission_lite().  I'll let you decide which is the best way.
Thanks,
Paul Larson
