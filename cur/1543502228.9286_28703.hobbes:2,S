Suggested rules:
1. Always allow 32-bit calls.
2. Always have 16-bit calls in the kernel. (see below)
3. Let unprivileged processes get garbage UID values. The software
   isn't very dangerous, and it might work fine.
4. If any large UID is ever set for any process, privileged processes
   must not be allowed to make any 16-bit calls. Log the problem,
   stop the process, and return failure if the process continues.
5. Have a run-time config option to kill any privileged process that
   tries to use a 16-bit call.
6. Have a run-time config option to allow 16-bit calls from privileged
   processes that are not setuid.
