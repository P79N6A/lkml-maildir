i dont think this second problem is a practical one: i've test-merged 
mmiotrace two days ago into x86.git and it's holding up very well in my 
testing (it has not caused a single hickup so far). It's nice optional 
debug functionality and i dont see any reason why not to merge it.
a few cleanup requests:
- please make the pagefault callbacks explicit as Arjan has asked
- any reason why it lives in arch/x86/kernel/mmiotrace/? It should be a
  prime-time member of arch/x86/mm/ i think.
- please make it build-in-able, not modules-only.
- [ longer-term: think about integrating pf_in.c with the x86
    emulator/disassembler of KVM. ]
