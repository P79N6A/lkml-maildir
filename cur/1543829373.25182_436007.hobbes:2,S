My head is spinning in a twisty maze of ioctls.  What _should_ we call? 
file_operations.foo_ioctl() or block_device_operations.foo_ioctl() or
blkdev_ioctl()?
I think as far as the user is concerned, file_operations.foo_ioctl(),
because that's what the user would end up calling against /dev/sda. 
Whether that's always, reliably, equivalent to
block_device_operations.foo_ioctl() I am presently disinclined to spare
time to discover.
