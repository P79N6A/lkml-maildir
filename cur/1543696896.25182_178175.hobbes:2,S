I made a cleanup for reiser4 patches (by removing UML-specific changes),
you can see result here: 
http://namesys.com/snapshots/2003.11.17/cleaned-up/
       core.diff.gz               - changes to the core kernel
       reiser4-only-diff.gz       - reiser4 code as a patch
       all.diff.gz                - all in one patch
       reiser4.tar.gz             - reiser4 bk repository (SCCS data included)
