I would be for this, although the situation is really no different than
today with printk()'s, which I would hope could be replaced in some
cases with the events (an either-or kind of deal).  Dunno.

This is a good idea for other reasons, too: the common base of errors
could be certified as supported by the error daemon, translated, etc.
etc.
I am not sure how realistic this goal is, but I do like it, at least for
the general case of the usual errors in drivers.
