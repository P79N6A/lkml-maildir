"at all" is not quite correct. We are fine as long as all the cpus are up
in clustered APIC mode before the IO-APIC RTE's are programmed.
Once the IO-APIC subsystem is up and running and later if the cpu comes online
then we have a window between the INIT/startup IPI message and the place
where we program the DFR and LDR, with in which the IO-APIC will interpret
the logical mode in RTE as 'logical flat' and will probably result in missing
the interrupt.
