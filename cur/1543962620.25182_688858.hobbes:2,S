We don't currently sniff the ACPI timing data on Intel boxes - we can do
so and there is a library routine but I'd be worried about the usual
standard of BIOS code. Right now we only do it for chipsets which are so
braindamaged we have no other choice or where the vendor specifically
implemented and intended the ACPI data to be used for this (eg Nvidia)
