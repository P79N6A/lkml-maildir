I see your point, please try with 2.4.21rc4aa1 or with this patch:
	
http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.4/2.4.21rc4aa1/00_ksoftirqd-max-loop-networking-1
you can put a printk in the ksoftirqd loop and tune the N until it
behaves as you want.

but the loop will do nothing, I mean ksoftirqd is checking if some work
has to be done, and that's achieved in do_softirq, exactly the same that
each irq does before returning to userspace. no difference.

That's a purerly theorical case that also Ingo made once, but you should
do all the theory and also compute the probability of the irqs arriving
at the exact timing that forbids userspace to make progress with the
ksoftirqd design for a significant amount of time. That is too low to
care about it.  While when you're flooded at max speed ksoftirqd
generates a fair load, plus it allows NAPI to work at all which is
needed on firewalls.
The only problem I can see is that the spikes of load may generate
spurious ksoftirqd reschedules, I acknowledge that, and for those we can
just change the #define in teh above patch. I flooded my boxes through
100mbit and ksoftirqd apparently isn't running at all (not that I ever
noticed it running significantly though ;). I don't have gigabit to test
that's why I ask.
