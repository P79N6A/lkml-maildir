Al Viro has a patch for this on his ftp site but you can get over the
compile problemy by simply enabling both nfs and nfs server in the kernel
configuration, no patch needed in that case... I.e. you want to set these:
> # CONFIG_NFS_FS is not set
> # CONFIG_NFS_V3 is not set
> # CONFIG_NFSD is not set
> # CONFIG_NFSD_V3 is not set
And perhaps this one, not sure:
> # CONFIG_ROOT_NFS is not set
Best regards,
Anton
