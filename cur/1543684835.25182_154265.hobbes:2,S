Per your screen dump - it found the cd-rom's on id 3 and 4, but not your
disk drive that was at id 0, and the adapter found something at id 6 (host
adapter is at id 7).
You could try turning on scan logging, it might give more information.
You can turn on the logging at boot time, make sure you have
CONFIG_SCSI_LOGGING on, the information of interest (scan of host 0 chan 0
id 0 lun 0) likely will scroll off screen.
For scan logging, add to your boot line:
	scsi_mod.scsi_logging_level=0x140
To limit the logging info, make sure max_scsi_luns=1 via config or boot
time option scsi_mod.max_scsi_luns=1.
