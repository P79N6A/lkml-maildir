Ouch, that hurts. This is a machine I built myself over three years ago. Ran 
very stably with 2.4.*.  may be  it is the age of the machine.  The  recent 
hardware changes are additions of a dvd writer, a hdd and a pci wireless 
card. Which  seem to work ok until recently. What other diagnostics would 
make sense?

Hmm, it is different one time, as shown below.. I guess should have looked 
carefully. Although  it means nothing to me..  FWIW, please  note that in all 
these cases  ndiswrapper (windows driver loader) is being used. Thanks, Jay
