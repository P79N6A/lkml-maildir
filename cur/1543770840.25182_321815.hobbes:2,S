The logic closing an open usbfs file -- which is done before any task
exits with such an open file -- is supposed to block till all its URBs
complete.  So the pointer to the task "should" be valid for as long as
any URB it's submitted is active.
There have been some changes in that code since last I looked at it.
One obvious change was switching to usb_kill_urb(), but there've been
others too.

It's worth making that change in any case, to avoid such questions in
the future.  And if it does any good, more power to the patch!
Not that it helps at all, but I've never really trusted the usbfs async
I/O code.  "Real AIO" could be a lot more obviously correct.  And smaller.

Odd.  Isn't that nulled only in __exit_sighand(), which gets called only
when the task itself is finally being freed?
