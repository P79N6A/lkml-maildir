That's a good patch.
It is "obviously correct", it saves seven calls to __global_cli() for
each \n-terminated write to the console and it fixes the
death-with-dual-deadlock problem which Mister Owens has been complaining
about.
James has just posted a big patch against this code, so you should
coordinate this with him.
One point: you should have included linux/spinlock.h rather than
asm/spinlock.h.  Obviously someone is already including this file, so
you can simply remove the #include altogether.
