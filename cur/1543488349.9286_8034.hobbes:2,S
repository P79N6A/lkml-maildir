[1.] The letter 'e' spontaneously gets changed to the letter 'a'.
[2.]
  I am not sure if this is a problem with the kernel, the editor I am
using, or maybe it is just a hardware problem.  However, this problem did
not show up until I upgraded to 2.2.0 from 2.0.34.  Here is the situation,
I spend about 6+ hours a day writting a MUD.  I find a bug or something
that needs to be changed so I go and edit the file and recompile the
program.  Once in a while the compiler will stop and give me an error that
there is an undefined variable.  The strange thing is it can even be in a
file that has not been changed for days.  The variable is defined, under a
different name and what happens is an 'a' gets changed to an 'e'.  At
first, I noticed it when I was really tired so I attributed it to that.
However, since I upgraded from 2.0.34, I this is happend atleast 20 times.
A couple of them could be from a legitament typo I made, however it
consitantly happens.  One time a 'p' was changed to a 't', this could have
been my mistake and since it has not happend again it probably was but Im
not sure how.  It is alsoways the lower case 'a' and it only happens one
time per file.  A couple of times it has happened twice in a row.  I would
fix it in one file and then another file, which compiled fine 15minutes
prior and not touched, has the a to e problem.  I will try rebooting with
a 2.0.34 kernel later tonight.  I am using a standard slackware 3.5
installation from the infomagic June 1998 s6-cd developer resource set.
