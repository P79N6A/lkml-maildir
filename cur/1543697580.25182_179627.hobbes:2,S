Greetings;
I also have a bttv (or xawtv) related problem.  At some point in the 
past I figured out howto set it for my local channel 5, ntsc via 
editing something that I don't recall the name of now.  The so-called 
channel editor button on the xawtv gui at that point did nothing, 
nada.
That was a year ago.  Now I've discovered that clicking on the menu's 
channel edit button is the same as the quit 'x', with no messages 
left in the logs indicating a problem.
Is this its current status, or did I manage to fubar something else?
BTW, 2.6.0-test10, using the anticipatory scheduler feels good so far.
