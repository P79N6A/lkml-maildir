It's pretty easy for you to find out. Do a tcpdump -v or ethereal -v 
from both the side of a host you download from and from the linux side.
Then compare all packets. If they don't match the firewall is 
doing something bad. Especially check window values and TCP options
in the SYN packets
It is very very likely the firewall, window scaling works for a lot
of people.
