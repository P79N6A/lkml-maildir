I'm in the process of porting a filesystem from 2.2.12 to 2.4.0test4 and 
have obviously come upon the VFS I/F changes (eg inode_operations, 
address_space_operations etc.).
I have read Richard Gooch's porting page but it only covers the wait queue 
changes.  I've also spent hours reading FAQs, mailing lists and posting to 
the Linux system development newsgroup but can't find anything that 
documents these changes.  Even a thread of discussion about the changes 
would be useful.
While I realise that the source is the ultimate documentation, it's also 
difficult to read at times, and often the reasons why something is done 
cannot be gleaned from the code alone.
So, does anyone know if there is any documentation of the kernel API 
changes (including VFS) for porting 2.2 code to 2.3?
Thanks,
Dave
