That can not be done reliably in user space. I know this; the "top"
program used to try.

Oh please. How many programs use the mount() system call? One?
Most system calls are rarely used. This is OK.

No it can't. You fill it like this:
tmp[0] = p->pid;
tmp[1] = p->uid;
/* ... */
Throw in some pretty symbolic names if you like. It's effectively
a struct, but a real struct would tempt people to use non-64-bit
values. Using an array enforces uniform 64-bit usage.
Good design involves NOT tempting people to write irregular hacks.

Good. Thus you'd like the new system call in place of our
current pile of crud. Unfortunately the crud will need to
remain for at least a decade of transition time.

Huh? The kernel need not parse its own ASCII output. The kernel
natively maintains information in a binary format. The proposed
system call would not parse /proc output!!!

Well, tough luck. Learn to use an editor with search ability.
Even "less" and Netscape can search.

The proposed system call was implemented for an embedded system.
This allowed operation without the /proc filesystem, which is
some serious bloat.

If you think /proc is speedy and small...
