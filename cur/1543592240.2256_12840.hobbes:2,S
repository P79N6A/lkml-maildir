Alan,
I have a dual athlon on the 760MP chipset.
2.2.20pre1 and 2 dont work. I got it to work partly after applying Johannes Erdfel's
760MP patch in io_apic.c. Even after applying the patch, there are messages like
hdc: IRQ probe failed(0)
hdd: IRQ probe failed(0)
hde: IRQ probe failed(0)
hdc: lost interrupt
hdc: lost interrupt
and then the machine hangs randomly. I an guessing the io_apic does not route the interrupts
correctly.
