2.4.19 and 2.4.20 crashes, 2.4.18 as distributed with Debian 3.0's
installation system works fine, but it needs to be told where the IDE
channels are. It seems that the change in 2.4.18->2.4.19 that
introduces support for recognizing where the FastTrak card has its IDE
channels somehow causes the crash. However, manually specifying the IDE
channels on the command line as for 2.4.18 does not make 2.4.19/20 stop
crashing.

Please see the previous post.
