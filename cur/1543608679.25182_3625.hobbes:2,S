Subject: File resource leak in 2.2.19?

I came to my work cluster only to find node4 dead. On the console, 
"VFS: file-max limit 4096 reached"
Trying to login gave an error message about loading the shared libraries 
required (since it couldn't get a file descriptor to load it, I guess)
The exact situation is an NFS share, hosted on a computer called 'node4'; 
files are accessed a couple of thousand times daily, read/write from a single 
other machine thru user-space NFS daemon from Progeny 1.0, which then relays 
X and/or VNC to a given Windows workstation. That's about the only access 
pattern to the files.
It's possible that the said files will open from the node itself (Without 
going thru NFS, but thru a strategically placed symlink), but I sincerely 
doubt it happened.
Is there any known resource leak in 2.2.19 and up ('only' patched with MOSIX 
0.98.0) that will exaust the available 'open file' resources?
Yours Truly,
