You really need 4 pages?
There's no way to reliably get 4 consecutive pages when you're even close
to being low on memory. I would suggest just failing with a NULL return
here.
What is the architecture setup for this machine? I have no clue about
S/390 memory management. Maybe you can modify the pmd layout?
One potential fix for this is to just make the page size bigger. Make
"Linux pages" be _two_ hardware pages, and make a Linux pte contain two
"hardware pte's". That way the pmd would be an order-1 allocation instead
of an order-2 one. Which is statistically _much_ more likely to be around
(exponential distribution).
