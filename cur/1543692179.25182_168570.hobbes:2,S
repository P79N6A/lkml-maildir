What are you talking about?  Arches that don't like/support unaligned
accesses will certainly have a copy_user() which handles misalignment
just fine.  For example, on ia64, the copy will run slightly slower
because of an additional shift in the loop, but that penalty only
shows on fully cached data.  If the data is not cached, the copy speed
for aligned vs. misaligned data is virtually the same.

That's what I proposed.

I suspect you'd be better off just copying the 14 bytes of the
Ethernet header so that the entire packet is contiguous.
