Somehow it is trying to execute code in the middle of an instruction.
That almost never works, even when the resulting fragment is a legal
opcode. :)
The real instruction is:
    3b 87 68 01 00 00 00        cmp    0x168(%edi),%eax
I'd guess you have some kind of hardware problem.  It could also be
a kernel problem where the saved address was corrupted during an
interrupt, but that's not likely.
