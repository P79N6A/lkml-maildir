Nice :-)

Hmmm, you've done away with a lot of cleanup in one big swoop under
suspicion of what exactly causes the performance loss ... so I'd rather
wait till you pinpoint the exact cause.

Why would an inline function be slower than a macro? If you're
worried that gcc may ignore to inline them (which is unlikely as it is
with -O2), you can use __always_inline ... inline functions do provide
type-checking.

Again, I wonder whether the programmer's opinion to keep something in
the registers is necessarily better than the compiler's. Especially when
gcc would quite likely ignore your register hint in any case, can't think
of too many reasons to use register these days ...

Right, it'd be nice if you do a step-by-step cleanup to find what exactly
caused the performance hit.

I wonder if you could try and use crypto/tcrypt.c -- the debugfs test
module involves userspace, the VFS layer etc ... tcrypt otoh is fully
within the kernel so less likely to introduce spurious noise to the numbers
and better suited to performance benchmarking.

You could try and rollback this change too. Also, try to get results
on various arch's yourself (if you can lay your hands on some x86-64
/ sparc64 / etc boxen).
Otherwise, if it's still slower (and we're talking >10% here), there's not
much reason why we shouldn't stay with Richard's patches itself. You
could try and do cleanups to that itself (if Richard's fine with it and as
long as you retain performance).
