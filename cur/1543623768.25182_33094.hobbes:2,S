You need to change loops that do something like:
    while(something)
    {
        current->policy |= SCHED_YIELD;
        schedule();
    }
    
    to:
    while(something)
        sys_sched_yield();

You can try to ask Marcelo to add a line in include/linux/sched.h and one
in kernel/ksym.c
In this way a compatibility interface can be achieved for code that needs it.
