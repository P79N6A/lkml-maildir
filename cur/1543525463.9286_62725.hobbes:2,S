Ok.  I can try that, I'd rather do this when the 3c575_cb.c file is fixed
for the netdevice.h changes.  I tried doing what davem said in his mail
about what to change, but this driver does somethings that I don't
understand very well and I can't get it to work right.
By the way, I got an odd lockup (probably what I meantioned above) with the
card services running along with the above module loaded.  System completely
freezes except it still allows me to alt-sysrq-<key>.
Right now, I'm having some wrist problems, so I can't try this tonight (I'm
est and I got up early thismorning)
