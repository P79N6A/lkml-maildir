Hi,
I have a query concerning includes with the paride stuff in
drivers/block/paride.
From what I have been able to tell, the paride relies on 'linux/wait.h'
being included via some really strange lists of includes via architecture
specific (include/asm-*) includes.
In the case of x86, the path is:
aten.o:
  asm-i386/io.h
    linux/vmalloc.h
      linux/sched.h
	linux/binfmts.h
	  linux/capability.h
	    linux/fs.h
	      linux/wait.h
On alpha, asm-alpha/io.h does not include linux/vmalloc.h, so I suspect
that the paride stuff does not compile on the alpha (can someone verify
this please.  If it does compile, please send me
linux/drivers/block/paride/.depend and linux/.hdepend).
The same appears to exist in most of the others (including the ARM io.h).
For the ARM, I have had to explicitly add linux/wait.h to each file in
linux/drivers/block/paride to get them to compile.
Are these files supposed to be generic?  If they are, it would be a good
idea to get the includes fixed in them so that they are not relying on
the include structure of the x86 include files (or any other architecture
specific include files).
