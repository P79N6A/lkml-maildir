Wasn't it the other way around? Some Samsung CD-ROMs sent 65534 bytes
per interrupt because the specs allow it. But Linux can't cope with read
size that is not multiple of 512. So AFAIK we force the transfer size
down on some Samsungs (SCR **30 was one of these IIRC).
Doesn't look like this problem has anything in common with the original
question.
