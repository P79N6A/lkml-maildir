Hmm, I agree, if there are multiple entries with the same card ID then
only the first ID would be matched.  I could add some code to match_card()
so that it checks to see if all of the devices in the list are present.
This would, however, break ALSA's current policy of enabling a card, even
if some of its device components are unavailabe.  Could you provide any
specific examples of multiple entries with the same card ID?  I'd like to
look at some closer.

Only a device ID, but those device IDs can reside on isapnp cards.
