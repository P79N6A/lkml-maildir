That's a valid point to make but it can ;)

Yeah, and I'm nearly there to have a RAID4 and RAID5 target for dm
(which took advantage of the raid address calculation and the bio to
stripe cache copy code of md raid5).
See 
http://people.redhat.com/heinzm/sw/dm/dm-raid45/dm-raid45_2.6.15_200601201914.patch.bz2
 (no Makefile / no Kconfig changes) for early code reference.

Yes, that's possible but there's recommendations to have a native target
for dm to do RAID5, so I started to implement it.
