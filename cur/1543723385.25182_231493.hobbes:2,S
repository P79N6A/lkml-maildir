I'm referring to all of the code segments like this:
        +       if (PageAgain(page)) {
        +               unlock_page(page);
        +               page_cache_release(page);
        +               goto again;
        +       }
        +       BUG_ON(PageAgain(page));
        
For any page that's in the page cache that you want to remove, simply
take the page lock, overwrite page->mapping, and the page cache code
will take care of the rest, no PG_again needed.

Do you mean pages in the swap cache?
