I got into a bragging game whose webserver is the fastest with Jim Nelson
one of the authors of the boa webserver. We finally settled on the Zeus
test to decide the battle.
First boa won hands down because it supports persistant connections. Boa
on port 6000. Khttpd on port 80:
clameter@melchi:~$ ./zb localhost /index.html -k -c 215 -n 20000 -p 6000

Then we decided to switch persistant connection off... But boa still wins.
clameter@melchi:~$ ./zb localhost /index.html -c 215 -n 20000 -p 6000

This shows the following problems with khttpd:
1. Connect times are on average longer than boa. Why???
2. Transfers also take longer,
What is wrong here? I would expect transferates of a 3-4 megabytes over a
localhost interface. The file is certainly in some kind of cache.
