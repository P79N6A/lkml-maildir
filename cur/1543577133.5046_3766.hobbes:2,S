Hmm.. If I'm not mistaken, this is in dentry_iput() (inline function
called by prune_one_dentry(), which is _also_ an inline function, which
is why it gets reported as being in prune_dcache):
	if (dentry->d_op && dentry->d_op->d_iput)
		dentry->d_op->d_iput(dentry, inode);
and it looks like your dentry->d_op has a value of 0x01000000, so when we
load the d_op->d_iput pointer, we get a page fault.
The strange thing is that 0x01000000 value, which almost certainly should
just be NULL. A one-bit error.
Now, I assume this machine has been historically stable, with no history
of memory corruption problems.. It's entirely possible (and likely) that
the one-bit error is due to some wild kernel pointer. Which makes this
_really_ hard to debug.
I'll try to think about it some more, but I'd love to have more reports to
go on to try to find a pattern..
