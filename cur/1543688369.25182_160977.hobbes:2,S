Thanks Guillaume, so not very good. Its interesting that there can
be such a big difference in performance, but its a very simple app
so makes a good test for the specific regression.
In both Con's and my patches, the reader gets a bit more CPU. This
might be due to it preempting the writer more often on wakeups,
which would lead to more scheduling per work done and a regression.
If this is the case, I'm not sure the behaviour is too undesirable
though: its often very important for woken processes to be run
quickly. Its not clear that this workload is something we would
want to optimize for. Assuming the problem is what I guess.
I will take a look into it further when I get time tomorrow.
