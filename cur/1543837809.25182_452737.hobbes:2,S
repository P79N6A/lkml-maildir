I've haven't decided yet. I put it out for review for now at least.
I got various reports of the VIA bridges having trouble with DAC over the
years, but usually when I asked for confirmation the reporters disappeared.
I finally did the patch now because with cheap 2GB DIMMs VIA systems
with 4GB (which gives some memory over 4GB) are becomming more common.
But again the last reporters disappeared this time.
I will probably not sent it off before final confirmation again.

I prefer it this way.

The if()? Possible.

For hardware workarounds it is usually best to have three values:
- Force disabled
- Default based on black/white list 
  The black/white list is not active when != 0
- Force enabled
I tend to use -1/0/1 for this.
