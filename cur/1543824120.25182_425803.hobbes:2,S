You need an editor that auto-saves regularly.  May I suggest emacs ;-)
One of my biggest grips about the current fad of web-based
interactions is that you get to use the editor built into your browser
rather than your editor of choice - and the editor built into firefox
is pretty lame....
Now if only firefox could embed a window from my running emacs ....
Or to put it another way:  you don't need to save the whole system
state: just save the bits you actually need to save.
