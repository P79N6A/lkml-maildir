All very nicely said.
I'd like to add that an insult implicit in the attempt to remove the BSD 
license is that it says to the original authors, "we plan to improve 
this code, and when we do you'll never again be able to ship it as 
BSD."  They weren't the words, but that's what you get when you think to 
the future.
Although opinions seem still to be divided, I think everyone has been 
reminded that just because you can doesn't mean you should.

The one shining light in this whole sorry Atheros saga is that it's now 
all history; the only people still talking about it are people not 
directly involved.  The matter could now rest...
