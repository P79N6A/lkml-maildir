It can be done entirely in userspace, if you want it.  Just hack your
shell to examine some extended attribute of your choice, and adjust
the nice value before executing files.  Then arrange to have the shell
run with a negative nice value.  This can be easily accomplished with
a simple wrapper, only for the shell.
