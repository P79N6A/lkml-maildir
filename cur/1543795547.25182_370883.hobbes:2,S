If it's a 640 pixel width image and you've got the right font loaded, the
VGA function 0x08 will get you the character at the current cursor position.
It's also used by PRTSCR, so pressing it in a DOS viewer may dump the text
to LPT1. If you redirected it to a serial console, you might also catch it.
(I never tried).
