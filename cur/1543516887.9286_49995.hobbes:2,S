Hello,
With kernel 2.2.9, I got the following messages:
Nov 23 20:33:07 linuix kernel: try_to_unuse: entry 000e4200 count=1
Nov 23 20:33:07 linuix kernel: rw_swap_page: Trying to read unallocated swap (000e4200)
Nov 23 20:33:07 linuix kernel: swap_duplicate at c01207f6: entry 000e4b00, unused page
Most processes that I then started ("ps", "ls -l /tmp", "ipcs", ...) got
stuck in an interruptible state. Eventually I rebooted.
==> What I had been doing:
Under X, start clisp under gdb and, every 3 seconds, start a new process
doing "ls -l /tmp/foobar". Simultaneously, two gcc crosscompilations.
Let this run for 10 hours. Then the swap space looked like this:
Filename                        Type            Size    Used    Priority
/dev/bmem                       partition       24572   24368   -1
/dev/hdb5                       partition       50364   9800    -2
/dev/hda6                       partition       50048   0       -3
(/dev/bmem is a fast, RAM based swap space.) Then I did "swapoff /dev/bmem".
It took around two minutes, and effectively moved the used swap pages from
/dev/bmem to /dev/hdb5. Then I did "swapon -p 1 /dev/bmem". The fast swap
space was back with highest priority, but the system still fest sluggish.
A few minutes later, the kernel problem appeared.
Btw, my X server uses ca. 3 MB of shared memory, so shared memory swapping
might be involved too.
==> Hardware:
  CPU: 486,
  Disks: 2 IDE disks from WD (no problems ever, last change one year ago)
  RAM: 16 MB (used reliably for 2 years)
  /dev/bmem: 24 MB uncachable RAM (used reliably for 2 years too)
