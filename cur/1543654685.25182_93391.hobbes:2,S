Yes, it can. If the flash chips are identical and arranged consecutively 
with no space between them, the chip drivers will register them all as one 
MTD device anyway. It'll even deal with finding multiple aliases of each 
chip. 
Or if you have different types of flash chip you can use the 'mtdconcat' 
driver to combine them.
This kind of question is more likely to get a useful answer on the MTD 
mailing list (linux-mtd@lists.infradead.org). Certainly not linux-net@vger.
