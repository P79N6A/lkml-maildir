Subject: [BUG] USB input death then system freeze

Most recent kernel where this bug did *NOT* occur: pre 2.6.21 mm
kernels, non-mm 2.6.22-rc2
Distribution: Fedora Devel
Hardware Environment: EHCI input on external powered hub with CK804 mainboard
Software Environment: Nothing specific
Problem Description:
After a few hours of activity 2.6.22-rc1-mm1 and 2.6.22-rc2-mm1 will lose USB
HID INPUT (keyboard or mice with no priority), then the system will freeze
If the mouse/tackball is lost first switching to the console and moving the ball
will output random text. Restarting gpm will rescue the mouse (but the system
will lock up soon after anyway)
Same system with similar config works fine with mainline or older mm kernels
Last trace capture in logs before lockup:
Kernel:
drivers/hid/usbhid/hid-core.c: input irq status -75 received
Xorg:
ProcXCloseDevice to close or not ?
ProcXCloseDevice to close or not ?
(II) nek4k-enhanced-usb-0000:00:02.1-8.1/input1: Off
(II) track-expl-usb-0000:00:02.1-8.3/input0: Off
Steps to reproduce:
Just run the system for some time
More info there (logs, configs, etc)
