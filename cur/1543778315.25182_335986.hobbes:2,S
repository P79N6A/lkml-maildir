Does that imply that Windows actually has such non-BIOS code, or just 
knows how to find the BIOS code better, or knows how to do other things, 
or ???

I like your first thought better, "Linux ACPI expects BIOS to contain 
all the necessary stuff" I have a bunch of laptops of various ages, and 
I would expect at least the most recent, an ASUS 16??, using a 
"Centrino" chipset, to be supported. It's one of the top few laptopl 
chipsets, and Windows can suspecd it. Can also not only detect but use 
the 1400x1050 screen, but that's another issue :-(
Is it possible that the code to find these capabilities is not fully 
functional? That seems more likely than the system not having the 
capability. NOTE: "seems" as in experienced guess unsupported by other 
relevant information.
