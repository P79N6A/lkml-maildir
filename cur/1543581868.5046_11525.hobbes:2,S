Cool.
FWIW, people can also download Alan's patches and Linus' pre-patches
from my 'gkernel' CVS at sourceforge.  Instructions for anoncvs are on
the SourceForge home page, near the bottom:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/
Check out module 'linux_2_2' or 'linux_2_4'.  You --MUST-- use a branch
tag when checking out.  Branch tags are named based on kernel version,
ie.:
	REL_2_4_1_ac11
	REL_2_2_19_pre10
	REL_2_4_2_pre3
Using CVS allows easy diff'ing of the full kernel
> cvs -z9 rdiff -u -r REL_2_4_1_ac10 -r REL_2_4_1_ac11 linux_2_4
or just a part of the tree
> cvs -z9 rdiff -u -r REL_2_4_1_ac10 -r REL_2_4_1_ac11 linux_2_4/drivers/net
(as a side note, if you s/REL/hack/ in the above tag names, you get my
public CVS tree...)
Any questions, or anyone wanting my CVS import/merge scripts, just let
me know.
