Why do you need to ask this question of the operating system.
Surely more suitable questions are:
Where are the CD writing devices?
Where is the user's preferred CD writing device?
Surely you don't care if there is a scsi tape drive or scsi hard disk on 
the SCSI bus. Don't you only care about CD writing devices?
