->I've just received a Dell PowerEdge 1300, and I've decided to install one
->kernel-2.0 partition and one kernel-2.2 partition in the same HD. As the
->HD has 4.5GB, I splitted it into 2.1GB / 2.1GB / 149MB (swap).
->
->Well, first partition boots fine, second partition can't boot (LILO just
->shows "Loading 2" and that's it).

->How can I solve this ?? Will I have to repartition the HD ?? IS it
->impossibile to have the system working using the aforementioned partition
->scheme ??
I *think* it is b/c of the 1024 cylinder limit.
Just put the 2nd kernel on the first parition and have add it to lilo.conf
on the first partion. then add 'root' pointing to second partition.
Something like:
boot=/dev/hda1
install=/boot/boot.b
map=/boot/map
read-only
image=/boot/vmlinuz20
        label=Linux20
	root=/dev/hda1
image=/boot/vmlinuz22
        label=Linux22
	root=/dev/hda2
