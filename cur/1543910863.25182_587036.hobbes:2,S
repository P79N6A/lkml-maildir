Thank you for your information and help,
I think it's a lot more clear for me now.
I've seen the ldd3 some time ago, but someone told me that book was
out-of-date. Guess he was wrong. Would it also be use full to use some
kind of cross-compiler? (don't know if that's the right word for it)
So I can run my stable kernel and on top of it a new experimental
kernel where I can experiment with?
