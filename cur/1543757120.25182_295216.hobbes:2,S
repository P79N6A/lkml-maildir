That might be a useful option.  Not my area to comment on.
We would also require, at least as an option, to be able to force the
migration on demand.  Some of our big honkin iron parallel jobs run with
a high degree of parallelism, and nearly saturate each node being used. 
For jobs like that, it can be better to get everything in place, before
resuming execution.
