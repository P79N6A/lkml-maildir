Actually on zaurus one led is labeled "CHARGING" and second is labeled
"MAIL". There are PC keyboards with "MAIL" led already, I
believe... It does not seem to be that bad fit. I do not think you
want to label leds by colors, machine may well have three green leds
(see normal pc keyboard). And on most machines you do not even know
what color the leds are (new notebooks like blue leds :-().
So right solution seems to be adding LED_MAIL and LED_CHARGING and be
done with that...
