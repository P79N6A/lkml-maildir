Search for the word "soap" in ChangeLog-2.6.6
and you'll find a very long and informative essay by akpm.
arch/arm26/machine/small_page.c has been converted to use page->lru
instead in 2.6.6, is that not working for you?  Or is there somewhere
else that needs changing?
I notice the comment in small_page.c says you're using
page->next_hash and pprev_hash - they went away long ago!
