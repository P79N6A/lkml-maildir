Fair enough for a radix tree.  Andrea, remember that page
tables don't need to be balanced either, for obvious reasons ;)

Nice touch.  That should really help keep the cost of the
prio_tree down in the common case.
Your stuff is so much nicer than the kb-trees I was thinking
about a year or two ago ... ;)
