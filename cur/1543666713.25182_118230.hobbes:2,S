Yes, this was the behaviour of the old config tools, which was restored 
with 2.5.65. This means 'm' is a marker that this thing works only as a 
module.
If you want the other behaviour, that it can only be built as a module in 
a modular kernel, but compile it into a nonmodular kernel, you can use "m 
|| !MODULES" instead.
