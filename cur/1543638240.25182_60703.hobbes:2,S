Syscalltrack is only for tracking system calls. If the process creation
was requested from user-space, then indeed syscalltrack will show it.
It won't see kernel threads, among many other things. Not to mention
that it has to play around with the system call table to get its
information.
Now that you mention it, however, it is clear to me that syscalltrack
could definitely use the tracing framework provided by LTT in many
areas. First and foremost, it could get its system call information
using the existing trace hooks provided by LTT. In addition, instead
of implementing yet another event buffering framework, it could
use LTT's trace driver which already provides very efficient buffering.
Yet another reason to include LTT in the kernel.
