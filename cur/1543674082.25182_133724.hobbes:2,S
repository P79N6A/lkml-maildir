Yes, it has been used in laptops (some Gateway models, for instance), but I 
suspect strangely broken configurations of this chip are more common than 
laptops using it, and I don't expect the power saving to be that dramatic. 
Those machines are pretty good for battery life anyway, considering the 
high-end (for the time) configurations.  (btw: I no longer have one)
