sys_remap_file_pages() will call install_page() under down_read(mmap_sem). 
It relies upon page_table_lock for pte atomicity.

Have the ppc64 and sparc64 people reviewed and acked the change?  (Not a
facetious question - I just haven't been following the saga sufficiently
closely to remember).

Confused.  Why not just spin on the lock in the normal manner?

No, I couldn't do that - that's what the collective brain is for.
Look, I'm sorry, but this patch is highly atypical.  Few have this much
trouble.  I have queazy feeling about it (maybe too low-level locking,
maybe inappropriate to other architectures, only addresses a subset of
workloads on a tiny subset of machines, doesn't seem to address all uses of
the lock, etc) and I know that others have had, and continue to have
similar feelings.  But if we could think of anything better, we'd have said
so :(   It's a diffucult problem.
If the other relvant architecture people say "we can use this" then perhaps
we should grin and bear it.  But one does wonder whether some more sweeping
design change is needed.
