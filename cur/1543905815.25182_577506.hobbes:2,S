I have a patch for it already, which is rolled into some other work I'm doing in
there.  Since I had a bit of a false start with the recent coredump work, now
that its in -mm I want to give that a chance to settle out and get some testing.
Once its gotten a few weeks of testing and no one else pops up with some other
requests/additions/etc, I'll post my cleanups, which will include your request
above.
