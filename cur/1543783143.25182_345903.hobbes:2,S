Yes. I applied the patch, booted my system (which was crashing on bootup before
due to out of memory errors due to the leak) ran the scan a few times and verified
/proc/meminfo didn't continually decrease like without it, and rebooted again.
If there is anything else you would like me to do, I would be happy to do so.
