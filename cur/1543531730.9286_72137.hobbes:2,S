	Yeah...  If you went straight from 2.3.48 to 2.3.99* without
stopping at any other version, I can take a good guess...
	In either 2.3.50 or 2.3.51 they changed some shared memory
initialization stuff and now you need to "mount" the shm file system.
	Add the following line to your /etc/fstab file:
	none      /var/shm      shm     defaults        0 0
	Make the /var/shm directory and then run "mount /var/shm" and
shared memory should now work.  If you chose a directory other than
/var/shm, you have to change some kernel tunning parameters in /proc,
so you can't just plug it in any which where.  By adding it to /etc/fstab,
you'll get it mounted properly when you boot up.
	My guess is that this will fix your smbd problem since that's
what's failing.
