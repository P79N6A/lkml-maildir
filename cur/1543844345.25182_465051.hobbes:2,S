I kind of fail to follow here. Do you want to switch TIFM_CORE -> MMC_TIFM_SD dependency into
MMC_TIFM_SD -> TIFM_CORE + TIFM_7XX1 one? It may be slightly more convenient for users (even
though most are using pre-compiled kernels provided by distribution), but will be logically
incorrect, doesn't it? And then, what will become of memorystick driver?
