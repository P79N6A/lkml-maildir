You are probably right, a resonably harmless bug should not be enough to 
justify a rushed 2.4.19 release. But the confusion and "bad publicity" 
/might/ justify it.
I personally don't think that the publicity issue is something that the 
kernel people should be concerned about, but user confusion probably is 
- confused users submitting bug reports and/or patches against two 
different 2.4.18 versions sounds to me like something that you want to 
keep to a minimum, and the only way I see of removing that confusion is 
to get 2.4.18 out of the way and replaced with 2.4.19 as soon as possible.
