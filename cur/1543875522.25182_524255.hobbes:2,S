Subject: [RFC: 2.6.21 patch] let PCI_MSI depend on EXPERIMENTAL
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

We had during the last months have quite a few MSI bugs and even 
regressions due to:
- core kernel bugs,
- device driver bugs and
- hardware bugs
OTOH, MSI doesn't bring any real advantages for most users.
Let's therefore mark PCI_MSI as EXPERIMENTAL.
