Subject: 2.4.2-ac calls FS truncate w/o BKL

The added vmtruncate calls in the ac series trigger calls to the FS
truncate without the BKL held.  Easy enough to fix on the reiserfs side,
but if other filesystems care we might want to change vmtruncate to grab
the lock before calling truncate (and update the Locking doc ;-)
