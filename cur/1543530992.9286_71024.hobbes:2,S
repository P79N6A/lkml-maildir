It is not that difficult; lm_sensors does exactly this when building.
Its Makefile looks in $(LINUX_HEADERS)/linux/autoconf.h (and
$(LINUX)/.config and $(LINUX_HEADERS)/linux/config.h for older kernels)
to determine whether it needs MOD_VERSIONS and SMP declarations. 
It then compiles the modules in a sensible way, without ever writing
to your kernel tree.
If people are interested, I could strip it of all lm_sensors-specific 
things and put it somewhere public.
