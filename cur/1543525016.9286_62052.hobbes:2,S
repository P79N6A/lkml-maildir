  Hi, all. Version 99.11 of my devfs patch is now available from:
http://www.atnf.csiro.au/~rgooch/linux/kernel-patches.html
The devfs FAQ is also available here.
This work has been sponsored by SGI.
NOTE: the devfs-patch-v99.x patches are maintenance patches for the
2.2.x production kernels. Devfs development is done against recent
development kernels. Occasionally, the latest devfs patch for the
development kernels may be backported to 2.2.x series, but this
happens rarely.
This is against 2.2.14. Highlights of this release:
- Ported devfs-patch-v99.10 to kernel 2.2.14
- Moved /dev/tty0 to /dev/vc/0
				Regards,
					Richard....
