NUMA boxes with discontiguous physical memory.  You may not boot off
node 0.  Whichever node you boot from may not be able to see all of
physical memory yet, the cross node directrories may not be set up.
The boot node may not even have physical address 0.  I don't say that
these boxes exist yet but they are possible with discontiguous memory
architectures.

I have some code in insmod that you can use ...  Nasty is an
understatement.
