This has been explained to you before, search your email archives...
The main problem that has been seen in the field SMP packet ordering, 
but a secondary problem observed is cache misses.  Just NAPI mitigates 
this somewhat (no pun intended).
Overall, kirqd should be avoided except in special situations.  It 
doesn't know about such policy things as network-specific or 
storage-specific irq balancing (and shouldn't).
