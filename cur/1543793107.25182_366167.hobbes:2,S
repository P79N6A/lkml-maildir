But in this case -Werror-implicit-function-declaration doesn't create 
new compile errors, it only moves compile errors from compile time to 
link or depmod time - which is IMHO not a bad change.
If you really want to keep the status quo, you can still steal the 
following from sparc64:
  extern unsigned long virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map(volatile void *addr);
  #define virt_to_bus virt_to_bus_not_defined_use_pci_map
  extern unsigned long bus_to_virt_not_defined_use_pci_map(volatile void *addr);
  #define bus_to_virt bus_to_virt_not_defined_use_pci_map
Would a patch to mark the ISA legacy functions as __deprecated be OK?
This might give some motivation for people to convert drivers and would 
avoid new code like the recently introduced kexec to use this obsolete 
API.

Thanks, I've tried it.
Other problems I found until I gave up on compiling:
- a problem in sk98lin indirectly corrected by my SkPciWriteCfgDWord() 
  patch
- drivers/net/wireless/tiacx/: missing #include <linux/vmalloc.h>'s
  (see my patch) - this seems to be a real bug
