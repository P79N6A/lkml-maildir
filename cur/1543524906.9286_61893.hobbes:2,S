Read linux/Documentation/spinlocks.txt.
Basically, critical sections should usually be
spin_[un]lock_irq{save,restore}.  This even evaluates down to
save_flags/cli/restore_flags on UP.
If your critical section need not be guarded against interrupts, you can
use the simpler and faster spin_[un]lock variants.
there are also reader/writer spinlocks, if your device accesses follow
that pattern.
