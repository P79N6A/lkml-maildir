Hi folks,
I've looked around, but haven't been able to find any mbox-format
archives of linux-kernel. Does anything like that exist? It would be
really useful to me right now, just because of some network
connectivity problems I'm in the midst of. Downloading mbox files
looks like my best shot at keeping up with lkml for now.
Many thanks,
Zack
