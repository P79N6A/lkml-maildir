I was just trying to say that anything is possible (there are no
limitations inherent to the design), but I prefer it the way it is now.
I don't feel strongly about it should something different turn out to
be the preferred method of tool authors.

Simple: The fact that a field is subject to access restrictions is part
of the field ID. You can check that nproc.h contains this:
/* Access control (unused) */
#define NPROC_PERM_MASK		0x00300000
#define NPROC_PERM_USER		0x00100000
#define NPROC_PERM_ROOT		0x00200000
So even if a tool were to discover a new, previously unknown field offered
by the kernel, it could immediately tell that access restrictions apply and
what type they are (in case you wonder, there's extra space in reserve to
cover additional types of restrictions, including some catch-all thing (say
NPROC_PERM_COMPLEX_WHICH_MEANS_YOU_HAD_BETTER_KNOW_WHAT_YOU'RE_DOING)). So
nproc can cover everything /proc does today and is ready to go way beyond
that -- should that ever be deemed a good thing.
