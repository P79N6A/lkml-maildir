Hmm, thanks for the bug report.  I'll fix that rather silly bit of
code..... there.  The next release won't have that bug.

There's that silver tongue again.  It makes one feel all warm
inside....

Yes, you haven't told it what defines "/dev/md0", so it assumes the
first device listed will define it, but /dev/dasda doesn't so....
You have to tell mdadm how to recognise /dev/md0.  Possibly by UUID.
Possibly by "minor number".
e.g.
 DEVICE partitions
 ARRAY /dev/md0 super-minor=0
which means "if you find any devices listed in /proc/partitions which
contains an MD superblock which has a "md_minor" field of "0", then
use those to assemble /dev/md0.
This will often be what you want, but might not always.  e.g. if you
have plugged in a drive that was part of /dev/md0 in another machine,
then mdadm will have no way of knowing which drive is the "right" one.
