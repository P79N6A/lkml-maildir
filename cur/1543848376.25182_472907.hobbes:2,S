This is also a risk for users who have a partition that was poorly
setup with an earlier version that allowed it to almost work. If there
is data on that partition refusing to mount it can lead to massive
data loss akin to a broken disk drive.
<<jdow>> I'd propose allowing it to mount read-only and forcing
read-only mode when attempts to mount read-write are made. That way
the user never perceives a data loss situation and can take the
appropriate steps to repair the partitioning error.
