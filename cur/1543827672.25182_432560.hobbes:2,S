Great tool.
I ran ./go and after 16:50 hours, the tasks 9 and 10 ( type hrt ) jumped respectively to 9787
and 3843usec ! 5 or 10 minutes earlier I did have between 100 and 200 usec.
What can cause this problem ? is it a hrt problem ?
Could it be a driver problem ( network ) ?
I send the png in copy.
