No entry for your linux-kernel@VGER.RUTGERS.EDU address could be found in
the DOWNLOAD-DISPATCH  list at  DISPATCH.CNET.COM. Here  are a  number of
possible reasons why you might still be getting mail from the list:
1. You could be subscribed under a different, but equivalent address. For
instance, if  your e-mail address  as it appears  in the 'From:'  line of
messages coming from you has the  misfortune of depending on the distance
between your  workstation and the  terminal room door, you  were probably
subscribed from  a different  address and, while  your mail  system knows
that the two addresses are equivalent,  LISTSERV has no way to know that.
In this case the only thing you can do, beyond contacting the list owner,
is to  send a "REVIEW DOWNLOAD-DISPATCH"  command to find out  under what
address you are subscribed, and try to duplicate it with the help of your
user support people.
2. If you are a BITNET user,  you might be subscribed under your Internet
address and sending  this command via BITNET, or vice  versa. Most BITNET
sites  have  registered their  Internet  addresses  in the  BITNET  nodes
database, BITEARN NODES (the "tag"  containing this information is called
':internet' - if you do not understand  any of this, just bring a copy of
this message to your user support people). Unfortunately, some sites have
still not done that,  and in such cases LISTSERV has  no way to determine
that, for  instance, BITNET  node XYZCOL1  is the  same as  Internet host
VM3.XYZ.EDU. If  you suspect  this might be  your problem,  try resending
your request via both interactive message (SEND under VMS, TELL under VM)
and e-mail.
3. You  might be subscribed under  an equivalent yet different  address -
for  instance, one  with explicit  gatewaying, or  an X.400  address with
different  ordering of  the various  components,  etc. You  could send  a
"REVIEW  DOWNLOAD-DISPATCH" command  and inspect  the list  membership to
find out whether this is the case, and ask the list owners to remove that
address from the list.
4. You could be subscribed to  the list under another account, from which
mail      is     being      automatically      forwarded     to      your
linux-kernel@VGER.RUTGERS.EDU account. In that case you should be able to
leave  the list  by resending  the signoff  request from  the account  in
question.
5. You could be subscribed to the list indirectly, via a "redistribution"
list. That is, one  of the subscribers to the LISTSERV list  is in fact a
mailing  list, to  which  you  are yourself  subscribed  (note that  this
"sub-list"  is not  necessarily managed  by LISTSERV  and, in  fact, such
lists are often manually maintained, in  which case the only way to leave
the list is  to contact the person  who maintains it). Since  you are not
directly subscribed  to DOWNLOAD-DISPATCH, the  only way for you  to stop
getting the  postings is to  contact the administrators of  this sub-list
and ask them to sign you off.
You should be able to contact the  list owners by simply replying to this
message (if you  do not know how  to reply to a message  in your mailbox,
you        can         send        a        new         message        to
'DOWNLOAD-DISPATCH-request@DISPATCH.CNET.COM' instead).
