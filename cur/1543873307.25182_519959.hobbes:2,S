I would think that's a bad idea.  I expect future processors to do HT
much better than the P4 did.  There will always be cases where two
processes don't share well, but the majority of cases they probably will
share well.  Of course if you don't have enough processes to keep all
the CPU cores busy, you might as well not schedule something on the
siblings on HT processors, but on the other hand maybe you should if you
can power down other cpus completely to save power and still get all the
work done at maximum speed.
