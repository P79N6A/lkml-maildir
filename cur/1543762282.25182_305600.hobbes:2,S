In this moment I need to clean up the missing symbol. If anyone wants to 
remove the code using this, then he might post a patch explictly removing it, 
and getting it refused probably.
Or at least CC uml-devel when discussing those problems. I'm not currently 
able to find on marc.theaimsgroup.com the mail you talk about. Can you please 
provide the URL to the discussion? (even on any other archive you like, 
obviously).
That said, there are people still using that code, so it should be kept in.
Also, you blocked an important patch (the one adding ->release to 
hw_interrupt_type) saying that *perhaps* UML should avoid having any hard 
irq, a la S390. You forced so the merge of a very ugly patch manually calling 
what should have been UML's release method (i.e. free_irq_by_irq_and_dev) in 
every place calling free_irq() (and in fact one was missed at first). Might 
you reconsider your position on that issue ? (URL of the discussion below)

The patch adding the generic handling is this one:
