I'm running 2.6.0-test11 on a Dell Latitude D600 laptop and I'm having
some problems with the touchpad. For some reason, if I hit the touchpad
twice, the driver seems to generate a triple-click instead of a double
click. However, clicking on the actual button twice correctly generates
a double-click. I checked and 2.4 behaves correctly. Is that a bug or
did something just changed in the way the mouse is handled.
