Sharing irqs /sucks/.  I routinely have to fight a USB device dying, 
because the ATA device is causing an interrupt storm, or vice versa. 
/Very/ common headache.
Other than that, they use a tiny bit fewer CPU cycles, and allow 
simplification of the interrupt handler (saving another few CPU cycles).
The biggest benefit is (a) for hardware designers, where MSI means a 
cleaner h/w design, and (b) preparation of drivers and the kernel 
systems for MSI-only hardware.
At present only high end hardware is MSI-only (like infiniband), but 
that's the future direction.
