init/main.o: In function `start_kernel':
init/main.o(.text.init+0x622): undefined reference to `setup_per_cpu_areas'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1
Reason?
Patch alters main.c to:
#ifndef CONFIG_SMP
...do some stuff (not including setup_per_cpu_areas)
#else
	#ifdef __GENERIC_PER_CPU
		define    setup_per_cpu_areas that does something
	#else
		define 	 setup_per_cpu_areas that doesn't do anything
	#endif
#endif
setup_per_cpu_areas(); in start_kernel is called and comes out undefined for 
my single processor - Athlon XP 1600+
