You can either make a minimized configuration by hand, or you can use my 
shrinker script (which is slow, but can be left running in a background 
window).  I've attached the script.
For ARCH=um, you'd cd to your linux source directory that has the .config you 
want, and run it like:
  ARCH=um ./miniconfig.sh mini.conf
And it should produce a file "mini.conf" when it's done.  The progress 
indicator shows two numbers (111/222) which are the number of lines it's 
confirmed it needs to keep, and the total number of lines remaining in the 
file.  The one of the left counts up, the one on the right counts down, when 
they match, it's done.
Doing a better version of this in C as a patch to the kconfig infrastructure 
has been a todo item of mine for over two years. :(

UML supports modules?  Huh.  (Yeah, I suppose it does.  I've never used it.)
So the bug is "module support doesn't compile in UML 2.6.21" then.  Might want 
to change the title and resubmit. :)
