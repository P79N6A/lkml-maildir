Then we want to see it. I did the straightforward thing (almost the same
as Christoph Rohlands test snippet in another post).
Note that Gimp uses shm in at least 2 ways: the usual MIT-SHM dance (which
didn't break in 2.3.51), and for communication with its plug-ins (which did,
but only because its configure script had found the old Linux behaviour
to be "safe".) Reconfiguring/recompiling gimp cures it, and any other
program that depends on that old behaviour exploited an odd linuxism anyway.
