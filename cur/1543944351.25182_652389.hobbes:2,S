Hi Chris,
Some part of the patch is already in 2.6.25-rc1 -- please see commit 
a45d82d19a6c2a717bcc33cff243199b77fa0082, which adds support for Apple 
Aluminium keyboards. So the patch would need some changes that it would 
apply on top of current tree.
Also, if you could get Signed-off-by for the new patch from the author(s) 
of the original patch, that would be great.

Also, Tobias (added to CC) seems to be currently working on adding support 
for a subset of keyboards that this patch adds. Tobias -- it seems like 
this patch is handling a superset of what your patch does, right?
It would be great if you could put this all together into one condensated 
patch which I could merge into my tree.
Thanks guys!
