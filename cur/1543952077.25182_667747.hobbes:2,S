OK, then both pids have to be stored. audit_pid remains as-is but is
no longer used as destination netlink pid. A second pid is stored and
updated whenever a netlink message is received from userspace.

I don't understand this. As far as I can read the code, a plain kernel
side netlink socket is created in audit_init(). But it doesn't matter,
as soon as we receive the first message from userspace, we know the
netlink source pid.

Yes, exactly.
