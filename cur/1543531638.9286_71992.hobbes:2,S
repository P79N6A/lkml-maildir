Sorry, it never occured to me to post logs until now.  This error log
is actually running a kernel with my patch to make Linux think the
drive is bigger.  DMA Mode was enabled with hdparm -X66 -d1 /dev/hda,
which only works correctly if the BIOS actually enables DMA when it
detects the drive, so if I set the drive type to None to get it to
boot without cylinder limitations, I can't set DMA mode with the older
kernel (though it looks like I can with this patch).
One thing seems interesting about the log below.... why does it say
65530/15/61 ???  Linux thinks the logical geometry is 4982/255/63
(which is correct) but maybe the drive thinks it is 65531/16/63 (which
multiplies out to that magic 66055248 number.  I took a look at the
manual for Diamond hard-drives, and one command I noticed was the
initialize geometry command.  I know that this command shouldn't make
any difference in an LBA world, but maybe the drive needs you to set
the H=255 and S=63 with that command and that would enable it to see
the full capacity.  I have no idea though, I am throwing that out
(probably not gonna work).
You can use the drive you have there to test this behavior, just set
J46 (the middle jumper) and try reading past sector 66055248 and see
what happens.  If it works on your drive, then apparently running
JUMPON has basically screwed any chance of me using the drive with
Linux until Linux is updated.  If it doesn't work on your drive, then
I'll feel better but I'll still have to search for a way to make the
drive think it is the correct capacity.
BTW... anyone know of any tools to un-PKLITE the JUMPON .EXE and then
disassemble it?  Maybe there is some usefull information there.
