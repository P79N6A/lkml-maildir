Subject: Possible problem in 2.3.13 msg.h?

I'm not entirely sure about this, but it appears that the msg.h in 2.3.13
and .14 (and maybe other 2.3 kernels) might be broken.  In the "struct
msqid_ds" block, there are two lines that look like this:
        wait_queue_head_t wwait;
        wait_queue_head_t rwait;
I can't seem to compile anything that includes linux/msg.h.  It always
complains about the syntax at this point--something about a missing '}'
character.  So I replaced it with the corresponding lines from the 2.2
msg.h:
        struct wait_queue *wwait;
        struct wait_queue *rwait;
and it appears to work.
Will this work over the long term, or did I just break something?
