the only (small) overhead is associated to truly detached
(PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED) threads, but the more important usage is when a
thread is created and joined, with some status code passed along. And even
in the PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED case, most usages just never terminate the
thread. So the high-frequency thread creation/destruction always happens
via some sort of joining method.
