I did that last, almost automaticly, and got nothing, not even an 
invocation of ksysguard.  I think I should have.  However in another 
day or so I should have enough of kde-3.2-beta built to switch and 
see if that works.
However, this finally spit out something, but I don't know what to do 
about it:

--- SIGPIPE (Broken pipe) ---
[root@coyote usr]#
-------------------
I closed the ksysguard window, which made the broken pipe.
AFAIK, nscd is not running, and hasn't in years, I'm using a hosts 
file on this teeny network.
Also, changing it to look at opens, libsensors.so.1 failed, but it 
hasn't existed since lm_sensors-2.7.0 was fresh.  Thats at least 
collecting social security by now.  I have lots of libsensors.so.3's 
though :)
