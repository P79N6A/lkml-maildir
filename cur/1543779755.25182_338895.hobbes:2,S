Yeah, i.e. common case is $LSM and capabilities.  Stack slot is last
one, and gets put to use only if needed.

Why would you not request a static slot?

So, I guess this means you request one, but who knows which one you'll
get?

API change is no big deal.  Seems useful to get index value so you can
do optimized retrieve later.  But, I don't see it useful to request that
way.  Just register, get index, if index == last slot, lookup hits list.
