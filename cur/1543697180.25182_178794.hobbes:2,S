Subject: How can a loadable kernel module remove itself?

Say I've got a kernel module that decides its job is done, and it wants to 
unload itself automatically.  Is there any way to do that?  Basically I'm 
looking for the opposite of the request_module() function, except that 
I've already got a pointer to the module in question, i.e., THIS_MODULE.
Thanks,
Alan Stern
