having a sysctl can be an additional option (though it's tricky to
implement due the needed callbacks), but the problem I guess is that
most people needs a larger buf for the boot logs, so having only the
sysctl would be too late...

Note however that on the old 16M pentium it's unlikely that your boot
logs will overflow the current 64k, so for your pentium I doubt there
would be any need to use the feature. At least from my point of view the
feature is meant mainly for the high end, like 16/32-way HT with 64G of
ram etc.. where 64k hardly matters.

note the 64k are only wasted when you use the feature, there's nothing
wasted if you don't use it.
