You probably already know this...
Someone mentioned to me that 'make checkconfig' isn't working.
However, 'make checkincludes' does work.
'checkconfig' contains the string 'config', which implies to Makefile
that this is a configs-target...
Using a target named 'checkconf' works.   Patch is below.
Or fix it however you like, of course.
