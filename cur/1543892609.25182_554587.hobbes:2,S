Good point.  That is a big oversight.  Though I would prefer to handle
that in the same fs rather than fork.

This is nirvana.   But it is not the goal of the patches in question.
In fact there are several use cases that don't need and don't value
the writeability and don't need therefore the overhead.  It is a long
