Subject: [BK PATCH] PCI fixes for 2.6.0-test3
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hi,
Here are some tiny PCI patches against 2.6.0-test3.  They fix a bug with
code that shouldn't have gotten into setup-bus.c and allow pci drivers
to properly propagate their probe() errors up to the driver core (which
now reports them.)  I've also moved the pci_pretty_name() macro to pci.h
as two different archs already created the same macro for themselves,
and created the PCI_DEVICE() and PCI_DEVICE_CLASS() macro to make the
pci_device_id lists in drivers a lot simpler to use.
I also added two compile bug fixes for video drivers, but you already
beat me to them in your tree, so they merged away.
Please pull from:

thanks,
greg k-h
p.s. I'll send these as patches in response to this email to lkml for
those who want to see them.

  o PCI: testing for probe errors in pci-driver.c
Greg Kroah-Hartman:
  o PCI: added the pci_pretty_name() macro to pci.h as 2 arches already had it
  o FB: fix broken tridentfb.c driver due to device.name change
  o Video: fix broken saa7111.c driver due to i2c structure changes
  o PCI: add PCI_NAME_SIZE instead of using DEVICE_NAME_SIZE
  o PCI: remove #include <linux/miscdevice.h> from some pci hotplug drivers
  o PCI: add PCI_DEVICE_CLASS() macro to match PCI_DEVICE() macro
