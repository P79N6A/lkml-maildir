No. number() is an internal helper function. The base is correctly
set before number() is called. The reported bug had nothing at
all to do with the internal variable, base. Instead it had to
do with not allowing a leading "0x" for hexadecimal numbers
as the standard allows (or has been interpreted to allow).
This is simply fixed by inspection of the string variable before
a conversion is attempted.

Why is the government concerned about the lunatic fringe? Think about it.
