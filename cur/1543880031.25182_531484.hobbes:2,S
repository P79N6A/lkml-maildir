Subject: [PATCH] Fix UDP checksum issue in net poll mode.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

In net poll mode, the current checksum function doesn't consider the
kind of packet which is padded to reach a specific minimum length. I
believe that's the problem causing my test case failed. The following
patch fixed this issue.
