Good spotting. An equivalent fix is just in 2.2.15pre. I extracted
yesterday the interesting patch against 2.2.14 here:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/patches/v2.2/2.2.14/2.2.15pre6-block_dev-part.gz
The 2.3.x counterpart is still buggy since there are not yet my fs
corruption fixes merged.
I sent to Linus my blockdevice fixes (updated with the fix in 2.2.15pre)
so they should show up in 2.3.x soon. OTOH if we want to move the raw
blockdevice to page cache to allow mmap everything will gets dropped...
For now the 2.3.x fs corruption fix for the raw devices is here:
