This jives with our findings back when we first looked at this
(200%-300% speedups in most benchmarks), so this is excellent that it is
yielding boosts here as well.

Well, IIUC thats only true if the other task happens to preempt current,
which may not always be the case, right?  For instance, if current still
has timeslice left, etc.  I think the primary difference is actually the
reduction in the ctx switch rate, but its hard to say without looking at
detailed traces and more stats.  Either way, woohoo!
