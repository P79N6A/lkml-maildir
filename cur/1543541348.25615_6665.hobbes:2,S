Hmm.  You need a way of remotely shutting down the box.  Install
ssh on the machine, and block ssh access with ipchains so only a
certain machine or machines can ssh in.  Log in via ssh to
shutdown.
Alternatively, you could use some jumper in the machine to detect
an externally connected switch of some kind.  I can't think of an
exact example, but look on the motherboard, modem, or any other
hardware lying around for some IO port readable jumper.  It could
be the CTS line on a serial port, or anything at all.  Wire the
thing up to the turbo switch or something and write a short
program that monitors that switch and shuts down when it is
pressed.  Have the shutdown script play some musical "beep" or
something that is unique to let you know when it is shutdown and
safe to kill power.
