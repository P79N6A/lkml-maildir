OK, I understand that the ESS Solo1 driver is very experimental at the
moment, but since I've got a million of these things lying around, I'd
like to at least get the main stuff working.. I can load the solo1 module
alright, and sox & ESD sound, etc. work fine. But, the docs for the solo1
driver says that it's supposed to support opl3 FM synth. When I run
something that uses MIDI/FM synth (e.g. playmidi), it complains about
/dev/sequencer not being configured, and the kernel logs print a message
from modprobe that it "can't locate module synth0" Now, I never remember
there ever being a module named synth0, and the opl3 driver seemed to work
fine with my other sound cards.  Does the solo1 just not support the linux
drivers yet..?
