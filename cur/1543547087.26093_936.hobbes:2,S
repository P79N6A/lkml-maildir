Subject: 2.4.0-test7: umount + mount = same directory (CD)

The problem that I reported for -test6 is still here:
I have a mounted CD.  "ls -l /mount/point" shows its directory.
If I do umount /mount/point, replace CD with another one
and mount on the same point (I did not try different mount point),
"ls -l" shows the directory from the *first* CD.  If I try
to "mount" and empty tray, then insert a CD and mount it,
I see the directory of the new CD.
SMP x86, SCSI CDROM (Plextor) on ncr53x810.
