FYI, I have never written to Uwe regarding any sort of maintainership.
You seem to be quite up with an overdose of drugs
From 2005/09/13 - 2007/05/03 (till date) there have been 15 mails from
my side to Uwe, none of which has a topic whatsoever you say. Only the
first mail was a private mail and that is CC'd to Johannes as well.
Firstly you seem to play politics by getting Uwe to flame me, then when
it backfired, you are trying to play tricks with the rest of the
community as well, by spreading nonsense statements.
Great!
