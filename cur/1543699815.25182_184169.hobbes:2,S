I don't think that's a good assumption. There will be surely be some 
machine that has an mapping there. You will need to find some fool
proof way to detect the presence of PCI-Express. Otherwise it will likely
fail the number one criterium for merging ("it shall not break 
anything else")
And in general new development should be done in 2.6 first...
