The snapshot 2.6.5-bk1 is out, and has a _ton_ of changes in it that 
have been waiting to go upstream for several weeks.  This snapshot 
includes many more _major_ changes than most snapshots, so I wanted to 
call special attention to it, and request testing and feedback from 
linux-kernel denizens.
Changelog describing the 457 changes in this snapshot:
