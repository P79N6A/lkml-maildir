First why not use printk ? Second I don't think this approach is not
safe. Take a look at tty_io.c to see what is really involved to write to
tty. If you really want to write to a VT via the tty layer look at
respond_string in console.c. Note that is only for VTs. 
Q: Why did they deprecate a.out support in linux?
A: Because a nasty coff is bad for your elf.
