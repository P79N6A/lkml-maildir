Exactly.

Hmm. Are you sure that MediaOne was added to ORBS blacklist ? It's news to me.
Usually blocking ORBS lead to MAPS RBL blacklist, not ORBS blacklist (and it's
MUCH harder to pull out system out of MAPS RBL blacklist :-) So if now they are
adding systems in internal ORBS's blacklist it's RELAXATION of policy not
tightening. Anyway. ORBS does not do ANYTHING above try to send few LEGAL
strings to mailservers with LONG delays. So if you block ORBS you deserve
blocking :-)
