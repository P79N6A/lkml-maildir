I would like to retract yesterday's statement that is fixed. This
morning when I connected to news, the connections from the mail server
were reset in the same way again. Unfortunately I was running iptraf
not tcpdump, so while I could see that the connection was reset I do
not have a trace. Kernel 2.3.10 seems to have improved the situation
as the tests I did yesterday, after reading your mail, did not fail,
but (unless this was a different problem with similar symptoms) it has
not fixed it.
I tried to re-create the problem again, with tcpdump running, by
winding back the time I was sending in the NEWNEWS commands to nntp
(to try and generate a lot of initial traffic) but mail started coming
down normally. I will test it again in a few hours when enough mail
and news have accumulated to be make the test meaningful. Are there
any other diagnostics I should be taking?
