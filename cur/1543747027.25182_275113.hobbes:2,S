So what? 
It may not be ready for inclusion yet, how does that matter?
It is being worked on.  I see problems with a userspace implememtation,
the console have to be available - but a userspace console
can be killed.  By the never perfect OOM-killer, for example.

Why nicest?
Of course ruby isn't there right now - but is there a working
userspace console anywhere?

Interesting ideas and many good points there.  The console is 
only a small part of it though, it seems to be mostly 
2D/3D/framebuffer/drm problems.
A console is a small thing and separating it from the rest
is a good idea. I am not so sure putting it in userspace is
though.
