In the case where send_sigio is sending a signal to a specific
process, why isn't it using find_task_by_pid()?. For the other case,
I'm working on a more general solution to most of the for_each_task()
uses in the kernel.  I made a patch last year that adds fast
for_each_task_in_pgrp(), and for_each_task_in_session() macros.  I
have measurements that prove that the patch helps a lot for the
fork()+exit() case.  Please look at
http://www.guardian.no/~astor/pidhash/pidhash.gif
for a graph of this that I made for the patch for Linux 2.1.90.  It
shows that when you have a lot of processes running, doing a
fork()+exit() takes a long time.  This is due to for_each_task()'ing
in exit to send signals.  I'd guess that send_sigio() will perform
similar to the above graph.  
The general idea of the patch is to sort the entrires in the
task_list.  Primarily by session-id, secondary by process group, and
tertiary by pid.  In addition to that, we make sure that all pgids,
sids and pids are available in the pidhash-hash-table.  So to traverse
all tasks in a process group, you just look up that pgid in the
pidhash and traverse the task list until the pgid changes.  Likewise
with sids.
So the patch generally does the following:
  - When forking, insert the new process behind its parent instead of
    at the start/end of the task-list.
  - When changing pgid or sid, change position of the process in the
    task-list.
  - Make sure all kernel threads have pid==pgid==sid
  - For some special places that want to do a "signal each children", we have
    to traverse the whole task list if one of the children is ptraced so 
    we have a counter of the number of ptraced children of a process
    so we can optimize the common case.
I've started to port the patch to 2.2.8.
