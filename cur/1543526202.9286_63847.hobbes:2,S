Unfortunately Alan is right.  On my MIPS ISA boxes I've often seen the
i8259 interrupt 7 being triggered.  Some drivers actually will barf when
the interrupt handler is triggered while the device didn't.  You may also
checkout arch/ppc/kernel/i8259.c:i8259_irq() which has special treatment
for interrupt 7.
