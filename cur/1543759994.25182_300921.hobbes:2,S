At some cpu frequency point on i386 the main cause of your interrupt 
service latency will be in the interrupt controller and how long from irq 
assertion to the signal being recognised, resultant vector being 
dispatched to the processor and the necessary interrupt controller 
acknowledge steps required. This is also helped by the fact that the 
Linux/i386 interrupt vector stubs are very small and fast, so there isn't 
all that much code to execute to reach the ISR from the vector table. I'm 
not sure if you've tested this, but you may notice that timer interrupt 
via Local APIC will have lower dispatch latency than timer interrupt via 
i8259 only. But that's all at the lower end of the latency graph, you will 
most likely run into other sources on a busy system.
