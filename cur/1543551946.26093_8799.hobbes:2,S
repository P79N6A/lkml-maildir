Greetings:
  The subject says it. I'm getting the following errors when I try to
install the ide-scsi module:
# insmod ide-scsi
Using /lib/modules/2.4.0-test9/kernel/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.o
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test9/kernel/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.o: unresolved
symbol scsi_register_R85845d2f
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test9/kernel/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.o: unresolved
symbol scsi_unregister_module_Rf741008f
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test9/kernel/drivers/scsi/ide-scsi.o: unresolved
symbol scsi_register_module_Rfa20b7b0
  Can anyone help me ? My CD-RW is dead until I can install this module.
Any & all help will be vastly appreciated. Please respond via email as
well as to the list/newsgroups, thank you. Let me know what other
information may be required to debug this problem.
  PS: How do I sign up to get on the linux-kernel list ?
Best regards,
