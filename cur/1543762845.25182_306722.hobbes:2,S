Here's something a little better than pseudocode but not as good as a 
patch... :-)
Consider adding to struct klist two new fields:
	int	k_offset_to_containers_kref;
	void	(*k_containers_kref_release)(struct kref *);
To fill the first field in correctly requires that klist creation use a
macro; the details are unimportant.  What is important is that during
klist_node_init you add:
	struct kref *containers_kref = (struct kref *) ((void *) n +
			k->k_offset_to_containers_kref);
	kref_get(containers_kref);
and in klist_release you add:
	struct kref *containers_kref = (struct kref *) ((void *) n +
			n->n_klist->k_offset_to_containers_kref);
	kref_put(containers_kref, n->n_klist->k_containers_kref_release);
(Actually this conflicts with my earlier suggestion about removing 
n->n_klist.  Oh well... nothing's perfect.)
In fact the kref_put() should take the place of the call to complete().  
This scheme assumes that the container object does contain a kref, but 
this is true for all the containers in the driver model.

There's no need for the flag to be atomic, since it's only altered while 
the klist's lock is held.

It's not that you get into trouble; it's that you're forced to wait for 
klist_node.n_removed when you shouldn't have to.  To put it another way, 
one of the big advantages of the refcounting approach is that it allows 
you to avoid blocking on deallocations -- the deallocation happens 
automatically when the last reference is dropped.  Your code loses this 
advantage; it's not the refcounting way.
If you replace the struct completion with the offset to the container's
kref and make the klist_node hold a reference to its container, as
described above, then this unpleasantness can go away.
