If we had a large moderators group, we could do mail processing within minutes.
I'm not familiar with any mail list systems, is the mail validation
done with a web-interface?
If we could get incoming traffic delivered to the moderator's mailbox,
rather than appear on the web interface, it would be not hard for him
to ack/nack certain e-mails. We could even get the traffic split
betweem moderators, e.g. one gets N e-mails, afters processing them,
he gets an other N e-mails, and if he does not process theese e-mails
within M hours, they are sent to an other moderator. But here it's
only my imagination, maybe people with some mailing list
administration experience could give more ideas. And yes, if the
moderators group is large enough, I'm ready to come in.
