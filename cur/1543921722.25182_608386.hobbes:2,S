Same issues with level 2 and 1.
BTW I found out why my box does not shutdown with acpi=ht. It seems like libata does not like that 
acpi mode =) dropping the '... read 
http://linux-ata.org/shutdown.html
 , power down manually' message.
That works perfectly with full acpi here.
After all I think all this problems may be some who ACPI related 
but the question is why they get triggered by Suspend/Hibernation.
If you want me to test something else just let me know.
