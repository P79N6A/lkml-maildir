No, but I got interestring results.

"OK" means NULL pointer dereference didn't happen.
"BUG" means NULL pointer dereference happened.
I was adding "noapic" "nolapic" to command line while assigning 2 vcpus.
Thus, I encountered this problem. Workaround is to remove "noapic" "nolapic".
Now, it seems to me that this problem is caused by interaction of
"noapic" "nolapic" "maxcpus=0" "nosmp" options.
Regards.
