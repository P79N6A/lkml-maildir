Ifconfig isn't really at fault.  When it asks the kernel to set the
address, the kernel guesses a netmask on the basis of the IP address
(class B in this case) and chooses a broadcast address accordingly.
Ifconfig then changes the netmask to what you specified but this
doesn't automatically affect the broadcast address.
If you add `broadcast xx.xx.xx.xx' to your ifconfig command line the
right thing will happen.  I guess it would be possible to make
ifconfig a bit smarter so that it spotted this situation and overrode
the kernel's guess at the broadcast address, but I'm not sure if it's
particularly desirable.
