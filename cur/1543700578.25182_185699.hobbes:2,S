Oh, forgot to mention that udev runs a _lot_ slower now, taking at least
1 second for every device addition.  This makes the initscript or the
test scripts take a long time.
This was done to try to fix the race condition where udev beats the
kernel before it has created all of the sysfs links and files.  I need
some libsysfs changes before this can be done properly, without the big
speed hit (the libsysfs people are working on it.)
If anyone's interested in it, take a look at the FIXMEs in namedev.c.
I tried messing around with just a simple stat() call, but still
couldn't reliably get stuff to work for partitions on usb-storage
devices (which are slow to enumerate.)  Any help here would be
apprecated.
thanks,
greg k-h
