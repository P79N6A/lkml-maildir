Perhaps only part of the change should be backed out.  The part that masks
the irq in the handle_simple_irq code.
That's from commit 76d2160147f43f982dfe881404cfde9fd0a9da21 which is to
not disable an irq line when disable_irq is called.  A form of lazy
disable irq.
This speeds up code that uses disable_irq, since the line is only masked
when an interrupt actually arrives. Using disable_irq / enable_irq does no
IRQ chip modifications if an interrupt from the IRQ line does not arrive
between the two.
Now the question is, can something that uses handle_simple_irq call
disable_irq?  If there is no mask function, I would assume that this would
be a noop in such a case. If this is true, then we could remove the mask
from handle_simple_irq. But then we might want to add a BUG() in
disable_irq for simple_irqs.
