Supposedly they did, in the advertising clause, but the Regents of the
University of California relicensed all of their code such that you can
ignore the advertising clause.
(see 
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html
 and
ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change
)
No one has ever sued over it, AFAIK.
Also the GPL says:
# These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
# identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
# and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
# themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
# sections when you distribute them as separate works.
Which means we could still distribute them as seperately, should a legal
challenge come up.

It was only a theoretical problem before, now its not even that.
