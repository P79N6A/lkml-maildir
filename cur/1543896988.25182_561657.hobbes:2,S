Yes, it should first be shown (with subsystem conversions and runtime
tests with, say, at least two different bus architectures) that features
like this really are appropriately implemented as a driver core abstraction.
I would lend a hand to put this to test, but I won't do this anymore
with the old ieee1394 subsystem, and work on the new firewire subsystem
will be focused on stabilization and feature completion in the short to
mid term.
