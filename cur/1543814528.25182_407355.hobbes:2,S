hm.  Is that a superset of ->nopage?  Should we be looking at
migrating over to ->nopfn, retire ->nopage?

Maybe not...

That would probably be best.

ia64 uses strcmp() in hotpaths to work out what sort of platform it's
running on?  Surely someone has cached this info in a __read_mostly integer
somewhere?

This function has no callers.

You don't know that fetchop_miscdev was registered.
