Calin,
I think the proper place for this query is the Mandrake Expert mailing 
list, which can be subscribed to at expert@linux-mandrake.com.
Mandrake has been around for several years and I've used their distribution 
(and often their kernels) since Mandrake 7.0.  I think it's incorrect to 
blame their "newness".
What gcc are you running?  gcc-3.0.4 has worked fine for me in building 
2.4.18 kernels on 8.2.
