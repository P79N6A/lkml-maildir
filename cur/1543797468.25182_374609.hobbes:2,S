That would be nice, but we need multiple, contiguous huge pages.  
Actually, about 768M worth. Yeah, I guess I'll stipulate that what  
we're doing is pretty crazy, but it works well. I figure if I can  
call alloc_huge_page, I should be able to remap such a page.  
Actually, I would prefer an explicit remap call for this purpose, but  
in doing my own I found that I needed precisely the code that was  
already in make_huge_pte.
I don't have any strong feeling about whether this is accepted or  
not. I just thought that I should share a change that might be useful  
to others.
