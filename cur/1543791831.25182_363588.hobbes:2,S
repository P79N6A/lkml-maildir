As mentioned at the kernel summit, we're working on it
at the CE Linux Forum.  These things take time to set up,
but we have code already for something that tests
the size impact of individual kernel configs, and we're
working on a test to track individual function sizes for
each new kernel (using Andi Kleen's bloat-o-meter).
We're still in process of setting up the test lab,
but we have a number of hardware boards already,
and we're hoping to be publishing size regression data
for the kernel on a regular basis, starting in about
April of next year.
