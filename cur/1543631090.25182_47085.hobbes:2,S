   I tried to make the interface fairly generic, so that people could easily
   do any (or none, like on x86) of these optimizations with little or no
   overhead.
It still needs to handle the "unmapping entire address space"
vs. "unmapping munmap-like operation".  Currently we'll flush
excessively when doing exit_mmap().
I'll go and hack this into your new stuff.
I guess you didn't read my emails from today for some reason,
I explained all of this.
