Sorry to bother, 
but what is the maximum amount of RAM that a *single* (!) process can
address under a Kernel version 2.6.13-15.7-smp, with 
CONFIG_HIGHMEM64G=y
CONFIG_HIGHMEM=y
CONFIG_X86_PAE=y
It seems that I can not get over 3 Gig border, but i need to, to solve
my numerical problems :(.
Greetings Kai
