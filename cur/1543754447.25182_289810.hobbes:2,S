the idea is:
1) the sooner we drop reservation, the higher probability to cover many
   changes by single transaction
1) having h_buffer_credits being decremented for each modification
   could help us to debug handle overflow situations
 SCT> If we do that, do we in fact need t_reserved at all?
hmm. if t_outstanding_credits holds number of modified buffers,
then we need sum of all running h_buffer_credits to protect
from transaction overflow. t_reserved is sum of h_buffer_credits.
thanks, Alex
