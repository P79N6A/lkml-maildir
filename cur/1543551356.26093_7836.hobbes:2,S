With ix86 processors in the kernel, you can create multiple segments
and multiple page-tables. If you have some 'hardware-specific' way
of mapping in real RAM that is not used by anybody else, you can have
your own private segment. Page registers can map in multiple sticks
of RAM into a single window. The page-fault handler can manipulate
the page registers for user-mode code. It's being done in PAE.
