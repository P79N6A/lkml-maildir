Cross compile mode.  Nothing in modutils works unless it is running on
the machine it was compiled for.  As more modutil functions get pushed
back into kbuild time, this is getting to be a problem.  I could do all
my own code for endianess and size differences between host and target,
but why bother when bfd already does it for me?
