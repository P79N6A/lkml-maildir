Hi Steve,
  The following patch to stock linux-2.2.10 fixes the problem for
me. Please try it out... If it works out OK, perhaps Alan could apply
it to the 'ac' series too?
  Sorry I didn't reply earlier, but I'm off on holiday this
week. I just quickly popped in to the office to read my mails today...
Cheers,
  Trond
