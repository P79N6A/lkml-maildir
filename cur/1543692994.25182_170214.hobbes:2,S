Hi,
I am testing the 2.6.0-test6 and I noticed that my floppy driver is
working constantly.
More details:
I have compiled the floppy driver as a module:
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_FD=m
I noticed that the floppy drive was constantly on and when a disk was in
it was acting as it was reading (but no request to do so was sent).
Then I noticed that the module was not loaded, so I did a "modprobe
floppy" and instantly the floppy driver shot down and act normally...
I guess that this problem has been already reported, but I didn't manage
to find it in the mailing-list archive, so I am submitting it in doubt.
Here is my lspci:
