With all of the latest VM, again the question is asked...  Best way to
set up swap now..
For 2 GIG memory...
Channel 0 is RAID 1 SCSI
Channel 2 is RAID 1+0 SCSI
Hardware Raid
Shoudl it be?
2 GIG swap partition (Is this still the limit?)
Dual 2 GIG swaps on seperate channels?
Dual 2 GIG swap files on same channel?
(Assuming that the channel is different than the channel using the bulk
of I/O)
