| Can't see what an IDE chip-set has to do with it. The RTC can only
| be accessed as an offset-location and a data-location. You write
| an offset at one location and you read/write data at another location.

| they are adjacent dword-wide memory locations.
IDE is just 1 of about 20 functional units in those chipsets.
The chipset specs say that there are some other RTC registers there
(total of 8).
Reducing the RTC I/O space from 16 to 8 bytes looks right to me,
even on x86.
