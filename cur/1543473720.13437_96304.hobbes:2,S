   It seems that the Cyrix chips do not do "rdtsc", even when they call
   themselves 686's. 
   We may need to have a special case for chips without "rdtsc".
Or simply use a run-time check for rdtsc (this example is from the
/dev/random driver):
        if (boot_cpu_data.x86_capability & X86_FEATURE_TSC) {
                __u32 high;
                __asm__(".byte 0x0f,0x31"
                        :"=a" (time), "=d" (high));
	...
Now, if the Cyrix chips are pulling a Clinton and saying that they have
rdtsc without actually having one, then obviously this won't
work.... (but then, they don't deserve to be supported, so...)
