X wasn't executing any commands anymore, so I switched over to a text console
and dmesg only showed this one oops after the bootup stuff. Your guess that
there might be memory corruption somewhere is probably not too far off, because
I occasionally have a broken ld-cache, in which case several programs suddenly
stop working. Running "ldconfig" immediately fixes that problem.
Whether it's VM-related or broken ram I cannot say, although I'd bet that
it's the former.
