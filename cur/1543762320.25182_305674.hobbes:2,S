Think of the following situation:
	- driver is bound to device.
	- userspace opens char dev node.
	- device is removed from the system (using fakephp I can do this
	  to _any_ pci device, even if it is on the motherboard.)
	- userspace writes to char dev node
	- driver attempts to access pci device structure that is no
	  longer present in memory.
Because of this open needs to get a reference to the pci device to
prevent oopses, or the driver needs to be aware of "device is now gone"
in some other manner.
