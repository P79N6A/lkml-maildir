Yep.  Right now 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 appear to be compatible. 2.2.2pre1 likewise.
2.2.1ac* isnt for stuff that directly hits current->file things (unusual)
but the other thing big file arrays needed that affects struct file is
already in linus tree (32 bit use counts - since you can open a file 100,000
times now)

Yes. We also have to find the right boundary between never changing (the MSDOS
stagnation/windows liability and effective death over time, sun 18month bug
fix) and excessive changes.
I wouldnt deny any of that.
