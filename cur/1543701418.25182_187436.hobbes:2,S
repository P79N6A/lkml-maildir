This is obviously due to can_request_irq is found in arch/i386/kernel/irq.c
and the x86_64 build just includes some stuff from arch/i386/pci/irq.c where
can_request_irq is used too. 
Linus introduced this function a few weeks ago. I used the patch below to move 
the function from kernel/irq.c to pci/irq.c, but he will probably fix it
himself soon.
Btw. there are a lot of other fixes for the x86_64 build from Andi Kleen which
you should apply too. However, they don't apply cleanly anymore.
