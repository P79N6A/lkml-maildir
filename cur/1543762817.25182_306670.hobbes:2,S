I've split them into two replies to reflect their nature of separateness.

Those are good suggestions. Thanks.

It's important when removing a containing object's knode from the list
when that object is about to be freed. This happens during both device and
driver unregistration. In most cases, the removal operation will return
immediately. When it doesn't, it means another thread is using that
particular knode, which means its imperative that the containing object
not be freed.
Do you have suggestions about an alternative (with code)?

It's trivial to add a helper that holds a lock across an entire iteration.
However, we currently don't separate the bus->match() and the
driver->probe()  operations. We must not hold a spinlock across ->probe(),
which means we drop the lock before both ->match() and ->probe(). However,
it might be interesting to split those up and do a locked iteration just
to find a match, grab a reference for the driver, break out of the
iteration, and call ->probe().

Good point. It's trivial to add an atomic flag (.n_attached) which is
checked during an iteration. This can also be used for the
klist_node_attached() function that I posted a few days ago (and you may
have missed).

It's assumed that the controlling subsystem will handle lifetime-based
reference counting for the containing objects. If you can point me to a
potential usage where this assumption would get us into trouble, I'd be
interested in trying to work arond this.
