I discovered the hard way that strstr() was broken in pre8, so I
suppose my LS-120 drive will work again with pre9, but I still think
this bit of code in ide-probe.c is wrong:
switch (type) {
        case ide_floppy:
                if (!strstr(id->model, "CD-ROM")) {
                        if (!strstr(id->model, "oppy") &&
!strstr(id->model, "poyp") && !strstr(id->model, "ZIP"))
                                printk("cdrom or floppy?, assuming ");
                        if (drive->media != ide_cdrom) {
                                printk ("FLOPPY");
                                break;
                        }
                }
                type = ide_cdrom;       /* Early cdrom models used zero
*/
        case ide_cdrom:
Suppose drive->media is equal to ide_cdrom.
Suppose id->model contains none of the substrings mentioned.
Then the code prints "... assuming " and sets the type to ide_cdrom.
Now suppose id->model contains "oppy" but none of the other substrings.
Then the code DOESN'T print "... assuming ", but it STILL sets the type
to ide_cdrom.
This doesn't make sense!
Here is what I suspect was intended:
switch (type) {
        case ide_floppy:
                if (strstr(id->model, "CD-ROM")) goto cdrom;
                if (!strstr(id->model, "oppy") && !strstr(id->model,
"poyp") && !strstr(id->model, "ZIP")) {
                        printk("cdrom or floppy?, assuming ");
                        if (drive->media == ide_cdrom) goto cdrom;
                }
                printk ("FLOPPY");
                break;
        cdrom:
                type = ide_cdrom;       /* Early cdrom models used zero
*/
        case ide_cdrom:
