Hi Falk,
       I had tried ipchains..
But What i am triying is I look the SRC IP address of
the incomming paket and depending upon whether it is
odd or even,I decide to accept it or reject it.
Now I did not find a way to specify such a rule in
ipchains. So I went with implementing it in the
kernel.
Is there a way u know of specifying this in ipchains.
I would appreciate Your suggestions
