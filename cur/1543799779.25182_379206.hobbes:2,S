Yes, indeed. Now, I used your idea and the patch became simpler. Thanks.

Sorry. My previous explanation is confusing. It's a link warning on ia64. On ia64, the kernel vmlinux doesn't include section .exit.text, so ld will report a link warning when a function is in section .exit.text and another function (not in .exit.text) calls the first one. When CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=n, function topology_remove_dev is in section .exit.text, but its caller topology_remove_dev is not in .exit.text.
i386 and x86_64 kernel vmlinux does include .exit.text and discard it only when running, so there is no such warning on i386/x86_64.
There is no other better approach to get rid of the warning unless we change arch/ia64/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S to keep all .exit.text in kernel image.
