It is failing on the very first submiturb call, getting -ENOENT back:
open("/dev/bus/usb/004/002", O_RDWR)    = 3
ioctl(3, USBDEVFS_GETDRIVER, 0x7fff5d0486b0) = -1 ENODATA (No data available)
ioctl(3, USBDEVFS_CLAIMINTERFACE, 0x7fff5d0487bc) = 0
ioctl(3, USBDEVFS_CLEAR_HALT, 0x7fff5d0487c4) = 0
ioctl(3, USBDEVFS_SUBMITURB, 0x7fff5d0486c0) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
