How long a time would that be a matter of?  I've been using two
ST3160827AS drives (firmware 3.00 and 3.03) connected to an SiI3114
controller using the libata driver (kernel 2.6.9) for a few weeks, at
full speed, without noticing anything out of the ordinary.  I can't
say I have any heavy load, but I have done some moving around of huge
files, and the usual compilation jobs.
The drives are both new.  Is there a chance Seagate have fixed the
problems?
