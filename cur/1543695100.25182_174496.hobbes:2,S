It's not a performance bug, fer crissakes!! Do you suggest disabling
write back cache on all ide drives? People will scream bloody murder if
we do. So it's a question of data integrity.

That needs something to hold the state in, and a bio per device. As
they complete, mark them as such. When they all have completed, barrier
is done.
That's just an idea, I'm sure there are other ways. Depending on how
complex it gets, it might not be a bad idea to just let the queues drain
though. I think I'd prefer that approach.
