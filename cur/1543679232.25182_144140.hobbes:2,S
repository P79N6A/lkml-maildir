Subject: [patch] 2.5.73-mm2: let CONFIG_TC35815 depend on CONFIG_TOSHIBA_JMR3927

The following problem seems to come from Linus' tree:
I got an error at the final linking with CONFIG_TC35815 enabled since
the variables tc_readl and tc_writel are not available.
The only place where they are defined is arch/mips/pci/ops-jmr3927.c, so 
I assume the following was intended:
--- linux-2.5.73-mm2/drivers/net/Kconfig.old	2003-06-28 11:14:16.000000000 +0200
+++ linux-2.5.73-mm2/drivers/net/Kconfig	2003-06-29 20:55:16.000000000 +0200
