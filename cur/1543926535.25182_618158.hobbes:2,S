Yes and no.  Adding just a data field -- void*, or maybe unsigned long
long so it's big enought to accommodate big timestamps -- would be a big
improvement on your current proposal.  That would save the user the
drudgery of mapping the ri pointer to his/her per-instance data.
There's plenty of precedent for passing "private_data" values to
callbacks.
I don't think a len field would help much.  If such info were needed, it
could be stored in the data structure pointed to by the data field.
I still don't think "letting [i.e., requiring that] user handlers do the
allocation" is a win.  I'm still interested to see how this plays out in
real examples.

I haven't been able to think of any scenarios where this would be
useful.  A "data pouch" could always contain a union, FWIW.
