The main features of 2.2.14aa1 are:
o	Support for 4Gigabyte of RAM on IA32 (me and Gerhard Wichert)
o	Support for 2048Gigabyte of RAM on alpha (stock 2.2.14 alpha
	limit is of 2Giga of RAM) (me)
o	Improved VM for high end machines with enough ram and doing
	heavy I/O under high memory pressure. (me)
o	RAW-IO (also on bigmem). (Stephen C. Tweedie)
o	sensitive SMP scheduler improvements. (me)
Detailed description of 2.2.14aa1:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
SMP-scheduler-2.2.11-E.gz       -> rewrote of reschedule_idle. (me)
alpha-imb-1.gz			-> alpha have an icache not coherent
				   with the dcache and it can be
				   also a virtually tagged and
				   virtually indexed cache thus
				   imb is necessary in some place
				   to avoid crashes for example
				   while insmodding modules. (me)
java-proc.gz                    -> revertd the semantic change that
                                   make difference between
                                   /proc/00000$$ and /proc/$$, this
                                   allows backwards compatibilty of
                                   a misfeature and it _won't_ hurt
                                   security. There's no downside
                                   in reverting the 2.2.13 semantic
                                   change.
kupdate-sigstop-2.2.11-1.gz     -> allows kupdate to be stopped via
                                   SIGSTOP (currently it must be stopped
                                   by setting interval to zero via
                                   sysctl). (me)
no-swapout-2.2.10-B.gz          -> avoid swapin/swapouts during heavy
                                   I/O (strictly necessary for decent
                                   performances on very I/O and MM loaded
                                   servers). (me)
probe-irq-2.3.14-pre2-1.gz      -> avoid a pending irq to be mistaken
                                   for a spurious irq. (me)
rtclight-2.2.14-1.gz		-> necessary for Alpha SMP.
shrink_all_cache-2.2.10-A.gz    -> make sure that big memory boxes will
                                   shrink the cache well enough. (me)
trashing-mem-2.2.10-A.gz        -> heuristic to penalize memory hogs,
                                   the system will remains responsive
                                   also during heavy swapout. (me)
z-bigmem-2.2.14aa1-7.gz		-> bigmem production code (IA32 and
				   alpha). (me and Gerhard Wichert)
z-bigmem-rawio-2.2.14aa1.gz	-> SCT's rawio bigmem capable. (Stephen C.
                                   Tweedie)

As usual all the separate patches are in:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.14aa1/
and they can be applyed in order to generate the 2.2.14aa1 kernel.
This time I also provided a whole diff, so if you don't want to bother to
download all single patches you can simply download this patch against
2.2.14:
	
ftp://ftp
.*.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/andrea/kernels/v2.2/2.2.14aa1.gz
and apply it to go in sync with 2.2.14aa1.

PS. If you'll run with more than 4giga of RAM on alpha, you'll need also
to fix procps if you want to read the correct MM values with `free`, `top`
and `vmstat`. procps takes all the memory information with byte
granularity in `int` words (and not long words). I fixed procps this way:
