Boy, there's just not a lot between 2.6.23-rc9 and 2.6.23 proper.
There are two things that kinda pop out, but this is at best a WAG.
First, are you on x86-32 and happen to have CONFIG_HIGHPTE set?
Second is another memory thing, where in filemap_fault we now do a
page_cache_release where we didn't before, but that appears to only be
in a case where we send a sigbus, so I wouldn't expect that to be
hitting.
Everything else looks to be for uncommon hardware or relatively safe
(such as a few networking changes).
I'll hunt around for the other reports.
