Those are PROT_NONE mapping.  As x86-64 has far bigger ELF page size
than the actual hardware page size commonly used ATM, there is usually
a gap between read-only/execute and read-write ELF segments.
It is undesirable to map anything in there (e.g. exception handling
would be very upset if you mapped a really small shared library in the
hole inside of another shared library) and PROT_NONE mapping prevents that.
If you strace some small process, you'll see that creating them is at most
as expensive as would be unmapping the regions.
