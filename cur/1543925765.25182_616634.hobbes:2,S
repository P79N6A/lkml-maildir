Nice.  Just what the world needs.  I wonder what the heck that format
means.  Obviously the "corrupt" check is wrong as a "\ No newline" line
is valid not corrupt.  Now when is "\ No newline" a good thing and when
a bad thing.  It _looks_ like it is 'bound' to the line before, and if
so then its pretty simple.
