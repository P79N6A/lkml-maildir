Hi All,
 I just downloaded the new 2.6.16 (very exciting!), and noticed something
odd in my menuconfig.  I was updating from a 2.4.15.4 config, when I noticed
that under cryptographic options I now have two AES entries...  I double
checked, and this occurs whether I use make oldconfig or make menuconfig on
the .15 file:
x x --- Cryptographic API
x x
...
  x x < >   AES cipher algorithms
x x
  x x < >   AES cipher algorithms (i586)
x x
...
  x x     Hardware crypto devices  --->       
Both entries have identical descriptions, yet one has the symbol
CRYPTO_AES_586 and (the new one) is just CRYPTO_AES.  I have no way of
knowing if this is intentional or a bug, but if it's the former it would
seem it deserves a different help text so folks like me know which to
choose.
