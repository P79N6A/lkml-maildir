Yes, I think you're right.  I gave the old use of dumpable the benefit of
the doubt as being needed for synchronization, but that would be enough too.

You're right again here.  I'm sure the old use predates this checking in
zap_threads, so it's understandable that something different was needed for
this synchronization before.

I concur.  It merits a comment at the coredump_wait call that this takes
care of all synchronization issues including races to enter do_coredump.
Thanks,
