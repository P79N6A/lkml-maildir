After posting the above, I thought maybe I'd hit a target in the middle 
and build a 2.6.20.2, with your -0.30 patch, but...
I'm going to have to build a 2.6.20.2, because with the rdsl-0.30 patch, 
its going to do a level 2 on my /usr/movies directory, which hasn't been 
touched in 90 days and has about 8.1GB in it according to du, and its 
going to do nearly all of it.  It shouldn't be anything but a directory 
listing file. But this is what amstatus is reporting:
coyote:/usr/movies            2     7271m dumping      793m ( 10.91%) 
(7:26:00)
And its also reporting far more data than exists it seems. As is du, 
for /var, which might have 2 gigs, its claiming 3.7!
Honest folks, I'm not smoking anything, I quit 18 years ago.  Back to bed 
while this one bombs out too.
