The switchroot in the initrd can't find the ext3 root fs.  So no root
found and bash couldn't be found.  This is the third bisect.  All of this
is because of a compiler warning in ext3 and reiserfs.  If I recall
correctly, something like "generic_slice_[...](?) uninitialized".

While ssh retains a connection on a good kernel.  It gets no response
from a bad kernel.
