  As was pointed out to me, old floppies don't generate the information
in all cases, nor do some drives for laptop use. But the suggestion was
made that once we get the status for media changed that we can (only)
then flag the status as trusted and not flush the cache on final close.
Unless you boot the system with the floppy inserted I would expect
inserting the first media to set this if the system is trustworthy.
  Drives which don't always work, and cables which are so marginal that
they work or not depending on temperature or vibration could happily be
ignored IMHO, flakey hardware is not deserving of such care, as opposed
to hardware which misbehaves in a predictable way.

  His first management concern is not solving the problem, but covering
his ass. If he lived in the middle ages he'd wear his codpiece backward.
