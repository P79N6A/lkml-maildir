Yup, which normally (using the product id etc) works out that it needs
to run "the script for my usb modem".

It was run by the hotplug system - it uploads firmware then launches the
internet connection.  The hotplug script knows to run it by looking up the
vendor/product id in a list.  Doesn't info get passed to the hotplut script via
environment variables?  Maybe they are not getting set up right...
I'm leaving now for one month so I'm afraid it will be a while until I'll
next be able to look at this...
Ciao,
