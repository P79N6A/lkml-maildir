What's an API for modules?
- whether a .h file is present under include/
- every EXPORT_SYMBOL{,_GPL}'ed function
- every inlined function under include/
- every struct defined under include/
- perhaps more things I'm currently forgetting
Every change to something mentioned above during a development kernel 
needs to be cover by an appropriate API versioning.
And then consider as an example cases like a function returning 
irqreturn_t in 2.6:
- in 2.6, this function returns irqreturn_t (typedef'd to int)
- in 2.4, this function might return irqreturn_t (typedef'd to void)
- in 2.4, this function might return void
I'm sure there is a correct solution for such cases - but it's extra
work and easy to get things wrong.
Why do you dislike autoconf? I do not pretend autoconf where perfect -
but it works. Looking at the external ALSA, autoconf seems to be a good 
solution to probe for exact the things a module needs without a big 
overhead in kernel development.
