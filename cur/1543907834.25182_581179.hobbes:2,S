Memoryless node support is work in progress currently in mm. You may 
encounter strange NUMA issues if you try to run a memoryless node right 
now.

The boot output shows:
Zone PFN ranges:
  DMA             0 ->    12288
  Normal      12288 ->    12288
early_node_map[2] active PFN ranges
    0:        0 ->     2560
    1:    12287 ->    12288
Remove the page and you should be fine.
