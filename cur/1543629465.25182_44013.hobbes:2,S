Ed, this is Linux and open source.   It is where it is today because of
cooperation,  contribution and generous understanding.
People contribute what they can, and they're not necessarily
getting paid to do so.  If its valuable to others, it gets
used.  The way I see it, getting anything at all is a bonus.
Additionally, not all  developers who contribute to Linux live in the US
and speak English.  I'm guessing that documentation in Russian or
Marathi wouldn't be much use to you..
Just something to think about..
thanks,
Nivedita
