Hmm, the correct way would be to switch off the master control in there,
afaics. Fixing it only in spu_run_init would mean that we also handle
the case of spu_reacquire_runnable along with it.

That looks right, there is no problem to have master control enabled,
as long as user space can't access the spu through a context that is
bound to it.

While this sounds wrong. Maybe the runcntl is active on those that have
_not_ run since boot, which would make more sense. We should investigate
this.

Right, the context save code needs to enable master control in order to
run on the spu. However, that should be after all mappings to user space
have been discarded.
