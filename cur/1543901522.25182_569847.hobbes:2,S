The other system with the Maxtor disk fails in a slightly different way 
(it correctly returns the c2 byte but not in the correct location):
[  162.896173] ata_qc_complete before: 00 00 00 40
[  162.896179] ata_qc_complete 16: 00 c2 00 50
My earlier 'git bisect' suggested that this problem surfaced after the 
patch
1e999736cafdffc374f22eed37b291129ef82e4e is first bad commit

    libata: HPA support
I have now done some further tests to see what is happening. 
It turned out that after commenting the call (at line 1956 in 
drivers/ata/libata-core.c in 2.6.22)
                        if (ata_id_hpa_enabled(dev->id))
                           dev->n_sectors = ata_hpa_resize(dev);
'smartctl -H' worked again without problems. This applied to both of the 
systems where I see the problem. The disks in both systems support hpa but 
nothing is hidden. Next I commented only the call to 
ata_read_native_max_address_ext() in ata_hpa_resize(). This was enough 
to remove the problem (as was expected).
So, the question is: why does calling ata_read_native_max_address_ext() 
when booting the system cause the SMART RETURN STATUS fail much later?
