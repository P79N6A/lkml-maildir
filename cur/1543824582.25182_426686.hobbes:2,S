Subject: swsusp in 2.6.16: works fine w/o PSE on a VIA C3?

I was just feeling lucky and tried suspend-to-disk cycle
on my VIA C3 machine, which lacks PSE which is marked as
being required for swsusp to work.  After commenting out
the PSE check in include/asm-i386/suspend.h and rebooting,
I tried the whole cycle, several times, with real load
(while running 3 kernel compile in parallel) and while
IDLE... And surprizingly, it all worked flawlessly for
me, without a single glitch...
So the question is: is PSE really needed nowadays?
Ok, "w/o a single glitch"...  Actually there are several
of them so far, but I guess they're unrelated to PSE/C3:
 o Suspend after clean boot is sloooow, it takes quite
   alot of time to write all the stuff to the disk (the
   percents are increasing by 1..2 in a sec).  After
   resume, if I suspend again the whole process takes
   only several secs.
 o There's a single 'failed' message, while *suspending*:
Stopping tasks: ===============================================|

pnp: Device 00:09 activated.
pnp: Failed to activate device 00:0b.   <========= this one
pnp: Device 01:01.00 activated.
   This is all shown while *suspending*, so it looks like
   the kernel is shutting down all the devices and brings
   them up again for some reason.  PNP device 00:0b is my
   keyboard.
 o There's the following sequence of messages in my dmesg:
Restarting tasks...<6>usb 1-1: USB disconnect, address 2
 done
usb 1-1: new low speed USB device using uhci_hcd and address 3
   It looks like either the formatting is wrong (missing \n in some
   printk() or something), or USB device(s) aren't shutting down/
   powered up at the appropriate time, or the connect/powerup
   event interferes with the stuff happening during "Restarting
   tasks...done" time.  For the end-user this is just a cosmetic
   glitch (improper formatting), but it as well may be some
   more serious prob.
Note I never tried swsusp before, so I've no idea how it usually
looks like, or should look like.  We've servers which never suspend,
we've X terminals (no need to suspend, and it will not work anyway
as the network connections will not be restored anyway), and this
my VIA-C3-based machine, which never worked due to the PSE check.
Thanks.
