Nah, most of us just trust Christoph to fight the good fight for us ;-)
I for one certainly agree with him that for static stuff, we don't need 
(or want) udev. For inherently hotplug stuff like USB cameras, or large 
SCSI raid arrays, it's nice, but not for basic things like mem devices 
and the disk devices I'm booting from - it's just added complexity.
If it works as is, don't screw with it.
