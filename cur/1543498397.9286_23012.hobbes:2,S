Hi guys,
I've done a patch to 2.3.5 that will improve schedule() switching speed
from 40 up to 70 %.
This patch use a set of "slot-of-goodness" in which schedule() search
the best task to run.
This results in a hi schedule() speed since the best task can be found
even in only 1 test while the previous one scan the entire runqueue list.
With this mail I include the patch and the little program
( great THX to Willy Terreau for his contribute ) used to test it.
The test program is very simple, it creates 450 threads that do nothing
but increment a counter and call syscall(SYS_sched_yield).
My results are:
2.3.5 Test 1 = 6169
2.3.5 Test 2 = 6087
Patch Test 1 = 8811
Patch Test 2 = 10325
Average gain = + 56 %  !!!!
I'll be happy if this patch will be tested by other Linux users ( better if
in high-loaded
environmets ) to get other results.
Good work to everybody, cheers,
            Davide.
