Thanks for spotting this bug and rest of your review comments.
Here's V4 of the patchset, aimed at improving fairness of cpu bandwidth
allocation for task groups.
Changes since V3 (
http://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=119605252303359
):
- Fix bug in setting SCHED_RR priority for load_balance_monitor thread
- Fix coding style related issues
- Separate "introduction of lock_doms_cur() API" into a separate patch
I have also tested this patchset against your latest git tree as of
today morning.
Please apply if there are no major concerns.
