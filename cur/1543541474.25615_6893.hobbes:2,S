Amen to that - I'm doing a 2.4 port currently and our architecture has all
DRAM at a pseudo-physical address 0xc0000000. Figuring out how to not make
mem_map start at 0 and waste a lot of struct page's to cover everything up
to 0xc0000000 and beyond, and what the __pa/__va things should do wrgds to
the pseudo-0xc0000000 took some hours of groping around the archs and
bootmem/zone code :) then it suddenly worked.. and like, "wow, don't touch
it again!" :) 
(luckily I found a comment in mm/numa.c about exactly that and that m68k
and arm used it - you could never have been led to believe that looking
through the non-commented source :) 
The relationships between virtual/logical/physical etc. can be extremely
confusing - our CPU has physical DRAM at 0x40000000 but it is segmented
into 0xc0000000 in kernel-mode, while the paged virtual memory is at 0.
Heh. Fortunately the 0x40000000 business can be largely ignored since it
is only visible inside the TLB - for all other purposes the DRAM is at
0xc... 
So what I ended up doing was to make __pa/__va convert between 0xc.. and
0x4.., put PAGE_OFFSET == 0xc.., max/min_low_pfn's at 0xc..., mem_map
indexes start at 0 (corresponding to 0xc).. seems to work so far :) 
It does not help of course that all archs do the bootmem and zone
initialization in their own ways :)
