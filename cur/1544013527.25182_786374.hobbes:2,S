That sounds like a feature Windows had for many years now, (since
Windows 2000?).  It complements the Windows equivlant of
dnotify/inotify/fsnotify.
It's used for file indexing too (think equivalent to Spotlight,
Beagle, etc.), and other types of security scanning (think equivalent
to Tripwire).
I wonder why the people writing file indexing tools for Linux never
made a fuss about this.  Inotify is ok for indexing, but means quite a
few minutes of intensive disk activity after each boot to rescan /home.
