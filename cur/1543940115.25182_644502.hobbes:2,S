Can you switch back to old IDE to get your work done (and to make sure 
it's not a hardware issue that's developed recently)? I believe libata is 
just a whole lot pickier about behavior than the IDE subsystem was, so 
it's more likely to complain about stuff, both for good reasons and when 
it shouldn't, and there are a slew of potential "we have to accept that 
old PATA hardware does this" bugs that all have the same symptom of "we go 
into error handling when nothing is actually wrong", hence the vast 
quantity of hits. I think it's not exactly that it's a common problem as 
that it's a lot of problems that aren't very distinguishable.
