i dont mean "implement call-all as a series of call-single" calls, but 
use just a single queue of requests and differentiate on the data 
structure level. Right now you use the vector # as the differentiator.
but ... no strong feelings, i'm just playing the devil's advocate :) 
Your work is great (and i now see that i forgot to state this clearly 
enough in my first mail - i thought i to be obvious, based on your 
numbers!), i'm really just trying to micro-optimize the concept.
Could you try to unify it with the 32-bit code, preferably into a 
separate, unified arch/x86/kernel/smp.c file? Such an approach would 
make it into x86.git in a heartbeat :)

it's ~0.5% of our irq vector space? :-)
we could also try to implement a "NOP" type of single call [ using a nop 
callback is one of the easiest possibilities there ;) ] - which would 
allow us to eliminate the special reschedule vector as well. That means 
we could consolidate all the SMP cross-calls into a single vector.
OTOH, i see how you save multiplexing/demultiplexing complexity on both 
the sending and the receiving side by using the separate vectors. So i 
guess, if it's fast enough, we should indeed do your two vectors 
approach and also merge the reschedule special vector into the 
single-call path and thus have no effect on the size of the vector 
space. (no need to add a new vector even - just rename the reschedule 
vector to single-call vector)
