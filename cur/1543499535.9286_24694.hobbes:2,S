What are these other machines?  Is B running Linux 2.2?  (hunch if the
following makes sense)  What does the Tcp line in /proc/net/snmp look
like: is InErrs > 0?

Might it be related to a 24 day uptime?  I had problems with
tcp_paws_discard erronoeously discarding incoming packets because an ACK
was received before a data packet, and in the process I noticed that it
makes use of a 24 day timestamp.  If you're seeing InErrs going up when
the connection freeze is happening, then it's probably the source of the
bug.  Also, it's quite evident in a tcpdump as you can see the host
receiving a packet, but not ACKing it.  See
http://www.kvack.org/~blah/a.leeloo
 for one such trace.
