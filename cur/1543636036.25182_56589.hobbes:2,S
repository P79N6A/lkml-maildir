Maybe the control files are small enough to fit in one disk block,
making the operations atomic in practice.  Or something.

Yeah, but it's a shame if those combinations require performance hits
like "synchronous directory updates" or, worse, "fsync() == sync()".
I really wish MTA authors would just support Linux's "fsync the
directory" approach.  It is simple, reliable, and fast.  Yes, it does
require Linux-specific support in the application, but that's what
application authors should expect when there is a gap in the
standards.
