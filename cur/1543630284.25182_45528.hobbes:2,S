It's UP machine with UP kernel. I haven't tried it now strace'ing 'cat
/proc/1234/cmdline' (on 2.5.15) but as I remember from earlier kernels it
hanged on file reading processes. I'll try to make some additional tests as
soon as I'll be back from short vacation
ls'ing /proc/1234 doesn't hangs but ls -al does.
BTW: from my earlier post:
<cut>
mremap(0x407c5000, 8192, 12288, MREMAP_MAYMOVE) = 0x407c1000
brk(0x82e5000)                          = 0x82e5000
brk(0x82e6000)                          = 0x82e6000
old_mmap(NULL, 135168, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS,
-1, 0) = 0x407dc000
mremap(0x407ce000, 8192, 12288, MREMAP_MAYMOVE
</cut>
This is strace poldek on 2.5.11 kernel (behaviour is the same)
WK
P.S. now I can't reproduce it (on 2.5.15) as it's glibc compilation and it
takes far too long and has many subprocesses, but poldek issue on 2.5.11/12
was reproductible.
