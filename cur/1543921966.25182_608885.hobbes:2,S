Yes.  If you have a problem at level n, it should always reappear for n-1 etc.

They certainly are ACPI-related, because the only difference between level 4
and level 3 suspend testing is that some global ACPI methods are executed
at level 3 (in addition to level 4).
Unfortunately, I have no idea what to do next, for now.
I think you can file a bug report at 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org
 and put a link
to this thread in there (against ACPI and please add my address to the CC
list).
Greetings,
