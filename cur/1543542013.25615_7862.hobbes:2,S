The "all" branch is very nice.  Taking a look at a driver I happen to know
quite well, it looks like the patch ordering for the all branch is a bit wierd.

It looks like patches were perhaps applied backwards (i.e. linux 2.3.10 was
produced by patching from linux 2.3.12, which was produced by patching from
linux 2.3.15).
