To me too. Acronyms tend to be treated as opaque tokens in English:
their expansions tend not be be well known and don't really interact
with their usage. "LCD display" is fine, and is clearer than both
"LCD" or "liquid crystal display". (Some users won't know that a
"liquid crystal display" is what they know as an "LCD display").
