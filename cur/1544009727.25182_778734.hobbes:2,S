Hi,
who maintains that pipe buffer magic in 2.6? 
Reason I'm asking: The kernel 2.4 branch does not sanitize pipe
buffers, but there's a trivial patch to achieve this [1]
I'd like to have the option to sanitize pipe buffers in 2.6.x kernels
too, so I'm looking for a person to talk to. From what I heard,
in kernel 2.6 branch pipe magic works differently. To what extend
exactly? Or are pipe buffers already sanitized in the 2.6 kernel
branch? (I doubt that)
In light of the cold-boot attack[2] I'd like to have pipe buffers
sanitized. So, how do I achieve this? Any hints?
