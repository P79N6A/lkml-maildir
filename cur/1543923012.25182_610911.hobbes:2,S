Hmm...what prevents dma_chan_cleanup() from being called while someone
still holds a reference to the "class" device? This will allow the
module removal to proceed, the device to be freed, and things will blow
up...
I think my patch is better. By taking two references, the order in
which the cleanup functions are called doesn't matter -- both have to
complete before the module removal is allowed to proceed.
