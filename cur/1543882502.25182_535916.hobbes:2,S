Seems like the bug tracking system needs to be re-evaluated. Perhaps Bugzilla 
can be modified to better serve the needs of kernel developers.
There might be alternatives, JIRA (
http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/
) 
for example. I am sure there are others.
Finally, I have over 7 years experience writing various web based systems 
(using WebObjects, J2EE and others). I would be quite willing to volunteer my 
spare time and experience if this community decides that a custom written 
solution (one that would handle email bug submissions/resolutions :) is in 
order.
Kind regards,
