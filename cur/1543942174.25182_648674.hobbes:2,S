Block transfer sizes over about 64kB are totally irrelevant for 99% of all 
people.
Don't even bother testing anything more. Yes, bigger transfers happen, but 
a lot of common loads have *smaller* transfers than 64kB.
So benchmarks that try to find "theoretical throughput" by just making big 
transfers should just be banned. They give numbers, yes, but the numbers 
are pointless.
