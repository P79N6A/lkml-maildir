Actually it has made a measurable difference both to the computer society
and to Swansea University. Yes maybe to an extent it is advertising but its
also very important as a motivator.
I don't actually think you can remove the copyrights either. It just isnt clear
if a printk is a copyright message or not.  If the printk counts as a copyright
statement then I don't think it can be casually removed, at least not in the UK
