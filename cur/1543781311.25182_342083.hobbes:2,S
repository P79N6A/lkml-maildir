yes I already said I tried apic mode, that's the one that works "best" but I 
suspect that's reflecting the fact that I hardly ever go below 300Hz on this 
machine except in init 1. Time definitely was lost the longer the machine was 
running.

suitable:       1
enabled:        1
apic suitable:  1
using APIC:     1
(remember I wrote the sysfs portion ;) )

You mean disable it at runtime or not compile it in at all? Disabling it at 
runtime caused what I described to you as PIT mode (long stalls etc).

ACPI: Local APIC address 0xfee00000
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x00] lapic_id[0x00] enabled)
Processor #0 15:2 APIC version 20
ACPI: LAPIC (acpi_id[0x01] lapic_id[0x01] enabled)
Processor #1 15:2 APIC version 20
ACPI: LAPIC_NMI (acpi_id[0x00] high edge lint[0x1])
ACPI: LAPIC_NMI (acpi_id[0x01] high edge lint[0x1])
ACPI: IOAPIC (id[0x02] address[0xfec00000] gsi_base[0])
IOAPIC[0]: apic_id 2, version 32, address 0xfec00000, GSI 0-23
Enabling APIC mode:  Flat.  Using 1 I/O APICs
mapped APIC to ffffd000 (fee00000)
mapped IOAPIC to ffffc000 (fec00000)
