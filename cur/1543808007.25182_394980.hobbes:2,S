  OK, I'll have to wait for that I guess.

  Yes the kernel is still compiled for SMP. An UP compiled kernel did
not boot. I will try to fix it and go for it again.

  The more I think about it, the more I tend to believe it's hardware 
related. It seems as if the CPU just hangs for ~27 ms before
resuming processing.
  Anyway, here is my .config. Maybe I've got something misconfigured
somewhere after all.
  Thanks for replying.
