I vote for this. Userland has no business with HZ; and you could very well
envision a ssytem where HZ changes (OS sees high CPU bound load ==> HZ goes
up; load gets more interactive ==> HZ goes down; CPU speeding up/down
(Crusoe)) or even has no real global meaning anymore ("HZ" depends on the
specific use)
