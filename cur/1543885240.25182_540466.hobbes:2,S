Interesting; I'm seeing exactly the same thing on a Vaio TXN17P, which
popped up somewhere between Fedora's 2.6.21-1.2116 and 2.6.21-1.2125
kernels, but the changelog there shows little more than wireless fixes
and the 2.6.21.1 patch.

The same for me.  It's odd to think that identical symptoms are caused
by something completely different, but I guess this is the kernel.
