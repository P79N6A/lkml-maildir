By not treating ATAPI the same as all other SCSI devices.

There are various programs that do that for you.
You could e.g. send a ping to the broadcast address in order to find hosts
that are on the local network.

If you understand this, why then insists other people in using names like 
/dev/hd*?

And while this kind of scanning works in case that you have all devices 
integrated inside a single SCSI implementation, it does not work for ATAPI
because someont artificially decided to exclude one single SCSI transport 
from the global view.
And regarding iSCSI, If you like to talk to such a device, you need to 
authentificate first. This is typically done by the kernel that in turn
trnaferres the remote iSCSI device into a virtual local SCSI device.
