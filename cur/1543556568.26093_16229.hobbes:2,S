See, in an ideal world, that shouldn't be the case, at all.
Since we're NOT operating under the assumption that the serial console is
a modem, we should be - instead - operating under the assumption
that it is a 3-wire NULL connection. (thus, making NO assumptions about
the user's hardware..)
If the user wants to ADD RTS/CTS flow control or DCD based state checking
as an OPTION, well, hey.  whatever. Pick your poison.  But i sure as hell
wouldn't do it that way.
