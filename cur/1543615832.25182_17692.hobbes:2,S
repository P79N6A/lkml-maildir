	Any comments on how useful it would be to have paged, segmented,
memory support for Pentium? I was thinking that by having separate
segments for text, stack, and heap, buffer overrun exploits would be
eliminated (I'm aware that this would require GCC patching as well).
	Obviously, I'm thinking that I (and any similar fools I could rope
in) would try this (Probably delivering for a kernel at least a year out
of date by the time we had a patch).
Sorry
if this is too userspace.
