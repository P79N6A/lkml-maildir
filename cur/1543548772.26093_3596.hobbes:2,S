I'm checking on it now. Here's a strace with setsid() ahead, same
problem:
close(3)                                = 0
mprotect(0x4000c000, 569344, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE) = 0
mprotect(0x4000c000, 569344, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC) = 0
SYS_136(0, 0x1, 0x4009c02c, 0xbffff77c, 0xbffff774) = 0
getpid()                                = 6 
setsid()                                = 6 
open("/dev/tty1", O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)    = 3
fcntl(3, F_GETFL)                       = 0x802 (flags O_RDWR|O_NONBLOCK)
fcntl(3, F_SETFL, O_RDWR)               = 0
dup2(3, 0)                              = 0
dup2(3, 1)                              = 1
dup2(3, 2)                              = 2
ioctl(3, TIOCSCTTY)                     = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)
brk(0)                                  = 0x8049fdc
brk(0x804a02c)                          = 0x804a02c
brk(0x804b000)                          = 0x804b000
