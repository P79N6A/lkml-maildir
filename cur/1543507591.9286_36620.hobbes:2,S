Yes, I have already heard about this, but never used such a option. This
one really makes me angry since I am using CVS. Trying to work on
the project both under Linux & Win gives me headaches... especially
when filenames come with cases I don't expect... The way I go around
this is to bzip&tar the CVS tree under Linux and unbzip it under Win and
vice versa... really annoying.
