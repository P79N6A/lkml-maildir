A voluntary context switch is where a task gives up the processor
(e.g., by going to sleep, or by calling sched_yield()).
An involuntary context switch is where a task is preempted by some
other task.
(Another figure-of-merit might be how many times the process is
interrupted by a hardware interrupt)
