Ok I spotted and fixed that bug that forbidden my tree to boot with UP
compiles on alpha. The bug is that the SCHED_YIELD handling was broken
on alpha UP, this is the fix:

(SCHED_YIELD of the previous task is cleared by __schedule_tail, it
wasn't cleared so a non running task had a SCHED_YIELD set and it was
deadlocking, this can explain many malfunction of UP alpha kernels)
I never noticed so far because I always compiled it SMP.
