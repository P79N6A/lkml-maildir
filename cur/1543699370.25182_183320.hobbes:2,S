There is a known memory leak when creating tens of thousands of
threads on RHEL AS3 (NPTL-0.60). It's fixed in 1.4.2_04, which
should get released early next year. Also I've been told by Ulrich
that it's fixed on libc side too.
It's likely something else if you don't create that many of
threads. Send me an email if you have a testcase.
