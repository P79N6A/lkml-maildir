Heh, I though I wrote that when I originally asked Nick to bring back
his patch up to date :) Bah, anyway, you know now.

Yes but the lockless radix tree patch was floating around a long time
ago :)
Anyway, I can drop a spinlock in (in fact I have) the ppc64 irq code for
now but that sucks, thus we should really seriously consider having the
lockless tree in 2.6.18 or I might have to look into doing an alternate
implementation specifically in arch code... or find some other way of
doing the inverse mapping there...
