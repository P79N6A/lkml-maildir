CPUsets don't appear to scale to large numbers of containers (say 5000,
with 200-500 doing stuff at a time). They also don't appear to do any
tracking of kernel side resource objects, which is critical to
containment. Indeed for some of us the CPU management and user memory
management angle is mostly uninteresting.
I'm also not clear how you handle shared pages correctly under the fake
node system, can you perhaps explain that further how this works for say
a single apache/php/glibc shared page set across 5000 containers each a
web site.
