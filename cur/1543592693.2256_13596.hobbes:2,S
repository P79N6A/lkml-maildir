I would say "read the source, Luke" but Makefile and Rules.make is so
convoluted and twisted that it gives you a headache following the rule
interactions.  Edit drivers/sound/emu10k1/Makefile
CFLAGS_timer.o += -g	 for one file or
EXTRA_CFLAGS += -g	 for all files in the directory.
With the 2.5 makefile rewrite you will be able to do
make EXTRA_CFLAGS_drivers/sound/emu10k1.o=-g	 for just one file or
make EXTRA_CFLAGS_drivers/sound=-g		 for all files in directory.
No need to edit the Makefiles to set temporary flags, althought you can
if you wish.
