When I try "modprobe apm" I get these errors:
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test13-pre3/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/apm.o: unresolved
symbol pm_send_all
/lib/modules/2.4.0-test13-pre3/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/apm.o: unresolved
symbol pm_active
This is my first time building APM as a module, so I don't know when the
error was first introduced...
