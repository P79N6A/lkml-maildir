I'm now reading kernel source, but confused at spinlock:
typedef struct {
    volatile unsigned int lock ;
} spinlock ;
why the spinlock structure should be converted to dummy_lock_t
in inline asm code:
typedef struct { unsigned long a[100] ; } dummy_lock_t ;
#define dummy_lock(lock)  (*(dummy_lock_t*)(lock))
I see many conversion like this in kernel source, can anyone help me!!!
