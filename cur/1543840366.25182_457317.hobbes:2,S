One question on the implementation of kevent_user_ctl_modify/
kevent_user_ctl_remove/kevent_user_ctl_add:  What benchmarks did you
do to add the separate 'fastpath' with the single onstack ukevent
structure if there are three or less events?  I can't believe this
actually helps in practice for various reasons:
 - you add quite a lot of icache footprint by duplicating all this code
 - kmalloc is really fast
 - two or three small copy_from/to_user calls are quite a bit slower
   than one that covers the size of all of them.
