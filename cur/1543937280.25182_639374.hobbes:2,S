   Subject: mm: sysfs: expose the BDI object in sysfs
   Provide a place in sysfs for the backing_dev_info object.
   This allows us to see and set the various BDI specific variables.
   In particular this properly exposes the read-ahead window for all
   relevant users and /sys/block/<block>/queue/read_ahead_kb should be
   deprecated.

Dunno.  I feel, this is quite safe, because even the home-grown
parsers will likely care about any junk at the end of the line.  But
of course this cannot be proved.

That was meant to be IDA (from the IDR library).

I'll get rid of them.
