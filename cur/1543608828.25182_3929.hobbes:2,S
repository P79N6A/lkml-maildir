 These are chipset implementation details (i.e. address decoder's
shortcomings) only.  An 8259A only uses two I/O ports; in PC/AT systems,
these are 0x20, 0x21 and 0xa0, 0xa1 for the two PICs, respectively.  Since
the 0x00-0xff range is assigned to motherboard devices, there is no
problem with leaving aliases free -- they are never used by Linux.  You
still need to verify your extra devices are really present there.
