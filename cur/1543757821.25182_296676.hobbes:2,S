Mesage is never reached anyone if there are no listeners, skb will be just freed,
even without any linking.
do_one_broadcast() in net/netlink/af_netlink.c takes care of it.
Unicast message also will be discarded in cn_rx_skb().
These operations are quite cheap - just link/unlink skb to/from appropriate
queues.

Yes, to not leak kernel memory context.

Not necessary, I doubt fork userspace listener uses protocol described in
connector.c and relies on seq field since it is not needed to have acks/replays.
Although it can be used as a flag that it is new fork, but message itself
is already such an event.

Yes it can be local.
