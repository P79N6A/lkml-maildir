Alan, could you provide a code snipped to show how easy it is and how well
it fits a 1:N ( one task/thread , N connections ) architecture ? And
looking at Ben's presentation about benchmarks ( and for pipe's ), you'll
discover that both poll() and AIO are "a little bit slower" than
sys_epoll. Anyway I do not want anything superflous added to the kernel
w/out reason, that's why, beside the Ben's presentation, there're curretly
people benchmarking existing solutions.
