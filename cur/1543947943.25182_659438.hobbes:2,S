That's a good point.

Did you read my suggestion?  We use one bit in the pte to specify that
its a large page mapping, then specify a mask to apply to the address to
get the *first* mapping of the large page, where you're find the actual
physical address.  That keeps us from having to worry about specifying
*both* the page size and the pfn in the same pte.

I'm just asking that you please put this in a nice helper function to
hide it from the poor powerpc/ia64/mips... guys that don't want to see
x86 code cluttering up otherwise generic functions.  Yes, the compiler
optimizes it away, but it still has a cost to my eyeballs. :)
I eagerly await your next patch!
