I think we should take system ram out of the iomem file, at least.
'struct resource' is a good, cross-platform structure to use for keeping
track of which memory we have where.  So, we can share that structure to
keep track of iomem, or memory hotplug state.  But, I'm not sure we
should be intermingling system RAM and iomem like we are now in the same
instance of the structure.
