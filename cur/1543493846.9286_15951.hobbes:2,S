Yes.
But save the old version away as a "lat_mmap_write" or something.
Btw, you need to fix lat_mmap anyway: right now the summary information
gives random numbers that depend on how large an area the user asked you
to use. So you can't compare lat_mmap by looking at the summary stuff,
which kind of defeats having a summary in the first place.
I'd suggest taking the 1MB (or some other fixed size) number into the
summary.

I don't think it should much matter. But I don't have any numbers, so..
