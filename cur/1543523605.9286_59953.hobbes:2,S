First, let me apologize for this slightly OT question; I have done web
searches and usenet posts in attempts to find and answer, but have come up
empty - this list is my last resort.
My question:  how do I get my system to recognize quotas larger than 4G?
I'm running RH6.1 with all the updates and my own 2.2.14 kernel.
According to /usr/src/linux/Documentation/Changes:
   "If you are using large quotas, you should upgrade your quota utils;
newer versions count file sizes in blocks instead of bytes, providing
an upper limit of terabytes instead of 4 GB."
Handy, since I'm soon going to be building a system with ~200G of storage
for only a half-dozen users.  The document then later points to a site to
obtain quota-1.55-10. Well, I'm using quota-1.66-8, and still cant get it
to work right.
For example, 'quota mnelson' currently shows:
  Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limitgrace
   /dev/hdb4 2391437 4000000       0            4916       0       0
if I 'edquota -u mnelson', and change the quota to look like:
Quotas for user mnelson:
/dev/hdb4: blocks in use: 2391437, limits (soft = 5000000, hard = 0)
        inodes in use: 4916, limits (soft = 0, hard = 0)
then do a 'quota mnelson' again, I get:
  Filesystem  blocks   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit grace
   /dev/hdb4 2391437* 805696       0    none    4916       0       0
This is obviously being hit by a 4G quota limit.
How do I get big quotas working?
