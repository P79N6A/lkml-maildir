Note that NONE of this is going to happen for 2.4.x.
We've never _ever_ done this before, there's no point in even suggesting
that this is suddenly a "critical" bug. It's not.
I want to know what the suggestion for 2.4.x is. Right now that's the "if
the count is elevated, we don't invalidate". 
Quite frankly, I don't see any other option. Doing the !Uptodate version
will lose local data as it stands now - in fact right now you'd lose data
that way even if you are the only client accessing the file, which is
obviously complete crap and _completely_ unacceptable.
I'm open to suggestions, but I haven't heard anything realistic.
