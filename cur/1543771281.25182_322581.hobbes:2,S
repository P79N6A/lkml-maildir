Hello,
     We have been evaluating a project to develop linux driver
and stack for SPI-4 devices. SPI-4 stands for System Packet Interface
Level 4.
While searching on internet I came across a few articles on SPI-4 protocol.
One of the links is given below:
http://www.altera.com/products/devices/stratixgx/features/sgx-spi.html
Is there any update on linux driver support for SPI-4 devices?
Thanks,
