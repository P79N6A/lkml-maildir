I don't think so.
Suppose to create a symlink on the disk, say /usr/src/linux, that
points to /usr/src/linux-2.6.23, the best way is:
# cd /usr/src/
# ln -s linux-2.6.23 linux
# ls -l linux
# ls -l linux
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 2007-10-16 19:21 linux -> linux-2.6.23
other than:
# cd /usr/src/
# ln -s /usr/src/linux-2.6.23 linux
or
# ln -s ../../usr/src/linux-2.6.23 linux
# ls -l linux
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 2007-10-16 19:21 linux -> ../../usr/src/linux-2.6.23
Anyone know this, since sysfs is also a filesystem, it should conform
the perfect way.
For another point, consider the code in fs/sysfs/symlink.c:
static int sysfs_get_target_path(struct sysfs_dirent * parent_sd,
                                 struct sysfs_dirent * target_sd, char *path)
{
...
        size = object_path_length(target_sd) + depth * 3 - 1;
        if (size > PATH_MAX)
                return -ENAMETOOLONG;
Since having longer readlink result would consume more memory on the
output parameter path, that is error prone to return -ENAMETOOLONG; we
just need the shorter readlink result.

Yes. there are already some other symlinks those are also not crossing
top subdirectory of /sys, they would benefit from this patch:
I have found all of them by this little shell:
$ find /sys -type l -printf '%p -> %l -> ' -exec readlink -f '{}' \; | gawk '{
        split($1, a, "/");
        split($5, b, "/");
        if (a[3] == b[3])
                print;
}'
that will print many lines like:
...
/sys/block/hdd/subsystem -> ../../block -> /sys/block
/sys/module/snd_mixer_oss/holders/snd_pcm_oss ->
../../../module/snd_pcm_oss -> /sys/module/snd_pcm_oss
/sys/class/sound/audio/subsystem -> ../../../class/sound -> /sys/class/sound
/sys/class/pci_bus/0000:00/subsystem -> ../../../class/pci_bus ->
/sys/class/pci_bus
