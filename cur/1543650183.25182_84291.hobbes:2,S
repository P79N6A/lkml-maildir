Just tried 2.5.44 plain, mm, ac, and 2.5.43
doing tracepath on 2.5.44-based kernels will stop at
sendto(3,
"\1\0\0\0\202}\275=\216j\4\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0"..., 65507,
0, {sin_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(44444),
sin_addr=inet_addr("194.87.0.50")}}, 16 <unfinished ...>
iputils is 020124 (actually 020124-r1 from gentoo but I think it
doesnt matter)
2.5.43 works fine here.
Any comments?
