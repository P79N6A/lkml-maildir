Tweaking kernel_stat.h is no longer necessary if you're running recent ac.
Alan merged a patch that exposes significantly more devices to /proc/stat.
I haven't checked if it went into the 2.4.10 pres as well. Unfortunately, the
patch also slightly changed the meaning of some of the entries so you'll
need grab current noflushd-CVS to make it work on the second ide channel.
Still, you might prefer that to patching the kernel. :)
Regards,
Daniel.
