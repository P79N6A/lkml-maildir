That's probably Andrea's pte-highmem code, which uses the
global kmap pool instead of doing cpu-local atomic kmaps.
He's been told about this becoming a scalability problem
but didn't believe it since I didn't have any numbers for
him.  Maybe he believes it now since you've measured it ;)

You really want the pte-highmem by Arjan and Ingo, which uses
kmap_atomic (which is CPU-local and doesn't suffer the same
scalability problem as the global kmap pool).
