I do agree with what you say here. Maybe a summary:
Babies, bathwater...
When you have a hammer (license) everything looks like a nail...

My concern is around embedded type systems and maybe even the 'trusted' 
frameworks etc.
I _think_ I can see a completely opensource system that the end user cannot 
modify _in any way_. Which kinda defeats the point (to me) of opensource.
This 5 minute design undoubtedly has flaws but it shows a direction:
A basically standard 'De11' PC with some flash.
A Tivoised boot system so only signed kernels boot.
A modified kernel that only runs (FOSS) executables whose signed hash lives in 
the flash.
Do we (you) _want_ to prevent this?
Do we trust in 'the market' to prevent this?
Do we use license tools?
