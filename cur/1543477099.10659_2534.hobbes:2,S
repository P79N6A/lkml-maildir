Just for kicks I decided to let mhz.estimate run for a while in a loop, that
way I get thousands more quite-possibly-less-accurate statistics. Out of
59000 runs, here are the most deviant 20:
374.865421
374.865944
374.865967
374.866508
374.866577
374.867146
374.867292
374.867333
374.867610
374.867645
[...]
374.947681
374.947712
374.947716
374.947962
374.952847
374.960404
378.688356
378.688474
378.689010
378.725015
Another interesting statistic:
cat mhz.estimate.output | wc -l
  59218
cat mhz.estimate.output | cut -f1 -d' ' | sort | uniq | wc -l
  11147
After running gnuplot over it, I see a very straight line. It appears my
motherboard's clock is not affected by temperature. There are some
interesting dips and jolts but nothing resembling a curve.
Adding up all the numbers and dividing by 59218 gives us:
374.929090476, meaning the max deviation is -.063669476/+3.795924524.
The average deviation, something much more useful, I'm too lazy to
calculate. :)
Stripping out anything so deviant to not be in the 374 range, our plot looks
like so:

mhz.estimate.c is below:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
/* returns number of clock cycles since last reboot */
__inline__ unsigned long long int rdtsc()
{
	unsigned long long int x;
	__asm__ volatile (".byte 0x0f, 0x31" : "=A" (x));
	return x;
}
main ()
{
	/* find out the MHz of the processor by dividing
	 * clock cycles by seconds */
	
	struct timezone tz;
        struct timeval tvstart, tvstop;
        unsigned long long int cycles[2]; /* gotta be 64 bit */
	unsigned int microseconds; /* total time taken */
	
	bzero(&tz, sizeof(tz));
	gettimeofday(&tvstart, &tz);
	cycles[0] = rdtsc();
	gettimeofday(&tvstart, &tz);
#ifdef VERBOSE
	printf("Clock cycles at start: %Lu\n", cycles[0]);
#endif
	usleep(1000000);
	
	cycles[1] = rdtsc();
	gettimeofday(&tvstop, &tz);
	microseconds = ((tvstop.tv_sec-tvstart.tv_sec)*1000000)+(tvstop.tv_usec-tvstart.tv_usec);
#ifdef VERBOSE	
	printf("Clock cycles at end:   %Lu\n", cycles[1]);
	printf("Microseconds elapsed:  %u\n", microseconds);
#endif	
	printf("%f MHz processor.\n", (float)(cycles[1]-cycles[0])/microseconds);
}
