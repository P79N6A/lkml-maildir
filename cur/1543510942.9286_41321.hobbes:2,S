The speed figure comes out of the capabilities page and as
such I just have to believe what the drive tells me. DVD drives
are covered by newer specs (Mt Fuji / MMC) that report the
cap page as being deprecated, but considering the huge gaps
drives otherwise exhibit wrt these specs, I'm suprised that
Pioneer decided to drop the speed listing all together. A
more fancy speed reading can be obtained through the newer
GET_PERFORMANCE command, but I'm not going to look at that
merely for reporting a more "correct" max speed.
