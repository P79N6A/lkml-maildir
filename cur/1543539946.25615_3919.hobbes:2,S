Release 0.7.4: Wed Jul 26 12:07:47 EDT 2000
	* Randy Dunlap has certified the USB configuration.
	* 'x' and 'q' reversed in curses and tty modes.  'q' now matches
	  the semantics of the Tk Quit menu entry.
	* We no longer write FOO=n in defconfig; this turned out
	  to break a large number of ifdefs in old-style makefiles 
	  in the Linux kernel tree.
That third bullet item means that CML2 will not be able to do the
right thing and support passing around partial configs until about 300
lines in various Makefiles are changed.  Sigh...this may mean I put off
issuing 1.0.0 until after CML2 has been accepted into the tree and those
changes get made,
There are currently a couple of minor look and feel issues in the Tk
interface, but no known bugs.

...Virtually never are murderers the ordinary, law-abiding people
against whom gun bans are aimed.  Almost without exception, murderers
are extreme aberrants with lifelong histories of crime, substance
abuse, psychopathology, mental retardation and/or irrational violence
against those around them, as well as other hazardous behavior, e.g.,
automobile and gun accidents."
