Hi,
You can use signals like the example in the book rubini (see the asynchronous notification section).
http://www.xml.com/ldd/chapter/book/index.html
Be sure to download the examples (especially the "scull" example).
thanks,
Hari.

Subject: kernel notification to user space task
Hi,
  I have a user task running ...
I want my driver running in kernel to send a notification to this task when
it detects some event.
for example..if my driver detects that interface 'eth0' is coming up, it
should send a indication to user task saying 'network interface eth0 is up'
please cc me..
thanks
Amol
