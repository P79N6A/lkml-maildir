I'm trying to be carefull. How common are ioctls that are
COMPATIBLE_IOCTL(foo) on one arch, but not on another? So far I tried
to decide, and mostly decided that one architecture was simply
missing...

Well, if I'm a little more carefull, all I will change will be order
of fields in that ioctl32_start table. Should I aim for that?
