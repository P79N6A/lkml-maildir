I know - we used to have problems even with restoring to normal text-mode
if it was set to anything except for 80x25.
But I really think that it should be easy to tell X not to switch modes,
and just tell it hat mode it is in. The modeswitching part of X is the
most fragile and yet the least important one, so this would get all of the
advantages of having a kernel fb device with none of the disadvantages.
Dirk, who in the XFree86 team should people talk to about something like
this? The current situation where the kernel frame buffer and a regular X
server don't always work together is just silly.

Good. However, some interaction does seem to exist, as I've gotten reports
of the Matrox X server being extremely slow to paint the screen with the
new framebuffer code as of 2.1.132. That must be something else than just
modeswitching.
