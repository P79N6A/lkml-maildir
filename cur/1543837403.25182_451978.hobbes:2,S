I did stabilize ABI - I can be using the same (bit to bit) audio driver
regardless of changes in the kernel not related to ALSA.
I can consider this whole ugly and clumsy construct as a "super"
kernel in which by construction nothing changes in the audio part.
That, I as end user don't care what developers break in the non-audio
part of this kernel - for me audio part is stable.
I let the non-audio part evolve while the audio part remains the
same - even at binary level.
