No, reiser3 still does not have proper locking.  It uses the BKL for
everything.  This will not be fixed as reiser3 is in maintenance mode.
According to Hans "the fix is reiser4".
This came up early in the voluntary preemption development process, we
found reiser3 to be unusable for low latency audio due to the excessive
BKL use disabling preemption all over the place.
It would be interesting to test reiser3 with the preemptible BKL
enabled.
