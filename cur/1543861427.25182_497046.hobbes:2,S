 I eventually found it ("Local APIC support on uniprocessors") in
menuconfig.  In the meantime, I'd moved my 32-bit activity to a
different box (also athlon64, but a bit faster) and I had one oops
on that.  At least, I assume it was an oops - the caps and scroll
LEDs flashed, but I couldn't do anything with MagicSysrq, not even
force a reboot.  Ran diff on the various configs, changed to IO-APIC
plus an unrelated change to use libata for the cdrom.  The faster box
_seems_ stable (used for a couple of hours, and then for a whole day)
so I'm back on the original problem machine.
 Last night I reconfigured the kernel (select X86_UP_APIC, deselect
ACPI_VIDEO [ had been a module ], select ACPI_DEBUG, select PCI_MSI
(had been on in my 64-bit configs), removed some ATA/ATAPI drivers I
didn't need).  I was running on the 'old' 2.6.19.1 while I built it,
and again got the flashing LEDs after the build, but nothing logged
although I was able to force a reboot with SysRq b.
 I guess that when it does have problems, it is mostly within 30
minutes of booting - otherwise, it can be up all day.  So, for the
moment I'm hopeful that changing the config will help, but it will
be several days before I feel at all confident.
