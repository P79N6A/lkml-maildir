Linux Folks,
The NWFS 2.0 Binaries are now available at 207.109.151.240.  You will
also note that we are publishing the Windows NT/2000 Drivers and Tools. 
All the tools needed to create, manage, and repair Netware volumes are
also included on this server for MS-DOS(DR-DOS), Linux, and Windows
NT/2000.  The Windows NT/2000 File System Drivers also have special
tools for mounting and dismounting.  There are also some diagnostic
tools provided as well.  
We still have work left for Linux in the following areas:
1.  Macintosh "HFS" style file names for NetWare MAC data stuff.
2.  Memory Usage issues between the Linux LRU and Netware LRU.
3.  Stage Two ASYNC I/O Elevator for the LRU.
4.  Some Directory File Stuff in NWREPAIR.
New versions of these tools will be posted regularly to fix bugs, add
more features, etc.  This version has full mirroring and fault tolerant
failover capability. 
We will have an update in several weeks with the completed elevator to
increase performance.
We have had some problems with our FTP server due to address
pcluster3.dnsdhcp.provo.novell.com doing stuff to our servers.  You may
notice some nasty language on our FTP servers telling Novell to stay off
our site.  We are 
delaying putting any source code up on the site until Novell complies. 
Our FTP servers were 
down for about a week due to these problems.
Also, we will be distributing NetMigrate on Linux as Well as Windows
NT/2000.  We have completed out NetWare/NTFS File System Conversion
tools, and want to put out something similiar for
EXT2.  Is there a way with the RAID stuff to concatonate together
several partitions and
make them look like one logical partition?  We can do this under NT for
converting multi-segment
NetWare volumes to NTFS, and want to do the same for EXT2 (we will give
this tools away since
it is on Linux).  Without this capability, it is not possible to convert
NetWare to EXT2 
in-place.
Bugs, please email jmerkey@timpanogas.com.  We will update stuff as we
have time in between 
our Windows NT/2000 and Linux clustering projects.
Jeff
