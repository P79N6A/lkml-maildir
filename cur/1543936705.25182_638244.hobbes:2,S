Which patch was that exactly? I don't see an obvious candidate. It was
git-x86 of friday or so. I still got the whole patch, but not the change
set tip because I've updated since again.
The hang happened while I started a large java program (groupwise) and
the machine was dead as in no pings anymore.
KVM might have been running in the background but only idling (I earlier
managed to oops the 2.6.24-rc* KVM, but only with a special guest 
which was not active at that time)
