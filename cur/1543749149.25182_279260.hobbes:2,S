It conflicts :) When I wrote the original patch for 2.6.8.1
I didnt see the unlocked_ioctl.patch.
unlocked_ioctl is the same as ioctl_native in my patch, except that
1. I added more documentation in several places :)
   (notably Documentation/filesystems/Locking)
2. I thought it a bit silly to name a function for what
   it does not do (does not take a lock), and we
   still need a call for the compat layer.
My patch adds another call to enable special handling
for 32 bit ioctls on 64 bit systems.
I could look at porting to -rc3-mm1, unless
we dont want to back unlocked_ioctl.patch off.
What do people here think?
