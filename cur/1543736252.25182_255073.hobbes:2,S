Hi,
I was writing to my sata drive, and I've just had this :
Sep 24 14:26:58 odie kernel: scsi1: ERROR on channel 0, id 0, lun 0, 
CDB: Read (10) 00 03 14 ca a7 00 00 08 00

Since 7 sept, I had "EXT3-fs warning: mounting fs with errors, running
e2fsck is recommended" when mounting this drive. So I tried to fsck, but
it hangs and nothing happened.
Please help :)
Fabian
