I've tried on the last 2 hrs like you, copying the .config from the
2.4.x kernel (slack 10.2) to the newest stable 2.6.15.4. The situation
now was:
1. before, the mouse worked fine. now, it doesnt works
2. before, the sound worked. and now, still working, just with ALSA,
no OSS support (tested with mpg321 and ogg123 on bash terminal)
3. strangely, the X worked fine after the kernel update, is DRM and
AGPGART needed by Xorg?
4. before, the PPPoE connected within the 2 first "." (seconds?). Now,
doesnt work, I always get TIMEOUT from PPPoE.
5. the PNPDUMP returns a empty file on the isapnptools (from the
compilation, this is the only file that gets fully compiled)
This situation happened on the Slackware 10.2, assuming a Kernel
Update. I've tryed to do the same on the last 10 mins, but the
compilation of the kernel took too long, around 50 min (I did a small
kernel just with IDE and got on 5min, and a smart kernel for my system
took 15~ mins).
On the LFS system, I still cant compile net-tools, gpm. =/
@Chris, I couldn't get the dmesg, cuz I put fire on my HDC1 first =P
and lsmod doesnt matter to much since most hardware I compile as
built-in, so it doesn't show. But I did a TarGz of this distro hehe,
so I'll try it again and show up to you here.
