Ok, but every one of those examples is pretty much orthogonal to how
the Linux kernel treats mmap(PROT_EXEC).  The only thing you are relying
upon is that ld.so knows how to avoid unintentionally execute programs
that live on noexec partitions.  As long as ld.so has some way to tell
the kernel "please check for me whether this program lives on a noexec
partition; if it does, please bail out", then you'll get all of the benefits
you list and all of your use cases will be unaffected, no matter what
other semantics are assigned to mmap().
Here were your examples:
