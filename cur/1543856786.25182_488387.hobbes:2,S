Well, the code isn't big-endian safe yet, but the only place where I expect to 
have to fix this is in fw-ohci.c.  I need to figure out how I want to set up 
the OHCI controller to this - it has a couple of bits to control this.  All 
data outside the low-level driver is cpu-endian, with the exception of payload 
data.  IEEE1394 doesn't specify an endianness for the payload data, even 
though most protocols use big-endian.    Some protocols have a mix of 
byte-arrays and be32 words (eg SBP-2) so it's up to the protocol to byteswap 
its data as appropriate.

Ok... I was planning to make big-endian versions of the structs so that the 
endian issue would be solved.  But if the bit layout is not consistent, I 
guess bitfields are useless for wire formats.  I didn't know that though, I 
thought the C standard specified that the compiler should allocate bits out of 
a word using the lower bits first.  Is the problem that it allocates them out 
of a 64-bit word on 64-bit platforms?
cheers,
