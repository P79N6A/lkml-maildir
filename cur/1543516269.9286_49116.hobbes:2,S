Hi folks,
This is slightly OT but I thought only u kernel folks can answer this
better::
Hi,
I am just playing with the shadow file (after making copies :) and teh crypt
command..
Here is a simple sequence that I perform..::
useradd testme
passwd testme :: (passwd entered is testme2)
then look into the shadow file and see::
testme:$1$hI.ost8u$XZNxiISsD2ZuOrb6/Td3a/:10910:0:99999:7:-1:-1:134537888
then using a simple perl script..I do $passwd = crypyt("testme2","$1");
But the passwd I get is not the same as the one encoded in teh shadow
file...
what is going on..I thought using the passwd and the salt I should be
getting back to the same encrypted passwd..why is this happening..
something silly..???
Thx,
Arni
