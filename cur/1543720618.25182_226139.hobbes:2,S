Hi all,
I've checked the outdated faqs, searched through the archives and still
haven't found an answer to my simple question:
What is the latest stable kernel that I can run on a quad 125 MHz Ross
HyperSparc SPARCstation 20?
I'm currently running 2.2.22 and it has a kernel oops weekly with all 4 CPUs
installed. With 2 CPUs (either card- I've tested) it runs stable, if much
slower. Last I checked (back when 2.4 was new) 2.2 was it for sparc32. Is
this still the case?
Thanks for any help you can offer.
-Brad
