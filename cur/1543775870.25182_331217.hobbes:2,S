Hi Sven
I haven't tested 2.6.12.2 but the problem was introduced around 2.6.11-mm1 and
found its way to 2.6.12-rcX. First try to run the following command (this works for me)
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
I got an email from Juan Gallego (cc'd), he says that command does not work for him though.
Andrew,
Should I log this on the kernel's bugzilla?
Regards
/etc/sysctl.conf
