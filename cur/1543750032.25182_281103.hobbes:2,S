The problem is edonkey, you get all kinds of crap if you run
it or catch the IP of someone who did. Its about the biggest
sin for a network I've ever seen. The only funny part about
it are the crappy implementations, you just have to smile if
you see people do GUI refreshing in the UDP packet handler :)
