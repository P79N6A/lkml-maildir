Subject: 2.6.19-rc3-git7: Oops on shutdown: do_remount_sb (reiserfs)

The system is a Core2duo with SATA drives, with a SLES10 install,
and a linux-2.6.19-rc3-git7 kernel.  All I did was a fresh boot to
the gdm prompt, and then selected "reboot" from the menu.
Just as it was closing up shop, an Oops appeared on the screen.
I took a photo of it, and transcribed this portion (below).
The photograph is available on request.
