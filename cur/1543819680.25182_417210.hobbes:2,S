I'd still disagree with Andi regarding this point (but it's not a very 
important issue).
My main problem with his patch is still the way he did it - sending a 
patch reverting a recently included patch with neither discussion before 
the patch nor mentioning in the patch that it's a revert nor a Cc to the 
people involved with the patch.
