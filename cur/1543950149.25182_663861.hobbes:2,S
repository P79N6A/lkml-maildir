I propose and I could mentor two projects about automagical kernel
configuration:
- add support to menuconfig, to show what you should enable (not
really an automagical configuration, but more an helper which
know better(?) your hardware).
- new ideas about hardware/protocol detection and detection heuristics.
I've already done some parts: generating an hardware->kernel driver
database ( 
http://cateee.net/lkddb/
 ), and a working prototype of
autoconfiguration ( 
http://testing.cateee.net/autokernconf/
 ).
I really want to have new ideas and other developers. I think the
idea are appealing to students, and it doesn't requires a lot of
knowledge of kernel internal.
