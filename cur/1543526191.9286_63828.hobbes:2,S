Probable point where we call it being shrink_mmap(). Other candidates?

Ahem... OK, we can put the counter for dirty pages and put them into the
head of the ->pages.

Ouch. Now, that may turn out nasty - deadlocks are fun...
OK, let's do the simple stuff first - are you OK with per-address_space
->shrink_mapping() being called from shrink_mmap()?
