Hey folks,
I'm seeing a problem with mounting CDs using a Toshiba XM-6401TA CDROM
drive attached to an Adaptec AHA1542CF controller (scsi1) on kernel 2.4.3
and 2.4.4.  The behavior seems to be fairly consistent as follows:
first mount and unmount works normally, no unusual events logged
second mount and unmount works normally, no unusual events logged
third mount locks up the machine.  looks like a kernel panic.
Any ideas?
