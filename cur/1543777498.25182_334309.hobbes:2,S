Disclaimer - This is not proof of a real world dvd stuttering, simply a 
benchmarked result. My code may be crap, but then the real apps out there may 
also be.

Audio did show slightly larger max latencies but nothing that would be of 
significance.
On video, maximum latencies are only slightly larger at HZ 250, all the 
desired cpu was achieved, but the average latency and number of missed 
deadlines was significantly higher.
