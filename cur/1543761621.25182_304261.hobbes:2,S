So if you e.g. hotplug a new device, its partitions won't be
accessible before you (or some hotplug manager, etc.) run
"partition" ?

I guess, once you've reached the point where the kernel is
unable to find partitions without user-space help, you may
as well do everything in user space.

Pretty much, yes. Except for a few embedded systems (*), this
would mark the end of kernels that can do anything useful
without initrd or initramfs.
(*) Oh, regarding the other exception, ceterum censeo nfsroot

... and allow "partition" to override partitions previously
auto-detected by the kernel. That way, you can phase in
"partition" without needing to change your kernel setup.
Besides, the ability to correct past mistakes would also be
useful if auto-detection from user space yields garbage.
