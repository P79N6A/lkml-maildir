There is hwclock that will read or write the CMOS clock,
and it synchronizes.
So if one wants to synchronize with the CMOS clock (rather than, say,
with an external clock), and wants the better-than-1-sec accuracy,
then that can be done in a boot script.

[I think everybody likes fast boot time.
Ah - 30 years ago my system booted in the fraction of a second
needed to print the command prompt.
Why have computers become so slow?]
