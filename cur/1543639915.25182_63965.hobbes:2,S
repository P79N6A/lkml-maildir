Folks,
As indicated in other mailings, I have been looking at the pdc202xx driver.  
One 'issue' it has (in common with several other ide controller drivers) is
that while it exports a /proc entry that describes the configuration of the
controller, that entry only describes the first controller found. As I have 2
controllers in my machine (and it could be 3), that's not optimal.
I have been working on a patch to fix that. It is now in a state of
compiles-but-not-tested. Is there anyone who could have a look and see if it
ought to work? Once I have some confidence in it, I'll give it a go...
I am wary of testing it "blind" as I don't have a dedicated test machine, so
I'd prefer not to play fast and loose with my server :-)
Thanks,
Ruth
