Hopefully yes. Here's a bit more informative description:
After removal of fixup_cpu_present_map() function Alpha ended up
with an empty cpu_present_map, so secondary CPUs on SMP systems are
not being started.
Worse, on some platforms we route interrupts to secondary CPUs using
cpu_possible_map which is still populated properly. As a result,
these interrupts go nowhere so the machines like DP264 aren't able
to boot even with a primary CPU.
Fixed basically by s/cpu_present_mask/cpu_present_map/.
Ivan.
