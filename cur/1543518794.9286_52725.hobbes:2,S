Module loads ok, but when I attempt to play anything, no sound comes out.
lspci -v:
00:04.0 Multimedia audio controller: ESS Technology ES1978 Maestro
Audiodrive (rev 10)
        Subsystem: NEC Corporation: Unknown device 1978
        Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 5
        I/O ports at ec00 [size=256]
        Capabilities: [c0] Power Management version 2
when loading the module I get:
maestro: version 0.10 time 13:28:38 Dec 10 1999
maestro: Configuring ESS Maestro 2E found at IO 0xEC00 IRQ 5
maestro:  subvendor id: 0x80581033
maestro: AC97 Codec detected: v: 0x414b4d00 caps: 0x0 pwr: 0xf
maestro: 1 channels configured.
This is on an NEC Versa SX laptop.
If the .config is needed, I will send.
If at all possible, I'd like to get sound working as soon as I can.
Thanks.
