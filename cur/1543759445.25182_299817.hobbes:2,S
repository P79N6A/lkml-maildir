Mmm. But if we're both putting hooks in the same places...

The CPU save and restore, yes. But I use a different format for
recording the image metadata (I use bitmaps to record the locations of
pages). Perhaps I should hasten to mention the bitmaps are discontiguous
- single pages connected by a kmalloc'd list. The copyback itself will
need to stay distinct.
