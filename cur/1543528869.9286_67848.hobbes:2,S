Coders,
I am sure to loose a geek point for asking a question like the one below
but if you can CC me the answer at my email account, I would appricate it.
I have started working on my project for my Adv OS class. The basic part
of my project is a module that is communicated to via a /proc file entry.
In reading the LKMG, the examle modules (#3 specifically) user
proc_register() and proc_unregister() to create / uncreate the /proc
entry.
The problem is somewhere between 2.3.28 (my desktop) and 2.3.49 (my
development box)  proc_unregister is no longer available and proc_register
is not an exported symbol. 
My questions are: When did these two functions go away? and What is the
new method to add/remove /proc entries?
Thanks for any and all help.
Keith
