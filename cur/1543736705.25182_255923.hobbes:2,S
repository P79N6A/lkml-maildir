Unforch, I don't have a spare seriel port Ingo.  One is running my x10 
stuffs, and the other is monitoring my belkin ups.  The ups has a usb 
connection too, but belkins monitor soft doesn't support it...  They 
don't have a real strong support linux attitude, and they apparently 
do their linux development on a board with a broken usb1.0 interface, 
like my firewall box's Tyan Trinity S-1590 has.  It does mice ok, but 
hook up anything that can output more than a 5 byte packet and the 
machine is locked up instantly.
