I have now installed the latest rh-kernel. I have also tried the 2.4.18 kernel (There should be some fixes for Promise SX6000 there). And the firmware is the newest. But still the system hangs during booting. I get the following messages:
"""
Partition Check: 
i2o/hda: i2o/hda1 i2o/hda2 i2o/hda3 i2o/hda4 < i2o/hda5 i2o/hd6 >
Loading jbd module

pivotroot: pivot_root(/sysroot, /sysroot/initrd) failed: 2
Freeing unused kernel memory: 224k freed
Kernel panic: no init found.  Try pasing init= to kernel.
"""
There could be spelling-errors, but else it should be all right. I have not made any changes to the system. (pure rh-7.2 install)
