Yes, but I wanted to try 2.2.13pre15 as soon as possible.
There were three rejects, in ide.c. Two were for the spinlock (which therefore was not changed in pre15, I also checked it), the other was:

  	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&io_request_lock, flags);
  	do_hwgroup_request(hwgroup);
- 	save_flags(flags);	/* all CPUs; overkill? */
- 	cli();			/* all CPUs; overkill? */
  	if (action == ide_wait)
  	{
  		down(&sem);	/* wait for it to be serviced */
  		rq->sem = NULL;
  	}
- 	restore_flags(flags);	/* all CPUs; overkill? */
  	return rq->errors ? -EIO : 0;	/* return -EIO if errors */
  }

  	}
  	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&io_request_lock, flags);
  	do_hwgroup_request(hwgroup);
  	if (action == ide_wait)
  	{
  		down(&sem);	/* wait for it to be serviced */
  		rq->sem = NULL;
  	}
  	return rq->errors ? -EIO : 0;	/* return -EIO if errors */
  }
  
I.e.: In the kernel I tested, the "/* all CPUs; overkill? */" lines are still there, and "rq->sem = NULL;" is missing. Please tell me if you believe that any of these is a problem.
Anyway, that kernel was the one that survived longest (6 hours, until it had a NULL pointer dereference). My 2.2.13pre15 without UnifiedIDE locked up hard after 4 hours. The pre15 kernel with UnifiedIDE was not less reliable, but perhaps more.
>If you got any "fuzz" or single line rejects.......
No fuzz, just a few small offsets. Besides the above rejects your 2.2.13pre14 patch applies cleanly to pre15.
