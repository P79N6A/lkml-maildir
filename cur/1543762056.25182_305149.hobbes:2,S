These indicate minor differences in these files between upstream BK
(which is what my patch was against) and the kernel you're building.
You can ignore them.

Great.  Shaohua, where should we go from here?  Do you have more
concerns with the current patch, or should we ask Andrew to put it
in -mm?  If you do have concerns, would you like to propose an
alternate patch that fixes the problem for Grzegorz?

I don't know about the above messages, but I don't think they're
related to the Via quirk we're working on at the moment.  Probably
some mismatch between the kernel you built and the modules.
