I know Linux will never be compiled with any other thing than gcc. But
what I do not understand is why if there is a standard C way of doing
something you have to use an strange extension of gcc.
Same happens with 'return' and 'break'. You type the same to add a
'/* DO NOT REMEMBER THE PRECISE COMMENT */' to shut up the compiler
instead of just writing
case X:
	...
	return xxx;
	break;
???
Size optimization for the couple of bytes of the jump in return or break ?
