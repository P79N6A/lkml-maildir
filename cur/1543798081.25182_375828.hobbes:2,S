This all looks excellent to me.  Just FYI - If you want to get rid of the
rdmsr and just use the PCI header, you can also get the IO base of the 
GPIO registers from BAR1 of the DIVIL device.   Not a big deal,
but some people like to stay away from MSR accesses if they can avoid it.
Thanks for your hard work - its good to see Geode users pop up in the
community! :)
