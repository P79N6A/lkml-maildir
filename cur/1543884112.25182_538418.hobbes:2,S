WRONG!
I offered a patch for the broken floppy, but Linus was faster and ripped the whole section out, so do not even try to misunderstand or quote me out of context!
So I say it again:
The theses Mr. Chehab invents NOT TO DO SOMETHING do never carry fully transparent information with them. It's just air bubbles that he is producing, nothing else!
It's always and ever the other part that is exposed to offer transparent info, but never Chehab himself!
And it's exactly the same thing with Abraham or Krufky!
And does that behaviour conform with democratic terms? NO WAY!
So there are three mismatches around: Their names are: Abraham, Krufky, and Chehab!
