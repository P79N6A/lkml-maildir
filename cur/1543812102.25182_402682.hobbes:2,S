The times() function gets me the system/user CPU usage of me (invoking
process) and all my terminated/waited children.
Is there any User Space API/way for me (a process) to get the
system/user CPU usage of one of my currently running child process? Am
looking for a portable solution...not sure if there is any
Thanks,
Arijit
