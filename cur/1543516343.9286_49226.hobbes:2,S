Hi all,
the Demolinux project (
http://www.demolinux.org
) is designing CDs that can
boot and run Linux all from a CD-Rom. As the capacity of a CD is quite
limited, it was thought a good idea to use ext2 on-the-fly compression.
Two methods have been tried:
- a big file on an ISO-9660 filesystem stored on the CD-Rom, containing an
  ext2fs+compression partition;
- two partitions on the CD-Rom, the second of which is ext2fs+compression.
Both methods do work, but extremely slowly (6 minutes to load Netscape,
for instance).
The problem is tricky, since doing the same but with the ext2 partition in
a file on an ext2fs hard drive partition yields fast access times.
We suspect some bad interaction between e2compr and the CD-Rom layer;
perhaps e2compr accesses the filesystem in patterns the CD-Rom driver is
not optimized for.
Has anybody got ideas on this?
Regards,
