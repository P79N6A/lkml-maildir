I was wondering ;)  BFS users aren't common.  Thanks for the fixes.
For future reference: we prefer that an individual patch not do more than
one thing.  So it would have been preferable to present this work as a
sequence of patches.
Probably the high-priority patches (ie: bugfixes) should be the earlier
patches in a case like this.  Because then we can backport the fix into
2.6.23 and maybe 2.6.22 with some confidence.  Also, separating out the
cleanups for the bugfixes makes it easier for people to review and
understand the bugfixes.
Still, that's a minor detail compared to getting a filesystem bug fixed so
I merged your change as-is, thanks
