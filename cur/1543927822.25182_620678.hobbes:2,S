This is not about netfilter, but about freeing skb in interrupt context, 
which is not allowed, and in interrupt skbs are queued to be freed in softirq,
but netcnsole wants to flush softirq freeing queue. That is a question: why?
Removing zap_completion_queue() from find_skb() will fix the warning,
but I'm not sure this is a correct fix. I've added Matt to the Cc list.
