Hi,
I experience the following problem which occurs randomly.
After a reboot, the Bootsector is often corrupted. The errors reported 
by lilo differ.
Today I had 99 (invalid second stage index sector).
The problem occurs both on cold and on warm boots.
Re-installing lilo helps (until the next corruption).
I have a 2.4.20 kernel but the probelem occurs since many kernel revisions.
My MoBo is a Gigabyte GA-5AA which is an AT sized ATX board with an ATX 
power supply. It has an ALI1543 chipset.
APM is active, ACPI isn't.
The relevant boot messages are:
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 6.31
ide: Assuming 33MHz system bus speed for PIO modes; override with idebus=xx
ALI15X3: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 78

using pci=biosirq.

The CD burner is used via ide-scsi:

   Type:   CD-ROM                             ANSI SCSI revision: 02
which seems to have some (small) problems which do not affect the 
functionality (burning works flawlessly):

Any help is greatly appreciated.
