in 2.4 & Xeons we can do more than 100,000 context switches/second, and
that is more than enough. But the point is: network IO performance does
not depend on context switching speed too much. Also, in Linux we are
using global pages which makes kernel-space TLBs persistent even across
CR3 flushes.

we do not use the fs segment register for user-space copies anymore,
neither in 2.2, nor in 2.4. You must be reading old books and probably
forgot to cross-check with the kernel source? :-)

the worst thing you can do is to mis-identify performance problems and
spend braincells on the wrong problem. The problems limiting Linux network
scalability have been identified during the last 12 months by a small
team, and solved in TUX. TUX is a fileserver, it shouldnt be alot of work
to enable it for (TCP-only?) netware serving. It's *done*, Jeff, it's not
a hypotetical thing, it's here, it works and it performs.
