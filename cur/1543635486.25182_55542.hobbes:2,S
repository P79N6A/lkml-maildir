Hey, thanks Rik, I know something about that :-)  And I'd be testing right
now to see if you're right, if the DAC960 driver compiled successfully.
But it doesn't, and since my test machine won't boot without it... given a
choice between diving into the driver and going back to work on directory
hashing on 2.4...
The tree that builds wins this time.

I bet it's something a lot dumber, like a memory leak.
