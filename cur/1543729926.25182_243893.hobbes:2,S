Seems like an anything-at-all-other-than-IRQ-10 problem. If the current 
thinking is right, your BIOS is assigning IRQ10 during boot, so moving 
it anywhere else is what causes problems.
But the current thinking doesn't quite seem right, because it seeems 
like we're seeing these problems after the irqrouter is resumed. Can you 
verify that with the attached patch? The patch should give us enough 
information as long as you've got the proper kernel loglevel set.
Now, I wonder if the only reason it works when you set IRQ 10 is that 
some other driver is unconditionally claiming the interrupt...

pci_disable_device() only turns off bus-mastering, it doesn't unmap the 
I/O or disable the slot. Maybe we also need to set power state D3 and do 
a device-specific disable-interrupts, but I think D0 gets restored for 
us pretty early during resume anyway...
Anyway, something doesn't quite add up...
