Hello,
   I am porting some checkpoint/restart code from intel to alpha, and have
run into a bit of a jam.  I am not sure what the question should be, so
I'll describe the circumstances.
A system call is defined as:
static inline _syscall1 (int, restart, char*, filename);
and then written as:
asmlinkage int sys_restart (struct pt_regs regs)
{...
Is it correct to assume on all architectures that one could cast the first
arg to a syscall as a 'struct pt_regs'?  The author also does it here:
static inline _syscall3 (int, checkpoint, int, pid, int, fd, int, flags);
and then:
asmlinkage int sys_checkpoint (struct pt_regs regs)
{...
Also, when restarting the image, he copies the old regs right into &regs.
So, I am assuming this is the task's saved stack.
So, I guess the question I have is will this work across platforms?  I know
for the alpha one also has to restore the switch_stack.  How about the usp?
Should that be saved and restored ([rd,wr]usp)?
If it helps, the restart system call replaces the caller with the
checkpointed image, similar to exec.
Any help you could provide would be greatly appreciated.
