Sorry, but no, we're not.  The exact time measurement for a year
is 365.24219878... days.  We round that off to 365.25 for conveininece
to get a leap day every four years.  However, the decimal is less
than .25, so after 100 years, we end up ahead.  Thus centuries
are not supposed to be leap years normally, in order to "down correct"
for the .25 estimate.  Now, the part .00219878... remaining, works
out to be an extra day every 400 years.
Thus the rule is leap years come when the year is divisible by 4,
but not centuries, unless divisible by 400.  This keeps the calendar
correct for a few thousand years.
Year 2000 happens to be one of those centuries that is a leap year.
Thus it has 29 days, since ordinary centuries would only have 28.
