When we are talking about OSS, we are talking about what is under 
sound/oss/ in the kernel sources.
The commercial OSS might be much better, but it's not relevant since 
it's not GPL'ed and therefore not a candidate for inclusion into the 
kernel.
As you said yourself, the "GPL'ed OSS is abandoned".
And ALSA is it's successor in the kernel.
