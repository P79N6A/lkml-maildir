Hello,
i have a ICP-Vortex SCSI-Hostadapter (GDT-3000B, EISA)
I try to reserve a Fujitsu MO-Device (M2513) at SCSI-ID 4 
as a scsi-raw device.
The 'append-line' at '/etc/lilo.conf'
-------------------------------------
append="gdth=disable:N,rescan:Y,reserve_list:0,0,4,0,hdr_channel:0
-------------------------------------
Kernel 2.0.36/37 works well:
'cat /proc/scsi/scsi' (from 2.0.37):
-------------------------------------
Attached devices: 
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: ICP      Model: Host Drive  #00  Rev:     
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00
  Vendor: ICP      Model: Host Drive  #01  Rev:     
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 01 Id: 04 Lun: 00
  Vendor: FUJITSU  Model: M2513E           Rev: 0060
  Type:   Optical Device                   ANSI SCSI revision: 02
  
  
I do not change anything at my hardware. 
I just boot kernel 2.2.10 with the same lilo-configuration.
'cat /proc/scsi/scsi' (from 2.2.10):
-------------------------------------
Attached devices: 
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 00 Lun: 00
  Vendor: ICP      Model: Host Drive  #00  Rev:     
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
Host: scsi0 Channel: 00 Id: 01 Lun: 00
  Vendor: ICP      Model: Host Drive  #01  Rev:     
  Type:   Direct-Access                    ANSI SCSI revision: 02
------------------------------------
The reserved MO-device from lilo-configuration is not present.
One aspect is importent, maybe:
The messages in '/proc/scsi/gdth/0' (directly from the controller)
are the same, whether kernel 2.0.36/37 or kernel 2.2.10 is running.
They shows the correct informations:
'cat /proc/scsi/gdth/0' (kernel 2.0.36/37 and kernel 2.2.10):

I have spoken to the support-team from ICP-Vortex many times.
They do not have any solutions for this problem.
It looks so, that it is not a problem of the gdth-driver.
So my question is, could this behavior belong to the SCSI-code at 2.2.x ? 
Note: The Motherboard has EISA/PCI - bus and 2xpentium 200 (smp).
Do someone else have trouble with Kernels 2.2.x and EISA-Controllers,
especially from ICP-Vortex?
Note: This email to the kernel mailinglist is my last idea, to get 
some help solving this problem.
Thank you in advance,
Andreas.
