In this case, POSIX defines select() / blocking read() to be useful.
Linux defines it to be dangerous.
I have no question in my mind which behaviour is 'correct', in this
case. Deciding between something that works, and something that doesn't,
is a no brainer for me. Talking about performance, and so on, is just a
complete distraction. Who cares about performance when a percentage of
the time the caller will be in a confused state as a result?
I'm ok with case-by-case. I'm not ok with a generic "POSIX sucks lots -
why should we be POSIX compliant?"
Cheers,
mark
