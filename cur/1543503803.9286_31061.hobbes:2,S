At a 48KHz sample rate, a 0.2ms flange is slightly under 10
samples. If you specify a fragment size of 16 (just for the power-of-2
fan club), that translates to 4800 interrupts a second from the
soundcard just to say "i crossed a fragment boundary". I didn't see
any posts to linux-kernel that really answered the question "how many
cycles are burnt handling a timer interrupt", but I have a pretty good
feeling that Linux wasn't meant to run well with a regular 4.8KHz
interrupt rate from something requiring an interrupt handler as
relatively complex as the typical DAC handler.

the PC speaker, as I recall, doesn't talk back to you. You have no
idea of fragment boundary crossings. this won't work for real DAC's.

Yes, but thats not a realistic example of what an FX unit does. You've
got to copy data from the DAC output buffer into the host memory and
back again. Believing that you can do this *and* the FX computation
*and* run other things seems wrong to me. 
I also don't understand the appeal of using RTL for this, other than
"it works" and "its not windows or macos" ...

All understood. But you're missing something here. I mentioned that my
measurements said that 99% of the write()'s to the soundcard complete
within 0.05ms of the specified time. Moreover, if you use ALSA (which
properly allows non-blocking I/O to the ADAC), you'll find that the
actual system call takes only 2-5 microseconds (on a PII-450). That
means that in almost every case (on a quiescent system), your task
*does* get scheduled in time. 
If you now add in SCHED_FIFO for the relevant thread, it is
essentially *guaranteed* to be scheduled to run after the ADAC
interrupts us to say that it just crossed a fragment boundary. 
So, we're almost there ... well, no, because as Benno's benchmark
demonstrates, even though its scheduled to run, it can't because the
update thread is busy with the page cache. Sigh.

Let me try to be precise in my usage of the terms:
    latency: the constant delay between the generation of an audio
             sample and its effect on the analog or digital output 
	     of an audio device. caused almost entirely by the
	     fragment size requested by the application, and limited
	     only by the h/w's minimum fragment size and maximum
	     CPU throughput.
    jitter: variation in the delay between sample generation and sample	     
            output from the audio device caused by the host CPU.

Not if its SCHED_FIFO. If you wire down its pages (mlockall(2)), and
there are no other SCHED_FIFO tasks, only interrupt servicing can get
in your way. If you don't believe me, try running:
     while (1) { }
as a SCHED_FIFO task. Your system will appear to hang, but its really
just exceedingly busy :)
Now, interrupt servicing is clearly a problem, but what are you
proposing ? That we *don't* service an interrupt in a timely fashion ?
This is one of the reasons dedicated FX units work so reliably at low
latencies: they have no "other interrupts".
