Yes, that look like exactly what would be wanted.  It would be nice
if such a message was available in the regular, non-encrypted protocol.

Heh. Yes, well, I still haven't figured out how to secure DNS. Yet clearly
this whole security mess must march on, and somehow the security
infrastructure must eventually become easy to install.

Yes.

Actually, this is rather sorely lacking in 'gory details', rather, its
a complaint
that 'things don't work' with no discussion of the actual problem.  It would
be much better if there was a link to any previous discussions on LKML on
this issue.
My knee-jerk reaction on reading about the lost-interrupts issue is that,
yes, setting HZ=100 and disabling ACPI is indeed a decent short-term
work-around (APIC is something completely different and not something
you can disable). The correct long-term solution would be to use real-time
kernels, which are designed to make sure that things like lost interrupts
never happen.
I have no idea what the status of real-time Linux is, whether it would now
have gaurantees for timer ticks, and whether anything there would now
be mergeable into the mainline kernel.
