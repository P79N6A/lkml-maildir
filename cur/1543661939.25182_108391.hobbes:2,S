The file level is worthless IMHO, you have no idea of what is going on
in the I/O queue from there, the queue can be filled with 64M in some
msec. If you really thing the above can be nearly as good at SFQ at the
queue level, implement your alternate solution, benchmark it against SFQ
with a seeking tiotest 1 with a cp /dev/zero .  in background, if it
works better than SFQ we'll use it.
