Right, OTOH this someone might also just use the primary address
as prefsrc and would welcome a translation to the new address
instead of a silent deletion. Nevertheless, I agree with deleting
and readding the local routes (for now ;-) while I keep this in
mind for later improvement.

Interesting, do you use an iproute2 version with the wildcard
address deletion fix attached below?
