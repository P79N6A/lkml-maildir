Priority Inheritance has come up a couple of times in relation to Ingo's new 
LightWeight Robust Futexes.  Ingo has said that PI is orthogonal to LWRF, but I 
don't think we've heard if there are plans already in the works (or in his head 
:-) for PI.  Rusty's comment above reads as "the current LWRF implementation 
cannot support PI" - is there something about it that makes PI impractical to 
implement?
