ACPI was disabled and it's hard to say where the modules hung. I have no 
oopses in log. For first i lost mouse after end of synchronization with 
palm (same samtimes happend with 2.4 kernels). I tried to unload and load 
all usb modules (it restarts USB and help on 2.4). But after exec rmmod 
visor the rmmod process stay in D state and all attempts to work with 
modules (lsmod) too. At last i shutdown and reboot back to 2.4.
I tried uhci instead of usb-uhci and for the present all is OK.
