Looks good to me.  It's at least as good as "make SUBDIRS=fs/qnx4".
My experience with Makefiles and speed is that when I write things to
be correct they also become faster.  So don't worry about speed too
much because you will probably get a lot of it "for free".
For example, did you notice how the stock Rules.make recurses *twice*
for each directory level it enters?
