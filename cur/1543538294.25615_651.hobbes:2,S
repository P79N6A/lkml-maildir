It's much better to not have a pile of ugly #ifdef's. I strongly
recommend ripping them out. That's why I have the stub functions in
the first place.
For those drivers which do have #ifdef's, it's usually because the
same driver codebase is maintained for 2.2.x and 2.3.x kernels, and
2.2.x doesn't have the header file. I've asked Alan to include the
header so that drivers don't need these ugly #ifdef's, but he doesn't
seem to care.
