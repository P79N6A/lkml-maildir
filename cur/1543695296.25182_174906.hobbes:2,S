I had a spare couple of hours this evening, so I whipped up a patch of my
own to actually fix the thing, working from first principles and tracing
through yacc and lexx code at one point.
With the benefit of hindsight, it turns out the other patch wasn't actually
that far off.  I only noticed that just now, I had to figure out how mconf.c
was shelling out to lxdialog and getting data back on stderr first to
realize that yes, printing stuff to stderr is in fact an important part of
getting this to work. :)
Here's the fix.  Go to into "processor type and features" from the main
menu, then the "subarchitecture" menu at the top of that, and notice the
entries in it now have help options.
