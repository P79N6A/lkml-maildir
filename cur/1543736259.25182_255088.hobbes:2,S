Here it is:
(lspci -n)
00:02.0 Class 0c03: 10b9:5237 (rev 03)
(lspci -v)
00:02.0 USB Controller: ALi Corporation USB 1.1 Controller (rev 03)
(prog-if 10 [OHCI])
	Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company: Unknown device 0850
	Flags: bus master, medium devsel, latency 64, IRQ 10
	Memory at d4000000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
	Capabilities: [60] Power Management version 2
So I made it strictly specific to this hardware vendor PCI_VENDOR_ID_AL
(0x10b9) and device PCI_DEVICE_ID_AL_M5237 (0x5237).
The attached patch applies now to ohci_pci.c and it just works for me (tm:)
Thanks for the suggestion Ingo.
I feel better now.
