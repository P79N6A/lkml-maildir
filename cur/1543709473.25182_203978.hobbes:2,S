while wholeheartly agreeing with you in this statement, I had to compile
modules with remove enabled for a show-stopping reason: suspend. After
resume, sound, usb mouse, pcmcia devices would not come back to life if I do
not rmmod before and reload after going to S4. I quite understand that this
is a driver problem (bug?), but for my notebook module remove is a necessary
workaround.
