This device is behaving quite like the 440MX chipset
I have myself I can't therefore the oops expect beeing caused
by a trivial programming error in the actual ide driver.
I don't see much pointer acces in piix.c code as well.
However you could eventually just try apply the following
pseudo diff to piix.c and then try again:
- 
{ PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AA_1,	PIIX_UDMA_66  | PIIX_PINGPONG },
+ 
{ PCI_DEVICE_ID_INTEL_82801AA_1,	PIIX_UDMA_66 },
Replaceing PIIX_UDMA_33 with PIIX_UDMA_33 could be worth a try as well.
