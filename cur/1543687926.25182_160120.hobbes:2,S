Well, here it is:
static int __init
acx100_probe_pci(struct pci_dev *pdev, const struct pci_device_id *id)
Please report this to the ACX people as a bug - the probe function must
/not/ be marked as __init.  If they want them to be discarded if hotplug
is disabled, they must be marked as __devinit.  However, in 2.6 kernels,
they must not be marked as __init nor __devinit in any case.
