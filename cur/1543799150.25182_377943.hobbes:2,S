Right. Which is why the _correct_ fix is certainly to just initialize the 
core functionality early.
So the fix is certainly _usable_ (and simple, and guaranteed to not break 
anything, which is why it's fine 2.6.15 material), but I certainly agree 
that a much better fix would be for a sound core person to walk through 
the subsystem initializers, and just mark _those_ early instead.
Hint hint ;)
