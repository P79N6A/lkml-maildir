Subject: get_pid() performance fix

Paul Larson posted a patch which fixes the get_pid() hang,
if we run out of available pids. Nevertheless, we have
observed that it takes a long time to find the next available
pid once the last pid reaches the PID_MAX. This is due to
a constant rescan of the task list while progressing only one
pid at time, yielding an O(n**2) problem.
Here is a patch (together with Paul's fix) which eliminates the
time taken to search for an available pid, by not constantly
restarting the search through the entire task list.
Attached is also a user level test program getpid.c),
by which one can simulate creation and deletion of processes.
This application will measure the time taken for the get_pid()
routine to find the next available process.
example:
      getpid -p 32770 -n 3
which will try to create 32770 process, eventually get_pid can't
find any free pid after 32767, so it will delete 3 pids randomly
from the existing list and start calculating the time taken to
find the available pid (which we deleted).
In getpid.c the new fixes  are inside the #define NEW_METHOD.
Try compiling the getpid.c with and without -DNEW_METHOD compile
option to see the performance improvement.
here is an example output for the old and the new algorithm and
their respective execution time to find a new pid.
(See attached file: output)
This can/should be applied to 2.5 and 2.4 kernels.
(See attached file: getpid.c)
Thanks,
Rajan
