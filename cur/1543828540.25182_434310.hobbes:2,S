Eh?  The vast majority of ISA bus devices have open-collector IRQ lines,
which means that two devices on the same IRQ are "wire-ORed" (but they really
use edges).  There's no problem whatsoever with this in most setups.
I even implemented full support for it in the Linux IDE driver, way back when,
so that multiple cards could be installed on the same IRQ, and would work
just fine so long as access was serialized.  This was the one of the original
motivations for the IDE "serialize=" parameter.
Cheers
