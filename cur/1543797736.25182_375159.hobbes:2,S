There's no downside, really.  It just places the storage into a different
section.  There's a small downside to having __read_mostly at all: up to a
page more memory used.  But once it's there, adding to it is just moving
things around in memory.
__read_mostly is simply a new (page-aligned) section into we put things
which are considered to not be written to very often.

Not at this stage - it'd be better if someone did a big sweep and changed
all kmem_cache_t's in one hit.
