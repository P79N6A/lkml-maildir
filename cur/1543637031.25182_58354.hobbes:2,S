Really?  Cool, I wonder where I got the idea it wasn't...
Even so, I can't figure out how to backport from 2.5 to 2.4 without
using patches (but Larry's smarter than I am, he might know how).
Cherry picking would only solve part of the problem, the independent
creation of what is logically the same file is a bigger problem.
Instead of making "stable" changes to the 2.4 tree and pulling them
into the dev tree, they've been independently applied to both trees.
Development on 2.4 and 2.5 would have to be more coordinated with each
other than it is right now to really take advantage of the ability to
push/pull between 2.4 and 2.5.
