As promised, here is more information on the CDR-writing problem I've 
been having with 2.2.16. ATAPI CDR using SCSI-generic compiled in, also
an Adaptec AIC7895 with a couple of hard disks on, also compiled in. The
system is SMP (dual P2) and the kernel is patched with the new i2c and
lm_sensors patches, also the international kernel and secure-linux patch.
This didn't use to happen with previous kernels but I'm not sure which 
the last kernel I successfully wrote a CD with was.
The CDR and the CD-ROM both read CDs okay.
If I can provide more information let me know (it'll be next weekend now
though...)
