we found substantial improvements (around 20% )in Database decision
support work load on Filesystems.
To address your concern regarding possible SDET regression generated by
this patch, we (Steve Pratt) ran a bunch of regression tests on
2.6.0test5-mm2(with and without the patch). I have pasted the results of
SDET and Kernel Bench. We did not find any noticable performance
regression.
Here are some results from Steve on test5-mm2
