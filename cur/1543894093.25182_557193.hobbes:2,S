Yes, now the "loop" devices are dynamically allocated.... a patch to
provide the 8 "static allocated" loop devices is already in current git
(post -rc4, will be in -rc5).

    loop: preallocate eight loop devices
    The kernel on-demand loop device instantiation breaks several user space
    tools as the tools are not ready to cope with the "on-demand feature".  Fix
    it by instantiate default 8 loop devices and also reinstate max_loop module
    parameter.
