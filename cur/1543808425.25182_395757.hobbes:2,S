Subject: [RFC/PATCH: 000/010] Memory hotplug for new nodes with pgdat allocation.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Hello.
I'll post newest patches for memory hotadd.
In this this patch, pgdat is allocated when new node is comming.
To initialize pgdat and zones, a set of patches are necessary.
  - to allcate and initialize pgdat, zone, zonelist.
  - to initialize node_data[] array (ia64)
  - to register sysfs file for new node.
  - to call memory_hotplug code from acpi container driver.
Note:
 - kmalloc is used for pgdat allocation in this version.
   So, even if pgdat is allocated, it will be allocated on the other node.
   This is only to simplify patches a bit. :-P
 - register sysfs file for new node is just for ia64.
   I hacked quickly for x86_64, but x86_64 doesn't use sysfs file
   for node. So, I gave up at least this week.....
This patches are for 2.6.16-rc2-mm1.
Please comment.
Thanks.
