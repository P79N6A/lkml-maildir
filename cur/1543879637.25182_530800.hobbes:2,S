I have been diligently putting the spam emitters into my .procmailrc file, so 
that anything that comes from them goes to /dev/null.
This included mailbag1.bizmailsrvcs.net and mailbag2.bizmailsrvcs.net.
The linux kernel mailing list disappeared!  Turning on VERBOSE and watching 
the procmail.log with tail disclosed that it was triggering on those 2 mail 
servers, which I thought had nothing to do with vger.kernel.org
I've removed them from by procmail recipes now, but I'd sure like to know 
wtf's going on.  These 2 servers are a major source of incoming spam 
according to the headers of the spams received.

That's easy to fix, but I can't be bothered.
