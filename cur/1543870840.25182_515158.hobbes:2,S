I still don't understand why "the backup program flushed my data out
of the cache with POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED" is an improvement over "the
backup program flushed my data out of the cache by reading other files".
Your code may be useful for a few specialized situations, but I don't
see it actually fixing most of the examples you gave in your
announcement, except for the DVD copying one.
