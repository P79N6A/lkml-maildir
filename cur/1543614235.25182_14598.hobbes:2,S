Would you mind to give us a short hint on the implicit "instability" you are
exactly talking about? I think 2.4.17 is in various ways well worked out and
maintained. There are further improvements possible for sure, but that is a
normal thing. Anyway I cannot really see any major instability issues that
require instant brainstorming. I am confident in Marcelo's maintenance.
