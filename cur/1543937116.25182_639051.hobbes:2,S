Unfortunately, this issue has not been fully fixed yet.
My last attempt (
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/15/202
) to solve
this problem has a couple of drawbacks:
1) calling a possibly sleeping function from atomic context -
I've already corrected this;
2) there's a very special case with retouching the memory-mapped data
after a call to msync() with MS_ASYNC.
I'm still working on the latter case, but I guess that I have found a solution.
If you badly need a quick fix, I can send my working unreleased patch to you.
I reckon that your particular problem will be fixed by this patch.
Let me know if you want that.
However, if your application calls msync() with the MS_ASYNC flag,
it's better to wait a little bit more - I'll release the next version
of my solution
shortly.
