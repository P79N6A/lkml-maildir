So you keep saying, but you refcount objects that are going away, you
don't need to refcount objects that are staying put.

Doesn't occur in the 2.4 situation or the 2.6 stuff with the locking in
the 2.6.8.1-ac patch.

Oh dear then I guess most of Linux is misdesigned. You aren't thinking
about the semantics at all. 
If /dev/hda is a CD-ROM drive I can issue commands to it with no CD 
present. Thats not a layering violation, and its how the IDE code works.
So whats the difference between hotplugging a drive and removing
a CD. Both are removing the media but leaving the controller behind.
On that item I think you are talking out of your backside.

unregister is hot plug controller not drive and thats unfixable in 2.4

yeah that lot postdates the 2.4 work. hotplug drives is not the cause
however.

No it does not. The block layer couldn't give a flying **** whether
/dev/hda disappears or not. SCSI devices that are offlined don't need to
disappear either you just hand back commands with an error. You know -
like every CD-ROM does...

Ditto...
