1) You must not export jiffies to userspace.
2) They are not a time, they are a counter, and they do wrap.
3) This does not handle the settimeofday case: you need to check in
   userspace for that anyway.
So, since you need to check if you're trying to sleep for longer than
(say) 49 days, AND you need to check if you are after the given
abstime in userspace anyway (settimeofday backwards), you might as
well convert to relative in userspace.
Sorry,
Rusty.
