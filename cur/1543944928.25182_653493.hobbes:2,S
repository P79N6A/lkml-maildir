ok, Arjan found the bug: it was that idle threads didnt have their 
canary set up right.
[ note that this is still not complete because the initial idle thread
  still has a zero canary. But it at least boots now. ]

Subject: x86: setup stack canary for the idle threads
From: Arjan van de Ven <arjan@linux.intel.com>
The idle threads for non-boot CPUs are a bit special in how they
are created; the result is that these don't have the stack canary
set up properly in their PDA. Easiest fix is to just always set
the PDA up correctly when entering the idle thread; this is a NOP
for the boot cpu.
