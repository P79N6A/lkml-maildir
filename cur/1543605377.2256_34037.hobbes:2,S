I was not specific enough. I intended to say that Linus code was ok.
And that if so_far -= BUFSIZE ever was something different from
zero you would need to move the read bytes too...
This code not using continue is probably easier to read...
(+ error checking...)
  	unsigned int so_far = 0;
  	for (;;) {
  		int bytes = read(in, buf+so_far, BUFSIZE-so_far);
  		if (bytes <= 0)
  			break;
  		so_far += bytes;
 		if (so_far == BUFSIZE) {
	  		write(out, buf, BUFSIZE);
 			so_far = 0;
		}
  	}
  	if (so_far)
  		write(out, buf, so_far);
