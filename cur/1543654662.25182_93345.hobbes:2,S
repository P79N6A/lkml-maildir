Tried with fat32 and found no problems, everything is okay in this case.

To test for the bug I used the following command:
    find /misc/summer | tee /dev/tty | wc
in most cases I didn't see the output of wc, but two times I managed to
(in this cases `find' managed to terminate before the system hung).
24849 files, 1712874 total characters (in filenames)
25087 files, 1737450 characters

Sorry for misinforming you. When this was written I tried manual
mounting only once and all was okay during this trial. But when
I repeated the test, the system crashed as in the case of automounting.
And I didn't manage to perform a succesful find over ntfs volume once
more. So the problem here is probably in the ntfs driver, not autofs.

This applies to cdrom case. Just tested it. I.e. the system doesn't
crash when I invoke xmms with a playlist referring to nonexistent cd.

Tried different combinations. Does not matter.

It varies so I'm including several snapshots:
