Hi David,
You might be sounding a bit too abrasive here... I understand you're
also trying to help, but your tone just might be taken the wrong way.
Antonie is really doing the right thing here to test such a new feature
early and on the code he cares about as a user. And most importantly,
reporting it here. This is probably the most useful resource we have in
Linux.
Maybe the workload is quirky, but regardless, if it is a *regression*
from a previous kernel then it is really important to be brought to our
attention.
