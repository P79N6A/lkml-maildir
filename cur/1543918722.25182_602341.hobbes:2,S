A few points come to mind looking at Jan's patch:
The comment about nested pagetable locks is wrong: mm/mremap.c does
nest pagetable locks; but you wouldn't (as I understand it) be doing
this pinning/unpinning anywhere which could race with an mremap() on
the same mm, so that's a niggle about a comment, not a real issue.
Yes, it would be greatly preferable to take the locks one by one
as needed.  As it stands, I think you're in danger of overflowing
the PREEMPT_BITS 8 area of preempt_count(), venturing into the
SOFTIRQ area: I don't know the real-life consequence of that.
I don't see any protection against hugetlb areas, where the pmd
entry may indicate a hugetlb page rather than a pagetable page.
I guess you'll be needing to test pte_huge().  I don't know if
you want to lock those or skip them: locking is usually just
with page_table_lock, but beware there's also sharing of huge
page pmds between mms - Ken Chen should be able to help on that.
If a 2.6.23 fix is needed, I suggest simply excluding split ptlocks
in the Xen case, as shown by the mm/Kconfig - line in Jan's patch.
