I have CABLE MODEM connection and I have aout 40 kbps speed from ftp.krenel.org 
I think it is not so slow ;-))), I get linux kernel archive in 10 minutes ;)

I tried download from different places. So, it doesn't work.
As I said before in my posts, I suspect my RAM SIMM's (thanks to kernel hackers which gave me a lot of help)
So, I have to test it and I will know whats going wrong.

I think that this is problem with BIG tar.gz files, because if I try to ungzip 
kernel 2.2.19 everything goes fine, so it must be a hardware problem.
Thanks a lot for your help
