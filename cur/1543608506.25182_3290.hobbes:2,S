Actually I worry more about those programs that are already compiled and will 
break when the kernel changes. But even if you recompile the code, how can 
you be sure that the programmer uses longs instead of ints for those 64 bit 
types? The C compiler allows the implicit conversion without warning. If you 
change the type the program has to be changed, no matter what you do.

BTW nobody says to one-value-files can not have types (see my earlier posts 
in this thread).
