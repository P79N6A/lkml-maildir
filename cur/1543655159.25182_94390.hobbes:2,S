Hi Adrian,

It is broken, as tms_isa_probe() doesn't work on uninitialized dev
structs.
Try either of these for a correct fix:
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0211.0/0111.html
http://www.uwsg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0211.1/0537.html
(this one misses the change in Space.c though).
Currently, i can't do any newer patches as module loading is totally
broken on Alpha with later kernel versions.
Cheers,
