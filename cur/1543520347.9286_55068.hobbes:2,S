hi !
I have a parallel port IOMEGA ZIP drive.
It use the ppa modulei
All was Ok with kernel releases up to  2.3.31.
With 2.3.32 come a problem :
If compile ppa (and the scsi stuff) as a module and I try modprobe ppa,
it stay in a "initializing" state.
If it (and the other required scsi stuff) is built in the kernel, the
system stops after the following messages:
Dec 22 17:42:44 debian kernel: scsi0 : Iomega VPI0 (ppa) interface 
Dec 22 17:42:44 debian kernel: scsi : 1 host. 
My system is Debian 2.1 with :
- Kernel modutils        2.3.7
- Gnu C                  2.7.2.3
- Binutils               2.9.5
- Linux libc5 C Library  5.4.46
- Linux libc6 C Library  2.0.7
- Dynamic Linker (ld.so) 1.9.10
- Linux C++ Library      27.2.1
- Procps                 1.2.9
- Procinfo               0.9
- Psmisc                 17
- Net-tools              2.01
- Sh-utils               1.16
- Autofs                 3.1.3
- Bash                   2.01.1(1)
- PPP                    2.3.10  
- Util-linux             2.9i-1.2
This problem is still present with 2.3.33 and 2.3.34
