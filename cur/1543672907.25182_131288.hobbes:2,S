No.  /dev/snd is a symbolic link to /proc/asound/dev,
and that symbolic link was created by the script you mention.
(I am not using devfs.)
So the missing "/dev/snd/controlC0" should actually be created
by the ALSA modules in the proc filesystem as
"/proc/asound/dev/controlC0".  But only the timer device is there.
(This works under Red Hat 9's standard kernel with the ALSA 0.9.3
drivers, by the way.)
