This isn't strictly true. You could do any of the make config versions,
[make config, make menuconfig, make xconfig, make oldconfig]
but you have to look at every new option, and that is a bit error prone
(because you missed something subtle, or you were hasty, whatever).
make oldconfig helps you here, because it gives you only the new
options, which is probably what you want.
Some people always like to run make xconfig as well, because Rusty
says "it is the only one with a static parser" (or something like that).
If you do this, you don't need to change anything - just save the config
again.
