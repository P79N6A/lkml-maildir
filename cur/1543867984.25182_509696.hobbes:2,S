Is there more information on this "marker" facility? e.g. what is a
marker? Are they just like tracepoints?

Thanks, I'll have a look at systemtap does. It's the stuff
src/runtime/time.c right?
Also, you might want to move this stuff from the README to someplace
more prominent on the systemtap website. It's nice not to have to dig
far to get the source...
Download systemtap sources snapshot or from CVS:
ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/systemtap/snapshots/
 
(or)
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/systemtap login
# enter "anoncvs" as the password
cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@sources.redhat.com:/cvs/systemtap co src
