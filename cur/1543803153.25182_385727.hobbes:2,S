How did you do that?
Use `make menuconfig` to configure kernel.

If you play with .config directly, run a `make oldconfig` after that.
So, `make oldconfig && make && make` should always work.
If you tired that ant it did NOT, please post your .config file (not
compressed) here, or upload it to a website (somewhere).
