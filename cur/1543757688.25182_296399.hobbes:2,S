That's because it's a BIOS problem.
There are limits on how much Linux can work around BIOS breakage.

It's most likely a MTRR problem. Play more with them.

The cheaper Intel chipsets don't support >4GB at all, and you always
need some space below 4GB for PCI memory mappings/AGP aperture etc.

In general non server boards tend to be not very well or not at all
tested with a lot of memory ("a lot" is defined as >2GB for higher end
desktop boards, or >1GB on very cheap desktop boards). That is a
common problem on other motherboards too; Asus is not alone with this.
