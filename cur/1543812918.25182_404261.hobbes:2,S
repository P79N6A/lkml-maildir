I don't think that is why that function exists.. It's a no-op on most 
architectures, even where you would need to be able to do write barriers 
on IO accesses (i.e. x86_64 using CONFIG_UNORDERED_IO). I believe that 
function is intended for a more limited special case.
I think any complete memory barrier description should document that 
function as well as EXPLICITLY specifying whether or not the 
readX/writeX, etc. functions imply barriers or not.

Seconded.. The fact that there's debate over what the rules even are 
shows why this is needed so badly.
