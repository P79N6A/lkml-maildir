Keith, can you get printouts of the phys_addrs it is trying to use
there?  In fact, can you print out all of the calls to all of the
functions and all of their arguments in that file?
I'd also be especially interested in what the actual pte values are that
are getting set, what their addresses are, and what the vaddr of
boot_ioremap_space[] is.
Also, it might be possible that this data somehow got pushed above the
8MB boundary.  Getting me those addresses will let me check that.
