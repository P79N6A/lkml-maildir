I like this best too.  That way, a driver can enable a relaxed read
in the performance path and not have to audit the other reads.
So in a generic PCI driver, you'd call pcix_enable_relaxed() and
then use read() for initialization, error recovery, etc., and
use read_relaxed() in the main execution path where it is determined
to be safe.
The default would be the standard behavior that we have.
One question I have is what the need for pcix_enable_relaxed() is.
Are we thinking that this sets some bit in one or more registers?
What happens if you use read_relaxed() and you didn't call
pcix_enable_relaxed() previously?
