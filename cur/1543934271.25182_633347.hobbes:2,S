For most cases, yes, I agree with this, but due to the lockdep issues
that occur here, and the whole mess with the suspend path and locking
the device tree, that has been hashed out many times in the past, I am
interested in trying to see if there is any real reason why this is
absolutely necessary to convert.
If no one has noticed any issues in this area, I think the complexity
that will be involved in any such conversion will strongly outweigh any
simplicity that might be expected.
I'm very open to potential patches to do this, just don't ignore the
issues that others have run into in the past when attempting this.
