Yes, they are. Why? Because we cannot fit all behavior of a
devices _cleanly_ into read/write/mmap/lseek.
If we do, we would need different device views (which implies
aliasing of devices, which HPA does not like) and it would
still be not that clean, because reading from readonly gives a
stream and writing gives a stream too, not particular order
required until now.

Ok, then I give you an real world example where I idly fight with
design since nearly 2 years.
A free programmable DSP (or set of DSPs) with several kinds of
memory and additional optional devices (like DAC/ADC, ISDN frames
and sth. like that) on it. This DSP is attached via some glue
logic on Parallel port, PCI, ISA or (soon to come) USB.
This thingie can (once programmed) act as a data sink, data
source or data processing pipe.
OTOH it should be randomly accessable via debuggers and program
loaders. It is also resettable/rebootable, has discontinous
memory of certain kinds (possibly harvard architecture) and many
more funny stuff. And it needs to upload software.
I try to unify all these stuff into a "Generic Processing Device
Layer" for Linux.
Now I like to be shown how I should fit this into clean design
that:
   - uses NO ioctls (Linus)
   - has only one device per DSP (H.P.A)
   - Does not emulate ioctls via read/write transactions (which I
     consider bogus)
Theory is nice, but until someone can show me a clean design for
this (admittedly heavy ;-)) example, I just don't buy your
arguments. 
A *better* ioctl would be nice, but we still need an "catch all
exceptional accesses" interface, IMNSHO.
