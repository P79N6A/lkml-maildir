but we need to protect from interrupts while accessing the card and waiting for
completion. semaphores don't protect you from that. spin_lock_irqsave does. the
spin_lock in the interrupt handler is there to protect from interrupts from
other processors in a SMP system (see Documentation/spinlocks.txt) and is btw.
a no-op on UP. and semaphores are quite heavy....

fixes:
- return values
- when to free the skb, when not
- disabling the queues
- netif_wake_queue called from the interrupt handler only (and on the right
  net_device)
- i think the priv->xmit stuff and then the schedule_work is evil:
  if you return 0 from the dev->hard_start_xmit then the network layer assumes
  that the packet was kfree_skb()'ed (which does only frees the packet when the
  refcount drops to zero.) this is the cause for the keventd killing, for sure!
  if you return 0 you already kfree_skb()'ed the packet. and that's it.

-       for(s = &statr->beaconPeriod; s <= &statr->_reserved[9]; s++)
+       for(s = &statr->beaconPeriod; s <= &statr->_reserved1; s++)
...which you also fixed in your patchset. (which is harmless on little-endian
machines and evil on big-endian machines)
