...this is my first patch submission, so forgive me if I screw this up  
horribly.  :)
Okay. Normally I just rip the internal speaker out of my computers, since 
they generally irritate me, but on my Vaio laptop, speaker surgery is a 
little less simple.
So I've got some kernel patches to disable beeps and blips from the internal 
speaker. To make this more flexible, the user (through menuconfig or 
whatnot), can opt to change the internal speaker accessing code in one of 
three ways: leave the virtual terminal code unmolested ("Enabled"), remove 
it completely for a slightly smaller and quieter kernel ("Disabled"), or 
allow the speaker to be enabled or disabled at runtime via an ioctl() call 
to /dev/console ("Dynamic").
This should work on all architectures that support an internal speaker, but 
I've only tested it on i386.
I have patches against 2.3.34 and 2.2.13, and a simple user-space program to 
toggle the speaker on and off with those ioctl() calls I mentioned. It's all 
a couple of pages of code, so rather than flood the list, I've placed it at:
ftp://gamehenge.dyndns.org/pub/squeaker/
(despite the dyndns.org domain, it's not a dialup; it's a cable modem, so 
it's available 24 hours a day.)
I will happily email the code to anyone who has trouble downloading it.
Please let me know whay y'all think; if this is useful and if it might be 
qualified for inclusion in an official kernel release.
I'm not subscribed to this list, so I'd appreciate comments and hate mail 
being CC'd to ryan_gordon@hotmail.com ...thanks!
