If you don't get an answer it might be that:
- your question is off topic for this list
- the answer is too trivial to tell
- nobody had time to answer it
In any case don't post the same question within 30 minutes.
Getting the source of a package is simple. On an RPM compatible system
(Red Hat, SuSE, Mandrake):
  erik@merijn:~ >rpm -qf `which ps`
  procps-2.0.6-5
  (get the procps-2.0.6 SRPM from CD or download it from the web)
On a Debian system it's even easier:
  erik@arthur:~ >dpkg -S `which ps`
  procps: /bin/ps
  erik@arthur:~ >apt-get -qq source procps
  dpkg-source: extracting procps in procps-2.0.7
