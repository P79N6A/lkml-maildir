Two suggestions:
1) I know it's a quite minor -- and OK -- change, but please do CC 
relevant subsystem maintainers when you update the drivers (like net 
drivers -> me).
2) Including a patch for review would be useful.  I use the attached 
script to generate the pull request emails that go to Linus.  Others, 
like Greg KH, post individual patches for review before sending upstream 
-- but I think the latter is probably a bit much for blackfin.
Cheers!
