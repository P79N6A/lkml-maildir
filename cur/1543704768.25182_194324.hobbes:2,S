	Thanks (in my system - Fedora Core 0.96 - it is "irqbalance", without
the "d" at the end, from kernel-utils package). When I ran it it migrated
some IRQs to CPU1, so this is probably OK. Thanks.

	This is what I expected. OK.

	Does not work:
ioctl32(tw_cli:32216): Unknown cmd fd(3) cmd(0000001f){00} arg(080dd2e0) on /dev/twe0
I have asked 3ware.
	Thanks for your help,
