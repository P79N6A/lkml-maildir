For the -rest stuff (and very few other split patches) there's still no
evidence that it needs to go into mainline.  But having the other stuff
in would certainly help to not only make mainline useable under higher loads
on not-lowend heardware and has the additional benefit that later patches
form -aa might just apply instead of people like me needing to spend some
time on merging them over just to not get them applied anyway..
