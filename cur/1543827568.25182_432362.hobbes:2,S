Just FYI for this thread, most of the bootloaders I work with
don't let me change the kernel command line.  Many have no
knowledge of Linux whatsoever.  Many boards, especially internal
boards, have hobbled-together custom bootloaders.
Hence, I've gotten out of the habit of figuring out how to set
the command line args from the bootloader even for those
platforms where the bootloader *is* capable of it.
