Booting with: vga=normal no387 nofxsr
gets me no forther.   These are all the messages I get:
 boot: 2.6.18rc7git2 vga=normal no387 nofxsr
 Loading 2.6.18rc7git2...................................
 BIOS data check successful
 Uncompressing Linux... Ok, booting the kernel.
And then the system hangs and requires a power cycle.
So unfortunately that does't help much :-(
