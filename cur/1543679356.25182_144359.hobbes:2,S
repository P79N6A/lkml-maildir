These are checks of the "cannot happen" type, where "cannot happen"
can be seen by the compiler, so that it can optimize the tests away.
As it is now, correctness of the code can be seen locally.
If the tests are removed, a human reader must look up the values
of these constants to conclude that the code is correct.
