As you said yourself, the problem with the PS/2 AUX interface is that
there are so many different implementations out there. I have followed
the original spec, the "Personal System/2 Hardware Interface Technical
Reference - AT-Bus Systems" published by IBM. That document does not
mention the "AUX interface test" (0xA9) at all. It also does not allow
the "Write to AUX output buffer" to be optional.
There may be other, conflicting specifications out there and a lot of
systems adhering to them, but with my 6+ years of fighting with the PS/2
aux port, I'm pretty confident that you will bump into controllers that
don't implement 0xA9 either.

My documentation treats the AUX Disable bit as a write-only bit.
But OK, thanks for the tip, I think a safe way to proceed is to change
the test to first do a 0xA9 command, and if that fails, try what we do
now.
