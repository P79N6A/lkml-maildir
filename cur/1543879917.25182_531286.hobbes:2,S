You should provide intent information, yes - which your patch didn't :)
And yes, I didn't like doing the ugly intent in nameidata hack, it's
creating loads of problems for various parties, e.g. the stackable
filesystem folks.  Now the basic intent in nameidata mistaken has been
made even worse by passing back a struct file in it conditionally and
doing lots of work in ->lookup that shouldn't be there.  (Which btw,
I expect to cause quite a few problems for apparmor or other lsms,
but I guess so far no one has tried them on NFSv4)
