Isn't this why noflushd exists or is this an evil thing that shouldn't
ever be used and will eventually eat my disks for breakfast?
Description: allow idle hard disks to spin down
 Noflushd is a daemon that spins down disks that have not been read from
 after a certain amount of time, and then prevents disk writes from
 spinning them back up. It's targeted for laptops but can be used on any
 computer with IDE disks. The effect is that the hard disk actually spins
 down, saving you battery power, and shutting off the loudest component of
 most computers.
