Ahh.. of course.  I must have misread your original.
Yes, sata_qstor generally assumes that host_stop should completely
stop the host from operating.. and thereby expects any port_stop()
calls to happen before host_stop().  So, yup, the changes you have
seem to be useful here.
If we didn't want to have a prewalk() method, then we could hack
sata_qstor to keep a count of active ("non stopped") ports,
and automatically do the global (chip) interrupt disable from
port_stop() whenever the count hits zero.
Cheers
