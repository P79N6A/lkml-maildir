It certainly doesn't look pretty, but I think it's manageable with a
comment, or maybe breaking the operation up into a few lines instead.

There is some precedent in the kernel for a table such as this.  Take a
look at the NUMA page_to_pfn() and page_zone() functions.  They use a
zone_table array to do that same kind of thing.
Are you worried bout the pfn_to_page() function itself, that it will
pull in 2 cachelines of data: 1 for phys_section[] and another for
mem_section[]?

What do you mean by common code?  It should be shared by all
architectures.
