Are you using the full kernel.org kernel, or are you putting sky2 driver into
the SUSE kernel? There are a number of bug fixes related to hardware checksumming
that are in the kernel.org kernel (2.6.15 or later).  There was one in ICMP.
These fixes relate to places in the code where a protocol decides to trim a
packet by removing bytes. I am not familiar with the SuSE Firewall. Is it just
standard netfilter modules or additional code?
