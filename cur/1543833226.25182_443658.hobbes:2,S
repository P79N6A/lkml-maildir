You're right, I didn't -- my apologies. However:

If you change my wording from "all cleared up message" to "clearing
the internal state that keeps track of whether we're still in an
overcurrent situation" then my suggestion still makes sense. In short,
don't believe we're out of the overcurrent state until a bit of time
passes.
Before we go any further, let's make sure my suggestion could even fix
anything for Dave. Dave? How often are these messages printed? Do they
come in clumps? Or are they periodic? In other words, would a bit of
hystersis in the state clearing code remove most of the messages for
you? Or am I just stirring up trouble?
