Not necessary.
Why not have the FUSE daemon keep open a file descriptor for the
directory it's mounted on, and have it sent that to new would-be
mounters of the same directory using a unix domain socket (rather as
Pavel suggested)?

No.  The check is to prevent processes in chroot jails from accessing
directories outside their jail.  Even CAP_SYS_ADMIN processes must be
forbidden from doing that.
But proc_check_root is unnecessarily strict, in that it prevents a
process from traversing into a "child" namespace.
IMHO, a better security restriction anyway would be for processes in
chroot jails to not be able to see processes outside the jail in /proc
- only processes inside the jail should be visible.  I think everyone
agrees that would be best.
If that were implemented, then proc_check_root would be redundant and
could be removed entirely.
