Subject: Question about module names containing "-" or" "_" characters

Hi:
This is just a curiosity, but I have observed that you can load modules
containing the characters "-" and "_" using any of "-" or "_" in the
module name. In /proc/modules they get reported with the file name, not
with the name used to load them (except, at least, dm-mod.ko, that is
shown as dm_mod).
I don't know if this is expected behaviour, but I report it just in case
nobody else noticed before. I am using Linux kernel 2.6.0-test1 and
module-init-tools version 0.9.11.
Regards,
