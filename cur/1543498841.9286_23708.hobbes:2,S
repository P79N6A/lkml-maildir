Sorry if I don't share your ideas about humour.

Setting up initrd is where the bother is. Scsidev won't need any change at  
all. And would you please explain how devfs copes with this without having  
an initrd? Where, exactly, does it find the information where the root  
partition has migrated to?
Or do you mean to say it only solves those situations where the controller- 
target pair doesn't change? Because scsidev doesn't share that particular  
restriction.

Where's the problem with that? It's fast, it does what I want, it only  
needs set up once (and that could be done by the distribution).

Bull. That just shows that having only read-only file systems is awkward -  
big surprise, we knew that already.

But it's not "a way to avoid devfs". As far as I can make out, it gives me  
something that devfs *doesn't* give me.
Maybe I need to show you my /etc/scsi.alias file to make you understand:
alias=QGP, manufacturer=QUANTUM, model=XP34301, devtype=disk, serial_number="474508450481"
alias=TXM, manufacturer=TOSHIBA, model="CD-ROM XM-4101TA", devtype=cdrom
alias=IDCRS, manufacturer=OEM, model=DCRS04Z, devtype=disk, serial_number="        13034022"
alias=IDCAS, manufacturer=IBM, model=DCAS-34330, devtype=disk, serial_number="B3G17619"
alias=QAt, manufacturer=Quantum, model=XP34300, devtype=disk, serial_number="PCB=ZG54951879 U; HDA=MP61654259"
alias=IDGHS, manufacturer=IBM, model=DGHS18Z, devtype=disk, serial_number="      680B2E55GK"
So: I can completely change my SCSI controller setup (say, invest in one  
controller per device), completely renumber all the disks, and
/dev/scsi/QGP will still point to the same disk.
How do you do *that* with devfs?

"Problems"? "Less reliable"?
Go pull the other one, it has bells on it.
