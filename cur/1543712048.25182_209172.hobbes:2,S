Like Maciej wrote, the machine's local APIC bus corrupts messages.
The fact that your other supposedly-identical machines don't have
this problem indicates strongly that this particular box has a HW
problem. It could be a weak power-supply, inadequate cooling, a
bad CPU, or a bad motherboard.
I just checked the 2.2.25 kernel and it doesn't seem to enable
APIC_LVTERR. You're problably getting APIC bus errors with 2.2
too, you just won't see them logged anywhere.
(Regarding your other boxes that need "noapic": you have tried
w/o ACPI, right? acpi=off or pci=noacpi.)
