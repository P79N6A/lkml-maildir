If it's important, it's probably worth investing in a hardware watchdog, to
catch the (hopefully exceedingly rare) cases where the machine hangs rather
than panic()ing.
Thinking about it: the kernel doesn't always panic on oopsen, does it? This
probably needs to be settable via sysctl, a la reboot-on-panic.
