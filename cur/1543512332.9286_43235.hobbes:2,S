Would a /proc/devices file which lists all devices also solve your
problems with the existing system? 
I like the /proc/devices idea. It's relatively simple. It avoids a
lot of contentious ideas (permissions, not using VFS, mechanism vs
policy). Including /proc/devices will not impact /dev at all (thus
avoids persistence arguments).
But a /proc/devices will still let you have your autodetection and
let me have a dynamically changing /dev.

HPA, would you be open to the idea of /proc/devices. This won't be
a terrific loss of functionality from the existing devfs.
