Which is with compliance with PIO-in protocol specification and years of
usage of the task_in_intr() code for fs code paths and HDIO_DRIVE_TASKFILE
ioctl has proven that real hardware also works this way (please note that
the changed code was used only for HDIO_DRIVE_CMD ioctl requests).

If INTRQ is asserted and "BSY is cleared to zero and DRQ is cleared, then
the device has completed the command with an error." (thus task_in_intr()
assumed ERR bit to be set), otherwise the value ERR may not be defined
(however task_in_intr() still assumed that it is OK to check ERR bit).
Additionally handling of premature shared PCI interrupts comes into the
picture making the whole thing much more messier.  It could happen in the
past that drive_is_ready() was called before drive had time to assert BSY
so later also task_in_intr() assumed that the drive is ready.  However this
should be already fixed as we now always guarantee sufficient delay after
the command was written so how's about the following patch which just makes
DRQ == 0 || BSY == 1 || ERR == 1 an error (ideally we should also proceed
with transfer if DRQ == 1 && ERR == 1 but it may have other gotchas so lets
keep it as it was for now):

preferably this should get some testing in -mm first

Now back to the recent debug log from Anders:
Mar 18 16:02:14 tippex hda: tf: feat 0xd2 nsect 0xf1 lbal 0x00 lbam 0x4f lbah 0xc2 dev 0x00 cmd 0xb0

Mar 18 16:02:14 tippex task_in_intr: hda: stat=50
This is SMART command with SMART ENABLE ATTRIBUTE AUTOSAVE sub-command
(feat == 0xd2, nsect == 0xf1) but it should use no-data protocol instead of
PIO-in which brings us back to commit 18a056feccabdfa9764016a615121b194828bc72

as can be seen before this patch protocol to use was decided basing on DRQ bit
being set - what would you call _that_ if taskfile code is horrible, he? ;-)
[ I tried really hard to make patchset which converted HDIO_DRIVE_CMD to use
  the common code as bisectable and simple as possible (by separating real
  changes in behavior from pure code transformations and making patches of
  small granularity) since potential problems were kind of expected but
  I must admit that I completely overlooked the hidden meaning of DRQ_STAT
  check... ]
Later commit 4d977e43d8ae758434e603cf2455d955f71c77c4 just triggered the bug...
The "real" fix (Anders, please test it):

BTW libata seems to have exactly the same problem but it
is hidden by the lack of quirk for "premature PCI IRQs"
