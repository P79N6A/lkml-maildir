Hi All,
I have a couple of questions:
Do kernel threads get preempted? Or do they have to
give up the CPU on their own? 
Are there any rules for what scheduling policies and
priority a kernel thread can have?
reparent_to_init()sets the scheduling policy to
SCHED_OTHER. Do you see a problem with changing the
scheduling policy to  SCHED_FIFO?
Thanks,
Akram
