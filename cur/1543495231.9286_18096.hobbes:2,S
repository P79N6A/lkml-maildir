The only difference on boot-up is the 2.2.7 does DMA by default the
geometry messages are the exact same ..
My lilo.conf has no linear option, it does have the fix-table option (I
need to boot an NT install also) .... IDE drive, the only one in the
system.......
I can post the relevant files, there at home at the moment, will bring in
a floppy tomorrow ..
