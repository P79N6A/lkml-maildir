I'd love to, but I suspect we lack the motivation to do so, and there 
aren't any obvious upsides. Yes, the code is ugly, but it's also fairly 
stable so people seldom need to look at it.
The motivation for doing the ANSI-fication is just that there is now a 
sanity checker tool that will complain loudly about bad typing, and since 
I wrote it and I hate old-style K&R sources, it doesn't parse them.

I wouldn't mind syncing more, but one reason _against_ syncing the zlib 
sources have been the ugliness of them. Is there any reason for the 
K&R'ness any more, or the strange allocators?
