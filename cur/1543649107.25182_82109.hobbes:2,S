I'm playing with userspace applications which want to monitor the status of 
IrDA and Bluetooth devices. Rather than polling for the interface state 
(this is a handheld device and polling wastes CPU and battery), I want to 
use netlink. 
I have two problems:
 1. I appear to need CAP_NET_ADMIN to bind to the netlink groups which give
	me this  information. I can poll for it just fine, but need 
	elevated privs to be notified. Why is this, and is there a workaround?
 2. Even root doesn't get notification of state changes for Bluetooth
	interfaces, because they're not treated as 'normal' network devices
	like IrDA devices are. I can see the logic behind that -- by why
	is it done differently from IrDA? Is there a way to get notification
	of BT interface state changes?
