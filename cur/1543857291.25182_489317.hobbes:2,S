Actually, there may be a standards conflict here.  SPC says that all
devices reporting compliance with this standard (as the inquiry data for
this device claims) shall support REPORT LUNS.  On the other hand, MMC
doesn't list REPORT LUNS in its table of mandatory commands.
I'm starting to think that even if they report a SCSI compliance level
of 3 or greater, we still shouldn't send REPORT LUNS to devices that
return MMC type unless we have a white list override.
