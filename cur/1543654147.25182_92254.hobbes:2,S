Yes, but between doing and undoing (in the failure path) someone has
started using the module.  The old modutils would unload it underneath
them here.  I catch it (if CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD, otherwise I can't)
and yell "module is now stuck" and leave it hanging.
Given we have a method of isolating a module already, it seems logical
to use it to prevent exactly this race.  Unfortunately my last attempt
assumed noone did this, and broke IDE and SCSI (hence pissing
*everyone* off 8).
Cheers,
Rusty.
