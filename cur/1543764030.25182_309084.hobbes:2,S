Subject: [04/08] I2C: Fix oops in eeprom driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
This fixes an oops in the eeprom driver. It was first reported here:
  
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4347
It was additionally discussed here (while tracking a completely
different bug):
  
http://archives.andrew.net.au/lm-sensors/msg30021.html
The patch is already in 2.6.12-rc1:
  
http://linux.bkbits.net:8080/linux-2.5/cset@1.2227
The oops happens when one reads data from the sysfs interface file such
that (off < 16) and (count < 16 - off). For example "sensors" from
lm_sensors 2.9.0 does this, and causes the oops.
