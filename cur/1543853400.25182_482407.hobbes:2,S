yes, I _just_ use x86_64 never test it on i386.

Well, the only kernel where I can work (yes I use computer to work) is
2.6.18 + dyntick. I think don't hid neither solve the issue, is just use
other resource (clocksource) that works better ! .

I just test 2.6.19-RC5-mm2 and still very unstable even with notsc. 
And after bootup, yes appears some lost tick messages.
Just trying rebuild other kernel and use command yum to update others
things, at same time, have lock up my computer.
So I back to kernel 2.6.18 + dyntick
