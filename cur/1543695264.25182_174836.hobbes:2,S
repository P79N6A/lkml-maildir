Speaking of XFree86: when I developed the PCI resource stuff in 
XFree86 I was trying to get support from kernel folks to get the 
appropriate user space interfaces into the kernel. When I got 
nowhere I decided to do everything myself. 
XFree86 does PCI bridge tracking and one reason it does this is PCI
ROM mapping.

Right. One reason why the PCI code in XFree86 looks so difficult is
that old ATi Mach?? cards had their 8514 registers (and their mirror
images) scattered all over the PIO space.

[Stuff deleted] .....
Is there any API that allows one to do this from user space?
There are plenty of XFree86 drivers around that don't have a
DRM kernel module and it should  be possible to run those which
do without DRI support, therefore it would be a good if the
XFree86 driver could do this registration itself.
Cheers,
