The behavior of select and poll for read and write must be somewhat
different when it comes to blocking. This is because of the difference
between read() and write().
If I attempt to read() N bytes and there is only one byte available,
read() will immediately return with the one byte. Its return value
will show one byte was received even though the caller "requested"
N bytes. This is the expected behavior. Therefore when select() shows
that data are available, there may be only one byte available.
On a write(), the caller expects that all the bytes being written
will, in fact occur eventually occur. However select() doesn't
know how many bytes the caller expects to write. It only knows that
the caller can write some. This "some" in principle, may be only
one byte. The user of select and write needs to be prepared to
make multiple calls to complete the writing of large buffers.
To do this, one can set the write() file-descriptor to non-blocking
and simply make repeated write() calls, checking the return value
(and errno) each time. However, this wastes CPU cycles. Instead
of this, the caller can still keep a non-blocking file-descriptor,
but sleep in select() or poll() until the kernel has space for
more bytes. The kernel can never guarantee, nor is there a way to
show, space for N bytes. The caller just has to walk up the buffer
and make as many calls as necessary.
