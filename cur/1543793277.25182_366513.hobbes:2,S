While agreeing that PlugSched's configuration needs overhaul I don't 
think this is it as it just makes things more confusing.  I'll put 
fixing the configuration code on my list of things to do.  They main 
changes I see as necessary are:
1. Make the ability to select which schedulers are built in independent 
of EMBEDDED.
2. Only offer builtin schedulers as choice for the default scheduler.
3. Only build in ingosched if PLUGSCHED is not configured.
I'll try to get this change done next week.
