What part of: "You will need to enable the experimental  
MD_RAID5_RESHAPE config option for this to work." isn't bvious?  If  
you don't want this feature, either don't turn on  
CONFIG_MD_RAID5_RESHAPE, or don't use the raid5 mdadm reshaping  
command.  This feature might be extremely useful for some people  
(including me on occasion), but I would not trust it even on my  
family's fileserver (let alone a corporate one) until it's been  
through several generations of testing and bugfixing.

There is no way to make Linux robust with unreliable memory  
subsystems, sorry.  It would be like trying to make a human more  
robust with an unreliable O2 supply. Memory just has to work.
