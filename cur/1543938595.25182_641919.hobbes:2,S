This is the eighth version of my solution for the bug #2645:
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2645
Since the previous version, the following has changed:
1) based on Linus' comment, a more efficient PTE walker implemented;
2) the design document added to the kernel documentation.
Functional tests successfully passed.
Please comment.
