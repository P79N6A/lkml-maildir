Here is one patch against your 2.6.25-git tree.
It provides a new function, dev_name() to help with the transition away
from using the bus_id field in struct device.  The full transision will
happen over the next few kernel releases.
Please pull from:
	master.kernel.org:/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/gregkh/driver-2.6.git/
The patch will be sent as a follow-on to this message to lkml for people
to see.
thanks,
greg k-h
