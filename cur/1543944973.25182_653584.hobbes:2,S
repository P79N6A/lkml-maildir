Linus,
could you please pull from 'for-linus' branch of
        git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jikos/hid.git for-linus
to receive fixes for HID layer.
There is one important fix for hid <-> input mapping processing. The rest 
are just addidions of new device ids that came after the merge window.
Thanks.
