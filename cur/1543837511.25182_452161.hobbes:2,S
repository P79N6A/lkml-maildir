Ok here:
Actually you have to look some lines above, namely
  gcc -Wp,-MD,arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/.head.o.d  -nostdinc -isystem 
/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.1.0/include -D__KERNEL__ -Iinclude  
-include include/linux/autoconf.h -D__ASSEMBLY__ -m64 -traditional -m32   
-c -o arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/head.o arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/head.S
It specifies both -m64 and -m32 on the line. Let's see what happens:
$ file arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/head.o
arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/head.o: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, AMD x86-64, 
version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
$ grep AFLAGS arch/x86_64/boot/compressed/Makefile
EXTRA_AFLAGS    := -traditional -m32
I would have expected it to become an ELF32 object, but it is not.
Bug or feature of gcc/as?
$ gcc -v
gcc version 4.1.0 (SUSE Linux/10.1)
$ as -v
GNU assembler version 2.16.91.0.5 (x86_64-suse-linux) using BFD version 
2.16.91.0.5 20051219 (SUSE Linux)
Patch below kills the warning, but I question how appropriate this is (it 
feels like casting a warning in C away).. I did not test how the resulting 
kernel image behaves, as I do not have any x64 that I could just reboot or 
install vmware on.
