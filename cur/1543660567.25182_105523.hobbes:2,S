Do you need to give a process being woken from the read an extra priority
boost to make sure that it actually gets run in your "few milliseconds"
window.  It would be a shame to leave the disk idle for the interval, and
then discover that the process scheduler had been running other stuff, so
that the reader didn't get a chance to issue the next read.
