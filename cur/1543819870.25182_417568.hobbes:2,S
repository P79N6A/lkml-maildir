[PATCH] alim15x3: ULI M-1573 south Bridge support
>From 
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6358
The alim15x3.c havn't been update for 3 years.  Recently when we use this
"ULI M1573" south bridge chip found that can't mount CDROM(VCD) smoothly,
must waiting for a long time.  After I check the "ULI M1573" south bridge
datasheet, I found the reason.  The reason is the "ULI M1573" version in
the Linux is "0xC7" not "0xC4" anymore So I was modified the source than it
was successed.
