OK, I'll pick that patch. Three comments however:
1* Please exclude adm9240, it is already updated in my tree.
2* Please add some comment before your Signed-off-line, explaining what
the patch is all about. It doesn't need to be long, but it needs to
exist.
3* Please include diffstat output in the patch header.
Care to respin your patch?
As a side note, I don't think it was worth sending this to Linus,
Andrew and two mailing lists. There's nothing ground breaking here.
Send this kind of patches to me as the subsystem maintainer, CC LKML
for comments if you want, and that should be sufficient.
Thanks,
