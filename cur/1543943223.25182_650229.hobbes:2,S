And one more for ->read_strategy hints :) Well, I thought that
it should be the _minimal_ controller.

Yet again - this is rather a special feature, that your controller
needs an early initialization - for a very minimal one this is not
required.
Maybe we can have two examples? One is the minimal one and the other
is an advanced one with ->attach callbacks, etc?
