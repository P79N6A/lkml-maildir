	I wonder this modification is really ok because user can't find why he
	can't mount his ufs if he does not specify ufstype=.  Putting only
	one line is not acceptable for you?
But you see, it wasn't the user at all, and it wasn't a ufs filesystem.
It is kernel probing that causes error messages. That is unwanted.
So, your version is wrong.
If it is really very desirable to warn the user the condition if(!silent)
should be added.
But in my opinion such a warning is not desirable at all.
mount(8) and Documentation/filesystems/ufs.txt explain the details.
