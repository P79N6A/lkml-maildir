I typically get thousands of such messages when using my SCSI CDRW (I think
it's specifically when I'm cat'ing or dd'ing from the drive. Specifically, I
get 2- and 3-order allocation failures. I'll use the patch Andi Kleen posted to
track down the exact locations of these errors. There seem to be no ill effects
at all from these errors.
