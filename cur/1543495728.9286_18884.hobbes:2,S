Subject: 2.2.[89] segfault in sleep?

Alpha PC164 egcs compiled.  Ran 2.2.6 for almost a month with no problems.
(I applied the latest gettimeofday patch to 2.2.9 also)
Today and yesterday I saw ippl (IP protocol logger) catch a segfault. 
That never happened before.  Then later, "top" caught a segfault!  I
recompiled ippl with -g, and tried running ippl from within gdb, and it
claimed after a while to get an illegal instruction in sleep:
Program received signal SIGILL, Illegal instruction.
0x200002a4950 in __libc_nanosleep () at __libc_nanosleep:2
This may also be what killed top, though it's not a segfault.
/lib/libc-2.0.7.so
P.S. a corefile that was generated by ippl also claimed to be from -csh,
and contained strings that were filenames from /tmp, and a list of the X
screensaver modules, and which couldn't be read by gdb.  Huh?
