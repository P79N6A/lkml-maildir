As Andreas Gruenbacher pointed out, this feature has been implemented 
just about 8 weeks ago. He also gave the following snippet as a backward 
compatible solution:
=== cut ===
echo -e 'foo:\n\t@echo $(KERNELRELEASE)\ninclude Makefile' \
     | make -f-
=== cut ===
This works fine.
Thanks to everyone for your tips and answers.
Bye, Mike
