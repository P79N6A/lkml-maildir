I never run 2.3, but 2.5 behaviour has been much better in the past. I used
to run make -j25 and mp3 didn't skip, X and all apps were still very
reponsive.
That was a lot of releases ago, before the so called linus' "interactivity"
patch. IMHO the behaviour in those releases was great; i think the
scheduler just needs a bit of tweaking from the Ingo's hand :)
