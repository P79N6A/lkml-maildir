Config sent in earlier mail ... THIS one is very stable so far. I suspect
that the chain of events in the earlier patch was that it caused some
filesystem corruption and that caused the kernel oops. I had one block of
a binary file turn up in lost+found after the cleanup of the andrea3
wreckage. Any idea how I might find out which file this belonged to? I
now have a binary file that lived in my root filesystem that is short a
block.
Andrea4 seems to be working well and "feels" faster ... will try some test
tomorrow to measure it. Wonder if the time of tonites news expire might be
any indication.
