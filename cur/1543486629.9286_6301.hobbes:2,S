I have 3 Pentium 2 machines one is a dual 333 the others are single
processors, a 400 and a 266.
The dual is the worst, they just seem to stop for anywhere between 2 and
20 seconds.  The dual is running debian 2.0r3 and the others are running
redhat 5.1
I can not find any pattern, so I wondered if this is a known problem.
DOes the pII require any special compilation options ?
