Interesting you should mention that.  As a matter of fact I have to
disable all flow control or the serial console doesn't even work.  I
considered this a minor issue and had forgotten about it.
But, in polled mode with no flow control I can transfer a 10MB file.
There are a lot of retransmits but it works.
