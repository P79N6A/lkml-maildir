 I've been tiptoeing my way into CD burning, and I recently ran off a
copy of a CD (updated drivers for my motherboard) using cdrecord to read
directly from my IDE CD drive and writing to my SCSI CDRW. I then mounted
both of them and ran a recursive diff. I got the following output:
Only in /scsicd/ASUSLM: ST5UNST.EX_
Only in /scsicd/ASUSLM: StdOle2.tl_
Only in /scsicd/ASUSLM: UNINSTAL.EX_
Only in /scsicd/ASUSLM: VB5StKit.dl_
 Now, this is weird, because /scsicd is the CDRW, and I couldn't figure
out how it could have *added* files during the burning process. An ls on
the directories in question showed no difference. A second diff -r now
showed no differecences.
 Eeek, intermittent problem! I set up a script and ran it for a while -
the problem shows up ~1/20 times, in spurts - on any given run of 10
diffs, it'll show up 3 or 4 times, or not at all. And sometimes it says
the files are only on the IDE CD, and sometimes only on the SCSI CDRW,
but it's *always* those four files.
 Current config:
 Kernel 2.2.11, unpatched except for some joystick modules. (I'm hoping
    to upgrade to 2.2.14 in the next few days) The special ALi V IDE
    patches are *not* applied. (No point since the IDE CD is the only
    IDE device in the system.)
 ASUS P5A motherboard, K6-II/400MHz (not overclocked), 2x64MB DIMMS
    (i.e. 128MB)
 Ancient Creative 4x ATAPI IDE CD, /dev/hdc, no SCSI emulation
 NCR53c825 SCSI controller, ncr53cxx driver (sym53cxx needs 825a)
 Yamaha CDRW6416SZ, has worked fine up to now
 I ran a script that just did:
  for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
  do
    mount /idecd; mount /scsicd;
    strace diff -r /idecd /scsicd 2> /tmp/pass$i;
    umount/idecd; umount/scsicd;
  done
 The key difference between a successful and unsuccessful run:
2133,2136c2133
< getdents(3, /* 39 entries */, 984)      = 896
< lseek(3, 2230, SEEK_SET)                = 2230
< lseek(3, 0, SEEK_CUR)                   = 2230
< getdents(3, /* 1 entries */, 984)       = 24
---
> getdents(3, /* 35 entries */, 984)      = 800
 And I saved a run with no problems, one with "Only in /idecd", and one
with "Only in /scicd". Of course, these files are 29MB uncompressed,
5MB gzipped, so I haven't included them, but I'll find a way to send
them to anyone who asks, or just the differences between them.
 Any ideas, on how to fix it or what to look for to further localize it?
