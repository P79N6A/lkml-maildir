Subject: [UPDATE] Minor zerocopy updates...

I've applied all pending fixes to my tree and thus updated
the 2.4.1-pre10 based zerocopy patch on kernel.org and mirrors:
ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/davem/zerocopy-2.4.1p10-2.diff.gz
The new changes are:
1) DecNET updates from Steve Whitehouse
   o endinness bug fix
   o Kill SIOCATEOR handling, better solution exists
2) TCP sendmsg now coalesces pages more optimally.
   From Alexey Kuznetsov.
3) Netfilter fixes from Rusty:
   o Obscure routing error when using masq + fwmark
   o Masquerading table had alignment issue affecting
     non-x86 platforms.
Because #1 and #3 and not netfilter specific, I will be pushing
those changes to Linus.
As stated before, the only showstopping bug report pending on the
zerocopy work are the 3c59x issues.  If people using 3c59x cards can
send success and failure reports here, that would be really
appreciated.  Thanks.
Later,
