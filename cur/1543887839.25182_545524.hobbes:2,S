May I brought up a wrong reason with the command cmpxchg64.
But disabling CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG64 helps.
The via C3 EBGA datasheet R1.9 tells me this command works always:

Hmm, I should be able to add a few small "here I am" to
the my local boot code with a little hint.
Anyway I will try tomorrow to find this on my own.
printfs for debugging are more friendly than assembler.
