Subject: linux 2.4.18 fails to load static /sbin/init

I noticed this problem when trying to boot 2.4.18 on a Netra t1 200.
Basically what will happen is the kernel will mount / read-only, then try
to load /sbin/init, at which point it hangs.  If I a dynamically linked
wrapper around /sbin/init then all is happy and the system boots fine.
Any ideas or clues?
Regards,
Aaron
