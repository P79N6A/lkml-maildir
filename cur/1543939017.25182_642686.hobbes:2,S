Subject: [PATCH 01/19] dlm: bind connections from known local address when using TCP
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/24/191

From: Lon Hohberger <lhh@redhat.com>
A common problem occurs when multiple IP addresses within the same
subnet are assigned to the same NIC.  If we make a connection attempt to
another address on the same subnet as one of those addresses, the
connection attempt will not necessarily be routed from the address we
want.
In the case of the DLM, the other nodes will quickly drop the connection
attempt, causing problems.
This patch makes the DLM bind to the local address it acquired from the
cluster manager when using TCP prior to making a connection, obviating
the need for administrators to "fix" their systems or use clever routing
tricks.
