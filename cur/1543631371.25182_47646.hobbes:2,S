The fact that they have different BogoMIPS figures indicate that that
is not really the case.  It looks more like the second processor is
running at 333 MHz or something.  You definitely have a bizarre box
here, and you probably should be running with the "notsc" option.
Heck, maybe you can reconfigure your mobo and actually run both
processors at 400 MHz.  You'd get quite a performance boost, too...
