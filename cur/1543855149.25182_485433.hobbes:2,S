Since at least the 2.6.18 development kernels, my interactive sessions have sometimes been very 
sluggish whenever a cpu-intensive process is running. This has been so bad that the mouse is 
unresponsive. The system behaved as if it were swapping; however, swapfile usage is always 0. The 
system has 820 MB RAM. I have not reported this problem as I really couldn't quantify it due to its 
intermittent nature.
Recently, I needed to run 2.6.19-rc5-mm1 to check out a problem reported by a bcm43xx user. I found 
that even with a kernel build, a git pull, and a separate build running, the system was responsive 
for interactive tasks. I have not yet identified which of the -mm1 patches "fixes" the problem, but 
plan to do so. Is there the equivalent of 'git bisect' for the -mmX kernels?
