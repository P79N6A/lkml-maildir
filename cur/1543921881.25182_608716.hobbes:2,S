Subject: [PATCH 08/13] RT: Add support for low-priority wake-up to push_rt feature
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/10/23/290

There are three events that require consideration for redistributing RT
tasks:
1) When one or more higher-priority tasks preempts a lower-one from a
   RQ
2) When a lower-priority task is woken up on a RQ
3) When a RQ downgrades its current priority
Steve Rostedt's push_rt patch addresses (1).  It hooks in right after
a new task has been switched-in.  If this was the result of an RT
preemption, or if more than one task was awoken at the same time, we
can try to push some of those other tasks away.
This patch addresses (2).  When we wake up a task, we check to see
if it would preempt the current task on the queue.  If it will not, we
attempt to find a better suited CPU (e.g. one running something lower
priority than the task being woken) and try to activate the task there.
Finally, we have (3).  In theory, we only need to balance_rt_tasks() if
the following conditions are met:
   1) One or more CPUs are in overload, AND
   2) We are about to switch to a task that lowers our priority.
(3) will be addressed in a later patch.
