Subject: 140 bugs, many of which are post-2.6.10 regressions - got a list?

Hi Andrew,
In the 2.6.12-rc1-mm1 announce.txt you say
"- Linus is away this week. Not a lot more should be going into 2.6.12 now 
and I have a list of ~140 bugs, many of which are post-2.6.10 regressions.  
We should fix these."
I'm wondering if you have a list of those bugs somewhere?
I'd like to see if I could deal with some of those, and that task is made 
infinitely more aproachable by having knowledge of what the bugs actually 
are :)
