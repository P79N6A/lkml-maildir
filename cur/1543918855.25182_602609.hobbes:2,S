You can't. I think that people will usually be interested _why_ you
voted for or against something (given the number of vote-submitters
does not go through the roof). That clearly won't fit into the subject,
and even if RFC822 allowed it, it's only displayed like 40 chars wide.
The submitter (me in this case) will even look at *all* mails, so as to
(1) address the NAKs and (2) address the hidden feature requests in
ACKs.  :-)
