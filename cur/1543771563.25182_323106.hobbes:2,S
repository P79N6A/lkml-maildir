Are you connecting it at boot time, or after the box is up and running?

Hm, another idea, can you load the pci express and standard pci hotplug
drivers?  You might have to "enable" those slots in order for the pci
core to scan the devices and set everything up properly.  
To do this, after loading the modules (pciehp and shpchp), look in
/sys/bus/pci/slots/
If there are any "slots" listed there, go into those directories and
"power them on" by simply writing a "1" to the file 'power' by using
echo.
Let us know if that helps out any or not.
Oh, and this isn't "PCI ExpressCard" type hardware is it (next
generation pcmcia/cardbus evolution.)
thanks,
