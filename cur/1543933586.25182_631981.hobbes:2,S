This doesn't build on powerpc with my .config:
In file included from arch/powerpc/kernel/asm-offsets.c:17:
include/linux/sched.h: In function ‘spin_needbreak’:
include/linux/sched.h:1947: error: implicit declaration of function ‘__raw_spin_is_contended’
I don't see where __raw_spin_is_contended is defined for any arch
other than x86, so I guess this will happen on any non-x86 arch when
SMP=y and PREEMPT=y are set?
This comes from "spinlock: lockbreak cleanup" in git-x86.
