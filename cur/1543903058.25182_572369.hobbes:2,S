Oh, so you mean use this (the negation of this, actually) as a universal
kconfig dependency of all other such development/debugging related stuff?

Anyway, what surprised me was 4/4 in this patchset. Funny that we wouldn't

developers testbox, but (knowingly) want to do that on a production website
