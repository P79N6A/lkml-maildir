guys from scalemp can probably give a better picture if needed,
but in a nutshell, there are two aspects involved with the vsmp
support. The first one
is special L1 alignments, and the second, specialized irq handling routines.
Only the second one is paravirt in itself, and are the ones addressed
in this patch.
The specialized routines now goes through paravirt ops. So when using
a vsmp machine,
paravirt has to be selected, in order to enable such functions.
