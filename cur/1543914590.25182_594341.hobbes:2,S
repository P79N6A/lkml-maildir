Well, I admit it was rather fruitless attempt to get some information out 
of Ingo, but I only did it _once_.
The problem is that the flow of informations hasn't improved since, later 
I actually answered his questions, but my information requests still go to 
/dev/null.

Getting credit is indeed not really that important to me, but apparently 
some lousy credit notes is the only way to get any kind of 
acknowledgement.
I want to get more attention, but not in a way you suspect. I don't think 
that a mouse is a really good analogy, is he really that defenseless?
All I want is to be taken a bit more seriously, the communication aspect I 
mentioned is really important. From my perspective Ingo is somewhere up on 
his pedestal and I have to scream to get any kind of attention.
I skip the rest of the mail, it's one big attempt trying to prove that I'm 
dishonest, but you only look at the issue from one side and thus making it 
yourself very easy.
bye, Roman
