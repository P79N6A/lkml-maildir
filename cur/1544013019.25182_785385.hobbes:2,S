I'm doing this since about 6 years now with all of my files and I never
experienced any silent corruption.
I also regularly experience MD mismatch_cnt effects on RAID1 with ext2/3
filesystems with heavy file removal/creation load (even before MD
implemented its self-check features - I cmp-ed and corrected them
manually before) and they all seem to have been related to metadata,
i.e. inodes.
