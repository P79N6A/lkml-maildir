Sorry, I meant "device" descriptors.  Yes, I noticed their "spec"
had strange things to say.  Is there some reason you're not including
the CDC header and union descriptors?  That spec does talk about those,
and the erratum I found also talks about better CDC ACM conformance.

I thought it was "just say no to vendor-neutral protocols" crack ...
although that close to BC they would have much better options! ;)
The purist in me is annoyed that rather than just defining a purely
vendor-specific protocol, they re-used bits and pieces of the USB-IF
CDC-ACM spec.  It's not like they needed _any_ of it.  (Unless maybe
subtle sabotoge of CDC was a goal?)
Different topic:  I noticed that on PXA you were using "ep5-int".
That's documented as always using DATA0 -- data toggle not working.
Was that making any trouble for you?  I've never actually tried
using those endpoints, because of that functional limitation.
Also it looks like you've only tested this on PXA hardware.
Most of the patch is the (R)NDIS support code, which is easy
to merge, but the "g_ether" updates will take longer.
