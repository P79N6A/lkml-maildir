Actually, no.
Without cherypicking, I just can't pull from linux-git into
linux-good. Ever. linux-git contains some changes that just can not go
anywhere. (Like for example czech-ucw-defkeymap.map)
So it should be okay to just copy object directories instead of
linking them. Or perhaps cp -al is good idea here. (It also removes
trap where I rm -rf-ed tree I did fork from....)
Heh, filesystem with auto-file-hardlinking would be nice there ;-).
