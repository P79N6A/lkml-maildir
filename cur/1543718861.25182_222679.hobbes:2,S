Subject: [PATCH] Add support for ISD-300 controller
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch adds support in unusual_devs.h for the ISD-300 USB controller
used in CD-ROM enclosures.
With it, since 2.6.0 it allowed me to move gigabytes of data and worked
without a hitch. Very helpful -- thus please consider applying :-)
