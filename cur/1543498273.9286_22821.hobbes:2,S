Well, let's see what you'd want to have for the long run.
You want to be able to cover a range of around 100e9 years (several times  
the current age of the universe), in seconds that's approximately 61 bits.  
And for resolution, you probably want at least nanoseconds (that's only 1  
GHz, in a few years cycle counters will probably run faster than that),  
that's 1e9 or about 30 bits.
91 bit together, might as well use 96 (64+32).
2^64 seconds are over 500e9 years (better use 250 signed), and 1/2^32  
seconds are about a quarter nanosecond. Sounds about right.
Now, that's for the interface. What's used internally is a completely  
different question.
