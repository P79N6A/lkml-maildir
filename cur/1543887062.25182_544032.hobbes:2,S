In fact the only use of the type should be in the obsolete ioctl-based user
interface.  So instead of changing the size of the type you should
 a) make sure you're not using cardmgr
 b) fix up those places that still use ioaddr_t where they shouldn't
    and switch the to kio_addr_t (why not just unsigned long like all
    other busses?)
