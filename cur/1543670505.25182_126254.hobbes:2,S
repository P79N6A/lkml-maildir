There are commercially available programs that guarantees to
wipe your drive clean - including hidden areas and remapped
sectors.  You should then be able to send drives
back for warranty replacement.
There are also bulk erasers that reset every bit magnetically,
but those will probably void the warranty too.  (You'll
need a low-level reformat to recreate sector addresses on the
suddenly blank surface.)
