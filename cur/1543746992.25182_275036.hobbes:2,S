When you originally did not respond to my last post of 11/2
(which you did yesterday) I assumed you
did not wish to be pestered with that issue.
I will make a patch to drop the private implementation.
Oleksy must do the testing, as I do not have that hardware.
This approach will not fix other devices that have private
write callback implementations which do not implement the new
write throttling protocol.
