Hi!
Today I tried to boot my reiserfs machine, and it said:
journal-1204: .... Trying to replay onto a log block
and it will not boot. Okay, so there's a bug in reiserfs. (Kernel
2.4.7 btw, but older kernels used to be used on same machine).
But my reiserfsck is on my reiserfs partition. That used to be okay
with ext2 :-(. Can I force reiserfs to mount without journal replay?
