We're about to migrate Openwall GNU/*/Linux (Owl) from its current gcc
3.4.5 (which we used in our 2.0 release) to gcc 4+ - and we'd rather
_not_ migrate to Linux 2.6 at the same time, if we can.  We'd be more
comfortable migrating to Linux 2.6 a few months later.
   
So your intent to add gcc 4+ support into Linux 2.4 is very welcome!
