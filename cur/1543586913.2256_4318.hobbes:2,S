hello everyone!
i recently installed suse 7.1 kernel 2.4.0-4GB on an IBM 600E laptop.
it runs execellent!
but i wanted to also have sound, so through make xconfig i added
the sound module, then i found out i had to enable reiserfs (that's what fs i use)
and pcmcia.
now it's complaining that it can't find the modules - suse installed the modules in
/usr/lib/modules/2.4.0-4GB and the new kernel is the plain 2.4.0 and is looking
in /usr/lib/modules/2.4.0
can i make a symling from 2.4.0 to 2.4.0-4GB or is there a twist in it?
is there a way i can tell from somewhere what all the options where used to complie the 
original kernel from suse where?
