I can understand Daniel's POV (from working at TimeSys once upon a time).
He works for Monta Vista which does a lot with embedded systems running on
something other than x86.  So from Daniel's POV, those "number of
architectures" is of importance. While, from those that do server work
where x86 is now becoming the dominant platform, our focus is on those.
As long as the work doesn't "break" an arch. We can argue that sched_clock
is "good enough".  If someone wants better accounting of locks on some
other arch, they can simply change sched_clock to be more precise.
