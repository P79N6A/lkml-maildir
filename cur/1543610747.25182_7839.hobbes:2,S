Sorry for not being able to discuss this issues... Its just that I'm too
busy doing the maintenance and other stuff at Conectiva at the same time
(people are flooding me with patches, btw, please stop for a while).
Daniel Quinlan suggested me to release a "pre-final" release before the
real final one (which would catch most "stupid" bugs), and I think thats a
nice way of solving the problem.
I'll _probably_ do that --- not sure yet, though.
