For what it is worth:
AMD Duron 950MHz, 768MB RAM
7200RPM 80GB Quantum Viper IDE drive, 26% full
phat-penguin:~/src/linux-2.5> time bk -r check -acv
100% |=================================================================| OK
42.710u 5.770s 2:04.63 38.8%    0+0k 0+0io 74078pf+0w
over 2 minutes of wall time, 42 seconds of "user" time... (if I'm reading it right), without primed disk caches.
The 2nd run, half a minute later:
phat-penguin:~/src/linux-2.5> time bk -r check -acv
100% |=================================================================| OK
41.900u 3.080s 0:45.53 98.7%    0+0k 0+0io 74078pf+0w
...would appear to show that BK's checksumming, on my system, is
constrained near 41 seconds of calculation time, and the difference
between the user and the wall-clock time is basically time spent
waiting for the disk to do all its reads.
I guess in that case, it'd be interesting to see what the user and
wall times were for the original poster who reported a 15+ minute
integrity check.
