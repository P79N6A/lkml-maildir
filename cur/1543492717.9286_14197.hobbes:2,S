Porting cross platform means filling in a new set of checksum and copy/checksum
handlers and building it. Its been tested 32bit big/little endian and 64bit
big/little endian.
A 16bit target would be a challenge but the stack is optimised for PC class
machines. You don't write a small tcp the same way
