I suggest you take a look at the tools 'procinfo' and 'vmstat', both
extract the kernel information from the /proc filesystem and present it
in a human-readable form.
I personally like to use procinfo as: 'procinfo -D -n1'
For hard drive performance tuning, I suggest using 'hdparm' as well. And
if you plan to use IDE drives, make sure they and your motherboard chipset
is detected as UDMA-capable.
I also suggest that you take a look ad the mdutils and raidutils for
creating a fast software raid array. Stay away from software raid5 if you
want performance (find another way to get data security then (two radi0
arrays?)). I've seen a 40GB raid0 array of four 7200RPM Maxtor UDMA
drives do about 30Mbytes/sec (2GB bonnie test) on a
Celeron333/IntelBX(Asus) system.
Cya,
