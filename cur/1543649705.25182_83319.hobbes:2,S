Jari has a few points here.  But the "killer" functionalities are all there
IMHO.  Low-level assembler implementations are over-rated, again IMHO.  The
performance difference between C and ASM is at most 50%.  1ms vs 1.5 ms.
Even if you've got a large payload on the rare occation (>5MB) block ciphers
are quite fast for 95% of applications
