I believe it may be possible, if it's not been done already, to use
the venti block archival system from Plan 9 [it's in userspace and has
been ported to linux] as well as the fossil filesystem [also in
userspace] to achieve a lossless file system configuration.  Also,
since it is served over 9P, it could be done for a remote filesystem
on a diskless node potentially.
What you end up with is a WORM device served up by Venti [which is
made efficient storagewise by coalescing like blocks and hashing them
with SHA1] and keeping a "current snapshot" served up over 9P using
Fossil.  That's how my Plan 9 box is currently configured anyway.
I think with v9fs and plan9ports you could configure something like
this though I don't know if anyone has done it yet.
If anyone is interested in how Venti scales here is a paper with
pretty graphs collecting the data of an almost 10 year usage period of
this technology at Bell Labs.
