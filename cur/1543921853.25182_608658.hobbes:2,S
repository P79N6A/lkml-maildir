It is not that easy.
CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE is given to the subadmin to bypass the pre-security
checks in kernel code, and then the detailed implementation of
limitation is done inside multiadm.
This is not just raising or lowering capabilities.

A normal user can execute suid binaries today, and so can s/he with mtadm.
I do not see where that will change - it does not need any caps atm.
