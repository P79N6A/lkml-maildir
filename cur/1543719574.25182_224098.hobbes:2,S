ran xfs_repair, no errors reported.

ECC 1.5G.  I have already swapped out memeory just to
be on the safe side.
I ran memtest with no errors

It happened 4 times and every single time, it had the
identical trace.
I brought on line a new volume with new drives to see
if I can reproduce this (same machine and same
kernel).
Any other suggetions/questions?
Thank you for the assistance.
Phy
