Nope, but the RSS limit enforcing stuff is a possible
suspect.
It turns out I used a "struct pte_t" in over_rss_limit(),
which turned into a compiler warning, for which I didn't
spot the cause ;)
A fix for the bug was sent by Roger Larsson, who spotted
the fact that "pte_t" already has a "struct" inside it.
Maybe page aging isn't working in rmap-12c because of this
stupid mistake ... but it's a long shot.  Maybe I should
release rmap 12d tonight ? ;)

Rik
