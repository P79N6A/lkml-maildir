Note that either version is still untuned and rmap for 2.5
still needs pte-highmem support.
I am encouraged by Craig's test results, which show that
rmap did a LOT less swapin IO and rmap with page aging even
less. The fact that it did too much swapout IO means one
part of the system needs tuning but doesn't say much about
the thing as a whole.
In fact, I have a feeling that our tools are still too
crude, we really need/want some statistics of what's
happening inside the VM ... I'll work on those shortly.
Once we do have the tools to look at what's happening
inside the VM we should be much better able to tune the
right places inside the VM.
regards,
Rik
