I don't say 'kill it', I say 'rename it so that its name tells users what
return value to expect'. However, one have to weigh 
long_but_easy_to_understand_name() versus cryptcnshrt() here. :-)
I usually vote for long_but_easy_to_understand_name(), but it's MHO only.

This falls in cryptcnshrt() category.
Will "new programmer" grasp form the name alone that it returns EFAULT?
