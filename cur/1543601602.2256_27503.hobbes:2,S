Yes, it's a PIII 1Ghz.  I'm not sure how important the packet sizes
are:  I can lock it with 64 byte and 128 byte packets, with the commonality
being that the CPU is maxed out and there are a massive number of little
packets all over the place.
Also, the traffic I'm running is raw packets sent straight to the
driver, not IP....
I took out the 4-port Tulip NIC and I haven't locked it up yet, though
I'm getting really sorry performance out of the sketchy machine for
some reason or another.  Still, the problem definately seems related
to the DLINK 4-port NIC at this point...
