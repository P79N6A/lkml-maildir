That's a policy decision outside of the scope of the driver model. It is 
however, inside the scope of the PM model, and by using the generic 
framework, this decision can be guaranteed to be made.

I don't necessarily agree. IMO, putting things in include/whatever/ makes 
it easy for other code to directly access those functions, some of which 
you never want people calling directly. And, if it's there, it's likely 
someone will use it someday. 
But, in the end it's your code, so I don't really care.
