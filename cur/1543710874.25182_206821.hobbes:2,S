I don't know of anybody who uses it. We did consider to drop it but we
just never got around to deciding what we were going to do about it. I
know it's there and it's *supposed* to work. 
Can we get back to you on that?  :)  It is just code that *is*
driver/hardware specific.
Actually can I just send you a patch for 2.6 for the latest 2.6 tree to
match ours? That is, rm -rf prism54/ as is and add our latest patch ?
It'd save a lot of work on our end.
We'll still do the 2.6 / 2.4 split and clean the 2.6 code of 2.4 code,
but can you just give us the opportunity to do it from within our tree?
It'd cure many headaches (on our end at least).
