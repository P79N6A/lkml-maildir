  I am not sure about that -- Oracle has rather complex ideas about
transactions, data consistency and transaction logs. Other
"mission-critical" applications may be even more finicky about the state
of the system when their shutdown procedures are running.

  And what is wrog with that? As I understand it, it shouldn't be hard to
implement in kernel, and arguments about particular policies can be left
to userspace developers.
