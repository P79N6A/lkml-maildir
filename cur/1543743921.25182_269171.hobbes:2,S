I am seeing the same problem with my bttv card. It was present in the 2.4 
day and is present to this day. There are some kernels that are more 
probable to hang while others are less. It does not depend on -ck or any 
other patchset or scheduling. I reported it to bttv maintainer year or two 
ago, but it looks like he is very unresponsive. :-) I know that this is 
not only my problem. And I know it is not probably related with nvidia or 
any other binary drivers. And it happens with zapping or mplayer v4l[12] 
too. And I tried every possible configuration of cards and IRQs. Nothing 
helps.
I suspect two things:
- there is some bug in bttv and similar drivers (DVB) that corrupts memory 
related with internal mm and vfs structures or does something equally bad,
- or maybe PCI bandwitch is overflowed, but I do not think it should 
happen.
But it is very hard to prove any of these I am afraid.
