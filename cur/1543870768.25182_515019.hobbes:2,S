Subject: [patch] sched: optimize siblings status check logic in wake_idle()
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/3/2/445

When a logical cpu 'x' already has more than one process running, then most likely
the siblings of that cpu 'x' must be busy. Otherwise the idle siblings
would have likely(in most of the scenarios) picked up the extra load making
the load on 'x' atmost one.
Use this logic to eliminate the siblings status check and minimize the cache
misses encountered on a heavily loaded system.
