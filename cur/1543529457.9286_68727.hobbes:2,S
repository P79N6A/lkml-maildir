I'm not disagreeing with you on this.  The machine that I have doesn't
require cardbus support for cdrom access.

One time, with cardbus being a module, I loaded the maestro card and after
it loaded, yenta decided to allocate irq10 for both slots.
Completely lost me on what a southbridge is.  I looked over the information,
but didn't explain it (maybe I really don't need to know =)

This happened once (pci bios assigned it this way) on my pII box, scsi card
and one of my nics got the same irq.  I didn't experience any problems, but
after I disabled things I wasn't going to use (ide) I had 1 irq free.  When
we get the irq for yenta, is it assigned via linux or via bios?

Done it once on a machine that had a dead builtin modem so I used it's irq. 
Never once had a problem since it was never used.

What's the difference between cardwatcher(kernel) and the cardmgr(user)?

What is CSC?

Actually, my versa sx is smaller than most.  I believe the panel is the same
thickness as the sony, but the system is 1" thick.  I guess that means
sony's are easier broken when dropped eh?  (BTW, I did drop the nec once,
everything still works just fine)

How is the cdrom connected to the sony laptop?  pc card?  It doesn't have a
builtin cdrom does it?

How about the pc card 574 card?  We have one at work which was purchased by
mistake (but being used)
Mar 11 09:31:31 krillin kernel: eth0: Too much work in interrupt, status e003.
Mar 11 09:31:31 krillin kernel: eth0: Host error, FIFO diagnostic register 0000.
Mar 11 09:31:31 krillin last message repeated 32 times
Those errors.  I've always had these, it seems to work better on this card,
we bought a new laptop and nic at work so I swapped the 10/100 that I had
for the one we bought.  They are the same card except the one I have is the
one above, the other was a 3cxfe575bt  (note the 'b').  The 'b' card gave me
the error more.  I did find out that the wire had something to do with it as
well.  I brought home a few cables that had rj45's on it just so I could use
the wire for something else, but I used it on the laptop.  on the 3c589
card, no problems ever.  With the 10/100, problems.  I used the wire that
came with the 10/100 card, problem went away (kernel 2.3.34 I believe was
more stable than pcmcia-modules).  No, I haven't tried the 'b' card in
2.3.51 (no longer have it)

I *DO* like this idea.  I've looked briefly at the 3c575_cb.c and noticed it
said it was mostly the 3c59x.c

Oh, by the way, the 575 driver can't be compiled in, I tried and it told me
to go away <g>

As long as it works, I'm fine with it, I've just had the preference not to
have multiple devices in use that share the same irq (PC hardware if you
know what I mean)

Why does acpi require an IRQ?  I haven't used it since it uses an irq.
Speaking of IRQs, what's the deal on machines (I have a supermicro p6dbe)
that have PCI irq's >= 16.  This would be nice if it would work on my
laptop.  My tyan s1832dl doesn't support those higher irq's (Wish it did)
