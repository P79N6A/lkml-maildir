That's right, the current ioctl API passes an `int' between userspace
and the kernel.  I'm currently working on a major rewrite of this code,
based on suggestions by Al Viro.
The new API will be:
mount -t loop -o offset=1234567890,rw foo.iso /dev/loop0
However I only started on this code last week, so I'm not quite done yet ;-)
Currently unsolved problem: encryption.  I'm certain people are not
comfortable supplying their keys on the command line, available to
anyone using ps.  So one option would be a 'key=file' option, but that
doesn't allow people to protect that with a passphrase (people _do_
use that feature, right?).  Next option is a `keyfd=N', but then we
need a losetup program, which invokes mount(2) rather than an ioctl.
Perhaps that's acceptable.
Other bright ideas urgently sought ;-)
