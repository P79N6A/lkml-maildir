This motherboard has source included (but has an unfortunate advertising
clause) at the website for the onboard nic, but I can't make it work in
2.4.22 - is this nic supported natively, or will it be?  I didn't find an
option for it in 2.4.22 or 2.6.0-test6. Is there any interest in a driver
for this board? It's a VIA VT6102 [Rhine-II].
