Hi Greg, Kenji-san,

First, many thanks to Kenji-san for his code review and
subsequent patches. They really improved the code a lot!
I've merged all his changes into my series, with the thought that
it will be better to contain all the fixes in one spot for future
bisectability purposes.
I gave Kenji-san credit in the changelog, as well at the top of
drivers/acpi/pci_slot.c, but if that's not sufficient, we can
certainly add more attributions where it's appropriate. Please
let me know.
This is v11 of the physical pci_slot series. It should be *very*
close to what I'd like to see in linux-next for further testing.
I would appreciate any final code review and if it looks ok,
maybe finally get it merged upstream. ;)
Thanks to all testers, reviewers, and commenters.
