Hello,
Did you take a look at the recently GNU-released MOSIX? MOSIX does
process-migration based clustering.
The mailing list of MOSIX is at mosix-list-request@cs.huji.ac.il, a web
site is also somewhere (probably on the same server, otherwise ask
freshmeat or dejanews and you should be able to find it).
Prof. Amnon Barak is the project leader, and he's just released MOSIX
0.92.0 for Linux 2.2.10. 
Cya,
Jelle.
