1) You need to change the last line of /etc/rc.d/init.d/halt
from "eval $command -d"
to   "eval $command -d -p"
That should do the trick.
2) Also, if you have a SMP system, you need a new apm patch (if you
want it). Find it at 
http://lwn.net/1999/0610/a/apm.html.
 I have
tested it on my home SMP system. It does not always for me though.
Sometime it will turn the pwer off, and sometime it will not. Still,
it is better than nothing for SMP systems.
