I don't think a mmap()'ed file is written to a block device while a filesystem
is frozen.  pdflush starts the writing procedure of the mmap()'ed file's
data and calls ext3_ordered_writepage.  ext3_ordered_writepage calls
ext3_journal_start to get the journal handle.  As a result, the process
waits for unfreeze in start_this_handle.

I actually tried freezing the filesystem after updating the mmap()'ed
file's data.  But, the writing to the block device didn't happen.
(It happened right after unfreeze.)
I don't think the freeze feature on the block device level is needed
because the writing for the mmap()'ed file is suspended on
the frozen filesystem.
Any comments are very welcome.
