I hit the same problem when I tried to get James to merge around a half dozen
or so entries (thats since grown to almost double that).  One possibility
is to fix this in the USB storage layer. (Assume all USB SCSI devices are
capable of handling MULTI_LUN without problem).
I believe Pete Zaitcev was writing an alternative usb-storage driver
that did something along these lines, but I'm not sure of the details.
