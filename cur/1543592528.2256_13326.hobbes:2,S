Dear all,
I am doing a research on an analytical model that describes how memory size
affects disk reads. We have done intensive measurement to validate the model.
Now, we are intereseted in another intepretation of this model as relating
memory allocation to disk reads for a process.
To validate this, we need to 
* identify private working sets of each processes
* identify initiators of disk reads
* count the number of disk reads for one process
Can anybody give me some direct pointers on the above?
Which part of the source code should be alerted?
Your help is greatly appreciated!
