Actually, probably what should be done is make the "HZ_CUSTOM" option  
depend on EXPERIMENTAL/ 
EMBEDDED/"EXPERT"/"I_KNOW_WHAT_THE_HELL_IM_DOING" or some other  
equivalent option, because a wrong choice for HZ has the potential to  
really screw up a system.  For example, 10000+ would make most  
systems spend a significant portion of their time processing timer  
interrupts and context switches, and less than 100 or so would make  
the system seem jerky.  The point is to encourage the average kernel  
builder not to change from one of the default options unless they  
really know what they're doing.
Cheers,
