There is one reason for perhaps thinking about it already. Even though the
same code base may not be in use by 2038, we already handle times well
past 2038. Currently, everytime you have to deal with times a bit into the
future you have to use your own time handling and conversion routines.
This is really no biggie, except for the fact that time conversion
routines seem to be prone to errors. Having them written once in the
standard libs may alleviate that.
