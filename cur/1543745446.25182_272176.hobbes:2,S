Ok, tried it now. The output from 2.6.10-rc2-mm1 on removal of the prism
pccard is pretty innocuous and everything works fine:
Nov 18 17:29:27 localhost kernel: hostap_cs: CS_EVENT_CARD_REMOVAL
Nov 18 17:29:27 localhost kernel: wifi0: card already removed or not
configured during shutdown
Nov 18 17:29:27 localhost kernel: wifi0: Interrupt, but dev not OK
Nov 18 17:29:27 localhost kernel: hostap_cs: Driver unloaded
