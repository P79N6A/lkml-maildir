Yes, it was running 2.6-test2-mm2 or so (don't remember exactly, I can check
though if needed) previously, but I didn't notice any bug messages from
there, and seeing that it was 2.4 I was surprised to see bug messages from md.
This is an IDE raid of three 160GB Maxtor hard drives.  Unfortunately, a rw
badblocks run didn't show the problems that showed up while trying to setup
the production system, but smartctl did, and so did the kernel while 100
sectors were being moved around by the smart firmware in the drive.  Anyway,
I'm getting a new drive, but after a few badblocks runs, and running a
couple raid resyncs (not my intention, but raid got funny after 2.6 was run
on the machine.) 
Do you have any patches for 2.6 md?  Right now this system is still in
testing, and I'd like to help get this code path tested, and fixed.
Mike
