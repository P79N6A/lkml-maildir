The 'unsafe' version is still included since in some scenarios we have
guarantee that compressed data has not been modified (for e.g. where
we keep compressed data in memory only). So, in those cases there is
no need to go for slower 'safe' version. So, the version of
decompressor selected should be left to the user (kernel dev) only -
he should make sure that he is using the right version.
