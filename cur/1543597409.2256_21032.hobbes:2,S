Linux 2.4.6-ac2 with CONFIG_MIDI_VIA82CXXX set does cause a 
kernel hang on my setup. On the first sound I play (ie cat >/dev/dsp)
an endless stream of "uart401: bad devc" messages shows up on the 
console - everything else hangs.
Related config details:
/dev/dsp is on a sound blaster live, via82cxxx_audio is the second 
sound card (not really used). Both are loaded as modules.
emu10k1 and via82cxxx share the same interrupt (5). I assume that 
the via midi driver gets confused by the interrupt that was meant
for the sound blaster live.
If I try a kernel without CONFIG_MIDI_VIA82CXXX defined, the problem
disappears.
