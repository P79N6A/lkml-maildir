Yes they are. Btw, the problem itself is not visible to the userspace,
there only messages in kernel log.

I'll try to follow your suggestion. It is not so easy, one machine
is remote. But what looks strange to me is:
1) I upgraded to 2.20.4.0 two machines, one is LSI megaraid 320-1,
other is AMI megaraid 160 (series 475).
2) The messages in kernel log I had never seen before appeared on both
of two machines.
