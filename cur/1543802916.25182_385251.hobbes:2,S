BTW, it's worth noting that the new EABI stuff has it's own set of
problems.  We have r0 to r6 to pass 32-bit or 64-bit arguments.
With EABI, 64-bit arguments will be aligned to an _even_ numbered
register.  Hence:
long sys_foo(int a, long long b, int c, long long d);
will result in the following register layouts:
	EABI				Current
r0	a				a
r1	unused				\_ b
r2	\_ b				/
r3	/				c
r4	c				\_ d
r5					/
r6	... out of space for 'd'	... room for one other int.
r7	syscall number
and as such will be uncallable with this argument ordering for EABI.
We've already had to sanitise sys_fadvise64_64() because of this.
So, I forsee more problems appearing with EABI, not less. ;(
