<asm/if.h> is a fine place to put the macros.
However, open-coding
	#include <asm/if.h>
in the places which are known to use pushfl/popfl is fragile.  Because
someone could later do something odd which results in the generation of an
unmassaged pushfl/popfl.
You need a magic bullet.  Which is why I suggest including if.h via the build
system - making it truly global.
__ASSEMBLY__ and __KERNEL__ are provided via the build system as well, and
are in scope during that first inclusion.  So it _should_ work....
