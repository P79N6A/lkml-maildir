  Indeed it is, and your observation/patch isn't the first one:

Subject: Re: memmove() in 2.4.0-test12, alpha platform
  As the patch by mr. Kokshaysky is quite different doing more work
  (and not only label name changes), I would prefer Richard Henderson

  big thing by Kokshaysky is needed.
  Full email (and patch) by Kokshaysky is at:
