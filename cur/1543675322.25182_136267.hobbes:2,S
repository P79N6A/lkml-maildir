I am trying to mount a hard disk out of a VxWorks based embedded system
under linux.
The partitions on the disk apper to be FAT16, except that instead of
restricting the number of sectors per cluster to be a power of 2 (as assumed
by the linux fat module), they can be anything (eg 40 in the partition I am
trying to mount).
Is anyone aware of existing code that can mount these partitions, or should
I get hacking?
