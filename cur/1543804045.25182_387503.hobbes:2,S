I'm not trying to ignore the warning.

Not sure which ones you refer. net_remove and ubd_remove are for different 
devices; mc_device->remove and the sysfs release are in different layers and 
for different things.

No, but since we don't have plugs, we get configuration requests to remove 
devices.
And currently, since this existed in already 2.4, the handler of the 
configuration request(mc_device->remove) does all the work to shutdown the 
interface, and then calls into the kobject stuff (with 
platform_device_unregister()); and this complains for the missing ->remove.
If it's better, we may try to move things inside the sysfs ->remove event, 
with care because different stuff has been done.
However, there are a lot of things to look at here... is there anything in 
ubd_remove() smelling awful? Because we have a crash which is caused by us 
harming sysfs data structures, which triggers on ubd_remove().
