I'm running two 244 processors not 246 processors. The process that 
causes problems is a bash shell script that builds a suite of codes. The 
scipt call other scripts that call autoreconfig then call configure and 
the cofigure dies sometimes. If I repeat the process it works. It might 
be swapping/paging related. I'm not sure how I could tell. I normally 
use stock Fedora distributions. I started seeing the problem in April 
after I installed 2.6.11-1.14_FC3smp. I'm currently running 
2.6.11-1.29_FC3smp provided by Dave Jones and I still see the problem.
