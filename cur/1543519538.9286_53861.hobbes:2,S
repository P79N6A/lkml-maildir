have a look at 
http://www.heise.de/ct/english/99/05/news1/
 (English) and 
http://www.heise.de/newsticker/data/cp-22.02.99-000/
 (German; different
text).
Additionally, the c't people mentioned in a recent issue (#24, IIRC) that
they wrote a quite simple program which allowed to re-enable the PSN after 
some wake-up from ACPI mode, I think. They don't want to publish the 
source code (yet), but would give it to some institution (a committee of 
the European parliament?) who want to do something against the PSN or
Intel in general.
IMO disabling the PSN unconditionally at boot time is the best thing Linux
can do with it.
Besides, when I look at the severe bugs mentioned in the specification 
updates, downloadable from 
http://developer.intel.com/design/PentiumIII/specupdt/,
 I wonder how any
of these P-III processors could ever work reasonably. ;-)
