Thanks, when I ment CPU local memory on SMP, I ment CPU cache.
Sorry for the confusion. I think your dynamic allocator makes
sense.

|In an SMP system, the entire memory is equidistant from the CPUs.
|So, any memory that is exclusively accessed by once cpu only
|is CPU-local. On a NUMA machine however that isn't true, so
|you need special schemes.
|
|The thing about one-copy-per-cpu allocator that I describe is that
|it interleaves per-cpu data to save on space. That is if you
|allocate per-cpu ints i1, i2, it will be laid out in memory like this -
|
|   CPU #0          CPU#1
|
| ---------       ---------         Start of cache line
|   i1              i1
|   i2              i2 
|
|   .               .
|   .               .
|   .               .
|   .               .
|   .               .
|
| ---------       ----------        End of cache line
|
|The per-cpu copies of i1 and i2 for CPU #0 and CPU #1 are allocated from 
|different cache lines of memory, but copy of i1 and i2 for CPU #0 are
|in the same cache line. This interleaving saves space by avoiding
|the need to pad small data structures to cache line sizes.
|This essentially how the static per-cpu data area in 2.5 kernel
|is laid out in memory. Since copies for CPU #0 and CPU #1 for
|the same variable are on different cache lines, assuming that
|code that accesses "this" CPU's copy will not result in cache line
|bouncing. On an SMP machine, I can allocate the cache lines
|for different CPUs, where the interleaved data structures are
|laid out, using the slab allocator. On a NUMA machine however,
|I would want to make sure that cache line allocated for this
|purpose for CPU #N is closest possible to CPU #N.
