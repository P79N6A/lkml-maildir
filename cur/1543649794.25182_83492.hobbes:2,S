Subject: [PATCH] GART driver support for generic AGP 3.0 device detection/ enabling & Intel 7205/7505 chipset support

Attached is a patch for generic AGP 3.0 device detection and enabling
routines as well as specific support for the Intel E7205 and E7505 chipset
against the 2.4.20-pre9 kernel.   
This patch adds generic enabling and detection routines based on the AGP 3.0
spec.  Some of the new features include detection of multiple devices and
proper isochronous bandwidth allocation to each discovered device, as well
as the typical host bridge initialization.  This patch also includes support
for both E7205 and E7505 chipset specific support.  It is prudent to note
that this patch does not yet implement all of the capabilities defined by
the AGP 3.0 spec.
For comments, kindly include my address in your mail as I am not currently

thanks,
matt
