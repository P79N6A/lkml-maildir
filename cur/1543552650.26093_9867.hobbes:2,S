No, these numbers look correct for me. Read comment in drivers/pci/pci.c:
	if (!is_cardbus) {
		/* Now we can scan all subordinate buses... */
		max = pci_do_scan_bus(child);
	} else {
		int i;
		/*
		 * For CardBus bridges, we leave 4 bus numbers
		 * as cards with a PCI-to-PCI bridge can be
		 * inserted later.
		 */
		max += 3;
		for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
			child->resource[i] = &dev->resource[PCI_BRIDGE_RESOURCES+i];
	}
(Well, comment should say "we leave 3 bus numbers" ;-)
Ivan.
