I agree. page->private is not used by bootmem allocator.
I would like to mark not only memmap but also pgdat (and so on)
for next step. It will be necessary for removing whole node. :-)

It may work. But, to be honest, I feel there are TOO MANY allocation/free
way for memmap (usemap and so on). If possible, I would like to
unify some of them. I would like to try it.
