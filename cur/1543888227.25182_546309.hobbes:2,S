There are the I2C functions (fb_do_probe_ddc_edid, fb_ddc_read - I wrote
them for the radeon driver, but now are available for general use) which
will issue the read command; fbmon.c has the stuff for parsing the EDID;
you usualy build a DB of supported modes which is then used to validate
the mode requested by the user. Of course each driver has to implement
the I2C adapter.

Your patch already uses 'struct i2c_adapter' in drm_edid.c, is it
portable?
