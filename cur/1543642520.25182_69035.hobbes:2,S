I'm not sure, but the last update to the S.M.A.R.T. Suite website, on 3 July this year, says that the page and the applications are no longer maintained.
Seems the Beta of version 2.0 never got finished either :-(.

You are right, the idea is to monitor the smart info, ideally from when the drive is new, but at least over a period of time, so that a change in it's behavior shows up.

Well, nothing very exotic, just some sanity checks on the SMART data when the IDE and SCSI interfaces are probed for devices.  Something like:
* Device supports/does not support following SMART features:
  * General attributes
  * Vendor attributes
  * Error log
  * Selftest log
  * Drive info
* SMART is currently enabled/disabled
* Total power-on time is currently foo hours
* Warning if any of the following is excessive:
  * Last spin up time
  * Calibration retry count
  * UDMA CRC Error count

Well, I can't see any reason for *not* using it where available - who wouldn't appreciate a warning on boot up, 'oh, by the way, /dev/hda is about to die in a couple of days :-)'

Agreed, there isn't any point in doing monitoring in kernelspace, but capabilities reporting, and sanity checks on boot might be useful.
