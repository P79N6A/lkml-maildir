Hi Marcin,
  I'm using this on one system here - it has BIOS without LBA32, and
without support for >30GB disks, but I needed to put large disk with
already existing system to it, and using some disk manager was only
choice (EZDrive, using 0_to_1 remap)... I know that 0_to_1 remap
is broken for nr_sectors > 1, but it is hard to use loop device if
system does not come up without boot manager at all.
                                    Best regards,
                                        Petr Vandrovec
