Perhaps in this case.

Because of detection limitations in legacy hardware, you may have to notify the
Plug and Play Layer that your device is using irq 5.  Booting with the parameter
pnp_reserve_irq=5 will prevent resource conflicts with the legacy SB16 device.

Hmm, it shouldn't be reporting irq 0.  The probbing code may be confused.
I would guess it is on irq 4.

It appears that you have an unresolvable resource conflict.  I'm working on
a more flexable resource manager for the 2.7 kernel.  For now, I recommend that
you disable one of your serial ports in your BIOS configuration interface and
try booting with pnp_reserve_irq=5.
Alternatively you could try enabling PnPBIOS support.  There's a slight chance
that the pci code will reroute ide2 to 14 (assuming ide2 is pci), leaving room
for your modem on 9.  You'll still need to reserve irq 5 as stated above.
Thanks,
Adam
