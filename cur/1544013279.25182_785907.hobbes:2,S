It appears that:
	- 1cdcbec1a3372c0c49c59d292e708fd07b509f18 "CRED: Neuter
	  sys_capset()" is good
	- 98870ab0a5a3f1822aee681d2997017e1c87d026 "CRED: Documentation"
	  is bad
	- f1752eec6145c97163dbce62d17cf5d928e28a27 and
	  d84f4f992cbd76e8f39c488cf0c5d123843923b1 produce the soft
	  lookup in set_groups()
... and I haven't figured out what's in between.  And the test failure
is nfsd_lookup() returning OK on a directory when it should return
nfserr_perm.  I assume that's the result of inode_permission(directory
inode, MAY_EXEC) returning 0 when it shouldn't, but I haven't confirmed
that.
