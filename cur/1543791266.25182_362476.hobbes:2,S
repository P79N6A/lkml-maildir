Hi Roman,
my "schedule obsolete OSS drivers for removal" patch does the following:
...
+config OBSOLETE_OSS_DRIVER
+       bool "Obsolete OSS drivers"
+       depends on SOUND_PRIME
...
 config SOUND_BT878
        tristate "BT878 audio dma"
-       depends on SOUND_PRIME && PCI
+       depends on SOUND_PRIME && PCI && OBSOLETE_OSS_DRIVER
...
The probem is when I'm running "make oldconfig" after applying this 
patch and say yes to OBSOLETE_OSS_DRIVER, I'm re-asked all the options 
now depending on OBSOLETE_OSS_DRIVER I had previously selected.
This is not a big issue in this specific case, but in other cases this 
might be quite annoying.
cu
Adrian
