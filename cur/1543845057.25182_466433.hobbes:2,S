Several problems with your patch format:
1) your subject line includes-a-bunch-of-words-separated-by-dashes, 
which is incorrect.  Just use standard English.
2) "2nd try" should be inside the brackets ("[", "]"), so that the 
script removes it during merge
3) All comments such as the first paragraph and "Greets, Henne" should 
be moved underneath the "---" separator, so that they are not copied 
into the kernel changelog verbatim.  You force people to hand-edit your 
email before merging.
4) No need for "From:" in the email body, it duplicates the email's 
RFC822 From header.
5) Another comment "This is the 2nd try, written for 2.6.18-git4" which 
should be moved after the "---" separator.  Otherwise, it must be 
hand-edited out.
