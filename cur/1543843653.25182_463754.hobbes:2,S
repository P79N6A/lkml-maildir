This is base on a single scenario, which is wrong.  A criteria needs to 
be establish that describes the justification for a static trace hook.  
Base on the previous comments on the thread, this list is already seems 
to big.
If a user of the trace tool absolutely need to have the best 
performance, then the propose tool should be smart enough to use static 
hooks if available but revert back to dynamic probes if there is no 
available static counter part.  This performance static tracepoint patch 
can be maintained outside of the kernel tree without bloating the 
kernel.  This way he can have mostly dynamic trace point but at least 
provide some sort of mechanism for those that absolutely must have 
static hooks in order to get useful data out of the trace tool.
