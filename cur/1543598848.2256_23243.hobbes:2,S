Look, either you implement CML2 in C (it can be done; but I'd wager it
isn't easy), or you pay someone else to do it, _or_ you stop complaining.
Simple as that. If you really can't stand having Python on your machine
(I'll bet it's a perl vs python religious thing... I have both installed),
there's always $EDITOR + .config for you to use. I promise that you won't
have to install any extra libraries/compilers/whatever to use that one.
Read the archives damn it, it's not the first time this kind of
arguing takes place here.
I'll give you another option:
make do with the current set of tools (with all of its errors and
short-comings, which are _numerous_) and maintain a forward-compatible
version.
