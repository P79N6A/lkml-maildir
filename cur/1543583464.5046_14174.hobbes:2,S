I need a giga fiber PMC cards for linux2.0.36-pre14, the only cards I know
are either Intel based or level-one lxt-1001 card, the level-one lxt-1001
has very bad performance so I cannot use it.
Thanks,
Ofer

Intel refuses to provide complete documentation for any of their ethernet
cards.  I recommend purchasing alternative products from vendors like 3com
and National Semiconduct who are cooperative in providing data needed by
the development community.
