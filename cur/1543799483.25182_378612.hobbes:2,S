Isnt there some other way to make all of this much easier to modify? Both 
the arch specific and the generic layers?
There are definitely arch specific improvements but there are also 
possible ways that the generic way of locking can be improved. Some of 
these may require changing the data structures.
F.e. I know a couple of architectures (embedded as well as different 
varieties of NUMA) that have special memory areas for locks that bypass 
the bus protocols in order to realize more efficient locking.
Large NUMA systems with lots of lock contention benefit if the one
trying to lock backs off for awhile. This is first of all a modification 
of the contention path. However, one could also want to locally block 
multiple lock attempts coming from the same node in order to reduce
contention on the NUMA interlink. See also my HBO proposal
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=linux-kernel&m=111696945030791&w=2
I would like some more flexible way of dealing with locks in general. The
code for the MUTEXes seems to lock us into a specific way of realizing 
locks again.
