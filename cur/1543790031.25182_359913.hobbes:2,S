That's right (so I'm ignoring some of your earlier stabs).
Sorry, it's looking like my comment block was inadequate.
I'm also assuming that it'd be very quickly noticed, by bad_page
or otherwise, if anyone changes these fields, so that what it's
overwriting becomes significant.
Would it be better if pte_lock_init(page) explicitly initialize each
field from _page->index onwards, so that any search for uses of that
page field shows up pte_lock_init?  With the BUILD_BUG_ON adjusted
somehow so _page->virtual is excluded (I tend to erase that one from
my mind, but we most certainly don't want a spinlock overwriting it).

Hmm indeed.  Definitely not the tradeoff I chose or would choose.
