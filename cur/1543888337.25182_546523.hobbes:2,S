I've seen patches go by using __always_inline directly.  Is there some 
janitorial effort to examine each instance of the the inline keyword and 
either replace it with "__always_inline" or remove it?
Right now "inline" seems to be about as useful as the "register" keyword.  You 
don't feed hints to a compiler like gcc, you hit it with a two-by-four and 
thumbscrews if you want to get its' attention.
