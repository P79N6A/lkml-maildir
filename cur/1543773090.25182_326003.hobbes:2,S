This is wrong.  GCC doesn't guarantee that any registers or stack state 
is preserved between asm statements.  What you really want is:
asm("outb %b0,%w1" : :
	"a" (ci_cmd->command_code),
	"d" (ci_cmd->command_address),
	"b" (command_buffer_phys_addr),
	"c" (ci_cmd->signature));
This way you don't need to explicitly push/pop %ebx and %ecx, since GCC 
will know they are being used.  If the SMI changes any of the registers 
then they need to be changed to outputs so GCC knows that they are 
clobbered.
