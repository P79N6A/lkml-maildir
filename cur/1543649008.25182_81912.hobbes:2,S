No, the sym-anything seems to be for the newer chopsets, and not the old
ncr825. I believe I tried 2.5.38 or so with that driver and it couldn't
find a device it liked. I'll try building that module again, but it didn't
work and I thought it might be causing a problem trying.
Also note that the driver inserts and fails twice (see dmesg) which is not
intuitive to me.
