well, lockdep already found a locking bug in slab.c, so by telling 
lockdep to buzz off we lose the proof of correctness :-)
but i agree that this is getting a bit too intrusive. This patch is 
really just another expression of: 'slab locking is too complex', but i 
digress. Not all hope is lost though: Arjan thinks he can do a much 
simpler annotation.
