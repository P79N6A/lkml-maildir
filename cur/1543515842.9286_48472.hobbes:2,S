Actually, from what I was just reading about Windows 2000,
Microsoft is adding a new innovative feature that they single
handedly came up with that allows you to "splice" a filesystem
onto a directory point.
I read that the reason was to do away with drive letters.  So,
hats off to Microsoft for inventing this new concept of
"splicing" filesystems onto directories.
