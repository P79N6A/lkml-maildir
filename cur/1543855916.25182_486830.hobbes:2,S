If we hit an -ENOSPC in aops->prepare_write(), we would do a truncate() to release the blocks which might have got initialized. Now the truncate would add another save link for the same inode causing a reiserfs panic for having multiple save links for the same inode.

The removed code was to return file to a length it had before direct writing far past end started 
if that direct write did not complete due to unclean shutdown.
I am not sure why it was needed. I guess that if long append (direct of bufferred) did not complete - it is ok if file becomes longer than it was before.
However, reiserfs seems to fail to update ondisk inode file size when appending big holes. The included patch fixes that.
Please, apply
From: Vladimir Saveliev <vs@namesys.com>
To write far past the end of a file reiserfs appends a hole first.
While the hole grows file size in ondisk inode has to be updated
so that in case of unclean shutdown it matches real file size.
