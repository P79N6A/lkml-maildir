The way I've been building various packages out-of-tree (including the Linux 
kernel) is:
cp -sR /path/to/actual/source/tree newdir
cd newdir
configure
make
install
cd ..
rm -rf newdir
The cp -sR creates a new tree of symlinks to the original source, and 
everything I've tried so far happily builds in such a directory.
(Yes, this breaks on cygwin.  Ask me if I care.)
