On modern hardware, port I/O is about the most expensive thing you can 
do.  The extra function call cost is totally masked by the stall.  We 
have measured with port I/O converted like this on real hardware, and 
have seen zero measurable impact on macro-benchmarks.  Micro-benchmarks 
that generate massively repeated port I/O might show some effect on 
ancient hardware, but I can't even imagine a workload which does such a 
thing, other than a polling port I/O loop perhaps - which would not be 
performance critical in any case I can reasonably imagine.
