I have the following in my .quiltrc
quilt_mail_patch_filter() {
        local x=$(cat)
        echo "$x" \
        | sed -n \
               -e 's/^\(To\|Cc\):/Recipient-\1:/ip' \
               -e 's/^Subject:/Replace-Subject:/p' \
               -e '/^\*\*\*\|---/q'
        echo
        # Discard the patch header, and pass on the rest
        echo "$x" | awk '
        !seen_from && (/^From: /) { print $0 "\n" ; seen_from = 1 }
        !in_body && (/^[-A-Za-z]+:/) { next }
        !in_body && (/^$/) { in_body = 1 ; next }
        { print }
        '
}
And I have my patches in the following form:
Subject: mail subject
From: <someone if not I, git uses it>
<area (Usually Input)>: Short patch description
Decsription
Signed-off-by: X XX
---
<patch>
Then quilt mail command seems to do the right thing.
