Yeah, that's what I'm concerned with -- the delay loops. I don't know what 
they're used for, so I don't know what the CPU speed change would affect. 
Mine would switch between 1.0GHz (996MHz according to /proc/cpuinfo) and 
733MHz (730MHz). That's a difference of 36% - a timer calibrated to wait 1s 
at 733MHz would only wait for 0.733s at 1GHz, and .3s can be quite 
important in the computing world.
And, of course, since the BIOS can't handle APCI, using an APCI timer 
wouldn't help much, would it?
