I dont think panic() is needed bug a loud printk and maybe an error
return from scsi_register() would do the trick. We do however have a
couple of drivers where "pray, the firmware does all the work" is the
right answer, but they really should be setting their own handler that
delays rather than aborting/resetting/kicking offline
