Not just modern, old controllers too, eg DAC960 (i960), ExtremeRAID 
(StrongARM), Compaq Smart-2 (AMD 29k), etc. Hard disks too. Do a 
strings on Seagate SCSI disk firmware, the 'BOS' RTOS iirc. Intel 
IXP2x00 network accelerators are Xscale+added bits (there's a port of 
Fedora for them!).
Linux could be one of several OSes running on any given PC.
