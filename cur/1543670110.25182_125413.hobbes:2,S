AFAICS, the meaning of the asm-generic directory has completely changed
during the 2.4/2.5 timeframe. They are now meant to be included from 
other header files, with the exception of unaligned.h and bitops.h.
These two files are now worthless for the purpose they were meant for. When
someone wants to start a new architecture, the maintained architectures
are the place to look at. For example, the parisc and ia64 implementations 
of bitops.h are both generic enough to be used for a new architecture 
and they actually are SMP safe and complete, while the asm-generic 
variant has been broken since linux-2.0!

I actually meant removing the asm-generic/bitops.h file, not the functions.
