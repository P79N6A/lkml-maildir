And went through a sensible process of resolving it.
And its not just mutt. HSM stuff stops working which is a big deal as
stuff clogs up. The /tmp/ cleaning tools go wrong as well.
These are big deals because you seem intent on using a large hammer to
force a change that should be done properly by other means.
The /tmp cleaning for example can probably be done other ways in future
but the changes should be in place first.
