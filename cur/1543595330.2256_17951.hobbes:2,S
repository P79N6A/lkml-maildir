I've seen this under UML, Rik van Riel has seen it on a physical box, and we 
suspect that they're the same problem (i.e. mine isn't a UML-specific bug).
I've done some poking at the problem, but haven't really learned anything 
except that something is locking pages and not unlocking them.  Figuring out 
who that is was going to be my next step.
If anyone is interested in poking around a UML in this state (i.e. you get all 
the niceties of gdb), let me know.  I think I can probably oblige.
