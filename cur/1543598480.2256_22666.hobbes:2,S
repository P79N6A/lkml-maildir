I /think/ the answer is 'it depends'.
a) If 'low entropy' meant 'no entropy', then the seed would be the
   same booting one system as on a black-hat identical system.
b) If you can obtain (one way or another) a session key, you can hijack
   that session. Whether or not you can then intercept other sessions
   depends in part what that session is (if, for instance, it is a root
   ssh session...). If you reduce the search space for session keys, you
   make being able to hijack a session considerably easier.
