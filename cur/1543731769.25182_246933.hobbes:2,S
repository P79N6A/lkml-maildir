You are assuming that the hiding has to be embodied by the dentry cache. 
That sounds hard. Let's not do that; I am too lazy.
We can put it at a layer above that. Let us have a "mask" concept. For 
the purposes of this discussion, the mask can be made totally trivial 
and hardcoded, with none of the expressive power of my new DoD project, 
and can probably be coded in a few hours to exclude the metas. For my 
new DoD project we are creating a configurable, scalable, sophisticated 
"mask" abstraction, and you must successfully pass through the mask 
before you can ask if the filesystem contains X/Y/Z. (For the darpa 
project with the general purpose masks with specifications and all that 
we will take 6 months, not a few hours.)
The rest shall wait until after I get a bite to eat, ok?
