So, it sounds to me then, like unless I'm willing to really re-write the APIC
setup code (which I don't feel qualified to do quite yet), that the immediate
solution would be to not rely on interrupts in legacy mode, which was according
to my understanding, what the use of the irqpoll command line option was
supposed to enable.  Any thoughts as to why that might not be working in this
case, or suggested tests to determine a cause there?
