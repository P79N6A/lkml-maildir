Agreed. How about changing the way printk works, so that instead of 
combining the format string, it just "prints" its args:
printk("%s: name %p is %d\n", name, ptr, val);
results in the following in the kernel buffer:
"%s: name %p is %d\n", "stringval", 0x4790243, 44
Then run a process to either push them together again (native mode) or do 
the getmsg() thing for i18n mode?
Only problem I can see is early-boot, where the normal demons can't be 
running. Could we have a  kernel-thread that can be run ASAP and does the 
native-mode thing, that can be killed if userspace runs an i18n demon?
HTH,
