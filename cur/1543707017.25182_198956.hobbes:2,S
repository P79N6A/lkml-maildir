Right, such policy belongs to userpsace it seems.
The reason why I put it into the multipath target is to cover the case,
where all paths are inoperational, the system is OOM _and_ the only
chance to recover from that is the hope to unfail a path in order to
release memory preasure.
'Sorry, userspace test handler can't run, your enterprise server
is a pile of sh..' is not acceptable in case there's a path we
could unfail IMO.
