If gcc crashed when compiling 2.6.22-git1, and it didn't crash using
2.6.22, it would be really good idea to git bisect between 2.6.22 and
HEAD, to see what caused the gcc crash.
There may be two issues hiding here; whatever changeset caused the gcc
crash, and whatever change caused your 2.6.22 kernel to hang on boot;
they may not have the same root cause!
