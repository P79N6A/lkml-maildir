Because the platform which I use did not implement smbus_xfer yet,
it only implemented  master_xfer in struct i2c_algorithm.
I can add smbus_xfer for my platform. I have one question and
I know that smbus is a subset from the I2C protocol.
Is smbus_xfer method better than master_xfer or is there any
special reason to use smbus_xfer?

It's for i2c_check_functionality(). This function requried struct
i2c_adapter as an argument.

I saw that some I2C driver uses this function, for example - max6875.c.
Is i2c_check_functionality() not necessary for a I2C client driver?

Thank you very much for your kind comments.

I also want to get more comments. Thank you, again.
