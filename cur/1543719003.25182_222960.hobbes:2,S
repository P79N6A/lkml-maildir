 A system may have no NMI watchdog available (which requires an APIC), yet
still have an NMI button.  Though this is probably the case only for IA32
systems that are several years old now.
 Note that EISA systems have a different NMI watchdog, based on a second
8254 PIT, which we've never attempted to make use of.
