I think more people are comfirtable with this approach. Since glibc
will wrap the system call and export the "conventional" interface
(with fd first) to applications, we may not worry about keeping fd first
in kernel code. I am personally fine with this approach.
Still, if people have major concerns, we can think of getting rid of the
"mode" argument itself. Anyhow we may, in future, need to have a policy
based system call (say, for providing the goal block by applications for
performance reasons). "mode" can then be made part of it.
