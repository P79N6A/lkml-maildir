Don't know if it's the same beast, but we have a EXB-10i stacker (a box
with a tape drive at the bottom and a 10-tape cartridge robot arm), and
required no drivers whatsoever.  You just need to get the 'mtx' package,
which should be accessible from 
http://www2.wku.edu/www/fileserv/.
  The
stacker presents itself as a generic SCSI device, which mtx will send the
appropriate ioctl()s to to change tapes.  It works rather well, actually.
