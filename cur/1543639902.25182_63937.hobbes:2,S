Yes, I close the old patch, and add the new one.  Low-tech, I know 8).
The original person will get a one-liner on why the patch was closed
(like, "obsoleted by new patch").

Hmmm, but it also adds the "multiple path to Linus problem" (yeah, I
could use BK, and I could start using Borland compilers too).
I currently don't track -ac and -dj trees at all, so I'd have to add
them.  It's certainly possible.

That's something I've simply refused to get into: patches either apply
or they don't.  With about 40 patches a week and other
responsibilities, I rely on the author seeing that something broke and
retransmitting.

In total, I'm not convinced it's worth the effort.
