Correct - but why keep kernel trees around full of build files, when
there is a proper solution to keep them out of the src.
The problem was generated files. If a generated file were present in
the kernel source tree, it would not be built again.
This resulted in a few suprises during development, and I therefore
added the check for a kernel source tree with no built-files.
It can be avoided, but that required too much surgery in various
makefiles and include statements. So that part is 2.7 material.
