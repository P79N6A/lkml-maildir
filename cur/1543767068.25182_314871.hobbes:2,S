Hmmm.  You didn't mention such a restriction when you suggested fsync() 
before.  Does fsync() work completely on these kernels where O_SYNC 
doesn't?  Considering that a simple implementation of O_SYNC just does the 
equivalent of an fsync() inside every write(), that would be hard to 
understand.
