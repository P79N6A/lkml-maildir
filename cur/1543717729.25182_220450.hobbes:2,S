I merged a little patch for this into post-2.6.6, but that only addresses
prepare_write().
I wonder if there's much value in having ext3_has_free_blocks()?  We could
just retry three times even if the fs is really full?
I'd be inclined to pass a pointer to the `retry' counter into
ext3_should_retry_alloc() and implement the counting in there.  It'll tidy
things up a bit and consolidates that piece of policy in a single place.
