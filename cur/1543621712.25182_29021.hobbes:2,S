Sorry, I got it wrong. What I actually wanted to suggest is:
  leave the declarations as they are now, but do the "other"
  calculation with longs, i.e.:
    len = sprintf(page, "cpu  %u %u %u %lu\n", user, nice, system,
                  jif * smp_num_cpus - ((unsigned long) user + nice + system));
