Probably they did not pursue because they knew their patent was invalid,
and if they did fight they would probably be found guilty of bad faith
patent enforcement - treble damages, the whole bit. And maybe criminal
fraud, if they had collected enough money under the bad patent.
The XOR patent and the fraudulent enforcement of it is the purest
embodiment of everything that is wrong with the patent system and IP law.
