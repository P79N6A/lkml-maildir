The reason is that generic_make_request() takes a bio, not a request.
Loop and md don't deal with "struct request" either, they also work
directly at the bio level.
The reason the driver doesn't process the bios in sequential order
like md and loop seems to do, is because it wants to maximize I/O
performance. With a typical DVD drive, write bandwidth is 5.3MB/s and
seek times when writing are 500ms. Also, there is a big penalty for
not being able to completely fill a "zone", because it means that the
driver will have to read the missing pieces from the disc before being
able to submit the "write bio".
Is there some problem doing what the pktcdvd driver is doing?
