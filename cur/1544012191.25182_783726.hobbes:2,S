Hello.
I tried playing with some audio apps like JACK and fluidsynth, and noticed the 
following. If I set the parameters in JACK so that the latency becomes less 
than ~10 milliseconds, a faint tone appears in the headphones connected to the 
onboard sound card.
I guess that its frequency is the tone is the same as that of the interrupts 
generated by the sound card. The tone disappears if I run something like 
"while : ; do : ; done" that consumes CPU time continuously, so I guess this 
has something to do with the power-saving features and less-than-perfect PSU.
My question is: what are my options (like kernel parameters) to disable power-
saving features, other than running such CPU-eating process continuously?
