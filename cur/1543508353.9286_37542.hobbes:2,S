i agree that many people have individually gone over the same things over 
and over, to find the best way to do something.
however, it is a chicken-and-egg type problem --
imho, you cannot get the knowledge to know what works best, until you've 
experimented, and found the best way.
a HOWTO document could only generalize.  there's nothing stopping a 
badly-written event-driven model or threaded model performing worse than 
that of straight fork()/exec() type stuff.
cheers,
