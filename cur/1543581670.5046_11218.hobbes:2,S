Linux does crash early in the boot process sometimes.  Folks are
correct to be worried about handling these early crashes in such
a way that the user can learn what is going wrong with the OS.

It does crash and users can't know when it will happen 
ahead of time.  For example, I add a new piece of 
hardware that triggers a driver bug and BANG, the 
machine locks up on boot.  
Now, we can still have a "innocuous pretty boot" process,
as long as a boot parameter can be passed so that when
a kernel is crashing early in the boot process, the user
can disable the prettyboot and get to all the kernel 
messages.
