ACK:
Well duh!  OK, I blame lack of sleep on missing the obvious (and getting
up at 4am to go to the bathroom, and then responding to this doesn't
help ;)
I just applied this patch and it works.  I didn't even notice the word
"read" in down_read and up_read, otherwise I would have sent you this
patch.  I was just so frustrated at getting this to work that I just
assumed that this was a normal down and up. Oh well. At least now I
don't have to see why this works in the non-rt case.
Thanks Ingo, yes go ahead and apply your patch. That is definitely a
better solution.
