A-men to that!. Basically what really needs to happen is for all the distros to 
adopt Fedora's way of shipping kernel headers. If you're not going to ship 
source for the kernel, atleast ship kernel headers for the kernel that you are 
running.
Anything to get out-of-kernel modules compiling without jumping through 1000 
hoops is good.
