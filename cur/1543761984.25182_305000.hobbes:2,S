Yes, in /var/log/messages.  The lock up occurs without warning, so the 
only opportunity I have to look for error messages is in the syslogs.

Er... by serial console, I assume you mean via a serial cable and some 
other device.  If so, then no, I don't have that capability.  I didn't 
know about netconsole before you mentioned it; I'll do some research and 
set it up.  I do have a second computer (well, my wife's laptop is also 
running Linux) that I could use to monitor UDP traffic, if I can figure 
out what to use as a client to capture the messages.  This may take me a 
couple of days.
I didn't post to the list earlier specifically because I knew the 
debugging process would rapidly exceed my knowledge about kernel 
debugging.  I appologize for making you walk me through the process.

As a boot parameter?  I'll give that a try.
