Running Toshiba Portege 4000, I have intermittent lockups at resume from STR. 
Those lockups were less frequent before 2.6.18 ("it mostly works"); after 
switching to 2.6.18 it is rather "it almost never works". After enabling full 
console output (SysRq-9) and doing suspend/resume I got:
BUG: lock held at task exit time!
echo/1931 is exiting with locks still held!
1 lock held by by echo/1931
  #0 (acpi_gbl_hardware_lock) {+...}, at [<c01df0d8>] 
acpi_os_acquire_lock+0x8/0xa
I also have relatively bad photo of screen with stack trace but it is not 
actually interesting (it just says task was exiting).
After that system stays still, I only can press power button.
echo mentioned above is likely to be
    FILE=/sys/power/state
    PARAM=mem
    /usr/share/suspend-scripts/run_scripts $debug suspend s3
    if ! (/bin/echo $PARAM > $FILE &) ;then
        ret=1
    fi
I appreciate any hint how to further debug the issue.
TIA
