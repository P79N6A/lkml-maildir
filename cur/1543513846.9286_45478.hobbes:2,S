You have the I/O right

The IRQ is either wrong or misconfigured in the BIOS. Since windows doesnt
use the IRQ you won't notice this in windows. Check the BIOS has this IRQ
line down as a legacy ISA line. Also check the settings on the card. The
default it is shipped with is IRQ 11. Some cards also apparently got mislabelled
on the board (at least mine has IRQs on a little sticker on the board with
different IRQ values underneath if you peel it off)
