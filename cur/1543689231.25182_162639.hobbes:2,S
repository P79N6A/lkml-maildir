Yes.  Definitely.  In fact, I think that, for all systems, the initial
default should perhaps be one.
But note that the reason for n>1 pdflush threads is neither swap or
processor related.  The multiple threads can keep multiple block devices
busy, since one thread blocking on I/O will not affect another one.
I guess the real test would be to set MIN_PDFLUSH_THREADS to one and see
if one is enough for the average machines.  If the number quickly jumps
to 2 or more... then we know its a bad idea.

Number of spindles, yes.  But how do we know that?  And its just the
number of busy spindles, really.
I say we drop down to one.
