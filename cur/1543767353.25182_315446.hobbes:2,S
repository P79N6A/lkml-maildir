 The only way a real time priority process of SCHED_FIFO gets
rescheduled, is if the process voluntarily calls schedule (you call a
system call that calls schedule), or a higher priority process gets
scheduled.  I don't know what your program is doing, or what priorities
that they are running with to know if something like this has occurred.
Also, if the programs you are running haven't been locked into memory
(they exist partially on the hard drive still), then it will take time
to map the code into memory when that code is called, and a schedule
will occur then as well.
