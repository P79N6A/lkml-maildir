Subject: [PATCH 105/114] x86/Voyager: remove power management Kconfig quirk
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/1/28/587

Voyager has this PM/ACPI Kconfig quirk:
 menu "Power management and ACPI options"
	depends on !X86_VOYAGER
Most of the PM features are auto-detect so they should be safe to run
on just about any hardware. (If not, those instances need fixing.)
In any case, if a kernel is built for Voyager, the power management
options can be disabled.
