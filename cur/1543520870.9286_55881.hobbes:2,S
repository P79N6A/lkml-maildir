If everything that references time_t size variables (in all applications
and the OS) are changed, and the applications recompiled, of course
nothing will break. However, the problem remains with applications that
think that struct timeval { long tv_sec, long tv_usec } is how it works.
These applications will have to be fixed. Since ix86 machines are not
64-bits, summation of a 64-bit (long long) is a bit of a problem. I have
heard that the current 'C' compilers doesn't do a very good job.
Even incrementing a 64-bit timer tick is a problem because an increment,
past zero doesn't set the carry flag. You need to do this:
		addl $1, low_word
		adcl $0, high_word
I think that before 38 years is up, none of us will be using 32-bit
machines so, even if I was 10 years old, I wouldn't bother 'fixing'
32-bit machines. Even Intel's new stuff is 64 bits.
Adding stuff to do 'long-long' operations on a 'long' machine will just
add wasted CPU cycles. I think you should leave it alone.
Cheers,
