Subject: [RFC] NOHZ: fix nohz on cpu unplug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

Ingo, Thomas,
After using cpu unplug I have seen one cpu with enabled ticks on s390,
even on a idle systems. It turned out that nohz.cpu_mask is not
updated on cpu unplug. 
In select_nohz_load_balancer we check if the system is completely
idle to turn of load balancing. We compare the weights of
cpu_online_map with nohz.cpu_mask.
Since cpu_online_map is updated on cpu unplug, but nohz.cpu_mask is
not, the check fails and the scheduler believes that we need an 
"idle load balancer" even on a fully idle system. Since the ilb 
cpu does not deactivate the timer tick this "breaks" NOHZ.
One possible fix is to only add the cpu to the nohz.cpu_mask,
if the cpu is active.
The alternative is to add nohz.cpu_mask in the cpu hotplug path.
This patch seems to work on s390 (Shortly tested with kvm guests
with cpu hotplug and kvm_stat on the host), but I want to hear your
opinion.
