 Any chance of getting the oom killer back as an option ?  On
2.4.23-pre7 I made the mistake of trying to print a high-resolution
photo (300ppi, A4 size) using ghostscript while I was in X.  I've only
got 128MB memory and about 256MB swap on that box, which obviously
wasn't enough (gs typically uses up to 300MB for a 200ppi A4 picture).
Only problem was that X got killed instead of gs, which left the box
unuseable.  Last time I saw the oom killer in action it actually saved
me from having to reboot.
