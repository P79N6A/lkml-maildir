Really useful, thanks !
I'm using svn to manage a very small part of the kernel tree (2 files). 
It is difficult to keep in sync with mainstream development without 
having to fetch and keep huge amounts of data (this regardless of the 
version control system used).
For now I'm keeping the latest stable 2.6 release of the files I need 
in the svn repo, then when I need to sync with the rest of the world, I 
get the latest -bk patch and see if there are some related changes. If 
so, I create a new branch, apply the -bk patch (only the interesting 
part) and then apply my modifications on top of that.
That still means I have to download usually a >1MB compressed file for 
~60KB of interesting (uncompressed) data, but that is still much better 
than the gigabytes of network traffic needed for a full kernel tree and 
up to date working copies.
Thanks, bye.
