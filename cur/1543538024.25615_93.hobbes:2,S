The deadlock shows up in printk where the problem is obvious.  A call
to kmalloc before it is ready will break somewhere else in kernel, well
away from the real problem and harder to debug.  I have absolutely no
objection to removing the deadlock, but calling extra functions from
printk is wrong.

If kmalloc ever calls back to printk then you get recursion and blow
the kernel stack, again confusing the original problem.  There are
calls from kmalloc code back to printk, these are mainly for error
conditions but what if somebody wants to debug kmalloc with extra
printk statements?  In the past it was safe because printk never called
anything else, but your patch introduces recursion.  Any kernel
functions called from printk can introduce an extra source of errors.

Possible, except that one of the things that the console lock does is
stop multiple cpus writing to the console at the same time.  Bypass the
console lock to do output and you get overlapping text under SMP - hard
to read.
