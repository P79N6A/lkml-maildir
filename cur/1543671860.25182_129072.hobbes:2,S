I thought about this, and indeed, that's what I used in the program I used
to bench the first function I sent yesterday. The problem of the random, is
that it's so slow that you must build a giant table and apply your tests to
this table. So the problem mainly displaces to data cache misses which cost
more than certain operations. If you try it, you'll note that it's difficult
to get comparable results twice.
Other solutions include non-linear suites such as mixing some sequential
values with BSWAP. Eg: x ^ bswap(x) ^ bswap(x << 4).
