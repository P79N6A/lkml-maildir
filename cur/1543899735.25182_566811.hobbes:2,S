And be thankful it is open source. If Microsoft drops a driver in
Vista you don't have a choice. If Linux drops a driver you can go and
patch it back in if you feel that passionate about it.
Unfortunately things change in life but at least you have the choice
of being stuck with the old bit-rotting driver if you really want to.
