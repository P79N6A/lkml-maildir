I really think the Variable length reservation system is the way to go
for tracking hugetlb commit.  It is more robust and in my opinion, it
is better than traverse the page cache radix tree.  At least, you don't
have to worry about all the race condition there.  Oh, it also can get
rid of the hugetlb_instantiation_mutex that was introduced.  Someday,
people is going to scream at you for serializing hugetlb fault path.
