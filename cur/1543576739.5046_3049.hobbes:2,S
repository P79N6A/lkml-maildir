I tried to go the lazy way the first time.  This time I put the BUG in
there and then went chasing all the places that do
(__)remove_inode_page.  There are tentacles all over the place but I
*think* I found them all.  That turned up one more place needing
changing, and this is one you already spotted a couple of days ago, in
reclaim_page.  I subjected this patch to some dbenching without
triggering the BUG.
The try_to_unuse function calls delete_from_swap_cache and this is
pretty unfamiliar stuff for me, but it looks like the page is just
freshly read and couldn't be dirty.  There's one more case in
arch/68K/atari/stram.c (unswap_by_read), similar to try_to_unuse.
OK, I see you just posted -pre5 while I was making the patch, but here
it is anyway, as a cross-check.
