I'd say they will show the same behaviour. As far as we can tell
its an interaction between badly behaving TCQ disks (those which
allow lots of writes to bypass a read), and the anticipatory
scheduler. We will be working on fixing this so those inclined
can use huge numbers of outstanding tags without things going
too haywire.
