Nope, all the i_blocks stuff is gone.  I was just looking for a
spin_lock for serializing all allocations for a particular hugeltbfs
file and i_lock seemed to fit that bill.  It could be said, however,
that the locking strategy used in the patch protects a section of code,
not a data structure (which can be a bad idea).  Any thoughts on a less
"fishy" locking strategy for this case?
