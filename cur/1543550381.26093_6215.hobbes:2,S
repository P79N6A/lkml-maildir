It is fun, but I was not ware that scale of this mess was so great.
All I did was to make the request for Microsoft not to blow things out of
proportion.  Sheesh, by letting us, without noise or action, create R/W
support of NTFS for Linux they would have been able to give the appearence
that they were behaving.
Regardless, congrates on using the entry point.
I just hope everyone at Mircosoft is still there.
I would feel really bad if an aquiantence of my there had reprocussions.
We would need to find a way to help them out, if they took it on the chin
for us.
Cheers,
