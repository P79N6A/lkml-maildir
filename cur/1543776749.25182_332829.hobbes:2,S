Why not implement it inside the directory containg the file ?
Ie the metadata for /home/stesmi/foo is in /home/stesmi/.meta/foo
This should be suit both camps I'd think?
I mean, editing something is easy and you don't have to "know" how
to navigate /meta and you don't have the clash of files vs metadata
(is /meta/vfs/home/stesmi/foo a file or an attribute called foo of
the dir stesmi ?).
/home/stesmi/foo <- dir
/home/stesmi/.meta/foo <- "dir" containing all metadata
/home/stesmi/.meta/foo/attrib <- some attribute called attrib
/home/stesmi/foo/bar <- file
/home/stesmi/foo/.meta/bar <- "dir" containg all metadata
/home/stesmi/foo/.meta/bar/attrib <- some attribute called attrib
The file is $dir/$file. The attrib dir is $dir/.meta/$file.
The attribute is $dir/.meta/$file/$attribute.
If $attrib is something user-editable it's easy to
$EDITOR $dir/.meta/$file/$attrib
If this has already been taken up, I must've missed it.
