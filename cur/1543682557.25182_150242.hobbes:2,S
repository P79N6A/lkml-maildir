How?
Whether you put magic into the kernel, or you build a user space server,
the interface can be the exact same. I don't buy the 'integrates better'
argument.
It looks like you want simpler code in user space, at the cost of
complicating the kernel, for a feature that will be not be used very
frequently at all. Is this not correct?
