Well from a quick peek, there is some funny stuff happening in the
timer code.
- del_timer_sync() iterates across all CPUs, but does not do
  actually _do_ anything for each CPU.  (I suspect this may
  be the source of your crash - del_timer_sync() is bust)
- the back-to-back preempt_disable()/preempt_enable() is
  unusual.  What's that for?
- __run_timers() is doing spin_unlock_irq() inside spin_lock_irqsave().
  That's probably not a bug in this context, but it's a wart.
This help?
