The MD_FALLBACK_FRAME_STATE_FOR macro does not use sizeof(siginfo_t)
at all, but hardcodes 128.  (This has always been the case, and was
done to avoid the need to include signal.h.)  This is still broken
with the current kernel behaviour, though.
It is strange that I didn't notice the problem earlier; apparently
most of the places where unwinding through signal frames is required
use non-RT frames ...

As userspace expects a size of 128 bytes, and with the change
the size now *is* 128 bytes, why would a pad be required?
