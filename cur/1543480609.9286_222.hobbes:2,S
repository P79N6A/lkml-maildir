No, this is broken. The whole unixy API is broken in fact.
Consider these events:
1. you check the buffer - it is empty
2. a signal arrives
3. you select() because you think the buffer is empty
Time to rant!
I hate to admit it, but Win32 works better. All events arrive the
same way. They have a select() equivalent that can handle everything,
not just file descriptors. You can do semaphores with it even.
To get this in Linux:
Implement your own API in a library. For every kernel call that could
block or cause a signal, use clone() to get a new context. Results
must be accessed via a pipe hidden within the library.
Gross? Oh yeah...
I ran into this problem when trying to write a web server on
Digital Unix. (they have real aio_* calls) The stupid select()
call claims that a regular file is always ready to read without
blocking, even when the data is on disk. The stupid aio_* calls
won't handle network sockets. Signal handlers can't call most
library functions reliably. Ewww.
Blocking system calls were a bad idea. Signals were added to unix
to address the lack of a general event queue. Since longjump won't
get you out of one of those crummy blocking system calls, some
fool made signals interrupt system calls. As a patch on top of
a patch on top of a patch, app programmers need to wrap system
calls in loops. Patching the brokenness even more, we see Netscape
talking to itself to get around a stupid race condition. Since
the unixy API does not support dispatching concurrent system calls,
someone added the aio_* functions to "fix" it for the limited case
of simple disk IO. All along the way people find hacks for their
own immediate problem rather than fixing the API.
