I have the following Oops when attempting to boot test3-pre6 on my Dell Inspiron
5000.  Was previously running test3-pre4 with identical config without problems.
Relevant portion of boot messages:
Linux PCMCIA Card Services 3.1.11
  option: [pci] [cardbus] [pm]
Yenta IRQ list 0698, PCI irq 11
Socket status: 30000069
Tenta IRQ list 0698, PCI irq 11
Socket status: 30000006
.

.
cs: cb_alloc (bus 2): vendor 0x115d, device 0x0003
PCI: Enabling device 02:00.0 (0000->0003)
PCI: Enabling device 02:00.1 (0000->0003)
kernel BUG at slab.c:1042!
invalid operand: 0000
CPU: 0
I'll gladly copy the full Oops and post if that will help but hoped the problem
might just jump out at someone with this.
Later,
Tom
