AppArmor doesn't control IPC (which has been noted previously), and it
isn't clear how one generalizes its path-based scheme to handle all
kinds of kernel operations.  So it isn't even a very good jail-like
mechanism.  Which brings up an interesting topic of its own:  If you
want the AppArmor model, then why not just use existing jail-like or
virtualization mechanisms?  IIUC, Vservers and OpenVZ are already far
more complete in their coverage than AppArmor and leverage existing
kernel mechanisms like namespaces that at least have well-defined
semantics.  I expect that I could achieve a much higher degree of
confidence in such a mechanism than in AppArmor.  Why can't AppArmor
just become a userspace tool for configuring namespaces and setting up
the environment in which the application runs?

Again, it doesn't control IPC.
