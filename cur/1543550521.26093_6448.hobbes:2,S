There is actually some indication that part of the corruption people observe
after powerfails is caused by hardware scribbling junk data over the disk
in the very last moment when power levels in the system are already so low
that memory is already starting to fail while I/O hardware is still doing
their best to write junk data to the disk.  These days powerfails are rare
and so it's easy to attribute that to something else.
I'm now using ext2 since '93 or so and I haven't ever lost a complete
filesystem.  In fact in practice it's amazing how resistant ext2 is to
extreme data corruption such as caused by the good old problem of the kernel
and ext2utils having different ideas of the bitfield endianess ...
Maybe it's time to implement support for power fail / power return interrupts
where supported by hardware.  At least on Indy that gives you ~ 10ms to
stop whatever is going on before power finally fails.
