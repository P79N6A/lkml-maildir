    So I'd better go with the move-and-rename alternative...

    Well, my problem arose just a couple of times, when by mistake I
extract a tarball in a directory, or by a wrong 'touch' command
(related to some bad use of 'seq'), etc... Not a problem at all, but
curiosity about this.

    Ok, I'll take a look then :)) Thanks for answering :)
