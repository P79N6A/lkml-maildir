Hi Ladislav,

Please slice this into separarte patches. Adding support for the DS1339
is one thing, bug fixes are another. I can't review patches which do
that many different things at once.
As a side note, please avoid noise in your patch. Converting constants
from decimal to hexadecimal or renaming variables makes my review job
way harder, as it distracts me from the real point of your patch.
Once you realize that the time I need to review a patch increases in a
quadratic way (if not worse) relatively to the length of the patch, I am
sure you will see why it is important to send small patches doing just
one thing without noise.
Thanks,
