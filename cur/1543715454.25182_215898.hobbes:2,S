  Generally passing a file is not a problem - a lot of other syscalls
does that... The question is what would you like to do with the file
(you must be rather careful because you should not trust the contents of
the file, the contents can change etc...).

  The umount calls a filesystem callback umount_begin() which you could
probably use...
