yes that would be fine.  Like with your setup() suggestion, it is possible
to specify whether heavy_init should be called or not.  This is useful if
the firmware has already been uploaded - the probe() can detect this and
signal that heavy_init is not needed.
The main difficulties encountered with usbatm were: (1) avoiding race
conditions on device disconnect; (2) providing a way to cancel heavy_init.
As mentioned in my original email, heavy_init could run forever depending
on how the system is configured.  In the current implementation a signal
is sent on disconnect(), to indicate that the game is up, then disconnect()
blocks until heavy_init terminates, if it hasn't already.  A better method
would be to allow registration of a cancel() routine, which disconnect
would call before blocking on heavy_init termination.  This could send a
signal, or complete a completion, or whatever.  Sadly, the generic firmware
loading infrastructure doesn't have a way of asynchronously cancelling a
firmware load, so right now cancellation only does something if the firmware
has already been loaded from disk, in which case it cancels the upload to the
modem (which is the most time consuming part).
Best wishes,
Duncan.
