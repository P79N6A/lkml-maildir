Hi,
We have around 25 Digital Celebris FP 590 PC´s for our students here
in Vienna. Recently we tried to upgrade our Linux-System from 2.0.X to
2.2.X. On around 50% of our PC´s it worked, on the others Linux
hangs at boot time. It seems that around 50% of our PC´s have another
Motherboard-Revision, perhaps this is the reason for the failure but
it is impossible to upgrade all motherboards.
We tried to load Linux with LILO, loadlin and directly from a floppy
(created with "dd"), always the same behavior:
Uncompressing Linux...done
Now booting the Kernel
_
And here it hangs. Ah yes, the DEC-Celebris is a Pentium-100 with 32MB
RAM, an Adaptec 2940U SCSI-Controller, one IDE, one SCSI-Disk and
a Soundblaster 16.
Do you have any solution to this problem or do we have to get stuck
with the 2.0.X kernel series?
        Thank you in advance,
        Best Regards,
        Hermann Himmelbauer
