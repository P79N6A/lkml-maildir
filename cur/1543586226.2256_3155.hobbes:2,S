Subject: Mount locks on bad ISO image?

I tried mounting a file as an ISO image (turns out it was corrupted) - after
running mount file.iso /cdrom -o loop
mount hung and did not respond.. I could not ^Z it into the background, or
kill, or kill -9 it...
I'm certain that I have ISO and loopback support compiled into my kernel.
Anyone know what might be going on?
Regards,
Aaron
