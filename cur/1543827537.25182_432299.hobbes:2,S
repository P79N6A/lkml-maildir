Well, with CURRENT_TIME defined, for some time to come we're likely
to have new filesystems going into the tree, copying old filesystems,
using CURRENT_TIME but not setting s_time_gran.  Undefining CURRENT_TIME
and updating all its users would prevent that; but I don't intend to do
so myself, and it certainly wouldn't be a 2.6.17 thing.

There should be no need to change that one at all: it was introduced to
match the default s_time_gran of one second, so filesystems using it
are declaring that they understand all this.  Except for that odd
stray usage in JFS.

Oh, thanks a lot for double checking, that's a great help.

Right, I don't want Gentoo user impugning the safety of tmpfs:
I'll send just your patch on to Linus; but divide the rest up
to send to maintainers later (some of my choices may be wrong).
