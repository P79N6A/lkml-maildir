Two queues?
What elevator code are you guys refering to when refering to "current"
code? I just read the code for linux-2.4.0-test8 - that is the one I'm
comparing with.

Yes, decreased. elevator_sequence
But I now see I was wrong - forget that comment.

I agree that requests should be attemted merged with the active queue.
This will not solve the problem you describe, but it will help.
I don't think it should be two queues - I think it should be a dynamic 
number of queues. Each queue can have a maximum length (in time or 
number of requests), and when a queue is full, you start adding to the
next one. The queues are served in the order they were created.
My original algorithm didn't include priorities. I now think this can be 
fixed by having different ideas for "full" queues according to the
priority of the process.
This way you don't need one index by time and one by sector.
