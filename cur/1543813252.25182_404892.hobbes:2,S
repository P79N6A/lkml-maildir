I don't think there's any sane way to reserve for PRIVATE mappings.
To do it strictly you'd have to reaccount the whole block on every
fork(), and that would mean that any process using >0.5 of the
system's hugepages could never fork(), even if the child was just
going to exec().
Given that, it's simplest just to allow free overcommit for PRIVATE
mappings.  *But* you can ensure that PRIVATE allocations (i.e. COW
faults) don't mess with any previously reserved SHARED mappings.

No, I realised that distinction.
