I switched my config from up to smp support with 2 processors.
trying to modprobe powernow-k7 gives me now:
"
cpufreq-core: trying to register driver powernow-k7
cpufreq-core: adding CPU 0
cpufreq-core: initialization failed
cpufreq-core: no CPU initialized for driver powernow-k7
cpufreq-core: unregistering CPU 0
"
any ideas?
with kind regards
Thomas
