Can agree with you, but a modern cdrom should be able to konwn, is it open or 
not. This patch change basic behaviour for all cdroms.

Old behaviour has another problems, and revert to 2.4.20 code base is a bad 
solution. I have nothing against changing the default.
The patch must be minimal...
         
	if (sense.sense_key == NOT_READY) {
               if (sense.asc == 0x3a) {
-                        if (sense.ascq == 0 || sense.ascq == 1)
+                        if (sense.ascq == 1)
                                return CDS_NO_DISC;
-                        else if (sense.ascq == 2)
+                        else if (sense.ascq == 0 || sense.ascq == 2)
                                return CDS_TRAY_OPEN;
                }
         }
