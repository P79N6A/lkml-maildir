The unlock_kernel is correct, thanks.
In this case, the messae about the nonzero preempt_count is not a
problem - kjournald just exits without dropping the BKL because it knows
schedule will do it for you.  It is cleaner, however, to explicitly
relinquish the lock, and it removes the preempt_count debug whining.
So the patch is good - thanks,
