Subject: [2.4.1] "DEVFS+RAID" not working

Hi,
as I've posted before in [SoftwareRAID in 2.4.1],
I wasn't able to get RAID0 working
with devfs enabled and mounted on /dev.
The problem had gone after I passed devfs=nomount,
and used old device names for configuring/starting raid:
/dev/md0 instead of /dev/md/0
/dev/sda1 instead of /dev/scsi/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part1
and so on.
Why?
Is that the way it is supposed to be with raid?
Why can't I just use devfs naming scheme,
and mount it on boot?
For some reason I wouldn't want those old device files under /dev.
Thanks in advance,
Art.
