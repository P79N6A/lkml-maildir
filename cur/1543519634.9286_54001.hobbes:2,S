Argh no. You just broke your system. /usr/include/linux is managed
by the packaging system - you just don't go around and replace things
manually.
You simply upgrade glibc-devel to the latest version.
If you really need to compile against other kernel headers, you
can always use -I/usr/src/linux-2.5.13ac10/include/ And for that
to work smoothly, we need to fix the clash between the kernel
net/ and scsi/ include directory and the glibc one
