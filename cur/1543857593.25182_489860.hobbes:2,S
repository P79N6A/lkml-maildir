I have a problem where an ich6 (SATA+PATA) is getting its port0 reserved
by the pci quirk for libata so that it gets picked up by ata_piix. In
current git, ata_piix complains:
[  124.507570] PCI: Unable to reserve I/O region #1:8@1f0 for device 0000:00:1f.2
I bisected to the same commit, 368c73d4f689dae0807d0a2aa74c61fd2b9b075f,
however, your patch doesn't fix my problem.
