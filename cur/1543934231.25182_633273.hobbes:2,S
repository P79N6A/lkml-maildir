It's not.  It's perfectly ok to drive a PCMCIA bus slower than that,
IIRC we used a much slower clock speed than that on a StrongARM
platform I worked a couple of years ago.  
The PCMCIA CIS (Card information services) allows the following device
speeds: 100, 150, 200 and 250 ns.  The memory card spec also allows 600
and 300 ns.  The standard I/O card cycle speed is 255 ns.  I believe
that is "the shortest access time for a read/write cycle", and I can't
tell if that is comparable to one ISA clock cycles or if it's
comparable to 8 ISA bus cycles.
On the other hand, there is no clock line in a PCMCIA connector, so for
PCMCIA devices any delays should be absolute times, or based on some
clock that is internal to the card.  How that fits with the 8390 data
sheet talking about bus clocks, I don't know.
