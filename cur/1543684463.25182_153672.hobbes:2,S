Hello again,
> I will try S4 lateron.
After resuming from S4 uhci_hcd works fine (in opposition to S3 under exactly the same circumstances).
USB support was completely compiled into kernel and not as modules (therefore no unloading before suspend was done).
Interesting:
uhci_hcd wakes up again before power down.

(now using 2.6.0-test2-mm2)
