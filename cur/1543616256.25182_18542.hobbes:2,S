Perhaps.  But they are happy customers and their music sounds better.
Note: the dominating cost of -preempt is not Robert's patch, but the fact 
that you need to have CONFIG_SMP enabled, even for uniprocessor, turning all 
those stub macros into real spinlocks.  For a dual processor you have to have 
this anyway and it just isn't an issue.
Personally, I don't intend to ever get another single-processor machine, 
except maybe a laptop, and that's only if Transmeta doesn't come up with a 
dual-processor laptop configuration.

Was this on uniprocessor machines, or your dual Athlons?  How did you measure 
the performance?
