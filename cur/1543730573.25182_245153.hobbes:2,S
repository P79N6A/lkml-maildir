It's not nice because flushing 400MB of dirty data to the packet device
will take _ages_. That the vm will dirty that much data for you
non-blocking is a problem in itself. It would still be a really good
idea for the packet writing driver to "congest" itself, like it happens
for struct request devices, to prevent build up of these huge queues.

But it very well could have. If you dive into the bio mempool (or the
biovec pool) and end up having most of those reserved entries built up
for execution half an hour from now, you'll stall (or at least hinder)
other processes from getting real work done.
Latencies are horrible, I don't think it makes sense to allow more than
a few handful of pending zone writes in the packet writing driver.
