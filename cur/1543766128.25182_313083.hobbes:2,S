Hi,
can anybody help out? I don't have access to Intel 64 bit CPUs and need
some microbenchmark results on Intel 64 bit. Usage guide for the
attached archive:
'ref' contains the current generic AES implementation
'new' contains the 64 bit AES assembler implementation
Do 'make' in both directories and run the resulting 'aes' on an
otherwise idle system without any cpufreq (speedstep) stuff active.
Preferrably do multiple runs to assert that the results are usable (a
few ticks difference between runs are ok).
The microbenchmark is set up to produce somewhat real life results with
hot caches, thus the same data block is processed all the time.
