Please dont use 2.4.3 for verifying these long term. Its woefully out of date
for non x86 ports and many of the entries may well be due to this (eg
HOST_FOOTBRIDGE ARCH_EBSA285 etc)
Im currently working on getting the arch stuff ready to merge with Linus and
this patch will just make it a nightmare.
