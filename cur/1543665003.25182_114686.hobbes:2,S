Why stacks? is there a technical reason %fs has to point in the same
area as the stack?
If you just want to save one mmap/allocation: I think the context switch
overhead will be more expensive than the allocation.

The problem is that the context switch is much more expensive with that
(wrmsr is quite expensive compared to the memcpy or index reload). The kernel 
optimizes it away when not needed, but with glibc using them 
for everything all processes will switch slower.
I had hoped that user land would prefer fast context switches and
just stuff the index tables for the thread local data into the 
first 2GB (using MAP_32BIT). Yes limiting the thread stacks to 4GB 
would be bad I agree, but is it that big a problem to split the
index table for thread local data and the stack?
