This was my original idea too.  AIX has this, but in reality the
control ends up all in userspace for non-trivial uses.  ie. some
"workload manager" program consults with all the interested parties
*before* telling the kernel what to do.
The async and non-consultive nature of hotplug is policy for good
reason.  Giving someone 30 seconds to respond to a signal can always
fail, and making it configurable is just a bandaid.
I have nothing against SIGRECONFIG (think memory hotplug), but the AIX
guys indicated from their experience it seems that non-toy users don't
use it anyway (they have a hotplug-style script system, too).
So: trying to cover every corner case isn't worthwhile in practice, it
seems.  I like the signal for RC5 challenge etc, but that's about it.
Cheers,
Rusty.
