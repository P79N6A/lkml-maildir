Well, that's one explanation. Curiously, I've just managed to salvage
my floppy disk. My initial attempt to run either "mkfs -t vfat" or "dd
if=mini.ima of=/dev/fd0" failed, so I ran "mkfs -t ext2" instead. Once
that ran successfully, I was able to dd the image again, and this time
it worked.
Sounds like either a floppy driver bug or a vfat filesystem bug to me.
