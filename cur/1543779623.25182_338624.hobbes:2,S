Right.

Hmm.. At least x86 won't do that - the dirty bits are updated with an 
atomic read-modify-write sequence that only sets the dirty bit. We won't 
get a writable page somehow.
But the lost dirty bit is nasty.

Well, there is one really cheap one: look at how many users the VM has.
The thing is, fork() from a threaded environment is simply not done, so we 
could easily have a "slow and careful mode" for the thread case, and 
nobody would probably ever care. 
Whether its worth it, I dunno. It might actually speed up the fork/exit
cases, so it might be worth looking at for that reason.

Go for it, I think whatever we do won't be wonderfully pretty.
