No, the original question was:

so they are not trying to write to X's framebuffer but to a terminal,
i.e. to the controlling terminal of a process running inside xterm(1).
And that controlling terminal is accessible in the way I described (as I
am sure you know). I think you were slightly misunderstanding the question
the original poster asked. When you debug your module in a shell running
inside xterm you want debug messages in the terminal and not in some other
window or in the root, right?
