I had very similar messages (from memory), tried all sorts of different kernel 
versions, options, usb patches.... I even exchanged the usb cable. After a 
week I was ready to throw the **** printer out the window, when by chance I 
tried a shorter usb cable and it's worked perfectly ever since. I know it 
sounds unlikely (all the cables were within the 10ft allowed for usb1), but 
it worked for me. Might be worth a try.
