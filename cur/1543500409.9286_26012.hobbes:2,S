lost+found is a special case:  fsck is much more reliable at recovering files 
when lost+found has empty directory entries preallocated (otherwise it has to 
allocate a block from a known-corrupt filesystem, which can lead to
disaster); so when lost+found is created, a bunch of files are created in it
and then removed to preallocate entries in it.
