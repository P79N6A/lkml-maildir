More info: Seems there is an off by one error
I can manage to refresh the cursor position by flicking to another VT
and back. When the cursor reaches the bottom of the screen, for every
line output, the cursor moves further "down". So when I reset the cursor
position with a ctrl-l or go to some cursor position within an ncurses
app, then the cursor is now n lines below where it should be, where n
is how many lines were output once the cursor got to the bottom of the
screen.
I mentioned that I don't have the frame-buffer on. I removed all
references to svgalib from my debian sid install, and boot lilo with
the text menu, rather than the graphic logo. dmesg says there are no
strange args passed to the kernel:
Kernel command line: auto BOOT_IMAGE=linux ro root=303 hdc=ide-scsi
kernel build was 
Linux version 2.4.25-pre7 (root@scuzzie) (gcc version 3.3.3 20040110
(prerelease) (Debian)) #1 Wed Jan 28 18:42:00 EST 2004
Despite there being no framebuffer, when the cursor is hanging around
the bottom of the screen, the bottom of the display flashes blue - I
don't recall this happening until recently.
This is all on a Dell Inspiron 4000 laptop, with a Rage 128 Mobility
M3 video card.
