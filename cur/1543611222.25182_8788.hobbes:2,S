What? What happens when you open /dev/console then? The tty layer
redirects the console to some tty normally.
If this is the case then I will do it the way I started out. Having the
lock in struct console and sharing it with the tty layer. I was thinking
about a tty_driver just for the struct console list anyways. Currently
accessing /dev/console only effects the first console in the list instead
of all of them. If this is true then that means /dev/consoel can exist
without /dev/tty which could be a good thing.
