I think this would be useful for network daemons that would like to
fairly schedule responses (i.e. not re-arm until a client on a given fd
deserves a turn again). IRC daemons would appear to be a perfect
candidate for such. OTOH you may want to wait until someone is writing
such a beast so "it will be used" instead of "it is potentially useful".
