As Rogier pointed out a minute ago, one would have to do something more
complex than just usage counts. Because different loopback devices may
have used different (non-overlapping?) regions of the file. One would have
to do region management something like what is done with POSIX locks?
Or, better even, don't do stupid things as root and there will be no
unexpected results :)
