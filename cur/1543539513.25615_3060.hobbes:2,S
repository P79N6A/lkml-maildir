Urgh. That should be fixed at some point too, then. Everything userland
does with hardware should go via the kernel, and it should be possible for
the kernel to block/restrict that access.

Yes. See later.

Think about this: there are situations where root *MUST* be subject to
various restrictions (via capabilities, immutable files, etc). If root is
able to talk directly to the hardware, these restrictions become
unenforcable - security just went out of the window. This is unacceptable:
Linux must not do it. (Or rather, it must be possible to prevent Linux
doing it.)
