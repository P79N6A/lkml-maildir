If I run 3 cpu-hog tasks on a 2 CPU system, then 1 task will get an
entire CPU while the other 2 tasks share the other CPU (easily verified
by a simple test program).  On previous versions of the scheduler
'balancing' this load was achieved by the global nature of time slices.
No task was given a new time slice until the time slices of all runnable
tasks had expired.  In the current scheduler, the decision to replenish
time slices is made at a local (pre-CPU) level.  I assume the load
balancing code should take care of the above workload?  OR is this the
behavior we desire?  We certainly have optimal cache use.
