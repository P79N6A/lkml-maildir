But this is defined in include/asm/???.h  so you should be able to set something more to your liking 
(or rather to your archs liking).  It is true that it SHOULD be defined as it is used to define 
TICK_NSEC which is used to define the jiffies<-->timeval/timespec conversions which would be VERY 
slow it it were a variable.
