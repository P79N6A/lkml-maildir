I see.  Thank you.  I can live without it until then.
Btw, I applied Jens Axboe's loop-3 patch as suggested by Ville Herva.
It applied with some fuzz and offset.  However, when I booted it, the
kernel oopsed when I tried to mount the first ordinary ext2 partition
(no loopback involved).  I can post the oops if anyone cares, but I
presume that loop-3 and 2.4.1ac17 are just incompatible.
