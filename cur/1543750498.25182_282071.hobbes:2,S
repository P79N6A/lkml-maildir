Ehh, do you have any _alternatives_?

There is no complexity anywhere, and we don't actually emulate any 
instructions at all. The only thing we do is to check _whether_ the 
instruction is a "popf" - we let the CPU do all the work, we just say "ok, 
the instruction will set TF, so we should not touch it afterwards.

Let me count the ways that were wrong before the changes:
 - you couldn't debug any code that set TF. Really. ptrace would totally 
   destroy the TF state in the controlled process, so it would do 
   something totally different when debugged.
 - you couldn't even debug signal handlers, because they were _really_ 
   hard to get into unless you knew where they were and put a breakpoint 
   on them.
 - you couldn't see the instruction after a system call.
 - ptrace returned bogus TF state after a single-step

I suspect all the code can be shared. In fact, the change to send a
SIGTRAP directly rather than play around with "ptrace_notify()" etc is
likely totally architecture-independent apart from the calling convention
magic, so all of "do_syscall_trace()" could probably be moved into
kernel/ptrace.c.
The _only_ real complexity is actually following the silly LDT
descriptors, and we actually do that (badly) in another place: the AMD
"prefetch" check does exactly the same thing except it seems to get a few
details wrong (looks like it cannot handle 16-bit code), and only works
for the current process.
I assume you have that same prefetch thing on x86-64 already, so if
anything, you could look at my replacement and see if it would be workable
to do the prefetch thing too..
IOW, none of the issues involved are new.
