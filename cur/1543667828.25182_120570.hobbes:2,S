LVM or device mapper seems to be broken in -mm. I've only tried the
following kernels so far:
2.5.64 - works
2.5.65-mm2 - doesn't work
2.5.66 - works
2.5.66-mm1 - doesn't work
I'm getting these messages while setting up LVM from my bootscripts (I've
included the actual commands prefixed with a > ):

The only active volume is the most recently created volume.
On 2.5.6x-vanilla the output of vgchange is:
device-mapper: allocating minor 0.
