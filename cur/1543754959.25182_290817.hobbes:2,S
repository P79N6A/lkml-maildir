Looks like failing IO + close afterwards - umount is irrelevant here.
And oops itself looks like cdrom_release((void *)0x18, whatever),
called from sr_block_release().  Which is
static int sr_block_release(struct inode *inode, struct file *file)
{
        int ret;
        struct scsi_cd *cd = scsi_cd(inode->i_bdev->bd_disk);
        ret = cdrom_release(&cd->cdi, file);
and since cdi is at offset 0x18 on i386, we have
	scsi_cd(inode->i_bdev->bd_disk) == NULL
IOW,
	inode->i_bdev->bd_disk->private_data == NULL
at the time of sr_block_release().  Which would be a problem, indeed.
AFAICS, the only place that could cause that crap is
static void sr_kref_release(struct kref *kref)
{
        struct scsi_cd *cd = container_of(kref, struct scsi_cd, kref);
        struct gendisk *disk = cd->disk;
        spin_lock(&sr_index_lock);
        clear_bit(disk->first_minor, sr_index_bits);
        spin_unlock(&sr_index_lock);
        unregister_cdrom(&cd->cdi);
        disk->private_data = NULL;
        put_disk(disk);
        kfree(cd);
}
so we have scsi_cd refcount reaching zero (and scsi_cd being freed) before
the final close of /dev/sr<whatever>...
