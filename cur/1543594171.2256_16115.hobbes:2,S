Ok, I just tried that and my i8000 locked up as well. No problems with
2.4.5 as well. I have also another problem:
Running with -ac13 it doesn't poweroff properly - but it did running
2.4.5. Sometimes it just stops where it should poweroff and locks hard,
sometimes it blanks the display before locking up hard.
Alan, what other infos do you need?
