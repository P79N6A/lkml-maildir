Hello All,
    I think I may have found a problem with respect to module
autoloading.  While running the 2.5.53 kernel on a Red Hat 8.0 system,
I tried to automount an ext2 filesystem from a chrooted environment.
The mount failed with a message about ext2 not being supported by the
kernel.  If I try this and the automounter is not running chrooted, then
the module gets autoloaded.
    I must admit that I do not really know how module autoloading works.
I believe that the kernel exec /sbin/modprobe when it thinks it may
need a module.  My theory is that when a chrooted command needs a module
/sbin/modprobe gets run with the chrooted root fs and it cant see the
ext2 module that it needs from there.  I am not sure that this behavior
would be a bug, but I suspect it is something that no one has thought
about.  Could someone shed some light on this?
Thanks,
Jim
