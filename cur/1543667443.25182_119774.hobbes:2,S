           Summary: Zip drive parallel-port driver causes segfault in 2.5.x
    Kernel Version: 2.5.x
            Status: NEW
          Severity: high
             Owner: andmike@us.ibm.com
         Submitter: wa1ter@myrealbox.com
Distribution:gentoo linux 1.4
Hardware Environment:soyo k7via/single Athlon mb
Software Environment:gcc3.2.2/module-init-tools 0.9.10-r4
Problem Description: ppa module doesn't work properly and, if compiled into
kernel it causes a kernel panic at boot.
Steps to reproduce:compile ppa.ko as a module and modprobe ppa:
Error messages include 'scheduling while atomic' and 'oops: 0004 [#2]'
and 'unable to handle kernel paging request' and 'modprobe exited with
preempt_count 1'.
This same problem has existed at least since kernel 2.5.49 when I
started trying the 2.5 series, and I suspect that ppa has never
worked with 2.5 kernels, but I don't know for sure.  The driver
works fine with 2.4 kernels.
Note:  it is NOT necessary to have a parallel Zip drive to test this
kernel module.  The ppa module should load without error even with no
Zip drive connected!
