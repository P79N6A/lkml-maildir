Another confirmed "working" report.
If you're using devfs it's easy to tell if it's tts/4 or tts/2 or
whatever, but assuming you're not using setserial and you're using
the right ttyS it works fine (using the actiontec and IBM versions
of the same card, based on the lucent venus chipset, with
2.4.everything)
