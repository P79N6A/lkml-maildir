Look at the notifier lists in include/linux/notifier.h

But that becomes MAC-dependant again... That means you'd need 1) a way
for the MAC driver to ask the PHY driver what register it wants
autopolled, and a function in the PHY driver for the MAC to call when it
detects a change. Also, autopoll is broken in some MACs...

Nope. I think timer based polling with a sungem-like fallback mecanism
to forced speeds would be nice.
