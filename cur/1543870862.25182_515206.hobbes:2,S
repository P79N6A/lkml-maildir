We can use mincore and fadvise against /dev/sda1, too.
mincore's linear search would hurt but you could just run fadvise
regularly.  A lot of the blockdev pagecache is pretty useless anyway: we've
already copied it much of it into dentries and inodes, and some of ext2/3/4's
pagecache is already pinned by the fs.
