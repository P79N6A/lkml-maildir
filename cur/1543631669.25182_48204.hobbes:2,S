LGPL can be used as GPL. If you haven't even read the license do that

The RtLinux patent seems to boil down to "If you are free software we
are free software, if you are proprietary we play in your space too,
please pay up". Its not something I'm totally happy with but I don't
really see how else Victor can phrase it.
