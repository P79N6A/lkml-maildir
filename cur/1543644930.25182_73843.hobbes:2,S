Let me give a simple clear explanation here. I don't give a flying ***k
about modular IDE until the IDE works. Cleaning up the modular IDE after
it all works is relatively easy and gets easier the more IDE is cleaned
up. Until then its not even on the radar unless someone else wants to do
all the work for 2.4/2.5 and verify/test them
