Whoops, my mistake... :) I understand that copy_from_user should be called
effectively from outside of printk... but in my case, I was doign some
quick debugging work, adding lots of printk's and adding copy from user's
would have been "inconvenient".  I appreciate that it's the right way to
do things.   I'll through together a new patch that should be more
passable for everyone...
