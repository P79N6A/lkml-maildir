Hi Thomas,
compiling sis_main.c failed for me in sis_main.c with the following error:
<-- snip  -->
...
gcc -D__KERNEL__ -I/home/bunk/linux/kernel-2.4/linux-full/include -Wall
-Wstrict-prototypes -Wno-trigraphs -O2 -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -pipe

nclude -DKBUILD_BASENAME=sis_main  -c -o sis_main.o sis_main.c
sis_main.c: In function `sisfb_init':
sis_main.c:3273: structure has no member named `mtrr'

<--  snip  -->
It seems the following patch that from 2.4.19-pre9-ac3 is needed?
