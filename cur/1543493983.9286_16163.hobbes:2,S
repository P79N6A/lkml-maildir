This thread started with the failure of sed to work which (at least in
modern versions) stats the source to find its size and then mmaps it.
If you kludge the filesize to be fixed at 1000 (say) then sed will map
the first 1000 bytes (well, maybe rounded up to a whole PAGE_SIZE),
operate on that and happily ignore the rest.
Having an arbitrary limit for a fake filesize is bad. At least with
zero length output, it's obvious that something is wrong. If people
start getting bogus truncated output just because somebody hot-adds a
disk or some statistic gatherer ups the number of bytes in a /proc
file then it would lead to problems that are much harder to trace.
