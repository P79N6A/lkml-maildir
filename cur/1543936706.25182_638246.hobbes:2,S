Yes.
But this still leaves the fact that when someone says 'allyesconfig' 
it's no longer clear which configuration he has. And no, I do not 
consider it funny that this now implies two hours of compilation twice 
just for seeing one bug.
And the fact that I have to set ARCH only for seeing the 32/64bit 
Kconfig choice is clearly bullshit.
