commit dc386d4d1e98bb39fb967ee156cd456c802fc692 adds rcu_read_lock, but
some routines in the lock range might sleep (like lock_buffer,
aops->writepage), I saw a 'sleep in atomic' warning. It appears the
patch has several versions before. Doing rcu_read_lock in PageAnon
sounds break the case of PageAnon(page) && PageSwapCache(page),
as .writepage might be called. The dummy anon patch maybe is ok.
Thanks,
Shaohua
