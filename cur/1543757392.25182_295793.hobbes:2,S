Hi Stefan.
For Suspend2, we also put a device id in the space, so there's only room
for one character, which is a lower or upper case Z. (We also validate
the device ID, so a random Z won't cause an oops).
Thanks for the code. With your/Suse's permission, I'll ask Bernard
(cc'd) to include the script in the docs somewhere with the appropriate
credit.
Thanks and regards,
Nigel
