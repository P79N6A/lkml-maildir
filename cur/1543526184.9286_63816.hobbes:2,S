If you are using ext2 filesystems, you can use the ext2 filesystem "label"
instead of the device in /etc/fstab, so you don't get burned by drive name
or address changes.  See mount(8) and fstab(5) for more info (a newer version
of mount is required to support labels).
IMHO, the Solaris/devfs method of specifying drives by
controller/drive/partition is not much better than the current system,
as you still have problems if the SCSI ID is changed, or if you add a
new controller and the controller numbering changes.
Cheers, Andreas
