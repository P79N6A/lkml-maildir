I'm glad you found a bug in my epoll processing code (which does not exist
in kevent part though) - it took me more than a year after kevent
introduction to make someone to look into.
Obviously there are bugs, it is simply how things work.
And debugging state machine code has exactly the same complexity as
debugging multi-threading code - if not less...

Ingo, you draw too much black into the picture.
No one will crate purely event based model for socket or VFS processing
- event is completion of the request - data in the buffer, data was sent
and so one - it is also possible to add events into middle of the
processing especially if operation can be logically separated - like
sendfile.
