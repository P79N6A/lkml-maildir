Due to this 16MB hole, your BIOS has to set up a write-back range
covering 2048-16 (2032MB). Due to limitations on the way MTRRs work,
you can't do this all in 1, so you have to split it up over several.
The result is that you use up 5 MTRRs covering 1 range + 1 for the
unmapped 16MB. Leaving just two for..

So you really are out of MTRRs (There are only 8 on this CPU).
Does your BIOS have any option to disable this hole in low memory ?
I've seen similar things on laptops that use shared memory between
CPU & Graphics card, but I was unaware of anything like this on
desktop/server motherboards.
If this has onboard VGA, and theres a way to disable it, perhaps that
will work. (Even if it means plugging in a PCI/AGP video card)
