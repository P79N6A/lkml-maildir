I've seen such code from egcs-1.1.2, IIRC in do_softirq().
What about adding atomic_xy_local() to the normal kernel?
* raise_softirq() contains a local_irq_save(), we could remove that.
* i386 only: do_nmi() could use atomic_inc_local() for the nmi_counter.
Ingo, it seems you overlooked the global variable nmi_counter in
arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c when you added the variable to irq_stat.
Could you remove it?
