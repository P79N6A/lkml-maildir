Where would you put the flag? 
Doing it global may give false errors for the wrong device with async MCEs
and on SMP.
For putting it into the pci_dev you need to take logs to walk the list.
If you delay it to a softirq for safely getting the lock it would be set too late.
Putting it into a different table indexed by pci index would be also racy 
with hotplug.
