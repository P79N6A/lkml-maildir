There is some variance between tests.  On the 5 kernels tested bunch, 
2.4.16 was up for about 1.5 days before it's test was run.  (the other 
kernels were booted before tests) 
2.4.16
mp3 played 372 of 392 seconds (95%) fresh boot
mp3 played 312 of 371 seconds (84%)
2.5.1-pre1 was up for about 18 hours, and I re-ran the test on it.
2.5.1-pre1
mp3 played 361 of 365 seconds (99%) fresh boot
mp3 played 350 of 378 seconds (93%)
It may be normal variance, or fresh boot syndrome.
