Hello!

To select small snapsize (obtained from later experiments),
to set PACKET_COPY_THRESH to read larger packets via recvmsg().

Kernel has problems with allocating large chunks of memory.
If you see problems with allocating large chuns, split them
to less ones.

No. poll returns, when new frame appears.

see anser to question 1. It has a sense when size of chunk is small enough.
Small packets are copied to ring, large ones (which are truncated) are queued
to socket to be received via recvmsg().
