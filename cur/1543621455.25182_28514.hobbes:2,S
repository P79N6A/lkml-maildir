 Depends on the context of the change.
 In a majority of cases the answer is RTFC.
 If this is too much effort, rethink your outlook on whats
 involved as 'maintainer' of something like the Config.help's.
 This is precisely the reason that splitting them was the best
 thing that could have happened. They are now maintained by
 the people who actually *know* whats involved, so you don't have to.

 Reading diffs and finding out why things changed, and following
 conversations on Linux-kernel are the only way you'll know if
 something is relevant in other trees. If you've a robot that can
 do this, I'm all ears, as it could save me hours each day.
