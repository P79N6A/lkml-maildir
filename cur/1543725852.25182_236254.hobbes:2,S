I agree, but isn't it related to the fact that other desktop OSes usually 
don't run anything like updatedb nightly?
Perhaps we need a bit more sophisticated swap algorithm than other OSes do.  
For example, couldn't we add an additional parameter to control the swapping 
"behavior", apart from the swappiness?  Something like adding the second knob 
in my radio example?  Just thinking,
