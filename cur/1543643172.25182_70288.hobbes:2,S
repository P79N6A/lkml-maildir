Well, I'd reccomend reading the sources...
But, the short answer is SIGCHLD.  A process can get a SIGCHLD sent to it when 
a child process terminates.  Init maintains a list of child processes; when 
it gets a SIGCHLD, it knows that one of them dies, and restarts it.  
Obviously, this is somewhat oversimplified, but it's in general how to 
occomplish these things.
Hope this helps.  BTW, I'm pretty sure that this is coverred in a lot of 
books.  I'd start with the Stevens book (I don't remember the exact name of 
it off hand, however; something like "Unix systems programming").
