For those following this thread, testing is halted momentarily due to a 
bug in my amanda wrapper scripts discovered when I told it to do a flush 
so the next run had a clean slate.  Alan Pearson and I are exchanging 
emails on that.  The script problem however is not connected to this, its 
just that the wrapper needs to be right under all conditions and it 
wasn't.  A few hours lag here.
Does anybody on the Cc: list need off it?
