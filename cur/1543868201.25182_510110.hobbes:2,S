Which shows how that case is different from writing Linux drivers. For
example, looking at the example the OP was himself proposing a few
alternative approaches to work around the limitation they were hitting:
could just switch to static major/minors instead of dynamics ones, they
could skip sysfs, or they could even reimplement something like sysfs
themselves, or whatever other interface they deem useful for the purpose of
plopping in their own binary blob on top of it, sort of like what nVidia
and ATi do for their stuff.
