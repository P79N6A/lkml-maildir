And now kernel 2.6 files seem to be being parsed OK too.

GPL, LGPL, etc.
This is also useful for locating functions which can sleep, though of
course that can be done in other ways.
This utility works by applying a programming logic to the code semantics.
That bit's fine. What it's not so great at is resolving C references back
to the correct declaration, which results in under-reporting. I'll improve
that (mumbles, register actions to be carried out whenever anything
changes in the fact database instead of coding the inferences by hand). 
I'll undertake a survey of the current kernel.
