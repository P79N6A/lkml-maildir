First off, installing modules manually (using insmod) is not necessary
anymore.  Since you're using 2.2, I would suggest using the kernel module
loader (read /usr/src/linux/Documentation/kmod.txt).
Now to your actual problem.  You need to set up the dependencies for the
modules.  My guess is the reason the symbols won't resolve is because you
need to load a module that that module is dependant on.  'depmod -a' will
update the dependencies for all the modules.  After that, use modprobe
(possibly through the kernel module loader) to install the modules.
