From userspace, you can generate about 50Hz. From a kernel driver, you
can do 100Hz. Unless you compile your kernel to use a higher HZ value.
  while (!told_to_stop) {
     data = 0;
     for (i=0;i<8;i++) {
         set_dtr (1);
         usleep (1);
         set_dtr (0);
         usleep (1);
         data <<= 1;
         data |= read_cts ();
     }
     printf ("Got data: %d.\n", data);
  }
The "usleep 1" will wait for about 20 ms. That's the way it works on
Linux.  What's the max? You could implement your own udelay. If it's
reasonably fast, and the hardware allows "random delays", you could
replace the usleeps by udelays.
    int bogomips = 400; /* Adjust for your machine, calibrate! */
    void udelay (int usecs)
    {
      int t = usecs * bogomips/2;
      for (;t;t--);
      return;
    }
Then change the usleeps to udelays, and live with the CPU usage that
this generates.

No. DCF decoding works with the data-pin, this doesn't.
