The only performance-related complaint with cpu hotplug of which I'm
aware -- that taking a cpu down on a large system can be painfully
slow -- resides in the "write side" of the code, which is not the case
that the brsem implementation optimizes.  I think this patch would
make that case even worse.  So I don't think it's appropriate to use a
brsem for cpu hotplug, especially without trying rwsem first.
