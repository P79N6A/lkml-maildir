Axel, Richard,
you both reported a very similar problem to me (panic at boot on VIA c3
with 2.4.35.1 when built with gcc-4.1). I could reproduce the problem
with your configs here and compare the code with your working builds.
I finally tracked the problem down to a dirty trick used to prevent
do_test_wp_bit() from being inlined (Axel, you identified the right
file). Unfortunately, this trick does not work anymore when gcc-4.x
is used without -fno-unit-at-a-time, so let's use the correct method
instead. I really hope that this trick is not used anywhere else!
The following patch fixes the issue for me. Could you please give it a
try before I merge it?
Thanks in advance,
Willy

Subject: [PATCH] i386: do_test_wp_bit() must not be inlined
do_test_wp_bit() has a comment stating that it must not be inlined.
Unfortunately, the trick to prevent it from being inlined is not
reliable under gcc 4.x.
The simple fix consists in specifying the noinline attribute.
Tested and confirmed to produce the correct code for gcc versions
2.95.3, 3.3.6, 3.4.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.1 and 4.2.1.
Special thanks to Axel Reinhold and Richard Kojedzinszky for their
continuous feedback when trying to solve this issue.
