OK, I've just spent some time trying to improve this piece of
documentation. I'll send it to you and the i2c list in a moment, to not
overload this thread. Please tell me if my proposed changes make the
document clearer.

Only commenting on the i2c bits...

I don't understand why you insist on having a single m41t80_transfer()
function for read and write transactions, when the read and write cases
share zero code. Separate functions would perform better.

Still not correct, sorry. The driver is still making unconditional
calls to i2c_smbus_read_byte_data() and i2c_smbus_write_byte_data(), so
the underlying adapter _must_ support I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_BYTE_DATA and
I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_WRITE_BYTE_DATA (i.e. I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_BYTE_DATA), even if
it also supports the block transactions. Also, you don't have to check
for the availability of these block transactions at this point, because
you test for them at run-time in m41t80_transfer(), and the driver will
work find without them.
So the proper test here would simply be:
	if (!i2c_check_functionality(client->adapter,
				     I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_BYTE_DATA)) {
 		rc = -ENODEV;
 		goto exit;
 	}
