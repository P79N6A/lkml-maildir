hi all
Some time ago, I sent a message regarding what I thought had to be the
RAID subsystem. I'm more convinced that this is the buffer cache messing
up.
scenario:
read 200 large files from disk concurrently (for instance dd of=file01
of=/dev/null, dd of=file02 of=/dev/null &c.).
As this is a 2x120g IDE RAID-0 config, I get pretty good throughtput,
eveny though I'm reading multiple files concurrently (40-50 megs per sec).
But...At the time I've read ~800 megs of data (which is the same amount as
the free memory before I start), it suddenly slows down to a mere 1 meg
per sec.
But... If I try doing another i/o operation, even to the same block
device, it works fine.
Can anyone help me out here?
