If you run an ordinary 'C' runtime library, not something
that you wrote to interface with the kernel, then a return
value of -512 with a 0 errno value is not possible unless
you have code that is trashing something in user-space.
The interface, whether a sys-call or an interrupt, takes
the return value, negates it, and puts it into errno if
it was negative, then it sets the return value to -1.
This is common code for all system-calls, therefore
nothing you can turn off for a particular system call.
A possible problem may be that you are not using the
proper 'C' runtime library headers to define what
errno actually is. On many (most) runtime libraries
'errno' is NOT 'extern int errno'. Instead it is
actually a de-reference of the return-value of a
function that located the proper variable for your
particular thread! You can't create your own global
errno and have it magically updated.
