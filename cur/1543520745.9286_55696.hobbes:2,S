Hi folks,
    I was previously using the agpgart driver supplied as a seperate compile
yourself module to the 2.2.x kernel ahd had mo problems with it whatsoever.
I recently started using (messing with !) the 2.3.x kernels and found that
agpgart is included.
unfortunately, the glx driver for my matrox g200 card now refuses to see
that the device /dev/gart exists, although the module gets loaded by the
kernel.
I at first thought the problem may be due to a change in device number ie,
for 2.2x it was 174 and for 2.3.x its 175 ?
I may be completely wrong here ?
can anybody point me to a decent source of info for the agpgart driver in
the 2.3 source ?
has anyone got it working ?
I'm running 2.3.35 with modutils 2.3.9 on a Gigabyte GA-6BXD dual Pentium II
400 with a Redhat 6.1 distro.
