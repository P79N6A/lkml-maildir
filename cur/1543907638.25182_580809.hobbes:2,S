1. AMD K8 system with two HT chain: when acpi=off or there is not _PXM
in DSDT, still make numa_node of device get correct value. ...
/sys/devices/pci0000:80/*/numa_node will be correct instead of 0 for
all. ---- so far i didn't find one two chain AMD k8 based system have
_PXM in DSDT...
2. could use dev_to_node instead of pcibus_to_node.
3. complex? I don't think so. It just try to get bus_to_node mapping
from pci conf space and put into one 256 byte array early, and then
use it some link pxm_to_node.
4. make it support quad core opteron by change to scan four regs in NB
func1 intead of func0.
