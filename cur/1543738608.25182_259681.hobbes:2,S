Subject: CDROM support in ata_piix?

I have an IBM server with a SATA controller listed as:
0000:00:1f.2 IDE interface: Intel Corp. 6300ESB SATA Storage Controller (rev 02)
Debian's 2.6.8 kernel with libata works fine, except that the CDROM
(which is on a PATA port) does not appear as a SCSI device.  It's also
not seen by the regular IDE driver, because ata_piix has already
grabbed the i/o resources--I get:
ide0: I/O resource 0x1F0-0x1F7 not free.
ide0: ports already in use, skipping probe
ide1: I/O resource 0x170-0x177 not free.
ide1: ports already in use, skipping probe
Is there any way to get ata_piix to register my CDROM, or
alternatively to have the regular IDE driver handle it? 
This seems to be a known problem (it's filed as a Debian bug)--is it
fixed in 2.6.9-rc4?  I had a look at the -rc4 patch but couldn't tell
from the diff whether there's anything CDROM-related in there...
Thanks,
Doug
