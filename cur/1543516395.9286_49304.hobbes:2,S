check_region and friends should be used in 2.2, but check_mem_region and
friends do not exist.

Not directly, you need to mask it against PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK.
In 2.3.x, you can pass resource[i].start directly to ioremap.

Yep.  But 2.4.x will be out soon, and you can remove those ifdefs.  And
except for the base_address/resource changes, a lot of the changes can
be masked (removing the ifdefs) if you use a k_compat.h file in your
