On the same hardware netware 3 at least tended to beat us flat, but then it
wasnt a general purpose OS. I think what Jeff is trying to build is basically
a box that runs netware in the netware 3/4 style - ie fast and a little 
unprotected with a standard linux application space protected mode on top of it
- its an interesting concept.
