digging into it much deeper, dev_dbg seems horribly unsuited for our needs as it prints 
the pci bus address and al. That's a lot of information when we really only care about 
'eth0: ' perhaps with 'ixgb: ' prepended to it.
You end up with pretty much the same code that was there before - unless we make 
something common for netdevices and use that instead:
#define netdev_dbg(netdev, args...) pr_debug(netdev->name, args)
and then use this stacked in the driver:
#define ixgb_dbg(args...) netdev_dbg(adapter->netdev, args)
that would seem clean and appropriate, and since this bit of infrastructure is missing 
from netdevice.h, explains the current situation in all netdrivers (chaos).
of course, I'm completely not taking netif_msg_level into account yet here, which 
probably makes it a bit more hairy.
