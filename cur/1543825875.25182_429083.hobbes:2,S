The user override already exists, as do the appropriate warnings.  Daniel 
Drake just added a printk explaining why the device was not configured, 
although it doesn't tell how to configure the device by hand.  Perhaps a 
FAQ entry at www.linux-usb.org would be appropriate.

They probably will.  The question is, how far out-of-spec should the 
kernel allow by default?  200% is likely to be too far (your plugpacks 
notwithstanding).
