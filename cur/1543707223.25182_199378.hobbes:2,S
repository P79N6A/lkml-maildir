Wrong. UTF-8 can store UCS-4 characters just fine.
Admittedly you might need up to six octets for the worst case, but hey, 
since you only need one for the most common case (by _far_), who cares?
And with the same UTF-8 encoding, you could some day encode UCS-8 too if
the idiotic standards bodies some day decide that 4 billion characters 
isn't enough because of all the in-fighting.

Why do you think UTF-8 can't do this? Did you read some middle-aged text
written by monks in a monestary that said that UTF-8 encodes a 16-bit
character set?

Welcome to normalized UTF-8. And realize that the "non-normalized" broken 
stuff is what allows us backwards compatibility.
Of course, since you like UCS-4, you don't care about backwards 
compatibility.
