One of the patches was indeed: "Cleanup of trailing spaces, tabs, ...".
It's indeed not changing anything in the code, but since I am doing a 'general'
clean-up off all watchdog code, it seems only logical to me to do it properly.
Lett's assume that this extra spaces take a 100 bytes and lett's assume that
compressed we still have 20 bytes. Multiply this by the number of people that
download the kernel...
Greetings,
Wim.
