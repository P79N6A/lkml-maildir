patently wrong. Compare the bandwidth of PCI and the bandwidth of memory
controllers. It's both slower, has higher latency and uses up more
valuable (PCI) bandwidth to do PCI->PCI transfers. The number of
situations where PCI->PCI transactions are the preferred method are *very*
limited, and i think we should deal with them when we see them. But this
has been said at the very beginning of this thread already, please read it
all ...
