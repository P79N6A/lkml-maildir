Are you saying that the skbs do not migrate between the per cpu
pools (hotlist) if you have enough skbs in the hotlist/slab cache.
There is always going to be migration of objects between CPUs
even if you have enough objects per cpu pool.  There are other
elements come into picture such as memory reclaim etc.,
Moreover there is no guarantee that once a skb is allocated from
cpu 0 pool, it would be freed to cpu 0 pool.

If the per cpu SLAB pool is depleted, it goes to the general
slab pool. As I pointed out earlier you cannot eliminate this
completely.
BTW SLAB is where I started the investigation, I will go back
to that later. We can modify SLAB cache to hold more objects
per cpu, but that won't eliminate the migration of objects.

I am working on the problem I posted yesterday. This skb init patch
was done long time ago. I just collected data on new kernels.
