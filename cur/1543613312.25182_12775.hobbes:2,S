Yes. 
I've tried it and it made the outputs the same for me..  
Note that it wasn't as simple as a different output from the 
*configs.  Only after three consecutive runs of oldconfig 
(starting from nothing) did my config.out stabilize before.
As was noted, the only 'problem' was that it was hard to be warm and
fuzzy about the outputs producing the same kernel in the end.
