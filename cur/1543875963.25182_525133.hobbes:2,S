Just a note: when EDAC needs to unhide the overflow configuration space of
the 82875, it is because the BIOS hid it.  And some BIOSes actually reserve
the area of the hidden device in the memory map/acpi tables/whatever.
Intel's D875PBZ motherboard does this.  EDAC can and does enable the
overflow device, but it might fail to reserve that region because of that
the BIOS did (and that is not a problem, in fact it is expected behaviour).
I don't know if this affects this patch in any way.  If it doesn't just
delete this email.
