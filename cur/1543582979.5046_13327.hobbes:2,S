Kernel 2.4.2-ac3.
 FLAGS   UID   PID  PPID PRI  NI   SIZE   RSS WCHAN       STA TTY TIME COMMAND
    40     0   425     1  -1 -20      0     0 down        DW< ?   0:00 (loop0)
From a look at the source it seems that this may be normal behavior
(though I'm not sure).  However, it's still cosmetically annoying,
because it throws off the load average (a D state process is counted
as "running" for the loadavg calculation).
My loopback-mounted fs seems to be working fine, nevertheless, which
is a nice change from previous kernels.
