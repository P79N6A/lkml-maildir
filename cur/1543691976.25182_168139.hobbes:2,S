Ha, Linus - didn't you know I am always right?
But being right in theory - like you say, I have repeated these
things for many years - is not enough to submit a kernel patch.
The post of today was prompted by a mail about
certain USB devices:

So, now not only theory but also practice is involved, and
we must do something.
My post implicitly suggested the minimal thing to do.
It will not be enough - heuristics are never enough -
but it probably helps in most cases.
I wait a little for reactions, and hope to send you a patch later.
