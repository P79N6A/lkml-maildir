I am hving a peculiar problem:
When ever I am loading a few applications (XEmacs, KDE, gcc, 
VMWare) on my 256M machine(520M swap), my system goes for a 
run...
What exactly happens is the Harddisk just thrases and my computer 
slows down to a crawl. Only a reboot solves the problem.
However I tried something like:
swapoff /dev/hda2; swapon /dev/hda2
and the problem stopped... I run ext3 on /boot & /
Anyway can HELP me...
