 No problem. I'm using devfs, so I had to pass devfs names - the
standard ones as /dev/hda4 don't work.
My lilo conf:
image = /boot/kernel2_6
  root = /dev/discs/disc0/part4
  label = linux2_6fb
  append = "root=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part4"
and corresponding grub entry:
root (hd0,3)
title Linux_2.6
        kernel (hd0,0)/kernel2_6 acpi=force root=/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part4 ro
And fstab:
/dev/ide/host0/bus0/target0/lun0/part4  /  reiserfs    defaults,sync   1       1
