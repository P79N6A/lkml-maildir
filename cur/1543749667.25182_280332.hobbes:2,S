	Seem like something specific to Fedora or the bk branch
then because I'm running 2.6.10-rc3 under x86_64 and it sleeps as
long as it should.

---begin random quote of the moment---
Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.
My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.
He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound's the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.
The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep.
 -- Robert Frost, _New Hampshire: A Poem with Notes and Grace
    Notes_, 1923
