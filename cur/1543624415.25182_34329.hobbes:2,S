Basically we have to disable non-wake GPEs prior to sleeping - I agree with
Pavel that this should not be a config option. The real problem is that the
keyboard GPE should be flagged as a wake GPE, but it isn't yet.
What needs to happen is, when we are entering a sleep state, we need to
evaluate _PRW and _PSW objects for devices, and take the appropriate action
- I would bet that a result of doing this would be that keyboard (WOL too?
maybe) would be properly flagged as a wake device, so the call to that
function would but turn off its GPE bit.
