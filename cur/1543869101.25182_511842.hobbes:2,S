I'm sorry, but the patch applay against the latest kernel. Please, try
it.

My patch uses current backlight class support in the kernel.

That driver uses the backlight class support as my patch does into
pxafb.

I see.
I suppose you are the backlight support mantainer, so what do you
suggest to do to "make corgi_bl a more generic driver"?
I have to rename and modify it? Or just copy it to have backward

I should mv backlight directory from the video one?
Thanks for your suggestions,
Rodolfo
