Yes, the remaining 10% that I mentioned in the partially
quoted e-mail above.  As I mentioned there, most of those have
one (or both) of two characteristics (I do not recall any that don't,
but my memory is not perfect):
  1. They are problems of _any_ dynamic /dev
  2. They have been or can be fixed in the framework
     of devfs.

ISTR that many of those were type 90% issues.
NOTE: in the absence of devfs proper it will continue
to be implemented (badly and piecemeal) under /proc.
If the functionality is not desirable, why do so many
device driver writers implement their own versions?
