That doesn't make it correct. This same problem occurs in other drivers
and the usual trick is to set the pci mask to 32bit, allocate those
command buffers ready, then flip back to 64bit. Just be sure one thread
doesn't change it to 64bit while another is allocating commands. The
reverse is fine since an accidental odd bounce is no big deal
