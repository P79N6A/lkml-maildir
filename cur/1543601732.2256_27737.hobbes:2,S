Adrian Cox was working on this after I raised the issue on the list, but 
nobody got anywhere. All we knew was that there were temporary lockups 
appearing when anything was using the mixer.

I've emailed Jeff 2 or 3 times about the lock/freezes related to 
volume/mixer control, and never got a response, I'm not sure he's 
actually maintaining the driver. The last release of it from him was all 
fixes from someone else.
Adrian Cox was helping to track this down before, and is probably the 
best bet, I've CC'd Adrian to this. Unfortunitely I haven't seen any 
messages from him on lk in a while, so I'm not sure if he's on vacation 
or what.
My advice is, give us a patch! :) Since Jeff hasn't been heard from for a 
while, I can't see anyone, including Jeff, having a problem with this.
Is there anyone out there that could start maintaining the driver? 
Inactive drivers are kind of a pain :(
