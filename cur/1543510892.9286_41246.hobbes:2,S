while i think it is related (because hang occured while making same
operation as earlier, but in another phase), i'm replying to my previous 
report about "null pointer exception in do_IRQ".

while now i'm running 2.2.13pre12 and i just downloaded 2.2.13pre14 i
performed following as root in Eterm under Xwindows:
$ cd /usr/src
$ ls
linux  linux-2.2.12  linux-2.2.13p12  linux.13p12  megaloman  redhat
[^ link to linux-2.2.13p12;           ^ link to linux-2.2.13p12]
$ mv linux-2.2.13p12 linux-2.2.13p14
$ rm linux; ln -s linux-2.2.13p14 linux
$ rm linux.13p12; ln -s linux-2.2.13p14 linux.13p14
$ cd linux
$ rm -rf *
after that machine hard freezed.
when using 2.2.13pre11 machine freezed when perforing copy operation
(cp -r /usr/src/linux-2.2.12/* /usr/src/linux-2.2.13pre12 - but not using
'cp' but using midnight commander) - that was during upgrade from
2.2.13pre11 to 2.2.13pre12.
