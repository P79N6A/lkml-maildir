You may or may not be better served looking at the audit subsystem, but
it's unclear what you need. Some things you have to consider:
1) Do you want all reads/writes, or is open/close/mmap sufficient?
2) What latency do you need?  Does the monitor need to deal with it in
real time (the same second or so), or is "auditd writes to a logfile and
we read it from a cron job" good enough?
3) What are the penalties/failure modes if you fail to capture an access event?
