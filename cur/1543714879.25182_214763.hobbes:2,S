Looks like something was missed here.
arch/sparc64/kernel/signal.c: In function `do_signal':
arch/sparc64/kernel/signal.c:627: warning: passing arg 2 of 
`get_signal_to_deliver' from incompatible pointer type
arch/sparc64/kernel/signal.c:627: warning: passing arg 3 of 
`get_signal_to_deliver' from incompatible pointer type
arch/sparc64/kernel/signal.c:627: error: too few arguments to function

Anyone got any suggestions?
