Hi all,
the MAINTAINERS list of Linus' tree is still listing eth1394 and sbp2 as 
orphaned. This is certainly not correct for sbp2. Is it for eth1394?
Ben, I remember you wanted to have your contact added back in, at least 
for sbp2. In case this should not be true anymore, I'd volunteer for 
sbp2 maintenance.
