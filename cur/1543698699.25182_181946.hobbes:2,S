what I forsee happening is, if the mandation of modules is enforced, people will start writing modules that just export the module interfaces to userspace and start writing userspace drivers, which will just be slower and uglier than the binary only drivers being sent right now.  I know about these drivers, I use an nforce2 motherboard.  Fortunately, people have reverse engineered the network driver for this (and I do love forcedeth) and people have reverse engineered other drivers, or brute force hacked them.  And I'm guessing people will have to continue to do this until linux becomes common on the desktop.
