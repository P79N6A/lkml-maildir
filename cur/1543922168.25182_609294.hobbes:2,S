The intent is to give us a DMA offload for NIC-to-user operations.  At
the moment the ioatdma device is the only gizmo supporting this through
NET_DMA, and is the only DMA_ENGINE supported on x86.  As more devices
are made available through DMA_ENGINE on platforms that don't have
ioatdma, removing the "default y" makes sense.  I agree that this is
ACK-able, but under the "it should just work" philosophy, and with the
Intel servers coming out with the hardware support, it may want to wait
until there are more DMA_ENGINE choices.
In any case, I'll ACK this and let the maintainers decide on the timing.
