2. This is not a comment of i386 mnemonics. This comments the role of
   specific register in the following instructions.
BTW, linux-kernel readers: anybody is a volunteer for making the kernel size
counter 32-bit here? This would enable using the simple bootloader for
greater kernel loading...  (current limit is sligtly below 1MB)
Possibly some 16/32-bit real mode code mixing would be necessary.
