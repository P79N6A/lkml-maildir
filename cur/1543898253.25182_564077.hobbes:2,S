Subject: [PATCH] Documentation: improvement to volatile considered harmful (resubmit)
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

I'm resubmitting this as I didn't get any replies, this time CCeing 
proper people, sorry..
Kernel locking/synchronization primitives are better than volatile types 
from code readability point of view also.
This patch is against 2.6.22-rc6.

 Like volatile, the kernel primitives which make concurrent access to data
 safe (spinlocks, mutexes, memory barriers, etc.) are designed to prevent
-unwanted optimization.  If they are being used properly, there will be no
-need to use volatile as well.  If volatile is still necessary, there is
+unwanted optimization. If they are being used properly, there will be no
+need to use volatile as well. Also, they make code more readable as they
+represent their intent explicitly. If volatile is still necessary, there is
 almost certainly a bug in the code somewhere.  In properly-written kernel
 code, volatile can only serve to slow things down.
