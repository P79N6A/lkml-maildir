What you are showing, would probably show up by others if this were a
vanilla kernel issue.  I don't have an 8 way machine, just 2 way, but the
vanilla kernel is being used on many 8 ways out there, so I think you are
right that this _is_ a vserver issue.
Unless, of course, that the vserver is producing an obscure race in the
vanilla kernel that normal operations would seldom have.  Just like the
PREEMPT_RT patch has discovered many race conditions that were in the
vanilla kernel but were not often a problem.
