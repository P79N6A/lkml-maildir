This should be doing a return SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY.  DID_BUS_BUSY
doesn't do the resource contention counting that you want
(MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY will wait until a command returns ... presumably
freeing up resources before trying another).

Are you really sure you want to do this?  It looks like we'll be doing
this in cases where shutdown won't be called (like suspend). 
	host->can_queue = le32_to_cpu(iop_config.max_requests);
	host->cmd_per_lun = le32_to_cpu(iop_config.max_requests);
You might want to think about adjusting this.  For the single LUN case,
it's fine.  For the multi-lun case it may allow commands to a single LUN
to starve everything else.
However, these are minor points ... I'll put the driver in and you can
fix them up later.
