What would this interface look like?  Would it be a user<->kernel
interface, or a user<->mountd interface?
Tentatively what I was thinking of was having mountd fork off its own
namespace, use /etc/exports to construct a mount tree there, then pass
that mount tree down to the kernel using the existing exports cache
channel.  Name resolution in svc_export_parse should be done in mountd's
namespace, so I think this works.

Hm.  We'd have to add mount options to /etc/exports too if we were going
to do that, right?
