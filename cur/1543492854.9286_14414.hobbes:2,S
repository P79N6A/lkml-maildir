Ok, then let me show you why it's a lot less useful than stickable, with
another concrete example: named(8).  You say it should be fine for an
executable to have all of inheritable flagged, I say that named should
_only_ have CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE, all others dropped.  All system services
should still run this way, otherwise we're as open to remote-root exploits
as we were before.  True capabilities were well thought-out to give us a
better security model, IMHO.  If you just go and completely break the
capabilities model, the setuid0 solution just gets worse.  (storing uid
and setuid bit in headers is ugly, too, which is another reason I rejected
setuid0 as a solution)

Now do you see?  If it's not priviledged, then we haven't really made
progress. It's the principle of least priviledge we're aiming at, here,
and all binaries able to inherit all caps doesn't follow this principle.

As I've said, capabilities support is an obvious and large departure from
traditional UNIX security.  It's also better, IMHO.

What about CAP_SETFCAP?

I hope you see differently now.

OK, well, if you've read my next message then you know we've got this
licked.  (I say 'we' because it was Eric Biederman's idea to tie in the
immutable bit; the sticky bit just provides nice compatibility properties)
