Wait. "into generic code"?  Do you mean that we can't use them in generic
code.  The are not defined there, but are defined in the arch. They are
just used like the p*_alloc (without boot) equivalents (from vmalloc.c).

With the archs defining their own p*_boot_alloc functions, there shouldn't
be any hacks.  The arch can figure out what to do. I didn't want any hacks
in the generic code.
