hi,
 I finally got around to looking at this.
 It looks good.
 However it really needs the MSG_MORE support for udp_sendmsg to be
 accepted before there is any point merging the rpc/nfsd bits.
 Would you like to see if davem is happy with that bit first and get
 it in?  Then I will be happy to forward the nfsd specific bit.
 I'm bit I'm not very sure about is the 'shadowsock' patch for having
 several xmit sockets, one per CPU.  What sort of speedup do you get
 from this?  How important is it really?
