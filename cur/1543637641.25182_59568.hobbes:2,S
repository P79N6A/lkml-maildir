So he should port my sd patch to 2.5. All the data it uses is in a per-major
data structure. Currently, in most function it uses the kdev_t passed to find
the right pointer. But that's very easy to replace.
Of course, sd still assumes it gets a whole major and not parts of one. Other-
wise, more splitting would be needed.

That takes more effort than the change itself, I guess.

Would certainly be nice.
