Subject: locking between Redhat 6.0 and Sunos..

I have a Redhat 6.0 server running 2.2.12 with the following nfs patches:
linux-2.2.7-sunrpc.patch
nfsd-2.2.7-2.lockd.patch
nfsd-2.2.7-3.patch
nfsd-2.2.7-nfsfh.patch
It is acting as an nfs server.  I have SunOS 4.1.4 machine which is acting
as the nfs client.  I am not able to get locking to work between them.
When I try to do something, such as get mail I get the following error:
inc kira 28> inc -file millerlu
inc: unable to lock and fopen /tmp_mnt/khan/var/spool/mail/millerlu
However, interestingly enough this works in reverse.  If the SunOS machine
is the server and the Linux box is the client nfs locking works fine.  
Any ideas, 
Thanks,
Luke
