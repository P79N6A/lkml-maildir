Ahhh, I'm very happy to hear this. GREAT!!!

I couldn't figure it right, but I've rechecked simple 2.4.18 without all 
"pending stuff" and it shows the same numbers as 2.4.19-pre7+AA.
When I apply Ingo's originall sched-O1-2.4.18-pre8-K3.patch or J.A.'s the 
latency goes bad.

Yes, I know, it is more fun...;-)

Nope, it is my devel machine and I do "heavy" C++ VIS app and XFree86 DRI 
compiler runs in the background during browsing, mail, etc. --- "Normal" 
workstation use...;-)
My dual Athlon MP/XP is some days around the corner ;-(

Wouldn't start a VM flameware, again but -rmap didn't come close in VM 
throughput. 2.4.17-preX-aa-O(1)-rml was the killer.
Thank you for all your work!
