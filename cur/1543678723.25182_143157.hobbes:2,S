I have seen this problem ever since I started using 2.5 on my laptop. I can 
easily recreate it by pressing two keys at the same time, it seems that then 
something gets screwed up and he repeats one of the two keys 20-30 times when 
it stops.
I'll test with that clock=pit option later, when I have the chance to reboot.
