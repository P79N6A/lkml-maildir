Leigh pointed me to your post in reply to another thread (modify_ldt
failing on highmem machine).
Is there any special vmalloc handling on highmem kernels? I only run
into the problem if I am using high memory support in the kernel. I
haven't been able to reproduce the problem with 896M or less, which
strikes me as slightly odd. Why does _more_ memory trigger "no memory"
failures?
The problem is indeed not vm specific. the last -ac kernel shows the
problem, too (and that one still has the old vm, doesn't it?)
