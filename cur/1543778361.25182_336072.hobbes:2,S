Since these patches are intended only for aio reads and (O_SYNC) writes,
that still leaves most other users of regular lock_page() as they are.

Having the parameter enables issual of synchronous lock_page() within
an AIO path, overriding current->io_wait, (for example, consider the case
of a page fault during AIO !), and thus avoids the need to convert and audit
more paths to handle -EIOCBRETRY propagation (though it is possible to
do so as and when the need arises). This is why I decided to keep this
parameter explicit at the low level, and let the caller decide how to
invoke it and handle the return value propagation.
Does that make sense ?
BTW, there is also a potential secondary benefit of a low level
primitive for asynchronous page IO operations etc directly usable
by kernel threads, without having to use the whole gamut of AIO
interfaces.
Thanks for reviewing the code !
