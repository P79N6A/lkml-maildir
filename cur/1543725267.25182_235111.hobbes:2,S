The answer is simple: don't use isapnptools with 2.4 kernel,
drivers should use kernel ISA PnP subsystem instead.
Unfortunately the sam9407-1.0.4 is extremely ugly piece of code and
no person sane enough will touch it (for the good summ of money perhaps :)
So the real thing you need is sam9407 driver rewritten from scrath :(
