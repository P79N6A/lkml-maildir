No, user error.

Nothing wrong over here, except that your pointer is ONLY valid in the
sending process, and NOT in the receiving process.

Yes, which was to be expected cause "name" is now in the the message
structure.

No, it's right the way it is right now. You are making the mistake that
you think pointers are valid memory references among all processes,
which clearly is not the case.
Get the book "Advanced programming in the Unix environment" by W.
Richard Stevens. It's more than worth its price and explains SysV IPC
in a very thorough way.
