Hello,
unfortunately, the e-mail provider GMX has accidentally blacklisted
transmeta.com as a known spammer domain. If you want to receive any
e-mails from Linus Torvalds et al, you have to disable the GMX Team
AntiSpam List, or at least the total blocking associated with the GMX
Team AntiSpam List.
NOTE: This behaviour is a new default, so even if it worked for you in
the past, be sure to check your settings.
Regards,
Carl-Daniel Hailfinger
