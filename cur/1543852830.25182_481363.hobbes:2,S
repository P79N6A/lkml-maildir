Okay, my opinion now...
I think we should change the sysctl system so most sysctls simply aren't 
accessible through the binary interface.  The rest of them should be 
documented in one place, preferrably machine-readable.
However, I think having the binary sysctls available as a limited last 
resort is better than adding ad hoc system calls all over the place, 
like sys_mips.
