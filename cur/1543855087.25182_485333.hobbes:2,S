They were "optimized away" for a reason...

If you need further flags for dynticks, then to do it conditionally, but 
keep this as is (at least for now), keep it small for the simple stuff.
As others have noted your usage is confusing, something like this hard to 
maintain - every time a flag is added/changed, almost every user has to 
checked to insure the state machine stays correct. Keep the basic states 
separate and if it the flag field should be needed for other reason, it 
should be easy enough to convert. This is not needed for an initial merge.
(Same goes for the next patch.)
bye, Roman
