There is one thing that might spoil the device-mapper "just simple stuff
only" thing: moving active volumes around. Doing that in userspace reliably
is impossible and basically needs to be done in kernelspace (it's an
operation comparable with raid1 resync, a not even that hard in kernel
space). However, that sort of automatically requires kernelspace to know
about volumes, and from there it's a small step....
