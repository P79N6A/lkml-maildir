well, it doesn't really matter since the kernel enables the IOMMU 
anyway. if you want to change the size you can pass that as a parameter 
on the command line.

since it doesn't look like you'll get a bios fix for this you may want 
to look at building a custom dsdt. the kernel can load a custom dsdt 
from an initrd/initramfs. have a look at the acpi site (acpi.sf.net?). 
they talk about what's needed to do this. basically you can get your 
dsdt from /proc/acpi/dsdt and disassemble it using the iasl tools, fix 
it and then load it with an initrd. note that this is not really a 
trivial task :-(

i've seen this before.. i think this may be related to the timer 
override not being done for your system (again strangely a bios bug...). 
why don't you try passing acpi_skip_timer_override on the command line.

i think this may well be related to the ACPI issues you are having, 
since this is how the information is normally gathered.
