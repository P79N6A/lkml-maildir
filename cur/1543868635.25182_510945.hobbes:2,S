Well, there are a lot of users of vm_operations_struct that have no interest in
the operations in pagetable_operations_struct. Expanding vm_operations_struct
would increase the size of all VMAs by more than is necessary.
Also, having the pagetable ops in vm_operations_struct might lead device
drivers to believe they should be doing something entertaining there. In
reality, we would only want drivers playing with pagetable_operations when
they really know what they are doing and why.  Having the pagetable_ops
set is similar to VM_HUGETLB set as a strong sign that something unusual is
going on that is fairly easy to check for.
I prefer the additional struct to extending VMAs anyway.
