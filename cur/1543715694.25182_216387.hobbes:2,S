Subject: [BK PATCH] 2 more USB fixes for 2.6.6-rc2

Hi,
Here are two small patches that fix an oops in the usb hiddev driver.
This oops was exposed due to a sysfs patch that I previously sent you
(that patch was correct, the hiddev driver was wrong...)  They have been
acked by Vojtech.
Please pull from:  bk://kernel.bkbits.net/gregkh/linux/fix-2.6
Patches will be posted to linux-usb-devel as a follow-up thread for
those who want to see them.
thanks,
greg k-h
