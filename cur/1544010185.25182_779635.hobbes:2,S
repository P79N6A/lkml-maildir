Heh, I run into this part again and as I have a long term memory of a 
goldfish I had to look up the discussion we had. So may I suggest you 
change the comment to:
/*

  * one has a reference to it), we want to make sure kmemleak does not
  * treat the ->s_mem pointer as a reference to the object. Otherwise

For this, maybe something like this:
/*
  * To avoid a false negative, if an object that is in one of the
  * per-CPU caches is leaked, we need to make sure kmemleak doesn't
  * treat the array pointers as a reference to the object.
  */

Do you take care of the per-node lists as well?
