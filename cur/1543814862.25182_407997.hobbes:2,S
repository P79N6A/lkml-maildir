But the app isn't buggy, it's just not coded to some arbitrary spec.
Further, an arbitrary spec that *the kernel didn't implement*. The app
author could very well have been competent and tested that behavior in
a ten line program (I do that sort of code *all the time* to test
corner cases that aren't clear in man pages). Once tested, they found
out -1 is an effectively infinite timeout, went "Hey, cool, that makes
sense", and went on with their day.
You're now arguing that we should break apps -- possibly well tested
apps -- because they didn't implement a spec that the kernel itself
wasn't implementing.
That's just nuts.

You're assuming that the apps that we'd break are incorrect. That's a
big assumption. Try imagining instead that it's a well-tested app that
passed QA with flying colors on a previous version of the kernel. They
exist. Honest.
