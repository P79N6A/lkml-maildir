Hi,
Increasing the IO bitmap size has huge effects on your Task State Segment 
size. It sure is possible to increase that size, but be aware that this means 
you are using megabytes for your TSS's only !
Of course, with current memory sizes, some might say "why bother", but IMHO it 
is still a very good reason not to do it. The Embedded guys will sure agree 
with me. 
Running iopl(3) isn't that bad, as long as your code knows what it is doing... 
Ioperm is only needed for virtual 8086 mode (aka DOS emulation mode) and is 
nice for buggy code. (If you don't trust your own programming skills and 
think you might pass wrong parameters to outb() ) 
You need root privileges for both iopl and ioperm requests, so that is no 
argument eighter. The fact your software runs setuid root automatically means 
you trust the software.
With this in mind, dosemu is the only reason why the bitmap should be 
extended. (virtual 86 mode uses the bitmap to emulate io access when needed). 
In my humble opinion, dosemu is not important enough to make TSS's huge 
bloated things by default.
The advantage for XFree would be that it needs to call ioperm() a thousand 
times instead of calling iopl() once. That sure is an advantage in my eyes... 
Well... it might be an option in the kernel on x86 systems: [ ] bloat kernel 
memory usage with huge TSS's, but I really thing this should not be the 
default way to go.
