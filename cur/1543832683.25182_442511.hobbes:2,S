Eventually, I'm the one who's going to maintain the code, most
of the drivers in the video directory are practically abandoned. 
Additionally, this is mentioned in Documentation/CodingStyle.
2) #ifdefs are ugly
Code cluttered with ifdefs is difficult to read and maintain.  Don't do
it.  Instead, put your ifdefs in a header, and conditionally define
'static inline' functions, or macros, which are used in the code.
Let the compiler optimize away the "no-op" case.
Simple example, of poor code:
	dev = alloc_etherdev (sizeof(struct funky_private));
	if (!dev)
		return -ENODEV;
	#ifdef CONFIG_NET_FUNKINESS
	init_funky_net(dev);
	#endif

Use select.
