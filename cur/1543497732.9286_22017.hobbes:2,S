Unfortunately they aren't valid because Apache is designed for the real
world not test labs. The test lab proceedures used by all parties I know of
are an absolute joke and people now are forced by marketing to write
web servers that suck for real use but do the benchmark well
What kills real world http performance is _slow_ connections, fast ones are
actually less of an issue.
Linux can do very high speeds with Zeus and with Zab's new httpd, but as
I suggested to Zab, his httpd ought to come with an "optimised for benchmarking"
sticker.
IMNSHO there are no valid comparison benches available. That is a problem and
not just for Apache.
