Acknowledgement has always been one of the kernel's weaknesses it seems,
given the recent issues on other subjects. But it's not always easy either,
especially when you just change sparse parts of code based on someone else's
analysis. I personally do credit people in the GIT changelogs for their ideas
or patches, but that does not appear in the code.

I don't know. But I observe that you're very efficient at building the road
you want him to walk on.

In my opinion, you're screaming in a language he does not understand, and
when he proposes random responses, you don't understand them either. That
game can last very long. You want to speak maths, he cannot. He wants to
speak patches, you cannot. I'm not saying one is better than the other, but
I know for sure that the common language here on LKML is patches. So my
conclusion is that you need someone to act as a translator when you want
to communicate here. It should be a very hard work, BTW!

Maybe there was a very prominent side then. I might be wrong in my analysis,
but I cannot find any other interpretation, there are too many coincidences,
and I don't believe in that, especially from smart people ;-)
