    Undocumented where? If the section 2 describes Linux syscalls it is *the*
    place to document it. If the whole thing describes something other than
    Linux kernel API - all bets are off and we'ld better start section 9 in
    /usr/src/linux/Documentation/man/man9/ in parallel to man2. It's not to
    criticize, but only to learn ;-) Seriously, if the stuff in /usr/man/man2
    is not intended to describe Linux kernel API (e.g. represents a relevant
    part of POSIX in man format - *good* thing to have somewhere) I am going
    to start man9 or man2L myself - I know enough *roff and VFS to do that ;-)
I would be very happy.
    Could you clarify the situation?
Well, I am the maintainer of the Linux man pages, but not the author,
even though I wrote a number of them. So, if you contribute man pages
about ext2 attributes or about capabilities or so, or anything else
for that matter that you deem needs documenting, and at first sight
your text looks reliable, I'll be very happy to include it in the
man page collection.
In this particular case, the string `immutable' does not yet occur in any
man page. I am not going to add it to the rename.2 man page. There has to
be a separate man page about these attributes, and once it exists we may
consider adding references to it on other pages.
Note that `immutable' is not POSIX, not even Linux, but ext2.
Probably what you want is a page ext2-attributes.4 or so.
There may be references from/to chattr.1 / lsattr.1.
