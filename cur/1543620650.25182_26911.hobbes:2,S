I keep the following in my .bashrc and use the `agent' command to
initialize the ssh-agent.
# Allow `agent' to start the ssh-agent usefully on all running
# bash instances.  SIGQUIT was chosen because it is ignored by
# bash by default, even in non-interactive shells, so that a
# shell not trapping it by some chance won't be terminated.
if test -f ~/.ssh/agent; then 
    . ~/.ssh/agent
fi
function agent {
    killall -q ssh-agent
    ssh-agent > ~/.ssh/agent
    killall -QUIT bash >/dev/null 2>&1
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/identity
    ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_dsa
}
trap -- '. ~/.ssh/agent' SIGQUIT
