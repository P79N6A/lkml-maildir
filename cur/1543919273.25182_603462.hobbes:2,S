OK. I did some debugging in this initio.c driver. I put printk
statements at the beginning of each routine and I got the following
output:
initio_se2_rd
initio_se2_instr
(The previous two routines repeat a bunch of times then I get:)
initio_stop_bm
i91u: PCI Base=0xEC00, IRQ=0, BIOS=0x0000, SCSI ID=7
i91u: Reset SCSI Bus...
initio_reset_scsi
scsi2: Initio INI-9X00U/UW SCSI device driver
i91u_queuecommand
initio_alloc_scb
So it seems to be dieing in initio_alloc_scb. I think it is dieing on
the first spin lock if that makes any sense, but it could be dieing
somewhere else in that routine. Hope this helps.
