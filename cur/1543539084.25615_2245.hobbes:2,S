I've had a bit of a try with 2.3.99 onwards, and can only get the floppy
to work if it is a module.  Built-in gives about 100 lines of errors
on an attempt to mount a floppy, the main feature appears to be a
complaint that the I/O addresses for the floppy are already in use, which
according to /proc/ioports are still free.
In 2.2.x built-in is fine.
Does the floppy code depend on something else in the kernel I may have
turned off?
