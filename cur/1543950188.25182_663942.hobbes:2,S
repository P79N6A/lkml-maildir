Hi,
According to i386 psABI,
---
The direction flag must be set "forward" direction before entry and
upon exit from
a function.
---
So, asm statement should make sure that the direction flag is cleared before
function returns and kernel should make sure that the direction flag is cleared
when calling a signal handler.
