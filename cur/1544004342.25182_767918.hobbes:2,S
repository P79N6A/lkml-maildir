With the trivial fix to patch 5 I sent earlier, I've been running the
following e2loop.sh for a few hours with no problems (the counter is at
2412).  Also did 500 concurrent checkpoints of the same process.
Oren, can you re-post an updated patch 5?
Andrew, would you mind (once Oren reposts patch 5) giving the
first 11 patches a chance in -mm?
thanks,
