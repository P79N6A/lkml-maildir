There is also a CONFIG_VIRTUALIZATION and a CONFIG_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING (from
s390 and powerpc) Which one to use ?
I'm wondering if we can have a more accurate accounting:
- For the moment we add all system time since the previous entering to the VCPU
to the guest time (and I guess there is some real system time in it ???)
- Perhaps we can sum nanoseconds spent in the VCPU and add it to cpustat when
these ns are greater than 1 ms ? (I'm trying to make something in this way)

it should be easy to do too...
