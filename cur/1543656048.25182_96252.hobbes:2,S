Hi Joseph
I'm not familiar with the phrase 'union mount' and although google gives 
wads of hits, I can't find a good description of it
What I mean is (contrived example with made-up mount option --overlay)
mkdir a
echo "a/x" > a/x
echo "a/y" > a/y
echo "a/z" > a/z
mkdir b
echo "b/y" > b/y
mkdir c
echo "c/z" > c/z
mkdir d
mount --bind a d
mount --bind --overlay b d
mount --bind --overlay c d
cat d/x
"a/x"
cat d/y
"b/x"
cat d/z
"c/z"
This would be *really* useful and nice. I currently emulate this 
behavior with a bash script which creates hard or soft links, but the 
mounting system would be much nicer, easier to unwind etc.
I assume this isn't possible now (man mount gives no hint), but how 
feasible is it? Has anybody tried to implement this? If yes and No 
perhaps I could (with some initial guidance) have a look at implementing 
this.
I don't use HD's much anymore, so it would need to work for tmpfs.
