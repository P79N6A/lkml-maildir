   We're planning to isolate the write functions as much as possible.
   In the past, we've been bitten by this whole concept of Linux "raw I/O".
   When I was at SGI, we were able to write to a block device directly
   through low-level driver functions that weren't inhibited by any
   locking, and that was after shutting down all processors and any
   other outstanding interrupts.  For Linux, I had given up and stuck
   with the raw I/O interpretation of kiobufs, which is just flat out
   wrong to do for dumping purposes.  Secondly, as Linus said to me a
   few weeks ago, he doesn't trust the current disk drivers to be able
   to reliably dump when a crash occurs.  Don't even ask me to go into
   all the reasons kiobufs are wrong for crash dumping.  Just read
   the code -- it'll be obvious enough.
Oh, yeah, I could have told you that from the beginning.  kiobufs were
never intended to be crash-dump friendly.  :-)   My preference would be
that each block device that was going to be doing crash dumping would
use a special busy-looping driver that's guaranteed never to fail.
(Sort of like how the serial console driver is done; it's separate from
the rest of the driver, and does not depend on interrupts working.)
Hence my comment about putting that separate bit of code in a page which
is write-protected and segregated from everything else....
