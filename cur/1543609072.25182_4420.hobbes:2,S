Subject: More dependencies on CONFIG_SMP

Looking at arch/i386/config.in
if [ "$CONFIG_SMP" = "y" -a "$CONFIG_X86_CMPXCHG" = "y" ]; then
   define_bool CONFIG_HAVE_DEC_LOCK y
fi
endmenu
and arch/i386/lib/Makefile
.obj-$(CONFIG_HAVE_DEC_LOCK) += dec_and_lock.o
We need to have SMP set inorder to use dec_and_lock. The file fs/dcache.c
in function dput uses a function atomic_dec_and_lock function, which is
defined in dec_and_lock.c. I think the SMP dependency should go
If this patch is ok, please apply
