I made a randconfig, and got the following error:
net/sched/cls_flow.c: In function 'flow_dump':
net/sched/cls_flow.c:598: error: 'struct tcf_ematch_tree' has no member named 'hdr'
make[2]: *** [net/sched/cls_flow.o] Error 1
make[1]: *** [net/sched] Error 2
make: *** [net] Error 2
seems it's caused by the following config options:
CONFIG_NET_EMATCH=n
CONFIG_NET_CLS_FLOW=y
