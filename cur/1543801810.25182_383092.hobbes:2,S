Tried to get this running with CONFIG_PTSHARE and CONFIG_PTSHARE_PTE on
s390x. Unfortunately it crashed on boot, because pt_share_pte
returned a broken pte pointer:

This is wrong. A pmd_val of 0 will make pmd_present return true on s390x
which is not what you want.
Should be pmd_clear(&spmde).

Should be pud_clear, I guess :)
Thanks,
