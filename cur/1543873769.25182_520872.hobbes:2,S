'just to remove a module' is very, very rare, on the timescale of most 
kernel ops. Almost no distro does it. Furthermore, because we want to do 
CPU-hotplug that way, we really want to make 
freeze_processes()/unfreeze_processes() 'instantaneous' to the human - 
and it is that already. (if it isnt in some case we can make it so)
