Ugly. There is already a define DRIVE_INFO for this right hand side:
  setup.h:#define PARAM (boot_params)
  setup.h:#define DRIVE_INFO (*(struct drive_info_struct *) (PARAM+0x80))

Hmm. setup.c copies this info from where it was left after booting
to some safe place. You seem to think that this saving is not required.
Is it not?
