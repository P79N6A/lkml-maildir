What do you mean by `traditional' here?
Do you mean last year's Linux? Or are you thinking of other systems?
I think I showed that Unix V6 has this what you call "vertical"
behaviour. That is, after the mount the inode points to the
mounted filesystem, and all names under which it is known,
like /path or . or .. will lead to the mounted filesystem.
[That is, if we compare with traditional Unix, we are fine today.
But if we also compare with POSIX, there is a difference.
Alexander says: forget about that, POSIX doesnt know about mount.
That is a point of view.]
