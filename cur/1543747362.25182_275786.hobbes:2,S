Just my point of view, but I'd love to have /usr/include/linux and 
/usr/include/asm linked to the headers for the currently running kernel.
For a while I was playing with adding a bunch of new syscalls, and it sure would 
have been nice to be able to just include <asm/unistd.h> and get the up-to-date 
syscalls for whatever kernel I happened to be running.
I've since switched to using a device node and doing ioctl() calls to get around 
this, but the issue still stands as I need to either import the ioctl() command 
numbers and data types, or else I have to duplicate the header in userspace and 
keep the two versions up to date.
