Changing to a limited set of IDs is interesting, I have never looked at 
what happens when a thread does setuid, and neither the man page or a 
very quick look at the code tells me. But the portable way is to do the 
things needed for init, then fork into three processes and give each a 
UID as needed. I would really evaluate the design which made this 
necessary, to see if some IPC could be used. Certainly that's more 
likely to be portable.
