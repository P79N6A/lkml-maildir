Current released version is 2.2.0.18 and is available from Debian (and
maybe RedHat and others) and from its primary site
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/pub/linux/ncpfs/latest.
 
Latest beta version is 2.2.0.19.pre42, and is avaialble from
ftp://platan.vc.cvut.cz/private/ncpfs
 (and is packaged in experimental
Debian, AFAIK).
2.2.0.19 supports TCP mode of NCP, while 2.2.0.18 supports UDP/IPX only.
2.2.0.18 compiles on libc5/glibc2.x, while 2.2.0.19 currently compiles
on glibc2.2 only.
