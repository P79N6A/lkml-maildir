I have recently run into a problem with the tulip driver on my laptop.
It loads fine at first, and I can get connected to a network, etc.  When 
I reboot the machine, it hangs when it tries to load the tulip module. 
This only happens with a warm reboot, not a cold boot.  It is quite 
repeatable.  If I power off completely, there is no problem.  If I 
comment the tulip driver out of my startup scripts, there is no problem. 
  If I reboot, it hangs.
This does not happen with the 2.4.5 kernel, only the 2.4.17.  These are 
the only  2 I have tried.
I have found that if I bring down my ethernet interface and unload the 
tulip module before the warm reboot, the system will not lock when it 
comes back up, so I have added the neccessary commands to my shutdown 
scripts.  However, it seems to me like a kernel bug that should probably 
be fixed.
My specific hardware/software config is:
HP Pavillion XH555 laptop with:
1 Ghz Athlon 4
512 MB RAM
ESS sound/modem  (sound using Maestro3 driver)
Accton ethernet   (using tulip driver)
Software:
Slackware 8.0, kernel 2.4.17
using ACPI, tulip, maestro3, ext3, framebuffer, etc.
If there's any more info that would help, please let me know.
