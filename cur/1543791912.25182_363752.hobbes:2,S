I would agree with that and further, is that not a bit draconian?  
HFSPlus is designed to work without the journal.  Just change the last 
mounted version to FSK! (0x46534b21) and everything will work as expected, 
i.e. fsck will run a check instead of ignoring the volume and osx will 
mount the volume and reinitialize the journal.  Remember older OSX 
versions did not support journalling so if you attached your external 
drive to one of those older osx boxes, you would also get non-journalled 
writes to a journalled volume.  It's all designed for it...
Best regards,
	Anton
