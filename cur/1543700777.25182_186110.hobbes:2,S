 Sure, sorry for not doing it earlier:

The Synaptics driver used is 0.12.2, compiled for myself, evdev is in
module, but ofcourse it's loaded before XFree86 starts. (I have stripped
down the files a bit, if you would like to see the whole files or other
parts, please ask - I thought it would be easier to see the relevant
lines only). gpm is configured by /etc/gpm.conf , but it should be:
gpm -m /dev/psaux -t ps2 -R raw
Also, the XFree86 Synaptics driver prints this while starting and
switching between console and XFree86:
Synaptics DeviceInit called
SynapticsCtrl called.
Synaptics DeviceOn called
Synaptics DeviceOff called
[the last two repeated more times]
> Btw, what version of GPM are you using?
 I am running Debian Sid, thus I also thought gpm is the newest; as I
do understand I should use 1.20.1, which is the latest AFAIK. Thus I was
shocked a bit on what 'dpkg -l gpm' gives:
ii  gpm            1.19.6-12.1    General Purpose Mouse Interface
More than a year old! Already filed an important bug on this. Sorry, it
seems to be the problem, or at least produces strange behavior:
I plugged in an USB mouse, which works while the touchpad still not
under XFree86 (both works at the same time under console - even if I did
not specified any additional config for gpm). The config for XFree86:

Made it the only one pointer input. Now, if I kill gpm with 'gpm -k',
then the touchpad begins to work! Sometimes if I release it, then the
pointer jumps a bit from where I pointed it, but that's all. I'm not
good in mice stuff, so I can't explain this. Anyway, I will try to
compile a newer gpm, change it's device, so play a bit; maybe I can come
up with something.

 It did not help. :-(
Thanks, and Merry Christmas!
