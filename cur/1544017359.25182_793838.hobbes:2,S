Very nice patch!
Jens, i'm wondering what's your take on this direction is. I think the 
consolidation effect is great and the built-in IO tracing capabilities are 
very nice.
We can still get the raw events too and do user-space post-processing, 
when that is desired - so this does not limit anything that blktrace was 
able to do before - it only extends on it.
Is there any particular blktrace feature you can think of that is not 
present in the blktrace ftrace plugin?
