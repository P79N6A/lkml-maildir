yeah.  I suppse that's true.  What's the meaning of the 'source' object,
generically?

I'm not sure why, yet, it just seems like a bad idea.

So, when I was at Sun (no, I'm not at Sun anymore) there was lots of talk
of driver hardening and fault management.  At the time, the team in
question looked at the various event systems that currently exist in the
kernel or in some patches.  This list might be incomplete, but it's off
the top of my head.
- Netlink
- ACPI (/proc/acpi/event)
- hotplug
- IPMI (not merged maybe?)
- relayfs (not merged)
- evlog (last I saw, this was in big flux)
Now you're proposing netlink as the kevent subsystem.
Wouldn't it be nice if everything could converge?  Ok maybe not
EVERYTHING, but some of these?
These are the things I can see kevents being used for:
- Stateless messages which only matter if someone is listening.  Examples
  of this are "media changed" and stuff like that.
- Fault and error that matter no matter what, and can not afford to be
  dropped.  Examples are things like ECC errors, significant
  driver/subsystem errors, etc.
- System state messages, which really do want someone to be listening, but
  are otherwise discoverable.  Examples of this are "disk full" and
  similar.
So can kevents be used for all of these?  The fact that netlink does not
buffer events if there are no listeners (not saying it should..) makes it
unreliable for fault events.  Can these all be converged?
Sorry for rambling - kernel events has been on my mind for some time.
