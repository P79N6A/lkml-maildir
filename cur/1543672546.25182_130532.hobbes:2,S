I've attached a patch that adds classes for analog and digital cameras 
(webcams, etc...). I plan to submit one such driver in the next few days.
The patch also fixes a typo ("DIGINAL").

Actually it does in some cases. I know of two devices that have analog 
tuners on an smbus-like interface (OV511 USB TV and W9967CF USB TV). The 
tuner can be controlled using a pair of i2c_smbus_write_byte_data() 
calls. This works because, AFAIK, all four-byte tuners can differentiate 
between bytes 0-1 and 2-3 due to their bit patterns.
Would a patch that adds smbus algorithm support to tuner.c be 
acceptable? It will only add about twelve lines, and will still use 
i2c_master_send() when possible.

Add I2C classes for analog and digital cameras, and fix a typo.
