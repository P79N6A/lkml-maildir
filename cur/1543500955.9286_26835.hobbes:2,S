Here we go again!!!!.
It's pretty simple.  Even if they are in violation, the only remedies the
copyright holders can get is an order compelling them to publish the code,
and an injunction not to use any GPL code until they do.  You cannot even
get monetary damages unless you can make a damages case, which is impossible
if you GPL code (it you've given it away, then it's hard to show how you
were damaged by someone's use of it, because YOU GAVE IT TO THEM).  Folks
can argue all they want -- that's it.  What Mike is saying is basically
correct -- pressure from the Open Source Community is the best remedy.
Many of these big companies don't want the black eye of being caught doing
this.  We are having a similar dispute with Novell.  Novell feels like they
can take our NwFs file system for Linux, and do anything they want with it
because we had the misfortune of working for them at some point in the past.
Technically they are correct, except the so called "Border Manager" Novell
has been shipping for the past three years is actually a bastardized hybrid
of the Harvest and Squid Code Bases unde the GPL taken from the public
domain.  I was there when they did it, and watched them do it.  We have told
Novell that until they provide the source code openly for the Border
Manager, they may not posses any of our GPL code (the GPL does state that if
you violate it, then ALL rights under it are REVOKED for ANY GPL CODE IN
YOUR POSSESSION).  If Novell takes our code, we can slap an injunction on
them, and compell them to come into compliance with the GPL.  After
confronting them with this, they immediately backed off, claimed they had
"clean roomed" all the code (even though their Brainshare slides admit the
entire "Border Manager" project was built on Squid/Harvest), they put a
lockout on their website preventing internal Novell folks from accessing our
FTP server.
The fear of discovery for these big companies and the possibility that they
might lose the ability to ship something they pinched from us is usually
enough leverage to get most folks going the right way.
Hope this helps with a real world example.
Jeff
