Note that we aren't talking about problems that ae easy to fix, such 
problems are already fixed. We are talking about drivers that are broken 
for many months.
Besides this, "a whole new wave of people willing to fix things" isn't
necessarily positive - for several of the broken drivers there were
alredy broken "fixes" posted. Some of these drivers need a non-trivial 
fix by someone who knows what he is doing.
