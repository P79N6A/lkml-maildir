Could you elaborate on why that would break mutt?  I am assuming
that the pages being modified are mmap'd, but if they are not, then
it is very clear why mutt (and anything else) would break.

As long as we can keep track of that information and then remember
it for an munmap so that eventually the file times do get updated,
then this should work.
It would seem that a better solution would be to update the file
times whenever the inode gets cleaned, ie. modified pages written
out and the inode synchronized to the disk.  That way, long running
programs would not have to msync occasionally in order to have
the data file properly backed up.
    Thanx...
