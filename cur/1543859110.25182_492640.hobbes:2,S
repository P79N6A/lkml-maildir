Not when one is having booting problems and can't connect their modem.

apm.c is in a Debian package that is too big for me to download before
my next trip to town. So for now I will just put
append="apm=off" as a guess in lilo, as there is no basic mention of
how to turn it off in kernel-parameters.txt, as an attempt to stop the
total power off that happens on my first boot of the day after 10 or
15 minutes.
What I'm saying is that your files should be more self-contained.
	apic=		[APIC,i386] Change the output verbosity whilst booting
			Format: { quiet (default) | verbose | debug }
			Change the amount of debugging information output
			when initialising the APIC and IO-APIC components.
	apm=		[APM] Advanced Power Management
			See header of arch/i386/kernel/apm.c.
Drat. All they had to do was add one little

line with the answers. Instead one needs to have the source code to
find the answer. Multi megabyte download just for one line of
information. And the user might be at a remote site with no net
connection too.
