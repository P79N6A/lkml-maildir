The main issue here is probably where you draw the line between
full functionality and ease of use. Writing the script should be
trivial nowadays (size-detecting mkfs and such really help).

LILO has this: image = /dev/foo range = 1-200
But I'm phasing it out, because it's not nearly as useful as one may
think. (See also lilo/INCOMPAT, search for "range").

See, you really want a file system ;-)

I don't have a problem with bootsect.S. It has its limitations, which
will eventually force it into obsoleteness, but until then, I don't
see why it should be removed.
