Well, looking at your messages, I bet that the appended patch works for 
you, since your irq's are all in the legacy range.
It is also conceptually closer to what the code _used_ to be (it used to
say "if we have an IO-APIC, don't do this", now it says "if this irq is
bound to an IO-APIC, don't do this")
Whether this will matter to Olaf, I don't know, but the old code was 
definitely just writing random bits for the IO-APIC case afaik.
