I was also surprised that mainline was swapping more, it shouldn't
really be the case. Infact in 2.4.13pre3aa1 I'm using shrink_cache to
probe when it's time to start paging, instead of waiting shrink_cache to
fail, this to avoid being too aggressive against the cache. So with
those recent changes it should start swapping earlier and it should swap
more.  But if it's now swapping too much it will be very easy to turn it
down the swap rate as worse with a few liner that removes such
cache-probe early-swap logic.
