Hi,
I found a user of panic_timeout.  The module diskdump:
 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=110436
It uses the panic_timeout to actually implement the timeout after it
completes the dump.
diskdump is a light weight crash dump utility which works great for my
embedded devices that don't have much resources.  I don't know if it is
still maintained (I CC'd the reported author), but I'm hacking it quite a
bit.  The last release (1.0) was based off of 2.6.9.  I'm bringing it up
to 2.6.16 with some major changes.
Not sure if anyone cares about this module, but I felt like I should
report of one user.  But since the diskdump needs to modify the kernel
anyway, it could just remove the deprecated warning or export
panic_timeout itself.  So this isn't really an issue.
Just sending an FYI.
