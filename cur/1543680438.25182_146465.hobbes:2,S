Hello lkml;
One thing thats quit working sometime back in the 2.4.17 or 18 area, 
is the bulldog monitor and its upsd for watching my Belkin Regulator 
Pro 1400 va ups.
As near as I can determine, the daemon is no longer talking to the ups 
via its seriel port.  It got intermittent as the kernel versions 
advanced, often requiring a restart of the upsd daemon after the 
monitoring gui was started, and finally quit altogether at about the 
time frame of kernel 2.4.20.
This is Belkins own linux drivers, which while built in the fall of 
2002, were actually built on a RH5.2 system.  I've not succeeded in 
convincing Belkin they really should update their install, and I have 
yelped at them at least 3 times over this.  I've also requested the 
src's to see if I could fix them but the lawyers won't let that 
happen.  Even if I sign an NDA.
Is there anything that can be done from my end to restore whatever was 
changed in the way these modules talk to each other and to the seriel 
port?
The traceing tools I've run here seem to indicate that the 
daemon is getting data from the ups, but its the "keep the circuit 
alive" data only, no queries from the daemon appear to be getting 
*to* the ups to elicit responses in the form of the data requested.
I am not subscribed as the discussions usually go way over my head.  I 
know just enough C to be dangerous.
