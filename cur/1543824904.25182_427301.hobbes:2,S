Here are the results from Joachim (without the patch):
(from novell.bugzilla.com bug #82986):
segmentation enablee with no extra kernel params = not working
segmentation enabled with pci=noacpi = working
segmentation disabled with no extra kernel params = working
segmentation disabled with pci=noacpi = working
I'd say that only disabling when segmentation is enabled makes sense...,
however the devices should still appear.
I know there are a lot BIOS versions of this machines flying around.
Maybe everybody should check that the latest version is running, first?
I have:
BIOS Information
        Vendor: Hewlett-Packard
        Version: 786B9 v2.05
        Release Date: 01/26/2006
