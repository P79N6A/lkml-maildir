An PCI interrupt that occurs and no device (sharing the INT line) having 
things to do may happen in PCI without being a spurious interrupt (even if
this is probably a rare situation). Your statement let me think that your
knowledge on PCI is just ISA+.

You _must_ call all interrupt handlers that requested the same IRQ when
this IRQ is raised. So your flag does not optimize anything.
