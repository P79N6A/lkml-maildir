Woohoo !
Linus' patch to cs.c and Jeff's 3c575 port _almost_ did the trick !
For the first time *EVER* I was able to transfer an entire linux kernel via FTP
to my notebook.
I still get the spurious IRQ on IRQ7 when running the card at a non-IRQ7 IRQ.
The card stops for a short moment, then resumes.  I also get FIFO errors, but
all in all packets get thru.  netperf reports around 17Mbit/s over half- duplex
100Mbit.
If I run the card at IRQ7 I of course do not get the spurious interrupt messages,
and FTP works, but somehow the netperf gets hosed along the way (just noticed,
the machine actually froze, still sysrq worked)
Anyways, you guys are definitely on the right track, and I'll keep trying to
keep up with the testing    :)      Great job !
(notes: card _still_ doesn't come up on boot. I use:
 2.3.45pre2 with cs.c patch
 PCMCIA 3.1.9
 gcc 2.95.2
 Canon CN600 notebook
 3Com 3CCFE575BT nic)
Pls. let me know if you want any specific info etc.
