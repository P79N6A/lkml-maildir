1: Entry 'sendmail.pid' in /var/run (686849) has deleted/unused inode 688415.  CLEARED.
/1: Entry 'crond.pid' in /var/run (686849) has deleted/unused inode 688416.  CLEARED.
/1: Entry 'xfs.pid' in /var/run (686849) has deleted/unused inode 688417.  CLEARED.
/1: Entry 'atd.pid' in /var/run (686849) has deleted/unused inode 688418.  CLEARED.
