Yes, a common solution for this is to use some SNMP agent that does
64-bit counter accumulation.
IETF expects that some high-speed interfaces will have 64-bit
counters.  From RFC 2233 (Interfaces Group MIB using SMIv2):
<quote>
For interfaces that operate at 20,000,000 (20 million) bits per
second or less, 32-bit byte and packet counters MUST be used.
For interfaces that operate faster than 20,000,000 bits/second,
and slower than 650,000,000 bits/second, 32-bit packet counters
MUST be used and 64-bit octet counters MUST be used. For
interfaces that operate at 650,000,000 bits/second or faster,
64-bit packet counters AND 64-bit octet counters MUST be used.

However, this is a MIB spec.  It does not require a Linux
(/proc) interface to support 64-bit counters.
