I am currently doing a bk pull from linux.bkbits.net/linux-2.6, and can test the above 
patch if dialup via a serial modem breaks again, but I think I already know the answer.
I first noticed this _after_ the last one-line change to drivers/serial/8250.c.
Last night, after establishing that 2.6.11-bk1 was the earliest kernel to have the problem,
and reverting the Xscale patch fixed it, I tried with last night's bk-current.
It also failed as previously described, and worked with the Xscale patch reverted.
Here is a snippet from dmesg from my current kernel (with Xscale reverted) working
on dialup.via serial modem.
[   43.034336] serio: i8042 AUX port at 0x60,0x64 irq 12
[   43.034520] serio: i8042 KBD port at 0x60,0x64 irq 1
[   43.034616] Serial: 8250/16550 driver $Revision: 1.90 $ 8 ports, IRQ sharing disabled

[   43.038329] ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 10) is a 16550A
For completeness, here is the patch I applied with patch -p1 -R:
