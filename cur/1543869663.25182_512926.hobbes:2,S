That's because the kernel address space is identical in every
process's MMU context, so the MMU doesn't have to be touched _at_all_.
 Also, the kernel very rarely touches FPU state, and even when it
does, the FXSAVE/FXRSTOR pair is highly optimized for the "save state
just long enough to move some memory around with XMM instructions"
case.  (I know you know this; this is for the benefit of less
experienced readers.)  If your threadlet model shares the FPU state
and TLS arena among all threadlets running on the same CPU, and
threadlets are scheduled in bursts belonging to the same process (and
preferably the same threadlet entrypoint), then you will get similarly
efficient userspace threadlet-to-threadlet transitions.  If not, not.

That would be the magic of shadow register files.  When the software
does things that hardware expects it to do, everybody wins.  When the
software tries to get clever based on micro-benchmarks, everybody
loses.
