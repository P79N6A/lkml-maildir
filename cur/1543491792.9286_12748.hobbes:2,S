I'm unfamiliar with these errors my nfs server is throwing out when my
solaris machine attempts to mount the nfs exports.
-----------
Apr  2 21:29:49 nfs mountd[3721]: authenticated mount request from
mount.user.com:867
Apr  2 21:29:49 nfs kernel: svc: unknown version (3)
-----------
RedHat running 2.2.5 SMP
Anyone have a idea here?
