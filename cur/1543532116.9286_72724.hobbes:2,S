In common use among filesystem designers, a journalling filesystem
logs meta-data only. The intent is to preserve the integrity of the
filesystem to speed recovery after a crash. Carefully written,
journalling metadata has minimal performance impact. Since the
on-disk data structures are now preserved consistent even across
crashes, more complex data structures can be used, which can, in
most cases, more than make up for the performance hit of the
journal.
You are thinking of the other type, a log-based filesystem, where
metadata and user data are logged. It is much more difficult to
write a log-based filesystem that doesn't suffer from the
performance issues.
Because proper and useful journalling of user data is really
application-specific, it makes more sense for use a meta-data
journalling filesystem, and have the application worry about
journalling the user data (with direct-IO techniques, etc).
(I got most of this from the XFS design documents and references,
which were generated from an analysis of real uses)
