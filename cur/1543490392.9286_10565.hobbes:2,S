Subject: kernel panic cause?
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

What would cause the message:
kernel: Kernel panic: VFS: LRU block list corrupted
to show up on a stock 2.0.36 kernel? I've noticed a number of people
asking about this (on DejaNews) but not a whole lot of answers...any help?
Thanks!
