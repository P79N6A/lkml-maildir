That is expensive. It also requires you create a synchronization point at

Ok if user space has fb mmapped the user is runnign X11 or a graphical
full screen app 99.99999% of the time. So why not simply ignore the problem.
When a user mmaps the fb finish any pending accelerations and stop using
acceleration in the driver until they unmap
