It makes it easier to distinguish between the child receiving a
SIGTRAP and making a system call.  On x86, without TRACESYSGOOD, you
can see if orig_eax == -1 to check for a real SIGTRAP.  I'm not sure
about the other arches, but it's nice to have an arch-independent way
of doing it, even if there are equivalents in every arch.
