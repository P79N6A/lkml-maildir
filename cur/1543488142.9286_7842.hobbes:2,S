Ok, how about this one.
I have /usr/webservers on the nfs server exportable by
3 machines.
I get this error on the nfs server:
fh_verify: logs/suexec_log permission failure, acc=2, error=218103808
fh_verify: logs/suexec_log permission failure, acc=2, error=218103808
fh_verify: logs/suexec_log permission failure, acc=2, error=218103808
fh_verify: logs/suexec_log permission failure, acc=2, error=218103808
fh_verify: logs/suexec_log permission failure, acc=2, error=218103808
constantly.  logs/suexec_log is in
/usr/websevers/https-webx/logs/suexec_log
Why am I getting a permission failure.  This directory isn't
on its own partition.  Also, is there any way to see what machine
is causing the permission failure?
Thanks
