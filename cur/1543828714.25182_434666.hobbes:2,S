Yep.  Some shared with kernel modules, some of device address space.

Intended to be more or less stock fc4 but with CONFIG_PCI_MSI=y and
2.6.17-based patch so the 8131 MSI quirk isn't enabled.
From the config file:
	CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK=y
	CONFIG_DEBUG_SPINLOCK_SLEEP=y

So far we've only got the one test case, but it's quite reliable.
We hit one of the 3 cases (long > 60 seconds) "hangs" at exit,
NMI, or dead system hang, every time we run the test case (well,
perhaps 1 out of 20 times everything is "just fine", probably
something perturbs it enough to let one or more processes get
through the critical section ahead of the whole gang).
