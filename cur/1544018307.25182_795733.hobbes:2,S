In an exclusive cpuset, a task's memory is restricted to a set of mems 
that the administrator has designated.  If it is oom, the kernel must free 
memory on those nodes or the next allocation will again trigger an oom 
(leading to a needlessly killed task that was in a disjoint cpuset).

Then the scope of this new cgroup is restricted to not being used with 
cpusets that could oom.
