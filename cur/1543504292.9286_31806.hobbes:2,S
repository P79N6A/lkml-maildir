   Agreed, one tends to look at the offending thread. But the thread which dumped
   the core need not always be the offender. 
   Ex: If one of the other threads execution path has corrupted the shared data, 
   and when then a different thread happens to access/modify it, this different
   thread dumps core.
   But yes, in general it's true that the offending thread is the one which dumps core.
