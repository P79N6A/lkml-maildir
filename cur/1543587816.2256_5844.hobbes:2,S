Hello Roman,
 Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday afternoon. I was out of town.
 Attached is the output from dmesg and the relavent info from
/var/log/messages. I am using a vanilla 2.4.3 kernel with the
affs support compiled in. (No Modules). I beleive the filesystem is ffs
but not exactly sure. How do I tell?
