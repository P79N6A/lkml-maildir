I was probably responsible for the removal from dabusb.c.  In almost all
cases that I found (over 60 of them), the BKL is not needed in the 
release function.
The use of s->mutex confuses me.  In tiglusb_disconnect(), there is an 
up().  Where is the matching down?  The comment for the mutex just says, 
"locks this struct".  However, it is clear that it doesn't protect the 
whole structure.  There are many places where structure members are 
accessed without the lock being held.
