kbuild has support for the above scenario already - I just forgot.
Say you are hacking ext3.
Do a successfull make and install all modules.
Manually remove the ext3 module from /lib/modules/...
And use the external module support in kbuild like this:
# Got to relevant directory
$> cd fs/ext3
# To build the module:
$> make -C ../.. M=`pwd`
# To install the module:
$> make -C ../.. M=`pwd` modules_install
