Yes. Note that I write only one longword, then force new data onto
the bus by pushing/popping. They I read back. The cache is not going
to be loaded/reloaded from a single longword access. The next access
is a whole page away. You have to worry about 'virtual' read/writes
into the cache only if you are doing sequential access.
