Timeouts are not about AIO or any other event types (there are a lot of
them already as you can see), it is only about syscall itself.
Please point me to _any_ syscall out there which uses absolute time
(except settimeofday() and similar syscalls).

Btw, do you propose to change all users of wait_event()?
Interface is not restricted, it is just different from what you want it
to be, and you did not show why it requires changes.
Btw, there are _no_ interfaces similar to 'wait event with absolute
times' in kernel.

kevent signal registering is atomic with respect to other kevent
syscalls: control syscalls are protected by mutex and waiting syscalls
work with queue, which is protected by appropriate lock.

Let me formulate signal problem here, please point me if it is correct
or not.
User registers some async signal notifications and calls poll() waiting
for some file descriptors to became ready. When it is interrupted there
is no knowledge about what really happend first - signal was delivered
or file descriptor was ready.
Is it correct?
In case it is, let me explain why this situation can not happen with
kevent: since signals are not delivered in the old way, but instead they
are queued into the same queue where file descriptors are, and queueing
is atomic, and pending signal mask is not updated, user will only read
one event after another, which automatically (since delivery is atomic)
means that what first was read, that was first happend.
So, why in the latter situation we need to specify signal mask, which
will block some signals from _async_ delivery, since there is _no_ async
delivery?

Please refer to my above explaination, point me in that example what we
are talking about. It seems we do not understand each other.

If that would be true, I would be very happy. Definitely.

I posted a patch to implement kevent support for posix timers, it is
quite simple in existing model. No need to remove anything, that allows
to have flexibility and create different usage models others than what
is required by fairly small part of the users.

I implemented it to return -enosys for the case, when event type is
smaller than maximum allowed and no subsystem is registered, and -einval 
for the case, when requested type is higher.

It is not about generalization, but about those who do practical work
and those who prefer to spread theoretical thoughts, which result in
several month of unused empty discussions.

Do not say for everyone - it is not a some kind of feodalism with the
only opinion allowed - respect those who do not like/do not want what 
you propose them to use.

I will create completely different model, POSIX completely is not
designed for that - that model allows to specify set of tasks performed
on object completely asycnhronous to user before object is returned -
for example specify destination socket and filename, so async sendfile
will asynchronously open file, transfer it to remote destination and
probably even close (or return file descriptor). The same can be applied
to aio read/write.
