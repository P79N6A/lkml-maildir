Subject: Not able to load megaraid module after kernel upgrade from 2.4.9-e2 to 2.4.9-e25

Hello I am running dell Power Edge 12600, with Firmware 1.68,
I have a Perc 4/Si RAID Controller BIOS version 1.04 FW 2.27 (the last 
version)
I installer Red Hat advanced server 2.4.9-e3 and works fine, the megaraid 
driver is OK, the driver I used is perc-rhas21-1194-a02.tar.gz (the last 
one)
When I upgrade to kernel 2.4.9-e25, using the rpm provided by Red hat, 
happens the same when upgrading to any version, like 2.4.9-e21.
When starting up, the bios can recognize the disk array with no problem, the 
server starts booting OK, but when it gets to load the megaraid module, it 
brakes:
The server is not able to boot any more, here is the error:
----------------
Red Hat nash version 3.2.6 starting
Loading scsi_mod module
SCSI subsystem driver Revision: 1.00
Loading sd_mod module
Loading megaraid module
megaraid: v1.18 (release Date: Wed Dec 4 11:33:00 EST 2002)
megaraid: no BIOS enabled.
/lib/megaraid.o: init_module:
Hint: insmod errors can be caused by incorrect module parameters, including 
invalid IO or IRQ parameters
ERROR: /bin/insmod exited abnormally!
Mounting /proc filesystem

Mouting root filesystem
mount: error 19 mounting ext2
pivotroot: pivot_root(/sysroot,/sysroot/initrd) failed: 2
Freeing unused kernel memory: 244 freed
Kernel panic: No init found. Try passing init= option to kernel
I can clearly see that the driver can't be loaded,there is a problem.
My question is: What is the problem with the driver after upgrading the 
kernel?
I think somehow when red hat is installed with the first kernel, there is 
some aditional configuration with this particular driver that is lost when 
upgrading.
What do I need to reconfigure?
Thanks in advance.
