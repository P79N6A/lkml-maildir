Journal size has more to do with activity when you are in data journaling
mode.  Otherwise you will be hard pressed to fill a 32MB journal with

As long as resize2fs doesn't change the inode of the journal file you should
be fine.

I haven't actually resized any ext2/3 partitions.  Didn't need to.  I'll do
