Why not just take the known-good CPUID signature?
Screw firmware or ACPI tables. They're going to be occasionally wrong.
If we know that "Core 2, version X" has a good local APIC timer, we use 
it. Otherwise we don't.
That's generally how we handle other APIC bugs too (the read-after-write 
thing, for example, or the differences between integrated and off-chip 
APIC's). Sometimes we check the APIC version itself, sometimes we check 
the CPUID information, and sometimes we check both ("modern_apic()").
