Well, no. It doesn't. Because the numbers will change if you add a card
(even at runtime - hotplugging USB SCSI is something real happening
today. And that'd be a very bad thing.
The way it'll be done is that you'll get the device physical path (see
driverfs) to the device, the device serial number and other identifiers
and then a hotplug/system configuration agent will choose a nice name
for it (completely configurable).
