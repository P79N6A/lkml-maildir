   I always was against putting any such device naming tables to the kernel,
but (as you can see from the lots of mail exchanged between me and Linus
and CC'ed to linux-kernel) Linus insisted on them and even refused to make
them a compile-time option.

   Isn't it possible to use the generic PCI code to scan the bus behind
the CardBus bridge and then just fix the differences? It would require
a bit of ifdeffing around in pci.c to avoid __initfunc'ing the bus
scan functions if CardBus support is enabled, but we'll need it for
hot-pluggable PCI anyway. If you want to go this way, I'll gladly
make these modifications.

   Yes, but you can add enumeration of other device types (from PNP
BIOS or ACPI tables) in a simple and straightforward way. I'm not sure
about Linus accepting such a thing, but if it will be tied to a configure
option, it should not be a problem. Also, if done this way, other drivers
will be able to benifit from the detailed resource maps, not only PCMCIA.
				Have a nice fortnight
