Correct, but the quota problem is genuine: what if I want to create a
lot of files in /home/jamie that are readable by other users, but I
want to be able to delete them at some later time and reuse my quota
for something else?
This is quite a normal scenario on multi-user systems with quotas.
You seem to be suggesting that the only method is to have a separate
partition for each user, which is absurd.
Another method is "tree quotas" which have come up on this list
before.  Hopefully they will be included one day; tree quotas seem
like they would solve this problem and some others.

That isn't true.

/tmp is owned by root and anyone can create a hard link in /tmp to
other files, on a system where /tmp doesn't have its own filesystem.

I disagree.  The ability to create files and declare that someone else
can't hard link to them would be useful in a multi-user environment.
