Hi,
I my opinion, basing the vm_swap_full test on the size of swap is bogus.
If you have a 512M box with 128M of swap its a good idea to always release
aggressively.  If the same box has 2G of swap (has /tmp on tmpfs maybe), it
does not make sense to start the agressive release at 1G.  I suggest the 
following makes more sense.

This starts aggressive swaping when the ammount of space left in swap is
less than the size of the inactive pages.
Comments?
