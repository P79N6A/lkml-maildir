My crashes were after my NFS client had copied a few hundred MB as well.
Copying MP3 files, then doing simple commands locked it up....  This
sounds very similar....

My lockup sequence:
  cd some dir on the NFS client
  mkdir testfiles
  cp <some data> testfiles
  ln -s testfiles testfiles-1
  rm testfiles-1
  mv testfiles testfiles-1
  ls testf*
It will usually hang here....  Sounds like a similar problem.  Did you
get any messages on your console prior to lockup?  Also, you might try
the ikd patch and print %eip (on the console).

Sounds about like mine but I have knfsd-1.2.2 (RH 6.0).
