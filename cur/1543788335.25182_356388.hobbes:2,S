The question was raised exactly because cpu_relax() doesn't help on these AMD
CPUs.
Some Pentiums do more than expected from them, and the programs works in a
very fair manner even without cpu_relax(), so the question boils down to
whether there are some new AMD rules how to write such loops, is it a defect
of the CPU, or if we are missing something else.
