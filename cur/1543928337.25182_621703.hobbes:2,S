Let's forget about external modules that are anyway irrelevant for 
upstream kernel development.
Do you have past examples where this would have brought advantages 
for the upstream kernel justifying all the work required for creating 
and maintaining these namespaces?
IOW, where modules were submitted for upstream inclusion and merging 
them was impossible or much harder only because they were developed 
aginst the wrong API?
