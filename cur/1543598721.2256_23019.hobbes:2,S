	I understand that. What I'm afraid of is someone who writes a third-party
protocol module for ip_conntrack (or ip6_conntrack) and tries to call the wrapper
with BR_NETPROTO_LOCK held. LISB, IMHO the primary difficulty is not protecting
the protocol linked-list from packets inside the conntrack; it's protecting the
protocol linked-list from packets in the netfilter stack. FWICT, it should
be almost impossible for packets to move around in conntrack with the rwlock
but not the brlock; but strange things can happen......

	Grrr....I read Rusty's Unreliable Guide to Kernel Locking (twice) and
still didn't remember that. Guess you have to schedule() yourself.
