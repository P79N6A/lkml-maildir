Hi!
I recently posted this to linux-kernel (with a different subject)
I had included a wrong ptch there, i think this one is ok.
As some people before I had the 'Dell trackpoint does not work' problem
after upgrading to 2.5.XX:
That was:
the trackpoint of your dell won't work until:
    - hibernate and wake up the system again
    - plug in an external mouse (you may remove it immediately)
it seems that dells hardware is disabling the trackpoint if you
probed for the touchpad.
A device reset after probing does help, but I've no idea how this
would affect other synaptics touchpad devices although I think
most devices will not complain about one extra reset.
