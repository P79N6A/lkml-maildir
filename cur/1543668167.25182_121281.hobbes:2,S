that's already selected as a module, as it was with my 2.4.18 kernel.
but it's unlikely that's the cause -- all that feature is for is to
support i8kutils, which allows one to do things like read cpu temp
and so on.  that feature is definitely optional, and shouldn't make
any difference, but it's already in there as a module anyway.
