It is just that, FUD.
Here is an article "Linux and Samba kick NT's butt".
http://www.zdnet.com/sr/stories/issue/0,4537,387506,00.html
The article is not about SMP but shows general Linux I/O to be
twice as fast as NT. (we already knew that :)
I sit behind an NT dual P2/400 256MB for too many hours each day.
It is "slow".  One of my (fun) tasks is CD mastering.  When i'm loading
a 500MB wav file into the editor, the machine goes useless for 
two minutes while loading the wave file.  Basically its just reading
the file and writing it to swap.  The CPU is at 5%.  No Alt-Tab between
apps during that time.  No chance of putting the mouse over a button 
(too many dropped ticks).  The NT kernel is just sitting waiting for I/O
completions.
Linux would be embarrassed to be that bad.
I expected M$ to never fix this because its not "broken".
However, i expect billg to start reading the above mentioned literal 
benchmarks and get really really pissed.
Especially since i believe 1999 and 2000 to see Linux *really* start
to cut into M$'s server market share.
+++++++++++
Since i'm on the line, recently i had a machine go over 365 days
uptime.  This caused ruptime to get confused.  I found the source
and fixed it, but i can't find the maintainer to get this really fixed.
