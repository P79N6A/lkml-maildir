"mmap not supported yet" ;)

Sure, that addresses the larger I/O side of things, but it doesn't address
the large filesystem blocksize issues that can only be solved with some kind
of page aggregation abstraction. Compound pages and high order page cache
indexing solves this extremely neatly, regardless of whether the compound
page is contiguous or not.....
