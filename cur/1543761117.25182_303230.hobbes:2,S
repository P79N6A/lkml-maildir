I do, about three times a day ;) And I resolve conflicts between the bk
trees and Linus's tree.  And I resolve conflicts if there's a clash between
one bk tree and another.  And I'll let you know if there's some non-trivial
conflict looming between your tree and someone else's.  And I'll let you
know if there's a compile error or bug in your tree and might even have a
patch for it.
The only real problem with this scheme is that you don't know when I'm
about to release your tree in a -mm kernel.  So I don't support a "this
change is only half done but I'll check it in now" state.  That hasn't
caused any problem yet, as far as I know.
