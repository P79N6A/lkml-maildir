Hello SATA experts,
I need your help with pointers on the Silicon Image SATA controller on the 
Intel D845PEBT2 motherboard. Intel provides only windowz driver for it and 
refuses to do anything with Linux. I would appreciate if you could help me 
with locating a patch for the mainline linux kernel tree of 2.4.19 or 
2.4.20.
I have looked at SATA for SiI release location 
http://www.linux-ide.org
 for 
the same using it against a patched kernel version. But for some reasons I 
have been struggling to use them. Most of the time I get compilation 
problems since the ac patch moves a lot of dependencies *.h files into 
*.h.orig files which causes the build to break.
I would highly appreciate any pointers in helping me overcome this problem.
Thanks in advance,
Rakesh
