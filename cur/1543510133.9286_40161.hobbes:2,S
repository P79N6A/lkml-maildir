It will spin in any case. The first thing in tcp_lhash_wlock() is write_lock.
At least current implementation is good only to allow to sleep under
lock. If you do not sleep, it gives no advantages at all.
You are right in general. /proc/net/tcp and other /proc/net/* are
toys for children. I would not allow to access them on loaded servers.
I remember as old times each access /proc/net/tcp generated overruns
on all serial lines 8)8) Anyone may curse reading /dev/kmem, but it is really
the only working method appropirate for adult men yet 8)8)
