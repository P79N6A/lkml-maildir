Not really. Virtual limits are more gentle than an OOM kill that can occur if
the cgroup runs out of memory. Please also see

Yes, a disk I/O and swap I/O controller are being developed (not by us, but
others in the community). How does one restrict swap space for a particular
application? I can think of RLIMIT_AS for a process and something similar to
what I've posted for cgroups. Not enabling swap is an option, but not very
practical IMHO.
