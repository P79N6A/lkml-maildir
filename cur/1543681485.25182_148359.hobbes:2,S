Like I said, this exact thing can be done using Device-Mapper and EVMS. No 
need to add new partitioning support to the loop driver.
Generally, EVMS does not look for loop devices when scanning for disks to use, 
but I have a simple patch (to the EVMS tools) that will allow it to recognize 
loop devices. Let me know if you're interested.
