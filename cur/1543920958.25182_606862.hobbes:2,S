 No way to avoid it with DEBUG_SHIRQ.

 What do you mean by "proper irq handler with proper hardware"?  Using
softirqs (they used to be called bottom-halves) is actually a natural way 
of handling any interrupt which requires extensive processing.

 I remember having a look into it, but it was long ago and I cannot 
immediately recall the conclusion.  Which means it is either broken or 
deserves a comment as non-obvious.  I will have a look into it again, but 
I am resource-starved a little at the moment, sorry.

 No way to do this safely -- at this point the device probably still has 
its interrupt output asserted and the register to clear it is 
inaccessible, so enabling the line will enter an infinite loop.  At this 
point the system is no longer stable, so it is better to keep at least 
some functionality, so that it may be attempted to be shut down cleanly, 
rather than make it completely irresponsive.  The alternative is panic().

  See #1 above.

 No -- the work already pending will do that.

 The API is documented in: Documentation/networking/phy.txt -- you are 
welcome to improve.  If you do not want to get into the gory details, just 
use the cooked interface and phy_disconnect() will do the dirty work for 
you.

 WARN_ON what?

 CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ.  Barring this option, cancel_work_sync() could have 
been moved to the front of free_irq().  I think I have seen this in 
reality, with the interrupt line left stuck disabled afterwards, but I 
will double check when I have an opportunity.  The approach implemented 
with this patch does work, which is the important bit, and if 
simplification is possible, then it may be applied later.

 Well, if there is another handler registered on this line, you'll get 
your interrupt line stuck disabled.

 I am not sure I know phy.c well enough either, ;-) and your concerns are 
appreciated as interesting conclusions may develop.  If someone disagrees 
with what I have written here, they are welcome to speak out too.
