It's decimal, which was a bug. Cosmetic, but confusing. Fixed.
So in any case, the memory was actually in the 640kB-1M area in this
case.
The actual floating hardware structure may not have been, but I'd really
expect the BIOS to protect it as an ACPI memory area or _something_,
because otherwise no OS is going to know to protect it (including WNT)
