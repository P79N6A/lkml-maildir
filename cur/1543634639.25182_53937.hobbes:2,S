If you toggled VGA 16-color support, that adds or removes the symbols
from fbcon-vga-planes.c to the list of export symbols.
After the toggle, make dep detects that and adapts 
include/linux/modversions.h accordingly.
Now, if you "make" again, all files which include/linux/modversions.h need 
to be rebuilt, since it changed. And that's a lot of files, as you've 
noticed. The problem is that in reality, only a file which also *uses* one 
of these exported symbols really changes. But make cannot know that, so it 
recompiles everything which is possibly affected.
There's no easy way out from that, what you can of course do is turning 
off CONFIG_MODVERSIONS - in that case you'll see that only very little 
will be affected and rebuilt.
The fact that 2.4 recompiles little even in that case is since kbuild 
there has bugs in it which lead to it forgetting to recompile files 
(sometimes eventually resulting in "unresolved symbols in ...", which can
only be cured with make mrproper).
For the current kbuild, you should never need to do make mrproper, it 
should always recognize changes and rebuild what's necessary.

I'm currently still doing small bits, shipped files, asm-offsets 
generation and the like. I'm also preparing for separate build / src tree, 
which makes the current Makefiles and kbuild-2.5's Makefile.in's basically 
equivalent information-wise (though not syntactically).
If switching to kbuild-2.5's preprocessing phase will be necessary or make 
sense I do not even know myself yet. So some more patience is needed 
there.
