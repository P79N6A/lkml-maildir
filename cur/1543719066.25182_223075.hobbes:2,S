For the cases you described, yes.  For some others like nvidia, no.
Not sure if we want to make things worse for some users in order to
improve things for others (better paying ones?).  I want the seperate
interrupt stacks, sure.  I'm just not comfy with 4k per process yet.
But I'll shut up now and see if I can generate better data over the
weekend.  -test11 still had fun stuff like 3k stack consumption over
some code paths in a pretty minimal kernel.  Wonder what 2.6.6 will do
with allyesconfig. ;)
