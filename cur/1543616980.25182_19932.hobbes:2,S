O1+mini-ll feels better and smoother when playing tuxracer during
kernel compilation (both nice +19 and +0 cases). (but I haven't tested
O1+preempt+lockbreak)
However, comparing full_ll versus O(1)+mini_ll when there's no
load, I get 10% higher framerate of XMMS/Jess audio/visual plugin.
When there is some real load, O(1)+mini_ll performs ~30% higher
framerate then just full_ll.
(So the winner for my desktop is still vanilla+full_ll+largenice while
explicitely running non-interactive highload tasks with nice +19 (ie,
compilations, cronjobs, mailserver...) the only "audio skipping" task
is mkisofs)
