What do you mean with this exactly?
Should the user not be able to set these values, or should the driver not 
be able to activate them?
I think it is correct when the driver does not activate them, but I think 
the user should be able to configure them, have them stored inside 
cfg80211/the driver, and have them activated/used when uping the 
interface, or when the rfkill switch has been deactivated. Otherwise it 
will get impossible to boot with rfkill disabled, toggle the switch later 
on and have everything working.
And another side to this:
if a disabled rfkill switch downs the interface (opposed to just 
disabling it but staying "ifconfig up") - what happens to the ip config 
of this interface? What reconfigures the needed routes when a re-enabled 
rfkill switch reactivates the interface? Will manual route add and 
ifconfig statements be impossible and we'll get forced to use some crappy 
distri-scripts and daemons for it?
And third point just coming to my mind:
how is changing the mac address of the card supposed to work? Chaning it 
through ifconfig only works when the interface is downed, so the newly 
wanted mac address has to be saved somewhere before the interface is 
reenabled and reinitialized on the next "ifconfig up".
(And I think it is an absolute requirement that NO packet with the 
old/default mac address may be sent into the air whatsoever)
