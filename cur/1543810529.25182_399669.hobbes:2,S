It is doable - I'm doing it now, but am thinking about reverting part of the 
code to use pbes again. If you're going to look at using bitmaps in place of 
pbes, me changing would be a waste of time. Do you want me to hold off for a 
while? (I'll happily do that, as I have far more than enough to keep me 
occupied at the moment anyway).
