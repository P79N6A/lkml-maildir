Seeing as people seem to be interested ... there are some big holders 
of BKL around too - do_exit shows up badly (50ms in the data Hanna 
posted, and I've seen that a lot before). I've seen sync_old_buffers 
hold the BKL for 64ms on an 8way Specweb99 run (22Gb of RAM?)
(though this was on an older 2.4 kernel, and might be fixed by now).
