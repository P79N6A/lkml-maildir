flushing the dirty pages before locks is probably not required, a dirty
page in the dirty_pages list is no different than a mapped page not in
the dirty_pages list but only with the pte marked dirty, and we cannot flush
the pages with only the pte marked dirty before the locks, but flushing
the dirty_pgaes list won't hurt so overall it looks ok to me.
