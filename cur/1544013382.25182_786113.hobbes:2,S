Thats some crazy stuff!! and just think most of it is
simply magnets.(but more complicated than that)

That sounds nice:
find out what went on in
its absence.

That makes sense:
the more direct the security
path, the more likely it is to be secure, and the less overhead it has,

I guess the most simplest wish would to make sure that tux3
does support SELinux, this way people have more options,
to work with.(Then worry about everything else later);
 One of the main problems I have with osx and winxp
is the missing of such options(I feel naked without SELinux);
