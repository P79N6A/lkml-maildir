Um...  In 4.2 - more or less so.  In 4.4 - way more than that:
	* ffs_bmap() is not doing any allocations now
	* ffs_balloc() does (and is an analog of old bmap()) and it contains
a *lot* more code than bmap() had - handling of fragments, stuff forced
by new VM _and_ seriously different overall structure of code.
	WTF?  4BSD code is out there, in SCCS, no less.  Goes back
to 1982 or so.  It's not that checking it would be a problem - grab
the 4th CD from Kirk's 4-parter (CSRG archives) and see yourself.
	BTW, having _that_ converted to BK might be an interesting thing.
To do that one would need to take file moves into account, but they'd
got enough snapshots of the tree to reconstruct that...
