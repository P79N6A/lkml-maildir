On a related note, I have noticed tcpdump shows only outgoing packets on
my box when tcpdumping eth0.
Also, is there a place where one can download a newer version of the
netfilter userspace utilities?  The copy available at the URLs listed in
the Changes file still require the global change from "struct device" to
"struct net_device" and other adjustments to even compile...
