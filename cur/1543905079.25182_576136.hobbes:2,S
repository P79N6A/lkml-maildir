Can anyone explain precisely what Volanomark is doing? If it's something
dumb like "looping on sched_yield until the 'right' thread runs and finishes
what we're waiting for" then I think any regression can be ignored.
This applies if and only if CFS' sched_yield behavior is sane and Volano's
is insane.
A sane sched_yield implementation must do two things:
1) Reward processes that actually do yield most of their CPU time to another
process.
2) Make an effort to run every ready-to-run process at the same or higher
static priority level before re-scheduling this process. (That won't always
be possible due to SMP issues, but a reasonable effort is needed.)
If CFS is doing these two things, and Volanomark is looping on sched_yield
until the 'right thread' runs, then CFS is doing the right and Volanomark
isn't. Volanomark deserves to lose.
If CFS binds processes to processors more tightly and thus sched_yield can't
yield to a process that was planned to run on another CPU in the future,
that would be a legitimate complaint about CFS.
