Subject: Hard lock on boot with both 2.2.16 and 2.4.0-pre7

I'm not quite certain if this is a user-mode, kernel, or hardware problem,
but there is a reproducible hard lock involved (SysRq keys no longer work,
etc.) and I managed to get some Oops output, so maybe someone here can
give me a clue what's going on.  As it is, I have no idea what to do next,
and my box is unusable.
Hardware: dual PIII 500, not overclocked, Intel motherboard, IDE, 3com
 ethernet card, ask if you need any more details...
Kernel: originally 2.2.16, then 2.4.0-pre7
Distro: Debian woody
A few days ago, I ran a standard apt-get upgrade, which seemed to complete
without problems.  A few minutes later, the machine locked completely.
After SysRq failed to have effect, rebooted the machine manually, and while
starting daemons it froze solid again, repeatedly printing to the screen:
"stuck on TLB IPI wait (CPU#1)"
(it varies whether it says CPU#1 or CPU#0).
It seems that the relevant daemon was mysql; after disabling mysql, it
waited until getting to postgres to show the same behaviour; after disabling
postgres, it seems to get to sshd before crashing.  I can start the box in
single user mode and things seem to mostly work fine (I'm typing this email
on the box now, the ethernet is up, and I had no problems compiling a new
kernel version for testing).  Booting kernel 2.4.0-pre7 instead, I saw the
same behaviour, but a more detailed error message (may be a typo or two;
I had to copy it out by hand):

ksymoops doesn't seem to mind the lack of module information):

I would appreciate any information at all people can give me about this
problem; as I said, I can't even tell for sure whether it's hardware, kernel,
or userland.  The consistency over kernel versions and completeness of the
lock suggest something hardware related, but it seems to have happened
immediately following an upgrade (though I'm not sure; mysql and postgres
were both upgraded, but ssh was not, so it's unclear why it would suddenly
start crashing the box), and is highly sensitive to the program being run.
Thank you in advance for any information you can give.
