Hmm, good catch.

That could be an avenue to explore. I guess we probably want to optimize the
actual lookup and memory usage before looking at that.

Yes 1MB is much too big. We're looking right now at 3 lock resources per
inode, so total number of elements depends upon your file system I suppose.
Hopefully I'll have some time today to run some basic tests which may show
us what size strikes a better balance of performance versus memory overhead.
