Yes. As this is just the initialization code, I think adding second write 
is OK. But, I am not sure why two writes are required and will the two write
be sufficient for all systems. I don't seem to remember anything about this
in HPET specs. I will double check it. 
Basically I am thinking of something like this will be a good generic solution
in place of simple two writes.
for (i = 0 ; i <some number for max retries>; i++) {
	hpet_writel(hpet_tick, HPET_T0_CMP);
	if (hpet_tick == hpet_readl(hpet_tick, HPET_T0_CMP))
		break;
}
I think we can wait for result from Andrew's system and chose either one
of the above approaches.
Thanks,
