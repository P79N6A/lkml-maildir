I agree. It is clearly going to be a drag on performance, but it should
be very much a corner case, so...
To tell you the truth, I'm more interested in this case in order to
figure out how to make mmap() work correctly for the case of an ordinary
file, but where the file changes on the server. Currently we just call
invalidate_inode_pages2(), without unmapping first. The conclusion from
Kenny's testcase appears to be that this may lead to mmapped dirty data
being lost.
Cheers,
