Perhaps we shouldn't rely on stderr, and instead have a backchannel as part of the 
protocol itself.  After all, the protocol already does packetization, so all it needs is a 
reliable way to pick out the error/status packets; we could even combine that with a 
machine-readable code (like SMTP et al) that could get interpreted by the other side as 
needed.
