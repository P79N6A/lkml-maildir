That's because I hit "reply" first time and have not looked at the CC list.

Actually, I have altenate patch (but no, I have not tried to attach it) ;)
I have full iget5_locked backport (that I was sending around some time ago). Only it
will break every iget4 user not in the tree (by changing VFS API), so I guess it is not an option.
But if people think it is good idea to adapt this change, I can easily resurrect that patch, of course.
Bye,
