Hmm. I do not know. I did not tried that, I just created 120000 empty files,
and I am sure it did not finished copy even 10k of them.

In single user mode with swap:
2058 6 1 0 0 0 0
(in previous entries 1st number constantly increases.
the 3rd number always 0 except the last entry)
Shift - Scroll lock shows 11854 kb of free pages.
Normal boot:
2057 7 1 0 0 0 0
(in previous entries 1st number constantly increases.
the 3rd number always 0 except the last 4 entries)
Shift - Scroll lock shows 1444kb.
Bye,
