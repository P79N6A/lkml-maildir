On my old 486 with 4 IDE drives in PIO mode, I just copied some files from
hdb5 to hdd5 and then tried to gunzip another file on hdb5. The kernel spit
out this:
hdc: status timeout: status=0xd0 { Busy }
hdc: no DRQ after issuing WRITE
ide1: unexpected interrupt, status=0xd0, count=1
ide1: reset: success
The root partition is on hdc1 so this seems to have occurred when the system
tried to load gunzip. I don't understand why WRITE should be mentioned here.
