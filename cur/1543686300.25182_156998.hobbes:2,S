I've been watching Con and Ingo's efforts with the process
scheduler and i haven't seen people complaining that the
process scheduler is worse.  They have complained that
interactive processes seem to have more latency.  Con has
rightly questioned whether that might be because the process
scheduler has less control over CPU time allocation than in
2.4.  Remember that the process scheduler only manages the
CPU time not spent in I/O and other overhead.
If there is something in BIO chewing cycles it will wreak
havoc with latency no matter what you do about process
scheduling.  The work on BIO to improve bandwidth and reduce
latency was Herculean but the growing performance gap
between CPU and I/O is a formidable challenge.
