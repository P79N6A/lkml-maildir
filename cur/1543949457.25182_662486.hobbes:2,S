Wouldn't it be easier if your virtualization software just marked
that area reserved or unmapped in its e820 map? 
Of if you don't want that you can get the same result with mem=... 
arguments (e.g commonly used by crash dumping) 
Even if that was all not possible for some reason having CONFIG for this would
seem unfortunate for me -- i don't think users really want specially
compiled kernels for specific hypervisors. With paravirt Linux
is trying to get away from that. Some runtime setup method
would be much better.
