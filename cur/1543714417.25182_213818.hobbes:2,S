Wow, clearly something is going wrong with interrupt delivery. You only
received 9 timer interrupts in 10 seconds!

Yea, those values are both junk as the X/sec ratio is totally skewed.

Note the "Using tsc for high-res timesource" in your dmesg. 
I'm working now to reproduce this w/ a 2G system here in our lab, and
just for completeness, could you also send me your BIOS revision number?
thanks
