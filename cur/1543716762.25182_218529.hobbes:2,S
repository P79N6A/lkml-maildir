I agree with that, but that combination had a heck of a lot of soak time
on it. This stack crunching exercise is happening fairly early on in a
stable kernel series, that makes me nervous. A lot of new code showed up
in the meantime during 2.5 development which changed many of these
code paths.
You can do static code analysis and say which functions are stack hogs and
rework them, but the dynamic analysis is really hard to do for all possibly
combinations. Doing the dynamic analysis on someones production fileserver may
not be the wisest move ever made.
