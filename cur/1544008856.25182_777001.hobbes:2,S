Agreed.  (When so much is much is undocumented anyway, there is no way
that lack of documentation can be used to signal "this is not an ABI.)

Agreed.

Agreed.

While clearly documentation is not the final answer, I think you
undervalue it somewhat, and I think it's worth mentioning two specific
points.  Documentation may be secondary to code, but it can help a
lot, especially if:
* The documentation is done at the same time as the code (by the
developer, or by someone working with the developer).  This typically
makes the developer think more about the code they are writing.  It
also gives others to more quickly understand the code with the aim of
reviewing the code and/or API design, and perhaps testing it.  There
simply isn't enough review and testing going on, and documentation can
make a real difference there, IMO.
*  While the "but you should never have relied on it, because the docs
say X" argument may not hold, there is one important way that I think
documentation can still help: explicitly saying that "the behavior is
unspecified around point X, and other code should not rely on a
specific behavior".  This legitimately allows developers to change the
behavior around point X in the future.  (I made the point at LPC, if
you force users to read the code behind an API, then you end up
creating a "tight spec", since they will do exactly what the code
permits.  In this sense, documentation can be used to "loosen" the
spec.)
Cheers,
Michael
