I totally agree on this. A binary driver could better than nothing at this
point. Another thing that wonders me, is why companies like Broadcom, if they
are so open to releasing the drivers at some point, where they can make the
regulation agencies somewhat happy, are so ignorant then. I've heard of serveral
people, that tried to get a statement on the possibilty for Linux drivers from
then and the return is nothing. I've actually tried myself. No response at all.
