Yes, we can make it work that way (see downthread).  Yes, combined with
lazy allocation (and pipefs-like scheme) it can turn into nice, _working_
code.
But right now we have
	a) broken patch applied to the tree
	b) somewhat tested patch that may (after being modified so that it
would _apply_ to -pre11) fix the breakage.  Once it's tested enough to
be consider as a candidate for inclusion, that is.
IMNSHO it's somewhat less than ideal situation.  I've already talked to
with Andrea and once he gets back to life (no, 'e's just sleepin') we'll
try to do something usable.  Life would be much simpler if aforementioned
cunning plan included sending mail to participants (me and Andrea) before
putting the patch into the tree, though.  Oh, well...

It can be modified so that combination with lazy-bdev and pipefs-like tree
would work.  And yes, most of the ugliness would just go away.
The problem being, I'd rather do it in a different order -
	1) finish testing of lazy-bdev
	2) apply well-tested patch
	3) test modified bedv-in-pagecache patch
	4) apply it, once it got public testing.
As it is, we'll do combined patch, diff it against -pre11 and submit
for inclusion - new hole in the main tree needs fixing...
