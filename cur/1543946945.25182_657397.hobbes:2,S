This is more convincing, was the code ever in git? How did you measure the
overhead? What are your plans for reports with regressions where
kernel.compat_sched_yield is set to 1?
I have an alternate approach in mind (that I need to find time for),
threaded-rbtrees. Walking the tree is really efficient, specially finding
successor of a node.
