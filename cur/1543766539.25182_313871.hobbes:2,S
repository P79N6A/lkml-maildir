I am sorrry, that is complete bull*. sysfs also allows removing
modules at an arbitrary time (and usually without annoying "waiting
for refcount" at that)... You just seem to not understand how driver
code works, thus the need of inventing your own schema.
BTW, I am looking at the connector code ATM and I am just amazed at
all wied refounting stuff that is going on there. what a single
actomic_dec_and_test() call without checkng reurn vaue is supposed to
do again?
