REDIRECT is a for of DNAT, like you correctly state. DNAT _needs_
ip_conntrack, so that's not what is causing problems.
Causing problems is probably the nf_reset() and other hacks that were
put into the briding code to remove conntrack references once a packet
enters the bridge (in order to make the 'fake iptables hooks' from
the bridging code work).  
There were recently a number of fixes for this issue, which each caused
new bugs.  
Could you please try with a current development kernel (linus' git tree,
or davem's net-2.6.14 tree) and see if the problem persists?
