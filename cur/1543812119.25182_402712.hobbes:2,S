I assume this is you applying these patches to your -mm tree (which contains
some of Trond's patches), rather than Linus's tree or Trond's tree.
Can you be more specific about which patches you've got problems with? Is it
mainly that patch 5/5 and little bits of patch 2/5 don't apply?
There's a problem here in that your tree is incompatible with Linus's tree in
various ways. I believe you've said before that you prefer the patches you're
given to have been made against Linus's tree... is that right?
Also, do you yet have a git tree holding your patchset? If not, have you
considered using stacked git (StGIT) to provide one?
