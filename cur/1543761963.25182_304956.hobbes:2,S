seems to be a true SMP race: when i boot with 1 CPU it doesnt trigger,
the same kernel image and 2 CPUs triggers it on CPU#1. (CPU#0 is the
boot CPU) Note that the timing of the crash is not deterministic
(sometimes i get it during net startup, sometimes during ACPI startup),
but it always crashes within rcu_advance_callbacks().
one difference between your tests and mine is that your kernel is doing
_synchronize_kernel() from preempt-off sections (correct?), while my
kernel with PREEMPT_RT does it on preemptable sections.
