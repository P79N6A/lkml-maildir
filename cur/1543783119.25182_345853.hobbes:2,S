It should be fixed by the patch here:

Tony,
	I don't see any slow bootups on x86 because of dyn-tick.
If you still see them in your env, can you test with the patch above?
Recovering time after sleep is the single biggest problem that I seem
to have, even while using ACPI PM timer (forget TSC). Time can
drift by couple of seconds after few hours. I have made
some changes to the lost tick calculation in timer_pm.c after which
it seems to be stable on some machines, but I cant repeat that
on other (maybe newer) machines. Will post out all the changes I have
pretty soon.
