Does the box survive io intensive workloads? Have you tried using net or
serial console to see if it spits out any info before it crashes? I
would not be too surprised if it's the aic7xxx driver taking a dive, I'd
be a lot more surprised if it's actually the bouncing (I don't think you
do any, can you post cat /proc/meminfo | grep -i bounce on that box?) or
a generic vm/block bug causing you problems.
