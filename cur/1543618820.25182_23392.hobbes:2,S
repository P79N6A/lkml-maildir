This bug has been around since 2.4.6pre days and it is still unfixed in
mainline kernels. I have posted patch fix this bug twice, once in 2.4.6pre
days and once in 2.4.17pre days. My patches were ignored as usual.
Just for the record, this bug has been fixed in loop-AES since version v1.3b
(June 27 2001). Latest version is here:
