I couldn't get it to compile. What am I suppose to do? I ran autogen.sh 
in the top level dir and it gave the error message:
./configure: line 20486: syntax error near unexpected token `XINERMA,'
./configure: line 20486: `XORG_DRIVER_CHECK_EXT(XINERMA, xineramaproto)'
Then I also tried to run make and make -f Makefile.in (in the reg_dumper 
dir and top level dir), and it said:
Makefile.in:15 *** missing separator. Stop.
That part of Makefile.in contains:
@SET_MAKE@
VPATH = @srcdir@
What am I doing wrong? You'll have to forgive me, I'm not that 
experienced with the cmd line and compiling - I'm trying though.

How exactly would I do that? I would think I could just add command at 
the end of 3 files in /etc/init.d. Would that work? It should run my 
command when it starts that script and gets to the end. Or do boot 
scripts exit in the middle of the script, which would prevent my command 
from running?

I'm not sure. I just have a home wireless router (Hawking HWR54G). I 
have no idea what the Uni. router is.
On both, I connect to an unencrypted network, but at the Uni. it 
redirects to a login page where I have to log on before I can actually 
use the Internet. Is there anyway I could get more information about the 
Uni. router?
