I'm pretty calm, thank you.

Unfortunately AlSA _does not_ provide hardware abstraction. Instead,
it relies on libalsa in userland to do the kernel work. That means
that testing sound is ugly.
Plus, it made some "interesting choices" with naming, basically
inventing parallel system to /dev/. (Why do I have to specify "card 0"
number in xmms, and WTF it means? Why can't alsa use device paths as
rest of sane world?)
So... in dsp, if I wanted to record sound, I did
	cat /dev/dsp > /tmp/foo; cat /tmp/foo > /dev/dsp
If that worked, I had usable sound system, and if it broke, I knew it
is kernel fault. 
With alsa it is
	download & install alsalib
	download & install alsautils
	create 1007 nodes in /dev
	launch alsamixer, figure out what to do from inadequate descriptions
	launch arecord, try to guess some suitable options
	launch aplay, try to guess some options
...if it does not work, it may be a kernel problem or userspace
problem; I'm left with debugging both. That makes alsa pretty much
untestable.
(For _my_ usage, something like "alsatest" that is self-contained,
preferably statically linked, and just tests microphone and sound
output would be nice. But that does not fix the fact that alsa is
broken by design).
