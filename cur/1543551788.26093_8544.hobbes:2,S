Im running my linux box as a RAS using pppd 2.3.7 on kernel version 2.2.5.
What we see is that if we disconnect more than 60 sessions in an instant
only 60 or so pppd go away and not the rest.. Secondly what we have seen is
that after there have been about  more than 20000 connections /
disconnections  SIGHUP on a few cases does not reach the pppd process and
though ive closed the master handle on my gateway the pppd (the slave) still
hangs around
HAs any one come accross this problem..
