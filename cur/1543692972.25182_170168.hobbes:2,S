Granted.  The major point is that it requires a development cycle
before it is ready.  Only if this is to be maintained as part of
the kernel is it needed to be 2.7 work.

My point is that we need to cleanly handle the fact that glibc
defines it's own abi that is not equivalent to the kernel abi.
A linux specific namespace does that.  After libc is done with
the definitions users will still use MS_RDONLY.
Using defines unconditionally in a private namespace is cumbersome.
A better way to go is probably:
linuxabi/features.h
....
#ifdef __USE_LINUX_NS
# define LINUX_NS(X) LINUX_##
#else
# define LINUX_NS(X) X
#endif
.....
linuxabi/mountflags.h
#include <linuxabi/features.h>
enum {
        LINUX_NS(MS_RDONLY) = 1,
	LINUX_NS(MS_NOSUID) = 2,
};
The result being that defines are placed in their own namespace
if necessary to avoid libc/kernel abi differences.
