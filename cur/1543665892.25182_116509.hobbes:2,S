Real time is still useful, if only as a hint to users. E.g.
assume that you have dependencies the SCM doesn't know about.
Example: somebody posts on linux-kernel a one-line fix for a
remote root exploit. You'll instantly get dozens of people who
will apply that one to their local views, without waiting or
making a common unique change set.
Some of those view may have branched from a long time ago, and
not have touched any common change set for months. So the
partial order of applied change sets tells you very little.
Naturally, such one-line fixes will be slightly different, and
eventually, some of them will merge ...
