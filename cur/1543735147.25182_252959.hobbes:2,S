Hi Andrew.
Here are two patches which I currently have included in Suspend2, which
fix issues with device drivers. These patches weren't written by me, but
have been submitted by users and have been in suspend and tested for at
least a few weeks. (Author in brackets).
1/2: NE2K suspend/resume support. (Arkadiusz Miskiewicz)
2/2: Suspend/resume for ali5451 driver (Bernard Blackham).
Regards,
Nigel

Many today claim to be tolerant. True tolerance, however, can cope with others
being intolerant.
