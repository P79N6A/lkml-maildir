Probably folding... possibly from vim/gvim.
If you're curious, look at: 
http://vim.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/fold.html
:set foldmethod=marker
:set foldmarker={,}
:set foldcolumn=6
Gets folding "mostly right" for C/C++ code.  Manually added folds add in 
a C comment containing the foldmarker, in this case "/* { */"
and "/* } */"
emacs probably has this feature as well, but I'm a vim person myself. :)
If you are not familiar with folding, look into it.  I find it very 
useful when dealing with unfamiliar code or looking at program structure.
HTH,
Eli
