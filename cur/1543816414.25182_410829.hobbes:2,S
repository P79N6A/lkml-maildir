  Thank you for your help. But my problem is that I can only access 80
and 443 ports behind the company firewall :(. So I guess that doesn't
work for me.
  For now I'll put the patch both in the mail text and as the
attachment, so maintainers can use the attached right-formatted patch
and other can also reply my patch in the text. Andrew, is it
acceptable?
  Any google guy here? Please, add this feature in gmail...
