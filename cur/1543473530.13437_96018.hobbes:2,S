Hi!
I had the same problem and have found a fix:
The driver does not mask out the lower bits of the hardware
adress obtained from the PCI configuration registers.
Something like 
 addr &= PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_MASK; 
around line 2937 does the trick for me.
Something similiar has to be done for the ifdef'ed SPARC part
Jo
