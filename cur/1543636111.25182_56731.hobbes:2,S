hi,
I'm trying to get -ac to compile on sparc32 again.
At some point in time,
	long counter;
	long nice;
both disappeared from task_struct (def. in include/linux/sched.h).
However, arch/sparc/kernel/process.c::cpu_idle() tries to set
these properties for the idle task:
	current->nice = 20;
	current->counter = -100;
	init_idle();   
... which can't be done, of course.
The question is, how do I cope with this properly?
Have functions been introduced to adjust the appropriate
values in an instance of task_t when renicing? Or?
Thanks,
T.
