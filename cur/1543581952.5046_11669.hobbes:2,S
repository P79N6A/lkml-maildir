This trace seems to make sense, except that nfssvc_encode_diropres
doesn't seem to make any subroutine calls at offset 100 as seems to be
implied. 
Could you run
 echo disassemble nfssvc_encode_diropres | gdb -batch -x /dev/stdin vmlinux
giving it the vmlinux that was running when this oops was produced? and
also tell me exactly what patches you have ontop of 2.4.1 and where to
find them.
