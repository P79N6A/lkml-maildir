Subject: booting kernel locks at partition check

I am trying to install a newer kernel (2.2.0pre7).  It compiles fine but
when booting it finishes the partition check, but halts immediately after.
No error messages.  It seems to do this for any kernel I try to compile.
I am running RH 5.2 on a PII with 64 megs of RAM.  2.0.36 boots fine.  Any
ideas?
Thanks
