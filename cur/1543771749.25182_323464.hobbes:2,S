Hm, the entry should be there if you have set up the device structures
properly.
But that's not the main problem here...

Ok, in re-reading the firmware code, you are correct, it will still
timeout in 10 seconds and call your callback.  
Which, in my opinion, is wrong.  We should have some way to say "wait
forever".  Care to change the firmware_class.c code to support this?
I was assuming that this would wait forever, and is why I pointed you in
this direction.  Sorry about the confusion here.

You need to register your device with the driver core, right?
And why not just point to the cpu device instead?  Or some other
platform device...

You can ignore hald messages, they do not come from the kernel :)
