Yes, GFDL has nothing to do with the main issue. No, it is not 
necessarily illegal to redistribute binary images of the kernel as they 
are today (see below). The first problem is that they (the complete 
w/firmware kernel binary images) are not DFSG-free, anyway. The second 
problem is that some firmware blobs don't have explicitly stated in the 
kernel tree which exactly are their licensing terms for redistribution 
-- those are, in principle, undistributable.

If putting the firmwares outside the kernel makes *them* distributable, 
then the binary kernel image is already distributable -- just not 
DFSG-free. The important fact WRT Debian, IMHO, is that putting the 
firmwares outside the kernel makes the kernel binary image DFSG-free.
HTH,
