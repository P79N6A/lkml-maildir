Your patch fixes the above problem, thanks.
Unfortunately, the first bug I encountered (which lead me to 
stress-test hfsplus support in the first place) is still present.
I still wasn't able to reproduce it on another partition than my Mac OS 
X root partition. :-(
The symptoms are as follows: Whenever I try to write a sufficently 
large file (always larger than 512k), or try to read a sufficiently 
large file (say a 4 MB file) with any program, I get:
   HFS+-fs: request for non-existent node 1929183232 in B*Tree
after which the I/O operation fails like this:
   dd: writing 'bla': Cannot allocate memory
The number of the non-existent node will not change until I do a fsck.
After linux handled the partition, Apple's fsck_hfs will always report 
errors, which it usually can't fix, but TechTool Deluxe can.
In the past, hpfsck (from ftp.penguinppc.org/users/hasi/) would report 
lots of cases of:
   Backpointers in Node 239 index 70 out of order (0x1001e982 >= 
0x1002298e)
with differing indices but constant node number (until the next fsck).
However, lately, all I get is:
   [...]
   *** Checking Backup Volume Header:
   Unexpected Volume signature '  ' expected 'H+'
   hpfsck: hpfsck: This is not a HFS+ volume (Unknown error 4294967295)
However, I think I have narrowed it down somewhat: If I apply:

                 keylen = hfs_brec_keylen(bnode, e);
then, this new printk happens often. More importantly, it happens 
ALWAYS before the "request for non-existent node" message and 
subsequent failure.
I guess that sometimes, the bnodes aren't ordered correctly, and 
therefore we don't find the correct one. If the while loop is 
terminated without "goto done;", shouldn't we fall back to checking all 
bnodes for a matching key, in case the inodes aren't ordered correctly? 
I've tried to implement exactly that, but this resulted in lots of 
Oopses - I guess I'd have to dig deeper, guess less, and understand 
more to find out more. Unfortunately, I can't debug the problem while 
it's happening, because my ibook doesn't have a serial port...
How could I get to the root of the problem?
Thanks,
Martin
