Subject: [PATCH][PPC64] Kconfig bits for CONFIG_SPINLINE
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2004/5/13/67

When I sent the patch to uninline the spinlocks, I inadvertently left
out the change to arch/ppc64/Kconfig which defines the config symbol
for inlining the locks (CONFIG_SPINLINE now).  This patch adds it.  It
also adds a symbol CONFIG_PPC_SPLPAR which enables the code for
calling the hypervisor on shared-processor logically-partitioned
system to yield the physical processor to the lock holder when
spinning.  (The code that depends on this symbol is already present in
arch/ppc64/lib/locks.c.)
Please apply.
Thanks,
Paul.
