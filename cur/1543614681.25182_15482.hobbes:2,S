*nod*, until they get scooped up into another tree -ac, -dj, -whatever
and fed to you whenever you're in the mood for resyncing.

Absolutely. When I decided to take on carrying the 2.4 patches in sync
with 2.5, I knew I was undertaking something of no small order.
Scooping up forward port patches, and silent-drop bits from l-k
is almost a full time job in itself when yourself and Marcelo release
kernels in quick succession 8-)
And when you're ready to resync what I've got so far (currently ~3mb),
it's going to be another full time job splitting it into bits to feed
you linus-bite-sized chunks. (ObSidenote: When this time comes btw,
if maintainers of relevant parts want to feed Linus their relevant
parts from my tree, that would be appreciated, and would keep _my_ load
down :-)
