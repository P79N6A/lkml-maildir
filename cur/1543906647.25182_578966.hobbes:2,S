Ah, I think I understand now. Yes this is indeed a good idea!
It would be quite doable to implement this on top of that I already
have. We would need to extend the socket with a sock_opt that would
reserve a specified amount of data for that specific socket. And then on
socket demux check if the socket has a non zero reserve and has not yet
exceeded said reserve. If so, process the packet.
This would also quite neatly work for -rt where we would not want
incomming packet processing to be delayed by memory allocations.
