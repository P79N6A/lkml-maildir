Hi Jakub,
Look at it this way:
    Amount of kernel effort available: zero
	Ability to invoke debugger with kmod-like trap: none
	Ability to invoke debugger with ptrace technology: limited
	Michael's ucore could replace kernel core dumping: no
    Amount of kernel effort available: minimal
	Ability to invoke debugger with kmod-like trap: questionable
	Ability to invoke debugger with ptrace technology: yes
	Michael's ucore could replace kernel core dumping: maybe
    Amount of kernel effort available: extensive
	Ability to invoke debugger with kmod-like trap: yes
	Ability to invoke debugger with ptrace technology: yes
	Michael's ucore could replace kernel core dumping: maybe
For any given level of kernel effort, using ptrace technology gives
a more powerful result than a kmod-like trap.  That's my point.
