It's interesting ;)
In fact some distributions do have a read-ahead script to preload files on
startup. The readahead system call should be enough for this purpose:
NAME
       readahead - perform file readahead into page cache
SYNOPSIS
       #include <fcntl.h>
       ssize_t readahead(int fd, off64_t *offset, size_t count);
Thanks,
Wu
