Currently this is what it actually does.
But functionally, high nice value (to me at least)
means this process is low priority on the system =>
other processes get more system resources, and
the fact that this doesn't apply to IO until
now is just a defect. Now I can see some advantage
to splitting the tunables but not requiring
a new interface to turn this functionalit on.
I would like the new interface to turn it off.
I.E. I would like:
nice
     cpu
     IO
whereas you would like:
really_nice
     nice
     ionice

fair enough.
