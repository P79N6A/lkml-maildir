This came up at the kbuild birds-of-a-feather meeting at Linux
World Expo last week.
Here's my thought for 2.5: all, and I mean *all*, generated files
should match a small *documented* set of patterns.  Something on
the order of:
    -X '*.[osi]' -X 'Generated/'
This would enable "make clean" to be small and simple.  More importantly,
it would allow people to create "dontdiff" files, .cvsignore files,
and any other source management files that they want.
By the way, we have a list for this stuff: linux-kbuild@torque.net.
Talk to majordomo@torque.net if you want to chat about linux kernel
building issues.
