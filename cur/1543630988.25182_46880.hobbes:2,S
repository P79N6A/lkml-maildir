You misunderstand.
Everybody agrees that /proc/partitions is the wrong place.
Up to now these statistics have not been part of any official
kernel, stable or not.
However, someone wanted to introduce them for the first time
in 2.4.19 and put them in /proc/partitions. That is a really bad idea,
especially when they will be somewhere else in 2.5.
