I consider myself the most precious user of max_loop.
The max_loop parameter would cause a fatal error only in the case if you 
modprobe loop manually, for example:
  $ modprobe loop max_loop=200
But people don't usually use this, read below.

yes, but no as a module parameter.
People usually use max_loop as a 'kernel boot parameter' passed in 
APPEND section in a boot loader (such as LILO for example), not as a 
parameter for module in initrd. Why? Because it's easier; people are 
lazy, people compile loop.c into kernel so they don't need to update the 
loop.ko module in initrd every time a new Kernel is released.
I believe that IF you _really_ need to preserve the boot parameter, then 
the parameter should _not_ be ignored, rather it should have the same 
function like before - to limit the loop driver so if you use 
max_loop=10 for example, it should not allow loop.c to create more than 
10 loops.
And if no parameter is used at all, there will be unlimited amount of 
loops. Simply clever :)
This will make it _completely_ backward-compatible, with very small code 
change I guess.
Just my two cents.
Thank you for reading so far.
