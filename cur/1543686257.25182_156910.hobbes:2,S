Your message would be easier to reply to and read if it was wrapped at 72 
characters, please look into fixing that for the sake of your recipients. 
Thanks.

For the legacy devices, an irq_vector mapping should be sufficient as you 
currently maintain. You could also possibly have a seperate do_MSI which 
gets a vector pushed to it and then uses mesc_desc instead to do the 
handlers. You then install the IDT entry using the seperate MSI interrupt 
stub; set_intr_gate(vector, msi_interrupt[msi_num]) where msi_interrupt is 
a NR_MSI sized array. This way you can avoid touching do_IRQ entirely.

Yes but there is other code which modifies msi_desc members. i think a per 
msi_desc lock is needed. You could also use a kmem_cache to allocate them, 
and perhaps utilise HWCACHE_ALIGN.
