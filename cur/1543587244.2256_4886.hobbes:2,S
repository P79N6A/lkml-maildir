Hi all
A friend of mine asked me how he could restrict which ports a given user
should be allowed to open. He's running a shell server people use for
IRC bots. I don't think this is possible today. Is it possible to build
it without ruining the whole system? Like a kernel module?
Please cc: to me, as I'm not on the list
