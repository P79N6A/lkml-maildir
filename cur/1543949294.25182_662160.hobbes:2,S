The wear-levelling only makes all erase blocks/chunks/... wear out at
the same rate (at least more or less). It doesn't avoid or reduce
wearing out, it just distributes it.
Even if you do it: Make sure you have the better flash chips, not the
cheap ones with only 5000 (or so) write cycles. Or even MLCs ....
