Direct register access for debug ok, but not this is not ok for 
normal usage.

It should be. However, things like direct register access (for non-debug 
mode) may allow some controls that weren't visible via ioctl. That's why 
the sysfs usage may be evil: a driver may have some parts accessible only 
via sysfs interface, on a non-standard way, without offering the official 
API support. So, some device functionalities may be hidden from userspace 
apps that are compliant with V4L2.
Summarizing:
Linus patch seems to be the better solution to solve the V4L1_COMPAT bug.
I would also convert the other container_of stuff to to_video_device (to 
have code uniformity).
et61x251 direct register interfaces should be available only if 
CONFIG_VIDEO_ADV_DEBUG is selected to avoid its miss-usage. If there are 
other device configurations that needs specific register settings not yet 
provided, this should be provided via V4L2 standard ioctls.
This way, et61x251 will be compliant with V4L2.
I still think that we should work at the remaining sysfs classes to make 
them coherent on all V4L devices.
Cheers,
Mauro.
