Oh. It's the "Make patching more robust" commit.
"Robust" my ass.
We used to just copy the replacement in one go (works fine, since it just 
overwrote the two first bytes), and then "nop_out()" the rest (works fine, 
since it didn't matter for memcpy).
That whole commit looks a bit dubious. It also adds a 254-byte stack 
usage (anything actually even close to that big?). Gaah.
