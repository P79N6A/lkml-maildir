Thanks.  I'm going to add your patch into my local 2.6.5 and test it
out, but so far it's been nice and stable.

Will do.  Mostly, I'm just trying to see if my HPT302 is running a 66,
100, or 133.  Depending on which kernel I boot, I got different
numbers from /proc/ide/hpt366, so I'll see what I can find.

God knows what I'm talking about here, but you've given me some good
pointers here, so I'll play around and see what I find.  Thanks again
for your quick work.
Oh yeah, I did a quick audit of the other drivers in drivers/ide/pci
and none of the rest did any outb() or pci_write*() calls in the
various *_get_info() routines, so they rest should be ok now.
Thanks,
John
