All,
I compiled the 2.4.10 linux kernel on my Compaq Armada E700 P-III
where RedHat 7.1 - 2.4.2-2 was located.
I followed the directions using the "newbie" url
http://kernelnewbies.org/faq/index.php3#compile.xml
after several shots at it (more or less refining the type of configuration),
I was successful at creating a bzImage file.....loaded it......etc.
After rebooting the pc, I can't seem to get back to the login page.
It's a black screen.  I'm sure I have to check the graphics configuration.
Question:   How do I get back to some sort of prompt, so I can recompile
the kernel again?
thank you,
Lamar
