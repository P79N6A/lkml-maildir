Really not nice ... to the extent that we shouldn't do it.  The reset is
in exactly the correct place currently.  If we make it a requirement of
the ULDs its duplication and someone is bound to forget.
It looks like the problem is the warning in
base/driver.c:driver_register() apparently it wants an either/or for
->remove methods (either bus type or driver).  We're actually using the
bus_type methods, but we also have a driver component, sigh.  I suppose
what it's wanting is for me to add a scsi_driver type with remove
methods ... which looks a bit silly since all of the SCSI drivers want
different remove methods.
