Sorry, I used words in not usual way.
I refer "booting" as just resuming. And "after booted" means "after resumed".
In other words, I treat swsusp2 as not note PC's hibernation equivalent,
but just for faster booting technology.
So, What I wanted to say was,
  --- Reading all image in advance ( your way) slows resuming itself.
  --- Reading pages on demand ( e.g. VMware) slows apps after resumed.
Hope my English is understandable one...

In Japan, it is not so scary.
We have 100Mbps symmetric FTTH ( optical Fiber To The Home), and
more than 1M homes have it, and price is about 30USD/month.
With this, theoretically you can download 600MB ISO image in one min,
and actually you can download 100MBytes suspend image within 30sec.
So, not click to run (e.g. Java applet) but "click to resume" is not dreaming
but rather feasible. You still think it is scary on this situation?

 I don't recall the title now, sorry, and

I checked the URL but could not find the paper,
with keywords of "Cunningham" or "swsusp" or "suspend".
Could you tell me any keyword to find it?
