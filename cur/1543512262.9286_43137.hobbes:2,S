The devfs functions are largely compatible with the existing
functions.  If it turns out that this is a potential problem
with adoption the functions can be reduced so that it _only_
supports the standard device registration methods.
It will simply use the name requested (the one that goes into
/proc/devices) and create the requested number of devices.
If it is in compatability mode it even shows the proper
Major/Minor pairs.
I repeat: I have been able to take full advantage of devfs
with a completely devfs unaware driver.  The modifications I
made did not break the driver when devfs was uninstalled.
The changes in behaviour were only _visible_ with devfs, even
though they existed without it.
