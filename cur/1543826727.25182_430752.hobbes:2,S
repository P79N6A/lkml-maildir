What's the basis for that interpretation?  The language seems extremely
clear:
	"On successful completion, if the file size is changed, these
	functions will mark for update the st_ctime and st_mtime fields
	of the file, and if the file is a regular file, the S_ISUID and
	S_ISGID bits of the file mode may be cleared."
Why are you concerned about this?  Do you have an actual application
that breaks?
