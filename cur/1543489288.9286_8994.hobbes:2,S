Thats the point - Currently only very few people still run 
old pre 90 software for 8086 and it will be the same with Linux
and Merced. As soon as the Merced comes out no-one will use
old x86 binarys so i would prefer a little performance decrease
in x86 emulation than penalties with little endianess for years
in future. If we will have the chance of doing a cut to leave 
stupid decisions behind us we should talk about REAL issues
not history of Computer Hardware.
Also with the Emulation issue - CPU get better performance and
a little x86 performance penalty causes the application to run
at same speed as long as they are not native code.
