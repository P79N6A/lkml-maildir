Subject: no carrier when using forcedeth on MSI K8N Neo4-F

I am trying to connect two identical MSI K8N Neo4-F servers with NVIDIA 
nForce4 gigabit Lan ports. When the two ports are connected together via 
a crossover cable, neither computer is able to detect a carrier on the 
Lan ports and are not able to communicate. When either of the nForce4 
gigabit port is connected to a Lan port on another computer with a 
different Lan hardware or to a port on a switch the forcedeth drivers 
detect a carrier and are able to communicate.
It appears that the nForce4 Gigabit ports are not generating a carrier. 
Does the nForce4 not provide standard ethernet ports? If they are 
standard ethernet ports, how do I tell forcedeth to generate a carrier? 
Also how do I get forcedeth to run at a Gigabit?
Thanks for any help,
Best regards,
Arne R. van der Heyde
