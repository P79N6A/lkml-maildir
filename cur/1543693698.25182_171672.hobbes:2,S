Hi!

Reproduced on -test7-bk, vanilla.
I really do not think that 2 separate files (disk, state) are good
idea. It bitten me, again. I did echo -n platform > disk, echo -n disk
> state. Unfortunately kernel somehow decided that platform suspend is
not supported, but honoured second request. Result is crash, of
course. This error would be avoided if I said echo -n swsusp > state
(or similar), because unrecognized/unsupported request would be simply
not done.
What advantages does disk/ state separation have? I believe that echo
swsusp > state (or echo s4bios > state or echo disk-firmware > state)
is the right interface, and that we want to do echo "s4bios" >
on_battery_low or similar interface. (echo "mem" > on_battery_low
makes sense, too, toshiba notebooks do that for example).
