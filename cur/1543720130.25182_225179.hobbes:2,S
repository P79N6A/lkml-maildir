I saw something like this on a SiI 3114 controller, but then I thought it was 
because of a failing drive, since the second one that was attached to another 
SATA channel worked just fine at the same time.  I didn't try it with the 
acpi=off setting (the system was a dual Opteron w/ AMD chipset, and the 
kernel was a 2.6.7-rc1, AFAIR).
