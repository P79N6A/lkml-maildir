Subject: [PATCH] ppc64: kprobes breaks BUG() handling
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk

Hi,
I was running some tests and noticed BUG() handling wasnt working as
expected. The kprobes code has some code to check for breakpoint
removal races and only checks for one opcode. It turns out there are
many forms of the breakpoint instruction, comparing against one is not
good enough.
For the momemt remove the code in question so BUG()s work again and we
can discuss a better solution (I thought kprobes was emulating
instructions or running them out of line).
