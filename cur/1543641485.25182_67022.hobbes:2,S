I know it's stupid to check the battery every second, but frankly,
I haven't found a way to configure this in battstat_applet (of course,
it's possible by fixing the sources). Luckily, there's also battery_applet
for the gnome-panel, which has the same functionality, and additionally
lets you configure the update time. However, it doesn't look so spiffy :)

Stupid me hasn't thought of trying this, and I don't have my Thinkpad
right here now. Also -- what method does the `time' command use to measure
the time? It doesn't check the RTC, does it? And if the kernel clock stands
still during the /proc/apm access, `time' couldn't notice that real time
has passed, could it? Anyway, I'll try the `time' method this evening.

When I built a kernel 2.4.19 with ACPI, I also applied the latest patches from
acpi.sourceforge.net . This gave me /proc/acpi/battery/BAT0/state, reading
from which didn't slow down the kernel clock at all. (Sadly, ACPI doesn't
seem to report any events on my machine, so I'll stick with APM.)

Does this mean that the BIOS is buggy, or does this behaviour still
comply to the APM specifications? Just wondering.
