I figured out part of my problem.  In 2.3.24 I enabled
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA_PCI and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_IDEDMA and now hdparm -d1
works.  
I'm still convinced that I read something which made me turn those
things off.  Something will break I'm sure.  Maybe I'll get one of those
infamous attempt to write beyond end of device messages.
