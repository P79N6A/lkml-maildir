As you can see above, your mailer is still broken. Leading spaces get
removed and it seems like tabs are replaced with spaces. This makes it
really annoying to fix by hand because we all have to do your work again.
You should try to fix your mailer options, possibly by sending a few
mails to yourself or someone else (if you send *a few* mails to me, I
can confirm which one looks OK). If your mailer is definitely broken,
then you may send it as plain text first (for review), with a text
attachment for people to apply it without trouble.
Thanks,
Willy
