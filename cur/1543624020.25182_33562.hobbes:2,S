Using the terminology from the status page I guess this could be the smbfs
list:
Alpha		smbfs: I/O rewrite, smbiod
Alpha		smbfs: Fcntl locking + smb oplock support
Alpha		smbfs: smbconnect for better fstab integration
Planning	smbfs: Readahead support (async readpage/writepage)
Planning	smbfs: Read/Write request merging
But won't the list become very long if every little driver included all
the planned changes? Not my problem I guess ...
Also I don't know if any of this will be ready to be merged within the 6
month limit mentioned in one of the early announcements.
Regarding the updated statuspage, it isn't the "Samba filesystem", it is
the SMB filesystem (usually smbfs, SMBFS, SMBfs and possibly other
variations).
