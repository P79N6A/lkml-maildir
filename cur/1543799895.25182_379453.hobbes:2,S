Try finding the place where the supported PCI ids are written, and add your 
card's PCI ID. If the DRM module successfully detects your card, email the 
maintainers with the information (and ideally a patch which adds this 
information).
I don't know for sure, but according to this page:
http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/ATIRadeon#head-cef41521e55884edc9cd417b42fb2b8b4fcda672
"X300 denotes a rv370 based card."
This may imply that the r300 driver is useable with this hardware.
