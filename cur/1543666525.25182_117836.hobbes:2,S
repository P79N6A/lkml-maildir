I managed to get some ethernet cards going note eth3/irq211 and 
eth2/irq163 these are on nodes 4 and 3 respectively.
http://www.osdl.org/projects/numaqhwspprt/results/interrupts
requesting vector for node4/irq211
returning new allocation node4/irq211 -> vector0xc1
irq_setup: node4/bus9/ioapic8/vector0xc1 - irq211 c010b6bc

requesting vector for node3/irq163
returning new allocation node3/irq163 -> vector0xc1
irq_setup: node3/bus7/ioapic6/vector0xc1 - irq163 c010b588
