You have a bug somewhere!
At this point (output of Alt-SysRq-M), machine locked:
Jan  5 03:49:14 atlas kernel: Free pages:         512kB 
Jan  5 03:49:14 atlas kernel:  ( Free: 128 (128 256 384) 
Jan  5 03:49:14 atlas kernel: 0*4kB 0*8kB 0*16kB 0*32kB 0*64kB 4*128kB = 512kB) 
Probably you have "< instead of <=", or similar logic problem
somewhere.
Bug revealed itself during "mmap-sync" run. It's a program that
utilises bug with shared mappings (you used to send patches for that
one, I don't know if they made it to the tree, so I check
occasionally).
Other than that, VM is really fast, in fact unbelievably fast. Kswapd
is very light on the CPU and interactive feel is great.
