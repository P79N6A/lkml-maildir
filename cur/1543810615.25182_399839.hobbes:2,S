You're right, this doesn't make sense. I tried it with 2.6.15.4, and it works, 2.6.16-rc1 doesn't. In both cases no other AES algorithm than padlock was compiled into the kernel. I hope this helps.
BTW: 2.6.15 gives me a read performance increase of about 50% (hdparm -t) compared to 2.6.12, nice work!!
