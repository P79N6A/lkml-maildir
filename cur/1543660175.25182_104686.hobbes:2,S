Do you have that code working already (presumably needs locking changes)? 
I seem to recall something like that existing already, but I don't recall 
if it was ever fully working or not ...
I think the large PPC64 boxes have multilevel NUMA as well - two real
phys cores on one die, sharing some cache (L2 but not L1? Anton?).
And SGI have multilevel nodes too I think ... so we'll still need 
multilevel NUMA at some point ... but maybe not right now.
