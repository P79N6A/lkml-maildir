Please think before write. Windows98 fdisk could remove ONLY primary non-dos
partitions, not extended ones. You could remove all Linux partitions with
Linux's fdisk (just not forgot to run "FDISK /MBR" from Windows98 "MS-DOS mode"
to completely remove LiLo!) but this will not help Windows98 any jot -- Linux
will be rmoved but Windows98 will not work anyway :-)) If partition table is
not corrupt then Linux COULD NOT affect Windows98 when it's not running!
