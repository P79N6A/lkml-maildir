Yes.

I don't know. but this new one cannot be catched by overcommit_memory but
a user can consume not-reclaimable memory.
To be honest, I have to work with crash-dump. Sometimes cutomers request me to 
find out "how pages is used and why memory cannot be reclaimed ?" from dump.
So, I don't like unknown "1" reference to page-cache from some codes.
splice can increase this unkonwn 1 reference to some extent.
But I like idea of splice itself :).
