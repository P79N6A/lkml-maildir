I thought the lock_page_blocking was an alternative you had suggested
to the __lock_page vs lock_page_async discussion which got resolved later.
That is why I didn't make the change in this patchset.
The call does not block in the async case, hence the choice of
the _slow suffix (like in fs/buffer.c). But if lock_page_blocking()
sounds more intuitive to you, that's OK.

Sorry about that - I wanted to ask if you'd prefer my resending them to the
list, but missed doing so. Some people have found it easier to download the
series as a whole when they intend to apply it, so I ended up maintaining it
that way all this while.
