If it applies with not too many rejects, take it and fixup
potentially new config options.

  If Andrew's latest is a tarball or some sort of file (it is),
  I can redo it (with a big grumpy face ;-)

    You have to do it.
I think that's the typical way of doing things.
Documentation/SubmittingPatches only mandates latest kernel version 
(which most likely means Linus's tree), I could rebase.
Thanks,
Jan
