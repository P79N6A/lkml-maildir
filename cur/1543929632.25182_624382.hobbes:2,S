Hi Ingo,
  I have rebased to your sched-devel.git.  You were right, most of the patches
  were already there (1-20, in fact), so there remain only the last three.
  These constitute the "cpupri" moniker in Steven's testing.  Let me know if
  you have any questions.  Comments/review by anyone are of course welcome.
Regards,
-Greg
