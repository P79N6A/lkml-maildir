Do you mean to add
wall_jiffies +=  (ctime - sleep_start) * HZ;
or an equivalent at the end of timer_resume()?  I did and it helped a little.  
With it, the box hangs while executing device_resume() in swsusp_write().  
Without it, the box hangs earlier.
Still, it's sleep_start that has a wrong value, apparently (it shouldn't be 
negative, at least), and I see that Nigel has a patch that changes 
__get_cmos_time() on x86_64.  I'm going to try it in a couple of minutes.
Greets,
