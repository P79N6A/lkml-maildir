Indeed it would solve this problem, but I'm not sure there is a problem to
solve here. Have not found a case where ->port and ->iomem_base fields can
both be non-zero. If one of them is always zero then the previous patch hunk
in the "address in use" test at about line 2146 is well enough:
            if ((state != &rs_table[i]) &&
                (rs_table[i].port == new_port) &&
+               (rs_table[i].iomem_base == new_mem) &&
                rs_table[i].type)
                    return -EADDRINUSE;
Assuming one of the two fields is always zero, demanding both to match for
the in use condition works anyway. If the non-zero field matches, then they
both must match. The following hunk at the bottom of function get_pci_port()
at about line 3931 seems to guarantee that they start out this way:
	[[ The req struct is memset() to zero at about line 4009 in 
	  function start_pci_pnp_board(). ]]
        if (IS_PCI_REGION_IOPORT(dev, base_idx)) {
                req->port = port;
                if (HIGH_BITS_OFFSET)
                        req->port_high = port >> HIGH_BITS_OFFSET;
                else
                        req->port_high = 0;
                return 0;
        }
        req->io_type = SERIAL_IO_MEM;
        req->iomem_base = ioremap(port, board->uart_offset);
        req->iomem_reg_shift = board->reg_shift;
        req->port = 0;
        return 0;
Does anybody see a need to add the code anyway? Did I miss a lurker? 
Best to all,
