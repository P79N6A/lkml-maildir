Good day.
I was going through the menus for kernel configuration, and received an error.  The error was received when I tried to enter "Advanced Linux Sound Architecture" submenu from the sound support menu.  I was dropped to my terminal, and the following output was on my screen:
################ BEGIN QUOTE ################
Menuconfig has encountered a possible error in one of the kernel's configuration files and is unable to continue.  Here is the error report:
 Q> scripts/Menuconfig: line 832: MCmenu71: command not found
Please report this to the maintainer <mex@shout.net>.  You may also send a problem report to <linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org>.
Please indicate the kernel version you are trying to configure and which menu you were trying to enter when this error occurred.
make: *** [menuconfig] Error 1
[root@ip-two linux]# _
################# END QUOTE ################
I am running Mandrake 9.1, a gift sent to me from a friend via Cheapbytes.com.  The release version is 2.4.21-0.13mdk.  The machine is an i686 (Dell Inspiron 2500, Pentium-III).  If you need any further information, I'll gladly provide it if I can.  I have not tried any other configuration methods, such as those provided via the GUI or "make xconfig", and I would, if not for the late hour.
I hope this information helps, and have a good evening.
