The thinking behind there has been:
 a) arbitrary 64/32 division is _rare_, and shall be used only
    in places that are non-critical to system speed
 b) all places in filesystems, etc. should handle things by
    doing these things with  >>  operators, which of course,
    requires divisor to be power of two, and given as log2()
    of the divisor.
 c) to see usage of sub-optimal speed things, linkage against
    libgcc is expressly forbidden in kernel.
Thus when you see that  _divxyz3()  can not be linked in, the
bug is in its _need_, and thus the code, not in lack of library
to supply it!   The  do_div64()  is there to supply those non-
speed-critical rare uses.
At some platforms there is no way around this rule, but Linux's
primary platform is i386, and there those enforcements are shown.
To an extent, for example  Alpha  platform got several libgcc
functions copied in its arch library, to solve some unavoidable
builtin function needs, while still not blindly linking with
libgcc.
