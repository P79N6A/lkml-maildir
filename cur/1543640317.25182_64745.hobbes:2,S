Well, I'll probably be maintaining multi-sector PIO externally to the
main kernel in that case.  95% of ARM machines have either PIO only or
in the case of those that do have PCI DMA support (netwinders) the
southbridge is soo messed up that DMA is useless on most boxes produced.
Multi-sector PIO is a fundamental requirement that I require.
