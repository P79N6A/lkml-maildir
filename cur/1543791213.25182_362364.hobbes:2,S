Subject: [PATCH 1/2] uml: build host-binaries with the native host arch again
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

This patch reverts back the changes to HOSTCFLAGS and HOSTLDFLAGS
When we were building complete binaries to get constants (such as ptrace
register layout on stack) from host userspace headers, we needed to make the
arch for building HOST binaries match our one: i.e. on a 64bit system compiling
32bit binaries, we compile 32-bit hostprogs and need, say, 32-bit ncurses. Now
we can revert that - that avoids problem with, say, menuconfig and ncurses, on a
system which can't compile well 32-bit programs.
