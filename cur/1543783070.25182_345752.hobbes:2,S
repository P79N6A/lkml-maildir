At least the original die notifiers were designed as a generic debugger
interface, not a kprobes specific thing. So I don't think it's a good idea.
Given most debuggers don't need the early page fault hook and it's
mostly needed for a special case in kprobes, but it doesn't seem nice to only 
offer a subset of the hooks with specific config options.
Also with the inline the test should be essentially a single test of 
a global variable and jump. Hardly a big performance issue, no?
