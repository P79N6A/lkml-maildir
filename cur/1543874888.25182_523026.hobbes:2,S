I think this sounds like what Serge's did with his last patch, and
it sounds like the only reasonable thing we can do in this situation.
I had missed the fact the pipe is passed in at mount time.

Not really.  As long as the user space applications that trigger the mount
is in the pid namespace where the mount was performed or in a child of that
pid namespace it will has a process id that you can see.
If it happens that someone is entirely too creative and the process that
triggered the mount is in an entirely different pid namespace that does
not map __pid_nr will return 0.  Not perfect but at least it is well defined.
And a reasonable thing to return for a process you cannot see.
