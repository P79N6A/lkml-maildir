if you hear the clean output of 44.1kHz playback without noises, it
must be ok.

well, i heard that from VIA-tech guys, and i believed them :)
and, it could be a bug of motherboards.  (for example, there are mobos
with the revision 0x80, which didn't exist at that time.)
anyway, please let me know if 44.1kHz playback is ok.
then i'll add your patch to cvs tree, so that it's included in the
next patchset.
thanks,
