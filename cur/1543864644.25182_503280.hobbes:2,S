What are our standards for maintenance?  How can we tell in advance if
something is going to be maintained (cf. drivers/net/chelsio)?
I don't think you can seriously argue that just posting documentation
is going to guarantee that a device is going to get a high-quality
driver that runs on all architectures and that enterprise distros will
support.  And I don't think it's a good strategy to try convince
vendors to open docs by using happy talk about an idealized fantasy world.
