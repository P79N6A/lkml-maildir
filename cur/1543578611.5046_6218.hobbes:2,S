Well, this test only shows khttpd does badly for localhost, as it doesn't give
userspace a fair chance to schedule. It's too bad Christoph didn't test it 
with the persistent-connections patch that didn't get sent to Linus due to 
the "no more features" freeze (I don't exactly remember which of the freezes
though). 
Regarding wether either khttpd or TuX should be in the kernel: I take it
that it is your oppinion that neither should be in the kernel. I disagree
with that and I think having a http-server-engine  (or even a more generic
file-serving engine) in the kernel can make sense for high-end uses. The
average desktop-user doesn't profit from it, sure. But that also holds for
things like hardware-raid or even SCSI. We still want those in though.
Wether TuX or khttpd should be in... well. I agree with DaveM that TuX is 
certainly the "next and better" generation, and I look forward to working 
with Ingo and others on it.
