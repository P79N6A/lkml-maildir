Subject: [Patch 0/7] Per-task delay accounting
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

The following patches add accounting for the delays seen by tasks in
a) waiting for a CPU (while being runnable)
b) completion of synchronous block I/O initiated by the task
c) swapping in pages (i.e. capacity misses).
Such delays provide feedback for a task's cpu priority, io priority and
rss limit values. Long delays, especially relative to other tasks, can
be a trigger for changing a task's cpu/io priorities and modifying its
rss usage (either directly through sys_getprlimit() that was proposed
earlier on lkml or by throttling cpu consumption or process calling
sys_setrlimit etc.)
The major changes since the previous posting of these patches are
- use of the new generic netlink interface (NETLINK_GENERIC family)
with provision for reuse by other (non-delay accounting) kernel
components
- sysctl option for turning delay accounting collection on/off
dynamically
- similar sysctl option for schedstats. Delay accounting leverages
schedstats code for cpu delays.
- dynamic allocation of delay accounting structures
More comments in individual patches. Please give feedback.
