Hi Adrian,
sorry for the late reply, didn't find time to test it earlier.

Yes, works fine. No unresolved symbols.
FWIW, the modules psnap.o and p8022.o don't export a license and taint the 
kernel:
Warning: loading /lib/modules/2.4.26/kernel/net/802/p8022.o will taint the 
kernel: no license
  See 
http://www.tux.org/lkml/#export-tainted
 for information about tainted 
modules
Module p8022 loaded, with warnings
Warning: loading /lib/modules/2.4.26/kernel/net/802/psnap.o will taint the 
kernel: no license
Module psnap loaded, with warnings
Module appletalk loaded, with warnings
Other than that it works for me. Thanks for your help!
