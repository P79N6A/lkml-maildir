but sadly your second statement is not correct. Part of the complication is that all PCI config ops
operate on busses not devices; at first I thought "just add a bit and be done with it", but sadly it's
not quite the case. Due to the per-bus nature of the ops, you end up having 2 type of bus operations, 
and that's just boilerplate (prototypes, exports and stuff) but it makes up most of the lines of the patch
In addition, a separate raw_pci_ops (for x86 only!) is needed anyway since it's quite likely that 
we'll have various options of each case (extended or not) and we want to pick the best one for each case,
at which point you really do need the 2 variables.

that is what I implemented already in the patch that you commented on ;-)

not you as human, but "lspci" ought to yes.

the easiest one is an option to lspci. Nothing more nothing less.
Making a global knob in kernel space is a lot more tricky, and in addition
really there's enough cases where userspace wants the one device anyway
Doing the "for each device I'm about to dump" in lspci is pretty much as hard as doing
the global one (if not simpler)

see the patch. All pci_enable_ext_config() does is set a flag.
The architecture decides what to do with that flag. Golden
architectures can just totally ignore the flag and always expose
the full space. 
(In fact, the patch assumes all-but-x86 to be golden here; which is fair)
