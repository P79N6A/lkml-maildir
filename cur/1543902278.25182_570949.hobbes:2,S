Yes I know that X does it; I'm trying to write a new windowing system
which also does that, and the question is how they did it.  I would
have expected if I just open /dev/tty1, set raw mode, and set some
termios flags I'd get every key press and release; and it would be my
choice whether to use blocking or non-blocking I/O.
