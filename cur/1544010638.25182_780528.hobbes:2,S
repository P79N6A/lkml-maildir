The PadLock instructions don't use/touch SSE registers, but might cause
DNA fault when CR0.TS is set. So it is sufficient just to clear CR0.TS
before executed.
The AES-NI instructions do use SSE registers. Considering the following
situation:
1. In kernel, code path using SSE registers are executed, user space SSE
state is saved if necessary.
2. An interrupt/soft_irq comes, and encrypt/decrypt with AES-NI is
executed. The SSE state of code path 1 is destroyed.
To solve the above issue, the following methods can be used:
a. Do not touch SSE state in soft_irq
b. Disable/restore soft_irq in kernel_fpu_begin/kernel_fpu_end
c. Use a per-CPU data structure to save kernel FPU state during
soft_irq.
The mothod a is used in patch.
