Hi Wendy, Greg, all,
If IBM intends on our DPA management program to work for the JSM
products,
the ioctls are needed.
DPA support is a requirement for all Digi drivers, so it would
not be possible for me to remove them from my "dgnc" version
of the driver.
For the JSM driver, its up to you whether you feel its needed or not.
However, I would like to mention that the DIGI drivers that currently
reside in the kernel sources *do* reserve that ioctl space,
and is acknowledged by "Documentation/ioctl-number.txt":
> d'     F0-FF   linux/digi1.h
I understand that the list is not a reservation list,
but a current list of potential ioctl conflicts...
But the JSM driver sure doesn't add any new ioctl ranges,
or cause any new conflicts that didn't already exist.
Scott

Hi Scott,
The above three ioctls are for dpa/managment. If I removed these ioctls,
I have to remove jsm_mgmt.c(patch5.jasmine).
Do you mind I remove jsm_mgmt.c code now? From my side, I  don't think I
need them now.
Maybe we can have a solution in the kernel as Russell and Greg said
later.
Thanks,
wendy
