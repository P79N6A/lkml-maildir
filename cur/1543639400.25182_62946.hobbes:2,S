Hi all,
I could use some help with portability for non-x86 platforms.  In
particular, I need to figure out how to make crt0.[cS] to work on
various platforms, which unfortunately doesn't seem to be all that
obvious.  Unfortunately the SysV ABI creators didn't do the obvious
thing, which would have been to call _start() with its parameters
using the standard C calling sequence; instead, each platform seems to
put things on the stack in various ways (the sparc, for example, needs
a register window save area.)
a) If you'd be willing to write crt0.c/crt0.S for any platform, let me
   know. 
b) If you know where to get psABIs other than x86, x86-64, mips32 and
   sparc32, let me know.
c) If you know what #ifdefs one can use to test for any platform, let
   me know...
