Yesterday I posted an oops report. Today I've just arrived and the machine got 
an oops once again (at about 2am). It was almost unreadable because this time 
minicom was running and the output is a real mess, the only things clear were:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000004
*pde: 00000000
And below
process swapper (pid: 0
Then at the end the same kernel panic posted previously:
Kernel panic: Aiee, killing interrupt handler!
In interrupt handler - not syncing
It ran 2.2 before, and the only difference is that now mailsnarf is running.
If you need any other info, please just ask.
Thanks,
        Alberto
