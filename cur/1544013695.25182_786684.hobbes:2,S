The memory pressure is needed to force disk buffers out to disk sooner
than fsync() would normally force buffers out.  The scripts which I've
seen induced memory pressure.  If the disk is *super* aggressive at
reordering writes, I suppose a heavy fsync workload might be enough on
its own, but in practice, it's generally not enough.
