This has been needed for a long time, but now with the advent
of a reference counted struct pid there are real consequences
for getting this wrong.  
Someone I think it was Oleg Nesterov pointed out that this construct
was missing locking, when I introduced struct pid.  After taking time
to review the locking construct already present I figured out which
lock needs to be taken.  The other paths that access f_owner.pid
take either the f_owner read or the write lock.
