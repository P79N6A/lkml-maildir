Hi,
I'm currently using Linux 2.2.0-pre9 on a extf2-fs mounted as /. It's a glibc
system (SuSE 6.0), if that matters. Everything went fine until -pre8, and the
problems weren't fixed in -pre9, therefore I'm posting this, because I
believe fixing the following is a _must_ _be_ for 2.2.0-final.
First: /etc/fstab entry:
/dev/hda5   /mnt/d   vfat      user,umask=000   0   0
With -pre8 on, many programs I use began to behave strange when used on files
that are placed on vfat-partitions. So I started testing:
=== Cut ===
damware@damware:/mnt/d/temp/test > ls -la
total 64
drwxrwxrwx   2 damware  users       32768 Jan 22 00:24 .
drwxrwxrwx   8 damware  users       32768 Jan 22 00:23 ..
damware@damware:/mnt/d/temp/test > echo "test" > This_is_a_long_filename
damware@damware:/mnt/d/temp/test > mv This_is_a_long_filename t.txt
mv: cannot move `This_is_a_long_filename' to `t.txt': No such file or
directory
damware@damware:/mnt/d/temp/test > cp This_is_a_long_filename t.txt
damware@damware:/mnt/d/temp/test > cp t.txt This_is_a_long_filename
damware@damware:/mnt/d/temp/test > mv This_is_a_long_filename t.txt
damware@damware:/mnt/d/temp/test > mv t.txt This_is_a_long_filename
mv: cannot move `t.txt' to `This_is_a_long_filename': No such file or
directory
damware@damware:/mnt/d/temp/test >
=== Cut ===
I think this is pretty self-explaining, isn't it? I can do _exactly_ the same
on the extf2 partitions, it works perfectly. So it must be something in
connection with vfat. To everyone who's familiar with kernel hacking: Please
have a look at it and fix it!
You can sent me any source-patches for testing, you can ask me any question
about my system, I'll try my best helping you to get that fixed.
