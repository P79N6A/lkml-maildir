I think the ELF_NOTES mechanism is sufficient for communication between
two kernel. Because it can be written from user space tool in the kernel
A (/sbin/kexec via sys_kexec_load), and read from user space tool in the
kernel B (via /proc/vmcore). It can be used as user space communication
mechanism. So I think it may be not necessary to communicate with
initrd.
If we want to load the hibernated image with sys_kexec_load (/sbin/kexec
-l), we must add "multiple stages loading" feature to sys_kexec_load.
Because the segments in the hibernated image can exceed
KEXEC_SEGMENT_MAX (16) easily, considering there will be many memory
holes when free pages are excluded. Multiple sys_kexec_load must be used
to load a normal hibernated image. If multiple stage loading is
unavoidable, I think the better method to communicate information like
"jump back entry" and "backup pages map" is "multiple stage loading"
like you said in previous mail. And they can be encapsulated as
ELF_NOTES. So the only information need to be passed on stack is address
of ELF core header.

ELF core headers are in destination memory range of kernel B, so they
can be accessed by kernel B directly without knowing pages swapping in
kernel A.

For now, there is no information need to be passed from kernel B/C to
kernel A. But I think in the future, there should be some ACPI related
information need to be passed in this way, such as from kernel C to
kernel A: whether system is restored from ACPI S4 or ACPI S5. So I think
it is necessary to make it possible to pass some information from kernel
B/C to kernel A. But I think an ELF core header and some memory is
sufficient to do this.
