Hm. I NEVER seen such behaviour. Yes, X can lock keyboard and mouse sometimes
but to lock the whole system ???

Use Ctrl-Alt-SysRq :-)

Since X has full control over keyboard (raw mode!) you can not switch to other
console without X help... You can return keyboard from raw mode via
Ctrl-Alt-SysRq-R ... Atl-Fx will work then...
P.S. I assume you have kernel 2.2 with SysRq support enabled, of course...
