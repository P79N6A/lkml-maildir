I don't think it is a problem with the algorithms. It is, of course, with
the length of the critical sections, due to the fact that the Aironet
firmware needs serialized commands and some of them take a long time to
execute. To ensure serialization, a spinlock was used, but in that case it
could be hold for hundreds of milliseconds in some cases (waiting for the
command to finish).
If you have any suggestion about how to better deal with that issue, I'd
be happy to hear it.
