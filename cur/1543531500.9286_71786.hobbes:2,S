Disabling the interrupts could be a solution for your problem, I don't
know if it's the best solution, but remember to make just the assigment
with interrupts disabled, after it enable them.

Yes, t1, t0 and n should be in jiffies, all the internal kernel structures
uses jiffies (wait queues, timers, bhs, etc). And the n value should be
something like the time to processes 5-10 instructions.
