I'm trying to figure out all the ramifications of the new
"cycle_accumulated" field.  Does it really need to be
propagated all the way to the low level assembler (which
I don't want to mess with unless I really, really have to).
Can't I do the necessary calculations in update_vsyscall()
[Where I can do them in C :-)] and keep the same low
level assembly code.  I think I must be missing some
important bit of what is going on here.
