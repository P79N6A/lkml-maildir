I think I mentioned the per-node lru would be enough for numa, I'm only
talking here about per-zone lru, per-node numa needs are another matter.
For 64bit per-node or per-zone is basically the same in practice.
however after 2.6.4 will be fixed even the per-zone should not generate
loss of caching info, so with that part fixed I'm not against per-zone
even if it's more difficult to be fair.

I argue those scalability benefits of the locks, on a 32G machine or on
a 1G machine those locks benefits are near zero. The only significant
benefit is in terms of computational complexity of the normal-zone
allocations, where we'll only walk on the zone-normal and zone-dma
pages.

by the time you say 64bit you can forget the per-zone per-node
differences.  sure there will be still a difference but it's cosmetical
so I don't care about those per-zone lru issues for 64bit hardware,
infact on 64bit hardware per-zone (even if totally unfair) is the most
optimal just in case somebody asks for ZONE_DMA more than once per day.
But the difference is so small in practice that even global would be ok.
the per-node on numa (not necessairly on amd64, infact in amd64 the
penality is so small that I doubt things like that will payoff big)
still remains but that's not the thing I was discussing here.
