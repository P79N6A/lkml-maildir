Is there some way I can verify that the above works? I've tried the
following to try to get info on the reservation:
	# cat /proc/iomem
	# cat /proc/meminfo
	# cat /proc/slabinfo
	# echo m > /proc/sysrq-trigger
The only one that hints that this might have worked is the `echo m >
/proc/sysrq-trigger` in that I see the reserved pages count one larger
than using a kernel without this patch. Does this mean that the page I
reserved won't get used by Linux for any purpose?
