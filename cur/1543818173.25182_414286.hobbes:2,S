Since this is an RFC, here's my comments :)
This mechanism is designed to convert on-runqueue waiting time into sleep. The 
basic reason is that when the system is loaded, every task is fighting for 
cpu even if they only want say 1% cpu which means they never sleep and are 
waiting on a runqueue instead of sleeping 99% of the time. What you're doing 
is exactly biasing against what this mechanism is in place for. You'll get 
the same effect by bypassing or removing it entirely. Should we do that 
instead?
