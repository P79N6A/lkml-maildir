Sorry, to clarify they were ~650-700MiB tars but combined to around a ~4GiB
file later on (from the late 90s), CD's were cheap and yeah 2GiB limit.  But
later on to consolidate I moved them to 4GiB DVDs and thus tarred them together
and then gpg on top of that.

Once I restored the data from DVDs, I was able to restore *all* data 
successfully.

That works as well, but are they your regular files gzipped, no encryption?

Wow, I did not know ZFS had plans for de-dupe!! I will have to look into this,
thanks for the info.
