the partition table of the USB stick in question is valid:
 1B0:  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   53 3F 3C B9 00 00 00 01 ........S?<.....
 1C0:  01 00 06 10 21 7D 25 00   00 00 DB F3 01 00 00 00 ....!}%.........
 1D0:  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ................
   *
 1F0:  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 54   72 75 6D 70 4D 53 55 AA .......TrumpMSU.
Entry 1 is a FAT partition of exactly the size of the stick, and entries 2
to 4 are empty, marked by id zero. However the manufacturer decided to put a
name string  "Trump" ( /sbin/lsusb gives
Bus 004 Device 012: ID 090a:1bc0 Trumpion Microelectronics, Inc.) just before
the "55 AA" partition table magic and our code reads this string as a
(bogus) size for the fourth entry, taking it for real.
Please consider the patch for the main kernel distribution.
Cheers
