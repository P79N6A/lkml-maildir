Finally after all these years!!!! Sorry about the delayed response I was

Please do this. Its not only fbdev but backlight and display support.
Note display support is not main stream yet. Greg sent me a email about 
the DRM team needing a CRT class as well. That will be a different 
discussion. Plus some cards have tuners as well. So this device sharing is 
needed. It would also be really nice to prevent driver collisions. For 
example vesafb and a fbdev driver controlling the same hardware or acpi 
backlight versus the graphics card backlight support.
