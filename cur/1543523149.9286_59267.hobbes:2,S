I've seen this is well...And this time it's very reproducible, too. :)
I NFS mount my laptop's filesytem so I can read my digital camera's flash
card via the PCMCIA adapter, and when I first do a directory listing on
the mount point, I always see two of the first entry.  This happens in
tab-expand as well, and always goes away the second time.
