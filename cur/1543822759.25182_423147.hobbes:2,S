Maybe a process is now awaken because of a closed pipe, instead of a SIGCHLD
Process A, father/parent of process B. They share a pipe (A reads the 
pipe, B writes to)
Before
Process B exits, "atomically close all of its files and sending a SIGCLD 
to its parent"
Process A catch the SIGCLD.
After :
Process B exits "close its files (and the pipe), reschedule before final 
SIGCLD"
Process A gets the POLLIN/POLLHUP indication on the pipe -> Another code 
path is run and may trigger a user side bug ?
