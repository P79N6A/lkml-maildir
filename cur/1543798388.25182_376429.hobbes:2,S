Uh, I havn't even tried to build vgacon, it doesn't make sense for UML 
anyway.  It's not needed, my .config looks like this:
CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_HW_CONSOLE=y
# CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE is not set
CONFIG_DUMMY_CONSOLE=y
CONFIG_FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE=y
Should be trivially fixable with some Kconfig tweaks, I'll have a look.

What exactly?

Yep, there is no way around that because the uml consoles hijacked the 
vt subsystem's major #5.  Unlike in older versions of that patch this 
isn't a compile time but a runtime option, so it's much less annonying. 
The uml consoles are present unless you activate the vt subsystem and 
the framebuffer console by boot the kernel with x11=something.
cheers,
