It got much better now :-). We are even working on transactions support
and, if something fails, it restores the state of the stack.

There is "stg export" which could be made to export a patch
automatically at every change.

As I said in a different e-mail, we got patch history tracking in StGIT.
You can even annotate specific changes.
For editing, there is "stg edit [--diff]" which allows both description
and patch changes.
However, the StGIT approach is not fully suited for multiple developers
sharing the same set of patches, especially if they are allowed to
modify the same patches. For this kind of workflow, you can export the
series and add the patches to a separate shared repository. StGIT has a
"sync" command to synchronise changes to patches in different series
(either stored as quilt series or in a different branch).
