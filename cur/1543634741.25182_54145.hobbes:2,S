On that argument, we'll eliminate almost all Fibre Channel devices!
I think the qualification for appearing in driverfs is actually possessing a 
driver.  Therefore, we accept FC and iSCSI.  Things which appear as 
FileSystems are debatable, but not anything which has a real device driver.

Perhaps it's more a question of whether power management belongs as an every 
unit item in driverfs.  As you say, we get problems where the device is shared 
between multiple computers.
