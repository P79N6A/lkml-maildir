In addition, I haven't given on the idea one day of actually merging the
powerpc and sparc implementation of a lot of that stuff. Mostly the
device-tree accessors proper, the of_device/of_platform bits etc... into
something like drivers/of1394 maybe.
Thus if i386 is going to have a device-tree, please use the same
interfaces.
Ben.
