Would you like to give me a pointer to the patch? Is it one patch, or many patches?

Boot parameter "slub_max_order=3 slub_min_objects=16" could boost perforamnce
both on stoakley and on tigerton.
So should we keep slub_min_objects scalable based on possible cpu number? When a
machine has more cpu, it means more processes/threads will run on it and it will
take more time when they compete for the same resources. SLAB is such a typical
resource.
