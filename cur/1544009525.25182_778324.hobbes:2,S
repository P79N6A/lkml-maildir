Because this line should instead be:
	rdtp->dynticks_nmi = (rdtp->dynticks_nmi + 1) & ~0x1;
Well spotted, even if it did take me a good long time to figure out
that this really was a bug in my code!  ;-)
That said, you would have to really work to exercise this one...  Near as
I can tell, you would need to wrap the ->dynticks counter, which would
then cause the dynticks_nmi counter to appear to go backwards.  And then
you would have to prevent the newly onlined CPU from ever passing through
a quiescent state, which would cause a failure in any case.
Still, good to fix, even if I can't figure out how it would result in
a failure.  Real hardware and software tends to be -much- better than me
at finding such failures!
