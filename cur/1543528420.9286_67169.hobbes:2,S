well you can use kmap() for anything, not just high memory. I suggested
kmap() because ioremap() relies on a working allocator and other
higher-level structures - kmap() certainly works better for smaller
structures such as the MP-table. ioremap() has the advantage of being
arbitrarily sized. But i havent tested wether ioremaps above 4GB (in PAE
mode) actually work. (they should, but the interface is not capable yet.)
