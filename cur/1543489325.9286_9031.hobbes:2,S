I figured that they scanned l-k for email addresses, and then
spammed directly.  Still SPAM though IMHO.  SGI boxes are great

I did not appreciate the way that they did that.

Well, it looks like they picked and chose names from the feedback
I've been getting.  Probably looking for non-core developers and
others that are not yet full time kernel coders such as myself.
