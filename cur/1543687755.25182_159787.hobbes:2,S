I've repeatedly announced the updated patches at
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/lmb/md-mp/kernel/
 in the past (though the
URL has varied slightly), so feel free to pick them up.

I've done that for the multipath module. I've put my mp-test.sh at
ftp://ftp.suse.com/pub/people/lmb/md-mp/mp-test.sh,
 too. It comes
without any warranty or documentation besides the comments in the
script though ;-)
It has helped me tremenduously creating weird situations and making sure
the md module keeps track of all its associated gazillions of counters
'correctly'.
Sincerely,
