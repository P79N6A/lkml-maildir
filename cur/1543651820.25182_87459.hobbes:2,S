Please don't take this personally, but you just used another double
negative in your response. Now you may think that way, and talk that way,
but a lot of people who use Linux are not native speakers of English, and
from experience I suggest that the complex gramatical constructs in all
the help stuff should be avoided. Eschew obfuscation.

Then why have help at all? In fact why have the whole option if it can't
be used? I assume you meant something else entirely, other than "can't be
used."
