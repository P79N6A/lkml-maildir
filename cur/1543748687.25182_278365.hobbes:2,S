"Johanka, you really need to generate your own gpg key"
(Starts monitoring johanka by ps -aux, and when time is right,
attempts to read /dev/urandom to get same random seed Johanka got.
And BTW it could be made remote expoit if some application sends data
from urandom to the net. I'd not be surprised if some authentication
program generated challenges from /dev/urandom.
