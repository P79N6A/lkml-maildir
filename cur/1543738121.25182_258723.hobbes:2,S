Good practical point for the here and now. :-)
The discussion, though, is more about what it should have been.
The combined frustrations of many of us.
To colour the discussion a bit, many of us have had these same
frustrations with Sun, and HP on various issues.
Just say "it's a bug, but one we have chosen not to fix for practical
reasons." That would have kept me out of this discussion. Saying the
behaviour is correct and that POSIX is wrong - that raises hairs -
both the question kind, and the concern kind.
Cheers,
mark
