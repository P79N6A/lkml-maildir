TBH, I don't see the necessity of temporary files at all in this case,
but I assumed there must be a reason for them as the change already made
it into the -mm tree.
Why not use -o /dev/null, as Daniel Drake already suggested in [1]? In
both as-instr and ld-option, the tmp file is being deleted
unconditionally right after its creation anyways.
The attached patch is adapted from the patches proposed in [2], redone
as a replacement for
kbuild-dont-put-temp-files-in-the-source-tree.patch. Comments?
Kind regards,
 Horst

Do not write temporary files in as-instr and ld-option but write to
/dev/null, as the output is not being used anyways.
