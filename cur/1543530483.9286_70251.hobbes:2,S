Following the guidance to mount shm, I was able to get some (not all)
userland programs to work again.  However, one difficulty I discovered
is that if a "mount -a" is done (under 2.3.99-pre1), the system will
lock solid in about 10 seconds - only the reset button will recover.
This occurs whether a mount point for shm is defined in fstab or not.
The userland program that I noticed did work with shm mounted was
apache, and one that still did not was mysql.  Each is the binary from
the latest (woody) debian.
