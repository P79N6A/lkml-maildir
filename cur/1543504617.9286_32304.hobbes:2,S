I think you've got a point.  Put that's not going to stop me from coming
up with the best implementation I can, proposing it, and then at least
having the discussion.

I agree you could probably kludge something up with libc wrappers.  I
don't agree that it would be better than a very simple and elegant
solution in kernel space.  Which is what I'm trying to do.  And will post
eventually, but I haven't done any kernel hacking and I'm having to
learn the kernel as I go, which makes this a bit harder.

Which unfortunately changes the semantics of the fork system call.  I'd
rather always return the PID without CLONE_PID, or the TID when CLONE_PID
is used (since the PID is implicit in that case).  But I haven't quite
decided yet, because that's a little ugly in its own right.
