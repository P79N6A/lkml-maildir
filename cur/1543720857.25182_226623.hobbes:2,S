Sam,
I am doing sparse runs now on all of linus' and andrew's kernels.  Since
sparse is changing along with the kernel, comparing to older versions
will not buy us much right now.  As sparse stabalizes, perhaps this
would be an option.
For the sparse runs, I am building with allmodconfig (bzImage and
modules).
