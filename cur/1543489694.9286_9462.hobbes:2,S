Aaah, okay. I didn't know that.

No, it wouldn't. It's worse than you think. It's not just PCI config
setup problem. The doQuery() ioctl is called many times from within
Glide. For example, when running simple 'test3Dfx' program (which
just initializes the board, displays 3Dfx logo and exit), doQuery() 
is called 25 times or more. 
To make the driver safe, one would have to redesign the whole stuff
or... chg gur Tyvqr vagb gur xreary <very evil grin>.
