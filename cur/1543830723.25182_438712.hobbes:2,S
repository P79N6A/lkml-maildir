I guess this describes pretty much describes the goal and I don't think 
anyone really disagrees.
The question is now how do we get there? The current klibc patches give no 
answer to that, there is no documentation or any prototype, which would 
give a good idea how to get this stuff into initramfs in a manageable way.
The current responses indicate that the primary (or at least initial) 
users would be distributions, but there is no hint how the current klibc 
stuff can be used by them, which IMO is a serious problem.
The problem here is that we are about to create a new kernel-userspace 
interface and considering our track record here, I think it's a really bad 
idea to go into this practically blind. How will distributions put their 
stuff into initramfs?
bye, Roman
