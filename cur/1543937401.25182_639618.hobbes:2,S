Heh, indeed.  But we do seem to have a recurring problem of people
wanting to extend sys_foo() beyond the confines of its original API.
I've observed a few ways of doing that:
 - create sys_foo2() (or sys_foo64(), or sys_fooat(), or sys_pfoo(),
   or...) and add the new stuff there.
 - Put a version number into the API somewhere - wireless extensions,
   for example.
 - Set a flag saying "I've stashed some additional parameters somewhere
   else."  That's sys_indirect() and the current proposal for extending
   clone().
 - Just do it all with a kernel-based XML parser.  I think we should
   call this approach sys_viro() in honor of its champion.
 - Do it all in sysfs
The first approach has traditionally been the most popular.  If we have
a consensus that this is the way to extend system calls in the future,
it would be nice to set that down somewhere.  We could avoid a lot of
API blind alleys that way.
