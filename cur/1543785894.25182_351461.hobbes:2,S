You are ignoring the role of standardization. People invent their own
mechanism if a standard is missing (or virtually unimplementable). For
declaring encodings, there is no standard (except of iso-2022, which
is really hard to implement correctly). Therefore, editor authors
create their own standards.
Atleast Python abstained from creating yet another standard, and instead
supports both the declarations from Emacs and vim. To some degree, it
also supports notepad (namely through the UTF-8 signature).
However, people are much more likely to agree on a technology when it
is defined by a recognized standards body. This is the case for the
UTF-8 signature, which is defined by the Unicode consortium, for
precisely this purpose. Therefore, editors *will* agree on that
mechanism, while keeping their own mechanism for the more general
problem.

It's not the language designers who absolutely want this feature. It's
the language users. Of course, you'ld have to be a language designer to
know that fact - language users go to the language designers asking for
the feature, not to the kernel developers.

The specific feature I get is that when I pass a file starting
with <utf8sig>#! to execve, Linux will execute the file following
the #!. In what way do I get this feature for text in general?
And if I do, why is that a problem?

A script file (in the context of this discussion) is a text file
that is executable (i.e. has the appropriate subset of
S_IXUSR|S_IXGRP|S_IXOTH set), starts with #!, and has the path
name of an executable file after the #!.
More generally, a script file is a text file written in a scripting
language. A scripting language is a programming language which
supports "direct" execution of source code. So in the more
general definition, a script file does not need to start with
#!; for the context of this discussion, we should restrict
attention to files actually affected by the patch.

Be more specific. For what specific kind of file will cat(1) break?
Unless cat(1) has a 2GB limitation, I very much doubt it will break
(i.e. fail to do its job, "concatenate files and print on the standard
output") for any kind of input - whether this is text files, binary
files, images, sound files, HTML files. cat always does what it is
designed to do.

This is true for any UTF-8 file, or any multibyte encoding. For any
multibyte encoding, the number of bytes in the file is different from
the number of characters. That doesn't (and shouldn't) stop people from
using multi-byte encodings.
What the editor displays as the number of "things" is up to its own.
The output of wc -c will always be the same as the one of ls -l,
as wc -c does *not* give you characters:
       -c, --bytes
              print the byte counts
You might have been thinking of 'wc -m'.

It depends on the editor I use, of course: the kernel will consider any
CR after the n as part of the interpreter name. Not sure what this has
to do with the specific patch, though.
