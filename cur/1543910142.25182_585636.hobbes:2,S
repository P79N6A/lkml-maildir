removes MODALIAS from one of the events, this breaks user space applications 
like openct - everything that depends on getting an event that has both the
DEVICE= path to the usb device and any information on the interface, so it
can check if the device is something it supports (in case of openct:
smart card reader, i.e. bInterfaceClass 0b).
The text does not mention MODALIAS nor the reason for it's removal.
sorry for being late, this problem shows up with 2.6.21 -> 2.6.22 changes.
