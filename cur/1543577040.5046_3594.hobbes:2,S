Hi Hans,

Yes, I mean test13-pre[12134567] and other older versions too.
I've already had the problem some time ago with an older 2.4.0-testxx kernel.
I don't think it is directly related to the ax25 stuff but maybe (?) a timer
modified elsewhere ?

Possible too. These compilers problems (which one for which kernel) are a bit
boring...  Anyway, I've downloaded the correct version of the compiler and
retried the operation.
[root@debian-f5ibh] ~ # gcc -v
Reading specs from /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i586-pc-linux-gnu/egcs-2.91.66/specs
gcc version egcs-2.91.66 19990314 (egcs-1.1.2 release)
The result is the same than with the other compiler.
