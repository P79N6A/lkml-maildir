I'm not aware of any other missing constants.
Just, having seen the missing syscalls which were presumably accidental,
I put forward that someone might wish to audit the other architectures
for missing definitions from other arch-specific header files.  Not just
asm/fcntl.h, but also e.g. asm/termios.h and others.  The idea is not
specific to the ARM port.
