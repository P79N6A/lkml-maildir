Hi!
When machine supports both S4 and S4bios, S4bios mode is prefered and
it is not possible to enter S4 by swsusp.  echo platform > disk then
does nothing. This makes S4 take precedence over S4bios if only one of
them would be available as the result.
[As a side note, I believe that 'echo "disk" > state' is wrong
interface for S4bios, as it requires completely different setup from
the user.]
Please apply,
								Pavel
