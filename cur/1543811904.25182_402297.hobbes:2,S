The mount indeed took more than ten (wallclock) seconds during which
the lockups occured, and after that it seemed usable (I rebooted
shortly after because I feared fs corruption).  Normally, this mount
takes 2 seconds or so - it's a crypted 200GB XFS partition.  The same
goes for the "bugged" kernel with "nosmp": mount is finished quickly.
