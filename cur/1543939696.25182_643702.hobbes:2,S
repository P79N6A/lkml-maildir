Subject: [PATCH] linux/types.h: always export 64bit aligned defines
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/26/45

Some kernel headers exported to userspace rely on these 64bit aligned defines.
However, they are hidden behind __KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES at the moment which
means most of the time, they're never actually available.  These these defines
dont actually conflict with normal userspace / C library types, there's no
reason to hide them behind the __KERNEL_STRICT_NAMES define.
