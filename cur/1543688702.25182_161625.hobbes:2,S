No, just another BUG in my head: I mistook X86_GENERIC for X86
- How BRILLIANT to _hide_ X86 away in arch/i386/Kconfig - it 
is even inaccessible ....
mainmenu "Linux Kernel Configuration"
  config X86
	bool
	default y
	help
	  This is Linux's home port.  Linux was originally native to the Intel
	  386, and runs on all the later x86 processors including the Intel
	  486, 586, Pentiums, and various instruction-set-compatible chips by
	  AMD, Cyrix, and others.
Couldn't one have a better way of handling this ?

Michael
