I was using at sem_close(), sem_destroy90, sem_open() ...
according to Posix.4, these are defined in semaphore.h - but
are not defined in /lib/modules/<uname -r>/build/include/semaphore.h
Are Posix.4 calls only for userspace?

Attempting to use syscalls intended for userspace while inside the kernel
is generally regarded as Bad Juju.
'man semctl' says:
     Under  Linux,  the  function semctl is not a system call, but is imple-
       mented via the system call ipc(2).
#define __NR_ipc                117
is what you weren't finding in unistd.h
