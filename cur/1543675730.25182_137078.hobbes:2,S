It's worse: if a system is brought up for reduced operation, e.g.
with init=/bin/sh for repair work, it is not uncommon for /proc to
be absent.
Since it is not immediately obvious for a user whether a given
program depends on /proc or not, just crashing in such a situation
is clearly a case poor user interface design.
