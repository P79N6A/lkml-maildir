I was looking for this fix just yesterday.
This patch works on my system.  You might want to take the extra step
and fix the PCI device id list, too:
% lspci | grep Unknown
00:00.0 Host bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2531 (rev 04)
00:02.0 PCI bridge: Intel Corporation: Unknown device 2533 (rev 04)
