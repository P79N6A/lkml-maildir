Ok, so this is a pretty major flaw of the idea, thats why I put this
concept out there, any suggestions as to how to get around this?
Possibly add some checking to disable certain functions in the child
when the enable_setpresuid function has been called?.
Or save the signal handlers the first time setpresuid is called, and the
next time, restore them so if the child has changed them, they get
re-set back to their initial state?
I know many people are against the idea of adding new functions at will
to the kernel, thats why I am trying to flesh out all the potential
problems and find solutions to them first.
