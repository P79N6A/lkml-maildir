Shouldn't you have (!error || error != AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE), since the fs can
return AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE if it needs vfs to try the readpage again?  Things
like OCFS2/GFS2 do this, they send of a lock request and return
AOP_TRUNCATED_PAGE so that when we come back into readpage we are already
holding our lock without blocking while holding the page lock.  Thanks,
Josef
