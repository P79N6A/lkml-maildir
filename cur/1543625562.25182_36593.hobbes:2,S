The last line of reasoning is faulty, because sys_init_module()
does  atomic_set(&mod->uc.usecount,1); before calling init_sg()
or init_sd(). Thus, it's not only possible, but it is guaranteed
that the counter is non-zero when control gets
to scsi_register_device_module, and to the failure path.

Guaranteed to trigger BUG() is out_of_memory gets set.
I still think we better kill this check altogether.
Any more objections?
