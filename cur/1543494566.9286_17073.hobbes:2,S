Ok, I have 2.0.36 kernel and i do process accounting. 
All log files and process accounting are on same partition.
So, today i discovered that this partition is full, and pacct
file is huge, ok, with accton switched process accounting off,
did cat /dev/null > pacct and then swithed accounting on again.
But, then noticed that dmesg was full of oopses, and, process accounting
file was again huge. none of the oopses was recodred in logfiles, 
because probably the kernel started to oops after partition was 
full.. So, the question is: What does 2.0.36 kernel when partition, 
where it does accountig, gets full? Just oopses ? Anybody to repair it ?
Is it any better in recent 2.2 kernels ? (just thinking about upgrade.. )
