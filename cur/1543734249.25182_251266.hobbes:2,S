You are missing my point - I do not say we need to *activate* the 
framebuffer, just link the mode setting (and other hardware dependent 
code) into DRM driver.
This is kinda like vesafb driver is doing now - if I don't pass vga=XX 
parameter on the command line it does not touch the graphics card.
Thus, even if framebuffer support is not compiled into the kernel the DRM 
driver is able to reinitialize the card into a sane state.

This is a good point - if we don't need DMA or 3d acceleration we can 
reduce memory footprint. This would seem that current DRM driver would 
need to be dependent on whatever driver contains the mode setting code.
What do you think ?
