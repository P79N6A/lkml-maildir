If accept2() behaves as I suggested, it does the call to socket() for you,
so it would indeed save a syscall.  (And you only need to do the F_SETSIG,
etc. on the initial prototype s_client once; after that, accept2() would
just copy the settings.)  But that's not why I like it so much; read on.

Ghost read events can confuse user code and make it think it's hit
the end of file.  Translating your example
    while (read(s) > 0) {};
    close(s);
to event-driven pseudocode yields
    do {
       sigtimedwait(...)
       ... 
       if (event is 'fd now readable') {
           if (read(fd) == 0) {
               terminate connection, other end closed
           }
       }
A ghost read event could cause this code to terminate a new connection prematurely.
This isn't a performance problem, it's a reliability problem.  
Or at least a complexity problem; I'm sure there are workarounds for this,
but I don't know how simple they are.
