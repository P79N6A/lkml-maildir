   Would it be more helpful if I were to check something like
     socki_lookup(file->f_dentry->f_inode)->ops == tcp_prot
   instead?
No, helpful would be for you to present us with a test case program
and the network device configuration you are using.  Are you using
netfilter?  Are you using tunneling, these sorts of things.
Basically, the things we would need need to know to be able to
duplicate your precise setup here locally in hopes of triggering the
problem ourselves.
Later,
