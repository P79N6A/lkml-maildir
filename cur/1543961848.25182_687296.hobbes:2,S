Well, Andrew *did* object to the complexity.  But that wasn't
the point I was making there:  you were comparing apples and
oranges ... which makes it particularly easy to reach desired
conclusions like "only *this* one tastes like oranges!".

No I didn't.  But that's why I liked Ben's suggestion of creating
sysfs nodes for each gpio_chip.  That's actually a good example
of why folk like the one-value-per-attribute model with sysfs, at
least for information that would be used with scripting.
