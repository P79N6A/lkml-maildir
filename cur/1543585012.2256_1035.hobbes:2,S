 It is a known problem yes. And just as Rik says its has been adressed
 in 2.1.x by Alexey for first time.

 CONFIG_NET_HW_FLOWCONTROL enables kernel code for it. But device
 drivers has to have support for it. But unfortunely very few drivers
 has support for it.
 Also we done experiments were we move the device RX processing to 
 SoftIRQ rather than IRQ. With this RX is in better balance with 
 other kernel tasks and TX. Under very high load and under DoS 
 attacks the system is now manageable. It's in practical use already.

 Thanks Rik. 
 This is work/experiments by Jamal and me with support from Gurus. :-) 
 Jamal did this presentation at OLS 2000. At NordU/USENIX I gave an
 updated presentation of it. The presentation is not yet available form 
 the usenix webb I think.
 It can ftp from robur.slu.se:
 /pub/Linux/tmp/FF-NordUSENIX.pdf or .ps
 In summary Linux is very decent router. Wire speed small packets
 @ 100 Mbps and capable of Gigabit routing (1440 pkts tested) 
 we used.
 Also if people are interested we have done profiling on a Linux
 production router with full BGP at pretty loaded site. This to
 give us costs for route lookup, skb malloc/free, interrupts etc.

 I'm on netdev but not the kernel list.
 Cheers.
