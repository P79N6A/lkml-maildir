Maybe you want to switch on this option and tell us some
more useful information  ;)
- system hardware configuration  (how much memory)
- running X or not
- compiler version used to compile the kernel
- what do you see after the system 'hangs' and
  you type sysrq-T, sysrq-M and/or sysrq-P ?
regards,
Rik
