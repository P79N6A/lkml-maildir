 asking "ordinary" people to do that is unrealistic: surely you know
 that?
 i just spent two hours helping a friend who wasn't familiar
 with the concept of "give root password for maintenance or
 press ctrl-d" they'd been pressing ctrl-d because it said so
 and now i'm going to have a 5-hour round-trip journey and possibly
 an overnight stay to sort out the mess.

 yes.  the concept is not incompatible with what i said: the only bit
 that is wrong with what you've said is the word "Nope".

 part of the coverage of the MAC is file and directory permissions, and
 as i mentioned earlier, it so happens that each selinux permission
 corresponds, i believe one-to-one, with a function in the dnode and
 inode vfs higher-order-function tables in the linux kernel.
 example permissions (from postfix.te, policy source version 18):
	allow postfix_$1_t { sbin_t bin_t }:dir r_dir_perms;
	allow postfix_$1_t { bin_t usr_t }:lnk_file { getattr read };
	allow postfix_$1_t shell_exec_t:file rx_file_perms;
 i am confident enough with selinux to say that those are file
 and directory permissions.
 (r_dir_perms is a macro that expands to directory read
 permissions { read getattr lock search ioctl }, and
 rx_file_perms is a macro that expands to { read getattr lock
 execute ioctl })
 what this is saying is that postfix_$whatever_t context is
 allowed to read the contents of /sbin and /bin; it's also
 allowed to know if symlinks in /bin and /usr actually exist,
 and also allowed to follow those symlinks; and it's also allowed to
 know if shell-scripts exist, and also to read and ultimately
 execute them.

 this is a good thing.

 *sigh*, tell me about it.  well, when reactos gets its NTFS driver, i
 will be sure to let you know.  i promise :)
