Hmmm. The BIOS doesn't know that you have a kernel without any
floppy code. The BIOS also doesn't know that its timer queue
is going to be destroyed by the data (code) that it's properly
reading from some disk. All it knows is that every time the
floppy is accessed, the motor must be turn ON before access
and must be turned OFF two seconds after the last access. Since
it doesn't know when the last access will be (it doesn't know the
future), it resets a timer-variable upon every access. The timer-
queue bumps the variable and if it gets to zero, turns OFF the
FDC motor.
The BIOS code is properly doing its job. When control is
taken away from the BIOS, the code that took control must
tie up any loose-ends that the BIOS wasn't able to finish.
It's not the job of the boot-loader because it didn't alter
the BIOS in any way. It used the BIOS to put the kernel in
it's correct place. Then it gives control to the kernel
code. It's that kernel code that takes control away from
the BIOS. It's the responsibility of that kernel code
to handle the consequences of doing that.
Cheers,
