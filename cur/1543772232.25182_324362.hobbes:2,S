It makes sense to sandwich other kinds of device accesses.  I don't
think the previous clear/read_pci_errors() interface was intended *only*
to sandwich readX().

I'm not sure we need this.  Surely it can be deduced from the pci_dev or
struct device?

You do know that ioread32() doesn't take a pci_dev, right?  I hope you
weren't counting on that for the rest of your implementation.

"Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon 
the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those
conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse
to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince 
himself that the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep 
he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception." -- Mark Twain
