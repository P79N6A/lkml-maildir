Hi Charles,
I may have missed this, but do you have the APIC or IO-APIC enabled?
The patch in question merely moved where the 0x40 descriptor was installed
in the descriptor table.

The 0 above initialises the base and limit parts of the descriptor and
should be zero as it is filled in later (or should be).
The 0x00409200 means this is a byte granularity (0x800000 not present)
32-bit (0x400000) present (0x8000) memory (0x1000) read/write (0x200)
descriptor.  The 32-bit part should be irrelevent as this descriptor
should only be loaded into the DS register (that bit only affect code and
stack segments).
The base and limit parts of the descriptor get initialised at run time by
the code:
	set_base(bad_bios_desc, __va((unsigned long)0x40 << 4));
	_set_limit((char *)&bad_bios_desc, 4095 - (0x40 << 4));
These could be set statically, but it was easier to use the availble
macros.
