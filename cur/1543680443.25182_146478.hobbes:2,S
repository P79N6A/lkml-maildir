You misunderstand.  The 2.4.15 direct_IO hook was _not_ conditionally 
defined.  It appeared in the middle of a stable series, yes.  It has a 
feature macro, yes.  But the definition of the hook in 
include/linux/fs.h does not _change_ based on a define.  That is what I 
mean by a conditional hook definition.
It is far less trouble for everyone to add a new hook, instead of 
changing an existing hook, in the middle of a stable series.

No doubt you can find more :)  That doesn't make the right thing to do, 
though :)

We cannot just-fix-up filesystems which are not in-tree, which is what 
the KERNEL_HAS_O_DIRECT2 define would be mainly used for.  In-tree 
filesystems would just unconditionally use the new, or old, interface as 
they chose.

The higher-level problem was that we didn't want to change the VFS 
API...  otherwise we could have simply used the new interface, and 
converted all in-tree filesystems.
