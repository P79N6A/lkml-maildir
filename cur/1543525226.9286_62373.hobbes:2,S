I can kill any of them. Have you heard, e.g. for such thing like a ReGet for
windoze? Have you seen how this "smart" program opens 300+ ftp sessions for
a same file which is happened to be a 600+ Mbyte image of a distribution
CD? And it's not the end of the intelligence of a beast, it sends an ABORT
after each portion got (several Kbytes) and then tries to reget from the
aborted position. They are smart, they do know they will get the file even
the connection is flaky... I don't even know how to combat this other then
filtering those who has been caught redhanded out...
But 2.1.125 does live with e.g. heavy loaded Squid. 2.2.xx don't.

Alan, I have YOUR kernels in my stock. Actually my distribution have been
built around 2.2.5-ac-something. We do use 2.2.10-ac10 with some version of
devfs as "stable" kernels. I'm talking about VANILLA 2.2.*. Neither of them
builds outta the box with my configuration chosen for making a distribution
kernel package. Having your patches applied, some of them do.
