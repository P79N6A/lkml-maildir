Thanks.

I was stupidly using: SMP kernel thread coding
The truth is that I have a piece of code running in the kernel which is
performing OK when running on a mono-processor and which is just a
disaster on SMP... (about 10 time slower).
I'm trying to understand the reason of this, so even out dated
documentation is welcome (the concept can be more important than the
details).
