th efull name should be "CPU Disconnect Function". it is an the page 
with "enhanced pci performance", "enable system bios caching" ".. video 
bios caching" and all the spread spectrums. I have forgotten the name of 
that page in the main menu. Should the 3 or 4 in the first column.
Perhaps your BIOS is too old. I remember it only came with 1.8 (or 
alike) and later. But usually this setting should be disabled at default.
My machine still hasn't locked, btw. :-)
