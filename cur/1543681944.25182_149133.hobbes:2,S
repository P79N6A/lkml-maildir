That sounds fine, and is the same as what I did for usb host devices.

That's "prettier", but probably requires a lot more work in every v4l
driver, right?

I'd say you should try for it now.  It's required if you want support
for things like udev in 2.6, which is what a lot of people seem to
want...
I know there are still a few other subsystems that need this kind of
change in 2.6, so you are not alone (input, misc, parallel port, sound,
etc.)
I'd be glad to help you out with this if you want.
thanks,
