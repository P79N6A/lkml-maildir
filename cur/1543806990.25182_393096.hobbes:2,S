Exactly. They are not two different "approaches", it is just a simple
optimization.
In our approach each process has pair of pids: one is global unique identifier
(read, it is real pid from viewpoint of kernel), another is virtual pid.
We just do not want to lose cycles allocating both of them all the time,
so we derive virtual pid from global one, it is automatically "virtually"
unique.
Switch to "sparse" mapping happens _only_ after migration, when a process
must be recreated with the same virtual pid, but with new global pid.

Of course. Logically, it would be final solution.
VPID approach is pragmatic: it does not modify existing logic, rather
it relies on it. So, it just allows to use virtual pids in a simple
and efficient way, which is enough for all known tasks.
