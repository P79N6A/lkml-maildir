Sure, but with Michael's approach, the only hook was get_msi_ops(pdev) 
Anyway, there isn't -that- much that can be done generically in the HV
case. Mostly some argument sanity checking, the logic for saving &
restoring pdev->irq for MSIs, that sort of thing.

I understand.

Quite possibly yes. I'm pretty sure it will work on IBM HV but we aren't
really supposed to use it...

That and the saving & restoring of pdev->irq. That is not very much.
