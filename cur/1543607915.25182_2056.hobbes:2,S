I have a question related to this.
If a driver ioctl handler requires
    (filp->f_mode) & FMODE_WRITE
to be set before processing a request, and if only
root has write permission to the device file, does this
make it unnecessary to check for
     capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN)
?
If we were to use the write permission bit to control
access, then it would not be necessary for the apm
command to be setuid root to give the non-root user
the ability to suspend the machine.  Instead we could
    chgrp apm /dev/apm_bios
    chmod g+w /dev/apm_bios
and add the trusted user to the 'apm' group.
Am I missing something here?
