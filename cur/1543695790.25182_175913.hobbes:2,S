OK, I tested 2.6.0-test9-mm1 + your patch, but it seems not to print any 
messages or stack traces, even if many processes are killed after setting TCQ 
depth to 1.
Today, however, I got reiserfs corruption messages in the logs, but 
fsck.reiserfs could not find any corruption on the next boot, so I think this 
is not a real corruption but just reading the wrong data...
The messages are something like:
Oct 31 07:57:53 bigboss kernel: is_tree_node: node level 2120 does not match 
to the expected one 1
Oct 31 07:57:53 bigboss kernel: vs-5150: search_by_key: invalid format found 
in block 642544. Fsck?
Oct 31 07:57:53 bigboss kernel: vs-13070: reiserfs_read_locked_inode: i/o 
failure occurred trying to find stat data of [4767268 4767269 0x0 SD]
