We have been doing it since June, but we also immediately _re-enabled_ 
them.
And the moment we _didn't_ re-enable them, people started sending in 
bug-reports. So the "since June" is clearly true only in a very limited 
sense.
A more correct way to say it would be that within hours of releasing a
test-kernel (not even a real release) that _really_ disabled the links, we
got people reporting boot failures.

Now, the clearing the entire ELCR thing has been tested by all of three 
people, all of whom saw problems with the non-clearing thing. So not only 
is the base for that claim very thin indeed, the small base was totally 
self-selected, ie statistically completely meaningless even if it had 
been much much larger.
Nobody who didn't actually see the problem in the first place would have 
tested it.
IOW, I'll claim that the only thing that has really gotten testing since 
June is the thing that disables and immediately re-enables the links.
And that's exactly why I think the "minimally disruptive" fix is to not
disable them at all, but just fix up ELCR for anything that was already
enabled. Since that _is_ what "disable + re-enable" ends up actually
doing.
See my argument?
