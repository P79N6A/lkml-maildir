If the version number didn't change, then the kernels are using the same
driver.  I haven't been tracking the 2.4.10pre series, so I don't even
know what version is in there.
Please upgrade to v6.2.3.  By default it will dump lots of interesting
debug info when a timeout occurs.  You may need to use a serial console
to catch all of it.  The driver can be found here:
