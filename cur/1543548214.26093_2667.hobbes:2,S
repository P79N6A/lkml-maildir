You're right, but what you're missing is that with "noflushd", it was
possible to keep the disk spun down _even with pending writes_.

These suggestions are good for laptops because they reduce the amount of
pending writeback, even with "noflushd".
However, they still don't save you from spinning up the disk when you
_do_ write something and you have enough RAM to hold the data for a few
hours until you must spin up the disk.
E.g. you might compile a program or send some mail.  These things write
to the "disk", but you don't have to really spin up your disk if there's
enough RAM to hold the pending writes.  With laptops, people are willing
to assume the RAM is reliable -- accidentally pulling the plug out won't
lose the data.
