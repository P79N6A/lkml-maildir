I'll play with this a little when I get home..
I don't understand though why implementing the SW scrollback should
cause the penguin to have to be moved to the other side of the screen!
maybe make it user-configurable?

Yes, but as I was using the defaults, I couldn't pgup to the top of the
part I wanted to read. I was able to read messages /quickly/ during
bootup. Now, I find I have to read even quicker.. or use dmesg when my
eyes can't track that fast :)

Nope, not using SVGATextMode since 2.1.105 or something like that..
Really, theres a space of a few pixels above the penguin, which text
scrolls through.

Will forward to you personally tomorrow. (I'm at university now)
