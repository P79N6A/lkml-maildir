Keep in mind that while the text of the program IS SHARED any 
configuration file that is then loaded into ram after the execution IS 
NOT SHARED.
BTW you can find out what is shared and not by taking a look at the proc 
files:
# ps auxwww | grep emacs | grep -v grep # -- find the pids
user       21529  0.2  0.3  16784  7560 pts/11   S+   14:27   0:00 
xemacs -nw
user       21549  0.2  0.3  16784  7548 pts/12   S+   14:27   0:00 
xemacs -nw
# cat /proc/21529/maps |grep xemacs | grep "r-xp" # -- find the mapped 
text executable

/usr/bin/xemacs-21.4.19-nomule
# cat /proc/21549/maps |grep xemacs | grep "r-xp" # -- find the mapped 
text executable

/usr/bin/xemacs-21.4.19-nomule
#ls -li /usr/bin/xemacs-21.4.19-nomule # -- confirm that 201672393 is 
the inode we're looking at.
