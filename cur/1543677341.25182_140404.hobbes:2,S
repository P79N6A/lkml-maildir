Subject: ptrace/kmod local root exploit STILL unresolved in 2.4.21! - MY MISTAKE

I've tested this exploit in wrong way. I've first logged in as root, then I
made "su nobody" and then exploit worked.
If I don't login as root at the beginning, I get operation not permited.. so
kernel is safe after all :)
Thanks 4 your time
