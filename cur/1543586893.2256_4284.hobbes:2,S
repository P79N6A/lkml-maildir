I just upgraded to modutils 2.4.5, and my sound modules wont autoload
anymore. They work fine if i manually load them but that is an
unacceptable solution.
alias char-major-14 sb
options sb io=0x220 irq=5 dma=1 dma16=5 mpu_io=0x330
options sound dmabuf=1
Those are the lines ive always used in modules.conf and have always worked
till i upgraded.
Any suggestions? Please CC me im not on the list.
