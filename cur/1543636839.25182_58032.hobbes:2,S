This seems to have tons of stuff which makes it compile, but which is just
broken. Randomly changing "cli()" to "__cli()" apparently just to make it
compile, with no warning that its now buggy.
It's doubly wrong by virtue of the fact that you apparently left
"save_flags()" and "restore_flags()" alone, and changed their semantics
rather drastically.
Ugh. That should not happen. Either it compiles and is expected to work,
or it shouldn't compile (very limited config is fine, of course).
Robert, willing to take a look too?
