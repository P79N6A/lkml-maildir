Normal users can use an environment provided for them.
While trying to figure out why the "heyu" program would not
work on a Red Hat box, I did just this. As root I set up all
the device files needed, along Debian libraries and the heyu
executable itself. It was annoying that I couldn't try out
my chroot environment as a regular user.
Creating the device files isn't a big deal. It wouldn't be
hard to write a setuid app to make the few needed devices.
If we had per-user limits, "mount --bind /dev/zero /foo/zero"
could be allowed. One way or another, devices can be provided.
