OK.
Another thing I am wondering about,
is why the lapic produces the NMI on
my Athlon so slowly. It is something
like 1 NMI in 20 seconds or so. And
it looks like the frequency changes
from one boot to another.
It didn't work properly with any kernel,
so maybe the lapic itself is buggy,
but maybe this is a kernel's bug that
can be debugged out somehow? Or is
there anywhere something that allows
me to specify the frequency? The rate
I currently have, is really pretty
much useless for anything.
