Are they dog slow after a *cold* start?  My solution to slow Maxtor drives 
was to fix the CPU fans in my machine and put the main drive in a bay cooler. 
 The drive wasn't spewing bad data, so it wasn't the drive controller 
overheating.  That leads me to believe that the motor (or the motor control 
DSP) was overheating and degrading performance on that route.  Trying that 
will save you lots of hours toying with hdparm like I did :).
Good luck..its a sucky problem but once you get it fixed your machine will 
seem like new!
