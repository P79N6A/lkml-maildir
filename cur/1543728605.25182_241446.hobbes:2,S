Dear.Sir/madam,
I know that this proposal  might be a surprise to you
but do consider it as an emmergency. In a nutshell,I
am Miss Ann Camara 20 years old from the republic of
Sierria-Leone in west Africa,now seeking for refuge in
Dakar Senegal under the(UNHCR).
I got your contact from where i was searching a good
penpal for a possible transaction. My (late) father
Dr. Lamine Camara ,was the managing director of
Rainbow Gold and Diamond Mine company
in(KENEMA)Sierra-Leone.But he was killed along side
with my mother during the longing civil war and all
his properties was totally destroyed.
However, after their death I managed to escape with
with a very important document (DEPOSIT
CERTIFICATE)(US$10.5m)Ten million Five hundred
thousand U.S Dollars deposited by my late father in a
security company ) as a family treasure which I am the
next of kin.The money was deposited in security
company here in senegal.
Meanwhile,I am saddled with the problem of securing a
trust worthy foriegn personality to help me transfer
the money over to his country and into his possession
pending my arrival to meet with him.
Furthermore,you can  contact the security and finance
company for confirmation and i will issue a letter of
Authorisation on your name,that will enable the
security and finance company to deal with you on my
behalf.
I am giving you this offers as mentioned with every
confidence on your acceptance to assist me.
Conclusively,I wish you send me a reply immediately as
soon as you recieve this proposal.
Until then,
I remain with the best regards.
Miss Ann camara.
