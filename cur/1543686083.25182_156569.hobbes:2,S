after thinking a bit, i believe, you're right here. Initially, i just
wanted to have an option to mess with this register, but there is already
the setpci tool which can do exactly this. So for now, i just added the
setpci command to my modules.conf and i'm set.
It's just a shame that PCI/Cardbus bridge manufacturers try to save a few
cents by not soldering the configuration EEPROM to their board and supply
some specialized drivers for Win just to make their crap work. So if you
place 2 different cards in the same PC with the same PCI1410 but different
pin mapping, you're doomed...
