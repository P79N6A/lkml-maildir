Ok. It's just that every provider of the _kernel_ interface to user
space has now to take care of being posix-compliant. Write the code for
checks, iow. That is not the case for "open", for instance.
And besides, with the patch applied the kernel is also posix compliant,
isn't it? Noone still answered why the check in library in this case.
(The patch is not applied yet, btw)
