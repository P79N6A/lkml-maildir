     Peter is incorrect.  You are likely using a Linux version that still 
     thinks a 10 GB drive is a misreport.  Either update your linux version 
     or change the lba sanity check in the ide.c file.
     Search for the text _10_percent.

Is your bios reporting the correct size of the drive? If not, you need to 
get a bios overlay to recognize a drive bigger than 8.4G. For a white paper 
on the subject, read this:
