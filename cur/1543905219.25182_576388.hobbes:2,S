I'd say most likely scenario is the SERVER is behind a Cisco Pix firewall,
which has known bugs in handling packets with sack option.  By default the Cisco
has sequence number randomization enabled, but it's a half-assed implementation
which doesn't bother adjusting the sequence numbers inside sack options.
This has been reported to Cisco, and they don't seem to care.  As a workaround,
you can do this:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_sack
and it will probably fix it up.  It'd be really nice, however, to have a per-route
option for sack, similar to how we can clamp window scaling per route.  Something
like the below
	ip r a <host> <gw> <nosack>
