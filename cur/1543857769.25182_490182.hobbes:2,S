Thanks Andreas ! I was expecting something around that patch indeed, I
suspect something in Apple device-tree is dodgy and breaking the
new generic PCI irq parsing (for example, at first sight, it's a PCI
device with 2 interrupts, which isn't allowed by the PCI spec).
I'll dig a bit more when I get to the office where my crash box is, and
will do a fix.
Ben.
