Ok, I'll apply that patch and be on the lookout for this warning.

Well on this partition hidden names could have been created either by:
a) bash, and mc with files like .bash_history, etc.. (all standard stuff)
b) courier-imap which creates directories for IMAP folders, like:
   .My Folder
   .Sent
   .Trash
For now, I have no clues about it.
