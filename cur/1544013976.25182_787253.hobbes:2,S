FWIW, on s390 with gcc 4.3.2 and an allyesconfig I get these:
  CC      arch/s390/mm/extmem.o
arch/s390/mm/extmem.c: In function 'segment_modify_shared':
arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:572: warning: 'end_addr' may be used uninitialized in this function
arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:572: warning: 'start_addr' may be used uninitialized in this function
arch/s390/mm/extmem.c: In function 'query_segment_type':
arch/s390/mm/extmem.c:259: warning: 'vmrc' may be used uninitialized in this function
Switching off PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES makes the warnings go away again.
