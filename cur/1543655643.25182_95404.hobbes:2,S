Ug. Now that a wider test base is being done and more drivers actually
compile we are going to see more cracks.

Thanks. I have had several emails complementing the speed improvements.
Another speed boost will be a plus.

Fixed. Actually I used the following code.
int fb_pan_display(struct fb_var_screeninfo *var, struct fb_info *info)
{
        int xoffset = var->xoffset;
        int yoffset = var->yoffset;
        int err;
        if (xoffset < 0 || yoffset < 0 || info->fbops->fb_pan_display ||
            xoffset + info->var.xres > info->var.xres_virtual ||
            yoffset + info->var.yres > info->var.yres_virtual)
                return -EINVAL;
        if ((err = info->fbops->fb_pan_display(var, info)))
                return err;
        info->var.xoffset = var->xoffset;
        info->var.yoffset = var->yoffset;
        if (var->vmode & FB_VMODE_YWRAP)
instead. The reason is I didn't like the idea of xoffset and yoffset being
changed even if the hardware panning function failed. Comments?

Fixed.

Fixed.

Will test on hgafb driver.
