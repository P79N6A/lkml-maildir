Yes, having a not-very-random hash function makes this worse.  What we see 
is: the attempt to improve locality by having the hash function preserve 
certain input bits can easily produce a net loss by causing a big variance in 
hash chain length, increasing the average length of the list walk.  At some 
point I'll go check this theory for the pache cache (in fact I think it's 
already been checked, and a paper written about it).

A more random hash improves (4) too, by allowing a smaller table.
Though somebody may well come up with a better structure than a hash table 
for the page cache, I'm pretty sure we can make the existing approach work a 
little better.
We could divide up the locking using pcache_locks [page_hash >> some_shift].
