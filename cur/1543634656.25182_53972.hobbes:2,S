Yes, we could (for example) assume a DP264 board, it features 2/4/8
way memory interleave, dual 21264 CPUs, and 2 separate PCI 64bit 66Mhz
buses.
However, multiple busses are *rare* on x86.  There are alot of chained
busses via PCI to PCI bridge, but few systems with 2 or more PCI
busses of any type with parallel access to the CPU.
