Regarding the problems with the nvidia driver on 2.5.44, the 
problem is, as Dave suggested, the GPL-only workqueues. I changed 
(for personal use) the relevant EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPLs to 
EXPORT_SYMBOLs in workqueue.c. It works quite fine even though it 
is a bit unstable.
Adding a MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") line to the nvidia driver would 
have been quicker but I don't somehow think that's allowed :)
Cheers,
Ashwin.
