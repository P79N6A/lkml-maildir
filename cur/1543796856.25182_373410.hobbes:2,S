There are critical kernel parts for which automated regression testing
is very hard.  In some twisted sense, regression testing ist best done
by those who run real applications, i.e. end users.  The interesting
thing is that you end up with reasonably stable software this way,
except in a few corner cases.
The main point of debate seems to be how relevant the corner cases
are, and how much general kernel development should care about them.
(And no, not everyone in such a corner has $$,$$$ to spend.)
