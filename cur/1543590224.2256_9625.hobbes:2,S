heh, and then these things will be expensive, so few will buy them and
they'll remain in older process technologies (like .21u) because there's
no economy of scale, while CPUs jump ahead to fewer and fewer microns
(.13u, .10u), and in a moore's law doubling or so someone will come up
with the bright idea to move everything back to the CPU again and use
mostly dumb i/o devices.  (or they'll use a bunch of general purpose
computers clustered behind inexpensive switches to achieve the same
thing at a fraction of the cost.)
we've never seen this happen before!  :)
