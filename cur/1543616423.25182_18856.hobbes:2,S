Good point, but its ppc64 so the patch would include all of
include/asm-ppc64 and arch/ppc64 :)
I expect most architectures have a reasonably fast find_first_zero_bit
so they can simply do:
static inline int sched_find_first_zero_bit(unsigned long *bitmap)
{
	return find_first_zero_bit(bitmap, MAX_PRIO);
}
