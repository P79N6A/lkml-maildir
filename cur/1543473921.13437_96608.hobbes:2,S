As I already mentioned, XF86_FBDev does nothing of the sort. It's just a
stupid frame buffer driver.

So are you going to duplicate all of the other X servers inside the
XF86_FBdev driver? Be my guest, but don't expect me to think very highly
of the project.
I assume this will be a non-issue once XF86 4.0 with loadable acceleration
modules are out, then it's just a matter of just not using the mode setup
code. But again, I don't see why there would be a XF86_FBdev at all even
then.
