Yes, this is the worst part.  Having to synchronise threads.

Completely hairbrained, would make no difference to scalability, and
make accessing your user space data structures slower.  (Think X window
ids and the need to use a hash table instead of a flat table).
O_ANYFD would, in principle, improve scalability.  It was proposed a few
years ago -- it means "kernel can return any fd, not necessarily the
next free one".  I don't think it was considered worth the effort.
