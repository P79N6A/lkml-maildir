My aic7xxx is compiled in (tagged command queuing turned off).  I get
no warnings about incompat modules.  This morning I copied over the
aic7xxx files from 2.2.13 into the 2.2.14 source tree -- regenned
and it WORKS.  So my latest guess would be that the changes made to
the aic7xxx driver between 2.2.13 and 2.2.14 are the culprit.
