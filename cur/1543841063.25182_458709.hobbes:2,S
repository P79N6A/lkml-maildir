knowing what processor and chipset the memory is attached to will tell
you what ram you need about 99% of the time.

They are physically different form factors (168 pin dimms vs 240 pin
dimms) motherboards exist that will take both (ali or via chipset
mainboards) but they can't use it at the same time and typically they
