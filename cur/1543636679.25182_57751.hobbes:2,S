Short answer: Don't.

Well, first of all I'd rather discourage doing so in general. However, XFS 
is split into subdirs, so you could probably take a look at their latest 
CVS to see how it's done.
Basically, use only one Makefile and
	blah-objs := blah_init.o blahstuff/blah1.o blahstuff/blah2.o ...
in there.
