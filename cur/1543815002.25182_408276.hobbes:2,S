i've released the latency-tracer patch for v2.6.16:
   
http://redhat.com/~mingo/latency-tracing-patches/latency-tracing-v2.6.16.patch
max scheduling latencies can be tracked via the enabling of 
CONFIG_WAKEUP_TIMING. Tracking can be started via the resetting of the 
max latency:
	echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/preempt_max_latency
if CONFIG_LATENCY_TRACE is enabled too then an execution trace will be 
automatically generated as well, accessible via /proc/latency_trace.
if CONFIG_DEBUG_STACKOVERFLOW is enabled too then the function tracer 
will also track the maximum stack-footprint observed in the system, on a 
per-function-call basis. New maximums are reported to the syslog 
immediately. (which can be quite verbose during bootup.)
(the latency-tracer has numerous other features as well, such as 
userspace-triggered kernel-tracing, irq-triggered tracing, max 
preempt-off or irq-off tracing, trace-to-console-via-early-printk for 
the debugging of early bootup crashes, print-trace-at-crash, and more.  
See past postings and the code for details.)
