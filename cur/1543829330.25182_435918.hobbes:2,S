urgh, we worked all this out several weeks ago.  Forget.
Looking at the patch, I guess the problem is the
config AGP
	default y if GART_IOMMU
which doesn't dtrt if you already have AGP=m.
The patch does this, instead:
config GART_IOMMU
	select AGP
which gives us AGP=y if GART_IOMMU=y.
I don't think Jeff has sent us an example .config, but I hit this a few
times too, before we fixed it.  I think this was all triggered by a Kconfig
change in the AGP tree, so you wouldn't have seen it, but -mm did.
