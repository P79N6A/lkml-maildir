It's true that some early init stuff is based on the static tables
and doesn't require the interpreter.  But there is a lot of stuff
that DOES require the interpreter, like finding PCI root bridges,
PRTs, PCI interrupt link devices, etc.  It's not clear to me that
it's feasible to deal with all these from userspace.

Before the interpreter, you don't have ANY devices (legacy ones are
described via the namespace of course, and PCI devices depend on root
bridges that are also in the namespace).  So you end up at least
requiring a ramdisk, plus a bunch of encoding to communicate resource
information from the interpreter to the drivers.
Maybe not impossible, but it certainly requires a lot of work.  Moving
the interpreter to userspace has been proposed many times, but I've
never seen any indication that anybody is actually working on it.
