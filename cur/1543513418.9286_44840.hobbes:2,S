Peer PCI busses to be more accurate.  The problem is that the PCI probe
code will probe the peer busses that are behind a 451NX chipset without
needing a bridge device to guide them there (which is correct) but in
order to make legacy PCI probe code from other OSes work on the system, HP
put some "fake" bridge devices on pci bus 0 that *also* point to the same
busses as the peer bus configuration registers on the 451NX chipset.  Net
result, we probe the bus twice.  There is a patch that fixes this in the
2.2.12 kernel we shipped, and I also gave that patch to Martin and it has
been forward ported to his 2.3 stuff.  It handles more than just the 451NX
chipset, it also does the two RCC chipsets that have peer busses and it
handles the Compaq hot plug PCI chipset in use on most 8way x86 boxes
today.

      they should be everybody's.
