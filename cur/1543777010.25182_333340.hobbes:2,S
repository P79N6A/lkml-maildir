That's not necessarily true. Most people use 'nice' to have the cpu bound task 
not affect their foreground applications, _not_ because they don't care how 
long they take. I nice my kernel compiles and keep web browsing etc (actually 
I run them SCHED_BATCH but this has the same effect with the default ondemand 
governor now).
