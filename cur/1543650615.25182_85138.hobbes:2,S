Yes they are in their own table.

I've created simple, useful modules that only use one hook.  But SELinux
uses allmost all of them.  So there is no simple answer for this
question, sorry.

Many of the LSM hooks are _very_ time critical (every read() call for
example.)

Yes, that is a place of active disagreement among the different LSM
developers.  Some people like it, others don't.  Right now the current
implementation allows you to stack LSM modules if you want to, but you
are not forced to if you don't.
Also, I really don't like the use of the term "hook" for describing the
LSM functions, as you can see how people get confused about this :)
Some other term, like "callback" might be a better term.
