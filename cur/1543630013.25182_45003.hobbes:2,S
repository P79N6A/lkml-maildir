   The concern with moving one (major) application into the
   kernel is that this will weaken the testing/motivation to get
   zerocopy, aio and sophisticated notifications working well
   for userspace.
Actually, to the contrary, TUX was in fact an impetus for the
userlevel zerocopy and AIO bits :-)
I personally don't see anything wrong with something like the
TUX engine being in there.  At the same time I want to reiterate what
Ingo said which is what we can do in userspace catches up to what
TUX can do then we pull it out and move on to the next thing :-)
