The biggest impediment that I saw with F_NOTIFY was the inability
to distinguish _which_ directory generated the signal.  This was
especially problematic for multithreaded apps.  Also I would have
a chance of missing the signal if they pile ontop of each other.
Everytime I was interupted from my sleep() by a signal I would
have to scan _each_ directory to find the next file.
I admit, however, that the current F_NOTIFY has more functionality
then the current select().
Plus, for our programmers, it is a stylistic choice.  They prefer,
and better understand, using select()/poll() versus signal io.
