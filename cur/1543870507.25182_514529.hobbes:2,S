Andi, Linus, we have some critical bugfixes for the VMI paravirt-ops code.
Please apply.  If there are objections to certain pieces, they can be
reworked, but they are pretty much all needed for correctness.  We are
hoping to get these in the next 2.6.21-rc release.
We had quite a few difficulties debugging after the integration of the
hrtimers code, which is why this took so long.  Andrew, add you on
the list in case any further hrtimers integration issues pop up.
Thanks,
Zach
