The TTL must be decremented by at least one for every hop.  It's only if it's 
at the one router for a second or more that TTL works in any way other than a 
hop count.
I've just done a test of this on a network with:
Linux server ==ethernet== Linux 2.2.9 router ==PPP 33K6 modem== Linux 
workstation
I started pinging the Linux server from the workstation (120ms ping time and 
TTL of 254).  Then I started transfer of three medium sized files over the 
modem link from the server to the workstation.  Ping time went up as high as 
5570ms, but the TTL stayed at 254.  The 2.2.9 router was obviously where the 
packets were being delayed.  This is a bug in the Linux kernel, I don't have 
access to a network that allows me to test 2.2.14.  Has it been fixed?
