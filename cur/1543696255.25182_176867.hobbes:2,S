Why would you want to?  The kernel has determined that 92MB of the stuff 
in memory is less important than the disk cache.  For example a program 
requires 100 MB data for boot and then spends the next week using the last 
5 MB.  Do you expect all 100 MB to stay resident in memory for ever 
(while the program is running)?  Of course not, it'll get swapped out once 
it is determined to be less used than the disk cache and only that last 5 
MB which is actually doing something will remain in RAM, with the rest 
quietly sitting in swap.  Swap is slower than RAM, sure, but using RAM for 
storing your dirty laundry from two weeks ago is pointless - and that's 
why it's swapped out - the disk cache will likely accelerate stuff more 
than keeping the odds and ends in memory.
Now, if you have lots of cache and the system is swapping like crazy - 
then something is wrong, but only then.

I wouldn't agree with that - It'll still swap via R/O text executable 
pages, so you'll still have swap, just invisible.
