Correct, that part of the Intel MP specification: if 2 different cpus
are
used, then the capabilities of the second cpu must be a subset of the
capabilities of the first cpu. (IIRC)
Probably you must edit smpboot.c or init.c and clear the capabilities of
cpu0 that cpu1 doesn't have.

Could you run the oops through ksymoops?

Ok, cpu0 support fxsr, cpu1 doesn't.
fxsr is used for the thread switching.
It seems that this causes an oops during the first thread switch.
Could you try what happens if you replace
linux/include/asm-i386/processor.h:
- #define cpu_has_fxsr        (test_bit(X86_FEATURE_FXSR,
boot_cpu_data.x86_capability))
+ #define cpu_has_fxsr		(0)
If that doesn't work, then check where X86_FEATURE_FXSR is used.
