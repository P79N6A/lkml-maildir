Yes. In my case worse than annoying:
The drives spin down, but have not yet completed spindown when
the machine is started again. LILO fails (prints a single 's'
where I would have expected "uncompressing kernel" and dies).
Pressing reset results in a strange garbled BIOS screen, and a hang.
After a power cycle all is well again.
So, my hardware is very unhappy with the new 2.5.42 behaviour.

[2.5.33 works for me, but no later kernel does.]
