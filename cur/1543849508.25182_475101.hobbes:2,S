Yes, it's probably still correct after your patch. I just referred to
the sensible rule that necessary headers should be directly included
where they are used, not indirectly via other headers.

Me neither. I manually cleansed the ieee1394 core's and sbp2's includes
recently; this is a mind-numbing janitorial job.

On the surface, tools like LXR and cscope "know" where function are
declared or macros and types are defined. But oftentimes, other headers
than these tools turn up are to be included by API users. Cf. the
definition of atomic_t. (IOW the "necessary" header is not always the
one which has the actual definition.)
