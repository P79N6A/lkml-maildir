Unfortunately I am no expert in FAT related stuff but I assume that textual stuff stored in a filesystem shouldn't affect mounting and unmounting. The only thing NLS changes in a filesystem is special charakters for filenames but it doesn't change the technical structure of the FS itself so in worst case I only get some strange characters shown in filenames.

Do you have both nls_cp437 and nls_iso8859_1 modules loaded?
