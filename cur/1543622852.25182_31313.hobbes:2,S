When doing (say) ext2-on-loop-on-ext2 you should always ensure
that the blocksize for the topmost filesystem is the same as
the one underneath.  So probably you wanted `mkfs.ext2 -b 4096'.
If you have a 1k blocksize filesystem loop-mounted on a 4k blocksize
filesystem, every write of a 1k block requires a read of the underlying
4k block. Which is excrutiatingly slow.
Some readahead in the loop driver would help heaps.
