That is not the right thing to do, FYI.  That will mean that each time
you boot (even after clean shutdown) you will get an fsck.  Instead,
you should change the mount count (-C), or the time it was last checked
(-T on more recent tune2fs) to force it to fsck.  That will make it a
one-time event.
Yes, you could also touch /forcefsck or whatever, but that would force
it for all filesystems, again probably not what you want.
Cheers, Andreas
