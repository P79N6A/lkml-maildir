I'd agree for VT8233 and VT8233A according to some searches I did this
morning. However, the VT8231 doesn't seem to fit in the list. Here are
the facts I am aware of that led me to this conclusion:
* It seems to appear only on specific boards, such as the Epia ones, and
is rarely mentioned on common hardware sites, compared to all the other
ones.
* It was presented by VIA at the Cebit in march 2002, which corresponds
to the release of the VT8233A.
* The support was added to the i2c-viapro driver in May 2002, that is,
after VT8233 (October 2001) and VT8233A (March 2002.)
* Its PCI ID is completely different (0x8231, while all other supported
devices are in the 0x3000-0x31FF range.)
So I think it doesn't exactly fit in the release timeline, and is more
likely a custom product derived from the VT82C686 (A or B) rather than a
linear evolution.
For this reason, I won't extrapolate the results to the VT8231. I will
only enable I2C block support for it if someone with such a chip agrees
to test the support first.
Thanks,
