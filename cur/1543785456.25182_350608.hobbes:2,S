The last variant would be preferable if we go in that direction...

Frankly, I don't see the rationale for combination of
	* allowing anyone see all processes in top-level directory and
visit their directories, chroot or not
	* allowing anyone see /proc/<pid>/task/*, unless separated by
chroot (note that we allow that regardless of process ownership, etc.)
	* disallowing to see /proc/<pid>/task/* if leader is or used to be
outside of our chroot.
IOW, it's either too weak or too strong; current rules make very little
sense, regardless of the behaviour when group leader dies.
