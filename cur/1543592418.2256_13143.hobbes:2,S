In the specific instances that I know about, the f/w for the older Qlogic SCSI
cards (the drivers *not* supplied by vendors) for qlogicisp (qlogicisp_asm.c)
and qlogicpti (qlogicisp_pti.c) is in the Linux source *and has been for
years) with no copyright attribution whatsoever. qlogicfc has the BSD style
copyright that I partly, but mostly Theo Deraadt of OpenBSD, managed to beat
QLogic into doing.
Versions of f/w for qlogicisp && qlogicpti can easily also be had with the BSD
licence- check any *BSD distribution, or pick 'em up via bitkeeper from my
site.
