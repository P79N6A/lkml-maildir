From what I understand, this patch drastically reduces the number of
I/O PTEs that are needed in the iommu. With the current static IOMMU
mapping, it should only make a difference during initialization, but
any platform that uses a dynamic mapping of iommu entries will benefit
a lot from it, because:
- the card can do better prefetching of consecutive memory
- there are more I/O ptes available for other drivers.
