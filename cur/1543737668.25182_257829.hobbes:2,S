No go here. My milleage certainly varies :)
Still the same ugliness here with T1. As before, there goes some info
attached, which I could collect while barely up and running.
I don't wanna be a PITA, but changes are hardly noticed since T0.
Next I'll try building with CONFIG_SCHED_SMT off, and later with
CONFIG_SMP off too, to just try to make some point here.
