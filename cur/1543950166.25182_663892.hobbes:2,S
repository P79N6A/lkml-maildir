I have some more information on the timer interrupt activities in the
system.  I have obtained the following trace from irq_exit and local
timer is the only interrupt on CPUs 1, 2 & 3.

This is over a short interval where I complain that the tick is not
really getting stopped.  Actually there is a pattern of 400ms timer
being programmed.
Apart from these there are 4ms pattern on one of the CPU that is used
to drive tick_sched_timer.  Most of the missing trace entries are CPU0
which takes care of all the idle daemon process.
There are wakeups due to kondemand and other kernel threads on CPUs 1,
2 & 3, but the time is in seconds.
Please help me find the source for this timer.
Thanks,
Vaidy
