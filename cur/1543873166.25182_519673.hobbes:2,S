NACK.  block device driver should never ever play around with file
operations themselves.  If you want functionality like the one you
have please don't overload the loop driver, but start a new (character)
driver doing specificaly what you want.  And even then I'm not sure
we'd want functionality like this in the mainline tree, but at least
we can have an open discussion if it's done properly.
