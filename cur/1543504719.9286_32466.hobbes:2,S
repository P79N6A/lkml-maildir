That's better than the current situation, but the ideal (IMO) is for the levels
to remain exactly as they were before the driver was loaded.
Consider the following case, which is quite common where people feed their 
music through the computer to the amp:
	1. Switch on CD player.
	2. Set sound levels.
	3. Exit mixer program.
	4. Sound module auto-unloads.
	5. Something opens /dev/audio. Sound module reloads. 
		--> Mixer settings are reset, however briefly.
We shouldn't see even a momentary glitch in the mixer levels when the sound 
module is reloaded. Likewise for warm boots.
This shouldn't all be done in kernel-space, but by passing the initial mixer
levels as arguments to the module, and providing some way of getting them back
to user-space before unloading the module, we should be able to manage it quite
cleanly.
The former is fairly simple. The latter involves some thought - the preremove 
scripts don't get executed for auto-cleaned modules, and having a daemon to 
periodically record the settings will just mean that the module _never_ gets 
unloaded, because it's never idle. Perhaps a printk just before unloading, or 
perhaps the module itself can exec() a process to grab the levels.
