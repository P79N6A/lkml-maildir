What does fbset show?  If the line rgba shows all zero, then you will get a
blank screen. The driver must properly set info->var.green|red|blue|transp,
which in turn depends on the hardware configuration.
You can try to insert these in tgafb_pci_register() after fb_find_mode().
If at 8bpp pseudocolor:
all->info.var.green.length = 8;
all->info.var.red.length = 8;
all->info.var.blue.length = 8;
all->info.var.green.offset = 0;
all->info.var.red.offset = 0;
all->info.var.blue.offset = 0;
If at 32-bit truecolor:
all->info.var.green.length = 8;
all->info.var.red.length = 8;
all->info.var.blue.length = 8;
all->info.var.green.offset = 8;
all->info.var.red.offset = 16;
all->info.var.blue.offset = 0;
If the above changes work, a definitive fix is still needed, one that will
also set the above for each visual the hardware supports on each
fb_check_var().
