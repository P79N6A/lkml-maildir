Unfortunately, it's not.
The block layer just tells us "it's a contiguous run of memory", which 
implies nothing really about the allocation size.
Bart and I (and others?) essentially need a "page+1" thing (for 2.4.x 
too!), that won't break in the face of NUMA/etc.
Alternatively (or additionally), we may need to make sure the block 
layer doesn't merge across zones or NUMA boundaries or whatnot.
