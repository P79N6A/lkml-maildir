That is certainly not what I was proposing.  Why are you bringing
sys/stat.h into this?  The contents of sys/stat.h are entirely up
to SUSv3 and the C library to worry about.  Nobody has proposed
mucking with that.  I dunno about your C library, but mine
doesn't include linux/* header files (not even sys/stat.h).  And
I'd really like to fix uClibc to not use any asm/* either, since
much of it is entirely unsuitable for user space.
I am proposing a single consistant policy for all of linux/* such
that all linux/* headers that need integer types of a specific
size shall #include unistd.h and use ISO C99 types rather that
the ad-hoc kernel types they now use.
The policy has _long_ been that user space must never include
linux/* header files.  Since we are now proposing a project to
reverse this policy, the long standing policy making linux/*
verboten now leaves us completely free to do pretty much anything
with linux/*.  And what I want is for linux/* to use the shiny
ISO C99 types.
