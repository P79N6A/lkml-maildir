That'll turn this URL: 
 
http://git.infradead.org/?p=users/dwmw2/killconfig.h.git
into
 
http://git.infradead.org/?p=users/dwmw2/killconfig.h.git/git_redirect
It's going to be easier to do the gitweb side if we change it to append
';a=git_redirect' instead. In fact, we could probably make the
conditional on the URL containing a ?p= argument which makes it
(reasonably) obvious that it's a gitweb URL, and _replace_ any 'a='
argument in the URL rather than just appending it naïvely.
I'll play with that later this evening.
