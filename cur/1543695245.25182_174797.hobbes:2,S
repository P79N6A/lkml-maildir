I tried to reproduce this error last night using the scsi_debug driver,
but could not. I tried different combinations of file systems (fat, ext2,
ext3). I did notice that I had elevator=deadline on the cmdline. I
removed this in case the elevator_queue_empty_fn between the two
elevators made a difference. I still was unable to reproduce. I will try
a few more combinations of things this weekend and let you know what I
find out. There might be a race still with our cleanups and I am not
able to reproduce it exactly on my system.
