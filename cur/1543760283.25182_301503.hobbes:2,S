The codepaths are indeed longer in 2.6.

hm, that's not a lot.
Once you redo that patch to use aops and to work with O_DIRECT, the paths
will get a little deeper, but not much.  We really should do this so that
O_DIRECT works, and in case someone has gone and mmapped the blockdev.
Fine-grained alignment is probably too hard, and it should fall back to
__blockdev_direct_IO().
Does it do the right thing with a request which is non-page-aligned, but
512-byte aligned?
readv and writev?
2% is pretty thin :(

General cache replacement, perhaps.  9MB is a big cache though.

OK.  Seems that the 2.4 O(1) scheduler got it right for that machine.

Maybe there are other factors which drown these little things out:
architecture improvements, choice of architecture, driver changes, etc.
