Subject: [I4L] dc_l1_init() double WORK_INIT kills off keyboard

Salut,
Sometimes, dc_l1_init is called  on an already initialized card state.
That wouldn't  be too  bad if there  just wasn't that  workqueue entry
which is  going loopy  then. This workqueue  entry will  have (amongst
others) the effect that no keyboard input will be accepted.
The fix here is to skip the work initialization if the work is already
in the work queue.
