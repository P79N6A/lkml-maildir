Not just in theory, I get notes from people saying they use addir for 
backups, which is why I wrote it, because I change ~50MB/day and one CD 
will hold all the change. So addir is like growisofs with some 
additional bells and whistles I found useful, like taking a list of 
files changed taoday from stdin (find) and adding them to the end of the 
CD, preserving or renaming directory names, etc.

 if you want to see an example.
I used the mixed audio and data a few times, I'm sure there are folks 
who use it regularly. cdrecord is full function, and continues to 
support new vendors and models, work around firmware bugs etc. A real 
replacement is going to be a lot of ongoing work.
