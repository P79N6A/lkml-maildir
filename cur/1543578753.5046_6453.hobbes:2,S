configuration lost - probably a VIA686a.
Jan 13 01:58:17 iq kernel: probable hardware bug: restoring chip
configuration.
I get these, do not know why. MB is abit BH6, IDE controllers are the
onboard and a WinFast CMD648.
Have never seen such before (2.0.x and 2.2.x up till now).
Bug rather in SW maybe?
