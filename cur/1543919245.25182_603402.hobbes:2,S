Hi Linus et al.,
2.6.23 does not build with my usual .config on x86_64 and gcc-4.2.1:
In file included from fs/drop_caches.c:8:
include/linux/mm.h:1210: warning: 'struct super_block' declared inside parameter list
nclude/linux/mm.h:1210: warning: its scope is only this definition or declaration, which is probably not what you want
fs/drop_caches.c:17: error: conflicting types for 'drop_pagecache_sb'
include/linux/mm.h:1210: error: previous declaration of 'drop_pagecache_sb' was here
fs/drop_caches.c:28: error: conflicting types for 'drop_pagecache_sb'
include/linux/mm.h:1210: error: previous declaration of 'drop_pagecache_sb' was here
A little forward declaration fixes this:

+++ linux-2.6.23/include/linux/mm.h	2007-10-10 09:30:23.000000000 +0200

You probably end up fixing it some other way, but as I do not know this
file inside out I just wanted to drop a note.
Yours,
