In this case you might want to know that ROCK Linux is not yet another
distribution but a distribution build kit including and build system
to rebuild the whole distribution in a sorted and clean manner.
And no, it is not like Gentoo where you need to rebuild on each box or
so.

Well, as I mentioned there is not much ROCK Linux specific in ROCK
Linux. Mostly it consists of this auto build system including a huge
set (1200 at the moment) package descriptions allowing convenient
single package or whole system (re-)builds.
