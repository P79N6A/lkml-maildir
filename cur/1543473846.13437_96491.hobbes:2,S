Roger that. And I killed the comment, it was originally just a 'local
tree' kinda thing -- I really meant to get rid of it before I sent it :)
Patch attached.
	o	Adds a QuickStart to oops-tracing.txt
	o	Informative first line to oops dumps. 
Linus, 
	While we're on the topic of oopsen, I have to ask about ksymoops.
	Is the C++ version going to remain in the kernel, or ...
	<hint>
	Is Keith Owens' <kaos@ocs.com.au> new version going to be magically
	included in 2.2?
	</hint>
Having to keep g++ around just to compile ksymoops is a bummer, and
Keith's new C version has a bunch of nifty (read: needed) features.
Works wonderfully here.
Latest version is at <
ftp://ftp.ocs.com.au/pub/ksymoops.tar.gz>.

+QuickStart: If you simply want to report an oops, just do:
+
+      cd /usr/src/linux/scripts
+      g++ -o ksymoops ksymoops.cc
+      ./ksymoops ../System.map < the_oops.txt

+And send the output to linux-kernel@vger.rutgers.edu, with a small
+description how this happened. (but send it even if you know nothing about
