Maybe it would make more sense to have CONFIG_MEMPOOL=n just remove
the mempool API entirely and have it imply CONFIG_BLOCK=n, CONFIG_NFS_FS=n,
and CONFIG_NFSD=n?  Just a thought.
It seems like a reasonalbe thing to omit for some tiny configs that don't
need it, but if the API is provided it should probably work as expected.
