I'd have proposed the same, before reading further down in the patch.
Basically, the driver is full of duplication, so the exact same struct
can be used several times.  Therefore, the downsides of your approach
seem to prevail.

Yup.  There are thousands of detail to improve in that driver.  It's
current maintainership (there is none) may explain that state.
