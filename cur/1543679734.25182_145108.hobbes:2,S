Hi,
Here are some pnp related fixes.  The main focus of this release
is to fix disabled resource handling.  Also included is an
important bug fix for manual resource setting (used by ALSA
drivers).
Please Pull from: bk://linux-pnp.bkbits.net/pnp-2.5
Thanks,
Adam

  [PNP] Handle Disabled Resources Properly
  Some devices will allow for individual resources to be disabled,
  even when the device as a whole is active.  The current PnP
  resource manager is not handling this situation properly.  This
  patch corrects the issue by detecting disabled resources and then
  flagging them. The pnp layer will now skip over any disabled
  resources.  Interface updates have also been included so that we
  can properly display resource tables when a resource is disabled.
  Also note that a new flag "IORESOURCE_DISABLED" has been added to
  linux/ioports.h.
