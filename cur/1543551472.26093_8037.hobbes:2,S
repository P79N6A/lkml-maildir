I'm not familiar with yenta controllers/devices,
and I'm not trying to throw you a tasty red herring,
but...
yenta_config_init() does
    config_writeb(socket, PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE, 32);
Is this writing to the CardBus bridge or to the device's
CacheLineSize register?
If the latter, and given that PCI_CACHE_LINE_SIZE is in
units of 4-byte "words", is 32 [= 128 bytes] a good value
to use?  If so, why?
Or is it OK because it is setting a PCI bridge device's
cache line size?
From TI's PCI1451 GJG CardBus controller spec:
4.8 Cache Line Size Register
The cache line size register is programmed by host software to indicate
the system cache line size.
Thanks,
~Randy
