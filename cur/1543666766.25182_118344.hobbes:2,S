You want uClinux, 
http://www.uclinux.org
.

Allmost all Palm's use a Motorola 68k varient (either
68328, 68EZ328 or 68VZ328). These have no MMU.

Nope. That is what uClinux is all about. Running Linux without
an MMU. We have been doing it for years. First supported on
kernels in the linux-2.0.x range. Most people using 2.4.x these
days, or now uClinux is part of standard linux, it is in all
the latest 2.5.x kernels.

Well this is most certainly wrong. uClinux is free. It is just
a set of patches against standard linux kernels, so it is,
offcourse, covered by the GPL. You can get all the code at
www.uclinux.org or under cvs at cvs.uclinux.org
Lots of MMUless processors support, including Motorola 68000/683xx
and ColdFire varients, ARM7TDMI cores (from Atmel, Conexant, Samsung,
NetSilicon, etc), NEC v850, Sparc LEON, Intel i960, Hitachi H8/300,
MIPS (MMUless varients, for example from Brecis), FPGA soft cores
(like Altera NIOS, OpenCores OpenRISC, etc).
Regards
Greg
