I suppose that you mean that the application has properly set up the 
port using termios/tcsetattr/ioctl and the like... rather than if the 
kernel build/config options were set to permit flow control (I know of 
no relevant flow-control-enabling kernel build options).  Using hardware 
flow control this is what stty tells me about the port set up done by 
the application:
# stty -F /dev/ttyS1 -a
speed 115200 baud; rows 0; columns 0; line = 0;
intr = ^C; quit = ^\; erase = ^?; kill = ^U; eof = ^D; eol = <undef>; 
eol2 = <undef>; start = ^Q; stop = ^S; susp = ^Z; rprnt = ^R; werase = 
^W; lnext = ^V; flush = ^O;
min = 1; time = 0;

They seem correct to me, but I am certainly willing to be wrong.

I don't know how to verify directly that the board manufacturer wired 
the serial port correctly.  I've tested this on two different 
motherboards made several years apart (but, yes, both were made by the 
same manufacturer).  However, when using RedHat 6.0 (kernel 2.2.5) I 
have no problems with data corruption occurring in the data coming from 
the DCE.  So that tells me that *something* was working before that 
isn't working now... and I'm trying to determine what the difference 
is... whether it be a problem in modern kernels or whether it be 
something that the application (HylaFAX) is not doing to accomodate 
whatever changes occurred in modern kernels.
A quick google on "input overrun(s)" may lend some credence (although, 
certainly this is not in any way conclusive) that I'm not the only one 
who may be seeking a solution on this matter.
