No, running at slower speeds (50Mbps), the packet count was well over
4 billion (ie it successfully wrapped 32-bits).  At higher speeds, it
crashes before the 32-bit wrap, generally.  It also does not coorelate
to bytes-sent/received, or anything else that I could think of to look at.

As Dave mentioned, tg3 locks up almost immediately (like within 30 seconds),
and in the meantime, it's spitting out errors that are 'impossible'.  The
messages I sent a day or two ago.
I may have cooked my cards, or something like that, because one of
the tg3's do not work in my other machine now.  Still trouble-shooting that one.
