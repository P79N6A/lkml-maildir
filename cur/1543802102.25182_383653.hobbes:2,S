Martin,
I appologize for using the phrase "completely insane".
The rebase proposal caught me somewhat off-guard and
I was expressing surprise -- hopefully not taken as insult.
Further, I thank you for your thoughful follow-up.
While I don't expect it to become a routine occurnece for me,
I do see that rebase has utility in some situations.
