Only as far as "traditional TOE" is concerned. My idea is
precisely to avoid treating TOE as a special case.

For a start, that may be good enough, even though you miss
a lot of nice hardware optimizations.

You've got a point there. The question is whether these
interface really cover everything we need, and - more
importantly - whether they still have the same semantics.

Clusters are nice, but they don't help if your bottleneck
is per-packet processing overhead with a single NIC, or if
you can't properly distribute the applications.
I'm not saying that TOE, even if done in a maintainable way,
is always the right approach. E.g. if all you need is a fast
path to main memory, Dave's flow cache would be a much
cheaper solution. If you can distribute the workload, and
the extra hardware doesn't bother you, your clusters become
attractive.
