be sure to watch the -mm tree as well, a lot of patches are picked up by Andrew 
to be fed to Linus that way
this is a particularly bad week since almost all the core developers were up at 
OLS.
one thing you may want to look at doing (hosting permitting) is to setup a git 
tree to just hold your trivial patches so that they can be pulled easily.
I thought there was a person who was maintaining a -trivial tree for this 
purpose, I don't remember who it was though.
