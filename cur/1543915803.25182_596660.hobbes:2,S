Hello,
in my Thinkpad T61 there is another Hitachi harddisk with NCQ problems
(spurious completions during NCQ...).
Model number: HITACHI HTS541612J9SA00
Serial number: SBDIC7JP
Adding the line
{ "HITACHI HTS541612J9SA00", "SBDIC7JP", ATA_HORKAGE_NONCQ, },
to the ata_device_blacklist in libata-core.c fixes the problem for me.
Cheers,
Peter
