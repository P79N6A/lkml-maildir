     Noone _on the linux kernel mailing list_ cares, you mean.
     And guess what?  That's not true;  two people have already popped
     up and complained about it.
     Sure, you can do things the MS-Windows way and arbitrarily break
     compatability from one version of Linux to the next (certainly this
     would be nothing new -- software engineering died of a buzzword
     overdose early in the 1990s -- but it would be nice to be able to
     recommend Linux in terms more glowing than "well, it's Unix, I
     guess.")
     So CR/LF is a horrible hack that should never have been done in
     the first place.  Good, it's a better lesson to kernel developers
     that when you design a published interface you need to do it well
     or else it will haunt you forever.

                    \/      every six months, the mythical TCO is gonna start
