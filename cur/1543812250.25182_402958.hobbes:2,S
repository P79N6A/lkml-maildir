Boy, lots of reiserfs things happening lately.
We presently have:
reiserfs-do-not-check-if-unsigned-0.patch	[ merged today ]
reiserfs-fix-transaction-overflowing.patch
reiserfs-handle-trans_id-overflow.patch
reiserfs-reiserfs_file_write-will-lose-error-code-when-a-0-length-write-occurs-w-o_sync.patch
reiserfs-cleanups.patch
reiserfs-use-balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited_nr-in-reiserfs_file_write.patch
reiserfs-fix-unaligned-bitmap-usage.patch
The question is, which of these are sufficiently serious-and-safe for
2.6.16?
I haven't seen any resierfs bug reports for quite some time (except for the
usual dribble of it-goes-oops-in-prints.c-when-something-went-wrong
reports).
So I'm inclined to hold off on all the above?
