No, this is in ip_options_compile() which from what I can see is only
called by ip_rcv() (ip_input.c) which kfrees the same skb if
ip_options_compile returns an error: 
        if (ip_options_compile(NULL, skb))
            goto inhdr_error;
...
inhdr_error:
    ip_statistics.IpInHdrErrors++;
drop:
        kfree_skb(skb);
        return(0);
So it was a double-free if an error occurred in this case.
