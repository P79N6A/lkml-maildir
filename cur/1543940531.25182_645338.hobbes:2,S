actually get_user_pages doesn't fault either but it calls into
set_page_dirty, however get_user_pages (unlike a userland-write) at
least requires mmap_sem in read mode and the PT lock as serialization,
userland writes don't, they just go ahead and mark the pte in hardware
w/o faults. Anyway anonymous memory these days always mapped with
dirty bit set regardless, even for read-faults, after Nick finally
rightfully cleaned up the zero-page trick.
