Using SuSE 9.1 Professional with kernel 2.6.11  running on a AOpen 1845
Laptop.
Currently running without APM & ACPI
If I turn either or both on I get an erratic mouse and entries such as
these:
Mar  3 15:06:55 bventer01 kernel: psmouse.c: Mouse at
isa0060/serio2/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
Mar  3 15:07:23 bventer01 kernel: psmouse.c: Mouse at
isa0060/serio2/input0 lost synchronization, throwing 2 bytes away.
Kernels 2.6.x all reproduce the above symptoms.  I'm currently running
on 2.6.11
Must say that the occurance of these erratic problems are a lot less in
2.6.11 but they still persist.  I did do a test to see if it was ACPI
related.
With ACPI and APM turned on and when I restart "powersaved" mouse goes
crazy without me touching it.  I'm not too sure how to progress to
locate/fix this problem.
Tnx & Bi
