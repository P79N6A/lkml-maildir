I feel that presence on the lru list should contribute to
page->count.  It seems a bit weird and kludgy that this
is not so.
If we were to do this then would this not fix networking's
problem?  The skb free wouldn't release the page - it would
be left on the LRU with ->count == 1 and kswapd would reap it.
