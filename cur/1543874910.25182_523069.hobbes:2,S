If I set /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio to "5" the write lockup happens within
the first MilliSecond, at about 100MB per file system.
If I slew the dirty_ratio to 80, the lockup happens
at about 2GB per file system.
2.6.21-rc4 has the same symptoms, and same lockups.
It appears that mptsas is dropping something.
