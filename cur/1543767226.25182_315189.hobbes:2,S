Not that you want to hear it, but I have a T42p (that I just got a few
weeks ago) and it can do S3 suspend/resume just fine.
There are 3 things you need to do: 
boot with: "acpi_sleep=s3_bios"
rmmod all the usb modules before suspending. 
do not use the binary only ati drivers. 
I use the hibernate script from the suspend2 project: 
http://suspend2.net/
set to do S3 instead of suspend2, which also unloads blacklisted
modules (Including the usb ones) and re-loads them on resume. 
You might try that if you get a chance. ACPI has come a long way...
