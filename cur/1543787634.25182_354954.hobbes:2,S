I have, by example and by spec.  They both use two different
and distinct architectures.
Now _you_ have decided that this isn't the case, simply because
you want to prove your own idea.  (which breaks SAM layering)
I think I explained the similarity of the SAS Transport Layer
to *USB and SBP*.
As I said: everyone wants a pice of the SAS code.
You do too.
I'm sure you'll do whatever humanly possible to show
that _your_ idea can be applied: you can do this now:
just use a big if () { ... } else { ... } statement and
you're done.
Furthermore I do not see the reasons to umbrella both
"aic94xx and LSI cards" when they are _completely different_
in architecture: MPT and open transport (ala USB Storage and SBP).

The code is here:

I just thought it was only fare to the rest of the community
to know how far the politics has escalated.
Everyone wants a piece of the SAS code.
