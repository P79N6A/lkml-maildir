ACK.
How about adding HAS_AGP into platform Kconfig and making that animal
dependent on it?
BTW, AFAICS a legitimate form of negative dependency is && (!FOO || BROKEN)
and it's common enough to consider adding a separate
	broken if <expression>
to config language.  It would be interpreted as && (!<expr> || BROKEN) added
to dependencies, but would document the situation better.
