Ok, but then we should ask ourselves if it's really worth to have a 
per-CPU pool (that will require quite a few changes to the current way 
of doing things), or a per-process pool (that would basically work as is). 
What advantage gives us a per-CPU pool?
Setup cost? Not really IMO. Thread creation is pretty cheap, and a typical 
process using async will have a pretty huge lifespan (compared to the pool 
creation cost).
Configurability scores for a per-process pool, because it may allow each 
process (eventually) to size his own.
What's the real point in favour of a per-CPU pool, that justify all the 
changes that will have to be done in order to adopt such concept?
