I'm surprised.  ext2's fsync in 2.2 is in fact quite optimal: a single
pass across the block tree, in probable-LBA-order.  No livelock potential
there.  Optimal.  Note that it implements "only sync the stuff which was
dirty on entry" semantics.
But msync() is a different kettle of fish.  It calls file_fsync(), which
syncs the entire device, livelockably.  Are you sure `solid' is not
using msync?
