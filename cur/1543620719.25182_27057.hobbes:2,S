There's something that's still bothering me - I wonder if I'm missing
something very obvious here.

For a caller who just got an exclusive wakeup on the request queue, 
this enables the woken up task to do batching and not sleep again on the 
next request it needs. However since we use the same logic for new callers, 
don't we still have those starvation issues ?
(i.e new callers end up stealing requests while there are sleepers, 
given that wakeups will happen only if the queue builds up beyond the high
water mark)
