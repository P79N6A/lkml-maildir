How long did you let your machine run? In my case, it has to run the
whole night until it happens. I don't know if it helps but I think the
first processes that are in uninterruptible sleep are apache and mysql.
Also, as you can see in my first e-mail (ps -aux output), the pdflush
and kswapd0 are in in uninterruptible sleep state.
