My own system (Dell Latitude CPx750J laptop, RH7.3 base) has 'reboot'
 segfaulting and (thanks to kksymoops :) this info, hand copied from the
 dead monitor:
EFLAGS: 00010286
EIP is at device_shutdown + 0x6d/0xa2
(didn't write registers down - call trace w/o addresses follows)
sys_reboot
handle_mm_fault
do_page_fault
sock_destroy_inode
destroy_inode
dput
__fput
filp_close
sys_close
syscall_call
I can provide further info / try debugging (but I won't necessarily be
 speedy in responding, sorry). This 2.5.44 is built with GCC 3.2.
Thanks,
--alessandro
