Tested with rc5 - same results.  It was suggested that I run slabtop when the system freezed, so
here is that info: (again, by hand, I'm getting another machine to use either netconsole or a
serial cable).
 Active / Total Objects (% used)    : 478764 / 485383 (98.6%)
 Active / Total Slabs (% used)      : 14618 / 14635 (99.9%)
 Active / Total Caches (% used)     : 79 / 138 (57.2%)
 Active / Total Size (% used)       : 56663.79K / 57566.41K (98.4%)
 Minimum / Average / Maximum Object : 0.01K / 0.12K / 128.00K
  OBJS ACTIVE  USE OBJ SIZE  SLABS OBJ/SLAB CACHE SIZE NAME                   
403088 403088 100%    0.06K   6832       59     27328K nfs_page
 30380  30380 100%    0.50K   4340        7     17360K nfs_write_data
 15134  15134 100%    0.27K   1081       14      4324K radix_tree_node
...
The other thing is that the stack trace showsd slabtop as being halted in throttle_vm_writeout
while allocating memory, and the writetest was halted waiting to allocate memory.
I'll get more detailed stack traces once I get the second machine set up.
