Doesn't my reply explain the actual problem? The code path being;
arch/i386/kernel/apm.c
suspend()
	write_seqlock_irq(xtime_lock)
	...
	write_sequnlock_irq(xtime_lock)
	<interrupts enabled>
	device_power_up()
		timer_resume()
			get_cmos_time();
So this covers the problem that the reporter reported, so yes it's setting 
xtime but we shouldn't be taking interrupts in the first place, so i 
posted the patch to cover that. APM was clearly violating PM resume 
procedures.
Thanks,
