OK, it turns out the problem was with running SATA drive in AHCI mode.
After applying the following patch from Forrest Zhao
http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/7/20/56
both suspend to disk and suspend to ram work fine now.
This patch is going into 2.6.18, isn't it?
Huge thanks to Thomas Glanzman for help in tracking this down.
You rock.
