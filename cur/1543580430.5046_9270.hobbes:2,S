	We experience trouble with the Promise (PDC20265) IDE controller

	Linux 2.4.1 fails to detect correct geometry for the four last
	disks (identified as hde, hdf, hdg, hdh).
But there is no indication of what the problems could be,
or what he thinks the geometry should be (and why).
I see nothing very wrong in the posted data.

[Don't forget: (i) geometry does not exist (ii) hdparm is just
some user program.]
