The d_path changes for absolute path mediation for chroot are not yet in any 
SuSE release. Nor are they reflected in any developed profiles (yet).
Another direction is a new security_chroot hook together with appropriate 
CLONE_FS tracking (inside AppArmor) to force chrooting confined tasks into a 
subprofile (similar to change hat). We are evaluating the options based on 
feedback here and from other places.  Hence the RFC.
I hope this helps.
