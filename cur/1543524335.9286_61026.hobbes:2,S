I'm hoping to expand on that some time shortly - so that not only is the source
identical, but even the object files are compiled identically whether they're
compiled with -DMODULE or not - and then I'd remove the definition of MODULE
from the Makefiles.
In conjunction with Willy's Non-Recursive Make patches, I expect this to 
dramatically simplify the kernel build process.
I also have my eye on Erich Boleyn's Proposed 'Multiboot Standard', in 
particular the loading of modules at boot time.
