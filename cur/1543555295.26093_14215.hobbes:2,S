 But this message is printed when a workaround for certain early SMP EISA
boards gets activated.  You shouldn't normally get it for anything newer
than P5/66 unless your MP-table is broken.  Can you send me a dump of your
MP-table (just issue `dmesg -s 32768' after a bootstrap -- the table is at
the top).

 Well, in this specific configuration, it may be either the 8254 timer or
the 8259 legacy PIC as when the workaround gets activated both timer IRQs
and NMIs go through the latter.  It is certainly possible to reprogram
the chips but maybe we can find a way to avoid the lockup.
