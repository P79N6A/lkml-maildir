Hi,
Yesterday I reported a problem compiling with SMP enabled for an
Athlon-targetted kernel.  I wonder whether this is because there
are no Athlon SMP systems out there, yet? If so, then if the
architecture selected is Athlon, the SMP option should not be
available when configuring the kernel tree.  If there are SMP
Athlon machines, would someone please follow up on this compile
error?
Thanks,
Miles
