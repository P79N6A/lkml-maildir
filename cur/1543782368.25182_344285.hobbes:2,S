While sequence points are relevant for purposes of reasoning about the
effects of C code on the abstract state machine as defined by the C
standard, they are irrelevant when talking about IO.

The first register write will be completed before the second register
write because you use writel, which is defined to have the semantics you
want.  (It uses a platform-specific method to guarantee this, possibly
"volatile" or "asm("eieio")" or whatever method your platform requires.)
The sequence points, by themselves, do not make any requirements on the
externally visible behavior of the program.  Nor does the fact that
there's an inline function involved.  It's just the writel() that
contains the magic to force in-order execution.
You might benefit by running your source code through gcc -E and seeing
what the writel() expands to.  (I do something like "rm drivers/mydev.o;
make V=1" and then copy-n-paste the gcc line, replacing the "-c -o mydev.o"
options with -E.)
The sequence point argument is obviously wrong, BTW - if it were the
case that a mere sequence point required the compiler to have completed
all externally-visible side effects, then almost every optimization that
gcc does with -O2 would be impossible.  CSE, loop splitting, etc.
