I may be missing something, I'm all for the ability to have threads with
their own fd namespace, but will NPTL/Linux retain the capability to pass
fd's to other threads?
One thing I've used in tens of programs is:
void *session(void *p)
{
	int fd=(int)p;
	...
}
...
for(;;) {
	fd=accept();
	pthread_create_thread(session,(void*)fd);
}
I'd like to continue to have that ability.
Thanks.
