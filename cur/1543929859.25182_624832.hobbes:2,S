Hi,
Here is the architecture dependent instrumentation for LTTng. Not all
architectures are supported, and some of them have missing instrumentation
points.
The most complete should be :
x86_32, x86_64, powerpc, mips and arm.
It depends on the kernel trace thread flag patchset.
It instruments :
- traps/faults
- system calls
- kernel thread creation
- IPC calls
