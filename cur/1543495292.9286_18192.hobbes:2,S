Hi,
my scheduler patch seems to contain a weird bug that
makes your machine hang somewhere halfway booting,
so DON'T FRIGGIN USE IT :)
I know what it is (in reschedule_idle the goodness of
the idle task is near-infinite), but the 'original'
scheduler of 2.2.8 performs so good that I don't
really care anymore.
When people really bug me for a larger difference
between nice levels or if removal of the process
recalculation ritual is wanted, I'll start working
on the scheduler again. In the meantime, try out
2.2.8-preX and tell Mingo how much you like it...
cheers,
