No, it does not.  I've even added printks here and there to show node number,
and everything works as it should.  Maybe there are some problems with
numa_node_id() and migrating between processors when memory gets released,
I do not know.
Only thing I know that if I'll add WARN_ON below to the free_block(), it
triggers...
@free_block
   slabp = GET_PAGE_SLAB(virt_to_page(objp));
   nodeid = slabp->nodeid;
+  WARN_ON(nodeid != numa_node_id());             <<<<<
   l3 = cachep->nodelist[nodeid];
   list_del(&slabp->list);
   objnr = (objp - slabp->s_mem) / cachep->objsize;
   check_spinlock_acquired_node(cachep, nodeid);
   check_slabp(cachep, slabp);
... saying that keventd/0 tries to operate on
slab belonging to node#1, while having acquired lock for cachep belonging
to node #0.  Due to this check_spinlock_acquired_node(cachep, nodeid) fails
(check_spinlock_acquired_node(cachep, 0) would succeed).
