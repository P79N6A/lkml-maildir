Hello,
please CC me on any replies to this message since I'm not subscribed to the
list (just toooo much mail for me)
I have a very simple question:
I used to compile-in my framebuffer-device in the kernel
then i just appended "video=tdfxfb:1024x768-32@70" in lilo.conf and it
worked..
now i compiled it as a module, and want modprobe to start it up for me..
how can this be done?
modprobe tdfxfb 1024x768-32@70
won't work, because there is no '=' sign in it so modprobe doesn't recognize
it as a parameter, and doesn't pass it.
so what can i do about it?
tnx in advance :)
