I hear Ingo is off having a genuine long weekend, but in the meantime,
you could try echo 30 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_features to eliminate the
sleeper fairness changes in v19, since that was the biggest change.
Sending a few seconds of logged /proc/sched_debug will also help get a
picture of what's happening, and lovely would be a method to reproduce
the problem locally.
