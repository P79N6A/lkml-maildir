Hey, I still have 8-bit isa scsi card somewhere.... Last time I fixed
that was just before 2.4 because that was when I got it... Don't flush
drivers too fast, please... If you kill drivers during 2.5, people
will not notice, and even interesting drivers will get killed. Killing
them during 2.6.2 might be better.
