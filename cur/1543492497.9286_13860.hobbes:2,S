Hi all,
I've been working on autofs lately to add some features, most notably the
ability to automount whole trees of filesystems, including constructing
skeleton directory trees for mountpoints if necessary.  There's a demonstration
of how to do Solaris-like nfs automounting in samples/auto.net.
I've also cleaned things up, like using dentries directly in the autofs
filesystem for keeping state.
I have a set of patches for the kernel code (ver 2.2.5) and for the daemon
(against 3.1.3).  Patches and a more detailed description of my changes are
available at 
http://www.goop.org/~jeremy/autofs.html.
I've been using this code for a while now and it seems stable, but it is quite
new so there could still be problems.  Tell me how it works for you, bug
reports, comments, suggestions, etc.
