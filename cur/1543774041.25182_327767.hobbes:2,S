my 'dohell' script is embarrasingly simple:
 while true; do dd if=/dev/zero of=bigfile bs=1024000 count=1024; done &
 while true; do killall hackbench; sleep 5; done &
 while true; do ./hackbench 20; done &
 ( cd ltp-full-20040707; su mingo -c ./run40; ) &
 ping -l 100000 -q -s 10 -f v &
 du / &
 ./dortc &
and i also start a preloaded flood-ping externally. ./dortc does:
 chrt -f 98 -p `pidof 'IRQ 8'`
 cd rtc_wakeup
 ./rtc_wakeup -f 8192 -t 100000
and ./run40 does:
 while true; do ./runalltests.sh -x 40; done
it's not rocket science - i'm just starting a sensible mix of latency 
generators, without letting any of them dominate the landscape.

see above. (It's no secret, i described components of this workload in 
one of my first mails to the adeos thread. Btw., what happened to adeos 
irq latency testing?)
