Some of this discussion is a little bit unfair. My understanding of what
Intel has done with the P4, is create an architecture that allows for
higher clock rates. Sure the P4 might take 84, vs PII 34, but how many
PII 2.4 Ghz machines have you ever seen on the market?
Certainly, some of their decisions seem to be a little odd on the surface.
That doesn't mean the situation is black and white.
