Sorry about not responding sooner. I've been a bit swamped.

I take it these cards do not reply to CMD2?

This change is ok right now, but might come back to bite us in the
future if we implement more intelligent voltage selection (right now new
cards will have to make due with what's already selected).
If we check cards on both sides of mmc_setup(), then we should be covered.
Also, please add some comments about why we do this. Otherwise it will
run the risk of getting removed in the future.
