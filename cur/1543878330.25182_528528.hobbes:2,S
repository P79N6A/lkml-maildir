I'm not convinced.  Let's dispell the myth that this reduces memory usage.
Two configurations used (see below for their details):
[1]:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  10868     268       0   11136    2b80 unpatched/fs/partitions/built-in.o
  11260     228       0   11488    2ce0 patched/fs/partitions/built-in.o
[2]:
   7336     248       0    7584    1da0 unpatched/fs/partitions/built-in.o
   7668     228       0    7896    1ed8 patched/fs/partitions/built-in.o
It quite clearly has an average 330-ish byte cost increase rather than a
reduction.  That's quite obvious since instead of interating over data,
we're linearly executing effectively unrolled code which just repeats the
same operations time and time again, the only difference being that you're
calling some other function.
I'm also unconvinced that an array of function pointers is any harder to
read than open coding a list of calls.  In terms of clutter I'd say the
latter was worse.
Finally note that the following fix has been committed to mainline,
which requires the corresponding fix in your patch.  See commit ID
9bebff6ca5871e07b665cdaf71028ea21eb0bf0e for the full info.
