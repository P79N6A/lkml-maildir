Hello,
Just a heads up on this problem I sent a few days ago:
> Testing 2.6.29-rc2-git1, I notice something which doesn't happen with

The problem is still present in 2.6.29-rc2-git3 on this P4 machine, but
I do not see it on a Centrino laptop.
Config has not changed and I do not know if /proc/interrupts is useful
or not so I am not attaching anything for now, feel free to ask for more
information and I will do my best to provide it. I know someone else
also experienced this problem on his machines.
