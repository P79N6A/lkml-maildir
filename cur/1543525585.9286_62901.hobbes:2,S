If these were produce 'en mass (which I think is what Larry is
suggesting), then I don't see why it isn't possible.
I don't think anyone reasonable expects to get a smart appliance with
256M of ram and PIII-733 performance for that kind of money, but I
don't wee why fast 486/Pentium speed with 8/16M of memory isn't
possible... and thanks to Moore's Law, this will change.
