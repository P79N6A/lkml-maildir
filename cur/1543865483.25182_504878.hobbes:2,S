argh.  We just can't go adding all this gunk into the write() path. 
mmap_sem, a full pte-walk, taking of pte-page locks, etc.  For every page. 
Even single-process write() will suffer, let along multithreaded stuff,
where mmap_sem contention may be the bigger problem.
I was going to do some quick measurements of this, but the code oopses
on power4 (
http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/s5000402.jpg
)
There's a build error in filemap_xip.c btw.
We need to think different.
What happened to the idea of doing an atomic copy into the non-uptodate
page and handling it somehow?
Another option might be to effectively pin the whole mm during the copy:
	down_read(&current->mm->unpaging_lock);
	get_user(addr);		/* Fault the page in */
	...
	copy_from_user()
	up_read(&current->mm->unpaging_lock);
then, anyone who wants to unmap pages from this mm requires
write_lock(unpaging_lock).  So we know the results of that get_user()
cannot be undone.
Or perhaps something like this can be done on a per-vma basis.  Just
something to tell the VM "hey, you're not allowed to unmap this page right
now"?
