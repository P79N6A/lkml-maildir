Oh, of *course*. We add interfaces and then claim years later,
after code has been written, "Oh, you shouldn't be using that!" in
documentation. Meanwhile, such code using the old interface will still
a) continue to compile b) continue to run without any sort of warnings.
If interfaces have to change, so be it. But changing the rules for
using them years after it's implemented and then claiming "you didn't
read the instructions" is pretty lame.
