It does 8) You plug it into the network, you select the defaults in the
installation menu, you run mozilla and up comes a web site. Anything beyond
that is not non-expert.
If you want to go into the innards of the routing/arp stuff you might want
to move this to netdev@oss.sgi.com - thats the network folks list and many
of them don't read linux-kernel.
