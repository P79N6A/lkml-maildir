I am (and some of my friends are) still interested in this functionality, so 
I'm definitly going to test your improved patch, of course. By the way, I'm 
quite happy that you came up with this new version of swap-prefetching, 
because I didn't and still don't have the time to develop or maintain it 
more...
So thanks for your good work, and keep on helping Linux-Desktop-Users! :-)
