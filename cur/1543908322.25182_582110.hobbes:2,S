NO for two reasons:
  - atime semantics are just fine in server environments
  - inotify IS NOT scalable to millions of files, nor
    to situations where we want to check alteration weeks
    or months after the fact
In reality I would perhaps prefer mount-behaviour being altered
from 'by default do atime' to 'by default do noatime.
There MUST be an easy way to tell system that "yes, I want to track
last accesstime."
I did recently an embedded Linux PC system where the entire
system disk is a single Compact Flash -card.  I tried to play
with  noatime  option, but the system still kept writing things,
and thus I had to do full and somewhat drastic  read-only.
