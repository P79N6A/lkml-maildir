Is this particular kernel lock helps anyway? We could have been half way
through remove_proc_entry(), line 569, for example, while in the same time
another thread enters de_put when the use count is 1 and frees the entry
while the other thread is locked just before dereferencing the entry.
So, maybe a spinlock could be used here?
