Are you referring to the pci_unmap part ?
There is a 1:1 correspondance between a Tx descriptor entry and
{an unfragmented skb or a fragment of a skb}. Afaiks rtl8169_unmap_tx_skb()
is issued for each Tx descriptor entry, be it after a Tx completion irq or
a general Tx ring cleanup.
I'll read it again after some sleep but the leak does not seem clear to me.
