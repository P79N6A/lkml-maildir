Distributed storage.
I'm pleased to announce the 8'th release of the distributed
storage subsystem (DST). This is a maintenance release and includes
bug fixes only.
DST allows to form a storage on top of local and remote nodes
and combine them into linear or mirroring setup, which in
turn can be exported to remote nodes.
Short changelog:
 * cleanup sysfs files on error path.
	Patch by Chris Madden <chris@reflexsecurity.com>
Overall list of features of the DST can be found on project's homepage:

Thank you.
