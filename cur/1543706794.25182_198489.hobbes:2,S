:)
But seriously, even that is a security issue when someone requests a
URL containing "%00", or some text contains a filename to operate on
and the name contains \0.
For example, if I write a Perl regular expression to reject paths from
the outside world containing "..": m{(?:/|^)\.\.(?:/|\z)}, it will
fail to notice when given the path "..\0" that the kernel will treat
it identically to "..".  Potential security hole, depending on the context.
