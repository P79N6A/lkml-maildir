Um, that should be automatic when USER_PTRS_PER_PGD is increased.
I see the following:
$ grep -n TASK_SIZE include/asm-i386/*.h                 
include/asm-i386/a.out.h:22:#define STACK_TOP   TASK_SIZE
include/asm-i386/elf.h:60:#define ELF_ET_DYN_BASE         (TASK_SIZE / 3 * 2)
include/asm-i386/pgtable.h:68:#define USER_PTRS_PER_PGD (TASK_SIZE/PGDIR_SIZE)
include/asm-i386/processor.h:277:#define TASK_SIZE      (PAGE_OFFSET)
include/asm-i386/processor.h:282:#define TASK_UNMAPPED_BASE     (PAGE_ALIGN(TASK_SIZE / 3))
... which sounds like you need to round up in an overflow-safe fashion
in the macro.
