Subject: IDE Driver in Linux Reports different geometry that Netware during Volume and Partition Create, causing loss of user data under Linux

With a MAXTOR 81750-A4 disk device, Netware reports that this disk device
has a geometry of 850 cylinders, 64 heads, and 63 sectors per track.  Under
Linux, the same device reports a geometry of 780 cylinders, 64 heads, and 63
sectors per track.  If a Netware has partitioned the additional space, then
subsequent attempts to mount any Netware volumes that span beyond the Linux
geometry results in loss of user data.  fdisk sees the additional alloction,
but wont let you allocated beyond the geometry linux reports.  2.2.X reports
the same geometry as 2.0.37.
