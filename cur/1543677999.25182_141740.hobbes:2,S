I haven't seen a clear compiler bug yet, but found two bugs in
assembler code with 2.95.3 that compiled without problems with 3.2.x.
One of them has actually hit people, as you could see in the code.
Most symptoms were "fixed", but the cause remained.
If nothing else, I'd like to keep 2.95 as a code checker for at least
a year or two.  Give 3.x some more time to mature.
