But gconf is not supposed to build with gtk-1.2, it needs 2.x,
at least reding this:
 linux/scripts/kconfig/Makefile:
HOSTLOADLIBES_gconf = `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 gmodule-2.0 libglade-2.0 --libs`
HOSTCFLAGS_gconf.o  = `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 gmodule-2.0 libglade-2.0 --cflags` \
                          -D LKC_DIRECT_LINK
...
# GTK needs some extra effort, too...
$(obj)/.tmp_gtkcheck:
    @if `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 gmodule-2.0 libglade-2.0 --exists`; then       \
        if `pkg-config gtk+-2.0 --atleast-version=2.0.0`; then          \
            touch $@;                               \
        else                                    \
            echo "*";                           \
            echo "* GTK+ is present but version >= 2.0.0 is required."; \
            echo "*";                           \
            false;                              \
        fi                                  \
    else                                        \
        echo "*";                               \
        echo "* Unable to find the GTK+ installation. Please make sure that";   \
        echo "* the GTK+ 2.0 development package is correctly installed...";    \
        echo "* You need gtk+-2.0, glib-2.0 and libglade-2.0.";         \
        echo "*";                               \
        false;                                  \
    fi
endif
I can try just to make it compile, and then polish all the edges...
If you swear to me it does not have to build under gtk-1.2 (which with
current Makefile I do not know how can it be done), there are many stock
things that can be done automagically in 2.x, and not manually like in gtk-1.2.
TIA
