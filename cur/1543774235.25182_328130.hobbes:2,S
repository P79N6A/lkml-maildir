Hi,
We have a need for similar tool so that customers using Linux system can 
report the problem with as much information as they can about their 
system for someone to diagnose the problem efficiently. Customers wanted 
to run this one tool which gathers most useful information for all kinds 
of problems. To help in this process we have a tool developed by local 
university students. I would say the tool is in prototype stage. You can 
download the tool from the project website at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/projectsynfo.
Is the information this tool collects meets the need for what is 
discussed here?
If not what changes you would like to see in the data collected?
Currently the tool is written in "C",  if people don't like this to be 
implemented in "C", please suggest the alternatives and we can make the 
required changes.
Thanks,
Vara Prasad
