I think we need some set of flags for callbacks - where they can be
called, maybe even from which context and so on. So userspace will not
be allowed to create such timers through kevent API.
Will do it for release.

sigev_value was stored in k_itimer structure, I just do not know where
to put it in the ukevent provided to userspace - it can be placed in
pointer value if you like.
