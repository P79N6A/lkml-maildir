Yes, I think you're right about the efficiency.  However, I didn't
think this was a performance-critical code path (especially since it
is only turned on by a debugging config option), and the way I wrote
it matched the way I was thinking about the test ("If the system is
running, then check if we're in atomic or have irqs disabled").
But I don't think it matters much either way.
Thanks,
