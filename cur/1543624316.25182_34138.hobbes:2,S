Your proposal sounds 100% ok to me...
For the details of the userspace interface (for both ATA and SCSI), my 
idea was to use standard read(2) and write(2).
Any number of programs can open /dev/ata/hda/control or 
/dev/scsi/sdc/control.  write(2) submits requests, read(2) consumes 
command responses, perhaps buffering a bit so that multiple responses 
are not lost if userspace is slow.
Maybe it's a cheesy way to avoid ioctl(2), maybe not...
