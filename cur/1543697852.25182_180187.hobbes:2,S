My cat actually goes after my mouse, but boringly only sits on it
and begs for attention. It's sitting on a podium-like contraption
she likes to hop on top of despite the fact it's not a very stable
thing to sit atop. I'll be sure to let gregkh know if she passes any
bugs on to it (it's a USB mouse =).
