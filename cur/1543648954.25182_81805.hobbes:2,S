Subject: [PATCH] 2.5.44 INI-A100U2W compilation fix

In patch-2.5.44 Mike Anderson <andmike@us.ibm.com> made a cleanup to the
Scsi Host setup.
This caused the following errors on trying to compile.
drivers/scsi/inia100.c:98: unknown field `next' specified in initializer
drivers/scsi/inia100.c:98: warning: missing braces around initializer
drivers/scsi/inia100.c:98: warning: (near initialization for `driver_template.shtp_list')
drivers/scsi/inia100.c:98: unknown field `module' specified in initializer
drivers/scsi/inia100.c:98: unknown field `proc_name' specified in initializer
drivers/scsi/inia100.c:98: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
make[2]: *** [drivers/scsi/inia100.o] Error 1
Several of the drivers Mike modified only had the one-line change to remove
the 'next' field.  I tried it and bingo, it works and passed my tests.
The version change is what Doug Ledford intended in patch-2.5.25 back in
June 2002.  (See inia100.c "inia100_Version")
