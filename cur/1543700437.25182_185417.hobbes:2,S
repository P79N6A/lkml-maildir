I figured it would be.

Is it possible to set the limit somewhere between the default and
complete serialization?  Shouldn't it be possible to detect such

The disks will easily do 40 MB/s on a good IDE controller.  It seems
like a rather bad bridge to me if it has that much overhead.  I
haven't seen many different options for sale, either.
