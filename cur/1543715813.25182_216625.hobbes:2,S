Len,
I don't think that the CPU model has much to do with anything, it is
pretty much chipset related. My last remark about buying you a mobo for
debugging purposes was a vain attempt at humor.
I'm just surprised of the lack of support the vendors and NVIDIA/AMD are
giving. I realise that Linux may be only a marginal part of the market for
those companies so it is not commercially justifiable to invest a lot of
time in this.
We all appreciate whatever input you may have, because a solution without
indepth knowledge of how ACPI/APIC code handles stuff is probably needed
to tackle this issue.
All I can do is gather info, and I'm currently thinking of a plan to get
the info we need.
Regards,
Arjen
