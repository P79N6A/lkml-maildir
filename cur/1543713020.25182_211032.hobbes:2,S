cool; linux can use a GPL driver for such things...
[jinum] guess the question/clarification is not clear!
This is a driver for our own controller (PCI). Which is a PCI based
card.
This card is not based on the SCSI or IDE interface so how will some
other driver work for it unless we write ( or get it written sharing our
hardware spec) a driver for the interface?
