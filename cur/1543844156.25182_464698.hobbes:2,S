Sure, thats the big goal for all scsi drivers,but I decided to do one step after another.
I think it would be better to remove Scsi_Cmnd first to remove drivers/scsi/scsi_typedefs.h
first and then make the drivers use the headers in include/scsi/.
This is imho clearer to have one target per patch.
1. -	change Scsi_Cmnd to struct scsi_cmnd
	remove scsi_typedefs.h from drivers/scsi/scsi.h
	remove scsi_typedefs.h from the tree
2. -	put the local headers into c files if only used
	by the driver itself (maybe delete unneeded prototypes or reorder the functions that no prototypes are needed)
3. -	switch over to include/scsi/
Thats is my opinion.
>Also your mailer unfortunately damages tabs.
No, it doesn't. Even if it thunderbird. :)
ultrastor.h uses 4 spaces as intention and I just forgot to replace the with a tab.
Thanks. 
But I'm still looking for an easy standalone commandline smtp-engine to send my patches. Any suggestions?
Greets,
Henne
