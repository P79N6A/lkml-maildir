Hi,
I'd suspect some sort of PCI problem, especially since you're running a 
K6.  What chipset is your motherboard based on?
I'm running a K6-2 400 on an FIC PA2013 with two PDC20269 controllers 
and my primary drive is a 6Y060L0.  I've had no problem with writes in 
DMA mode locking the system in 2.4.22 or any of the test kernels.  I 
have a 92048D8 that doesn't like UDMA-2 writes, but that won't hang the 
system; it just causes Linux to continually reset the interface until 
the kernel finally disables DMA on the drive.  Oddly, UDMA-1 works fine 
but this is a drive to controller hardware issue and not the drivers 
fault. 
Anyway, since the kernel seems to handle a DMA write gone bad, that 
leads me to believe that this issue is caused by the increased data 
flowing over the PCI bus when using DMA vs using PIO.  I'm not an expert 
though, maybe someone else has an opinion on this?
You might try putting the card in another slot too.  My cards are 
installed in slots 1 & 2 with 2 other PCI cards and an ISA device.  This 
particular motherboard seems to handle a full complement of expansion 
cards without problem, but I remember hearing nightmares about such a 
configuration back when these things were new.
