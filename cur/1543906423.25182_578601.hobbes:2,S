Well, if Carlo is not a Linux Kernel manager this comment of mine is 
inapprobiate. Sorry for that.
Actually when I remind myself of all the responses I got from Ingo I did 
not see anything like that what I have complained about here. I take that 
as something where I can learn something: Not nearly every Linux Kernel 
manager is a mean and unfriendly bastard who accuses everyone who wants 
something merged or has a problem report. ;) (At least Ingo did not 
accuse me for my problem reports. If I ever happen to dig that deeply 
into the kernel or its documentation that I have something to merge 
regarding the scheduler, I can try how he reacts to that...)
