    Let me remind you that the patch was following *your* change in 
handle_fasteoi_irq(). Do not present it as my own invention.

    You do, indeed? :-)

    Yeah, your way was *really* better. :-/

    Exactly. How else do_IRQ() would know the vector?

    eoi() would be a more proper name than ack() then.

    Yes. And my perception from that fragment of RT patch was that fasteoi was 
targeted only at SMP interrupt controllers which like IOAPIC are sensible 
enough to not trouble the other CPUs with an interrupt that's already been 
taken by a certain CPU for handling, i.e. that interrupt being effectively 
masked off until EOI arrives (well, that's so for the level triggered but not 
the edge-triggered IRQs, if I don't mistake), so there's no need for explicit 
masking and at the same time that interrupt isn't hindering the delivery of 
the lower-priority interrupts to any CPU (unlike that would be happening with 
8259)...
    Now it turns out that my understading was wrong, and fasteoi could even 
fit for 8259 (according to Ben)?
