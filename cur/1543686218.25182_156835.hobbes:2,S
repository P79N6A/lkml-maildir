Photoshop 6 (yes, legal owned version) in wine is flawless (as it was 
with 2.6.0-test3)
Galciv plays videos quite smoothly but as soon as I run it it will 
freeze the cursor for 12-15 seconds every half-minute or so even within 
the game itself which is turn-based strategy without a lot of whizbang 
stuff. In the past, the videos would stutter but the game would not 
suffer from more than short pauses now and then.
