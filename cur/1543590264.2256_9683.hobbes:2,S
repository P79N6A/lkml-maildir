Can anybody explain what does "mm: critical shortage of bounce buffers"
mean?
I have a 2xP-III/850 system with 2Gbyte of RAM. I'm trying to run
ImageMagick on this system with quite big files (convert consumes 1+ Gbyte
of RAM). The system crushes immediately with that message in log file and a
whole screen of constantly scrolling allocation failure messages.
Should I change some kernel define to be able to use those 2 Gbytes?
It does crush even when given "mem=960M" boot option. Both 4 and 64 Gbytes
RAM configurations do crush. Work like a charm with high memory disabled.
