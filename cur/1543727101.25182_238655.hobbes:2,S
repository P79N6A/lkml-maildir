Hmmm, good points.  And my "queue of one" idea has the danger
of registering a process that doesn't want the token any more
by the time it's handed off...
Maybe we should use the "time/size" score to influence the
chance that a process gets to try and steal the token, in
effect just modifying the odds.
After all, thrashing should be a relatively rare situation,
so the code should be as low impact as possible...
