Hi,
I took a look at what the clisp package is doing which leads up
to the error condition, and find that it's shm.  The following
testcase is extracted from 'configure', and causes the symptom
to appear reliably (here:).
To create the problem, run while true; do kaboom; done on one
vt, and then try to do pretty much _anything_ on another.
