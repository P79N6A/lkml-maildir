Subject: [PATCH 3 of 4] x86: pud_clear: only reload cr3 if necessary
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2008/2/1/306

Rather than unconditionally reloading cr3, only do so if the pud we're
updating is within the active pgd.
This eliminates TLB flushes most of the time.  The
performance-critical uses of pud_clear are during execve and exit, but
in those cases cr3 is referring to some other pagetable.  The only
other use of pud_clear is during a large (1Gbyte+) munmap, and those
are sufficiently rare that a couple of cr3 reloads won't hurt.
