I have modified the X driver now, so that it doesn't depend on packets
arriving one second after the last event, and so that it uses wall
clock time instead of counting packets. This version therefore works
with an unpatched 2.5.72 kernel. It is available here:
        
http://w1.894.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/index.html
I think the following patch should be applied anyway. It adds a link
to the html page, fixes bogus reset retry logic and fixes a deviation
from the coding style preferred by Linus.
