I'd vote for that, I've seen alot very bad code already within some
subsystems and critical problems which just have been ignored by some
maintainers.
It mostly helps if some volunteers read through existing code and
state out their considerations about implementations which they don't
like.
I just grep'ed some examples I noticed (note I do not want to jump
onto someone's toe here, just give some examples):
(sn9c102_ov7660.c)
...
        err += sn9c102_i2c_write(cam, 0x12, 0x80);
        err += sn9c102_i2c_write(cam, 0x11, 0x09);
        err += sn9c102_i2c_write(cam, 0x00, 0x0A);
        err += sn9c102_i2c_write(cam, 0x01, 0x80);
        err += sn9c102_i2c_write(cam, 0x02, 0x80);
        err += sn9c102_i2c_write(cam, 0x03, 0x00);
... (around 150 lines directly after each other doing such writes and
adding error values to a variable, I don't understand why someone
should add the errors but continue with sending 150 more updates, how
about one write failed but others succeeded for any reason)
(tvp5150.c)
static int tvp5150_read(struct i2c_client *c, unsigned char addr)
{
        unsigned char buffer[1];
        int rc;
        buffer[0] = addr;
        if (1 != (rc = i2c_master_send(c, buffer, 1)))
                tvp5150_dbg(0, "i2c i/o error: rc == %d (should be 1)\n", rc);
        msleep(10);
        if (1 != (rc = i2c_master_recv(c, buffer, 1)))
                tvp5150_dbg(0, "i2c i/o error: rc == %d (should be 1)\n", rc);
        tvp5150_dbg(2, "tvp5150: read 0x%02x = 0x%02x\n", addr, buffer[0]);
        return (buffer[0]);
}
(i2c issues within some driver)
        /* This code detects calls by card attach_inform */
        if (NULL == t->i2c.dev.driver) {
                tuner_dbg ("tuner 0x%02x: called during i2c_client
register by adapter's attach_inform\n", c->addr);
                return;
        }
... that code doesn't even work anymore since the i2c.dev.driver is
always initialized.
just reading through it and cleaning up some code isn't so difficult
and can be done by many people - if they're allowed/wanted to do so.
