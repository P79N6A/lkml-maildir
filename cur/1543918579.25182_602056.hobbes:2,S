         Hey there,
I've seen the changes you made in commit b6a2fea39318 and I guess they
might be responsible for my xargs breakage...
In the kernel source tree, if I run a stupid find | xargs ls, I now get
this:
xargs: ls: Argument list too long
Which is kind of annoying but I can work around it though make distclean in
my kernel tree dies with the same symptom (aka -E2BIG).
I run a vanilla 2.6.23-rc9 (Linux version 2.6.23-rc9 (mchouque@shookaylt)
(gcc version 4.1.2 20070925 (Red Hat 4.1.2-27)) #1 Tue Oct 2 08:13:47 EDT
2007) on FC7...
Let me know if I can do anything.  I'm going to try to bisect the problem
after I recompile the kernel without this patch...
Best,
Mathieu
