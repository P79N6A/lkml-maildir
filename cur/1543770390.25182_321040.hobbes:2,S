I guess after the various subsystem trees have merged their stuff
post-2.6.12 (I tend to wait until after they've merged, although sometimes
people are slow and I get bored).  Say, 1-2 weeks after 2.6.12 is released.
And I'd guess 2.6.12 is 1-2 weeks away.

gack, OK.  The kexec patches are a major source of x86 churn.  I don't know
if we'll be merging all the kexec stuff for 2.6.13.  Probably we will.
