No, I mean the three listed on Microsoft's website:
# U.S. Patent #5,579,517 "Common name space for long and short 
filenames" Nov 26, 1996
# U.S. Patent #5,758,352  "Common name space for long and short 
filenames" May 26, 1998
# U.S. Patent #6,286,013 "Method and system for providing a common name 
space for long and short file names in an operating system" September 4, 
2001
