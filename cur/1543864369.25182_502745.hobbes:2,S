Although solving the problem at the fb layer level is probably the
correct/best way to do it, I am not aware of people having problems
with broken EDIDs and non-nVidia cards. By contrast, workarounds for
nVidia and broken EDIDs is a very common thing to do even on Windows.
Both the Windows and the Linux proprietary drivers need SoftEDID
specifications to work around these problems. I don't know if this is
just because of the way the driver are written, though, or if nVidia
cards are particularly unable to handle monitors with broken EDIDs.
Plus, providing an fb-layer-level solution is way beyond my kernel
programming experience :)
