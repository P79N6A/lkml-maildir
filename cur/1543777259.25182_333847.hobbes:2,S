Subject: [07/11] v4l cx88 hue offset fix
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

-stable review patch.  If anyone has any objections, please let us know.
------------------
Changed hue offset to 128 to correct behavior in cx88 cards.  Previously, 
setting 0% or 100% hue was required to avoid blue/green people on screen.  
Now, 50% Hue means no offset, just like bt878 stuff.
