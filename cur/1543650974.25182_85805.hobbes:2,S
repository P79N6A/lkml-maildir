	I always liked the AIX dumper choices.  You could either dump to
the swap area (and startup detects the dump and moves it to the
filesystem before swapon) or provide a dedicated dump partition.  The
latter was prefered.
	Either of these methods merely require the dumper to correctly
write to one disk partition.  This is about as simple as you are going
to get in disk dumping.
