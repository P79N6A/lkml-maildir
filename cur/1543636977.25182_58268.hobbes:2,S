i'm not so sure about flags_t. 'unsigned long' worked pretty well so far,
and i do not see the need for a more complex (or more opaque) irqflags
type. It's not that we confuse flags with some other flag all that
frequently that would necessiate some structure-based more abstract
protection of these variables.
(wrt. inline functions, every architecture is free to define them as
inline functions as they see fit.)
