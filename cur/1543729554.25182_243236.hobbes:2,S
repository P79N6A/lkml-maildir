I sent a patch to support the Medion RC to the linux-usb-devel list in
April 04 (
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.usb.devel/20928
) but it
got ignored. I think the main problem is to support the different key
mappings in the driver. The easiest approach would be to expand the hard
coded key translation table for each supported RC. If that would be
acceptable, I could prepare a patch.
Is there a another way to handle remote control key mappings in the
input subsystem?
