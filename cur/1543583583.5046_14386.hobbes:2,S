  Yes.
  High-end Intel PCs have also had interleaved buses for a few years
now.  So it is not just for Sun h/w.

  Ah, I broke my code!!!!! :(
  In my original slab, the code to do "packing" of objects into a single
cache line was #if-def'ed out for SMP to avoid the possibility of
false-sharing between objects.  Not a large possibility, but it exists.

  Only the caller knows about the attributes and usage of an object, so
they should be able to request (not demand) the offset/alignment of the
allocator. (OK, they can demand the alignment.)

  I do, but like you, I don't have any data to prove my point.
  Time to get profiling?
