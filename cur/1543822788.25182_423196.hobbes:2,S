            Summary: #ifdef CONFIG_PM causes MPT to not compile
     Kernel Version: 2.6.17-rc4
             Status: NEW
           Severity: blocking
              Owner: io_other@kernel-bugs.osdl.org
          Submitter: bill@crowellsystems.com
Most recent kernel where this bug did not occur: 2.6.17-rc3
Distribution: slack
Hardware Environment: i386
Software Environment: gcc 3.3
Problem Description: /drivers/message/fusion/mpt* using #ifdef CONFIG_PM 
are not
exporting the mpt_suspend mpt_resume. I do not know why we would want to
exercise power management on high-performance scsi controllers in the first
place. LSI controllers are server devices.
Steps to reproduce: compile the kernel. causes a kernel compilation failure.
Steps to fix:
comment out the #ifdef CONFIG_pm and corresponding #endif to disable this
compilation flag. recompile and the world is happy.
