I agree, and I imagine you'd have a hard time finding someone who  
actually *likes* the errno convention :)

Yup.  That's how the current code (and epoll, and fs/aio.c, and..) work.
Cancelation comes into this discussion, I think.  Hopefully its  
reasonable to expect userspace to be able to manage cookies well  
enough that they can use them to issue cancels and only hit the ops  
they intend to.  It means we have to give them the tools to  
differentiate between a racing completion and cancelation so they can  
reuse a cookie at the right time, but that doesn't sound fatal.

This would be my preference.

Maybe, sure.  I don't have a lot of insight into this.  Hopefully  
some arch maintainers can jump in?
