I have similar inclination, that is inspired from the implementation of
"NTFS TNG": hard sector size should always equal sb->blocksize.  This
allows for fine-grained operations at the O_DIRECT level, logical block
sizes > PAGE_CACHE_SIZE, easy implementation of fragments (>= hard sect
size), O_DIRECT for fragments, and other stuff.
This works right now in 2.4 and 2.5 with no modification to the VFS
core.
