I don't use swap prefetch (nor -ck or -mm). If someone who has the patch 
applied waits to hit enter until swap prefetch has prefetched it all back in 
again, it certainly will.
Swap prefetch's potential to do larger reads back from swapspace than a 
random segfaulting app could well be very significant. Reads are dwarved by 
seeks. If this program does what you wanted, please use it to show us.
