Mmm.. too bad linux-kernel wasn't CC'd on that, or I might have
found the patch and saved some sleep.  Good to see that it has
been fixed down in a subsystem tree, though.

Yeah, something is very broken somewhere, because the _compat ioctl()s
should really produce the same behaviour as the 64-bit ones.
Looking forward to seeing this regression fixed in mainline ASAP.
