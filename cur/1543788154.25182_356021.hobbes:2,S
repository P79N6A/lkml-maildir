Vitaly ... comments from Russell and Pavel both addresses your comments
about that obsolete parameter.  What letter?  The one I remember was
one responding to Mark Underwood (?) where you complained about issuing
three calls for one suspend event.  You can't have it both ways!!
Either that parameter should be used in the documented way (call the
suspend method three times, one right after another) or it should be used
more sanely (parameter is constant.
USB can suspend just fine, thank you, though starting with 2.6.12 some
bugs seem to have crept in; fixes are in the 2.6.15 prepatchces.

Most folk who've considered the question would like to see it go away.
Except ... making sure every driver in a few dozen architectures still
builds after removing that parameter is more than the usual amount of
janitorial work!
Progress could start by updating Documentation/driver-model/driver.txt to
say "don't test that parameter", reducing future confusion on this point.
