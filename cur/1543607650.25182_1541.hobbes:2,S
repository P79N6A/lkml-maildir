On linux/fs/namespace.c there is following comment: (from linux 2.4.12)
/*
 * Absolutely minimal fake fs - only empty root directory and nothing else.
 * In 2.5 we'll use ramfs or tmpfs, but for now it's all we need - just
 * something to go with root vfsmount.
 */
<...>
static DECLARE_FSTYPE(root_fs_type, "rootfs", rootfs_read_super, FS_NOMOUNT);
 
But I do not think that that comment refers to equivalent scheme
than what you are proposing.
