no, all data is first written into the buffer cache and will be written
to disk later.

Writing single bytes can be slow because of another reason:
system calls are expensive and it makes sense to buffer data in the
application and send it to the operating system in one big system call.

I'm not sure if i understood your question correctly but yes,
The IO Controller has full access to physical memory through DMA.

They are synchronous. Otherwise you couldn't access your data at the
moment read() returns.
