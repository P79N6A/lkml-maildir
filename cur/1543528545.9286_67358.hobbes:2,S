DSM isn't nonsense. Porting _is_ easier and computers usually _are_
cheaper than people. You pulled the "200" and "20" out of thin air;
it is actually "249" and "243".

No, the DSM crowd says "try it". I've seen the code, and I know that
you can port to DSM in a trivial amount of time. Most of your porting
problems need to be solved for message passing too, such as the
method used to start all your processes. The actual DSM changes can
be done with a perl script!
It is foolish to rewrite code that might run fast enough with a
quick DSM conversion. If DSM isn't right for your problem, then
you know to go ahead with the expensive rewrite.

This is also just wrong. If there was a solution that was both
easier and faster than DSM, you might be right. You can only point
to solutions that are one or the other though. DSM is a compromise.
For both ease of use and the performance, you get something partway
between SMP and message passing.

Pages are like huge cache lines. Don't gripe about cache lines, OK?
Good SMP code avoids cache line ping pong. Bad code doesn't bother.
(then again, if the "bad" code was cheap, maybe it isn't so bad)
