Randy:
Is there any simple easy way to find out in which kernel release a 
particular line of code first appeared?  Or to find out whether that line 
is or isn't present in a particular release?
The timestamps in BitKeeper don't help much.  They seem to reflect the 
first time the code was put into _any_ BitKeeper repository, not the time 
it was entered into Linus's tree.  The web interface to the linux-2.6 tree 
doesn't offer any way to view a particular source file as of a particular 
release tag.
I don't fancy downloading lots and lots of enormous patch files, searching
for one small entry.  Or lots of kernel source tarballs, for that matter.
There's got to be an easier way.  Do you know of one?
