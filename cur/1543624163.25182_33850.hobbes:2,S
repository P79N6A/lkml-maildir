TOPS-20 never had the concept of link(2), and VMS has an anemic version
that nobody ever used so far as I know.  (There are a few VMS programs
which use the ability to create a file with *no directory links at all*,
which occasionally leaves some interesting puzzles for the sysadmin after
a crash.)
Renaming would create a new version, I think, so it might push the oldest
version off the end.  Explicitly renaming as existing version N should
have no side-effects (other than deletion of the original content of
version N).

True.  Studying other OSes for useful ideas is sensible, but swiping those
ideas wholesale only works if the two are fairly closely aligned in the
affected area.  Sometimes the idea needs major rework, and sometimes the
graft produces a monster.
