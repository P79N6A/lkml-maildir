whee.
Things are going much much more smoothly now than they were in 2.6.24-rcX
and 2.6.23-rcX.  Tree integration problems are negligible and build errors
are far fewer and runtime problems seem to be less too.   Fingers crossed.
I guess this is due to a combinaton of
a) linux-next
b) intensive whining and
c) extra care which maintainers are taking (due to a) and b))
I suspect that fewer people are testing linux-next and -mm nowadays.  We
should encourage them to do so, although given the general
trainwreckishness of current mainline, this isn't really where our effort
should be expended.
