	I had some problems earlier with modules.conf, so I renamed it since an
earlier modutils-2.2.2-prex and I'm currently running with
modutils-2.1.85 without modules.conf or conf.modules, begging the
question as to whether you really need either.
	The really odd problem in the strace was the "No Space left on device"
with nearly a Gig lying around.
