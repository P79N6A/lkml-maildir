Subject: [PATCH] x86-64: Make GART_IOMMU kconfig help text more specific (trivial)
Have the GART_IOMMU help text specify that this is the hardware IOMMU in
amd64 processors.  This will be significant if/when other IOMMUs are
added to the x86-64 architecture. :-)
Also, note that the previous help text stated that IOMMU was needed for
>3GB memory instead of >4GB.  This is fixed in the newer version.
Thanks,
Jon
