Initial testing on my NUMA box looks good.  So far, I only have
kernbench numbers, but the system time shows a nice decrease,
and the CPU % busy time has gone up.  
Kernbench:
                        Elapsed       User     System        CPU
           ingoD7-59    28.944s   285.008s    79.998s    1260.8%
             stock59    29.668s   283.762s    82.286s      1233%
I'll try to get more testing in over the next few days.
There was one minor build error introduced by the patch:
#define NODE_THRESHOLD          125
was removed, but the NUMA code uses this.
