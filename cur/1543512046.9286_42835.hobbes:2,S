rename(). link(). revalidate(), if you want to go inside the kernel.

Spoken as a true EMACS user... You see, there is one nasty problem -
inside devfs is _not_ a normal fs. Unfortunately this "inside" includes
the interface with VFS. It makes VFS-related changes much trickier. Yes,
current device handling is not good either. The right thing would be a
separate fs that WOULD NOT BE MOUNTED. Devices should live there. Device
inodes in ext2/ufs/etc. (including devfs, BTW) should be considered as
pseudo-links to that filesystem. IOW, we ought to have two in-core inodes
here instead of trying to stuff everything into one. It's not the same as
Richard's devfs, but it would be useful for all filesystems and it would
offload lots of stuff from devfs proper. Devfs in its current form tries
to do way too many things and effectively ties hands to VFS work. Badly.
That's my main problem with it - user-visible interface is less severe
one.
