Sure enough - rmmod usbhid; modprobe usbmouse reproduces the exact
same problem on a working kernel.
But the thing is I use the same base configuration across all kernels
I build (sans of course the newly added config options) - so something
changed somewhere and now usbmouse gets used instead of usbhid.
What's the deal with usbmouse though - is it supposed to be working or
is it considered lost cause in favor of usbhid? May be if people don't
need to use it and it is not actively looked into, we can
disable/remove it?
Thanks
