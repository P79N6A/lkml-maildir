You might want to check on the apache and openssl lists. A lot of
crypto drivers are handled from userspace directly or with modules
that don't hit the base kernel.

Some of that probably can be offloaded. You'd need code (preferably in
the user tools) that can compute if a given path through the ipchains
rules is expressable in the hardware and if so to enable it. In terms
of things like flow control and other magic try netdev@oss.sgi.com. Dave
and Jamal get very excited when they talk about NAPI but it just makes
my head hurt 8)

What of it do you actually need in kernel space - encrypted file systems
certainly ought to be there but are not very well handled in Linux proper
right now - but anything else ?
