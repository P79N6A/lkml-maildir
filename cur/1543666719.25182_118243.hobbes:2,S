I assume smalldevfs is what you get when you configure devfs in 2.5.64-mm8?
It works fine for me, on smp with debian testing. I changed nothing
at all, and noticed that devfsd didn't run.  But it don't seem necessary,
it seems to work even without those compatibility symlinks.

Please continue, it works and I understand the code is an improvement.
I'll begin testing on my work pc too.
