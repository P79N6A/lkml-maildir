I know --- I've been traveling for most of the last month and have
just moved house, so I haven't got a new kiobuf diff out yet, but I
haven't lost this patch.  I'll try to get a new one out in the three
days I've got left before leaving for Orkney once I get back to the
UK!  There's other cool stuff I want to package too, including the SGI
rw-kiovec code and davem's pipe stuff.
Cheers,
 Stephen
