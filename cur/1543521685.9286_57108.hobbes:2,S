Actually, this is very undesirable, as we can currently ship and use the
filesystem modules without any kernel patch.  It's not for reason of having
binary modules (open source, available at ftp.lustre.org), but rather to
avoid having to recompile the kernel in order to use the filesystem.  The
VFS interface is very well defined, and we don't need any special hooks at
this time, so we don't want to add a line (where would it go anyways?) that
is simply "static kmem_cache_t *our_cache = NULL".
In any case, I think kmem_cache_destroy() will work (will see next time my
devel box is rebooted).  However, most modules don't call this...
Cheers, Andreas
