Sorry for the delay Kasper, the driver is still "ati"; if you have DRI 
compiled and enabled, the "ati" driver will attempt to set up DRI via the 
r300_dri.so that should exist in either /usr/X11R7/lib/modules/dri, 
or /usr/X11R7/lib/xorg/modules/dri.
You'll need a fairly recently kernel with drm support for r300/r400, but it 
seems to work OOTB.
If you do NOT have the dri drivers, it is trivial to install them. Download 
MesaLib-6.4.1, then issue:
make linux-dri
When this finishes, point the installer to the right directory. I initially 
made the mistake of pointing it directly to /usr/X11R7/lib, but it copies the 
XXX_dri.so's to this directory, so it should actually 
be /usr/X11R7/lib/modules/dri (create this directory prior to installation)..
..and that should be it.
