I should clarify my question: I do not really mean reading RAW from
the device, but I want to read RAW like how its on this, without any
error-checking or anything.
Like the "CDROMREADRAW"-ioctl for CD-ROMs.

Just an idea, but try openning "/dev/fd0" for example -as the floppy-
directly, then "lseek"ing around and reading/writing as necessary.
Same should work for ide (open /dev/hda, or /dev/hdb, etc.) or scsi
(/dev/scd0, etc.).
As per where the useful information is stored on the disk, you'll have
to study filesystem code, and there I couldn't help you.
