Subject: how to free bootmem-allocated memory after system is up?

I've got some memory that was allocated very early on using the bootmem API.
Later on in the boot sequence I determine that I don't actually need 
that memory, but the bootmem bitmaps have been torn down.
Is there any way to tell the memory subsystem, "by the way, here are a 
bunch of pages that you can use that you didn't know about before"?
