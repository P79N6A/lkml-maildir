Hi,
I'm uploading Frame Relay (generic HDLC) driver with a hardware
drivers for SDL Inc. RISCom/N2 cards and for SBE Inc. wanXL card family
to 
ftp://ftp.pm.waw.pl/pub/Linux/hdlc/
This is work in progress, currently will work only on i386+, no SMP
support yet. The interface could be eventually merged with other
generic HDLC interfaces etc. Kernel 2.2 only.
