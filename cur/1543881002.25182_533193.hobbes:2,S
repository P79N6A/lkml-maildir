i just tried ocbench-0.3, and it is indeed very nice!
Would it make sense perhaps to (optionally?) also log some sort of 
periodic text feedback to stdout, about the quality of scheduling? Maybe 
even a 'run this many seconds' option plus a summary text output at the 
end (which would output measured runtime, observed longest/smallest 
latency and standard deviation of latencies maybe)? That would make it 
directly usable both as a 'consistency of X app scheduling' visual test 
and as an easily shareable benchmark with an objective numeric result as 
well.
