which is the precise kernel version used? We toned down calibration a 
bit recently.
The immediate workaround would be to use the migration_cost=0 boot 
parameter.
Generally, i agree that it makes sense to not calibrate at all on 
virtual platforms. Does the patch below help?  It gives virtual 
platforms a way to provide a default migration cost and thus avoid the 
boot-time calibration altogether. (I have tested it on x86, it does the 
expected thing.) This needs to hit v2.6.16 too.

---------
introduce the CONFIG_DEFAULT_MIGRATION_COST method for an architecture
to set the scheduler migration costs. This turns off automatic detection
of migration costs. Makes sense on virtual platforms, where migration
costs are hard to measure accurately.
