Certainly sounds plausible; if the first process is able to create a lot of
runnable processes/threads in a single timeslice, the scheduler is then hit
with a huge queue to plough through once that timeslice ends.
Making calls to clone() force a schedule() might help here? That way, hopefully
each thread can run its initialisation code before the next one is created,
avoiding the problem?

Perhaps; alternatively, if it schedules the new thread to run before resuming
the parent thread, each thread is initialised when created, rather than
building up a huge backlog, that would avoid the problem.

Either of those could help. Alternatively, have you tried inserting a yield
instruction in the Java code after creating each thread, to make sure the new
thread gets a chance to initialise?
