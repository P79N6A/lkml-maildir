Subject: Race condition in 2.2.15 and 2.2.16

There is a race condition somewhere in linux-2.2.15 and 2.2.16 that is
demonstrated here.
Cut and save the included 'Makefile'.
Execute:
mkdir zam
mv Makefile zam
cd zam
Make sure you are in the empty directory with only "Makefile"
Execute:
while true ; do make clean ; done
The file, Makefile, will be deleted. A zero-length one will sometimes
remain in /tmp
----- Makefile -------
#
#   Warning!!  Put this in an EMPTY subdirectory.
#
all:	foo
foo:
	touch foo
clean:
	mv Makefile /tmp
	rm -r * 
	mv /tmp/Makefile .
-------------
Now I know that you don't DO things like this. Please, this is
a demonstration, specifically designed to show a problem that
sometimes occurs in much more subtle ways. This problem can
result in missing source-code files in large directory trees
after working on them for 8-10 solid hours. NotGood(tm).
Cheers,
Dick Johnson
