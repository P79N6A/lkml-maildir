Hmmm... It probably needs to be made conditional on the version of the 
compiler by means of the macros that hold the version numbers.

Excellent. I tried to keep it as simple as possible to make it easier to test 
and follow.

Probably... It's copied directly out of the spinlock stuff. I noticed it at 
the time, but it didn't stick in my memory.

Not so... have you looked at the new __wait_ctx_common() function? It 
actually ignores the exclusive flag since it uses other criteria as to whom 
to wake. All the add_wait_queue_exclusive() function does is put the process 
on the _back_ of the queue as far as rwsems are concerned.

Sorry to pre-empt you, but have you seen my "advanced" patch? I sent it to 
the list in an email with the subject:
	[PATCH] i386 rw_semaphores, general abstraction patch
I added a general fallback implementation with the inline implementation 
functions written wholly in C and using spinlocks.

Agreed... I'll think more in it on Tuesday, though... after Easter.
Your points, however, look fairly reasonable.

It does. Using my test program & module, try:
	driver -5 & sleep 1; driver 100 &
Keep doing "ps", and you'll see all the reader processes jump into the S 
state at the same time, once all the writers have finished. You may need to 
increase the delay between the ups and downs in the module to see it clearly.
