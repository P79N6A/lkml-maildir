a) "Transport Attributes" _is_ its name,
b) It sits across SCSI Core, i.e. on the same level.
c) It was never intended to add management.
d) Its inteface to SCSI Core is badly defined and an "invention",
   (and very poor at that).
The reason for d) is that
1) it tries to unify different _transports_,
2) does _not_ follow _any_ spec or standard.
Look at this, while you repeat verbaitm a single
quote, I give you technical arguments, then you just
repeat a single quote verbatim... Sad.

Maybe the picures and the write up here will help:
