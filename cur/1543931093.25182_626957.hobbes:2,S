How about this, then?
The ->cap fields of struct acpi_video_device and struct acpi_video_bus
are 1B each, not 4B. The oversized memset()'s corrupted the subsequent
list_head fields. This resulted in silent corruption without
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST and BUG's with it. This patch uses sizeof() to pass
the proper bounds to the memset() calls and thereby correct the bugs.
The patch was seen to resolve the issue on the affected system.
