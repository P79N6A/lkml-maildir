duplicating that would not be a very good design - and 32-bit highmem is a 
reality we have to live with for some time to come. The impact:
   10 files changed, 251 insertions(+), 81 deletions(-)
looks rather to the point and seems relatively compressed. In fact 32-bit 
Xen could end up being the largest user (and tester) of swiotlb facilities 
in general, as modern 64-bit platforms tend to have hw IOMMUs. Having more 
code sharing and more testers is a plus.
