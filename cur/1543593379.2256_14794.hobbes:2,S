reiserfs does this when it fails to write metadata or log buffers,
continuing without a panic or readonly mount will result in FS corruption.  
A forced readonly mount is a much better solution, but I haven't had a
chance yet to make sure it safely prevents writeback of all metadata, and
cleans things up properly.
