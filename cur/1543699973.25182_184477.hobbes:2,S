BTW, I'm reminding about aliases mentioned by me few weeks ago
(here: 
http://www.ussg.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0312.0/1263.html
),
which could be built into appropriate modules (here in modprobe.conf
format):
alias ppp-compress-21 bsd_comp
alias ppp-compress-24 ppp_deflate
alias ppp-compress-26 ppp_deflate
alias iso9660 isofs
alias block-major-11 sr_mod
alias char-major-21-* sg
Also note that MODULE_ALIAS_BLOCKDEV_MAJOR doesn't work up to test11,
because for e.g. /dev/fd0 kernel calls modprobe with block-major-2 (in
drivers/block/genhd.c?), but MODULE_ALIAS_BLOCKDEV_MAJOR(FLOPPY_MAJOR)
adds "block-major-2-*" alias.
(similar problem with MODULE_ALIAS_CHARDEV_MAJOR was fixes few releases
 ago by changing requet_module call in fs/chsr_dev.c - in 1.1414.1.23)
