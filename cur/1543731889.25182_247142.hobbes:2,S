I believe CSA does than the others.

Does anyone know if CSA is a super-set of BSD accounting and ELSA?
What would be missing?
I'm unconvinced that enhancing BSD accounting to encompass the
capabilities of CSA is appropriate.
I think we can make the data collection additions common.  That should
encompass the bulk of the invasive changes that are required by at least
CSA proper (ie there are still the PAGG changes for job support that we
can discuss separately).  Not sure about BSD accounting and ELSA.
With that cooperation, we can then either proceed with further
cooperation, or if the goals and users of the different accounting
approaches dictate different kernel modules and user support,
I'd propose that might be OK.
