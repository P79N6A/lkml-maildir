	OK, I had forgotten that I had a VFAT mounted partition on
	that machine (not that I knew that it may have some problem).
	I tried to umount it before running slocate.cron and it had
	been OK.
	So, something is definitively broken between 2.2.10-ac4 and
	2.2.10-ac8 regarding the VFAT code.
	Thanks,
A+,
