/etc/fstab covers static values of things, any given config file can.  quota
files cover storage of the kernel's in core map when the kernel isn't running.

people want storage of in core data one way or another, from quotas to devfs
to network routes and firewall rules.
it's not so different than the similar suspending to disk concept.  when you
start, load the maps, when you end, save them.  at all other times, operate on
in core data.

so  if i spend a grand for my modems, i should also hack up scripts?  why
should i even go through the bother of the for i in x and just let them
automagically and correctly appear in /dev?
your logic escapes me.  because you feel writing little scripts to do all this
maintenance is within your grasp, you think everyone should do it your way?

it's spelled "lose lose" Doctor.  devfs is by no means a losing situation for
me, *I* win.

it does magically manage my devices, very nicely too.

nor can you know how much devfs benefits me.

yes.  i want the kernel to do it for me because the kernel won't make mistakes
and always matches the running state, nor do i require an admin to run
scripts.
why are you so adamantly refusing the conveniences and ease of use it affords
those of us that use it?  why do you insist we rely on hacked up scripts?
