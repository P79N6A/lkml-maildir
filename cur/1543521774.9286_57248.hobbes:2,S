This means that kernel decides your chipset is not UDMA capable, while the
drive is...
Note, that driver author (from ALI) suggested that for M5229 rev. <= 0x20
UDMA is "not stable", so it should be disabled by the driver...

Quite standard results for mword DMA mode 2 ...

In UDMA/Mode2, yes. But you must use apropriate (UDMA-capable) controller

This chipset revision is not UDMA capable...

My WD drive with same chipset revision reports about 8.5 MB/s.
On unloaded AXP system (CMD646) with IBM drive I observe ~12 MB/s.
I observe, that for many BIOSes timings are calculated basing on maximum
possible PCI clock (42.5 MHz ?) rather than on currently being set one.
It effects in a bit worse transfer results. To test it you can try:
1. put the idebus=... parameter to the kernel during boot
   (I use idebus=30, as set on my MoBo)
2. hdparm -d0 ...
3. hdpatm -p ...        # calculate new timings
4. hdparm -X34 ...
5. hdparm -d1 ...
Difference shouldn't be meaningfull, but results slightly better.
Cheers
