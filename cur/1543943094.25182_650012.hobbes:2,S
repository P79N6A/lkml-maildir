Ok, good.

I would suggest a patch mis-application problem first (or possibly even 
the patch itself being broken - I simply didn't look very closely at the 
patch, but it *looked* ok).
If it's a compiler bug, it's a pretty big one, and quite frankly, I doubt 
it. Compiler bugs do happen, but they are pretty rare, and they tend to 
have more subtle effects than the one you see. 
However:

4.2.3? Really? That's pretty damn recent, and so almost totally untested. 
That does make a compiler bug at least more likely.
So yes, if you already have other compilers installed, you should try 
them. If it really is a compiler bug, it's a really bad one, and you would 
want to let the gcc people know.
Still, I'd double-check that the
	asc_dvc_varp->overrun_buf = kzalloc(ASC_OVERRUN_BSIZE, GFP_KERNEL);
line was added properly first. You should see it way after the point where 
it did 
	asc_dvc_varp = &boardp->dvc_var.asc_dvc_var;
to initialize it (and both statements should be inside a
	if (ASC_NARROW_BOARD(boardp)) {
conditional - please check that the source code looks sane too).
