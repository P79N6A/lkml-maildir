Leonard & other Linux friends...
I've mentioned this to you before, but never had this level of detail before.
I have a BugLogic FlashPoint LT (BT-930) and a BT-946C.
The BT-930 & ZIP-100 hate each other when used with the 2.2.12
kernel.  The BT-946C works just fine in the same system in the same slot,
etc.  Here's the details of what's detected.  Note that I copied it down
by hand because I can't get the system to boot with it installed.  :-(
I can occassionally get it to boot all the way, then it hangs the first
time that I try to access the ZIP.  The Seagate is used for swap space,
and has /home mounted on it, and I don't experience any problems talking
to it at all.
IIRC, the same setup (with a couple more SCSI drives in the chain) worked
just fine with 2.0.36 on the BT-930.  It was when I upgraded to 2.2.x that
I started seeing the problems, and then got a used 946 to test with,
and the problems went away.  There's another HD that I have that didn't
like 2.2.x and the BT-930, also, but worked fine under 2.0.36.  I'll
see if I can replicate that setup again over the weekend.
AFAIK, the boards are configured almost identically.
One final note.  I just upgraded the BIOS on the BT-930 to 1.41i to
see if it would solve this problem, but it appears to have made no
difference at all.
Thanks

The system hangs right here.

The system boots normally and works fine (except for some other unrelated
