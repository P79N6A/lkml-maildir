I think I have a fix that uses the proper locking sitting in my queue that
I haven't pushed because I have been got to look at just about every
irq but present in 2.6.19-rcX.  Then for some reason I had this stupid
usb debug cable sitting on my desk and since I can't stand useful
things going unused I just wrote a driver for that :)
Anyway with a little luck I should be working on the pid namespace and
this stuff later today so I will try and send out the proper patch.
Not that I'm really opposed to this infrastructure but I'd like to
avoid it until we really need it.
Eric
