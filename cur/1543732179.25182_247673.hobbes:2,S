You could buy an Altix, which works fine.  :)  Or you could try to configure a 
kernel with arch/ia64/configs/generic_defconfig, e.g.:
  # tar zxf linux-2.6.8.1.tar.gz
  # cd linux-2.6.8.1
  # make generic_defconfig
  # make compressed
  # cp vmlinux.gz /boot/efi
  <boot it>
If that doesn't work, please describe what happens in more detail.
