Sure, just be sure you POWER down the device(s) and the
interface.  IDE is no more designed to be hot-swap than the
ISA buss.  It was originally a buss level emulation of a
specific Western Digital controller for ST506 drives.  Talk
to an EE familiar with the spec and implementations and make
sure that your card can either power down or go buffered
tristate.  Smoking can be hazardous to your computer's
health.
Disclaimer: I am not an Electronics Engineer, nor an expert
on IDE/ATA/ATAPI yadda, yadda, yadda.  I wrote because this
thread, while useful for the future  was on a tangent that
wasn't telling John Summerfield how he might actually do
what he wants, today.
