Hi,
I hope the problem I am posting is appropriate for this forum.
We have a Quantum DLT 4000 SCSI-2 tape device connected to a
RedHat Linux 7.1 box using BusLogic BT-950 card.
When the system boots, we get the following messages on the
screen:
	Vendor: HP Model: C5173-4000 Media Changer Rev: 3.02
	Vendor: Quantum Model: DLT4000 Rev: CD3C
The /var/log/messages file shows the following message:
	st0: Block limits 1-16777215 bytes.
When I use the mtx utility on /dev/sg0, things are OK. I am
able to do 'inquiry', 'status', 'load', 'unload' operations
properly.
I put a tape cartridge into the drive by using the command
	mtx -f /dev/sg0 load 1
Then I use the mt command as below:
	mt -f /dev/st0 status
	the output is:
	SCSI 2 tape drive:
	File number = 0, block number=0, partition=0
	Tape block size 0 bytes, Density code 0x1a
				(unknown to this mt)
	Soft error count since last status=0
	General status bits on (41010000):
		BOT ONLINE IM_REP_EN
I am using HP 1/2" DLTtape IV Data cartridge.
When I try to do a tar onto the tape, I get the message:
	Wrote only 0 of 10240 bytes
	Error is not recoverable: exiting now
The tape unit was attached to an HP9000 system before. The
HP DLTtape IV cartridges are recommended for this drive.
I thought there may something wrong with the particular
cartridge and so I even tried brand new cartridges. The
results are the same every time.
Can someone please help me understand the problem here ?
I hope to benefit from someone else's experience in this
regard.
Thanks for your time.
