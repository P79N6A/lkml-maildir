I have an interesting problem.  I compiled 2.2.0-pre2 this morning on my
386DX40 (I know, God-awful slow, but it's my router/firewall and I had
the time).  CONFIG_M386 is set, but at boot time 2.2.0-pre2 complains
that I needed to build the kernel for a 386.
The complaint occurs after checking the WP bit.  The check fails, just like
it does in 2.1.129; 2.2.0 doesn't seem to like the answer.
Let me know if you need any more information.
