My first guess would be hardware also, except in this case I've seen
similiar things on three different dual processor G4 systems running 2.2,
and they work fine with 2.4.
Does Oracle for Linux us pthreads or the 'clone()' system call?
Can you try running the included pthreads program on an 2.2.19 SMP system
(but make it's idle, since if this is a genric 2.2 SMP bug it will
probably crash the system)
Compile with the following command:
gcc -o pt pthread-test.c -lpthread 
Run it repeatedly:
I=0; while [ $? -eq 0 ] ; let I=I+1; do ./pt ; done ; echo $I
on 2.2.19 on a mac dual G4, the pthreads program will sometimes get 
segfaults and illegal instructions, and if I run it long enough, I will 
eventually get the following in dmesg:
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
swap_free: Trying to free nonexistent swap-page
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
swap_free: offset exceeds max
If I keep running it, I will eventually wind up with a kernel panic on an 
illegal instruction. Something is corrupting memory, and in my case, the 
kernel panics are caused by a '0x00000008' being written over a random 
location in the kernel code.

           pthread_create(t+i, NULL, thread, NULL);
 
        for (i=0; i<NTH; i++)
           pthread_join(t[i], NULL);
 
        return 0;
