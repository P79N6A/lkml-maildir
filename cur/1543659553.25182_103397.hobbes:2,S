    I'm certain that a lot of work was done porting the typical Unix
    programs to HURD. Eventually, HURD had everything that Linux and
    BSD already had, except for the reputation.
The HURD and BSD are not comparable.  The HURD (and Mach) are a
kernel; BSD is a whole system.
That message has many other errors; I won't note them all.
