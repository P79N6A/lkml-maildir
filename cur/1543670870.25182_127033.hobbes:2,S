Hi Greg,
I support the intent of this patch, but would it not be a better idea to rename 
the struct something like "device_class"? Rationale:
1. See the title of your patch (!!)
2. The word "class" is too generic and conveys no sense that is is to do with 
devices.
3. I know that C++ is never going to make it into the kernel, but...
Thanks, Shaheed
