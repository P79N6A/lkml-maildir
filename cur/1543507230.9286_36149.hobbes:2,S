Well, I certainly saw strange behaviour. The trylock code seemed to be the
prime culprit - it tried to decrement the "waking" count, but it could end
up doing it too late so that people had already seen a increment from a
concurrent "up()".
I'm not saying the new code is bug-free, but it works for me where the old
one did not - and your claim that it is obviously broken is also obviously
wrong, see later..

Well, you're not counting right..

Wrong counting. The "down()" decremented count, so you have
						-2		2
which is exactly right, and explains why there will _not_ be two users in
the critical region at the same time.
