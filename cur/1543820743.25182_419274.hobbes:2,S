I too am getting undefined you_cannot_kmalloc_that_much on x86_64.  Coming
out of
	cache_kobject[cpu] = kmalloc(sizeof(struct kobject), GFP_KERNEL);
in arch/i386/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c
It has to be a compiler bug, I think.
	gcc (GCC) 3.4.2 20041017 (Red Hat 3.4.2-6.fc3)
I cannot use this patch until we find a workaround.
