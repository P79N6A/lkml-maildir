I have 49m of physical ram + 100m swap.    And I have SO 5.0 (personal 
edition) and netscape4.08-libc5.
Ahh.. It was not the kernel problem at all.  I noticed there is a problem
with XF86_S3V which crashes (locked up the mouse pointer along with 
everything eles but MagicSysRq worked fine).  I used to use XF86_SVGA due
to this problem but lately I was testing XF3.3.3 and switched back to
XF86_S3V, and forgot about it.  Possibly caused by a clash in between glibc
(StarOffice) and libc5(XF86)....
Sorry for a bit of disturbance. :)
