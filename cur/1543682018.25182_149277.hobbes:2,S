Just noticed it: I can't unload the module even after bringing the
interface down.
In either case, modprobe hangs and I start getting this message in
syslog:
Jul 17 21:50:44 ezquiel kernel: unregister_netdevice: waiting for eth0
to become free. Usage count = -4
Can't shutdown the system either. Init hangs waiting for modprobe to
die.
