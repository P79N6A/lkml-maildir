This more frequent release idea will basically mimmick what the
even/odd idea will do, except that even/odd will have specific
engineering goals.  Development vs. pure bug fixing.
There are changes that simply have to sit for weeks if not months
in order for all the problems to be weeded out.  I think something
like the 4-level pagetable stuff is the best example.  And yes it
has to occur in Linus's tree so what precious few people do test
his live tree try out the new code.
