Note that this looks a bit less than 8 DWORDs. If your beast use such
cache line size, this can be related to.

Then, the 875 never used cache line based PCI transactions.

Indeed. A least your system hasn't been bitten by PCI cache line related
bugs.
I donnot know how the 875 behaves when supplied with a zero latency timer.
Normally it should consider the timeout to happen immediately, but it must
and is allowed to perform at least one data phase. In this hypothesis, and
given that a latency timer greater than 22 PCI clocks makes problem, I may
risk the following:
Your hardware (probably the host bridge) is only able as a PCI target to
provide a limited amount of data for the current PCI read transaction in
some circumstances. It deasserts GNT#. If the master wants more data it
has to force transaction termination, otherwise it is the master that will
terminate the transaction.
Then the cause of the problem could be something like:
- The host bridge is unable to terminate a read transaction as a target
  and just feeds the master with stale data if it cannot get good ones.
  (Unlikely, but why not?)
- The host bridge just does not terminate the transaction in time in
  some circumstances and provides stale data to the master until the
  transaction terminates.
This is an example, probably just wrong.
Anyway, given that short latency timers hide (fix?) the problem, your
system seems to like much better PCI transactions to be preferently
(always?) terminated by the master.
