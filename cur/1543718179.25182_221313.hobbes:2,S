Patch 3 of 4
Fix PHY transceiver detection code to fall back to known PHY and not to
the last detected.
The code checks every transceiver detected for link status and type, but
fails when ghost transceivers are detected, deciding to use the last one
detected.
With this patch the driver should choose the correct transceiver even
when some ghosts are detected by checking for the type of the tranceiver
it is going to use.
This patch needs that patch #2 is applied before.
Any comment is highly appreciated.
Dominik:
Could you please test this patch ? Thanks.
