A first step could be to allocate those two char arrays with kmalloc()
instead of on the stack, but then I guess that dump_stack() gets
called from places where we may not really want to be calling
kmalloc(). I guess we could allocate the buffers earlier (like at boot
time) and store pointers somewhere where dump stack can get to them
later when it needs them.

We could also simply have it warn at a higher limit, like 1024 bytes
instead of 512. But I guess then we would get too many false positives
and make it less useful.
