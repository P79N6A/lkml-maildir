Here's an easy benchmark to demonstrate problem :
1.Run Mozilla
2.Minimize
3=>Mozilla Resident Size (mrs) : 24Mb
4.Run updatedb
5.=>mrs : 15Mb
6.updatedb ends up
7.mrs doesn't move at all (yes, it goes down as I'm typing this msg :)).
So my question is :
Don't we have a way to say "whose pages were reclaimed from and
 reattribute its" ? (having in mind memory status per se).
IOW flushing (I guess it's pdflush relevant ? ) do work for dead
processes but doesn't care about applications alive...
