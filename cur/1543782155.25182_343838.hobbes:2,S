This may have something to do with this patch, introduced with 2.6.10 
(see the ChangeLog-2.6.10).
It would explain why I had no problems on ~20 machines with 2.6.8.1 
kernel, and I have this issue on the machines with 2.6.11.5 kernel.
[PATCH] tulip: make tulip_stop_rxtx() wait for DMA to fully stop
From: "John W. Linville" <linville@.........com>
	
tulip_stop_rxtx() doesn't wait for DMA to fully stop like the function
call name implies.
	
This was submitted through my employer -- I am not the original author 
of this	patch.  However, I passed it by Jeff Garizk and he expressed 
interest in having it upstream.
