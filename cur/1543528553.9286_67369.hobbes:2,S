Could you please tell me if there is (or planned) the sxatter/gather or
queue processing on file I/O level.
I mean the syscall there you pass an array of different requests which may
read or write data in different locations of file. Of couse this may be
implemented on user level but the in this case you lose the gain of requests
reordering and processing them in optimal sequence.
