That's a vendor kernel of some form, yes?

I'd suggest that you either recompile this vendor kernel with
CONFIG_DEBUG_SLAB=y or try a later kernel.org kernel and see if it's fixed.
Or look for an updated kernel from your vendor.  And check the vendor's
bug tracking system for other reports of this problem.
I don't recall having seen anyone else report this crash.
