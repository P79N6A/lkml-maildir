Well it was a bit long time ago, I measured on a Tiger box with
CPUs of 1.3 GHz:
Flushing a page of 64 Kbytes, with modified data in D-cache
(it's slower that not having modified data in the D-cache):
13.1 ... 14.7 usec.
You may have quicker machines, but having more CPUs or a NUMA architecture
can slow it down considerably:
- more CPUs have to agree that that's the moment to carry out a flush
- NUMA adds delay
We may have, say 1 Gbyte / sec local i/o activity (using some RAIDs).
Assume a few % of this 1 Gbyte is the program execution, or program swap in.
It gives some hundreds of new exec pages / sec =>
some msec-s can be lost each sec.
I can agree that it should not be a big deal :-)

As the VM layer is designed to be independent of the page read in stuff...
Thanks,
