To be quite honest, I was not "playing dumb".  I know of the "-a,
and -k" options to man, and when you suggested "-s" I tried it
and it did not work.  I did not do a "man man" to look further,
as I figured that either you were wrong, or had a newer version
of man than did I.
When I execute the above command now I get:
[root@asdf /etc]# man -S perl chop
No manual entry for chop
So, I have yet to see what you're describing.  And I'm NOT
playing dumb this time either.

[root@asdf /etc]# cd /usr/man/manperl
bash: /usr/man/manperl: No such file or directory
