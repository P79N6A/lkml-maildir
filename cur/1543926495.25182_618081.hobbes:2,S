We need to set a selected few values in a few cases where we do
not have a .config file.
allmodconfig for x86 for instance. We would like to generate a
32-bit and a 64-bit version.

Because the patch is in mainline and has been tested by a lot of people
during the last week. And as the functionality is almost equal I do not
see it as a big deal to have the less-perfect solution in one kernel release.
And the only reason the patch were applied to mainline was to fix the build
of the merged x86 architecute - otherwise it was in no way -rc material.

My point is that the .config file is handedited so the syntax should be checked
to best possible extent. If someone specify CONFIG_64BIT=64 we should error out.
