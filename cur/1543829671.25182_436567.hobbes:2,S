sounds weird... the filesystem it implements is afs.
your change also breaks userspace, since the fs type is a mount option
so your change is userspace visible and means people need to fix their
scripts...
maybe openafs should start using "openafs" as type; they're not in the
kernel so they aren't yet bound by the userspace ABI....
