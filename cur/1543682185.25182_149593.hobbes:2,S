Yes, this makes sense.  At the kerror.c level, just return -EDEADLK if in_irq().
Delay packet delivery (via a tasklet, as before) at the evlog.c level instead.
That way, we know at the evlog.c level (in the tasklet) whether the event packet
was delivered to anybody, and can paraphrase it to printk if it wasn't.
Is this the sort of thing you had in mind?
