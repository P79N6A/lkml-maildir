     It's said erroneously, because you go from a problem of having to guess
within a page to having to be exact.
     But again, the Solar Design patch does a lot more than just provide for
a non-executable stack.

     Please stop being an asshole yourself when you are obviously unfamiliar
with all the things the patch does.  And just because something happens to be
your opinion doesn't make it right.  Even the non-executable user stack area
does have value. 
     The patch also provides restrictions on links in a +t directory, it also
prevents users from making hard links to files they don't own.  This breaks a
number of race exploits, like the old passwd race, amoung other things.
     There are some restrictions on writes to FIFO's in +t directories unless
the FIFO is owned by the user or the FIFO is opened without the O_CREAT flag.
     There is the ability to restrict access to proc, for applications where
you do not want one user from watching another, ps only shows a users own
processes, etc.
     There is an option to destroy shared memory segments when not in use.
     There is a provision for priviledge IP aliases.  Not real useful for what
I'm doing but for someone that runs everything on one box it could have some
real utility.
