Subject: [PATCH] 2/5 privilege-cleanup
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

Privilege checking cleanup.  Originally, these diffs were much greater,
but recent cleanups in Linux have already done much of the cleanup.  I
added some explanatory comments in places where the reasoning behind
certain tests is rather subtle.
Also, in traps.c, we can skip the user_mode check in handle_BUG().  The
reason is, there are only two call chains - one via die_if_kernel() and
one via do_page_fault(), both entering from die().  Both of these paths
already ensure that a kernel mode failure has happened.  Also,
the original check here, if (user_mode(regs)) was insufficient anyways,
since it would not rule out BUG faults from V8086 mode execution.
Saving the %ss segment in show_regs() rather than assuming a fixed value
also gives better information about the current kernel state in the
register dump.
