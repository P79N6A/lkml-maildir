No it should not.  The PGD index is FAR to coarse to use - each PGD on
ARM maps 1MB of virtual address space.  Userspace text starts at 32K.
The protection against mmap() MAP_FIXED fiddling with the first page is
handled by the arch-specific mmap() wrappers, so generic code doesn't
have to worry about it.
What generic code _does_ have to worry about is:
(a) not removing the very first page.
(b) not removing the very first pointer to the 2nd level table in the
    1st level tables.
and that is all.  Maybe FIRST_USER_PGD_NR was a bad way of achieving
this, but in the instance of the VM upon which it was originally
implemented (somewhere between 2.2 and 2.4), it was deemed (by others
iirc) to be the best way of achieving it at the time.
