while i disagree with characterising one extra parameter passed down 
plus one extra branch as 'a lot of complexity', i agree that making the 
flush a NOP on VMX is even better. (if it's possible without breaking 
future hardware) I guess you are right that the only true cost here is 
the vmwrite cost, and that there's no impact on CR3 flushing (because it 
happens unconditionally). Forget about this patch.
