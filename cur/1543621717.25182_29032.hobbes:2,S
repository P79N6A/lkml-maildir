Under the GPL Having exclusive copyright just means that you can relicense 
later stuff if you want.  I'm not clear on why FSF considers it so important
but for Linux it just means that nobody, not even Linus, can ever release
under a new license (e.g., the BSD license).  So actually, having multiple 
copyright holders is a good thing for you, it protects your investment in GPL 
capital better.  I say, if Microsoft employees want to contribute to Linux, 
the more the merrier.  Heck, even billg is going to wake up on day (with a 
start, in the middle of the night) and realize which way the wind is blowing. 
Steve Jobs did.
