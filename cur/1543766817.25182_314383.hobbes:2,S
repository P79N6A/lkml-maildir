To the mount owner the semantics are quite normal.  Others will be
denied access to the mountpoint, which doesn't introduce any new
semantics either.
If you look at it from the POV of _any_ process, there are NO NEW
SEMANTICS.  Nothing that programs, scripts or anything has to be
modified for.  Nothing that could cause _any_ problems later, if this
check was removed.
Prove me wrong!
Thanks,
Miklos
