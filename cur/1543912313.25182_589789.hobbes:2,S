Subject: [PATCH] Fix lguest page-pinning logic ("lguest: bad stack page 0xc057a000")
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2007/8/29/218

If the stack pointer is 0xc057a000, then the first stack page is at
0xc0579000 (the stack pointer is decremented before use).  Not
calculating this correctly caused guests with CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC=y
to be killed with a "bad stack page" message: the initial kernel stack
was just proceeding the .smp_locks section which
CONFIG_DEBUG_PAGEALLOC marks read-only when freeing.
Thanks to Frederik Deweerdt for the bug report!
