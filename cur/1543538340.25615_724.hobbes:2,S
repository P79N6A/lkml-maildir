The good news is that, except for statistical flukes, the on-disk journal
will not be complete (i.e. no valid end transaction record), so the garbage
will not make it from the journal into the filesystem on recovery.  This
means that ext3 is safe from such problems, including the data as long as
ext3 also is journalling data.
Cheers, Andreas
