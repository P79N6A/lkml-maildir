Um, slight ~objection.
What's the difference between one tester running a make -j10 and 10 
students compiling their assignments in a multiuser box?  I test throughput 
with make -j30 on a 128Mb 500Mhz PIII, because I know for a very very many 
times measured fact that the box can handle this (heavy but _not_ extreme) 
load.  It's not the only load in the world, but it's such a dead simple 
load that the kernel dare not have difficulty with it IMHO.
