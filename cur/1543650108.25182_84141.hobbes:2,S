Try it:
    % cat Makefile 
    foo: bar
            touch foo
    frob: foo
            sleep 10
            touch frob
    % rm foo bar frob
    % touch bar
    % make frob      
    touch foo
    sleep 10
    touch frob
    % make frob
    make: `frob' is up to date.
No problem with this case.

make is not that broken.  (Well, according to one post I googled, it
was in 1970, but it was noticed and fixed, and the fixed behavior
has long been standardized.)

I grant that second-resolution timestamps are broken.  But you seem
to misunderstand how make works--the current problem is not that
severe.  Whereas your change introduces a different problem that (in
my estimation) is more likely to appear, and will cause mare pain.
I'm saying you're replacing a problem (bad graularity) that
    - is well known
    - is intuitive
    - doesn't cause severe problems in practice (or at least, nobody
      has provided an example)
with one (timestamps jumping at unpredictable times) that
    - is obscure
    - requires knowledge of kernel internals to understand
    - will bite people (I claim, and have provided a concrete
      example)
    - will be wickedly hard to reproduce and diagnose

If that is the point, why not leave the behavior unchanged for other
filesystems?  (Other than that it would be a bit more work.)
Doesn't it make sense, on general principles, to be conservative?

If that were true, I would agree that it's probably not an issue in
practice.  But unless I misunderstand, in the example I gave, the
flush and reload of foo.o can happen any time between the first and
second builds, which could be arbitrarily far apart.  So I believe
it's a fairly plausible scenario.
Anyway, this isn't the biggest deal in the world.  Maybe I'm wrong
and nobody will ever notice.  But it doesn't seem like a good risk
to take.
