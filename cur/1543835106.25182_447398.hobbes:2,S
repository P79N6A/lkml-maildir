Well, that's certainly one inflammatory way to put it.  I would describe
it as suggesting that the kevents collection interface not lose the
nicer properties of io_getevents().

A generic event collection interface that isn't so strongly bound to the
existing semantics of io_setup() and io_submit().  It can be a file
descriptor instead of a mysterious cookie/pointer to the mapped region,
to start.

Sure, so maybe we experiment with these things in the context of the
kevent patches and maybe merge them back into the AIO paths if in the
end that's the right thing to do.  I see no problem with separating
development from the existing code.

I'm not convinced that it isn't possible to get a sufficiently clean
interface that involves the mix.

If we've just consumed a full ring worth of events, and done real work
with them, I'm not convinced that an empty syscall is going to be that
painful.  If we're really under load it might well return some newly
arrived events.  It becomes a mix of ring completions and syscall
completions.
