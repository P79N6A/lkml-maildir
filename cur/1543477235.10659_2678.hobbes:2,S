C++ under linux 101: multiple instantiations in different object files get
resolved at link-time thanks to gnu-link-once, unless you mis-controlled
inline at some point.
and C++ standard trick (hell, it's even mentionned prominently in Stroustrup):
it's trivial to use template specialization to ensure that, for instance,
any List<T*> operation gets implemented thru List<void *>, the List<T*> being
there to enforce type safety.
This is *BASIC* C++.
I'll readily admit that C++ is probably not right for the kernel from a human
point of view. But technically ? Do your homework...  C++ has changed during the
last ten years, most problems that used to exist have been addressed at one
point or another. 
There are techniques being implemented nowadays that avoid code-bloat. The one
I just mentionned for instance. Look in C++ reference texts, for things called
`traits', or `empty base optimization'. These should be standard on almost all
compilers. Good ones such as Kai C++ implement a good enough language that it
can beat Fortran 90 on its homeground, and egcs is getting there awfully fast.
