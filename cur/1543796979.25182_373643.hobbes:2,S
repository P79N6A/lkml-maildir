DCCP is a good counter example, zero --> some functionality is
always preferred.  Our DCCP stack is far from being finished, but
it is in there and getting polished and maintained like everything
else in the upstream tree.
And once it's in there, we can review small patches that add new
functionality not this behemouth "here's the whole thing" jumbo
patch that nobody will want to review.
