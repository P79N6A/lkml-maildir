I will violently oppose anything that implies that the IDE layer uses the
SCSI layer normally.  No way, Jose. I'm all for scrapping, but the thing
that should be scrapped is ide-scsi.
The higher layers already have much of what the SCSI layer does, and the
SCSI layer itself is slowly moving in that direction.
