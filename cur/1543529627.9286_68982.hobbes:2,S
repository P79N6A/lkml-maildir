Not to mention that the change that Riley proposed didn't seem
to work for me anyway.
beastor:/home/tim# unalias -a
beastor:/home/tim# cp /usr/src/linux/scripts/ver_linux .
beastor:/home/tim# patch -p0 < rhw
patching file `ver_linux'
beastor:/home/tim# alias ls='ls -F'
beastor:/home/tim# . ver_linux
bash: /bin/bash: cannot execute binary file
Seriously though, Alan, I think it's useful to see what version
the kernel has been compiled with, so I've written up a patch
against 2.3.51 which uses /proc/version instead of "uname -a"
(provided that you have /proc/version, of course).
I've included the change to use "/bin/ls" instead of just ls,
which seems to fix the weird behaviour that Riley describes.
This is non-Earth-shattering stuff, but it's kind of handy.
Tim
