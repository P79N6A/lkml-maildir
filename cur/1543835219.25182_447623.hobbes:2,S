Here is a better list of the similarities and differences between
rwlock and RCU in -rt:
	Attribute			rwlock		RCU
	Readers block updates		Y		N
	Readers block freeing		Y		Y (synchronize_rcu())
	Updates block readers		Y		N
	Deterministic readers		N		Y
	Readers block readers		Y (-rt!)	N
	Readers preemptible		Y		Y
	Readers can block on locks	Y		Y
	Readers can block arbitrarily	Y		N (SRCU for this)
So in rwlock, priority boosting of readers is required to allow
updates to happen -at- -all-, while in RCU, priority boosting is
required to get deferred free (call_rcu(), synchronize_rcu()) unstuck.

Yeah, this is -almost- as unreasonable as expecting preemptible RCU
read-side critical sections!!!  ;-)  ;-)  ;-)

Seriously, it probably is not all that hard to get an upper bound on
synchronize_rcu() latency, as long as one is willing to put up with the
upper bound being a handful of jiffies (as opposed to being down in the
microsecond range.  In addition, this upper bound would be a function
of the number of tasks, and would also require boosting RCU read-side
priority to maximum.
That said, a (say) ten-jiffy upper bound on synchronize_rcu() would
probably not be what they were looking for.  ;-)
