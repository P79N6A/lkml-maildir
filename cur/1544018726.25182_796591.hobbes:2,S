Well, I tried to get oprofile to work on those machines, but I'm surely
missing something, as "opreport" always complains :
  opreport error: No sample file found: try running opcontrol --dump
  or specify a session containing sample files
I've straced opcontrol --dump, opcontrol --stop, and I see nothing
creating any file in the samples directory. I thought it would be
opjitconv which would do it, but it's hard to debug, and I haven't
used oprofile for a 2/3 years now. I followed exactly the instructions
in the kernel doc, as well as a howto found on the net, but I remain
out of luck. I just see a "complete_dump" file created with only two
bytes. It's not easy to debug on those machines are they're diskless
and PXE-booted from squashfs root images.
However, upon Ingo's suggestion I tried his perfcounters while
running a test at 5 Gbps with haproxy running alone on one core,
and IRQs on the other one. No LRO was used and MTU was 1500.
For instance, kerneltop tells how many CPU cycles are spent in each
function :
# kerneltop -e 0 -d 1 -c 1000000 -C 1

You should ignore the lines init_module, _spin_lock, etc, in fact all
lines indicating a module, as there's something wrong there, they
always report the name of the last module loaded, and the name changes
when the module is unloaded.
I also tried dumping the number of cache misses per function :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 KernelTop:    1146 irqs/sec  [NMI, 1000 cache-misses],  (all, cpu: 1)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are other options to combine events but I don't understand
the output when I enable it.
I think that when properly used, these tools can report useful
information.
