>What's so hard about submitting a 200 line patch to LKML?
that's what i was wondering about ;D
it's not the first time, that i see nice features not being submitted to lkml.
anyway - pavel (thanks btw!) just pointed me to some param "mem=exactmap" :
>I think functionality is there in latest vanila with mem=exactmap even
>w/o patches.
so, maybe we need to find out _if_ and _how_ this could make BadRAM obsolete (i.e. if this is a good alternative) ?
(so we won't need to discuss about BadRAM inclusion anymore. :)
what i found is:
894         memmap=exactmap [KNL,IA-32,X86_64] Enable setting of an exact
895                         E820 memory map, as specified by the user.
896                         Such memmap=exactmap lines can be constructed based on
897                         BIOS output or other requirements. See the memmap=nn@ss
898                         option description.
899 
900         memmap=nn[KMG]@ss[KMG]
901                         [KNL] Force usage of a specific region of memory
902                         Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.
903 
904         memmap=nn[KMG]#ss[KMG]
905                         [KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as ACPI data.
906                         Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.
907 
908         memmap=nn[KMG]$ss[KMG]
909                         [KNL,ACPI] Mark specific memory as reserved.
910                         Region of memory to be used, from ss to ss+nn.
this indeed looks like something being able to replace BadRAM, but the question is, how to handle/enable that and how to translate BadRAM patterns from memtest86 to be usable. (i.e.: writing a HowTo for the average user not being a kernel wizard)

Unfortunately there is no mailinglist to approve this and some "central point of communication" besides Rick van Rein doesn't seem to exist. There is a fork named BadMEM at 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/badmem,
 Memtest86 also supporting BadRAM and i have seen LOTs of discussion about BadRAM on the net. Most of that discussion was due to problems getting it run with Kernel XYZ.
