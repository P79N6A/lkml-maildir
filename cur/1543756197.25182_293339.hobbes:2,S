Thanks for the suggestions. :)
I'm wondering if there perhaps is a more clean way to do this? Perhaps
something that would give the user the possibility to change the
polling interface per device, or something like that, perhaps exported
to sysfs? Though, since you mentioned that the endpoint descriptor
should be considered read only, I guess not.
And oh, would adding other parameters make sense? For instance for
gamepads, joysticks etc.? Also, is there any chance of this getting
into the driver? :)
Thanks,
Mikkel
