ug, I didn't know this.  Had I been there (sorry) I'd have disagreed with
this whole strategy.
I thought the most recently posted CKRM core was a fine piece of code.  It
provides the machinery for grouping tasks together and the machinery for
establishing and viewing those groupings via configfs, and other such
common functionality.  My 20-minute impression was that this code was an
easy merge and it was just awaiting some useful controllers to come along.
And now we've dumped the good infrastructure and instead we've contentrated
on the controller, wired up via some imaginative ab^H^Hreuse of the cpuset
layer.
I wonder how many of the consensus-makers were familiar with the
contemporary CKRM core?

ckrm ;)

Right.  We won't be controlling memory, numtasks, disk, network etc
controllers via cpusets, will we?

That's good.  The controllers are the sticking point.  Most especially the
memory controller.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but a cpuset isn't the appropriate machinery to be
using to group tasks.
And if this whole resource-control effort is to end up being successful, it
should have as core infrastructure a flexible, appropriate and uniform way
of grouping tasks together and of getting data into and out of those
aggregates.  We already have that, don't we?
