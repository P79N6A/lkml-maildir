Doing a quick grep on my laptop seems to confirm that. No actual _PSx 
things found in any acpi tables at all that I can see.
And on a mac mini, there are _PS3 entries that _look_ like they are 
connected to the IDE controller and the realtime clock, but it looks like 
they don't happen for the PCI devices.
But again - I may have screwed that up. ACPI tables are not my favourite 
data structure.
