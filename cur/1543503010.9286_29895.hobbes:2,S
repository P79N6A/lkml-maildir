s/interruptable/indefinately/
Once we're out of memory, you lose. Unless we do something
about the OOM situation, that is. Without memory no task
will be able to proceed and exit gracefully. Well, maybe
it can, but I don't want to wait an hour for my machine to
become usable again.

And how do you want the task to exit gracefully? What memory
do you use to present the user with some options? (we're OUT
OF MEMORY, remember?) Have you thought about the problem at
all?
