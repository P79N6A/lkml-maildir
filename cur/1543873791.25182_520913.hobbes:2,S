Are there really ia64 machines where we need to use the option ROM
copy at 0xC0000?  If so, is this documented somewhere?  I couldn't
find any mention in DIG64, EFI, or internal HP architecture specs.
If we do need to use it, ia64 has a bit of a problem because on some
boxes, the 0xC0000 memory supports only cacheable access, the VGA
frame buffer at 0xA0000 supports only uncacheable access, and the
usual ia64 ioremap mapping is a 16MB page that covers both.
