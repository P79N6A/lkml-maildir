Hugh,
The classical interpretation of the access(2) system call is "do the same
type of permission check as open(2) would do but using real uid in the
credentials instead of effective (or on Linux fs) uid". So, the typical
logic of access() would be:
duplicate credential structure
replace euid with ruid (or with fsuid on Linux)
install this tmp credential in the LWP (or task in Linux)
do the same sort of lookupname() as open() would do
restore saved credentials back
All I am saying is that if open on HP/UX allows writing but access denies
it, it is definitely a bug (in HP/UX). Let's remember why access(2) was
invented at all -- to allow setuid-privileged programs to do permission
checks based on real uid instead of relying on open(2) to fail. This
should make it clear that the two (access(2) and open(2)) should behave
identically modulo the euid->ruid transformation.
Regards,
Tigran
PS. This is the sort of dicussion where openly showing snippets of
proprietary UNIX source code would benefit but, alas, we can't...
