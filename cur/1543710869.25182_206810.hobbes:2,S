For code is that (a) experimental, (b) for pre-production hardware, or 
(c) rarely if ever used, we would prefer to not merge it at all.
When I see stuff like "TODO: actually give this some thought" and "I 
don't know anybody who uses it", that means it doesn't need to be merged 
in the upstream tree :)

It depends on how big the patch is, and whether or not it adds code that 
nobody but the dev team uses, etc...  I don't want to add the WDS code, 
since nobody uses it...  and adding the #ifdefs I removed would not be 
desired either.  Those #ifdefs aren't need in the upstream tree.  I plan 
to remove them from other upstream drivers, too.
WRT submitting patches...   send away.  drivers/net patches should go -> 
Jean T -> jgarzik+netdev or simply -> jgarzik+netdev, your choice.  In 
general "50 small patches are better than 1 big patch".  Large updates 
are not reviewable or easily testable.  Large patches tend to fix 20 
bugs, and add 5 new ones.
