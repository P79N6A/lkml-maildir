Dbench is at its best when half (or more) of the dbench processes
are stuck semi-infinitely in __get_request_wait and the others can
operate in RAM without ever touching the disk.
In effect, if you want the best dbench throughput you should make
the system completely unsuitable for real world applications ;)
There are a few things that are good for both real world performance
and dbench performance, but those are easily dwarved by random factors
like IO scheduling, timeslice length, etc...

Rik
