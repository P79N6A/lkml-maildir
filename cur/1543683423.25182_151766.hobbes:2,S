We only want to check if the resource is in use, not reserve it.  Therefore I 
see __check_region as being appropriate.  As long as it isn't printing a compile
warning, I'd prefer to leave it.  In this particular case it is not creating a 
race condition but for most cases it should be removed.
Also simply requesting the resource without releasing it will cause many of the
drivers that actually call request_region to fail.
Thanks,
Adam
