a) we're now calling try_to_release_page() with a potentially-dirty
   page, whereas it was previously clean.
   I wouldn't expect ->releasepage() implementations to go looking at
   PG_Dirty, because that's not what they're suppoed to be interested in. 
   But they might do, dunno.
b) If invalidate_complete_page2() failed due to, say, dirty buffer_heads
   then we now have a clean page with dirty buffers.  That is an illegal
   state and the page will leak permanently.
   I _think_ that's what the was_dirty logic is in there for: to
   preserve the correct page-vs-buffers dirtiness coherency.  But I'd need
   to do some 2.5.x changelog-dumpster-diving to be sure.
Sigh.  I don't know what invalidate_inode_pages2() is *supposed to do*. 
What are its semantics wrt unfreeable page metadata?  Against page
dirtiness?
It was written for direct-io and had one set of semantics for that, then
NFS came along and seemed to require a slightly different set of semantics,
even though the earlier semantics weren't really defined, leading to a
belief that the present semantics are "wrong", without a definition of what
semantics NFS actually desires.
So let's start again.
Trond, please define precisely and completely and without reference to
the existing implementation: what behaviour does NFS want?
