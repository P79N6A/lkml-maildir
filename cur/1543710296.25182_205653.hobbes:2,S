Will do. I think the profile output I generated was a bit premature. 
I'll wait a few days until the problem resurfaces in earnest and attach 
some more output then.
For now, it looks like the 'pppoe' process itself is waking up ksoftirqd 
the most according to the output of dmesg, but that may change with time.
Will keep you posted.
