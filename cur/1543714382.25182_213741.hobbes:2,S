I am planning to write driver for UART. I have some questions about this.
1. How can I find base address of UART on my system?
2. Can UART also work in MMIO or PIO mode as network devices work?
3. Command "cat /proc/tty/driver/serial" displays port 0x3F8 and 0x2F8. I
also see, these values hardcoded in file serial.c (and corresponding
headers). Is it base address or I need some kind of remapping.

Mohanlal
