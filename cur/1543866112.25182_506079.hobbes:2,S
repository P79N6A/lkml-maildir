This protects the code being used by dev_dbg() only from being
warned as not being used.

Do you have a better way of printing a nice formatted MHz with
fractional parts? Is it going to be necessary to remove this?

I thoguht they where necessary to stop the compiler optimising
away the readl() ?

Yes, these are used by the drivers for the specific function
blocks in the chip.

The current callers are the device initialisation and ioctl() calls
from the framebuffer layer. I expect all the other callers to be from
ioctl() calls (to update device parameters) or possibly from sysfs
file interaction, so I think that a mutex may be okay for this.

Without this the system OOPses when the driver is removed.

I will go and fix this.5~

possibly.
