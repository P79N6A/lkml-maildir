Subject: [PATCH 0/2][RFC] New version of shared page tables
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

I've done some cleanup and some bugfixing.  Hugh, please review
this version instead of the old one.  I like my locking mechanism
for unsharing on this one a lot better.  It works on an address
range instead of depending on a vma, which more closely reflects
the way it's used.
The first patch just standardizes the pxd_page/pxd_page_kernel macros
for all architectures.
The second patch is the heart of shared page tables.
This version of the patches is against 2.6.17-rc3.
