Still not enough of a reason for me to care.
Remember - I'm the guy who refused to merge RH's 4G:4G patches because I 
thought they were an unsupportable nightmare.
I care a lot about future supportability, and HIGHMEM is there purely as a 
temporary wart and blip on the screen.
I did acknowledge that others may care more, but the fact is, I suspect 
that it's going to be cheaper to literally buy and ship a new machine to a 
customer than to really "suppport" it in any other form.
Side note: HIGHMEM64G works perfectly fine with 12GB of RAM under 
*limited*loads*. If your customer does certain well-defined and simple 
things that don't put huge and varied loads on the VFS or VM layer, then 
12GB+ is probably fine regardless.
