It doesn't make any senses. When I specify CONFIG_IP_PNP and
BOOTP/DHCP, I want a kernel with IP config using BOOTP/DHCP. I would
expect IP config is turned for BOOTP/DHCP by default. You can turn
it off by passing "ip=off" to kernel. Did I miss something?

It doesn't work with diskless machines which don't support ramdisk
during boot.
