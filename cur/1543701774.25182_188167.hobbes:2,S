Yep, this is debian testing machiene, and it looks up-to-date (with
respect to testing):
root@amd:~# apt-get install gaim
Reading Package Lists... Done
Building Dependency Tree... Done
Sorry, gaim is already the newest version.
Anyway... I was running as normal user. I should not be able to crash
machine no matter what software I run. (And vesafb pretty much points
to kernel fault).
