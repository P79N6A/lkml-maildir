It's translating priorities through the work queues, which doesn't seem
to happen with the current implementation. A high priority, say
SCHED_FIFO priority 99, task may have to wait for a nice -5 work queue
to finish.. You can set the priority of your work queue, but you never
know what the priority of the tasks are that use the work queue ..

Actually it would be the priority of the timer softirq .. I think what
is desired here would be saving the priority of the task calling
delayed_work then using that..

Yes , if it actively used by higher priority threads .. We could
restrict it to SCHED_FIFO/SCHED_RR tho ..

I didn't touch this particular piece of code, but I'm assuming the
raw_smp_processor_id() is safe giving the rest of the code in -rt ..
