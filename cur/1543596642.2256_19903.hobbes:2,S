Okay, I did some more testing.  I tried doing a reverse patch using
Intels ACPI patch from 2.4.5-pre3 to the current ACPI version.  So now I
was running 2.4.6-ac1 with the old ACPI.  The same thing happened.  So
then I started thinking about anything else I had possibly changed
around the same time frame as the ACPI version change.  I had changed
from the normal UHCI to the Alternate (JE) UHCI drvier to allow me to
use a USB Sun keyboard and mouse successfully on an SMP kernel.  So the
next time that I tried a halt/reboot and it hung I tried showing the
task list using SysRq and khubd goes into zombie state when shutting
down.  Anyone have any ideas why?  Everything else left still running
(all kernel threads) was just in sleep state.  I assume this is a big
part of my problem.  Thanks in advance.
