Subject: [PATCH] Debug shared irqs.
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2005/12/22/72

Drivers registering IRQ handlers with SA_SHIRQ really ought to be able
to handle an interrupt happening before request_irq() returns. They also
ought to be able to handle an interrupt happening during the start of
their call to free_irq(). Let's test that hypothesis....
Signed-off-by: David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org>
I'm not wonderfully happy with the faked pt_regs, but I think it ought
to be OK like that.
