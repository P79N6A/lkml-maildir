Can anyone tell me what the status of the i2c driver in the
2.2.xx kernels are ?
As far as I can see the only two ways of compiling the kernel
with i2c support is to have CONFIG_ARCH_TBOX which is arm 
specific or have CONFIG_VISWS set which is specific to the 
SGI visual workstation.
Happy hacking,
