Subject: [PATCH] CacheFiles: cachefiles_write_page() shouldn't indicate error twice
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/31/99

Prevent cachefiles_write_page() from issuing an error twice, instead forgoing
the callback if it can return the error directly.
Previously, the netfs was being informed of the error twice, once by the error
being passed to the netfs callback, and a second time when fscache_write_page()
returned to the netfs.
In NFS's case, this meant it attempted to do error handling twice, including
clearing PG_fs_misc twice...
