Some of our customers haven't been able to live with it.  I'm really
glad this will soon be fixed in mainline as it means our somewhat less
elegant fix in SLES can go away :-)

md/raid doesn't cause any problems here.  It preallocates enough to be
sure that it can always make forward progress.  In general the entire
block layer from generic_make_request down can always successfully
write a block out in a reasonable amount of time without requiring
kmalloc to succeed (with obvious exceptions like loop and nbd which go
back up to a higher layer).
The network stack is of course a different (much harder) problem.
