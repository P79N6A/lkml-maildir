That would be great. Note that the reversal of the x86_64 quicklist 
support patch does not address the issue that is (as pointed out by 
Siddha) in core code and not in x86_64 arch dode. The fix that I posted 
fixes the core issue.

Any "butchering" was done for 2.6.22. 2.6.23 only added arch support for 
x86_64 since Andi forgot to merge it for .22. I'd be glad if you could 
look into this and make quicklists interoperate nicely withh mmu gather.
