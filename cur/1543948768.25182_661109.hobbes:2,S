yes, but this means you run the soft-3D driver under Xorg, right? That 
is known to starve its clients. The stats you sent show no worse than a 
few tens of msecs delays caused by CPU scheduling itself:
  mrxvt (3730, #threads: 1)
  se.wait_max                        :            18.679129
so the scheduler kept things within the ~40 msecs default latency 
target:
  .sysctl_sched_latency                    : 40.000000
