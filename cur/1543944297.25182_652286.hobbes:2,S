What happens if I ship a binary-only program that uses *either* a GPL library
or a custom library with the same API?  "If you don't have the Frobozz-Foo
library, you'll have to supply your own work-alike"....
(Note that this is in fact the *usual* case - very few programs actually
check that they are linking against a Genuine GPL(tm) library, they just want
the *API*, so providing a work-alike is sufficient....)
