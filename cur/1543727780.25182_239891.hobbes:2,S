Ah, right.

Looks pretty good, but would need rediffing against mainline or -mm
if heading that way: the init/Kconfig patch is peculiar to your -tiny.
The comment at the head of tiny-shmem.c:

Very fair statement.  But isn't it actually supporting /dev/shm fine?
And your shmem_file_setup hasn't quite kept up with the times:
shmat oopses in vma_link because shmem_file_setup is lacking a
	file->f_mapping = inode->i_mapping;
Plus Andi rightly advises externs in a header file.
