Mine, and the original poster? And the "me too?" I understood the author
to say that the new board needed a driver change, and if that's the case
why not hold off the driver until he gets to it? Nobody if faulting him
for lack of time, but it seems not to work.
Guess it must be my hardware, two boards, two systems, corruption only on
the drives on the new... hell with it, obviously if you don't have the
problem the original poster and I must be clueless whiners.
I'll drop this discussion and scrap the board, restores cost more than
controllers :-(
