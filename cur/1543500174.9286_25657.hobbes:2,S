Hi,
I'm going to deploy a server (running linux 2.2.x) to provide file service
for a lot of unix (linux) client. This is a _file_ server only, no print
or other services.
1. What file system would you recommend?
2. What is the pros/cons for each file system?
3. What kernel version should be used on both client & server.
Thanks,
