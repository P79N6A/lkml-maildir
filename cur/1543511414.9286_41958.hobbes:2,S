Hmm, this would probably work for the OS_Out* macros, but for the OS_In*
macros I don't think it evaluates to the result returned by inb(port).
The comma operator returns the correct value, but I am not 100% sure that
it is guaranteed to call the two functions in a let to right order.  I
suppose that the OS_* macros could be redefined as inline functions to
guarantee the proper behavior.
