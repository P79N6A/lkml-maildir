   I had already gone through the PRELOAD user space iteration, but
   there is one big problem. The basic reason that I proposed this as a
   kernel issue was the problem of being able to execute an image that
   is contained within a Meta-File.  Nearly all other features are user
   space issues.
This can be handled using user-space libc hacks too.  You just have to
trap exec, execl, execle, etc.
