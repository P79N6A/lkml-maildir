not sure to understand. The change is exactly to prevents us from
writing non-zero data between i_size and the end of the final bh.

sure I understand this is a best effort. I infact wanted to suggesting
that we could do it only once maybe (it's not guaranteed anyways, it's
up to userspace to do guarantee it, kernel cannot).

Just because block_write_full_page is doing it, so I think Chris was
correct making that change and moving the label. Either we remove it
from both, or we do it in both places. If we remove it we've just to be
careful on how to deal with the _first_ clearing. the prepare_write is
already ok, if the buffer is uptodate then we know we can write it. the
non-bh case needs to be checked and I belive that's the reason you were
doing the thing only for the non-bh case.
the only real fixes are the other two ones, the page_is_mapped move is
just because I agree with Chris it's more correct to do the same thing
as block_write_full_page to get the very same behaviour from both.
