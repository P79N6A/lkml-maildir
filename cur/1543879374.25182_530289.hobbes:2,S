But timing attacks are not exclusive to RSA / asymmetric
cryptosystems. Such (side channel / timing / power measurement / bus
access) attacks are possible against AES, etc too.
Of course, now we're really moving into a different realm -- I guess
in security there is always a threshold, and you really needn't care
beyond a particular threat perception level. I don't see how even the
existing cryptoapi (or *any* security measure in the kernel for that
matter) stands up to the kind of attacks we're talking about now.

I think the original idea was to generate signatures at a centralized
place (not on an embedded system) and only *verify* them using
*public* keys on the embedded systems? For most common
implementations, as I suggested, you only need bother yourself upto a
certain security threshold.
