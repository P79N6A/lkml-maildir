i think you're misunderstanding pike's point.  it is that you don't want
to have threads because processes are too heavyweight, rather you should
make processes less heavyweight.  sharing VMs between processes is a more
generally useful feature and shouldn't be restrained to the notion of a
thread.  needless to say, linux's clone() model is based heavily on pike's
insight and plan9's rfork() model.
