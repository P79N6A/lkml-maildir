i didn't had the time to apply the patches (w26 and C1 from ingo ) 
on a vanilla t11, but i merged them with the wli-2,btw this one has really put 
my box on steroids ;) .
none of them finished a hackbench 320 run, the OOM killed all of my
agetty's logging me out. the box is a 1way p4(HT) 1gb of ram 
and no swap heh.
