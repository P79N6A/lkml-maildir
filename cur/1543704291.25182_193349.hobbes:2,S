The obvious way is to have the kernel headers include the userland
headers, then everything below that be wrapped in "#ifdef __KERNEL__". 
Userland then includes the normal kernel headers, but only gets the 
userland-safe ones.
This sounds too easy though--I'm sure I've missed something, but I can't 
think what....
