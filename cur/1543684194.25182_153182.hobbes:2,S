To clarify, before someone jumps all over me:  look inside
the PCI code, you'll see that PCI as a whole is registered
using the pm_*() stuff for power management.  Yes, when
those callbacks get made, they morph into driver model calls.
Which means that PCI devices (like OHCI) don't fit into the
suspend/resume sequence in the way one would expect.  It
might explain why I'm still seeing two equivalent suspend
notifications in the OHCI code...
