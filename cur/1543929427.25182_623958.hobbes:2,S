They are, although we could easily hook up a couple more ioctls for them
now (if anybody is interested).
The rd driver can potentially be a _lot_ more scalable than the loop driver.
It's completely lockless in the fastpath and doesn't even dirty any
cachelines except for the actual destination memory. OK, this is only
really important for testing purposes (eg. testing scalability of a
filesystem etc.) But it is one reason why I (personally) want brd...

OK, it would be interesting to hear from anyone using rd for things like
cramfs. I don't think we can get rid of the code entirely, but it sounds
like the few downsides of the new code won't be big problems.
Thanks for the feedback.
