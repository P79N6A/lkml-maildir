Thank you!
Looks good to me...so far I've only found one nit.

Because all architectures will share the set of attrs definitions,
would it be reasonable to document the intent of each attr?
Two reasons for doing this:
1) people reading the driver code should understand WHY the dma attr was added.
2) other arch maintainers need to know in order to implement the same attr
   for their shiny new toys.

This statement is really important....but:
Could we add a reference to arch documentation for each attr?
ie something public (doesn't have to be in linux source tree)
which explains the subtlies of how that DMA attr actually works.
Having worked on HP chipsets for 10+ years, I know releasing
original HW docs is often not possible. I'm not asking for the
impossible. Please don't flame me for that. But if the company
is willing to publish the existance of a feature, a paragraph or
two would be good marketing too. Maybe just include comments in
the arch/ code that implements the feature and reference those
comments in DMA-API.txt.

Excellent example.
thanks again for remembering DMA-API.txt.
