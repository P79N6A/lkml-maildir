Just a follow up to all interested parties, if you'd like to snag a copy
of this to test (please *please* :) for me, just reply privately; I didn't
want to attach the patch, because it currently weighs in at about 35k.
Also, thanks to J. S. Connell <ankh@canuck.gen.nz> and the ld man pages I
fixed the whole --defsym / bootsect_kludge ugliness, and it's all been
updated in the latest diff (newboot-2.2.4-2.gz).
