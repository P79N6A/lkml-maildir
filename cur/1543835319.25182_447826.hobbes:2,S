Dear Friend,
I know this email will come to you in an odd manner as 
you have not received any prior communication from me before now.
But 
be that as it may, my name is Edmund Parren Esq. and I was
privileged 
to be the personal attorney of my deceased client who lost his life 
sometime ago.
In the process of my search,I discovered that both of 
you have a similar last name, hence I contacted you so that I can give 
you further briefing on my intention and how to disburse the estate he 
left behind.
I will most acknowledge your prompt response as that 
would enable us to start something immediately.
Sincerely,
Edmund 
Parren,Esq.
