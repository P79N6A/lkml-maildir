That's what I was suggesting - just add -F to the alsactl restore in
your init script.  It won't restore it to a default state - the only
difference is that it will do a better job restoring your mixer state if
new controls are added by a driver update.
alsactl --help:
  -F,--force      try to restore the matching controls as much as
possible
