I can't. I'm haven't seen a really noticeable impact, but that doesn't
tell much:) However, there's no other chance than emulating cmov and
locked xchgs. If glibc/libstdc++ would go back, ABI would break and you
couldn't any longer copy programs build within one distribution over to
another.
So I think I'll diff out the patch and send it for review (note: it was
_not_ initially written by me!).
