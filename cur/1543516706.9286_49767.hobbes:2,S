Documentation/exception.txt is a good doc in how *_user works.

It is also unsafe and racy.
First *_user is an abstraction. It hides the specifics on how the user
space is mapped and accessed etc. from most of the kernel code. You should
not break that abstraction with a (very) good reason.
The other point of *_user on x86 is that it guards you against races 
and bad addressed passed from the user. As soon as you access user mapped
memory the kernel may sleep and schedule in a page fault. While your 
thread is sleeping another kernel thread that shares the same address space
could call munmap on any of the addresses you're trying to access. The
kernel would oops/crash then. *_user handles this case properly.

Even on x86 it may not be safe, e.g. on a machine with SGI's big memory 
patch applied it would not work (because they do mapping tricks in
*_user)

Looks better, although I'm not sure why you're checking for the data segment.
