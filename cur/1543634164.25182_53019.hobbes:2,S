Hey guys.
It`s time for some real janitor work :)
I`ve taken a clean 2.5.22 tree, and started removing
instances of check_region(). It has been on the kernel janitors`
TODO list for a long time. 
It struck me that it might be a good idea to see if anyone had any comments 
or even objections before spending X hours killing it off :-)
I see that there are lots of places where we can just remove
check_region() and instead just check the return value from
request_region(), but I`m also sure we have corner cases where
driver authors are doing 'nifty' things with check_region(), and 
these drivers might need a bit more surgery. I will contact
the driver authors and ask for their comments if I can not figure out
how to work around using check_region() in the specific driver.
When done, I`ll submit separate patches for separate directories.
Does this sound like a sane approach to you guys ?
== Morten
