Hallo. Nice, you are bringing it back. I'll try to have LKML-like
output this time, not a makefile mess and stuff:

All archs, are using same syntax. But.
Interesting exception is MIPS, where tokens are organized and implemented
more nicely, that is where *asm-values* name coming from, actually. One
can see all that text, size, constant tokens in addition to just offsets.
So, if name change isn't worth, then OK; filename compatibility check, as
one in `linux/Kbuild', is easy to hack as well to remove.
But nice feature/tool with meaningful name and functionality is just
another thing.
Opinions?
