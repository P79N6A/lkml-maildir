On my system, modules always load in the C5xxxxxx range.  Obviously not
the case with your setup.  Unless someone can suggest a better way,  I
think kdb is the easiest way to find out what's going on.  (A diag-patch
ala echo pid > /proc/oops would be handy for [really running?] problems
like this one.. but doesn't exist afaik)
