Thank you Roman, this has cleared up a little where you are coming from.
The name issue should never have been brought up, and what you state here
should have been mentioned first. (If you did mention this earlier, I
guess it was just lost in the noise).

I'm not convinced that we are.

If you are only concerned with ms resolution, then the added expense of
precise time is pretty negligible.  And these times are still for usage
with timers that are expected to expire.  Remember that timeouts are still
using jiffies.
As for portablility, I believe John Stultz has some nice plugins coming
to what timer source you want to use, so if there's a better way to get a
time, these should make things easy to add.

Again, the cost is negligible for ms resolution.  And we're getting close
to 2038 so we need to be thinking in 64 bits anyway ;)
I'm not running huge multiuser systems, so I don't know what the average
amount of timers that are used (ones that are expected to expire), and how
much of an overhead it would be for these timers to be using 64 bit
calculations and precise timers.

And they would be if that is all you need. But coming from an embedded
point of view, that is not nearly enough.  I really see HighRes making it
into the kernel soon, and any new code in this area really needs to take
that into account.

And again, you are only limited to 1000 choices to go off in that fraction
of a second if jiffies is the resolution (with jiffies an 1000HZ).
As for the timer_list, you mean a linear list?  If you have a bunch of
timers to go off within a fraction of a second, couldn't a linear list
actually take longer?
