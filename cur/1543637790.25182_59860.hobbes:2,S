That is indeed the question. Right now it will defer, which looks like a
bug. Or at least it is a bug without the interrupt-safe LRU manipulations.
I'm starting to be more convinced about Andrew's alternate patch, the
"move LRU lock innermost and make it irq-safe".
Which also would make it saner to do the LRU handling inside
__put_pages_ok() (and actually remove the BUG_ON(in_interrupt()) that
Andrew had there in the old patch).
