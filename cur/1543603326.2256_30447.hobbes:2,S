500 MHz PIII UP server, 433 MHz client over a single 100 mbit ethernet
using Simon Kirby's udpspam tool to overload the server. Result: 2.4.10
locks up before the patch. 2.4.10 with the first generation irqrate patch
applied protects against the lockup (if max_rate is correct), but results
in dropped packets. The auto-tuning+polling patch results in a working
system and working network, no lockup and no dropped packets. Why this
happened and how it happened has been discussed extensively.
(the effect of polling-driven networking is just an extra and unintended
bonus side-effect.)
