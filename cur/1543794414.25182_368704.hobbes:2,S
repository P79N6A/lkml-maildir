Curious about what progress, what code is available, and what the
timeline/plan is for port multiplier support. I noticed
http://linux.yyz.us/sata/software-status.html
 which mentions some stuff
about Google without much details.
A search of lkml doesn't return very much.
Just curious what the progress is.
