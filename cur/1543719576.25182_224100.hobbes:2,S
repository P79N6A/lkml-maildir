Hi!
I've recently started to follow this list.
I read the swap discussion here, and I was wondering about what Nick 
Pigging said about grepping the kernel tree.

Are the pages swapped to disk as a result of the grep run?
Im still running 2.4.25. And when I do a grep on the linux kernel tree, 
it always takes at least 2 minutes at every run. Almost all physical 
ram, and 21MB of swap is used. Should the files read by grep be cached 
in memory/swap?
