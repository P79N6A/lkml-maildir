The restrictions appear to make it legal for vfork() to have either fork() or
traditional vfork() semantics; any program which can tell the difference has
strayed into areas explicitely undefined by SUSv2.

FreeBSD 2.10-release, BSDI BSD/OS 2.1, and straght 4.4BSD all contain the
paragraph:
    This system call will be eiminated when proper system sharing mechanisms
    are implemented.  users should not depend on the memory sharing semantics
    of vfork as it will, in that case, be made synonymous with fork.
SunOS 4.1.1, 5.4, 5.5, 5.5.1 and 5.6 and 5.7 say:
       This system call will be eliminated in a  future  release.
       System  implementation  changes  are making the efficiency
       gain of vfork() over fork(2V) smaller.  The memory sharing
       semantics  of vfork() can be obtained through other mecha-
       nisms.
As an aside, 5.5 and higher also note that vfork is unsafe in MT apps.
