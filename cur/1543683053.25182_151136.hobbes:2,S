Subject: Switching kernel from GPL

There has been some discussion on the list about the possibility of
getting parts and possibly eventually all of the kernel re-licensed
under another license, which is in the same spirit as the GPL.
Something to note is that even with the consent of all copyright
holders, this may not be possible - there is at least one patent,
(Read, Copy, Update), which is usable in GPL'ed code, but not
necessarily in code covered by another license.  That issue would need
to be discussed with the patent holders.
I pointed this out in a private mail to Dean, (cc'ed), and was
E-Mailed back a large 'confidentiality' disclaimer, telling me not to
scroll down, and read the rest of the mail unless I agreed to the
disclaimer, which mentioned a minimum of $300,000 liability if I
disclosed the information.
I deleted it unread, and would like to take this opportunity to point
out that future mailings including such demands may result in
complaints the relevant ISPs.
Please do _NOT_ send privilaged or confidential information to me
without prior arrangement.
John.
