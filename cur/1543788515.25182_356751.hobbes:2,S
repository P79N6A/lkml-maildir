I had to do the same in i386, but initially I was trying to avoid the
whole situation - allocating per_cpu data for all possible processors.
It seemed wasteful that on the system with NR_CPU=256 or 512 and brought
up as 4x everything per_cpu is (pre)allocated for all, although it's
sure convenient. I though at the time it would be great if
alloc_percpu() mechanism was able to dynamically re-create all the
per_cpu's for new processors, that way cpu_possible_map woun't probably
even be needed. Or is it too much trouble for too little gain...
Thanks,
