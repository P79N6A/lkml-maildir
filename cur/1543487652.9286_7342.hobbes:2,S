Since posting my previous message I discovered that killing mpg123 with ^C
seems to have very bad affects on the driver, while leaving the program run to
the end results in the sound device remaining usable without having to be
reloaded.  I didn't notice this before because I was in too much of a hurry to
get the tests done and didn't completely play a track.
BTW  I'm running kernel 2.2.1 (2.2.2 doesn't even compile for me - sorry I
don't have the compile error messages on hand).

I am in London and would like to meet any Linux users here.
I plan to work in London for 6 months and then I might move to some other
place where the pay is good.
