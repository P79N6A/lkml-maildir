Hello everyone,
I recently got my boss to sponsor me with a leased line.
Since 33K6 without compression isn't the same as ISDN with stac/LZS when
it comes to speed, I tried to find some compression method that is
compatible with both the cisco box on the other side and my linix
masquerading box at home.
Alas, for some reason there is stac for ISDNppp, but not for async ppp,
the predictor module isn't written either, the cisco doesn't support
ppp-deflate or bsd compression.
The modems have LAPM5, which is sometimes an improvement, but it's not the
same as stac.
Does anyone know who is working on this?
Are there any alpha/beta things to be tested yet?
Are there plans to implement just one ppp that works with both ISDN and
async?
If so, it would be much easier to implement compression methods, since
only one hook into the ppp modules would be needed to implement
compression for all forms op ppp.
Also, having a double codebase is confusing and people keep reinventing
the wheel all the time.
ISDN developers could focus on the VBOX app and hardware drivers instead
of working on the compression and ppp stuff, while the compression people
can work on just one module per compression method.
Cheers,
