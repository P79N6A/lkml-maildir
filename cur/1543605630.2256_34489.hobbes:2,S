I'm not absolutely sure about the exact cause of the problem.
It should never break (or have broken) against stock kernels.  The problem
is known in the following scenario:
a) distributor adds dropped-table (from netfilter patch-o-matic) to kernel
b) distributor builds iptables against this patched kernel
c) distributor ships this iptables
d) user installs new, plain kernel
e) iptables no longer working because it was built against a patched kernel
f) user has to recompile iptables.
