That's what I was going to suggest, and it proves that the problem
isn't with the kernel...

That suggests a problem caused by ksh so you might wish to contact
somebody concerned with ksh to get their comments...
I can state that I don't have ksh handy here, nor do I have install
privelidges to install it...

Only those above.
Best wishes from Riley.
