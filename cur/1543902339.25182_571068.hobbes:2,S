With three disks, if everything was perfect yeah 120MB/s writes.  When I 
had started out with 4 raptors I was getting 164MB/s read and write.  By 
default with no optimizations you will not get good speed.
With no optimizations with 10 raptors I get 180-200MB/s, with 
optimizations, 464MB/s write and 622MB/s read.
1. Use XFS if you wan't speed.
2. Use 128k, 256k or 1MiB chunk size.
3. Use 8192k, 16384k stripe_cache_size.
4. Use 65536 readahead size.
These are only some of the optimizations I use.
Justin.
