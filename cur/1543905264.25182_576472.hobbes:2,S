Looking for other users I saw that i386 iboot had included a minimal printf
implmentation which could also be a possibility for alpha.
Now the i386 printf does not support 64 bit - but I dunno if this is
a problem for alpha.
Actually I would prefer the local printf solution for alpha to
keep dependencies on the functions in lib/ as one may expect 
them (kernel only - not boot).
