- How? The only way I can see is by trying them all...

- This is definitely not the case with AFS or any other
distributed filesystem that I know about. I think the semantics
of encrypted filesystems vs. distributed ones are different
enough that you are going to have problems supporting both with
the same tool. Even if there is a key exchange/auth at mount, you
will still require additional per user key information in a
multi-user file system.

- You still don't seem to grok what a PAG is. It's merely a
pointer to WHERE to look for credentials, it says nothing about
how many or what kind you'll find there. You can change
credentials without changing your PAG.

- The question is still "WHICH ONE?" How does it decide? Look at
them all? If you've got two valid ones how does it decide?
- I think you're confusing the current implementation of PAG's
which is admitted a hack a best with the idea of PAG's. It'd be
really nice to have kernel with a sane implementation of
setpag/getpag.
