Ok item #1 you authenticate with the server and get a cryptographic key
for use as credentials. This solves the bad client problem. Kerberos,
gssapi etc will do the job
Item #2 is a bug in our NFS page cache handling. Its not legal in NFS to
assume we can share caches between processes unless they have the same
NFS credentials for the query. The most we can do (and should do) is
that when we think we can reuse a cache entry we issue an NFS ACCESS
check for NFSv3 or for NFSv2 we write it back to the server if dirty
then issue a read for the new credential set.
