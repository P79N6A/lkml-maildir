I am definitely not disputing this point, but it appears the even those
who have changed the gree heatsink with something larger and lowered this
chip temperature substantially are still experiencing the problem
(overclocked or not).  Are you of the opinion that this is entirely a heat
problem?

I noticed regular lockup problems on the 2.2.x kernels when others (not
specifically BP6 users) noticed them.  2.3.x has been quite a bit better,
but my machine is typically not up a week (intentionally) due to other
commitments.
