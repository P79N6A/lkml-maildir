Seems to me that when you get the conf-request in opened state, you
should send your conf-request before sending the conf-ack to the
peer's conf-request.  I think this would short-circuit the loop (I
could be wrong though, it's getting late).
That behaviour would be in line with the FSM in rfc1661, where the
action for event RCR+ in Opened state is "tld,scr,sca/8", i.e. the one
action involves sending both the conf-request and the conf-ack.  It is
debatable to what extent that specifies the order of the messages but
it does list the conf-request first FWIW.
Paul.
