JDK 1.4 beta comes with a way to memory-map files, and various
other I/O improvements (like poll(); see 
http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/51.jsp
).
Chris Smith will have some nio benchmarks up on 
http://www.jlinux.org/
next week or so showing how well their nonblocking network I/O performs.
Sun is slowly getting their act together on the I/O front with java.
Still, the competition from C# and for that matter gcj will probably be 
a good thing, keep 'em on their toes.
(Disclaimer: I served on the JSR-51 expert group, representing the linux 
point of view, kinda.)
