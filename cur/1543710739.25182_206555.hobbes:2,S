Hello,
Here is what I want to do.
I have to test all the functions used by a Linux binary, up to the libc 
function calls.
Thus, I have to provide evidences that the libc (or kernel) function called 
has been tested.
1) I want to know if you are using an automated procedure to test and 
validate a new kernel version.
2) Do you use test suites like osdl.org or ltp.sourceforge.net ?
3) If not, is it easy to test manually a libc function.
Thanks in advance,
Fabien
