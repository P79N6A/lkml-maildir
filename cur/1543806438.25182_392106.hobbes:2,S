yes. It will work Ok.

I have done testing with specJBB, kernel-compilation, specrate and we are
doing some testing with database workload.. I will also request our
perf team to take a stab at this.
BTW, can you also apply this experimental only patch to -mm.

test patch for -mm.. enable CONFIG_SCHED_MC by default in Kconfig.
on systems with no shared caches between cores, this
should help validate domain setup and degeneration code..
