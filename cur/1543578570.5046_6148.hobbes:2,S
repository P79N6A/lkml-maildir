Yes, this demonstrates that spinlocks are preferable to sleep locks for
short sections.  However, it looks to me like the implementation of up()
may be partly to blame.  It looks to me as if it tends to prefer to
context switch to the woken up process, instead of continuing to run the
current process.  Surrounding the semaphore with the BKL has the effect
of enforcing the latter behavior, because the semaphore itself will
never have any waiters.

Yes, wherever the code can be redesigned to avoid long held locks, that
would definitely be my preferred solution.  I think everyone would be
happy if we could end up with a maintainable solution using only
spinlocks that are held for no longer than a couple of hundred
microseconds.
