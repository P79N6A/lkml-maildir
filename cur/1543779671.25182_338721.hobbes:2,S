Maybe it would be useful to once again mention that local mirrors should be 
used at least for stable releases and */testing/*.

patch also nows "-i": patch -p1 -i ../patch-2.6.12
More likely the user will get the patch compressed either with bzip2 or gzip, 
so I think it would be useful to tell once more how to apply such a patch:
bzcat ../patch-2.6.12.bz2 | patch -p1
>+The 2.6.x.y kernels

The better way would probably be to use interdiff. Another goodie is that 
interdiff knows about -z:
cd ~/linux-2.6.12.2
interdiff -z ../patch-2.6.12.2.bz2 ../patch-2.6.12.3.gz | patch -p1
This should only be shown as "another way" to do so. Sometimes interdiff get's 
confused and breaks things, although this is very unlikely for the stable 
diffs.

These two "contain"'s that close to each user are likely to confuse. In a 
German text I would but a comma before "in addition" and behind the first 
"contain", don't know what the rules for this are in English.
