I tried this (or at least as close to this as I can get in my simulation 
environment), and I don't see any problems.  It works as is should; 
however, mount(8) requires that /proc is mounted so that it can read 
/proc/partitions, but that has nothing to do with klibc (or the kernel 
overall) of course.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask for more details...
