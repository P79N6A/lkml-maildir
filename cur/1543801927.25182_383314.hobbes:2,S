And idea what's up with the .data size there?  The first three are almost
exactly the same (as you'd expect) and then the last one jumps up by 40K.
Is there something normally in a different section that goes into normal
.data only in that congiguration?  Might be worth looking at with:
	objdump -h vmlinux | egrep -v 'CONTENTS|ALLOC'
