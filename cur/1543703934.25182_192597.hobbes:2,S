The problem is that allnoconfig turns _everything_ off.
Cases like e.g. CONFIG_PROC_FS=n are interesting, but allnoconfig 
doesn't really test them since allnoconfig also says "n" to all drivers.

I'd like to hear from the people requesting it why they consider it 
useful.
In my personal experience, compiling allyesconfig but with CONFIG_SMP=n 
(which enables BROKEN_ON_SMP drivers), and compiling with gcc 2.95 are 
more interesing (and more realistic) configurations than allnoconfig 
that find many compile errors.
