unless they fix the source compilation problem i reported
<
http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=3343&group_id=68>
then i can't install it
and anyway, can you provide any backup that this will fix it ?? what 
changed between 2.5.66 and 2.5.67 to stop grub loading the kernel ? why 
hasn't anyone else reported this ???
i'm just highly dubious that upgrading grub one revision will help
and it isn't something i can do right now anyway
thanks,
