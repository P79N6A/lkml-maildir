You mentioned, you've got a 400W power supply. But this does not mean you 
have enough (available) current on the 3.3V and 5V lines. Or perhaps your 
Core voltage is dropping very hard every time your "monster" graphics card 
draws a lot of current. Perhaps you should check that (partly possible via 
lm_sensors).
I also use a 400W supply with a TB1.4 GHz and I can see a drop on the 3.3V 
lines every time I start X on a GeForce 2MX...
Salut, Jörg
