I took extra care to prevent just that from happening. ibmebus will simply 
be disabled during the transition (because of {un,}register_driver being 
empty dummies), but the kernel builds and boots without problems. So 
unless you're trying to find an ibmebus-based problem, git bisect will be 
fine. I'll repost 2/5 with an updated description.
I split the ibmebus rework into three patches because the merged patch was 
impossible to read. Makes reviewing easier.
