Half an answer on the "8" and no clue on why it doesn't insert... The
modules.conf file and modprobe.conf file don't agree. Virtually certain
that I must have edited it after it was automatically created. Needless to
say modprobe.conf is wrong, this brings up the question of why it takes
the options from the file instead of believing the ones on the bloody
command line!
modules.conf:	options aha152x aha152x=0x340,9,7,1,1,1
modprobe.conf:	options aha152x aha152x=0x340,8,7,1,1,1
However, there is no change in the functionality, other than the change
from "=8" to "=9" and the device is still not found. Has there been a
change in the ability to share interrupts? I have tried ACPI on and off
(needed =force to get it on) in hopes of a better assignment of the NIC
and/or USB, they seem locked to 9 in 2.6. I will have to get a 2.4 kernel
booted again and see where everything falls with that.
