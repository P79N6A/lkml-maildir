Seems, that's just the broken synchronous firmware loading interface
with the useless timeout handling. The nowait version of the same loader
doesn't time out, and should not have that problem. The sync version
should be removed from the kernel, it just causes all sorts of problems
since it exists.
Userspace should handle the async request just fine when it comes back
running, regardless of the time it was submitted.
