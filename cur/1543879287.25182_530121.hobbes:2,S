Sure. Hence why I say that having hardware set a/d bits are not
required for correctness ;)

I don't doubt that. Do you know rough numbers?

I would be interested to see how it performs and what these
workloads look like, although we do need to fix the basic glibc and
madvise locking problems first.
The obvious concerns I have with the patch are complexity (versus
payoff), behaviour under reclaim, and behaviour when freed memory
isn't reallocated very quickly (eg. degrading cache performance).
We'll see, I guess...
