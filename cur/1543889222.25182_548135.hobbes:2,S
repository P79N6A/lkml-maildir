Hello!

Yes, I found the reason, it is really fixed by taking tasklist_lock.
This happens after task struct with not cleared pi_state_list is freed
and the list of futex_pi_state's is corrupted.
Meanwhile... two more bugs were found.
The first chunk: results in self-inflicted deadlock inside glibc.
Sometimes futex_lock_pi returns -ESRCH, when it is not expected
and glibc enters to for(;;) sleep() to simulate deadlock. This problem
is quite obvious and I think the patch is right. Though it looks like
each "if" in futex_lock_pi() got some stupid special case "else if". :-)
The second chunk: sometimes futex_lock_pi() returns -EDEADLK,
when nobody has the lock. The reason is also obvious (see comment
in the patch), but correct fix is far beyond my comprehension.
I guess someone already saw this, the chunk:
                        if (rt_mutex_trylock(&q.pi_state->pi_mutex))
                                ret = 0;
is obviously from the same opera. But it does not work, because the
rtmutex is really taken at this point: wake_futex_pi() of previous
owner reassigned it to us. My fix works. But it looks very stupid.
I would think about removal of shift of ownership in wake_futex_pi()
and making all the work in context of process taking lock.
Both bugs show up when running glibc's tst-robustpi8 long enough.
Yes, all this about pre May 8 futexes. Seems, updates did not change
anything in logic, but I am not sure.
