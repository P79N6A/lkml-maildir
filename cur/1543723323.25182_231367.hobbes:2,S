Too many kernel trees.  Someone must have whacked the ameslab tree
by accident, or on purpose, because they got sick of seeing rtas 
messages.  I don't find the RTAS messages to be pleasent, but simply
whacking them is not the right solution.  The following diff is 
between an older tree and the current tree.  If you could re-add 
these lines, that would be great.
