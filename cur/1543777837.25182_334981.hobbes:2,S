Hi Dave, I finally found time to read through this.
Yes, I most definetely like where this is going!

The nodeid, I thought, was relative to a given DLM namespace, no? This
concept seems to be missing here, or are you suggesting the nodeid to be
global across namespaces?
Also, eventually we obviously need to have state for the nodes - up/down
et cetera. I think the node manager also ought to track this.
How would kernel components use this and be notified about changes to
the configuration / membership state?
