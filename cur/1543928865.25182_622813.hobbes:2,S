Not sure if this is related, but thought I'd contribute it anyway...
I've got a Pentium D system (dual core, single processor) and I on some
boots I get "Marking TSC unstable due to check_tsc_sync_source failed" with
some cycles warp between CPUs, while most boots are OK. This kind of
inconsistency seems more due to a failure in the kernel to deal with
differences between boots than with something inherent to the hardware.
I conclude that because basically I never have any problems with the system
once it has booted and the TSC has passed.
From my kern.logs since Okt 26, I get the following data:
2.6.23+cfs:  2 passes
2.6.23.1:    1 pass;   1 failure  (48 cycles warp)
2.6.24-rc1: 15 passes
2.6.24-rc2: 13 passes; 1 failure  (8 cycles warp)
2.6.24-rc3:  5 passes; 3 failures (8, 8 and 16 cycles warp)
Note that this is not a new issue. For 2.6.21/2.6.23-RCx kernels I reported
similar data in 
http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/9/16/45.
Cheers,
