Subject: [PATCH] Use ARRAY_SIZE() macro in i386 relocs.c file
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
X-Lkml-Link: https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/12/17/93

  Change the explicit code in the relocs.c file to use ARRAY_SIZE()
and add a definition of ARRAY_SIZE() since this is a userspace program
and wouldn't include kernel.h.

  As Randy Dunlap pointed out, the relocs.c file is a userspace
file and wouldn't include kernel.h so it should be fixed manually to
use ARRAY_SIZE().
  I'm submitting this patch for that single file simply because this
file represents the *single* exception to being able to globally make
the change throughout the entire source tree, so taking this file out
of the equation means I don't have to constantly treat it as the
exception, if that's all right.
