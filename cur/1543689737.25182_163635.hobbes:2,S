Why enable a slow path case that will make the system less reliable?

Sure you can do things like that but then you can't call EFI in physical
address mode.
set_virtual_address_space is unnecessary, on a slow path, tricky to
test, and potentially bug prone.  
Please just deprecate set_virtual_address please.

Bumping the minor revision indicates new features are present.
You added new features therefore the minor rev needs to be bumped.

The joy of x86.  And no you don't need to look for holes all you need to
do is to append to the end.

Which is a reasonable way to go.

If you want a clean slate a sub arch looks necessary.  If you want to 
coexist with the legacy you need to put of with the issues of being
compatible.
But realize you will also want to know you started from efi even if
you were loaded in pcbios compatibility mode with lilo or grub.  So
this is not a boolean kind of thing EFI or no EFI.  It is does my BIOS
have the EFI features.  At least on x86.  And at that point you
probably want EFI detection in Setup.S.

Except when you are directly loading vmlinux you don't have the information
to populate kernel_start and kernel_size properly.  And at that point
you are missing other interesting parts of the kernel.  Like which
boot protocol it supports.
The x86 boot protocol is crusty and has plenty of warts but it works.
Just having a length and no version number or any other way to detect
features is worse, and that is what you are proposing in the EFI case.
Things change and evolve.  So far I know of two distinct versions of
EFI.  The EFI that has been so nicely described by Mark Doran.  And
the version I have actually used with is quite a different animal.
