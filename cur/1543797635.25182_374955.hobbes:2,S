When booting this kernel with  vga=791 like I normally do, the kernel
hangs on boot. Booting with vga=normal works just fine.
I don't have very much info since as soon as the videomode is switched
I get a small rectangle of messed up colours in the top left corner of
the screen (the rest is just black) and then it hangs - even the
keyboard is dead, I have to powercycle the machine.
Nothing makes it to the logs and I don't have a second machine atm to
get logs via serial console or netconsole.
I've got the vesafb driver build in, none of the other fb drivers.
