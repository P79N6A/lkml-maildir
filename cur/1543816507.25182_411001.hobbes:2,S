it's nice that you picked this one;
for this you want an arch-generic/stddef32.h and stddef64.h
and have arch-foo just only include the proper generic one..
(and... why do you prefix these with _KABI? that's a mistake imo. Don't
both with that. Really. Either these need exporting to userspace, but
then either use __ as prefix or don't use a prefix. But KABI.. No.)
