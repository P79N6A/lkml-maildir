Something I've been meaning to do for ages as well. I figure the
simplest way is to define a simple set of profiles, ala
enum {
        BLK_QUEUE_TYPE_HD,
        BLK_QUEUE_TYPE_SS,
        BLK_QUEUE_TYPE_CDROM,
};
Make BLK_QUEUE_TYPE_HD the default setting, and then let setting of this
look something ala:
        q = blk_init_queue(rfn, lock);
        blk_set_queue_type(q, BLK_QUEUE_TYPE_SS);
        ...
and be done with it.

Sounds like too much work for little (or zero) benefit. The current
heuristics are a little rough, and if you can show a tangible benefit
from actually looking/calculating this stuff, then we can talk :-)

Trade off, if the next io is mergable it will still be a loss. But
generally I like the idea!
