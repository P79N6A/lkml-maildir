Yes, it is right solution, but I do not think generic connector should
have it.
Create your own module that will "depend on CONNECTOR=y", which will
register
callback and export some function that will be called from do_fork() if
FORK_CONNECTOR is defined and do nothing otherwise.
I think you even need to create some simple protocol over connector,
i.e.:
void cn_fork_callback(void *data)
{
	struct cn_msg *msg = (struct cn_msg *)data;
	if (msg->len != sizeof(cn_fork_enable))
		return;
           memcpy(&cn_fork_enable, msg->data, sizeof(cn_fork_enable));
}
And register cn_for_callback() with the connector.
By default cn_fork_enable is zero and fork_connector() called from
do_fork()
will do nothing, otherwise cn_netlink_send(data, 0);
Since something is registered with connector then "0" here will select
appropriate group.
Or you may still use CN_IDX_FORK.
Userspace daemod, which is bound to the CN_IDX_FORK group will send
cn_msg with the appropriate
enable/disable message.
Or you can even create more complex protocol, which will enable/disable
various fork parameters to be logged...
