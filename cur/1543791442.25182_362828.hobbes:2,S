On ARM, where we have I2C RTCs, I tend to leave xtime well alone in
time_init and just setup the timer.  When i2c is initialised, and
the bus and RTC have been detected, I set the time from them at
that point.
I haven't seen any problems with this approach.  In fact, I'd
rather time_init() just setup the timer, and we set the time of
day later during the kernels initialisation.
