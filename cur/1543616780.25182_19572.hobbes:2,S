Priority is currently, and sensibly, by process. A process may run user
code, do sys-calls, or field interrupts both soft and hard. Now do you want to
adjust the priority at every transition?

So:
	get semaphore on slab memory and raise priority
		get preempted by "treated special" app that then

Is that what you want?
