The paper is NOT reporting a collision or attack; it's just reporting
a flaw in a previous security claim.  An attack was claimed to be
ineffective on SHA-2 because one step was computationally very expensive.
This paper shows that it's not all that expensive, so the security claim
needs to be re-examined; perhaps the attack can be made to work after all.
