I am aware of this.

I know how it's done, it's just that in my eyes a stable release is the 
one where you know there's only 1 .... A 2.95.4 package built on 
different days (from CVS) will differ. A 2.95.4 package built on 
different ways from a .tar.gz marked as 'release' will not differ.
For instance chasing a kernel bug is difficult when 1 person might use 1 
version of a compiler and another uses a different version when both 
says 2.95.4, no matter how miniscule the difference.
