A quick search in the archives seems to indicate that something is
missing for removable media support. E.g.

How does one deal with removable media?
I only ask because I have run out of things to try myself. The problem
I see is how to run an "invalidate_buffers" on a disappeared media.
Everything I've tried (2.6.3), from invalidate_bdev,
__invalidate_device, and so on bla has left the state somehow internally
confused to the point that accesses hang in a down on some semaphire,
even though I don't have a down in my own code.
But I could be confused about something else. Maybe the handling
mechanism has changed?
What I _thought_ one used to have to do was
   1) in any open() on my device, run check_disk_change()
   2) the latter will call my media_changed() function, which should
     return 0 for "it's still there" and 1 for "it's gone".
   3) when we reply "it's back", the kernel calls my media_revalidate()
     function, which should complete any internal driver resets and
     return 0.
None of the above includes any destruction of buffers on my part and
(probably/provably) works ok under 2.4. Yet it all goes horribly
pear-shaped under 2.6 in mysterious (to me) ways.
What's up? What should I be doing? The floppy driver seems to call
__invalidate_device() at various points, but I don't understand the
code much.
Which of the various invalidate functions should I be calling, if any?
What happens about rechecking the partition layout, for example?
Principally, I would just like cache and buffers to go away when the
device disappears.
And there seems to be a "negative cache" too. After getting the device
to error, the same read attempt errors again even when the device is
back. But a few inserts and removals stops the driver even from getting
any more requestts from the kernel. They sit somewhere.
Do I have to run the device request run/wait queue myself?
Clues welcomed. Please cc: me (usual reasons).
