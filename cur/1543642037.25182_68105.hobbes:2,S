OK, thanks.  We need to reap those pages up-front rather than waiting
for them to come to the tail of the LRU.
What on earth is going on with kmem_cache_reap?  Am I missing
something, or is that thing 700% overdesigned?  Why not just
free the darn pages in kmem_cache_free_one()?  Maybe hang onto
a few pages for cache warmth, but heck.
