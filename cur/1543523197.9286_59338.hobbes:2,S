O(n) vs O(log n) is not the issue here.  It is how much _overhead_ the
algorithm has.  Of course for some value of n a O(log n) algorithm
will run faster than a O(n) algorithm.  In this case its demonstrably
true that n is higher than the numbers which are practical outside of
benchmarks.  Hence the slowdown for all real-world cases.
Also once you get to these states, the scheduler is not the main
problem.  Cache misses etc hurt you much more than the scheduler, as
everyone has alredy said.

I don't speak for Linus, Alan et al, but I firmly believe that this
patch is quite happily left on a patches website somewhere so that if
you have very long runqueues and you think the scheduler is the
problem, you can patch the kernel yourself.
One cycle more in the common case of the scheduler is one cycle too
many.
