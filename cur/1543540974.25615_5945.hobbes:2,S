What is the best way to go about calling a kernel module's function(s) from 
within the kernel itself?
I have a module which creates a circular buffer in memory, and I want to 
store information from the ide device in it (I just need to collect some 
traces).  The buffer module is operational, and I think I know where to add 
code into the ide section of the kernel, but I'm not sure how to proceed.  
Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
