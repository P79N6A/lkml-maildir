Dear list,
I'm trying to get usb hotplugging working on a embedded system but it
doesn't (seem to) work.  As far as i understand all the documents I've
read, /sbin/hotplug (depending on /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug) should be
called whenever plugging in a device.  I guess I've forgot to enable
something in my kernel configuration but I can't find what went wrong.
 I've tried 2.6.8 and 2.6.12 with busybox 1.01.
anyone any suggestion?
wim.
