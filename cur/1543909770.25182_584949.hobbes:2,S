I believe that kernel interface is not really meant to be operated
on the level that's directly accessible by the end user.
The food chain is a bit different. The human user interacts
with userlevel apps, not with kernel API directly. The userlevel apps
interact in turn with the kernel APIs, either directly or via the
layers of libraries.
The abstrations that's presented to the human use are not necessarily 1:1
reflection of  the kernel APIs. For example, you could program your novel
way of permissions as a  new file manager application that
actually uses existing posix permissions underneath. Your file
manager could check with userlevel-stored policies to
implement the permissions that you describe, without any
changes in existing kernel and existing filesystems.
To expect that posix-compliant kernel will drop its posix
complicance for temporary experiment sounds a bit far-fetched
to me. But   the door for all kinds of experiments is widely
open in the userlevel.
