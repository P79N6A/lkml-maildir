Subject: [PATCH UCC TDM 3/3 ] Modified Documentation to explain dts entries for TDM driver
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org

From: Poonam Aggrwal <b10812@freescale.com>
Modified Documentation to explain new properties introduced for UCC TDM 
driver. Also two new nodes have been added "brg" and "clocks" to configure 
a BRG from device tree.

+   Required properties for tdm device_type:
+   - instead of tx-clock and rx-clock following clock properties are
+     required:
+       - fsl,tdm-tx-clk : This property selects the TX clock source for TDM
+	from a bank of clocks.
+       - fsl,tdm-rx-clk : This property selects the RX clock source for TDM
+	from a bank of clocks.
+       - fsl,tdm-tx-sync : This property selects the TX Frame sync source
+	for TDM from a bank of clocks.
+       - fsl,tdm-rx-sync : This property selects the TX Frame sync source
+	for TDM from a bank of clocks.
+
+       All the above mentioned properties are string type with possible
+       values
+       "CLK1", "CLK2", "CLK3"..."CLK24" and so on
+       "BRG1", "BRG2", "BRG3"..."BRG16" and so on
+
+  - fsl,tdm-num : TDM to be used (1,2,3 or 4 for TDMA TDMB TDMC TDMD)
+  - fsl,si-num :  Serial Interface to be used.
 
+   Example:
+	ucc@2000 {
+		device_type = "tdm";
+		compatible = "fsl,ucc-tdm";
+		model = "UCC";
+		device-id = <1>;
+		fsl,tdm-num = <1>;

+  viii) Clocks (clocks)
+	This node specifies the frequency values for all the external clocks
+	viz CLK1 to CLK24 in Hz.
+
+  Required Properties:
+  - compatible : should be "fsl,cpm-clocks".
+  - #clock-cells : It specifies the number of cells occupied by clock-frequency
+    property. Currently #clock-cells = 1 is only supported and implemented.
+    This property is kept for future in case we need frequencies higher than
+    4 GHz.
+  - clock-frequency : It is a list of u32 values to represent the frequency
+    of each external clock(CLK1 to CLK24) in Hz.Each entry occupies
+    number of cells specified by #clock-cells property(1 for now).
+
+  Example:
+
+		clocks {
+			compatible = "fsl,cpm-clocks";
+			#clock-cells = <1>;
+			/* clock freqs in Hz(for CLK1~CLK24).
+			 * CLK11 is 1024KHz,
+			 * all other clocks unused
+			 */
+			clock-frequency = <0 0 0 0 0 0
+					   0 0 0 0 0 d#1024000 0
+					   0 0 0 0 0 0
+					   0 0 0 0 0 0>;
+		};
+
+  ix) Baud Rate Generator (BRG)
+
+  Required properties:
+  - compatible : shpuld be "fsl,cpm-brg"
+  - fsl,brg-sources : define the input clock for all 16 BRGs. The input
+    clock source could be 1 to 24 for CLK1 to CLK24. Zero means that the
+    particular BRG will be driven by QE clock(BRGCLK).
+  - reg : This property defines the address and size of the memory-mapped
+    registers of the BRG.
+
+  Example:
+
+		brg@640 {
+			compatible = "fsl,qe-brg";
+			/* input clock sources for all the 16 BRGs.
+			 * 1-24 for CLK1 to CLK24.
+			 * BRG9 uses CLK11 others use
+			 * the QE clock.
+			 */
+			fsl,brg-sources = <0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
+					   b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0>;
+			reg = <640 7f>;
+		};
+
+    In the above entry, for BRG9 the input clock is 0xb(decimal 11) ie QE_CLK11.
