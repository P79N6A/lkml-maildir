Actually leaked pages cannot be hot-removed/replaced. So we have to 
trace which pages is removed by MCA.
I think Set PG_reserved and set page->private = Removed_by_MCA is a 
simple idea.

No meaning ? 
Before memory-hotremove, we can guessing whether memory is hot-removable 
or not.
As you say , this is not atomic and not fully responsible.
After failing memory-hotremove, detecting why hot-remove was failed is 
very important.
I think ,when memory hot-remove faild, memory area is isolated until it 
is pushed back by an operator.
We can get a real snapshot of specified memory area.
