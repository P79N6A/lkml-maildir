Copying to LKML.
Gdb can not open a file larger than 2GB. You have got 8GB RAM hence
/proc/vmcore size must be similar. For testing purposes you can boot first
kernel with mem=2G and then take dump and analyze with gdb.
But we need to work on some crash analysis tools like "crash" to be able
to debug larger files.

Kexec has been ported to x86-64 but not kdump.
