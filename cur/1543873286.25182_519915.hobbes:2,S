When it makes sense to share the code it can be shared. That is already
done today. But the existing Makefile mechanisms work fine for that.
Making sense: 
- There is actually a lot of shared code
- The supported hardware is the same (remember x86-64 is only for 
modern x86 hardware, while i386 has a much longer legacy) 
- No ifdefs
