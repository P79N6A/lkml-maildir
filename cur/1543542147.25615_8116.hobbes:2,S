Thanks for you suggestion.
I think I have figured it out.
I was loading the kernel, decompressed, at 0x100000.  That's where a compressed
kernel should be loaded.  My own overzealousness got the best of me here
instead of my traditional laziness.    As it happens, the page tables end up at
0x100000 and so there is some contention for that space.
Interestingly, LinuxBIOS has their own inflate routines.  I've been using there
code as a model so I was planning on inflating the kernel on my own and then
jumping into arch/i386/kernel/head.S   I've been paying too much attention to
their method and not enough to the kernel's.  If you put a bvmlinux.out image
into memory and run it the damn thing just decompresses itself and runs!  It
looks like it panics or crashes somewhere else, video isn't working yet  so I'm
not sure what happens when I let it go but it goes much further and posts the
familiar 0x9a that you see so often when linux runs.
Hopefully by the end of this week I'll be able to bring it up all the way.  At
that point we should have a totally free (beer, NSC owns part of my code but
they give it away for $0 when you sign an NDA) way to start Linux on a National
MediaGX part which is pretty popular for web pads and embedded internet
devices.
thanks again,
Ian Nelson
