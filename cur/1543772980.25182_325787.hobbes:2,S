I'm not merging this thing, at least no all at once.
"size_t" vs. "unsigned int" vs. "int" length comparisons are where all
the security problems come from in the protocol stack
Therefore you should make a seperate patch for each type
change you make and explain why it doesn't add some regression
in terms of signedness issues.
