The people who care are not the ones who are hooked into these discussions;
they tend to be drugstore and supermarket floor managers, etc, or system
integrators that cater to them.  But in my experience the demand is there as
long as obscure companies crank out POS systems, bar-code readers, looms,
die-cutters, anaesthesia monitors, etc, having RS-232 control ports with
"unusual" flow-control requirements, especially since SVR4-and-later based
systems support them.  Here's Kermit on Unixware 7:
