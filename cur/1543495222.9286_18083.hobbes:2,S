Hi all!.
I think that it's very difficult to be a kernel hackers :-)
but it's much more difficult if I haven't got good
documentation. Specially, I need info about the Linux kernel
interfaces (memory, character/block devices, buffer cache,
etc.). Yes, I know, there are "The Linux Kernel" guide,
"The Linux Kernel Hacker's Guide" and "The Linux Kernel
Module Programming Guide", but they all are not enough.
And Linux kernel sources are becoming so large that is too
hard reading a lot of files to begin.
Suggestions?
Thanks in advance.
