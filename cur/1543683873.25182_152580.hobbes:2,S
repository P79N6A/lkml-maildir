The whole point of the NUMA scheduler is to rebalance globally less
often. Now I'd agree that in the idle case we want to be more agressive,
as your patch does, but we need to be careful not to end up in a cacheline
thrashing war. 
Aiming for perfect balance is not always a good idea - the expense of both 
the calculation and the migrations has to be taken into account. For some 
arches, it's less important than others ... one thing we're missing is
a per arch "node-balance-agressiveness" factor.
Having said that, the NUMA scheduler is clearly broken on Hammer at the
moment, from Andi's observations.

That's a drastic oversimplification. It may be better in some 
circumstances, on some benchmarks. For now, let's just get your patch
tested on Hammer, and see if it works better to have the NUMA scheduler
on than off after your patch ...
