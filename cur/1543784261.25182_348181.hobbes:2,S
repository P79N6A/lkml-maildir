Our server has a virtual serial port, but its performance seems to be poor.
It takes 10 seconds to output 4000 characters (from kernel) to serial
console. By applying my patch, its peformance could be improved. ( 0.4
seconds / 4000 characters output), so I think it is useful to use FIFO at
serial8250_console_write function like transmit_chars function. Where
should I correct in order to use FIFO?
