Just for kicks I modified the fast path to use a globally incremented
count to see if it would fix both Win9x problem and my 4K connection
problem and it appears to be working just fine.
What probably happened was the sheer number of packets at 4K connections
without the fast path just slowed everything down to a crawl.
