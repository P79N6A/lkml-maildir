Afaik all but one pci ADSL modems are out of tree drivers and include various
level of proprietary code. If Duncan is not interested in changing its code,
the usefulness remains to be proven.
The codingstyle is broken. Please read again Documentation/CodingStyle,
remove the redundant typedef and the silly comments ("Reserve header space",
Encode packet into cells", ...).
- &page[strlen(page)] in atmProcRead sucks.
- "return" is not a function.
- consider 'goto' to handle the errors instead of deep nesting
- +const atmsar_aalops_t opsAALR = {
  +       ATM_AAL0,
  +       "raw",
  -> use .foo = baz instead.
drivers/net/*c may give some hint.
