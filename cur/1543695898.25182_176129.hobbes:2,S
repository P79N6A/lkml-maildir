No problem ;-)

At that time, I hadn't done the work to create drivers/Kconfig ;-)
The main problem for ia64 is the simulator stuff.  Maybe something like:
if !IA64_HP_SIM
source "drivers/Kconfig"
endif
if IA64_HP_SIM
source "drivers/base/Kconfig"
source "drivers/scsi/Kconfig"
source "net/Kconfig"
source "drivers/block/Kconfig"
source "arch/ia64/hp/sim/Kconfig"
endif
(I guess Kconfig needs an "else" keyword).
(Also the duplication of drivers/block/Kconfig is no longer necessary).

Hmmm... no ;-)  I agree the "select" should probably go in -- we seem
to be infected with ACPI for the foreseeable future ;-(
I imagine these kinds of patches can go into 2.6.1 -- the freeze should
let up a bit by then.
