I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying.
CRTSCTS is to enable RTS/CTS hardware handshaking for the tty, which
is what the modem wants if it is doing hardware handshaking.  Why
should we invent a non-standard option to enable RTS/CTS hardware
handshaking when CRTSCTS is already defined to do this?
