Although it wouldn't have helped with this driver, could you review the 
currently 35 open ALSA bugs in the kernel Bugzilla [1]?
- Some might first require a question to the submitter whether the
  problem is still present in recent kernels.
- Some might be problems in other parts of the kernel
  (e.g. ACPI interrupt configuration problems).
- But some bugs might be bugs still present in recent ALSA.
The Gentoo people are using a pretty easy and nice way for forwarding 
their bugs to the kernel Bugzilla, that would work the following way for 
forwarding Bugs from the kernel Bugzilla to the ALSA BTS:
- open a new bug in the ALSA BTS:
  - short description of the issue
  - more information is at 
      
http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12345
- add a comment to the kernel Bugzilla (but leave the bug open):
    this bug is now handled at the ALSA BTS at 
    
https://bugtrack.alsa-project.org/alsa-bug/view.php?id=23456
You could also do this the other way round if e.g. a ACPI interrupt 
configuration problem was reported to the ALSA BTS.
