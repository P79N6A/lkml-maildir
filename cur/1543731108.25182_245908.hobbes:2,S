the kernel will definantly need the ability to use user-space code to do 
the transformations from one version to the other (if nothing else think 
of the thumbnail version of images, we don't want the image manipulation 
code in the kernel and we definantly want this sort of option available)
the interesting issue is going to be defining the kernel->user-space 
interface for doing the extractions.
