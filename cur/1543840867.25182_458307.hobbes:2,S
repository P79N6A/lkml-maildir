I am not sure if this is a correct approach, kernel should not assume
that the reason why input device was opened is to control the state of
the transmitter. For example one could be happy with hardware toggling
the state but still want to have for example a GKrellm showing state
of the transmitter.
Also please explain how userspace would control the state of
transmitter once KEY_RFKILL is received - there seems to be only
kernel->userspace link, but not userspace->kernel.
I would rather see you implemented a transmitter control framework
that would export couple of sysfs attributes. One attribute would
enable/disable controlling transmitter state automatically by the
driver and another  would allow controlling transmitter from
userspace. Then input device would always deliver events to userspace
(btw, it probably shoudl be switch, not a key event) and it would be
up to userspace program to explicitely take control over.
