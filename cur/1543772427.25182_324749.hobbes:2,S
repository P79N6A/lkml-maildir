one way to make it safe/reviewable is to runtime warn if 
local_irq_disable() is called from a !preempt_count() section. But this 
will uncover quite some code. There's some code in the VM, in the 
buffer-cache, in the RCU code - etc. that uses per-CPU data structures 
and assumes non-preemptability of local_irq_disable().

there are roughly 100 places:
 $ objdump -d vmlinux | grep -w call |
      grep -wE 'local_irq_disable|local_irq_save' | wc -l
 116
the advantage of having such primitives as out-of-line function calls :)

I'm not sure we'd gain much from this. Lets assume we have a highprio RT 
task that is waiting for an external event. Will it be able to preempt 
the IRQ mutex?  Yes. Will it be able to make any progress: no, because 
it needs an IRQ thread to run to get the wakeup in the first place, and 
the IRQ thread needs to take the IRQ mutex => serialization.
what seems a better is to rewrite per-CPU-local-irq-disable users to 
make use of the DEFINE_PER_CPU_LOCKED/per_cpu_locked/get_cpu_lock 
primitives to use preemptible per-CPU data structures. In this case 
these sections would be truly preemptible. I've done this for a couple 
of cases already, where it was unavoidable for lock-dependency reasons.
