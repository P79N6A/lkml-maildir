basically this works under windows (not a good answer i know...)
my impression from talking to the bios guys it is okay for them not to 
configure the non-primary video adapter (read they won't do it).
we do something similar for IB. the IB attached to the master nforce4 is 
configured by the bios and the other 3 are not. Each of these IB devices 
are configured by Linux correctly.
Similarly when the ATI is the primary graphics adapter it is sanely 
configured and the other GPUs are not.
