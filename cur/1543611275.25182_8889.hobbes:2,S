Peter,
That patch is flawed as Jens and I found out the hard way
in the sg driver. The scsi_do_req() can lead to the pointer
chain on the following assignment into q being invalid (in 
the worst case).
The easy fix is to move the assignment into q _before_
the call to scsi_do_req().

This patch fixes the problem for my USB CDROM device. Maybe a similar
patch is needed for the IDE case, I haven't looked yet.
In general, who is responsible for unplugging the request queue after
queuing an ioctl command?
