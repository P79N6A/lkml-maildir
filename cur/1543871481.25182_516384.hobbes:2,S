Actually I wasn't saying that for some workloads mainline will be better. What 
I was saying was there will be some bizarre scenarios where the intrinsic 
unfairness in mainline towards certain interactive tasks will make them 
appear to run better. After fiddling with scheduler code for the last few 
years I've come to believe that that may _appear to look better_, but is 
worse since that behaviour can be exploited and leads to scheduling delays 
elsewhere.

Great thanks!. I've appreciated all the feedback so far.
