If it doesn't save power it's not usable imho.

There are no other users anyways and user space can't use it.
Ok in theory you could add a X86_FEATURE_MWAIT_DOESNT_SAVE_POWER
and check that, but just clearing it seems simpler and equivalent.
What would perhaps make sense is to add a idle=mwait command
line option for this though. So that the benchmarkers who currently
use idle=poll could migrate to idle=mwait. That option would need
to check the real cpuid bit of course again, but that should be
easy enough.
