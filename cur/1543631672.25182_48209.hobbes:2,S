To me, this seems like the best approach.  My solution offends my
sensibilities in that we essentially 'throw away' the hidden
bit information.  However, I am sufficiently ignorant of the
filesystem such that I don't really know if this is feasible,
or if there is even a reasonable place to park the hidden bit
information.
