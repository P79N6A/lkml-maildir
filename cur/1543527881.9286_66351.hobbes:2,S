Subject: SMP 2.2.14/15pre10: fork() fails with -ENOMEM during alloc_task_struct
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

Greetings,
While running each of the kernels 2.2.13, 2.2.14, 2.2.15pre9, and
2.2.15pre10, I have encountered conditions on an SMP 4-CPU machine
where the fork() system call fails to allocate a task_alloc_struct
and returns ENOMEM to the caller.
At the time of the failed system call, there is plenty of memory
(128meg of 1 gig), and certainly another gigabyte of swap (300k
used) at the time of the no memory error.
Other things I have checked are:  
*  there are far less than 512 processes running (NR_TASK = 4090);
*  there is plenty of free memory immediately following the failed system call;
*  there doesn't appear to be inordinate memory leaks in the kernel itself 
-  but how to tell?
I attempted to place a spinlock around the old code that is in
arch/i386/kernel/process.c (which is deactivated in SMP mode
on the assumption that get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL) will return
the correct value) which maintains a small stack of 16 previously
allocated task_alloc_struct's, but thought of certain deadlock
SMP race conditions on the way home that evening, and sure enough -
the machine locked solid a few hours later.
Things I will be trying in the meantime:  
*  change the application to try again to fork "a little later" "several" times;
*  change the application to not abort on a failed fork; 
*  change the application's parent to not abort when its co-routine aborts; 
*  change the application's parent to not need the forking process in the 
   first place.  
These are all work-arounds for what should be a non-error in the first place.
So my questions are:
1.  under what conditions would get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL) return
NULL (no available page) when it appears there is free memory?
2.  other than watching the output of Shift-ScrollLock periodically,
what other ways are there to spot memory usage in the kernel?
3.  'ps -vax' shows interesting behaviour, but the sum-total of
each of RSS and allocated memory are less than physical memory,
and 'swapon -l' shows very little allocated swap.  It doesn't
appear that I am trigger the OOM kill-process behaviour of
the kernel from being overcommitted.  How can I confirm this?
4.  Is anyone else interested in tackling this sort of problem in the
developer community?  The application is a massively multi-player
game. :)
Best regards,
Andy
PS - I read the list via muc.lists.linux-kernel, but emailed responses
will also be watched - assuming I have procmail configured correctly.
