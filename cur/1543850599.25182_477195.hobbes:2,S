I don't understand... I can disconnect the driver if I do on cmdline
        libhid-detach-device 05ac:<id> ; modprobe appletouch .
However then my keyboard is gone.
Of course there is the workaround of building both the appletouch and
hid driver as modules and then loading them in this order ... but I was
hoping to have them fix in the kernel. If this is however not doable we
should mark it in Kconfig and I will have to live with it.
