My patch set was considered for -mm , but was never included. Andrew
only stop considering my set because I obsoleted them.
My patches are almost all cleaning up the interface. Adding a generic
sched_clock is just a by product of the clean up. Your changes just add
more mess/confusion that would need to be handled later.

I don't see a justification for the level of changes your making. Your
making substantial changes to a small clocksource interface so you can
check the output of one clock against another clock. That process is
designed specifically for the TSC and only used by the TSC .. It's not
likely that process would be needed on any other architectures.
So your really just adding a bunch of generic overhead to the detriment
of the interface.
