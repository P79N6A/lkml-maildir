Talk to Andi Kleen; passing such structures using read/write is evil,
because (unlike ioctl) there's no place to put 32/64bit
translation. Imagine i386 application running on x86-64 system.

Hmm, reading file causing side-effects is not nice, either. I can see
some backup tools doing that by mistake. Heh, even I might want to
backup my system with tar, and it should not screw my system too badly
if I forgot --exclude /sys...
Perhaps ioctl is really right thing to use here? read() should not
have side effects and it solves 32/64 bit problems.
