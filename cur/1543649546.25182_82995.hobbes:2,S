Hi,
A new extended ptrace patch is available at:
	
http://www.elis.rug.ac.be/~fcorneli/downloads/devel/exptrace-0.3.1.patch.gz
This one has the PTRACE_READDATA, PTRACE_WRITEDATA and PTRACE_DUMPCORE 
ptrace requests from SunOS along with faster ptrace_readdata and 
ptrace_writedata functions and some other extended ptrace functionality 
I need. It's patched against 2.4.19.
Since some people often talked about it, I thought some will like this.
Feedback is very welcome. Please CC me.
Frank.
