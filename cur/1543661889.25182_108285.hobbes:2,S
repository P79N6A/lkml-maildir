The voyager pieces of this don't provide the smp_call_function_on_cpu(),
since voyager doesn't compile kernel/smp.c, so voyager will break the
first time someone uses the new function.
As a general comment, wouldn't it be better simply to make
smp_call_function an alias for smp_call_function_on_cpu with the mask
being the cpu_online_map?  That way we'd reduce the amount of duplicated
code.
