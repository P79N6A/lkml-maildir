Most of that makes sense, I think the PCI to PCI-E bridge was somewhere 
on bus 0a but the VGA Compatible Controller was definitely bus 02. The 
busses only go up to 0a because I'm using pci=assign-busses. If I don't 
use that, they stop at 12.

I tried this patch but the kernel I'm using with that applied gives me 
the following dmesg: 
http://pastebin.com/f7a01c86
 and the following 
lspci -vvv: 
http://pastebin.com/f3e473a13.
 Are there any other patches 
that claim to solve this? I know it can be solved without patches 
because of that one fluke attempt where it worked - I just had no way of 
knowing which options actually contributed to that success while it 
lasted. The only thing I remember about my dmesg output when I had this 
working was that it did NOT give the "can't allocate resource" errors 
for BARs 7, 8 and 9.
