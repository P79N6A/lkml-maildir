tcp_rto_min() lacks a check-for-NULL. You want 5c127c58ae9bf196 from
the net-2.6.git tree -- so this will be gone in -rc6.

Yup, it came from this last commit in net-2.6 before -rc5.
[ Considering it's pretty core code (and thus the oops fairly easily
  reproducible), I initially thought this must've come from net-2.6.24.
  I suspect lot of testers might hit this, so would be wise to put that
  patch up as a hot-fix ? ]
