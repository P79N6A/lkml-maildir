Actually I was thinking about an IC on your card, something like
PLX PCI9080 chip - i.e. the chip connected to the PCI bus and doing
the DMA transfers (many specialized controllers have built-in PCI
bridge, though).
Could you please state if you are using bus mastering PCI DMA, or
if it is IDE DMA (an IDE hard disk etc) thing?
