This patch contains:
--- linux-2.6.2-rc2/./include/linux/sched.h	2004-01-25 20:49:43.000000000 -0800
+++ 25/./include/linux/sched.h	2004-01-29 23:27:45.000000000 -0800
...
--- linux-2.6.2-rc2/include/linux/sched.h	2004-01-25 20:49:43.000000000 -0800
+++ 25/include/linux/sched.h	2004-01-29 23:27:45.000000000 -0800
Both of which seem to be the exact same patch.
This obviously causes some problems when applying.

This is commonly attributed to the lusers spending too much time talking
with their BOFH. They start thinking their name is "Moron" or "Dimwit"
because you keep calling them that.  -- Toni Lassila <toni@nukespam.org>
