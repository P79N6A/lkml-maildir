Subject: [BUG] Regression in v2.6.28 introduced by: 'USB: skip Set-Interface(0) if already in altsetting 0'

Hi,
In v2.6.28 my usb bluetooth device disappears after suspend to ram:
$ hcitool dev
Devices:
	hci0	00:0D:93:15:D6:E8
$ echo mem > /sys/power/state 
$ hcitool dev
Devices:
$
The problem does not occur with the (older) hci_usb.ko, but only with
btusb.ko.
 
This is the output of lsusb:
Bus 001 Device 003: ID 05ac:8203 Apple Computer, Inc. Bluetooth HCI
Bisecting finds commit 24c0996 (USB: skip Set-Interface(0) if already in
altsetting 0) as the first bad commit, and indeed if I use 2.6.28 with
24c0996 reverted, the bluetooth device survives suspend to ram.
If you need more information/test/etc please let me know.
Regards,
Jan
