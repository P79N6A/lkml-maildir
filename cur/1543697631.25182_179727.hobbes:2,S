Yes but an attempt to read beyond the limits of the physical
drive will provide you with a lot of **interesting** hardware
errors. This happens if the file-system gets corrupt.
And I'm not implying that the software screwed up either. The
software doesn't know if an "extra" bit was set during a write
to the drive. These things happen asd a result of bad RAM, bad
DMA, and other hardware-corrupting things....
So, the first check is to see if the drive can be read without
any reference to its contents. Since Read/Write is usually the
software implimentation detail of a direction bit, if you can
read, you can usually write.
