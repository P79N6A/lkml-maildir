Hi,
 equivalent functionality is now available in 2.6-mm and is referred
 to as 'write mostly'.
 If you use mdadm-2.0 and mark a device as --write-mostly, then all
 read requests will go to the other device(s) if possible,.
 e.g.
   mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-disks=2 /dev/ramdisk \
      --writemostly /dev/realdisk
 Does this suit your needs?
 You can also arrange for the write to the writemostly device to be
 'write-behind' so that the filesystem doesn't wait for the write to
 complete.  This can reduce write-latency (though not increase write
 throughput) at a very small cost of reliability (if the RAM dies, the
 disk may not be 100% up-to-date).
