This is the base frequency of the programmable interrupt timer/counter 
(originally a 8253 I think) that on some architectures serves as the 
system timer but on even more architectures drives the system speaker
with it's 3rd timer.
There are these lines in the pcspkr.c (and the other *spkr.c):
        if (value > 20 && value < 32767)
                count = PIC_TICK_RATE / value;
Thos evaluates the count the timer is programmed to generate a
given frequency (value).
In 2.6.5 this reads CLOCK_TICK_RATE which is definitely not correct
as the system clock is not necessarily driven by this chip (timer 0).
Older versions (kernel 2.4.x) of the speaker driver used a hardcoded
value but there seem to exist at least some strange i386 variants where 
this frequency is not the traditional one. 
So I thought an architectural define was appropriate. Maybe timex.h is
not the best place to put it in.
Bye,
Thorsten
