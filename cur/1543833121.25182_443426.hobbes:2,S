Yes, there does seem to be a little race there.
I think it would be sufficient to do

where the tweak to loop_clr_fd() is just there to prevent loop_thread()
from going into a very brief busyloop.
I'm not sure why it's all so tricky in there, really.  Loop is doing a
pretty conventional stop, wakeup, stick-things-on-lists operation and we do
that all over the kernel using pretty well-understood idioms.  But for some
reason, loop is all difficult about it.  I wonder why.  hm.
