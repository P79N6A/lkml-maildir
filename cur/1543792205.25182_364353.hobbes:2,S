Just to clarify, single-thread process can go to TASK_ZOMBIE state too,
of course. But group leader can't be released (by itself or via sys_wait4)
while there are other threads in the same group.

No, I was wrong. This is not enough. This 'tsk' can be already freed!
sys_timer_create() bumps tsk->usage only when the signal is sent via
send_sigqueue(), it does not do get_task_struct(leader) when the signal
is not thread specific, but goes to the thread group.
