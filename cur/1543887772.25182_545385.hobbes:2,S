I think a hint is the right thing to do, but in the PowerNow! driver
rather than the p states one. How about adding something like this to
the X86_POWERNOW_K8 (and X86_POWERNOW_K7?) help text:
"ACPI support is required for non-UP systems and requires ACPI_PROCESSOR
 to be selected. If ACPI_PROCESSOR is compiled as a module then this
 option must be too in order for ACPI support to be available."
Cheers,
Duane.
