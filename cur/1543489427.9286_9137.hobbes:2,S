Hello,
 after trying to run shaper on 2.2.1 (and reading the ML repository ) I
found out that it was broke in this kernel (it just stopped my machine if I
tried to use the shapper, with ping for example).
Now with 2.2.3, I can do:
  shapecfg attach shaper0 eth0
  shapecfg speed shaper0 33600
 and the rest.
But, I can't create another shaper... if I try to shapecfg attach shaper1
eth1 (or eth0) it just says "operation not supported by device".
I've tried to gather some info on the web, but this module is a little
baddly documented. :) (I know.. you code, and don't have the time to
document).
I'm doing some research job for my boss :) about ipchains, traffic shaper
and  QoS on linux.
What I would like to do: 
 - on top of eth0 create a shaper with 33600 bps.
 - Inside this allow any traffic up to 33000 bps.
 - The other 600 bps (I know I have to create a shaper with at  least 9600
bauds ) will be used exclusivelly to telnet (remote support).
 -Inside the 33000 shaper, I was going to play with the ToS to give priority
to http traffic.
Is it possible ? 
If it is, I would be pleased to write some documentation about this :)
Sorry if this post is not much appropriated to this list.
Thanx in advance,
