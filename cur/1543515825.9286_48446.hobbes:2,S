Good guess, but no cigar. I did not know that you had defined 'writew()'
so I made by own. Here is a snippet from a header file with a bunch
of __asm__ stuff.
/*-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-*/
/*
 *  This copies one word from one location to another without going
 *  through the GCC gyrations where it optimizes away what it thinks
 *  is unnecessary. This is really just "*(short *)dst = *(short *)src".
 */
static void __inline__ copyw(void *dst, void *src)
{
	__asm__ __volatile__(
	"/* copyw */\n"
	"\tmovw (%%ebx), %%bx\n"
	"\tmovw %%bx, (%%eax)\n"
		: /* No outputs */
		: "eax" (dst), "ebx" (src)
		: "eax", "ebx", "memory" );
}

The memory write is really occurring (somewhere).
