Umm, slightly more accurate would be to say that it makes the P4 processor
wait before resuming the loop to give the lock a chance to have been
released.  It makes the code go from a constant busy loop to a check/wait
small amount of time/check again loop.  This in turns keeps your processor
from trying to constantly check the lock itself which is suppossed to have
benefits in terms of inter-processor bus pressure.
