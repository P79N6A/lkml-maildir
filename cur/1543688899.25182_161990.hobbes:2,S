   1. That's not necessary when the virtual addresses are separated
      by some multiple, is it?
   2. The other architectures with incoherent caches set SHMLBA to the
      multiple, and they don't do anything special in
      update_mmu_cache(), so MAP_FIXED can create incoherent mappings.
      Is there any special reason why ARM is different?

It's possible that all of them are buggy, but the write buffer test
doesn't manage to get writes into the buffer with the exact timing
needed to trigger it.  Unfortunately, while the write buffer test does
pretty much guarantee a store/store/load instruction sequence, because
it's generic it can't guarantee how those are executed in a
superscalar or out of order pipeline.

Well, it's good to know it was useful :/
