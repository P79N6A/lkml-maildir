IMHO this isn't worth the efford. Flash is slow and (per kbyte) more
expensive than RAM, so I would'n waste too much time on this if you
don't plan to make more than >10000 pieces of your device. If you care
for power consumption use another architecture than x86.

Use jffs2 for the root file system.

This depends on which drivers you need, how much stuff you need in
userspace and how memory hungry your application is. Running a 2.4
kernel with busybox/uclibc in 2 MB RAM is possible.
