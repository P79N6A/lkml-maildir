No need to look there.
If you see sch a BUG message in your logs, you seems to have bad hardware.

Yeah, Windows crashed on me too (win2k, though) when I tried.
Luckily I bought my as a new one 11 months ago and I still have 1 month of

Who knows. May be people in question silently replaced damaged harware with

Or may be they ustill use windows and blame Microsoft on all the crashes ;)
