BTW, what do you think of idea making the pci.ids base modular ?
I mean replacing data requests from pci.ids base by their queuing requests 
(+ eventually request_module(pci_ids) to process the queue if possible )
The module while loading should process the queue.
I see two advantages of this solution:
- make if possible to use Vendor/Device info when booting from floppy
  (kernel size limitations)
- useful for hot-plugable PCI devices...
What do you think of it ?
