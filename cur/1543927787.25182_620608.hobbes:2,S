But this doesn't change interfaces at all.  It makes modules fail to load 
unless they're on a permitted list, which now requires maintenance.

Is there evidence that this is a problem for us?  Are there any interfaces 
you've restricted so far which are causing problems?

Why do we care what a "really public"?  We treat them all the same, as 
changeable interfaces.  ie.  None of them are "really public".
For example, you put all the udp functions in the "udp" namespace.  But what 
have we gained?  What has become easier to maintain?  All those function 
start with "udp_": are people having trouble telling what they're for?
If you really want to reduce "public interfaces" then it's much simpler to 
mark explicitly what out-of-tree modules can use.  We can have a list of 
symbol names in include/linux/public-exports.h.
I just don't see what problems this separation solves.
Rusty.
