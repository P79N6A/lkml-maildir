We should be able to allow for it with the new a_ops API I'm working
on.
Basically we can pass the page down to the filesystem, and tell it to
attempt to install that page in-place.
The problem is that we can't just put this page here hoping the fs can
take it, becaue it might fail allocating blocks, for example.
Anyway, we can still copy files with 1 less copy than read/write ;)
It is a nifty feature, but I think it is more of a niche than simply
saving that 1 copy, because you have to know that the source isn't
going to be used again.
But I'll try to support it with begin_write.
