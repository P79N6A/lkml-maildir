Those are different, because they select items which are not
user-visible. It's just a trick to avoid having the same thing
implemented in the Makefiles like it used to be. We used to have stuff
like...
	obj-$(CONFIG_MTD_NAND)    += nand-ids.o
	obj-$(CONFIG_MTD_DOC2000) += nand-ids.o
... but now we have those options select MTD_NAND_IDS instead. That's a
reasonable enough use of select. I really don't see any reason for using
it for items which _are_ visible to the user though.

We _are_ sprinkling tons of selects all around the Kconfigs. And we're
doing it inconsistently -- nobody seems to agree on when to use 'select'
and when to use proper dependencies.
I think that "only use select for non-user-visible options" is a
perfectly good rule.

It's something we can do in the tools -- if you want to turn an option
on, you can see what its dependencies are and turn them all on in one
go. In fact that's something which was implemented in external variants
of the tcl-based xconfig as long ago as 1997. I think our new xconfig
implementation now does it too.

No, it was MTD_NAND_CAFE which requires MTD_NAND, and that _is_ within
the same tree. I don't know why you added it to the old monolithic
DiskOnChip driver.

I come across this frequently -- and I just look at the Kconfig file to
see the dependencies of the option I want to enable. It's usually very
simple.
It's got a _lot_ harder recently to turn stuff _off_, as rmk observes.
You don't just look at the option you're interested in; you have to grep
all over the rest of the tree to find the 'select' which is forcing it
on after you turn it off. It's no longer in one place.

No, by arbitrarily throwing 'select' into the mix with no real guidance
as to when to use it and when to use normal dependencies, _that's_ when
we're missing the real problem.
