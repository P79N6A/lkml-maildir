Hi, Herbert.
I referenced the book Linux Device Drivers, it is said that
the work function in workqueue can sleep, that is to say, it only
works in process context, so we don't need the disable the lock
in softirq, which is interrupt context, right?
Please teach me if I missed some obvious things. ;-)
Thanks.
