There has been a very intense thread recently on LKML and linux-pm 
discussing this and several other aspects of the freezer.
You have to be very cautious about locking out device addition/removal.  
Quite often the thread calling the driver core owns the parent device's 
semaphore, which is needed for suspending the parent.  If that thread 
were blocked, the suspend would deadlock.
Instead we should broadcast a notification to all threads which might
try to add a device, telling them not to do it until the suspend is
over.  After that notification is sent and current additions have
completed, the driver core can simply fail further calls to
device_add().

Addition during resume is _not_ safe.  The new device can easily get
added to the already-processed list in the wrong position, so that the
next time the system is suspended the PM core tries to suspend the new
device's parent before suspending the new device.

I had envisioned using SRCU to synchronize existing device additions
with the beginning of a suspend.  down_read_trylock should work just as
well (aside from cacheline bouncing).
Device removal isn't as much of a problem as addition.  We could allow
it with no difficulty.  Failing it isn't really an option because
device_del() returns void.  And anyway, my idea was to have the PM core
acquire all the device semaphores at the start of the suspend -- this
would automatically block any attempted removal until the semaphore was
released.

What with all the sysfs changes, I wouldn't know where to begin
looking.  The idea occurred to me mainly because I was considering
blocking all access to sysfs during a suspend -- the problem being that
a suspend is itself triggered by a write to a sysfs attribute!  
Somehow that write would have to wait for all _other_ existing accesses
to complete and block new ones.

It doesn't shift all the complexity.  The method still has to tell the 
sysfs core that it's going to unregister its attribute and that the 
unregistration has finished.  But this is simpler than the callback 
method we use now.
