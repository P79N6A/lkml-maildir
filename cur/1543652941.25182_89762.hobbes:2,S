We forgot to remove a lot of crap interfaces during 2.5 development.
Let's start a list now so we don't forget during 2.7.
This list is a combination of interfaces which have gone during 2.5 and
interfaces that should go during 2.7.  Think of it as a `updating your
driver/filesystem to sane code' guide.
sleep_on, sleep_on_timeout, interruptible_sleep_on,
	interruptible_sleep_on_timeout
 -> use wait_event interfaces
flush_page_to_ram
 -> Documentation/cachetlb.txt
cli, sti, save_flags
 -> Documentation/cli-sti-removal.txt
pcibios_*
 -> Documentation/pci.txt
virt_to_bus, bus_to_virt
 -> Documentation/DMA-mapping.txt
check_region
 -> Just use request_region and handle the failure
kmap
 -> Use kmap_atomic instead
task queues
 -> work queues
lock_kernel
 -> spinlocks
smp_processor_id
 -> get_cpu
-- 
Revolutions do not require corporate support.
