Don't use the syscallX macros whenever possible; there are all sorts of
portability problems hidden there.  Their primary use is for within the
kernel; any other use should be considered problematic.  The prefered
solution is putting the necessary stubs into libc; if that doesn't seem
to be an option in your case try using the syscall() function defined in
<unistd.h> like:
#include <sys/syscall.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(char *argc, char *argv[])
{
	syscall(SYS_write, 1, "Hello, world\n", 13);
}
