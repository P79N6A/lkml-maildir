I don't think the tty is null there.  It'll be a filp->private_data
being null.
From the trace, my guess is that a file descriptor is being left
with a null filp->private_data, yet its on the file descriptor list
for the tty, and its fops is set to tty_fops.
I'll see if I can reproduce it here and work out what's going on.
However, note the following (and I think this is the crux of the problem):
release_dev is _supposed_ to run under the BKL.  So how the fsck are we
getting into tty_do_hangup's BKL protected region while also being in
release_dev's BKL protected region?  Is it the BKL which has broken?
