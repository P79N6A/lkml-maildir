As slight change here, I was going to use the same .config as 2.6.24-rc8, but 
just discovered that neither rc8 nor final is finding the drivers for my
dvd writer while using libata, so its not useable.  So I've enable a couple of 
things in the 2.6.24 build that aren't in the 2.6.24-rc8.  When I find the 
magic twanger, I'll rebuild -rc8 with it too.
