In recent kernels you _should_ be using ioremap and iounmap for all
MMIO.  See linux/Documentation/IO-mapping.txt.
Since Linus has said he doesn't like version checking code, IMHO the
correct change to the patch above [without actually looking at the code]
should simply remove everything inside the #else...#endif
