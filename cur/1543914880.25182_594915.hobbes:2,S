The point is that I'm getting more concerned about overloading the 
interface with nontrivial information.
Another direction to consider would be to add this information to the help 
text, e.g. choose one syntax for nonchangable symbols and then the user 
can press help to find more detailed information.

sym_tristate_within_range() checks whether the new value is ok and 
sym_calc_value() uses rev_dep to override the value when necessary.

The actual maximum value is then 1.

The variable name is already correct, it's the visibility value of a 
symbol not its maximum. In the case of the "if EMBEDDED" then individual 
menu entries can still be visible, if any child entry is visible (see 
menu_is_visible()).
