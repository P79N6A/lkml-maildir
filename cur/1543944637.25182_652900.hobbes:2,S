I don't see what the problem is.
It is legal to access per-cpu data as early as you like,
it just evaluates to the static copy in the per-cpu section
of the kernel image until the per-cpu areas are setup.
rq->idle should also be zero this early as well, that's
also legal to rely upon
I see nothing illegal in what cpu_clock() is doing, that's
why I fixed the sparc64 per-cpu problem I ran into since
sparc64 was doing the wrong thing when booted on a non-zero
cpu.
