Looking further, I think it was done to match the !is_task_stopped_or_traced()
check in do_signal_stop().
Still, I don't understand why we really need this decrement. The ptrace interface
needs only per-thread TASK_TRACED ot TASK_STOPPED, it doesn't need the completion
of the group stop. We can delay the completion of the group stop, but why this is
bad? At worse, the tracer recieves the extra CLD_STOPPED when the tracee resumes.
And do_signal_stop() probably can s/is_task_stopped_or_traced/is_task_stopped/.
OK, it is better to ignore this patch, I don't understand all implications of this
change. But this all doesn't look very good. Suppose we have a lot of threads and
the task with _TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE does system call. So ptrace_notify() decrements
the counter before syscall, after, and before the return to user-space.
Hopefully Roland can clarify.
