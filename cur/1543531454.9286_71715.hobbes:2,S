Update: I just reproduced the corruption problem in 2.3.48pre4!  It's a
lot harder to reproduce than in 2.3.48, and I could only reproduce it
with all drives in PIO mode (DMA mode doesn't seem to show it).  I might
be able to reproduce it in DMA mode if I wait a few hours, but takes a
few runs in PIO mode as it is before it shows anything (usually).
If I apply the IDE changes between 2.3.48pre4 and 2.3.48 on top of
2.3.48pre4, the problem does not seem to get as easy to reproduce as in
vanilla 2.3.48, so it must be something else.  I will try some other
suspicious parts.
Hmm, this is annoying.  Now I'm wondering if the plugging fixes that went
into 2.3.46 didn't fix everything...
Also, Andre:  I tried filling an entire partition with "HelloWorld" (I
used "yes 'HelloWorld' > bigfile" until the drive filled up and yes
exited with an error) and then tried to reproduce the corruption to see
if it was actually that the drive wasn't writing all of the blocks...but
I didn't see _any_ traces of "HelloWorld" anywhere, just other kernel
file data munged in with the kernel files I was copying.
