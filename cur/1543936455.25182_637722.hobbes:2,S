correct for now.
HOWEVER, and this is the point Linus has made several times:
Just about NOBODY has devices that need the extended config space. At all.
So making this opt-in for devices allows our users to boot and use
their system if they are in the majority that has no need for even getting
close to this mess.

Wanne bet there'll be devices that screw this up? THere's devices that even screwed
up the 64-256 region after all.

THis kind of patchup has been going on for the better part of a year (well 2 years)
by now and it's STILL NOT ENOUGH, as you can see by the more patchups that have
been proposed as "alternative" to my approach.

You're wrong there. Sad to say, but you're wrong there.
