Good catch.

I'm a bit concerned about this. Since there might well be 
'notify_on_release' cpusets all over the system, and that there is only 
one cpuset_sem semaphore, I feel like this 'scaling problem' still exists 
even with:
if (notify_on_release(cs)) {
	down(&cpuset_sem);
	...
Maybe adding more per-cpuset data such as a per-cpuset removal_sem might 
be worth it ?
