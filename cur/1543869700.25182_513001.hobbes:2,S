Well, it the drives break shortly after each other, you lose your data
no matter what is happening.
But if it is just occasional read errors, md/raid handles those quite
well these days, over-writing the bad block with correct data.
Of course write error cause the drive to be kicked from the array, but
a write error on a modern drive means something much worse that a bit
of bad media has happened.
If I wanted raid1/5/6 I would certainly use md no-matter what batch
the drives were from (but maybe I am a tiny bit biased).
