It didn;t look like that.
Really Paul, the GPL is pretty clear on the derived work thing,
and when you need changes to the core kernel and all kinds of nasty
hacks it's pretty clear it is a derived work.
And it's up to IBM anyway to show it's not a derived work, which is
pretty hard IMHO.
I don't understand why IBM is pushing this dubious change right now,
GPL violation and thus copyright violation issues in Linux is the
last thing IBM wants to see in the press with the current mess going
on, right?
