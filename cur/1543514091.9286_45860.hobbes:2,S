Personally, I like /proc/pci.  I have lots of machines on nfsroot and cat
/proc/pci has always given me what I want.  lspci?  didn't work, Oops,
forgot to copy it.  I'll probably never update it if I did.  the kernel?  On
floppy and updated every now and then.
Anyway, noone has seemed to say 'Make it a config option'...
