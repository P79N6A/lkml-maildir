on-board. No specification - it's an old testbox.

What's the best way to see whether the SMBus fully works on that machine?

Correct, i found it via random config testing. x86 defconfig + VIAPRO 
enabled boots fine so it indeed could be interaction between i2c drivers.
I've attached:
 - the bad config - it does have a good deal of other I2C drivers enabled 
 - the good config
 - the bad bootlog
 - the good bootlog

Sure, find it below. [ Hm, why doesnt lspci default to -nn? ]
Anyway, this bug is not a big deal - i can work it around locally by 
excluding VIAPRO on that box. If you'd like to figure out why this happens 
that would be preferred of course, and i can send any debug info you need.
