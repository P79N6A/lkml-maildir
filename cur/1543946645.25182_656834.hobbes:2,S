I don't think this is what we want to use linux-next for.  Linux-next is
really a place for stuff that will pretty clearly go into the next kernel
release i.e. 2.6.26 right now.  If you want to experiment on things for
beyond that timeframe, then a snapshot of linux-next may be a good base.
I will take them when they reach the appropriate subsystem tree and are
ready for integration.
