Unless the call happens often, really often, you'll not be able to 
measure differences.  Indirect jump obviously cause pipeline stalls 
which often, but not always, can be avoided with direct calls.  But we 
are not talking here about huge delays.  And the delays are equivalent 
in cost to a mispredicted branch.  If you have a couple of ifs in a row 
you are likely to incur problems with the branch prediction.  I would 
just use the indirect jumps but if you want, do some timing and see 
whether you can filter the difference out of the noise.
