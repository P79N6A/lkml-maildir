The nVidia kernel drivers are open source. You can get them from
ftp://ftp.nvidia.com/pub/drivers/english/XFree86_40/1.0-2313/NVIDIA_kernel-1.0-2313.tar.gz
the 0.9 serious of drivers were buggy and crashed a lot, earning them a
bad rep. But the 1.0 series are faster and more stable than their
windows counterparts- I havn't had one crash, even with a faulty card
that kills windows constantly.
