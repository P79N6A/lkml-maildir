Hi Jens,
Yeah, I have it lying around somewhere - the patch I sent you awhile
back of an initial version of splice_read() is the last work I did on
this.  Basically, it worked OK but IIRC there were a couple things in
the code that needed fixing.  I also modified blktrace to use splice so
I could use it for testing; I'll send a patch for that too once I get it
working again.  
Anyway, that was ages ago (sometime last year ;-) so I'm going to have
to dig up the code and probably rework it a bit.
Tom
