there's a few more places that tend to cause wasted time, no matter what:
 - list_add(elem, list) order of arguments. It can be mixed up easily, and
   while i know all the consequences every few months i waste a few hours
   on such a thing.
 - kmalloc(size, flags)/gfp(order, flags) argument ordering. A few months
   ago i wasted two days on such a bug - since 'size' was very small
   usually, it never showed up that the allocated buffer was short, until
   some rare load-test increased the 'size'.
we should do something about these. list_add() is hard, while we could
introduce a separate type for list heads, there are some valid uses of
non-head list_add(). But perhaps those could be separated out.
handling most of the gfp() mixups should be a bit easier, perhaps by
detecting invalid flags in the inline section, which is optimized away at
runtime in like 95% of the cases?
