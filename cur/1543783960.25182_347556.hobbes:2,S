	OCFS, the original filesystem, only works for datafiles,
logfiles, and other database data.  It's currently used in serious anger
by several major customers.  Oracle's websites must have a list of them
somewhere.  We're talking many terabytes of datafiles.

	OCFS2, the new filesystem, is fully general purpose.  It
supports all the usual stuff, is quite fast, and is what we expect folks
to use for both ORACLE_HOME and datafiles in the future.  Customers can,
of course, use ASM or even raw devices.  OCFS2 is as fast as raw
devices, and far more manageable, so raw devices are probably not a
choice for the future.  ASM has its own management advantages, and we
certainly expect customers to like it as well.  But that doesn't mean
people won't use OCFS2 for datafiles depending on their environment or
needs.
