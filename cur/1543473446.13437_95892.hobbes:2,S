And just let me say (sorry for the repetition) that NFS is something
important.
I would do the job, but I can't, since
(a) I have no idea about NFS internals
(b) at the moment, I'm happy, if I get other very important things done 
  in time
So please, somebody show up and take responsibility!
(What about Trond ???)
