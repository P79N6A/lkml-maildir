Oh, but the point was getting some easy source of 1's, just like
we have /dev/zero for 0's. This way we could use dd for clearing/
setting/randomizing the contents of the file...
==============
#!/bin/sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=$1 bs=1k
dd if=/dev/ones of=$1 bs=1k
dd if=/dev/zero of=$1 bs=1k
dd if=/dev/ones of=$1 bs=1k
# some random source :)
dd if=/vmlinuz of=$1 bs=1k
==============
