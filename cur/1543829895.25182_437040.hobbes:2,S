BTW, if I add __intidata to dmi_ids array GCC (3.4.4) bitches at me:
  CC      drivers/input/misc/wistron_btns.o
drivers/input/misc/wistron_btns.c:345: error: dmi_ids causes a section
type conflict
make[1]: *** [drivers/input/misc/wistron_btns.o] Error 1
make: *** [drivers/input/misc/] Error 2
I have to declare it as "static const struct dmi_system_id __initdata
dmi_ids[] = {..." for it to compile successfully, but there is a
comment that we should not use const with __initdata. Although I
checked the assembly oputput and const __initdata endes up in
init.data section - exactly where we want it. Wierd...
