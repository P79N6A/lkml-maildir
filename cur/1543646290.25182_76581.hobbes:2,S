Argh, that's a typo.  It should say:
	"remove pcibios_find_device()"
as that's what I did.
That function has been depreciated for some time.  I did look into
trying to get rid of pci_find_device() but that's just too much work to
do right now (and there are a few places in the kernel that seem to
really need to use that function, as there's no other way to do some
fixups.)
So yes, removing pci_find_device() should be a 2.7 thing, not a 2.5
thing.
thanks,
