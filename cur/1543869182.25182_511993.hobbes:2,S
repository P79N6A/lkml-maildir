one question is, what is cheaper, to block out of a read and a write and 
to set up the event notification and then to return to the user context, 
or to just stay right in there with all the context already constructed 
and on the stack, and schedule away and then come back and queue back to 
the primary thread once the condition the thread is waiting for is done? 
The latter isnt all that unattractive in my mind, because it always does 
forward progress, with minimal 'backout' costs.
furthermore, in a real webserver there's a whole lot of other stuff 
happening too: VFS blocking, mutex/lock blocking, memory pressure 
blocking, filesystem blocking, etc., etc. Threadlets/syslets cover them 
/all/ and never hold up the primary context: as long as there's more 
requests to process, they will be processed. Plus other important 
networked workloads, like fileservers are typically on fast LANs and 
those requests are very much a fire-and-forget matter most of the time.
in any case, this definitely needs to be measured.
