What make and model of PCMCIA modem?
Are any special drivers used?
(what is output of /proc/modules)
What resources (IO/IRQ) are used by the device
in 2.6.9 (working) and 2.6.10+ (problem)?
What is the output of /proc/interrupts and
/proc/tty/driver/serial between the two versions?

What applications are running and how are you
determining that there is a stall?
Does the stall persist until disconnect or
does data start flowing again after a while?
Can you tell if the transmit or receive side
is stalling (looking at ifconfig stats)?
