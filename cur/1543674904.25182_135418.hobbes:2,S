I doubt they do a very good job of it. I know of bad cases, even with 
"high-end" hardware. Sure, we can hope that it's getting better, but do we 
want to bet on it.

Yeah. Which means that right now _really_ long starvation will show up as
timeouts, while other cases will just show up as bad latency.
Which will _work_, of course (assuming the timeout handling is correct,
which is a big if in itself), but it still sucks from a usability
standpoint.
Even if we drop our timeouts from 30 seconds (or whatever they are now)
down to just a few seconds, that's a _loooong_ time, and we should be a
lot more proactive about things. Audio/video stuff tends to want things
with latencies in the tenth-of-a-second range, even when they buffer
things up internally to hide the worst cases.
