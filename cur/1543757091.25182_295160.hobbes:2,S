Umm...  Let's do it that way: I'll get carving the sucker up to relatively
sane point and post it again (-bird, that is).  Give me until tomorrow
morning and then feel free to send stuff my way - I'll merge it and feed
upstream when 2.6.11 opens (credited, obviously).
Keep in mind that for endianness patches you *really* need to check on
at least some big-endian targets and both on 32 and 64bit ones.  I've
got a decent cross-build environment (tracking 14 targets now); if you need 
help with setting up something similar, I can help.
