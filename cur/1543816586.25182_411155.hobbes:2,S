I tried to talk to this in my other email, but for emphasis; I'd like  
to do two things:
1)  Preserve compatibility with <linux/*.h>, so that old programs  
still work fine
2)  Cause <kabi/*.h> to work on any distro, and kernel, not just  
kernel released after it is introduced.  In practice this means that  
a distro could just package up the kabi headers and install them in / 
usr/include.  A package that is altered to compile against only  
__kabi_* would be able to use information about which syscalls and  
structures are available in each version to either handle different  
kernels at runtime or have a configure-time kernel version specified  
by the user.

I completely agree.  If you'll notice the patches I submitted were  
quite careful to preserve the exact same semantics for the linux/*.h  
headers, both in the interests of not breaking the kernel _and_ in  
the interests of allowing userspace to still include <linux/ 
types.h>.  IMHO, we should try to get the interface compatibility  
crap _out_ of linux source tree and into a separate package which  
depends only on the cleaned-up interface specification (IE: kabi/*).
Cheers,
