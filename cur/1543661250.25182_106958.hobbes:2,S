Ok. With the latest version you sent I got it compiled and working. As far as I
can tell from short tests it looks good (eth2 is tg3):
           CPU0       
  0:      79344          XT-PIC  timer
  1:       2428          XT-PIC  keyboard
  2:          0          XT-PIC  cascade
  5:          0          XT-PIC  EMU10K1
  7:         81          XT-PIC  HiSax
  9:     387286          XT-PIC  aic7xxx, aic7xxx, eth0, eth1, eth2
 11:      75780          XT-PIC  ide2, ide3
 12:      17740          XT-PIC  PS/2 Mouse
 15:          2          XT-PIC  ide1
NMI:          0 
LOC:          0 
ERR:          0
MIS:          0
To make sure I will let it stress-test overnight and send you the results in
about 15 hours from now on. If everything does fine I will redo with ide2,ide3
on same interrupt, too. Just to see what happens with these Promise things...

Thanks a lot, I'll be back,
