I noticed one thing, and that is that the mach64 used to use software
cursor it seems (I remember wondering why atyfb_cursor was never used
anywhere). It's now using the hw cursor.
Also, I notice with this new code that the random vertical shifting of
the console doesn't occur anymore like it does with current 2.6.0-test8
code. For as long as I can remember 2.6.0-test, and way back into
2.5.5x, this has been a problem with highly active console programs
(mutt, vim, etc...). Good to see it's going away :)
