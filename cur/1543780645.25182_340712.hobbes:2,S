makes sense in general - we should not try to move things around when we 
are under-utilized. (In theory there could be heavily fluctuating 
workloads which do not produce an above 100% average utilization, and 
which could benefit from a perfectly even distribution of tasks - but i 
dont think the load-balancer should care, as load-balancing is mostly a 
"slow" mechanism.)
Again, 2.6.14 stuff.
