Hi,
Is there any guaranted way to kill kernel threads
started from loadable modules. I've written a kernel
module that starts 8 kernel threads and sometimes one
of them goes into uninterruptible sleep. Is there
anyway to flush away such threads while unloading
modules.
I've tried using kill_proc with SIGKILL but it doesn't
seem to help.
BTW, I am using the code for handling kernel threads
at 
http://www.scs.ch/~frey/linux/kernelthreads.html
Any pointers regarding the same are highly
appreciated.
Thanks,
