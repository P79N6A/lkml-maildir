Do we actually need NR_MLOCK?  Page reclaim tends to care more about the
size of the LRUs and doesn't have much dependency on ->present_pages,
iirc.
I guess we could use NR_MLOCK for writeback threshold calculations, to
force writeback earlier if there's a lot of mlocked memory in the affected
zones.  But that code isn't zone-aware anyway, and we don't know how to make
it zone aware in any sane fashion and making it cpuset-aware isn't very
interesting or useful..
So..  Why do we want NR_MLOCK?
