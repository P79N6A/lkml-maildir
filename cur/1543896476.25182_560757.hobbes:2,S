I have often read this message and wondered why no one has implemented 
it yet.  We would love to have such clean features instead of O_DIRECT. 
  At this very moment it's a bit hard for us to do this(given a 
prerequisites learning curve amongst other factors.)  We may at some 
point do it and I'd love to contribute.  What _are_ the issues with it, 
  and is there a technical reason it hasn't been implemented yet by anybody?
Further, is O_DIRECT to raw partition also unclean?
Thanks.
Reza.
