Subject: [PATCH] gadget_serial.txt: Documentation clarifications and new windows driver!

Fixes errors and supports multiple
architectures.Corrected errors and warnings are:
Errors:
(E22.1.1003) Section [SourceDisksNames] not defined. 
(E22.1.1017) Primary revision number must be greater
than 0. 
(E22.1.1110) File "usbser.sys" is not listed in the
[SourceDisksFiles]. 
Warnings:
(W22.1.2111) [SourceDisksFiles] section not defined -
full CopyFiles checking not done. 
(W22.1.2034) No destination dir was defined for this
section. Your driver is being
copied to the DefaultDestDir location specified
(10,System32\Drivers). 
Hello we are Ioannis Barkas (risc4all@yahoo.com) and
Nikos Barkas (doubl3nuts@yahoo.com).
There are some errors in
linux-2.6.21/Documentation/usb/gadget_serial.txt.
After fixing the errors, we thought to add support in
it for newer ms OSes.
We were ...surprised on the first place to see .inf
files inside the Linux kernel!
The original text file contains a windows information
file which is not correct. 
Moreover the .inf file in it has 4 errors and 2
warnings while ours has one
error(the .cat which is commented as the driver is not
digitally signed) and no warning.
We also modified a documentation section referring to
windows 98 as the usbser.sys is not
included in any driver**.cab as the text suggests in
contrast to win Me where it is
supplied. Furthermore, the original .inf was outdated
for AMD64 and IA64 systems as it
was limited to work on 32 bit architectures while our
new one works in three architectures
[supposing that ms supplies usbser.sys in IA64
media-we do not have such media or system
for verification].The driver is suitable for Windows
98,Me,2000,XP,2003,Vista.
    Cc: Al Borchers <alborchers@steinerpoint.com>
There is the patch(we do not attach it as many people
suggest not to do so) from diff -u:
