Good morning,
i havve a problem to support Texas Instrument Card Reader 4 in 1. The device can not be active on linux kernel version 2.6.20 (Feisty Ubuntu). The module tifm_7xx1, tifm_core and tifm_sd was loaded successfully but it don't solve my problem.
Dmesg was printed :
[   67.932557] PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #10:4000000@e4000000 for 0000:02:04.0
[   67.932572] PCI: Failed to allocate mem resource #10:4000000@e4000000 for 0000:02:04.1
And a 'lspci -v|grep Texas' :
02:00.0 FireWire (IEEE 1394): Texas Instruments TSB43AB21 IEEE-1394a-2000 Controller (PHY/Link) (prog-if 10 [OHCI])
02:04.0 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1620 PC Card Controller (rev 01)
02:04.1 CardBus bridge: Texas Instruments PCI1620 PC Card Controller (rev 01)
02:04.2 System peripheral: Texas Instruments PCI1620 Firmware Loading Function (rev 01)
Can problem be a bad ACPI support ? I have a HP ZV 5000 and it is not support ACPI correctly.
Thanks for your help
