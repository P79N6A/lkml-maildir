It breaks with GCC too.  How obvious do I have to be?
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main ()
    {
      unsigned short a = 0xffff;
      a = (a << 1) >> 1;
      printf ("a = 0x%x\n", (unsigned) a);
      return 0;
    }
    $ gcc -o test test.c
    $ ./test
    a = 0xffff
--> high bit /not/ cleared

No.  For any unsigned type as wide or wider than `unsigned int', that
will clear the top bits.  For narrower unsigned types it won't.  For
signed types it is implementation defined.

Your example is wrong.  You've shown `(a >> 4) << 4', which is obviously
equal to `a & ~0xf' for any type :-)
