Unfortunately the module_param_array() macro is not really fungible
into the old MODULE_PARM() macro: in particular the array size is now
implicit.
I could introduce another macro which could be #defined to both, but
for the moment I thought I'd see we get without one.

Not sure I understand?  You'd presumably do it like so:
int foo = 7;
MODULE_PARM(foo, "i"); / module_param(foo, int, 0600)

I didn't change it.  I thought about it, but I think that would just
be neatening for the sake of neatening, which I dislike.
Cheers,
Rusty.
