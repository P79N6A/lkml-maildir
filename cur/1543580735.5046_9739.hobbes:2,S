Unfortunately we lost this ability in the 2.4.0-test series. SYSV shm
now works only on an internal mounted instance and does not link the
directory entry to the deleted state of the segment. 
IMNSHO the new implementation is so much cleaner that it was worth
it. Probably we should fix ipcrm to be more flexible.
