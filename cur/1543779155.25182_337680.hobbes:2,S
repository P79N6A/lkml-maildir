Hi,
I am trace the reason of a segment fault.
I found it is created by a readdir loop by add fprintf
before&after it.
I use strace and get following information:
vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
write(3,
"\3\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\275\4\0\0\0\0\0\0\f\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\275"...,
196) = 196
close(3)                                = 0
write(15,
"\300\\\27A\2\0\0\0\0\0\0\0Hx\2@\0\0\0@`\2\0@\0\320\1@\320"...,
148) = 148
rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, NULL, [32], 8) = 0
rt_sigsuspend([] <unfinished ...)                   
--- SIGRT_0 (Unknown signal 32) ---
<... rt_sigsuspend resumed> )           = 32
sigreturn()                             = -1 EINTR
(Interrupted system call)
wait4(355, NULL, __WCLONE, NULL)        = 355
munmap(0x40a2f000, 4096)                = 0
_exit(0)                                = ?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I am not sure if the segment fault related with
Unknown signal 32. What is the meaning of it?
What does rt_sigsuspend do in these lines?
Thanks for any comment.
gan
