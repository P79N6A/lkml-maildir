Erm, there's a rather obvious flaw in your argument here - 2.4 is supposed
to be a stable kernel with relatively few features appearing in it.  We're
now into 2.5.  We've already seen several people trying to get new syscall
numbers between 2.5.0 and 2.5.1, which is also a relatively short
timeframe.
Lets look at some more realistic timeframe.  These figures are for i386:
	2.2.20	- 190 syscalls, last one is sys_vfork
	2.4.17	- 225 syscalls, last one is sys_readahead
So, between these two stable kernel series, _35_ syscalls have been added.
If we assume this trend will continue through 2.5, then we'll be up to
260 syscalls when 2.6 or 3.0 is out.
