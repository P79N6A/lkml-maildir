I'm not sure..  We do:
#define RELOC(x)        (*PTRRELOC(&(x)))
#define PTRRELOC(x)     ((typeof(x))((unsigned long)(x) + offset))
unsigned long offset = reloc_offset();
...
strcpy(namep, RELOC("linux,phandle"));
Which is basically inlining, yes?

Yes, but doesn't -ffreestanding imply that gcc _can't_ assume this is
the standard library, and that strcpy _might_ not be what it thinks, and
to just call strpy?

We aren't saying this is always a bad thing, but what if we want to turn
off a built-in optimization?  Unless -ffreestanding stops implying
-fno-builtin (maybe we could just add -fno-builtin for this one file..),
this line should be fine.

I _think_ this is option 3 or so that I mentioned in another email.
Modify RELOC so that gcc will drop its assumptions and just do what we
explicitly say.
