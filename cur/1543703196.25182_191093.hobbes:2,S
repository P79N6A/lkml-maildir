	Wow, whose code are we talking about ? Just for your
information (and Jeff will confirm), it was possible to integrate the
VIA driver in the kernel only because I fixed many integration issues,
(VIA was mostly unresponsive), and I don't have this hardware.
	I told you the problem was the lack of testing. Now that you
solved this issue, things will go forward. But, I'm only human.
