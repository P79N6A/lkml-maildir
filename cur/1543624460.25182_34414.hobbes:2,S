Yeah. It was pretty ugly. My brain was caught in an x86-think well. I will
resubmit with serinfo back to 1.0, all addresses in free form as they were
before, proper lines for memory mapped ports (tagged "port:"), and no lines
generated for nonexistent ports.

Kudzu ignores all lines that do not contain "uart", including the serinfo
line. I will ask Red Hat to change pciserial.c to look for "mem" if "port"
is not found and handle them interchangeably, so we can use the "mem" tag
later, and to check the returned values of the string functions before
attempting a de-reference.
Thanks for the good input.
