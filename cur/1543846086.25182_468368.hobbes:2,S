Subject: another ATM bug
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>

The following warning appears to be real:
drivers/atm/ambassador.c: In function ‘amb_open’:
drivers/atm/ambassador.c:1049: warning: ‘tx_rate_bits’ may be used 
uninitialized in this function
The variable is accessed before the make_rate() error code is checked, 
thus accessing an uninit'd value.
