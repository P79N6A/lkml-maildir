Code duplication is a matter of stability. Fix one place, but don't fix
the other and you're heading for trouble, since you start to
forget. Besides, code duplication is unnecessary code bloat and evil as
such, in a kernel in particular. 
This is nothing about ReiserFS in particular, just a general thought.
