This is a very good point, and is something that I'm working on now.  I
would like to be able to able to have multiple fitness rankings (ex. one
that ranks specifically for throughput and one specifically for
interactivity/latency).  Then tune specific genes, that actually
impact that specific fitness check.

I considered doing this in userland at first, but I went away from it
for a couple reasons.  I wanted users of the library to have a lot of
flexibility.  There was also a concern with the extra overhead going
inbetween user/kernel space (important for users who's children have
very short life-spans).
