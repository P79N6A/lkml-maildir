Only for the record, the problem has nothing to do with the OOM patch.
You got an Oops while reading jiffies.
Could you run:
	grep c01c2b40 System.map
You should get as output:
	jiffies D jiffies
The possible cause of this problem are:
o	hardware bug
o	some buggy device driver changed the kernel pagetables by mistake
So my suggestion is to try to identify an "interesting" device driver or
changing replacing CPU/memory (or avoid overclocking if you was
overclocked :). I hope it's easily reproducible.
Your report was great btw :).
