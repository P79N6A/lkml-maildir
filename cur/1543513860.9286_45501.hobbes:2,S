Have a look at

gcc 2.95.x == egcs 2.x

2.3.x currently compiles with gcc 2.95.x. 2.2.x compiles with the Patch at
http://people.redhat.com/bero/.
Some people have reported problems with gcc 2.95.x compiled kernels, I
(and many others) am running 2.95.x compiled kernels without any problems.
Maybe some drivers don't compile right at the moment. -fno-strict-aliasing
should help here...
