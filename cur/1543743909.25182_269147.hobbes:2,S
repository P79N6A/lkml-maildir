Hi,
I have a question about WLAN: how does Linux recognize that it has entered
a 802.11 network? and how does it acquire an IP address via DHCP
automatically?
I've successfully configured the DHCP server and the mobile host to work
together. However I want to know the detailed procesures carried out, such
as how scan/authentication/association is triggered, how dhclient is
triggered?
My machine is a RH9 with kernel 2.4.26 or 2.6.7 (wireless extensions
used), and the wireless adapter is Linksys WUSB11 v2.8 (driver from
http://at76c503a.berlios.de/
).
Any information'd be appreciated.
