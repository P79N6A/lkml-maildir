This is very wrong IMO. We shouldn't try to emulate the RTC interrupt
for the kernel, instead the HPET should use native APIC interrupt
routing. This way the RTC will keep working and the 'legacy mode' of
HPET doesn't need to be used. I must admit I was a bit lazy when I was
implementing the x86_64 variant and the native IRQ for HPET is still on
my to-do list.
