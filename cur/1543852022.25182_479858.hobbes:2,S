One option is having a per-sb counter (to avoid wraps on not-heavily-used
filesystems), and also a per-sb flag that indicates if the counter has
wrapped.  If that happens, it would be possible to do a lookup in the
inode hash for a conflicting inode number, and skip those.  It is more
overhead, but only hit in the case where there is danger (i.e. post wrap).
There should also be a flag indicating if the caller is actually using
the inum supplied by new_inode or not, to avoid the overhead if it just
replaces i_ino with its own value.
Cheers, Andreas
