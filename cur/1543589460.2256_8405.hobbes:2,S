I tried sth. else with 2.4.3-ac13, which could be related:
Machine: 1GB RAM, Dual PIII, ServerWorks LE chipset (Asus CUR-DLS board). 
NIC: [Ethernet Pro 100] (rev 08) (driven by eepro100)
0. Run several kernel compiles and the like to fill up caches.
1. copy an complete iso image into /tmp (which is tmpfs)
2. ftp that over 100Mbit network to an machine.
I got a lot of spikes and a message "mm: critical shortage of
bounce buffers", while doing 1.
And I get a LOT of that messages, while doing 2. But I have a lot
of memory in pagecache and only 100MB allocated for other
processes. And I still have swap free (I have 2GB of swap as
recommended).
So could we please check, double check and triple check the
allocations in the net layer?
Another machine of mine needs now 128MB with the new kernel and
will lock up hard otherwise on full saturated 100Mbit network
load[1] with TCP, but needed only 32MB before. sth. has to be
wrong here...
More info on request. 
I have both machines at hand and they are both ready for testing
as long, as my file systems stay repairable by fsck.ext2 ;-)
Both machines are not running X, frame buffers and no fancy multi
media stuff.

   3c509TX, so I guess it's NOT the NIC ;-)
