ok so this got a lot more involved than I was hoping for;
something like below will help me (and kerneloops.org ;) for the short term,
while I'll see what I can do for random.c in a few dead moments soon, for a 2.6.25
enhancement...
Subject: [patch] terminate the oops printing with a defined string/uuid
From: Arjan van de Ven <arjan@linux.intel.com>
Right now, it's hard for automated tools to determine when an oops has
ended; there's no clear marker for this. For later kernels I would also
like a UUID to printed here, but for short term I've put all zeros there
since printing a UUID seems to involve cleaning up/rewriting quite a chunk
of random.c and that's more involved -> later patch.
