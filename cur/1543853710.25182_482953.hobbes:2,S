I have no personal issues with Intel. I just always avoided their stuff 
because it always cost more and wasn't as well supported in Linux back when I 
first started using Linux.
Anyway, my point still stands. One platform does not a whitelist make. Instead 
why not make the MSI support optional and a build-option? I do believe that I 
even suggested such. This would allow for the people that want it (or need 
it) to have it and would keep a potentially dangerous option from being used.
Now, since I'm at the end of options in explaining my point I'm going to start 
ignoring further messages on this topic.
