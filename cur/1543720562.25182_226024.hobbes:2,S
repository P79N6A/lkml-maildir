Many if not most large machines have sparse address spaces,
so you may have memory at an address that will cause a
problem even if the actual amount of memory is much smaller.
The main point is that I wouldn't want a time bomb that
will silently fail when somebody happens to boot on such
a machine.  Whether that's avoided by a "miraculous" bit,
throwing away problem pages at boot-time, avoiding task
allocation at specific addresses, etc.,  is secondary.
