3 gigabytes of virtual address space.

You don't have enough ram?

That decreases the task size.  The implementation in 2.4. is totally
different from 2.2. and the process virtual address space size does
not change in 2.4.

It looks like you might have a legitimate problem with your database
task, but you haven't provided enough information about it's behavior,
and it's expected behavior for anyone to diagnose what is going wrong
with your machine.
