Read the man page on sched_setscheduler(2).  If in the kernel, you would
need to make a system call.  I am afraid I don't know exactly how this
is done, but it is possible.  By the way, some scheduler patches allow
the real time priority to go well above 99, thus if you need this:
#ifndef MAX_PRI
#define MAX_PRI 99
#endif
if you want the maximum priority.
