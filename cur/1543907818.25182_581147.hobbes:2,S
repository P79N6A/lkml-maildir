Hello,
Here is an updated set of patches that implement Asynchronous Notification
support for ATAPI devices.  In this version I no longer export the AN
capability through genhd, and the uevent is sent by the scsi_device 
instead of gendisk.  I added a generic SCSI device event mechanism so
that it can be expanded in the future with other types of events.  Please
let me know what you think.
Kristen
