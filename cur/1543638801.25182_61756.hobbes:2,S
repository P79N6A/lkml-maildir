Hi!
Please excuse my jumping in, but I have a very similar problem: when
copying data in both directions between the 3ware RAID and the 3C996B-T
GE-card (tg3 driver) the machine will lock up after some seconds. It
happens always in the same spot, BUG in line 1557 of tg3.c (v0.99). I have
also tried the bcm5700 driver (I know, it's unreadable), and this one died
on the exact same occasion, namely that an interrupt arrives to notify a
completed transmission, but there was none queued.
Upgrading to 2.4.19 did not help. Nor did upgrading the PS to 550W.
This happens on a dozen of dual Athlon MP (Tyan Tiger v1.02) machines, the
fs on the RAID is reiserfs. And both directions of data flow (about 10MB/s
each) have to be present to trigger this.
