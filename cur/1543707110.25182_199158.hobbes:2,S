Of course the chances of parallel IDE controllers going obsolete are
higher. Archival storage seems to be more and more of a problem as
hardware improves. I'm copying the contents of my old SCSI hard drives
to CD (they fit), my old tapes to various media, and generally getting
stuff current, but as soon as I stop making the effort I know my ability
to read old stuff will vanish. Try and find devices for 8 inch floppies
or even 5-1/4, and most systems don't come with 3-1/2 any more.
My old "standard" tapes are being backed up on new media, my records and
old tapes to newer media, etc. We are getting close to the point where
we have room to store everything, but can't read anything more than
about a decade old.
Disk drives are cheap, but sensitive to temperature, vibration, magnetic
field, and age. The life of optical is debated, and entropy is winning
quickly. I don't have a solution, but I'm glad there is any working
driver for old hardware!
