I just noticed this in the Changes file
Quota utils
===========
The 1.55 release:
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/quota/quota-1.55-10.i386.rpm
ftp://ftp.uk.linux.org/pub/linux/sct/quota/quota-1.55-10.src.rpm
WHY IS THIS ONLY IN RPM FORMAT?! Please could we have a tarball of the
sources!! I am not downloading RPM just to get at the sources! (Yes, I
checked in the ftp server)
Finally, I think the Changes file should have each particular part of the
system attributed to a specific author so I can email them directly
instead of posting to the list.
Cheers,
Alex
