Too bad I don't still have access to the 0.59 bogomips "double sigma"
386 machine that had the dubious honor of being the slowest Linux
machine in the world for quite a while.  That machine had 3 MB of RAM.
However, to tie it back to the original discussion, these
extremely-low-memory machines need nonstandard kernel options anyay.
While doing my SuperRescue disk I was able to get it down to the point
where I could successfully boot and use the system on a 24 MB machine; I
personally run a 32 MB box as a server today.
