Sure thing. I followed up in the bug, but I don't think the clocksource
code is involved. x86_64 hasn't converted to GENERIC_TIME, so jiffies is
what we use to increment xtime, but the TSC, ACPI PM, or HPET is used
for gettimeofday, etc. 
I suspect C3 idling is the culprit, since noapic works around the issue.
