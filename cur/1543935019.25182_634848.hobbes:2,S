may i point out the obvious at this stage? The thing that finally got 
movement into this bug was ... :
   exposure on lkml
The reproducer came to you via Peter Osterlund who has never authored a 
single drivers/scsi/ commit before (according to git-log) and who (and 
here i'm out on a limb guessing it) does not even follow 
linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org.
this bug was obscure and hidden on linux-scsi@vger.kernel.org for 
_months_, (it is a rarely visited and rarely read mailing list) and 
there was just not enough "critical mass" to get this issue fixed.
_THAT_ is the power of lkml. People who are not generally interested in 
your subsystem come and help. There is extra noise, but it's manageable.
so may i at this point suggest that you as the SCSI maintainer start 
reading SCSI bugreports on lkml and start participating in SCSI topics 
there, without extra prompting? It _is_ an important aggregation mailing 
list for development, just like -mm or the upstream kernel is an 
aggregation point of all things Linux.
I believe the "I only read linux-scsi, please post bugs there" approach 
is harmful. If lkml traffic is too big then i'd suggest to set up email 
filters to separate out mails that have 'SCSI' in their subject line or 
body. Fortunately it's a really easy key to filter on. [ Scheduler mails 
are much harder to filter out :-/ ] In fact i'd suggest to do all SCSI 
development on lkml. We've got one upstream kernel codebase, one git 
stream of commits and hence we should use one lkml feed to discuss 
things on.
