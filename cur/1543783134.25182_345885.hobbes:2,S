We have another issue with the APIC IDs: the GET_APIC_ID and 
APIC_ID_MASK macros from the subarch code. In all subarchs except summit 
and es7000, these macros use a hard-coded mask 0x0F for the APIC ID. 
Thus, any APIC ID >15 will be truncated, leading to obscure errors.
We are wondering why these masks are there in the subarch code at all. 
After all, whether or not 8-bit APIC IDs are supported depends mainly on 
the CPU type used. Why wouldn't it possible to have a "default" 
architecture with APIC IDs > 15, if the CPUs allow it?
In other words: What would be broken if we just used an APIC ID mask of 
0xFF everywhere?
The current situation with MP_valid_apicid() on the one hand (masking 
the APIC ID as a function of local APIC version) and APIC_ID_MASK 
(masking the APIC as a function of subarch) on the other hand is 
inconsistent. A correct approach must take both CPU and architecture 
constraints into account, and use a CPU-type-dependent variable mask in 
the subarch code.

Martin
