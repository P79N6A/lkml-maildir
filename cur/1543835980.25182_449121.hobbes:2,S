RAID1 can do that in theory but it practice there is no verification,
so the other disk can perform another read simultaneously (thus
increasing performance).
Some high-end systems, maybe.
That would be hardly economical. Per-block checksums (like used by the
ZFS) are different story, they add only little additional load.

Yep, that could be done. Or with 2 disks with block checksums.
Actually, while I don't exactly buy their ads, I think ZFS employs
some useful ideas.

With per-block checksum you will know. Of course, that's still not
end to end checksum.

Drives have internal relocation mechanisms, I don't think the
filesystem needs to duplicate them (though it should try to work
with bad blocks - relocations are possible on write).

Sure you have to, if you value your data.

I don't think so. Going read-only if the disk returns write error,
ok. But taking the fs offline? Why?
Continuous backups (or rather transaction logs) are possible but
who has them? Do you have them? Would you throw away several hours
of work just because some file (or, say, unused area) contained
unreadable block (which could probably be transient problem, and/or
could be corrected by write)?
