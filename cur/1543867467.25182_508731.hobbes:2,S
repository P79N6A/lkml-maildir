Except that You Can't Do That (tm).  Try to predict beforehand if the code 
path being followed will touch the FPU or SSE state, and you can't.  There is 
no way to avoid the context switch overhead, as you have to preserve things 
so that whatever state is being returned to the user is as it was.  Unless 
you plan on resetting the state beforehand, but then you have to call into 
arch specific code that ends up with a comparable overhead to the context 
switch.
