Herbert,
Thanks much for these i810_audio patches.  I've been meaning to review 
them in-depth for some time.
Could you be kind and "spell out" the patch-1 race for me?
Also, it seems to me that you would want to check for signal_pending()
(a) just after the schedule_timeout(), and
(b) -after- testing the 'signals_allowed' variable  ;-)
Comments?
