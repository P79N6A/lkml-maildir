That is not correct, I posted before on this, the address method is in the
high bits of the 8 byte LUN and tells how to "interpret" the LUN value.
You can't convert from an int to 8 byte LUN (without any other
information) and set these bits. See SAM-4 in (or near) section 4.9.7.
So some storage devices that want to use addressing methods other than 00b
don't because we do not have 8 byte LUN support in linux, and then we have
other problems because of this.
