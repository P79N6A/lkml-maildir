Hi,
If I have to make modifications to TCP congestion handling, like congestion
window size where do I start? For examples if I need to modify the reset value
for CWND (when a tx timeout accurs). It seems like the function tcp_enter_loss
does something but I am not sure. So I was wondering if anyone could give me
all the details.
shreeni.
