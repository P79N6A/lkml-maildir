btw., why isnt there an in-kernel whitelist, with perhaps a dynamic, 
convenient /debug/s2r/whitelist append-API for distros (and testers) to 
add more entries to the whitelist/blacklist? (for cases where the kernel 
whitelist has not caught up yet) Which would eventually converge to 
Utopia: s2ram that just works out of box.
This would be a lot more flexible (people could even temporarily extend 
the whitelist via rc.local if need to be, etc.), a lot more robust and a 
lot more user friendly than the "dont use /sys/power/state, rely on some 
user-space tool to work around bugs" approach.
Really, i couldnt make the s2ram API/quirks situation much worse even if 
i deliberately tried to design the whole code to be as hard to use and 
as confusing as possible :-/ These types of half-kernel half-userspace 
solutions usually result in constant finger-pointing and constant lag, 
and they result in about the crappiest user experience that is possible 
to achieve physically.
( Sorry about the strong words, while there's lots of good and positive
  development lately i havent seen much change in this particular area
  of s2ram in the past 1-2 years, and the whole chain is only as strong
  as the weakest link - so someone finally has to deliver this message
  to the cozy fire of s2r hackers while our testers and users are 
  standing out in the cold rain ... )
