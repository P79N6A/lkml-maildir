Same as now with "cp" - partial copy.

Irrelevant, since you can't access the file at that point (i.e. if server
continues then great, but if it doesn't it's no different than the server
disconnecting/crashing in the middle of a regular copy.

Sync file locally before starting, and no buffers on client are created.
If you write to file while it is being copied, how is that different
than two writers for same file now (i.e. usually broken).  If the network
filesystem doesn't support locking, that's the filesystem's problem and
this API doesn't change it.

Covered pretty well elsewhere.  Of course EINTR should be reserved for
"interrupted, please continue if you want" as opposed to a hard error.

Partial copy, no different than now.

Reads partial file, no different than now.

Support signals and restart the copy where it left off.  Interrupting
once a second or whatever isn't onerous if needed and you can restart.
You could even support some sort of "SIGUSR1" like dd does to get status
back without actually killing things.  Alternately, just stat the target
file as it is being copied to watch progress.
Cheers, Andreas
