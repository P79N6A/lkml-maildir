This is a known issue for PPC with more than 4 processors. Work is in 
progress for a general fix.
You should have not been able to select SLUB at all given that you have 4 
processor configured. Hmmm... The Kconfig comparison for more than 4 cpus 
does only seem to work in certain cases.
Could I have a complete .config?
