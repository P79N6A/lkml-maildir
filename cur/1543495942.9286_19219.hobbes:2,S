Only other executables are a.out (nobody uses them these days) and 
scripts. But take a look: we do not honour setuid bit on scripts,
anyway! It is perl interpretter who has s bit. So I do not think
scripts are issue.

Yes, going namespace would be nicer, but is _extremely hard_ as you
would need to modify tools such as tar, cp, nfsd etc. And I doubt it
will be usefull. As long as elf is only widespread executable format
(and it is - sbit is not honoured for scripts and a.out is dead), I
think this solution is pretty much ok.
