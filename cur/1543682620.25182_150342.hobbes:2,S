"SCO has announced its latest move: concerned Linux users will be able to buy 
a UnixWare License for a "run-time, binary use of Linux." If you buy into 
their protection scheme, they promise not to sue - but only for binary use. 
Looking at the source (or modifying it), it seems, will not be allowed. It 
will be interesting to see how many companies actually buy these licenses."
Sounds like extortion to me..
Jeff.
