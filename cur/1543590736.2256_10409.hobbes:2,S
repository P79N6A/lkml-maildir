It should never be seen by apps. If it can be then it is wrong code.
Basically you use it in things like
	int err = dev->ioctlfunc(dev, op, arg);
	if( err != -ENOIOCTLCMD)
		return err;
	/* Driver specific code does not support this ioctl */
	switch(op)
	{
			...
		default:
			return -ENOTTY;
	}
Its a way of passing back 'you handle it'
