Thanks, I will investigate.

That's the point.

If he is able to do so, yes - there is nothing we can do. But
I suspect a single machine would not have all possible hardware.
The problem is, we don't know what would it have, so it must be
dynamic.

We can't - hardware capabilities limit that. A general purpose
distribution would probably want to compile in everything (perhaps
as modules).

That would be most limiting with IMHO no visible advantage.
