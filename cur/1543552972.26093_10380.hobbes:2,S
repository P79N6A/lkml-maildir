Seen it, re-read my question...
I keep seeing "audio drivers' mmap" used a specific example of a place
that would benefit from kiobufs.  The current via audio mmap looks quite
a bit like mmap_kiobuf and its support code... except without all the
kiobuf overhead.
My question from above is:  how can the via audio mmap in test10-preXX
be improved by using kiobufs?  I am not a kiobuf expert, but AFAICS a
non-kiobuf implementation is better for audio drivers.  (and the via
audio mmap implementation is what some other audio drivers are about to
start using...)
I can clearly see that many applications will find kiobufs quite useful
(learned another from alan just now...), but I do not see that audio
drivers can benefit from kiobufs at all.  Corrections on this fact are
requested, as I am hacking audio drivers right now and want to make sure
I pick the best course of action for the long term.
Regards,
	Jeff
