Actually, it's a lot tighter than that.  You need to *issue* the "park head"
command 300-500ms before it hits the ground, and you have 300ms of free fall.
So you may have needed to detect the free fall and issue the command 200ms
before the free fall commences.
That's a *real* hard RT constraint to keep. ;)
