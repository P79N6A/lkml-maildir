Yeah I don't think it is really worth the complexity and corner cases
it would introduce at this stage.
People are still complaining about their nightly cron job *swapping*
stuff out of their 1-2GB desktop systems. There must still be some low
hanging fruit or obvious problems with page reclaim so I'd like to try
working out exactly what is going wrong and fix it in page reclaim
rather than adding more complexity in the hope that it might help.
