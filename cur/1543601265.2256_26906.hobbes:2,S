Can we confirm that the mp3 player is making subpage accesses? (strace)
The 'partially read/written' state isn't handled properly now.  The 
transition to the 'used-once' state should only occur if the transfer ends at 
the exact end of the page.  Right now it always takes place after the *first* 
transfer on the page which is correct only for full-page transfers.
It's still best to start all pages unreferenced, because otherwise we don't 
have a means of distinguishing between the first and subsequent page cache 
lookups.  The check_used_once logic should set the page referenced if the IO 
transfer ends in the interior of the page or unreferenced if it ends at the 
end of the page.
This straightforward to fix, I'll have a tested patch by Tuesday if nobody 
beats me to it.  I don't think this is the whole problem though, it's just 
exposing a balancing problem.  Even if I did go and randomly access a huge 
file so that all cache pages have high age (the effect we're simulating by 
accident here) I still shouldn't be able to drive all my swap pages out of 
memory.
