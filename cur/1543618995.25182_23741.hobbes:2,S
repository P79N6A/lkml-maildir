 That's something that should really be fixed.
 I believe a while back someone was going to send a ping to all
 the listed addresses in MAINTAINERS. Doing this again may not
 be a bad idea.

 Now that we have an open development branch again, perhaps its
 time for a lot of the things that have been proven stable in vendor
 kernels for a long time to get a looksee in mainline.
 Some things I feel will likely still be vendor-kernel only for some time.
 And some of them, rightly so.
