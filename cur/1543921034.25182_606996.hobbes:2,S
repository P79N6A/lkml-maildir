Tried you patch. Now the card works even without any model selected. Also the 
speakers sound "better" now :D . Bass is nearly too loud.
Tnx for looking into this!
Just on question: is it possible to mute the main speakers when headphones get 
plugged in ? Atm the internal speakers stay on.
Best regards
