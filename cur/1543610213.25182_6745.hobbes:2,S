Hi All,
I need to know where can I download a complete native SDK for iPAQ (not a 
cross-compiler).
I need to get a native development tools because I want recompile
some applications that perform some gcc tests like configure.
This development tools should be mounted from an external share like nfs or 
smbfs
because there isn't enough space on the iPAQ, right ?
And finally, does anyone know if smbfs works well on iPAQ ?
Thanks very much.
Roberto Fichera.
