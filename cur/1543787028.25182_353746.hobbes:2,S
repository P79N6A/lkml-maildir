And it's not gotten anymore includable.  Please fix the major structural
issues pointed out when you first sent it out.  That's in the following
order:
 - not trying to integrate with the sas transport class in Linus'
   tree at all, not even using the transport class infrastructure
   at all, creating it's own sysfs trees in rather wierd ways
 - not beeing structures as a library (ala libata which is a very good
   model for it)
 - duplicating the lun scanning code instead of using the scsi core one
-
