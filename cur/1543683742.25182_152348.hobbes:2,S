Agreed, and no doubt the smaller the timeslice the worse it is. I did a little 
experimenting with my P4 2.53 here and found that basically no matter how 
much longer the timeslice was there was continued benefit. However the 
benefit was diminishing the higher you got. If you graphed it out it was a 
nasty exponential curve up to 7ms and then there was a knee in the curve and 
it was virtually linear from that point on with only tiny improvements. A p3 
933 behaved surprisingly similarly. That's why on 2.4.21-ck3 it was running 
with timeslice_granularity set to 10ms. However the round robin isn't as bad 
as pure timeslice limiting because if they're still on the active array I am 
led to believe there is less cache trashing. 
There was no answer in that but just thought I'd add what I know so far.
