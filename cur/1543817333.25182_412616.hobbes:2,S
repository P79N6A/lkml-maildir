What are the kmaps for, anyway?  afaict they're doing the
kmap-the-page-while-we-run-some-a_ops thing which ceased being a
requirement 3-4 years ago.
The general approach we should take is that the code which actually
modifies a page's contents is the code which is responsible for kmapping
that page.  Use an atomic kmap, memcpy-or-memset, atomic kunmap.  Just four
or five lines.
If we can do that, pipe_buf_operations.map/unmap can be removed.
