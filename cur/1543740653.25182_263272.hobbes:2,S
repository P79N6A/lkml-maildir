sorry, but just look at the kcond code and compare the 'fastpath' with
say the fastpath of Linux semaphores or waitqueue handling.
condition variables (here i dont mean your code specifically, but the
general pthread concept) are simply trying to achieve too much via a
single object, which increases their complexity quite significantly.
Separating out a few select atomic synchronization primitives that can
be used for each appropriate purpose does the job equally well.
condition variables are fine if you 1) already know them from userspace
and 2) want to use a single locking abstraction for everything. It is
thus also a kitchen-sink primitive that is inevitably slow and complex.
I still have to see a locking problem where condvars are the
cleanest/simplest answer, and i've yet to see a locking problem where
condvars are not the slowest answer ;)
of course this too is valid kernel code so i'm not complaining at all.
It was simply too complex to be converted at first sight to
PREEMPT_REALTIME.
