Yes, I realise all of this.  But everyone seems to get this damned 
territorial attitude that I want to see kernel development stopped, quite 
the opposite.  All I want to see is a stable target for certain windows of 
time.  So that way when bugs are fixed that are trivial there's a place to 
go without upgrading scads of userland stuff or worrying about lots of 
unrelated change.
