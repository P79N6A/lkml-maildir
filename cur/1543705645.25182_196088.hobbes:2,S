Um, wrong answer.  When you ask for more than one page from the buddy
allocator  (order greater than 0) it always returns physically contiguous
pages.
Also, one of the near-term goals in VM is to be able to allocate and free
large pages from the main memory pools, which requires that something like
order 9 or 10 allocations (based on the architecture) succeed.
