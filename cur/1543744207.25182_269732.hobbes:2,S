Hi,
I assume You are trying to use rivafb with nvidia binary drivers? If 
that's the case, then here's an excerpt from NVIDIA README file:
Q: My system hangs when vt-switching if I have rivafb enabled.
A: Using both rivafb and the NVIDIA kernel module at the same time is
    currently broken.  In general, using two independent software drivers
    to drive the same piece of hardware is a bad idea.
So it is unlikely to make this two drivers to work together.
