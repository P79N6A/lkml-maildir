Hi all,
I'm not subscribed to the list so please CC me on replies/thread this 
might produce, thanks.
I recently bought a new PC with ATI IXP chipset for sound, video, ide.
sound is working correctly but IDE was really slow (no dma) until I
recompiled my Fedora core 3 kernel, changing include/linux/pci_ids.h
to have my chipset recognized as a ati_ixp one.
here is the result of lspci on the computer:
00:00.0 Host bridge: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 7833
00:01.0 PCI bridge: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 7838
00:13.0 USB Controller: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 4367 (rev 01)
00:13.1 USB Controller: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 4368 (rev 01)
00:13.2 USB Controller: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 4365 (rev 01)
00:14.0 SMBus: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 4363 (rev 03)
00:14.1 IDE interface: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 4369 (rev 01)
00:14.3 ISA bridge: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 436c (rev 01)
00:14.4 PCI bridge: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown device 4362 (rev 01)
00:14.5 Multimedia audio controller: ATI Technologies Inc: Unknown 
device 4361 (rev 03)
01:05.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc Radeon 9100 PRO IGP
02:06.0 Communication controller: Conexant HSF 56k HSFi Modem (rev 01)
02:0b.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. 
RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)
To have the chipset recognized, I just changed the line:
/* ATI IXP Chipset */
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_ATI_IXP_IDE        0x4349
with this one:
#define PCI_DEVICE_ID_ATI_IXP_IDE       0x4369
after that, dmesg says kernel recognized the chip and DMA is working,
hdparm -t changed from 8MB/s to 47MB/s, nice !
messaged during boot (dmesg):
Uniform Multi-Platform E-IDE driver Revision: 7.00alpha2

hdd: DVD-ROM BDV316E, ATAPI CD/DVD-ROM drive

I guess this could be taken care of in a future release of the kernel,
or maybe you need more documentation from Ati on what have changed
between these 2 releases of the chip ?
I am volunteering to test the patches that might be produced to make
this hardware function correctly, if needed ...
