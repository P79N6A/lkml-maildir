That being said, I did have some problems with dropped packets that went
completely away upon upgrading to the newest Linux kernel, 2.2.12.  These
problems existed in 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 as far as I knew.  I'm not sure what was
fixed, but something was.
I was having problems with Windows clients that sometimes could not contact
the server, especially when the server was under high load.  We got new hubs
and switches, redid some of the wiring, etc., but what fixed it for good was
the kernel upgrade.
If the problem continues with 2.2.12 for you, then you might have another
problem, however.
