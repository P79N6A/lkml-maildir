"too short" means that the update happens often enough to cause a
noticeable performance degradation.
In an application writes steadily very 21msecs (or maybe 30msecs) then
there will be 2 superblock writes and 1 application write every
21msecs, and this causes enough disk io to close the app down. - I
guess all the updates fill up the 21msec space.
With a larger delay - 200msec - you could still get bad situations
e.g. with the app writing every 210msecs.  However 2 superblock
updates plus one app write is a much smaller fraction of 200msecs, so
there shouldn't be as many problems.
Yes, a more detailed explanation should go in Documentation/md.txt
