One last followup:
This problem has gone way in 2.6.6(fedora
2.6.6-1.424).
Whatever change was made between 2.6.5 and 2.6.6
fixed this. In 2.6.6, I can in fact create 10,000
threads and this does not hang the entire machine 
(in 2.6.5, when the machine hung, even the console 
was inoperative and I couldn't run vmstat or cat
/proc/meminfo to see what was going on). 
Best regards,
