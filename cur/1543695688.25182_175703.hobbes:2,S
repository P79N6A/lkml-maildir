Ah, cool.  Thanks.  (It's now in my init script.)
Do you know if this affects x's screensaver timeout?  (Probably not, but I'm 
not sure how to look it up.  Maybe X gets the value from console 7, somehow?  
Then again, if this was a per-console thing setting it in the initscripts 
when the console is /dev/console rather than virtual wouldn't necessarily 
work...  Huh.)
