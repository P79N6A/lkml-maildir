The problem is that we are wasting time calling do_timer in a loop. This
is especially true on system that switch off the timer interrupt while
the cpu is idle. You can easily have thousands of lost ticks.

This is what I hoped would happen. The loops gets pushed through the
layers to the place where it is actually needed. The next step could be
to get rid of the loop altogether by changing CALC_LOAD.
