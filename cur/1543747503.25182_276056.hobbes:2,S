Look at what I quoted above. It is the same box, just running cdrecord
as root or as user. The 'Supported modes:' line is empty.
What has the firmware to do with that ?
A guess: perhaps the problem is:
WARNING ! Cannot gain SYS_RAWIO capability ! 
: Operation not permitted
as user, so system does not allow the user to query the drive at low
level via some ioctl() or the liketo get the supported modes.
BTW, using the LSM realtime module for group cdwriter (80 in my box)
killed this messages:
cdrecord: Cannot allocate memory. WARNING: Cannot do mlockall(2).
cdrecord: WARNING: This causes a high risk for buffer underruns.
cdrecord: Operation not permitted. WARNING: Cannot set RR-scheduler
cdrecord: Permission denied. WARNING: Cannot set priority using setpriority().
cdrecord: WARNING: This causes a high risk for buffer underruns.
so at least this is good (TM).
