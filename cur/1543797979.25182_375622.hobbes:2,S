I guess this may be the only patch needed so far.  x86_64 doesn't use a
RWSEM_XCHGADD_ALGORITHM, and as for the other archs:
alpha and ia64 - doesn't have PREEPMT_RT yet.
arm, cris, frv, h8300, m32r, parsic don't seem to implement the XCHGADD.
But I see that powerpc will need a fix, but I'll let others who actually
have the boards to fix them. ;-)
As for what I own: x86_64 and i386, the patches I sent are sufficient.
If anyone would like to give me a special board (to keep), I'll gladly
make sure that Ingo's -RT kernel runs on it.
