Yes, that was exactly what I was demonstrating ... those are
the callbacks that'd be supplied to mempool_create(), showing
that it doesn't need to change for that kind of usage.  (Which
isn't allocating DMA buffers, note!)
But we still need lower level allocators that are reasonable
for use with 1/Nth page allocations ... which isn't a problem
that mempool even attempts to solve.  Hence dma_pool, in any of
its implementations, would go underneath mempool to achieve what
Adam was describing (for drivers that need it).
