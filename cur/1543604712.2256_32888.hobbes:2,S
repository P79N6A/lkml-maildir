Hi!
I was curious about "CPU affinity" in linux. I found some patches which add 
affinity in task_struct but later I found out that "cpus_allowed" in 
task_struct almost does the same thing.
It resulted in some new curiosity: where's cpus_allowed initialized? I can 
only find an assignment to cpus_allowed for softirq's but no initialization 
for other processes. I assume the correct init value would be "0xffffffff" or 
-1. Can't find it though.
I'm sure I'm overlooking something, but that doesn't help me finding the 
answer. So would someone be so kind to enlighten me?
Thanks,
Rolf
