Hi!
For testing (read() and write() is returning wrong value on 2.4
kernels) I played a bit with really big numbers... And I found out we
have year 9223372034708485227 problem ;-).

I'm not sure if it is kernel problem... but it is sure pretty
common. I wonder how much damage it will do to my filesystems: touch
foo seems to store the right year into reiserfs. I wonder if it is
still there after reboot? No, it is not. That looks like kernel bug :-).
Anyway I believe we are going to have some fun in year 2038. Even if
all systems are 64-bit by then, there will still be some 32-bit fields
hidden somewhere.
