Agreed, partially. There is the current issue of the kernel stack
being just 8k in size and no decent mechanism in place to detect a
stack overflow. And there is (arguably) the future issue of the kernel
stack shrinking to 4k.
Stuff like intermezzo will break with 4k, no discussion about that.
Other stuff may or may not work. What I'm trying to do is pave the way
to shrink the kernel stack during 2.7 sometime.
If there is large agreement that the kernel stack should not shrink,
I'll stop this effort any day. But so far, I am under the impression
that the agreement is to do the shink. Am I wrong?
