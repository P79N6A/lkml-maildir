Hi
I confused the bootsect.S which's in the betwenn 2.4.* kernel and 2.6.*.
I mean in 2.4.* , it like "jmp $INITSEG, $go",
but In 2.6.* like 2.6.11,I can not find where use "INITSEG" in
the bootsect.S file.
And i'm greate intersted in the basic things in linux. the boot
must the first thing.
So i want i can get a good document which descripe the bootsect.S
file.and some tips will fine too.
another is where's the latest document for 2.6.* kernel? the faq's only 2.4.*
If you know about it,please tell me.
My kernel is 2.6.11.
Thanks
