There was previously a patch by Goldwyn Rodrigues in linux-kernel:
"[PATCH] Pushing ext3 file size limits beyond 2TB", which at least
got as far as 4TB for the file size (for 4kB blocks).
Beyond that, we need a format change and may as well have something
like extents, but even extents still need to allow a larger i_blocks,
so that patch would be useful in any case...  though it needs some
cleanup to remove all users of i_frag and i_faddr (which have never
ever been used).
Laurent, do your 64-bit patches include support for larger i_blocks?
Cheers, Andreas
