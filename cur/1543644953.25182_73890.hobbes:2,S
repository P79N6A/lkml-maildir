This breaks ntfs/malloc.h which is doing the following:
49:       return __vmalloc(size, GFP_NOFS | __GFP_HIGHMEM, PAGE_KERNEL);
This turns into 
	
          return __vmalloc(size, ((struct gfp_arg *)(0x10 | 0x40 |
		0x80)) | 0x02, ((pgprot_t) { (__PAGE_KERNEL) } ));
		
which '|' is not happy with.
