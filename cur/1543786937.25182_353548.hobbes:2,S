If you have one, two, or more different versions of a userland program
(which gcc is) installed, is nothing the kernel cares about. This is a
userspace problem, not a kernel problem.
There is plenty of documentation to be found via google and other
sources that describe how to accomplish what you want to do - spend a
little time searching.
Here's one document that describes an installation of multiple gcc
versions (and there are lots of others out there) :
