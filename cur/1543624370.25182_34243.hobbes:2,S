Basically I would like to try to follow the FreeBSD nomenclature as much as
possible, becouse:
1. I started doing Linux, becouse I like UNIX ;-).
2. It helps (in some distant time) to look at both side by side.
3. It helps to see what has changed "recently".
4. "Learning from the Soviet Union is learning about victory"... just kidding
I'm. But you are from .cz so you already know ;-).
