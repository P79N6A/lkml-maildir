So what you actually need is a mediator module controlling concurrent
access to the speaker hardware from both pcspkr and snd_pcsp and
making sure that one does not disrupt the other. This is completely
outside of the scope of the input subsystem tough.

You are right, I misunderstood the purpose of snd_pcsp. Still the best
solution would be to allow beeps to come through if user keeps them
enabled.
