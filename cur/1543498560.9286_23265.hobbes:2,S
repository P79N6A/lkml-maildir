Older Amiga computers had this feature too, but then they changed it so
that one could only switch it between two levels of intensity.
A good reason for this is , that if the Power LED is off , someone
might think that the machine is not powered on and try to "turn it on".
It happened a few times with a PC server here , which had the LEDs disconnected.
After being turned off by accindent a few times , the admin took the time to 
open the case and connect the wires :-)
