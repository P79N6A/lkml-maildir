The linux-2.5 tree right now (I'm re-doing the conversion, and am up to
October of last year, so far) is at 141M, if you don't count the pristine
cache or working directory.  That's already compressed, so you don't get
any extra bonuses.  Darcs stores with each changeset both the old and new
versions of each hunk, which gives you some redundancy, and probably
accounts for the factor of two greater size than CVS.  This gives a bit of
redundancy, which can be helpful in cases of repository corruption.

Darcs' RAM use has indeed already improved somewhat... I'm not exactly sure
how much.  I'm not quite sure how to measure peak virtual memory usage, and
most of the time darcs' memory use while doing the linux kernel conversion
is under a couple of hundred megabytes.
There are indeed trickinesses involved in making sure garbage gets
collected in a timely manner when coding in a lazy language like haskell.

Correction:  we already have a checkpoint system.  The work in progress is
making commands that examine the history fail gracefully when that history
isn't present.

I presume you're referring to a local checkout? That is already done using
hard links by darcs--only of course the working directory has to actually
be copied over, since there are editors out there that aren't friendly to
hard-linked files.

And here's where darcs really falls down.  To track the history of a single
file it has to read the contents of every changeset since the creation of
that file, which will take forever (well, not quite... but close).
I hope to someday (when more pressing issues are dealt with) add a per-file
cache indicating which patches affect which files, which should largely
address this problem, although it won't help at all with files that are
touched by most of the changesets, and won't be optimimal in any case. :(
