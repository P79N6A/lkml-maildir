I had similiar problems moving from 2.6.18 to 2.6.19-rc1. It might
have something to do with me using a new kernel on an old
distributation, but things like INIT need sysctl.
I had a time getting CONFIG_SYSCTL_SYSCALL=y to stick so I changed the
kernel/sysctl.c ifdefs. You might try and it looks like you are using
x86_64 so double check for usage of that define under arch/x86_64. I
thought I saw it under the 32bit emulation stuff.
Boot just fine after this.
