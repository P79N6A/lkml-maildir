Thanks to all of you for the several suggestions, but none was
successfull till now:
I tried as boot cmd line:
	s root=03:41 acpi=off
and still it didn't work. Same problem.
And I am not using devfs.
My lilo looks like this:
boot = /dev/hda2
install = /boot/boot-bmp.b
bitmap = /boot/debian-bootscreen-woody.bmp
bmp-colors=1,,0,2,,0
bmp-table=120p,173p,1,15,17
bmp-timer=254p,432p,1,0,0
read-only
prompt
timeout=100
password=""
  mandatory
vga=0x317
...
image=/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.0-test3
        label=2.6.0-test3
        append="amd_disconnect=yes"
        read-only
        restricted
Where amd_disconnect a patch is which sets a bit in the pci register to
allow the athlon to disconnect during idle, which greatly decreases my
cpu/mobo temperature. But this is not done till the place were the root
fs should have been loaded.
Best wishes
Norbert
