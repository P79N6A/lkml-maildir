Wow.  That might be one for the quotes file:
    "GNU ... was of the early GNU/Linux system.  GNU ... included non-GNU"
Well, that certainly explains a lot.  If you define GNU as "anything
which might be found on a Linux distro including non-GNU packages",
your position starts to make a certain twisted sense.  Only one problem
with that: if it wasn't GNU, it wasn't GNU, which means, Richard, you
are crackin' smoke and may need a vacation.  19 years of hard effort is 
a long time, have you considered retirement?  You've certainly earned it.
Oh, by the way, have you updated the GNU kernel pages to reflect the new
proper name: Linux/Hurd?  I'd really appreciate it if you could get to that.
