Wrong.  And I've already explained this.  There are functions in place
for just these kind of situations since they come up whether you want
it or not.

If you would use a recent library you'd see that unless the user does
something stupid there is always a sigreturn handler installed.  No
signal handler on the stack.

It's already implemented.  Similar to Sun's scheme.  And it's possible
to completely disable it if you don't need it.
