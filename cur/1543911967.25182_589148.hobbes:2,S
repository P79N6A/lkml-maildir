Although I agree with the patch, there are people on this list that will
reject it due to the fact distro's ship today having udev label and
device id mapping, so device ordering should be an non-issue.  However
there are systems that ship that don't have BIOS BBS support, allowing
you to select the boot device. Without it BBS support, you are forced to
boot to the lowest device id.  There are HP and Dell systems like that.
Are SUN systems like that?   If so, there is an additional patch which I
have yet posted that will sort the raid volumes in acsending order.
Currently they are in descending order (due to Firmware putting them in
that order), which if you did a install to what you think is /dev/sda,
its really the highest target id, and when you reboot, the BIOS will
boot to the lowest id, which is /dev/sdb, and it will not find the boot
partition.
