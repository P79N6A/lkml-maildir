That correct, yes. SSP is actually used by quite a lot of vendors, and
shouldn't be used outside of userland. Typically speaking it isn't, but
in this case its being leaked.
I've also heard some strange reports with ppc32 and 2.6.16 not
decompressing properly all of the time which might be related. I've not
been able to recreate this, nor heard any feedback yet.
