Maybe I've been a bit hasty with the celebration.
It looks like I've got a bigger locking problem here.
If autofs4_dentry_release waits on the rehash lock and
autofs4_lookup_unhashed reclaims it then the info struct and the dentry
go away unconditionally as the release is called just prior to freeing
the dentry memory, right?.
But you've certainly identified the problem with it.
Let me think about it a little while.
