Thanks Nigel. :-)

The page cache that is not mapped by anyone is copied before creating the
image and the copy is included in the image.  However there would be a problem
if some page cache mapped by someone else were mapped by the suspending
task after it had exited the kernel.
Fortunately this task is forbidden to open() or mmap() any files at that time
anyway, because it would be likely to corrupt some filesystems if it did.
In fact it must not _touch_ any filesystems after the image has been created.
Greetings,
Rafael
