Of course. If you look at the diffstat, as kindly posted by Randy,
you'll notice that about 500-600 of those lines are documentation,
configuration files, and headers.
What's really a concern (and a valid argument) is the overhead
introduced for each call to printk(); the defconfig kernel on x86
increases with about 210K. I will try to improve this.

With the current code, localisation is not possible to do in a sane
way. My change is a "catch all" in desired features -- not just
removing some unwanted printks.
