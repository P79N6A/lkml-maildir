I fail to see why using sockets et al in shell scripts is that important.
You have full access to the API from Perl, for one; shell scripts are used
mostly as scaffolding for calling "normal" programs, so inventing something
to do what you want and call that from the shell is the way to go IMHO.
Only if there is absolutely no way to do it sanely outside the kernel, and
futhermore it is very important to do, should the kernel get involved
(sure, Linux is way the largest Unix installed base around today, but still
_far_ from the one that defines the standards in the area, which means a
Linux-only system call is a step forward and three back, so...)
