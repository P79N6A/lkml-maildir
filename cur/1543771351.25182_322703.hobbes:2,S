~/.procmailrc

Replace some expression with a grep expression that matches all email
addresses that you consider personal.  Such mail on any list gets the
line 'X-Personal: YES' added, which makes it trivial to file or index
them separately.
To suppress duplicate messages, also in .procmailrc
:0 Wh: msgid.lock
| formail -D 20000 msgid.cache
