1. If you have two subsystems which allocate critical pages, how do you 
protect against the condition where one subsystem allocates all the 
critical memory, causing the second to oom?
2. There already exists a critical pool: ordinary allocations fail if 
free memory is below some limit, but special processes (kswapd) can 
allocate that memory by setting PF_MEMALLOC. Perhaps this should be 
extended, possibly with a per-process threshold.
