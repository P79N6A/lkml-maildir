Hmm.  I guess I just missed it.

There is something this brings up.  Currently OpenVZ seems to be a
project where you guys do the work and release the source under the
GPL.  Making it technically an open source project.  However at the
development level it does not appear to be a community project, at
least at the developer level.
There is nothing wrong with not doing involving the larger community
in the development, but what it does mean is that largely as a
developer OpenVZ is uninteresting to me.

Looks a little better yes.  This actually surprises me because my
past experience is that usually well focused patches are easier
to forward port as they usually have fewer collisions and those
collisions are usually easier to resolve.
