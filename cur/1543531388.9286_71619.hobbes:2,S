In this case, just delete the `: "cx"' line.  There's no reason to have it
as "roll" doesn't modify cx, except of course if you're doing
`rol %cl,%ecx', which is unlikely but quite legal.  BTW, the
"r" constraint can be relaxed to "g" here to give gcc a little more
latitude with register allocation.
