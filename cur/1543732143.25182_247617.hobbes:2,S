You didn't say what architecture, and the answer may vary by arch.,
especially in 2.4.x.
In 2.4.27, you have to enable 'Kernel debugging' in the
'Kernel hacking' menu in order to be able to set MAGIC_SYSRQ.
(for i386 arch.)
In 2.6.9-rc1, you have to enable 'Kernel debugging' in the
'Kernel hacking' menu in order to be able set MAGIC_SYSRQ.
What arch. specifically?

Nope, not going anywhere.
