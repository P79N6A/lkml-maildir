Don't do it this way.  Use /proc/<pid>/attr/ interface if you only want
to handle creating restrictions within a process.  If you're using it to
load your policy, then create a reasonable filesystem interface and do
it that way.  This will be portable across versions and architectures
without allocating any syscalls.
thanks,
