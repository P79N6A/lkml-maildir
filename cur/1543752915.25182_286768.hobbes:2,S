Does *anything* have it, including files?
I think read() always has the option of returning a short read on
signal delivery.
What urandom has is a no-block guarantee, i.e. the behaviour should be
identical in the presense of the O_NONBLOCK flag, and select/poll
should always indicate that data can be read.
