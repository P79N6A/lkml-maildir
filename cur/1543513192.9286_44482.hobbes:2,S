Subject: Trying Again: RAID + Network == OOPS

Let's try this again; I've posted the problem a couple times now with no
real feedback. As far as I can tell, it's a legitimate problem, so I'll
keep trying...
My file server works fine as long as there is no RAID and Network
activity happening simultaneously; NFS or other network activity to the
RAID device seems to cause crashes. Primarily the NFS processes cause
OOPSes, although I've also seen an 'ftpd' OOPS and screw up the
machine.  The RAID device is RAID0.  
I say it seems to work OK without network access because running fsck
against the RAID device takes a good hour of grinding all three drives
simultaneously and I have yet to see it crash doing that.  I'm also able
to back up the RAID volume to tape consistently without problems. 
Network traffic to non-RAID partitions don't seem to cause problems, but
it might just be that I haven't seen any problems yet.  A large amount
of traffic over the network to the RAID device, either from one machine
seriously pounding it, or several machines accessing it simultaneously,
will eventually cause an OOPS.  It doesn't seem to matter if it's read
or write activity to cause problems.  (Strangely, however, running large
mirror or rsync jobs from the local console that go out over the network
and suck data down onto the RAID partition don't seem to give it
problems.  Only when other machines come into the box to access it
remotely does it consistently OOPS.)
It's a machine based on RedHat 6.0 with all appropriate patches, but
I've replaced the kernel many times, including updating to the latest
knfsd patches and even dumping knfsd entirely and replacing with the
"old-fashioned" nfs-server 2.2beta46.  It's a P200MMX with 64MB of RAM
and a Promise Ultra33 PDC20246 PCI IDE controller that has three Maxtor
IDE drives (three 91303D6) being used as a 36GB RAID array.  It also has
an Intel PCI EEPro 10/100 running at 100Mbps, an old ISA ET4000 VGA
card, and a PCI Adaptec AIC-7850 SCSI card controlling a 4GB DAT.  I've
already replaced motherboard, CPU and RAM and the crashes continue to
happen.  
At the same time I added the Promise controller and three drives to
create the RAID device, I re-installed the machine with RedHat 6.0. 
Previous to that it had been running an older RedHat (5.0? 5.1?) that
was 2.0 kernel and glibc 2.0 based and very stable.  This makes me
suspect that the problems are caused by some interaction between the
network and either the Promise driver or the RAID driver, since, as I've
said, without network activity, the machine is solid, and without
accessing the RAID device over the network, the machine is solid.
According to /proc/interrupts, there are no IRQ conflicts with any of
the devices on the machine.
I think I've tried just about every version of the kernel from 2.2.5 on,
including most of Alan's 'ac' patches, and nothing helps.  These latest
OOPSes happened without knfsd patches applied, but with latest RAID
patches on an otherwise "stock" 2.2.13pre17 kernel.  If anything, it
seems more recent kernel versions might have more frequent problems, but
that might just be because I've been trying harder lately to try to
pinpoint the problem and therefore causing more problems.
Here is what "ksymoops" translated from the last two OOPS messages, the
second of which immediately followed the first:
