Latest beta BIOS which was supposed to fix Linux "DMA timeout" bug. 
I don't remember exact version, It wasn't fixing this bug.

I'm using conservative. It is allowing me to turn off fan with 
bigger cooler borowed from AMD CPU.

Thanks, but it isn't working. It isn't good job. It isn't nothing more
