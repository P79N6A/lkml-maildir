Subject: alsa sound module on 2.5.72 --- does not create /dev/snd/controlC0

Hello out there
I have just switched from 2.5.70 to 2.5.72 on my test box, and found
that I have problems using the mixer for emu10k1, with both alsamixer
and amixer. Using 2.5.71 hit the same problem.
Next, I have used the 2.5.70 source tree for the 2.5.72 build, but the
problem persists.
I have then straced the command "amixer set Master 50 unmute" on both
2.5.70 and 2.5.72, which revealed that on .72 /dev/snd/controlC0 is not
created (the mixer program cannot open it), because /dev/snd is a
symbolic link to /proc/asound/dev which does not exist.
What am I missing?
I am not on the mailing list, so if possible CC to celestar@t-online.de
Thanks in advance.
Victor
