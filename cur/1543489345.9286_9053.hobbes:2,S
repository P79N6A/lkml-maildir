Hello, 
I am a student of Computer Science at Warsaw University. My master
thesis are related to distributed file systems and caching policies. I
wanted to implement NFS client caching for Linux as part of my master
thesis. But I do not want to work on something that is already
implemented. I would by faithfull if you could write what is done (or will
be done) in Linux, specially if Linux has NFS client caching (is it memory
caching or disk caching?). 
I am looking forward to hearing from you soon,
