    Nowdays I must move,delete,add etc some of my partitions.
    Using fdisk with Linux gives for 'w' command :
    Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
    Syncing disks.
    Re-read table failed with error 16: Device or resource busy.
    Reboot your system to ensure the partition table is updated.
    And because of the 'device or resource busy' Linux don't see any of
    my new and modified partitions because it could not reread the partition
    table. (I can mount my partition which was deleted with fdisk etc)
    This is ugly because I must reboot my Linux server four times to
    do my job ;-( Why can't Linux reread partition table if modified partitions
    was not mounted ?
    As far as I remember I hadn't problem with older 2.2.x kernels, but
    with 2.2.5 I must reboot every time :(
Hmm. Under 2.2.5 the reread still succeeds if the disk is unused
and fails if it was in use. I am not aware of any change.
I am not sure why you would want to reboot four times instead of just once.
Sounds like a waste of time.
