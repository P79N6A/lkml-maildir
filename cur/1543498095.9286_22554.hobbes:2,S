Someone needs to write a new benchmark. It's not exactly trivial to
rig up a load of many more slow connections, but that's a lot more
realistic to today's Internet than the mythical "one server with 400
megabits of connection to the Internet serving fast clients".
Have you ever priced 400 megabits of connection to the Internet? It
costs a lot more than that hardware.
