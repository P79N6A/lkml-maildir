Not a bad idea, but it conflicts with one of the goals of 
`make autoconfigurator', which is completely hands-off opration.
Giacomo Catenazzi thinks he has collected enough "safe" probes to 
find effectively all ISA devices, by grovelling through various bits
of /proc.  So this problem may get solved directly.

Probably fewer than 2% of handguns and well under 1% of all guns will
ever be involved in a violent crime. Thus, the problem of criminal gun
violence is concentrated within a very small subset of gun owners,
indicating that gun control aimed at the general population faces a
serious needle-in-the-haystack problem.
