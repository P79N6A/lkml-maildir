I have no clue what I'm doing wrong, perhaps a transcription error, but
I doubt it.  I checked what I wrote down several times before feeding
the output through ksymoops.  I think I better leave it be for a couple
of days and try again.  This is getting very frustrating, especially
since I seem to be the only one experiencing this problem.  I am in
/usr/src/linux-2.3.15 when I do the gdb vmlinux.  It just isn't making
sense.
