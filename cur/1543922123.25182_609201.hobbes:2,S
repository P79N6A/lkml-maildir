more to the point, what the above shows is that the headers aren't
well defined.  one would think that a header file whose name is
"scatterlist.h" should provide content related solely to that name.
if there's different content, such as the "sg helpers" mentioned
above, then those should require a different header file inclusion.
it makes no sense to suggest that one should include
<asm/scatterlist.h> if you need *only* that content, but to include
<linux/scatterlist.h> if you need stuff *in addition to* the
scatterlist content.  that's just begging for confusion.
