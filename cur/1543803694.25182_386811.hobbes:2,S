That's not the point. The point is you can't go around changing things
exported to usersace - that has the potential to break apps.  Even if
no app is known to the people on this list there may still be apps out
there depending on it - and we don't break userspace without *very*
good reasons, and even then it's announced for several months (years
sometimes) in Documentation/feature-removal.txt and elsewhere.
