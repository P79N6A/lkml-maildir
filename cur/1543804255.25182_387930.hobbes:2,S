This can also be a side-effect of /dev/null being damaged.
In scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/check-lxdialog.sh we do:
echo main() {} | gcc -nncursesw -cx - -o /dev/null
I could imagine that your /dev/null has become a regular file and is now
filled with garbage.
And then the trick:
cat /dev/null $(wildcard .kernelrelease)
causes KERNELRELEASE to be full of crap.
Care to check that?
I have not a patch ready to fix the /dev/null issue - later today.
