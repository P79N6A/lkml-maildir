Fully virtualized container is not a matter of virtualized ID - it is 
the easiest thing to do actually, but a whole global problem of other 
resources virtualization. We can ommit ID for now, if you like it more.

No one told that it is not considered. In fact PID virtualization send 
both by IBM/us is abstract and doesn't care whether containers are 
nested or not.
