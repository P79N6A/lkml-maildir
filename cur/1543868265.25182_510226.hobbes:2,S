This is hard to trigger problem, so I'll spare you the rather lengthy log.
It happens if card timeouts and mmc_remove_host is called while mmc_register_card is still in
progress (the hint was in crash dump). If I sleep before remove, it gives the mmc_register_card
chance to finish/mark card as dead and everything's fine.
The remove callback of mmc_block is apparently not executed in this case (probably because device
has not finished registering).
My proposition: lets flush the workqueue first thing in the mmc_remove_host (and make sure that
nothing gets scheduled into it after this).
