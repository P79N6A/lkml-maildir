Hello Zeno,
> NB: I get the same error with the Debian Kernel-Source-2.4.20...
Are you using devfs? If so and you don't have the devfsd running, then 
there won't be any /dev/ttyX devices and the init process will try to 
spawn new consoles unless it gives up with the error message you described.
Make sure to disable devfs support in the kernel in that case. Then 
you'll have the proper /dev/ttyX entries and init can spawn the 
processes without problems.
CU
Michael.
