That beats our cluster record.  The longest uptime we had with 2.0.* was
between the power conditioner shorting out when a fan was being replaced,
and a whole-room shutdown that was traced to a air conditioner on fire --
only nine months.  The 2.0.3* series was very, very reliable.

Hmmm, we had very similar boxes, Dual P6-200 PR440FX motherboards, and got
better performance.  It was about 270Mbps w/ TCP/IP on three bonded Fast
Ethernet channels.  This beat a single Yellowfin card, but IIRC the Hamachi
got over 300Mbps (user-level 'ttcp' with larger transfer sizes).
Alas, I no longer have that hardware to test with.  And it was a local peak
in performance.
