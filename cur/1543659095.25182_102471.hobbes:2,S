No, because somebody might want ext3 only, and have no intention or
desire to mount a filesystem in ext2 mode.  Everything on this laptop
is ext3...

Because if we did that, we'd be setting ourselves up for a mess when
fs/xfs/xfs_qm.c eventually shows up - like it already has ;)
Also, from my (possibly incorrect) reading of kernel/sys.c and
fs/quota.c, there won't be a sys_quotactl() in the kernel.  As a
result, if you have users who have 'quota -v' in their .login, things
might get interesting.  So you might want a config where the quota
system call is there, even if it doesn't do anything incredibly
useful...
