Please don't spread blatently mis-leading information.
My position on this is that if a drive is _persistantly_ unable to
_write_ to any LBA address, it should be binned.  Read errors are a
separate concern.  If they occur, the drive should simply return an
error.  The OS needs to do _NOTHING_.  No special re-writing to force
a re-allocation should be done - we assume the drive is going to do
that, and if it doesn't:
1. DRIVE -> BIN
2. Restore backup.

You may consider that a responsible attitude towards people who are
paying for consultancy, and value their data at more than the physical
cost of the disk, but I do not.

1. Monitor drive.
2. Out of spec temperature?  If yes, remount R/O and page an operator.
3. Go to 1

Such drives are no better in this regard than ST-506 drives in my
opinion.  I have almost always started discussions with a phrase such
as, "assuming we are talking about modern drives that do their own
defect management".
