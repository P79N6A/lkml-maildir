Sounds familiar. I did look at it fleetingly and decided (perhaps wrongly) that
modutils 2.1.x's kerneld is broken when run on 2.0.x kernels. As I found
2.2.0-pre to be stable it didn't bother me, but I might have a look at it now
as I've got nothing else I ought to be doing (or rather, I've plenty I ought
to be doing but nothing I'd rather be doing!)..
Cheers,
Steve
