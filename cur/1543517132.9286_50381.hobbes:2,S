Andre/Frank,
kernel-2.2.13 + ide.2.2.13.19991111.patch + raid0145-19990824-2.2.11
I'm convinced I must be misusing your patch . . . either that or it needs to be
tweaked. The Promise BIOS reports DMA mode 4 for all 4 disks, and yet they are
coming up with wacky/different BIOS settings . . . some PIO and some DMA, in
one case three PIO and one DMA, and in another case three DMA and one PIO.
When compiling the kernel, I chose yes to:
     Intel PIIXn chipsets support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX) [Y/n/?] 
       PIIXn Tuning support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PIIX_TUNING) [Y/n/?] 
     PROMISE PDC20246/PDC20262 support (CONFIG_BLK_DEV_PDC202XX) [Y/n/?] 
       Special UDMA Feature (PDC202XX_FORCE_BURST_BIT) [Y/n/?] 
and no to:
       Special Mode Feature (EXPERIMENTAL) (PDC202XX_FORCE_MASTER_MODE) [N/y/?] 
Besides the main IDE devives, I have 4 identical Maxtors on two PCI cards with
identical 80-pin cables, all with similar run-lengths. At boot time, I see:
PIIX4: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 39
PIIX4: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
    ide0: BM-DMA at 0xf000-0xf007, BIOS settings: hda:pio, hdb:pio
    ide1: BM-DMA at 0xf008-0xf00f, BIOS settings: hdc:pio, hdd:pio
PDC20262: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 40
PDC20262: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20262: ROM enabled at 0xe7000000
PDC20262: (U)DMA Burst Bit ENABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode.
    ide2: BM-DMA at 0xc400-0xc407, BIOS settings: hde:DMA, hdf:pio
    ide3: BM-DMA at 0xc408-0xc40f, BIOS settings: hdg:DMA, hdh:DMA
PDC20262: IDE controller on PCI bus 00 dev 48
PDC20262: not 100% native mode: will probe irqs later
PDC20262: ROM enabled at 0xe8000000
PDC20262: (U)DMA Burst Bit ENABLED Primary PCI Mode Secondary PCI Mode.
    ide4: BM-DMA at 0xd800-0xd807, BIOS settings: hdi:pio, hdj:pio
    ide5: BM-DMA at 0xd808-0xd80f, BIOS settings: hdk:DMA, hdl:pio
which results in 
hda: Maxtor 90845D4, ATA DISK drive
hdc: Maxtor 93652U8, ATA DISK drive
hde: Maxtor 92720U8, ATA DISK drive
hdg: Maxtor 92720U8, ATA DISK drive
hdi: Maxtor 92720U8, ATA DISK drive
hdk: Maxtor 92720U8, ATA DISK drive
ide0 at 0x1f0-0x1f7,0x3f6 on irq 14
ide1 at 0x170-0x177,0x376 on irq 15
ide2 at 0xb400-0xb407,0xb802 on irq 16
ide3 at 0xbc00-0xbc07,0xc002 on irq 16
ide4 at 0xc800-0xc807,0xcc02 on irq 17
ide5 at 0xd000-0xd007,0xd402 on irq 17

hdg: Maxtor 92720U8, 25965MB w/2048kB Cache, CHS=52755/16/63, UDMA(33)
hdi: Maxtor 92720U8, 25965MB w/2048kB Cache, CHS=52755/16/63, UDMA(66)
hdk: Maxtor 92720U8, 25965MB w/2048kB Cache, CHS=52755/16/63, UDMA(33)
I would love to help you guys nail this down . . . it seems like it would be 
good both for Promise and for the kernel . . . please let me know what I 
should try in order to get this to work!!! I can patch, I can compile, I can 
pat my head while rubbing my tummy, I just don't know how to take this any 
further myself.
