If I do that, everything works correctly : the printk should take more 
than 3 us, and the altsatus is not busy when we read it.
Here is the log without moving the printk :

The only thing I could do is to move the printk between altstatus and 
status check and add one in idle_irq.
Will it be usefull for you ?
Matthieu.
