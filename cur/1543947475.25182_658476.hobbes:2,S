works for me!
applied.
thanks,

ps.  CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT's only use is to guard the use of
CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE:
#ifdef CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT
#include CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE
#endif
we could get rid of it if cpp could so something like
#if (CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE != "")
#include CONFIG_ACPI_CUSTOM_DSDT_FILE
#endif
but it doesn't look like cpp has a concept of strings in expressions.
