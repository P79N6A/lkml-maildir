I suspect I'll see a similar problem on the PowerPC.  The PPC has a way of
throttling the rate instructions are delivered from the icache to the execution
units, and thereby reducing CPU power consumption/temperature.  This slows down
the effective instruction execution speed, but all the clocks are unchanged. In
other words, udelay will break, but timing based on the timebase or decrementer
registers will be unaffected.
