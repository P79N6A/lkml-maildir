That is perfectly portable because that maps onto the hardware
registers directly, the driver is not to known whether an IO spase is
sparse or not thats handle by readl/writel. The acenic driver simply
uses the struct to generate offsets because I find it utterly ugly to
use a zillion defines to set all the offsets.
