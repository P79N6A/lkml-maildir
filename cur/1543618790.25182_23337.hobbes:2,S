Yes.  Consider the way DNS is implemented, and do likewise.  That is,
there's a library which presents a single standard interface for mapping
names (shares, hosts, whatever) to addresses in the NMB namespace.  It
can be configured to use a local nmbd if you have one, a nearby nmbd if
you choose, LDAP searching of the local ADS forest if there is one, etc.
without reconfiguring the app.s.
It might even be grafted onto the existing resolver library, although the
name resolution API may be due for an overhaul to generalize it over a
wider variety of name resolution services.
How the results are presented to app.s is a separate question, and I
believe that there are methods of implementing filesystems almost entirely
in userspace.
