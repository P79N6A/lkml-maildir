<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>Linux Community,</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2>I will be making the source code to the FENRIS 
(NetWare) File System available very soon to all of you.&nbsp; I need a couple 
of weeks to get the Copyright and License Notices in correctly as directed to us 
by Linus Torvalds, and to remove any Windows NT, MS-DOS, Free BSD, and BeOS 
specific portions of the code base so only the Linux code remains.&nbsp; 
</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT color=#000000 size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>At present, FENRIS is a single source base that supports 
several operating systems with conditional compiles.&nbsp; Some of the OS 
specific portions, such as Windows NT, contain code specific to the Windows NT 
IFS and kernel that is proprietary to MS, and will only make the code less 
readable to Linux folks (and it's probably heresy to upload any Windows NT code 
into Linux anyway -- or at the very least -- very, very, very bad 
manners!!!).&nbsp; </FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>There will be an announcement soon informing all inhabitants 
of the Planet Earth that this code will be available at <A 
href="
http://www.timpanogas.com
">www.timpanogas.com</A>.&nbsp; I appreciate 
everyone being patient with us as this is the first time we have every open 
sourced anything via this process, so please be gentle with us.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>I am the official maintainer (<A 
href="mailto:jmerkey@timpanogas.com">jmerkey@timpanogas.com</A>) so if you see 
bugs or anything else weird, then let me know.&nbsp; We are **planning** June 1, 
1999 as the official date when the tarball of FENRIS code will be uploaded to 
our site, however, I will put it up as soon as I complete the cleanup and 
&quot;beautification&quot; of the code, which may be sooner -- but not 
later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>We hope this helps the Linux community.&nbsp; Stay tuned, 
after this we are going to provide more stuff as time goes by.&nbsp; An open 
source NDS may be next in the chute.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2></FONT>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><FONT size=2>Very Truly Yours,</FONT></DIV>
