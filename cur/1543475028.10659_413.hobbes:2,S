A slightly amusing trouble here relating to OOPS logging:
An oops occurred early Sunday morning, for some reason that will never be
known, other than the fact that it occured in the middle of a bash
process. This was running a stable kernel (2.0.34) on somewhat
questionable hardware. (EIDE drive w/hard errors as root...) But it wasn't
a very severe oops, the machine was still up & running.
So I went hunting in the system logs for the Oops log. Sure enough, there
it was, 06:48:50 a Sunday morning...
"Jan  3 06:48:50 balder kernel: Unable to handle kernel paging request"...
"..."
"..."
"..."
"Jan  3 06:48:50 balder kernel: CPU:    0"
"Jan  3 06:48:59 balder syslogd 1.3-3#26: restart."
Syslogd had suddenly decided to restart, *in the middle of* logging an
Oops... :-)
