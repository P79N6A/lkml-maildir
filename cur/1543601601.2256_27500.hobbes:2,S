No it does't check. It's not needed for how it works.

select()/poll() works in a different way :
1)        select()/poll();
2)        recv()/send();
while /dev/epoll works like described above :
1)        if (recv()/send() == FAIL)
2)                wait_event();
I intentionally changed the name to epoll coz it works in a different way.
