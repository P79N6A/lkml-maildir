All the fbdev handling code in X is also an accident?
Really, why do you even push for this change if the better fix isn't that
far away.  Send the i915 driver and the other misc cleanups to Linus now
and get a proper graphics stub driver done, it's not that much work.  I'll
hack up the fbdev side once I'll get a little time, but the drm code is
far to disgusting to touch, sorry.
