For the timestamps, yes, but inode caching will take most of that
hit. After all, the only time stat() reads from disk is when the inode
has completely fallen out of the cache.
I agree that doing something like this is less than ideal, but given
that the ext2fs inode space hunt seems to be a frequently recurring
issue it should be considered as an alternative that gives us whatever
space we need for 3 full-sized timestamps and possibly for any future
ext2fs projects while preserving backward compatibility.
Of course, as I said: when suggesting this, I'm moving completely out
of my depth. I'm not ready to argue seriously for or against anything
whatsoever, but I'd appreciate an informed opinion.
Cheers,
