Yes, it's easy.

Trouble is, if you've got (say) a busy network server guzzling
GFP_ATOMIC allocations, you can't guarantee these pages.

You really want to call do_try_to_free_pages(__GFP_SWAP).  That will try
all sorts of page reclaim functions, including shrink_mmap, the dcache
shrinker and the swapper, but will never do IO.  Calling the swapper is
still useful here because we may have lots of readonly memory-mapped
pages which can be thrown out without any IO, but which can't be
reclaimed by shrink_mmap() alone.
