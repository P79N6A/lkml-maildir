The trick is making the correct spin/block decision
every time as quickly as possible with as little
information as possible.  As that ideal is probably
not attainable partial solutions such as the adaptive
mutex have been used where the spin/block decision is
made upon simple heuristics such as whether the lock
owner is currently running on another cpu.
Pushing lock acquisition policy back to the lock user is
probably going to cause more confusion/misuse/bugs that
improving overall performance.  In any case it is unlikely
to become popular in general usage and consequently won't
have the opportunity to attempt its goal.

I think you may have answered your own question above.
Optimizing for the contended case is likely past the
point of diminishing returns.  The effort may be better
spent on avoiding contention in the first place
through partitioning, reader/writer semantics, etc..
After all a lock by definition is designed to effect
synchronization by introducing delay.

I'd hazard that was more a case of sprawling evolution
rather than a conscious design decision.
