1) sis190 freezes the box when kernel PREEMPT is enabled :
I made many tries, but i could not solve it;
- it does not occur while receiving huge files.
- it does not occur when only a few packets are
  transmitted (remote connection, ls, find)
- it occurs only while transmiting huge files AND
  trying to do someting else (open a new term,...)
- I could transfer a huge file (700MB) several times
  as i was at the console (and i could switch to another
console to perform find, ls,... during the transfer).
I managed the system so the sis190 had its own IRQ, but it
made no difference.
As i suspected nvidia driver, i switched to nv driver : no result.
It seems to me that a task inside the sis190_tx_interrupt() is 
not protected against preemption (and it is probably the same
on a SMP not prempted).
I tried to play with spinlocks, but with no result :

In fact, i don't know where are the critical sections...
2) sis190 freezes the box when the link partner is
a r8169 forced in 10 full autoneg off (preempted or not
preempted kernel) :
it is probably for the same reason, as it occurs only when 
transmitting a big file.
3) poor TX performances when link partner is forced to 
autoneg off (not preempted kernel):
Once again it seems that something goes wrong with TX tasks...
