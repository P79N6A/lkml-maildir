OK, that's going to be hard to fix and it'd be awkward (and unpopular) to
make inclusion of the dynamic-ticks feature dependent on fixing this. 
(Then again, it'd get Ingo into device drivers ;))
However I would suggest that NO_HZ (at least) be dependent upon
CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL, no?
Also, NO_HZ breaks my laptop (and presumably quite a few others) quite
horridly, which means nobody can ship the feature.  Some runtime
turn-it-off work needs to be done there.

Don't know, sorry.

So you're saying that there is some patch in the -mm lineup which causes
the keyboard and mouse to die after resume-from-RAM?
What makes you think this is related to the 945G support?

Please try 2.6.19-rc2-mm2: it has a blockdev refcounting fix (well - a
change, at least) which could conceivable help here.
Also, if you're keen,
http://www.zip.com.au/~akpm/linux/patches/stuff/bisecting-mm-trees.txt
 will
allow us to identify the problematic -mm patches.  It would be super-useful
is you could do that.
Thanks.
