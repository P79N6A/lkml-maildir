Its purely an api question. We could easily take the WNOHANG flag and 
just unset it when we get it and set O_NONBLOCK instead. We need 
O_CLOEXEC anyway though, and the only reason to do it would be to get 
rid of the O_ options and take only one type of flag (that and just a 
little more waitid consistency).
