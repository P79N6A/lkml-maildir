Subject: Small problem with kernel 2.6.20 and make menuconfig

Just a small issue with the latest kernel 2.6.20. When compiling make 
menuconfig our ncurses library is not being detected. I currently use 
2.6.15 with no problem and comparing the 2 I found a script ( 
scripts/kconfig/lxdialog/check-lxdialog.sh ) in the lxdialog directory 
that checks for the ncurses lib and sets compiler flags. For some reason 
it will not find the ncurses library and thus menuconfig will not 
compile and run.
I have ncurses installed (and symlinked) in the usual locations (/lib, 
/usr/lib, /usr/include). I tried compiling the stock kernel in various 
locations ( /, /usr /usr/src ) - same problem every time. I fixed the 
problem by editing the scripts/kconfig/Makefile line 88-89 to ignore the 
script and set HOST_EXTRACFLAGS = -DCURSES_LOC="<ncurses.h>" and 
HOST_LOADLIBES = -lncurses.
menuconfig runs perfectly now ! I'm hopeless at scripts which is why I 
gave up trying to get check-lxdialog.sh to work properly - sorry...
Any queries please let me know,
Regards
Dominic Newton
