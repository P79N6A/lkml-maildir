Hi Alan.
I gather you were away when I first posted these patches, so can I
resubmit them for your comments? They are:
 1. Fix a buglet in the top level makefile which hits when one
    specifies a relative directory for INSTALL_MOD_PATH rather
    than an absolute one. Currently, the modules get put in the
    wrong directory when this happens.
 2. Increase the precision of the BogoMIPS counter to 12 bits,
    this being the safe maximum to which it can be tuned on
    all systems. The resulting values fit the description for
    this counter far better than the current values on most of
    the systems I have here, as all but one of them add four
    1's to the binary value.
 3. This patch allows the ISA NE2K driver to only claim the
    ports it actually uses when other devices have already
    claimed some of the ports that it does not use which fall
    in the range it would otherwise claim, but restricts this
    facility to when a new configuration option is defined. It
    also includes documentation for the new option.
I would like to see the first two patches included in the next 2.2
series kernel, and the first one may also be relevant for the 2.3
series kernel - I haven't tried that out as I need the VFAT file
system which is currently not supported there.
As for the third patch, I can only comment that this patch was in
use successfully on one of my systems with an ISA NE2K card set for
0x360 when ide1 was using 0x376, and I never had any problems with
it. If the printer port that occupies 0x378-0x37F is defined, then
the interface is still not auto-probed as the fact that port 0x37F
is in use is enough to say that it can't work there.
Best wishes from Riley GM7GOD / KB8PPG

+Allow overlapping non-intersecting I/O ports
+CONFIG_NE2000_PARTIAL
+  The NE2000/1000 driver actually needs just the address offsets from
+  0x00 to 0x11, plus the address offset 0x1F, within the 32 I/O ports
+  that it claims, but some clone cards incorrectly fail to decode all
+  of the address lines, thus resulting in every port being effectively
+  used by the card.
+
+  The case where this is commonly relevant is when the card has been
+  configured for port 0x360, the secondary IDE interface is using port
+  0x376, and the printer interface based at port 0x378 is ABSENT. In
+  this case, with suitable cards, this option can be enabled to allow
+  the network adapter and the secondary IDE channel to co-exist.
+
+  Note that this ONLY affects the ISA driver, as the drivers for the
+  other bus systems do not need this option.
+
+  If this means nothing to you, or you are not having problems with an
+  ISA NE2000/NE1000 ethernet interface, say N here and rest in peace.
