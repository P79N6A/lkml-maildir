I must be confused. device_initialize() sets the new device->kobj->kset 
to devices_subsys.kset. Then device_add() calls kobject_add(), which 
appends device->kobj to its kset. As we've already discussed, 
devices_subsys is a global list of all registered devices in the 
system, not a per-bus list.
It doesn't look like this will actually cause an immediate error (in 
that the sysfs directory created will be different per bus), but you 
could end up with two devices named "foo" in the devices_subsys list, 
even if they're on different busses.
