There are at least three ways of doing so:
1. rplay
2. Network Audio System (NAS)
3. AudioFile
All three are contributed software to the X Window System.  NAS and rplay
are part of Debian and Redhat (possibly only as contributed software).
The KDE folks have also been talking about a new method with lower latency
IIRC, more suitable for entertainment software...  But that is not really a
kernel related topic.
