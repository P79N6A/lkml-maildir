Ok, I finally found a simple statement of the problem in the thread
"presario laptop pcmcia loading problems".  In 2.4.23-pre8, I see
some changes to i82365.c, but nothing that would help yenta users.
Is there something in the works?  Would a kconfig workaround be
acceptible?  If so, where should it go, and what
platforms/options/sockets/devices should it depend on?
