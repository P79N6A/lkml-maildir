Introduction of deprecated warnings counts for most of the added warnings...
I like this kind summary, which is good to take the temperatue on 
the full kernel build.
Small nit-pick on the pages. Could you plave the most relevant
figures first. That is add new kernels on the top of the table.
It does not matter now, but after 30 more kernels is matters.
[Btw. nice to see that someone actually uses KBUILD_VERBOSE=0]
