Subject: [2.6.5-bk]  'modules_install' failed to install modules
Sender: linux-kernel-owner@vger.kernel.org

I pulled the latest changesets just now and found this weird behavior:
'make' and 'make install' worked as expected, but 'make modules_install'
just deleted all the old modules, ran depmod, and then installed no new
modules -- nothing.
I finally found that doing another 'make' fixed whatever the problem
was and allowed modules_install to work properly the second time.
This happened on two different machines, so I'm fairly sure it wasn't
just me having a brainfart.
