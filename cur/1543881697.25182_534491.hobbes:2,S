Aren't you a little late to the party here?  The userland version is
the one that currently is in the kernel, after all the people who said
"doing it in userland is not necessarily a good idea" got happily
ignored.  Suspend2 which is the continuity of the fully-in-kernel one
is the one that has been constantly rejected by Pavel, lately by
saying "it should be done in userspace", and hence never merged.
Incidentally, it's 13 ioctls, and it's documented in
Documentation/power/userland-swsusp.txt in a hard drive near you.  I
especially like the "get the available swap space in bytes" one that
can only handle 32 bits.
  OG.
