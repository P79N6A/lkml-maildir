That thought did occur to me, but I don't really see how that can be the
case. The ->queue_tags should be cache hot if you repeatedly call that
function, since that will never change. The request itself has been
touched by scsi_end_request() already, so unless the layout is really
bad we shouldn't need to fetch a lot of cache lines there. That leaves
__test_and_clear_bit(), I guess that must be it.
