Hi,
I use my flash disk only in linux environment. So I would like use jffs2 
filesystem on it. Is it possible ? It works like a charm on my linux-enabled 
iPAQ. 
I have 2.4.26 and 2.6.6 kernel vanillas running on i386 architectures.
Any patch exits ? And is including of this filesystem expected?
Thanks for reply
Michal
