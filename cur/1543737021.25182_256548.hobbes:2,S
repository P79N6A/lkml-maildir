 There appears to be another timer problem, too -- at least for some
boards the system timer (the 8254 PIT) has a noisy output.  When routed to
an I/O APIC input it makes the system time go fast enough the NTP daemon
isn't able to compensate (it's a few minutes per day fast).  The problem
goes away when routing it to the 8259A PIC, presumably because the 8259A
inputs are not "sticky" in the edge-triggered mode -- at the worst you
only get spurious interrupts reported in /proc/interrupts in the "ERR"
counter.
 An nVidia feedback would be appreciated.  Allen?
