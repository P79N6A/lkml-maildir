Hello,
I have the following source tree, objective is to get a single kernel
module.ko object.
module/
module/sub-module1
module/sub-module2
module/include
module/objs/
module folder has a Makefile, it may or may not have *.c files, it
invokes sub-* Makefiles
which build respective objects, these objects need to go into objs
folder, finally makefile in 'objs'
builds the module.ko linking all sub-module *.o.
I could not find much information for my requirement in the file
linux/Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt
any information with an example for my requirement is greatly
appreciated. Also let me know
how do I expose module/include in sub-module/ c files, looks like
-I../include is not working
