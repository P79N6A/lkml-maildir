I'd be glad to know "the right way".  All I have is something that seems
to work on a number of boxes :-(
There are some benefits from using it and there are some known issues.
Whoever wants to use this must decide for himself if he's willing to
take the risk.  I'll emphasise this in the documentation.

Don't get me wrong: I didn't ask for inclusion of this patch into
something official.  All I want is to tell people: here is something
that is useful for me and might be useful for you.
My point was to say, that *for me* this stuff doesn't look that
dangerous in exactly the environment it was written for:
AMD K7 + 762 + 766/768.
You have a well-defined position not to include this into the ACPI
subsystem, you pointed out your reasons for (not) doing so and I accept
that.
For me there are just a few questions left:
What is an appropiate way of announcing this patch on linux-kernel in the
future?  Does anybody feel uncomfortable with the way I did it in the
past?  Shall I cc: linux-acpi in the future, as suggested by Andrew?
