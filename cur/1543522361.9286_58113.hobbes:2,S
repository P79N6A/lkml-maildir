Ever created a loop? Happened somehow (probably a stupid joker playing
around) with something like 10 levels of directories called 'a' that looped
back through an 'a' on a VAX here (Ultrix, also BSD based). Gave me a
_really_ hard time, first to find out what was going on and then to clean
up the mess.
