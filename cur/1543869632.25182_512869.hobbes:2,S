Kevent is a _very_ small entity and there is _no_ cost of requeueing
(well, there is list_add guarded by lock) - after it is done, process
can start real work. With rescheduling there are _too_ many things to be
done before we can start new work. We have to change registers, change
address space, various tlb bits and so on - we have to do it, since task
describes very heavy entity - the whole process.
IO in turn is a very small subset of what process is (can do), so there 
is no need to change the whole picture, so it is enough to have one 
process, which does the work.
Threads are a bit smaller than process, but still it is too heavy to
have it per IO - so we have pools - this decreases rescheduling
overhead, but limits parallelism.
I think it is _too_ heavy to have such a monster structure like
task(thread/process) and related overhead just to do an IO.
