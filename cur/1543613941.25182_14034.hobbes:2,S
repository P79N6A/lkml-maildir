hah, I wish. The ARM7 has seven "exception" vectors -- that's it.
0x00 = RESET
0x04 = Undefined instruction
0x08 = Software interrupt (SWI instruction, used to escape the restricted 
USR cpu mode)
0x0C = Data abort (a very very very much lesser form of an access 
violation; accessing memory that's physically not there)
0x10 = Prefetch abort (a data abort that happens trying to read the next 
instruction)
0x14 = IRQ  <-  these two can't really even count as exceptions!
0x18 = FIQ  <-  which makes for five...
0x1C = <-
0x20 = <- Oh, yeah, and two "reserved" fields which aren't likely to ever 
be used.
Anyway, this is a bit off-topic now.
