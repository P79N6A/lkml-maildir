Thank you for your input.  But please read this note in the RFC2385:
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2385.html
 "Section 4.4: MD5 as a Hashing Algorithm"
 It talks about MD5 as an insecure algorithm and how changing it would
 require a new RFC, which make me sad.
 If you could add support for SHA-1 as well that would be nifty.
James,
  Back to your question:
    I want to replace the legacy MD5 and the incorrectly implemented SHA-1
    implementations from driver/char/random.c
Thanks, cheers!
