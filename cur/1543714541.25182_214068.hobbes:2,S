It appears that users on small memory machines running kde are not of 
concern to you. Unfortunately that describes a fair number of people, 
not everyone has the big memory fast system. I will try to get some 
reproducible numbers, but "consistently feels faster" is a reason to 
keep running -aa even if I can't quantify it.
