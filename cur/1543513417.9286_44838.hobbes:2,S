Declare an arch-specific macro which returns a function pointer from a given 
syscall number, according to the implementation of the architecture in 
question.
On just about all architectures we support at the moment, it's something 
like...
typedef int (*sysfun_p)();
extern sysfun_p sys_call_table[];
#define SYS(x) (sysfun_p)(sys_call_table[x])
