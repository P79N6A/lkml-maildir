This function delegates too much as a whole to the PCI generic layer, IMO.
Imagine that for sanity I want to allocate all the device resources, but
only _enable_ part of device features (for example only memory
transactions). Imagine some special handling to be necessary due to some
chip bug.

PCI specs said corresponding BAR must be set to ZERO, here.

I want to say the generic layer "What to do" in some more fine-grained way
than just a single verb, at least. I may accept to delegate it some "How
to do it".

In PCI, you donnot enable windows, but you enable/disable devices to
generate and/or respond to transactions. OTOH, if you look at all the bits
in the COMMAND register, you will see that some other features are also to
be addressed by the enabling/disabling kernel interface.
