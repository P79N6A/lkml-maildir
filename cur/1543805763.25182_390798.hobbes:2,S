OK.. I'll bite.  What happens when you try?  And why are you posting here - is
there *any* evidence that there is a Linux kernel bug involved?
The output of 'ifconfig' and 'netstat -r -n' would likely be helpful, as would
proof that the host(s) you're tracerouting from and to are *not* running a
firewall that interferes with the way traceroute functions. (It's amazing how
many people block all ICMP, then wonder why traceroute doesn't work... ;)
Watching the wire with 'tcpdump' and/or 'ethereal' can also help....
