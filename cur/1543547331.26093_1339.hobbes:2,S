I am not a lawyer, marketing manager, marketer, salesperson, pre-sales
person, or indeed even a "real" kernel hacker. I'm a bloody high school
student. Hence the lack of the "journalistic touch". I'm just hacking away,
hoping someone will notice, tell me everything to fix, I fix it, and in the
end I get credit, and people hail me down the streets with a ticker-tape
para</dream>

Read about the second paragraph of the initial email I sent out. A feature
writer for a well-known computer magazine here tried to contact one of the
higher deities and they more or less told him to bugger off. Do we want to
do this to ALL the press? (besides, I don't have Linus' phone number on
hand).

That was actually one of the things I red-flagged myself for and pondered
about. Then I decided I'd get flamed for it on l-k and just hoped to god
that someone would come up with something constructive.

Yeah, well scroll up. I will go and read the KDE press release, but don't
mistake me for a professional journalist, or someone who sits there all day
slamming out quality press releases.

Well, does Linus, Alan, etc, want to share their viewpoint? ATA100 is a very
good one, yes, and I actually did put in USB if you bothered to read the
press release, indeed what you pasted also. And the first thing I wrote was
about how it's so much better for SMP and 64gig of ram, and >2gig files ...

Application != kernel.

okokok, I will. But please, for the love of God, stop mistaking me for a
full time quality-bullshit^Wpress-release-artist. Because I'm not. I just
hacked out a press release one night when I was pretty tired. Don't flame me
for it.
