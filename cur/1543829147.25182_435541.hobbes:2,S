I've just had a second report about problems with 2.6.17.
Two things to try:
(1) build your kernel with CONFIG_USB_DEBUG=y and check for
interesting messages in your system logs (dmesg).
(2) use bisection to try to work out exactly which change
to the kernel caused this problem to appear.  Check out
Documentation/BUG-HUNTING in the kernel source for an
description of how to do this.
Ciao,
Duncan.
