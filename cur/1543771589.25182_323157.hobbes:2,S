This isn't an issue for VGA, as far as I know.  It applies to
architectures like PPC-64 and perhaps Alpha or PA-Risc.  And I don't know
the details; ask Grant Grundler.

I suspect you're right that implementing this only in kdump kernels will 
work okay.
For people interesting in reading some old threads on the subject, here 
are some pointers:
