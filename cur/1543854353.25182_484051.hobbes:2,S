Some of this code looked like Attansic may have meant to share it 
between drivers for atl1/atl2/atf1/atf2, but seeing as I can't find any 
code for those, I'll convert it all to atl1_ and let Attansic generalize 
the code if they ever decide they want to submit drivers.

Lacking a spec, I'm not entirely sure what the original intent was, so 
we're stuck with testing.  Is there a specific disambiguation technique 
you recommend?

Nice catch.  I admit the VLAN code is not so well audited or tested. 
Fortunately, the chip only seems to be on Asus M2V motherboards, at 
least for now, but I want to audit all of the locking code at some point.

Thanks!
