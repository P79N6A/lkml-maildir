Let me guess: You are using a setup where the swap
space resides on a different (IDE?) disk then the
main system? At least this is the setup where I can reproduce
the same problem.

Give me a sledge hammer and I will almost instantly
show you that nearly every system out there is unstable
and insecure (from physical treatment... ;-).

No it almost isn't without an *huge* performance penalty
on common processor architecutres. There are reasons
why IBM for one is making good money on MVM and such...

The kernel isn't the problem here.

Paparlapap.... apparently you don't quite understand the
issues involved. The problem are not values returned from
the kernel, but the values feed to the kernel. Along the lines
of for example exec("#!/bin/myfavoriteshell"); The stack
smash is happenning entierly inside userland before such a call.
The test you are requesting would require AI on the side
of the kernel for parameter semantics checking.
