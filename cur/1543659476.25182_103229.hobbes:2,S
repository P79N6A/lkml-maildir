Sorry, not applied.
I was kinda hoping Scott would fix that up.  It is a verified problem
(SMBus timeout, IIRC?), and this does indeed fix the problem.
However one should not udelay() that long -- especially in this case.
Since it is during init, sleep using schedule_timeout() for as long as
you want...

Please do not bother with sending BK patches like this.  Either send
just the diff, as you did (thanks), or in addition send a URL from which
I may issue
	bk pull $url
