Doesn't work unfortunately. The separate Xservers stomp on each others
toes in the process. It works if you use fbcon (thus no acceleration, no
3d), USB, and hack the X servers not to switch consoles, and take
keyboard input from /dev/input/event devices. But that's still far from
the desired state of things.
