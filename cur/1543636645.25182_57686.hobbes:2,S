Go to any of the national labs. 
I was involved in the gangscheduler implementation for the IBM 340 node SP2 
cluster at Lawrence Livermore National Lab.
Implementation aside, one can show that the total system utilization can be 
raised from ~60% to a ~90% when doing gang scheduling rather than FIFO 
scheduling, which one would otherwise do to get a dedicated machine.
We got tons of papers on this. 
For this it seems sufficient to simply STOP apps on a larger granularity and 
have that done through a user level daemon. The kernel scheduler simply 
schedules the runnable threads that given the U-Sched would always amount
to a limited number of threads/tasks.
